    "to account for the superconductivity of the alkali fullerides @xmath5c@xmath0 ( @xmath6=k , rb , cs ) chakravarty , gelfand and kivelson ( cgk ) @xcite suggested a mechanism involving purely electronic ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "they showed how this might come about by studying a simplified ( hubbard ) model of a c@xmath0 molecule and arguing that for a range of the atomic parameters the molecule exhibits `` pair - binding '' @xcite : that is , a pair of uncoupled monoanions , c@xmath7 + c@xmath7 , is unstable with respect to charge disproportionation into c@xmath0 + c@xmath2 ( and likewise for trianions and quintanions , _ mutatis mutandis _ ) .",
    "weak electronic overlaps between molecules would then lead to superconductivity .",
    "the pair - binding phenomenon was apparently related to an unusual feature of the low - lying spectra of c@xmath0 di- , tri- and , and quadr - anions ( all of which have three icosahedral multiplets of states which are themselves degenerate in the @xmath8 limit ) : namely , that hund s rule was violated and the ground states were those of _ minimum _ spin and _ minimum _ orbital degeneracy .",
    "the mechanism of superconductivity in the fullerides is currently not fully understood @xcite and the relevance of the work of cgk to that problem is controversial ; we will not shed any light on that question directly .",
    "our interest lies in examining the robustness of the pair - binding and violations of hund s rules found by cgk to e - e interactions not included in their model but expected to exist in the real materials .",
    "this issue is by no means straightforward since the quantities of interest are small differences of large energies .",
    "our work was stimulated in part by work of goff and phillips @xcite , who studied the effect of further - neighbor density - density interactions on pair - binding .",
    "we begin by defining the extension of the hubbard model studied in this paper and the quantities of interest .",
    "next , we present the results of perturbative calculations for c@xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the assignments of values for the various parameters and the corresponding values for the pair - binding energy and level splittings .",
    "to assess the validity of our approach we follow the lead of white _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and present both perturbative and exact diagonalization results for c@xmath9 , a mythical homolog of c@xmath0 that has a similar level structure at the fermi energy .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results and their implications for understanding the properties of the fullerides .",
    "we study the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 runs over nearest - neighbor pairs , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the electronic orbitals are arranged either on the vertices of a truncated tetrahedron ( c@xmath9 ) or on those of a truncated icosahedron ( c@xmath0 ) .",
    "the interaction terms are , implicitly , normal ordered .",
    "hence , appearances notwithstanding , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 terms do _ not _ renormalize the hopping and chemical potential at zeroth order . for our qualitative purposes",
    "we ignore the difference in the hopping and nearest neighbor terms between the `` short '' and `` long '' bonds , except that in the kinetic energy they are not taken to be exactly equal ( but rather , with a ratio of 1.001 ) , so as to split some accidental degeneracies and thus simplify the computer programs somewhat @xcite .",
    "the quantities of interest for us are the energies of the low - lying states and the resulting set of pair - binding energies , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the ground state energy of the molecule with @xmath18 electrons in excess of charge neutrality ; positive values of the @xmath19 indicate that charge disproportionation is favored .",
    "( the reader is warned that , in a slight abuse of this notation , we will also use @xmath17/@xmath20 with further elaboration , such as `` @xmath21/@xmath22 for the @xmath23 state of c@xmath2 , '' to indicate that energy / energy difference even when the @xmath23 state is not the ground state . )    the model with @xmath24 was studied by cgk using second - order perturbation theory in @xmath25 ; they found that the @xmath20 with odd @xmath18 become positive at intermediate values of @xmath26 .",
    "the tendency of an added @xmath27 to suppress pair - binding was noted by white _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and by goff and phillips @xcite who also included longer ranged density - density interactions .",
    "our inclusion of the leading off - diagonal ( non density - density ) terms is principally motivated by the observation that energy differences such as @xmath20 and level splittings are much more sensitive functions of the interaction parameters than the energies of the molecular states involved in their definition , and hence one may well need to keep track of interactions that nominally enter with small coefficients @xcite .",
    "these terms arise when the underlying density - density interaction is re - expressed in the wannier basis necessary to deriving the extended hubbard model .",
    "the general matrix element of the interaction @xmath28 in the wannier basis @xmath29 is @xmath30 which then specifies @xmath31 where @xmath18 and @xmath32 are nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the magnitudes of these terms have been discussed in the literature , for example by campbell , gammel and loh @xcite .",
    "the qualitative conclusions are that while @xmath33 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the relative magnitudes of the latter are sensitive to the detailed structure of the wannier function and of the effective ( screened ) interaction . to illustrate the origin of this sensitivity we show in fig .  1 a model calculation of the @xmath34-band wannier function for c@xmath0 .",
    "generally @xmath35 , but they become comparable when the interaction is screened on length scales shorter than the localization length of the wannier function ; indeed @xmath15 can even change sign @xcite .",
    "we will rely upon these estimates when we return below to the question of assigning values relevant to c@xmath0 .",
    "exact diagonalization of our hamiltonian for c@xmath0 is currently out of the question .",
    "therefore , we have followed previous work in computing the energies of the low - lying states ( those which constitute the degenerate ground state manifold in the absence of interactions ) for the anions c@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) perturbatively to second order in the various interactions .",
    "our procedure was to calculate _ total _",
    "energies for each ion . while this requires more computer time than a more sophisticated approach ( such as employed in @xcite ) that calculates energy differences with respect to c@xmath0 or c@xmath38 , it has the advantage of being straightforward to code .",
    "comparing our results for the @xmath39 terms with previous work gives a nontrivial check of the programs validity .",
    "we have not attempted to estimate directly the neglected higher order corrections ; instead we compare , below , perturbation theory with exact diagonalization results for the smaller homolog , c@xmath9 .",
    "in tables i  xiii we list the coefficient matrices for the @xmath40 , @xmath37 .",
    "the degeneracies of the various anions can be understood , literally , in a spherical approximation for c@xmath0 .",
    "the neutral molecule and c@xmath38 consist entirely of filled shells and have a unique ( @xmath41 ) ground state .",
    "the three degenerate lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumos ) of the neutral c@xmath0 molecule can be treated as an @xmath42 triplet .",
    "consequently , the low - lying states of c@xmath43 and c@xmath44 form an ( @xmath42 , @xmath45 ) multiplet , those of c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 consist of the multiplets ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , ( @xmath42 , @xmath48 ) and ( @xmath49 , @xmath47 ) and finally those of c@xmath3 consist of the multiplets ( @xmath46 , @xmath50 ) , ( @xmath42 , @xmath45 ) and ( @xmath49 , @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath46 , 1 , 2 states correspond respectively to the icosahedral representations @xmath23 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath53 and 4 , and to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "each entry in the tables is the coefficient of the term involving the product of the its row and column labels in the expansion to second order .",
    "exploring the four - dimensional phase diagram implicit in these tables is a formidable but unnecessary task , for the values of the parameters are constrained by the requirement that perturbation theory be valid and that they derive from a single underlying interaction .",
    "it is convenient to consider families of interactions @xmath58 with variable @xmath39 and fixed ratios @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 where the first constraint is incorporated ( very roughly ) by requiring that @xmath39 is bounded by the @xmath34-orbital single - particle bandwidth ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "based on the totality of the parameter values reviewed in @xcite we estimate that the second constraint is incorporated by considering @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . at the high end",
    "these values are consistent with estimates for benzene @xcite where the bare interaction is screened only by the @xmath66 bands but in that limit one would need to keep track of longer range interactions @xcite .",
    "the problem of interest , however , is that of pair - binding in the metallic phase of doped c@xmath0 , and ( _ modulo _ self - consistency ) we take the interaction to be the effective , screened interaction appropriate to this system , which will tend to give somewhat smaller values of the parameters .    before discussing our data , two remarks are in order .",
    "first , a caveat : most of the estimates that we have cited in assessing the relevant parameter ranges are from calculations using atomic orbitals and not using wannier functions .",
    "campbell , gammel and loh @xcite carried out a model calculation for a one dimensional kronig - penney model where they calculated the wannier function and found systematic deviations from the atomic orbital estimates as the screening length was varied .",
    "for our purposes the more interesting aspect of their data is that they suggest that @xmath14 and @xmath15 might be substantially smaller than we have supposed reasonable .",
    "nevertheless , it is not at all obvious whether this feature of their work , which is certainly sensitive to details of the wannier function and of the interaction , would carry over to a `` first principles '' calculation for c@xmath0 .",
    "hence we have chosen , pending a careful estimate of the parameter values relevant to c@xmath0 , to use the atomic orbital values as the appropriate ones .",
    "( also , see our concluding discussion . )",
    "second , the reader should note that particular results that do not specify the values of @xmath27 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 will correspond to a `` canonical '' set @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we are interested here in hund s first rule which implies that any degeneracies arising from a partially filled shell in excess of those dictated by symmetry be lifted in favor of the states with maximal spin . for c@xmath70 , @xmath71 , 1 , 5 and 6 , the states are either nondegenerate ( 0 ,",
    "6 ) or degenerate by symmetry ( 1 , 5 ) . for the remaining anions we find the following :    \\(1 ) * c@xmath2 : * at sufficiently small values of @xmath25 , the ground state is always the @xmath51 state consistent with hund s rule .",
    "for the pure hubbard model @xmath24 , hund s rule is violated beyond @xmath72 as the ground state crosses over to the @xmath23 state ; the @xmath52 state is always an excited state .",
    "( here and elsewhere the results for the pure hubbard case are due to cgk and are listed for comparison . )",
    "the inclusion of a nonzero @xmath27 does not shift the location of the @xmath73 level crossing very much and for @xmath74 it remains at @xmath75 .",
    "the same is true of the off - diagonal terms , including both @xmath14 and @xmath15 causes a modest downward shift in @xmath76 to about 2.7 .",
    "\\(2 ) * c@xmath3 : * here hund s rule correctly predicts that the @xmath54 state is the ground state at small values of @xmath25 .",
    "for the pure hubbard case there is a crossing to the @xmath77 state at @xmath78 .",
    "we find that this crossing is robust ; even with the further inclusion of @xmath27 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the crossing is always to the @xmath77 state and the critical value of @xmath25 is constant to within about 0.1 .",
    "\\(3 ) * c@xmath4 : * this is , roughly , the particle - hole conjugate ( within the @xmath79 manifold ) of c@xmath2 and the hund s rule state at small @xmath25 is again the @xmath51 state .",
    "the pure hubbard result of a @xmath80 level crossing at about @xmath81 is mildly decreased by the addition of further interactions , with values of @xmath82 = 2.5 ( for @xmath83 ) , = 2.6 ( for @xmath84 ) , = 2.4 ( for @xmath85 ) , and = 2.6 ( for @xmath86 ) .",
    "the pair - binding energies for even dopings , _",
    "i.e. _ for the disproportionations",
    "c@xmath2 @xmath87 c@xmath43 + c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 @xmath87 c@xmath3 + c@xmath44 , are always negative and hence pair - binding does not occur in these cases . for the odd dopings the situation is as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) * @xmath22 : * in the pure hubbard model pair - binding takes place only into the @xmath23 state of c@xmath2 and @xmath22 becomes positive for @xmath88 .",
    "the value of @xmath89 is _ extremely _ sensitive to the inclusion of further interactions .",
    "the inclusion of the next neighbor repulsion at the values @xmath90 , 0.5 changes @xmath91 to @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "of course , finding within perturbation theory a value of @xmath94 is meaningless , except to suggest that @xmath19 is _ never _ positive .",
    "this tendency of further neighbor density - density ( `` diagonal '' ) interactions to suppress pair - binding was the basis of goff and phillips s conclusion that going beyond the pure hubbard model was , for practical purposes , fatal to the correlation mechanism for superconductivity . for @xmath22 , we find that the inclusion of the off - diagonal terms , more precisely @xmath14 , can substantially affect @xmath89 .",
    "for example , at @xmath67 , the inclusion of @xmath14 at the entirely plausible level of @xmath95 of @xmath39 brings @xmath89 down to @xmath96 , just outside our nominal `` perturbative '' range .",
    "the further effect of an added @xmath15 is mildly suppressive of pair - binding , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath97 yields @xmath98 .",
    "these results are illustrated in figs .  2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "note that the ordering of the the different @xmath22 is also the ordering of the states of the c@xmath2 .",
    "\\(2 ) * @xmath99 : * here there are potentially several choices for disproportionation , but in the pure hubbard case and in the extensions studied here , both the doubly and quadruply charged anions are in the @xmath23 state _ when _ the pair - binding energy goes positive .",
    "the values of @xmath91 for this channel show modest variation .",
    "it is suppressed from the pure hubbard value of 3.3 to the value 4.1 by the inclusion of @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath27 appears to be substantially less effective in suppressing pair - binding here than in the case of @xmath22 . again",
    "the inclusion of @xmath14 enhances the pairing and at @xmath68 changes @xmath91 to about 3.6 .",
    "the further inclusion of @xmath15 has a marginal effect .",
    "\\(3 ) * @xmath101 : * for the pure hubbard case @xmath102 for the @xmath23 state ( of c@xmath4 ) and the value of @xmath89 for the @xmath52 state lies slightly outside the physical range .",
    "we find that while additional interactions greatly suppress pair - binding into the latter , their effect on pair - binding into the @xmath23 state is minor .",
    "in particular , we find the values @xmath103 , 3.9 , 3.8 , 3.7 on including @xmath27 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "this is in some contrast to the behavior of the ( clearly approximately ) particle - hole conjugate quantity @xmath22 .",
    "to assess the validity of second order perturbation theory , particularly with regard to the sign of the @xmath19 , we have followed white _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and compared perturbative and exact results for c@xmath9 . the latter has many features in common with c@xmath0 @xcite , most notably a degenerate triplet of lumos .",
    "( lammert and rokhsar @xcite have argued that the reasonable success of second - order perturbation theory for c@xmath9 , in the sense of agreement with exact diagonalization at modest values of @xmath39 , may not carry over to c@xmath0 .",
    "while their argument may well be correct , we believe it may not be relevant to the issue that is addressed below . )",
    "tables xiv  xvii list the coefficient matrices for @xmath22 in c@xmath9 .",
    "white _ et al .",
    "_ showed that for the pure hubbard model for c@xmath9 , while perturbation theory reliably predicted @xmath89 ( and even more reliably predicted the value of @xmath39 for level - crossings ) the typical value of @xmath107 was considerably overestimated for @xmath108 .",
    "we find that the _ additional _ changes in the @xmath19 due to @xmath27 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fairly well described by the perturbative results even when perturbation theory overestimates @xmath109 by a factor of three .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  5 for the case of an added @xmath14 term .",
    "it should be emphasized that this result is not entirely expected : the additional change has three terms , one coming from first - order perturbation theory , @xmath110 , and two from second - order in perturbation theory , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the last term is entirely negligible for the range of parameters in the plot . for @xmath113 , as in fig .  5 , the second term is 3/8 of the first , but since @xmath39 is already large enough that the @xmath114 term alone substantially overestimates @xmath19 ( and so there are important contributions from @xmath115 and higher ) , it is not obvious that @xmath116 and higher terms can be neglected in a calculation of the changes in @xmath19 due to the addition of a @xmath14 term .",
    "our results show that the critical values of @xmath25 for the hund s rules violating level crossings in the doubly , triply and quadruply charged anions are quite insensitive to the inclusion of all the nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "this suggests that the effects of electron correlations might be significant even for isolated anions for which pair - binding is certainly ruled out , since the energy differences between different charge states are dominated by the `` molecular capacitance '' energy . in this connection the work of negri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite merits a close examination .",
    "it is interesting they find that the ground state of c@xmath2 is a @xmath23 state rather than a @xmath51 state .",
    "however , they also find that the next - lowest state is of @xmath117 symmetry , which suggests that any useful perturbative treatment may need to employ nearly - degenerate perturbation theory and allow for occupancy of the @xmath118 molecular orbitals ( that lie roughly 1 ev above the @xmath79 lumos ) in the unperturbed states .    on the question of pair - binding we find that the @xmath14 term reduces ( using the crude measure of @xmath89 ) by about @xmath119 the suppression of pair - binding produced by the @xmath27 term .",
    "we note that in contrast to @xmath39 and @xmath27 , the @xmath14 term favors pair - binding already at _ first _ order and also favors pair - binding in second order , in each case with large coefficients .",
    "however , these large _ a priori _ effects are offset by the small numerical value of @xmath14 expected on physical grounds in c@xmath0 .",
    "the net effect of the @xmath15 term is weakly suppressive for the values of interest @xcite .",
    "goff and phillips had argued that going beyond the hubbard model necessarily suppressed pair - binding and that for parameter values relevant to the fullerides @xmath19 was always negative . at a minimum",
    "we have shown that there are interactions beyond the hubbard approximation that do favor pair - binding and , to use the framework of @xcite , open a narrow window of parameters for which this could actually take place in the doped fullerides .",
    "however , we feel that such purely microscopic considerations ought not be taken too seriously for two reasons .",
    "first , we believe that our calculations illustrate that the issue of pair - binding is quite delicate and to draw phase - diagrams with any confidence one would need to be certain that all relevant interactions had been kept , their effects calculated accurately , and the parameter values known to high precision .",
    "these are daunting challenges for current theory .",
    "second , the problem of physical interest involves _",
    "intra_molecular interactions that are necessarily renormalized by _",
    "inter_molecular dynamics ( _ e.g. _ screening ) in a self - consistent fashion @xcite .",
    "consequently , absent a solution of the full problem , it is difficult to assign properly the relevant parameter values ; _",
    "e.g. _ a modest enhancement of @xmath14 could greatly enhance pair - binding .",
    "we are _ not _ arguing that microscopics can never settle these sorts of issues , merely that in this particular problem the existence of a region of pair - binding in parameter space has been clearly demonstrated in model calculations @xcite and that the additional problem of locating precisely the parameters of the physical system does not appear amenable to first - principles solution .",
    "consequently , it would appear that consistency of the scenario with the totality of experiments is perhaps a better approach .",

    "<S> we have studied the effect of including nearest - neighbor , electron - electron interactions , in particular the off - diagonal ( non density - density ) terms , on the spectra of truncated tetrahedral and icosahedral `` hubbard molecules , '' focusing on the relevance of these systems to the physics of doped c@xmath0 . </S>",
