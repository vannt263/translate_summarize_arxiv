    "a new method to study the quantum mechanical three - body problem was recently formulated @xcite .",
    "the first significant advantage is the precise treatment of large distances where the correct asymptotic behavior of the wave function is incorporated .",
    "another advantage is the parallel treatment of bound and continuum states , which in combination with the long - range treatment opens the interesting possibility of approaching the celebrated three - body coulomb problem in the continuum .",
    "the method solves the coordinate space faddeev equations in two steps .",
    "first the angular ( and most difficult ) parts of the three - component wave functions are calculated by elaborate use of the analytical knowledge of the large - distance behavior .",
    "then the coupled set of effective radial equations is solved numerically @xcite .",
    "the new method is designed to solve the faddeev equations in coordinate space with the advantage of an immediate intuitive interpretation of the physics involved .",
    "( it may be considered as a development from the approach used to study the properties of @xmath0 @xcite . )",
    "the advantages are seen in the analytical and numerical treatment of extreme cases like the so - called efimov states @xcite , which has been suggested and looked for in both molecules @xcite and nuclei @xcite .",
    "these states occur when at least two of the two - body subsystems simultaneously have an s - state at zero energy arising from short - range interactions .",
    "the resulting infinitely many bound three - body states of @xmath1 nature are extremely extended in space and extremely weakly bound .",
    "the long range coulomb interaction between only one pair of particles destroys the effect .",
    "the large - distance coupling takes place only between s - states in different relative two - body subsystems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , low - lying three - body states often contain large components of such s - states .",
    "different treatments are usually needed when long - range interactions like the coulomb potential are involved and we shall only consider short - range interactions",
    ". we shall furthermore neglect the coupling to higher angular momenta and confine ourselves to relative s - states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to classify the lowest eigenvalues and describe how the solutions for small as well as large distances can be obtained analytically for the angular part of the faddeev equations .",
    "these solutions turn out to be exact for square - well potentials where we also can find exact solutions at intermediate distances .",
    "thus we shall derive a semianalytic s - state square - well solution to the faddeev equations .",
    "the solutions describe the efimov anomaly and how the infinitely many states continuously appear and disappear as function of the parameters of the potential .",
    "the power of the method is especially due to the analytical treatment of large distances which must be treated with particular care for loosely bound quantum systems in low angular momentum states . also the connection between two- and three - body large - distance behavior can be explored .",
    "using the analytical results for small and large distances in numerical calculations for arbitrary potentials improve both precision and computational speed and enable thereby investigations of otherwise inaccessible problems .",
    "other methods are available for investigations of the three - body problem for baryons @xcite , for borromean systems @xcite , for molecular systems @xcite as well as for coulomb interacting particles @xcite .",
    "the results from all these methods are needed in studies of the properties of a variety of different systems of interest in physics , see for example @xcite .",
    "some of the methods solve the schrdinger equation directly , but the faddeev equations are needed to describe all the subtle correlations .",
    "this is especially clearly seen in systems where two- and three - body asymptotic behavior are mixed @xcite .",
    "borromean systems , characterized by genuine three - body asymptotics only , are relatively easy to handle , whereas weakly bound systems , where both two and three - particle correlations are essential , require very careful treatment of the large distances .",
    "analytic results are rare in quantum mechanics where the schrdinger equation should be solved .",
    "the faddeev equations further complicate analytic analyses .",
    "however , so far at least one exception exists for identical spinless particles interacting via two - body harmonic oscillator potentials @xcite .",
    "this potential is infinite at large distance and scattering states therefore can not be studied .",
    "also the behavior for short - range potentials in general are excluded .    in this paper",
    "we outline in section 2 the general theoretical framework and in section 3 we solve the angular eigenvalue problem for s - states for a system of three identical bosons and spin - independent interactions . in section 4",
    "we generalize to systems of three different particles and in section 5 we consider a system with two identical spin-1/2 particles plus a third particle .",
    "in section 6 we give numerical illustrations and indicate qualitatively how to generalize the results .",
    "tedious mathematical derivations are collected in appendices .",
    "finally we give a summary and the conclusions in section 7 .",
    "the intrinsic hamiltonian of the three - body system is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mass , coordinate and momentum of the @xmath6th particle , @xmath7 are the two - body potentials , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the total momentum and the total mass of the system .",
    "we shall use the ( three sets of ) hyperspherical coordinates which consist of one radial coordinate @xmath10 ( hyperradius ) and five generalized angles @xmath11 , where i@xmath12 .",
    "the precise definitions are given in appendix a. one of these sets of hyperspherical coordinates is in principle sufficient for a complete description .",
    "the volume element is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the total wave function @xmath15 of the three - body system is written as a sum of three components @xmath16 which in turn for each @xmath10 are expanded in a complete set of generalized angular functions : @xmath17 where the radial expansion coefficients @xmath18 are component independent and @xmath19 is the phase - space factor .",
    "these wave functions satisfy the three faddeev equations @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total energy , @xmath22 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath23 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath24 .",
    "the faddeev equations may have non - trivial spurious solutions , where each component is non - vanishing while the sum corresponding to the schrdinger wave function is identically equal to zero .",
    "the components of such solutions are eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator with eigenvalues equal to the total energy .",
    "the procedure is now for each @xmath10 to solve the eigenvalue problem for the five dimensional angular part of the faddeev operator : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath10-independent part of the kinetic energy operator defined by @xmath27 explicitly the generalized angular momentum operator @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 in terms of an arbitrary @xmath30-coordinate and the angular momentum operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 related to the jacobi coordinates .",

    "other cases with more complicated spin structures can be worked out .",
    "it is straightforward , but results easily in rather extended formulae .",
    "we shall here indicate how to proceed in the case of two different spin-1/2 particles .",

    "however , simultaneously the two fermions are restricted to totally antisymmetric two - body states .",
    "this clearly removes some of the otherwise possible states .",

    "however , the picture basically remains unchanged . ) the simplest cases of small and large distances ( i and ii ) actually constitute a very large fraction of the total coordinate space .",
    "these solutions are also appropriate for general short - range potentials where the approximate validity results from perturbative treatments .    at large distances , where @xmath150 and @xmath230 can be expanded to first order in @xmath174",

    "the eigenvalue equation can in this limit be expressed entirely in terms of the scattering length of the potential . in fig .",
    "9 we show the lowest angular eigenvalue for a square - well potential as function of @xmath10 .",
    "we compare with the approximate solution at very large distances given in eq.([e104 ] ) . the @xmath174 asymptotic convergence towards the limit is clearly seen .",
    "this approximation is normally too inaccurate for the interesting shorter distances .",
    "a numerical procedure for general short - range potentials now suggest itself .",

    "the solutions are then obtained analytically in @xmath455space as described in this paper .",
    "they can be anticipated to be very accurate solutions except in smaller regions at intermediate distances , where direct numerical integration interpolating between the available analytical solutions then must be used .",
    "the gain in accuracy and speed is substantial .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "9 where we used an attractive gaussian potential of range @xmath456 and strength @xmath457 with a scattering length , @xmath458 , and an effective range , @xmath459 , where b is the range of the potential .",
    "the corresponding radius and depth of the square - well potential is then @xmath460 and @xmath461 , respectively .",
    "the curves for the two potentials are indistinguishable at large distances down to @xmath462 .",
    "then the square - well result is lowest until @xmath463 , where the curves cross and the gaussian result stays as the lowest all the way down to zero .",
    "the largest deviation is less than about 0.75 compared to the minimum value of about -6 .",
    "this relatively small region , @xmath464 , at intermediate distances , corresponds to the surface region for the two - body potential .",
    "the perturbative short - distance solution for the gaussian potential is accurate up to about @xmath465 .",
    "the large - distance behavior describing the approach towards the asymptotic limit is only a reasonable approximation at very large distances .",
    "the exact square - well solution is almost quantitatively a good approximation",
    ". the two energies would be close due to the similarities and the fact that a larger potential at smaller distance is compensated by a smaller potential at larger distance .",
    "the square well tends to confine the wave function in a somewhat more narrow region around the minimum .",
    "the ( smaller ) differences between the two potentials occur in an essential region , where a substantial part of the attractive pocket of the effective three - body potential is contained .",
    "high accuracy for an arbitrary potential therefore requires a treatment better than that corresponding to the square - well solution . in practise",
    "the most efficient procedure is numerical integration starting with the small - distance perturbative solution .",
    "reaching large distances corresponding to @xmath466 the exact square - well solution , which then is particularly simple , can be used to a very high accuracy .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two non - identical spin-1/2 particles and a third particle of arbitrary spin @xmath352 .",
    "the procedure is then the same as in section 5 , but now the spin state @xmath359 is allowed and the antisymmetrization constraint eq.([e173 ] ) is not required .",
    "the three faddeev equations can then be written as a system of six equations , where the angles @xmath467 , @xmath468 , and @xmath469 all are different . since the two fermions can couple to spin 1 , the total spin of the three - body system",
    "can be @xmath470 . in case when @xmath471 , the spin states @xmath356 , @xmath472 , and @xmath473 are not possible and the total wave function is symmetric under exchange of the two fermions , and the number of faddeev equations is again reduced to three .    at short - distances",
    "the general solutions are given by eq.([e178 ] ) .",
    "they give a 6 by 6 determinant when @xmath360 and a 3 by 3 determinant when @xmath474 . making these determinants equal to zero and solving the equation for @xmath396 one can extract the spurious solutions and the non - spurious ones for @xmath475 .    at large distances",
    "the procedure is also analogous to the one shown in the subsection 5.2 .",
    "the only difference is that now we have @xmath476 , @xmath477 , and @xmath478 , and the number of regions we have to consider ( similar to regions ii , a , b , and c in subsection 5.2 ) is much larger .",
    "technically the problem is more cumbersome , but conceptually it is identical .",
    "the new method to solve the faddeev equations in coordinate space has several advantages especially in the long - distance description .",
    "the reason is the access to the asymptotic analytic properties made possible by the two - step sequential procedure .",
    "the generalized angular equations are first solved for each average distance ( radial coordinate ) between the three particles . the periodic behavior or the finite intervals characteristic for angular variables provide discrete quantized solutions which subsequently are used as a complete basis set in an expansion of the total wave function .",
    "the expansion coefficients ( as well as the basis ) are functions of the radial coordinate .",
    "they are in the next step determined together with the total energy from the coupled set of radial equations .",
    "we have first formulated this general procedure for s - states with the inclusion of intrinsic spins for each of the three particles . for spin - independent interactions",
    "we recover the previous general s - state faddeev equations .",
    "we study the symmetric case described by three equal faddeev components .",
    "we assume spin independent interactions and arrive at one integro ",
    "differential angular faddeev equation for s - states .",
    "this equation is solved analytically for a square - well potential .",
    "the angular wave functions are especially simple at small ( one sine function ) and large distances ( one or two sine functions ) .",
    "these solutions are , with an appropriate interpretation , more general than their origin as square - well solutions seems to suggest . at small distance , they are the first order perturbative solutions for an arbitrary potential with a value at the center equal to the square - well depth . at sufficiently large distances where",
    "the general short - range potential has vanished the solution obviously is identical to the square - well solutions outside its radius .",
    "we show explicitly that the coupled set of radial equations decouple at large distances .    at intermediate distances",
    "the solutions are linear combinations of up to four sine functions of varying arguments .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are explicitly given at small distance where they vary parabolically with distance starting from the hyperspherical spectrum . at intermediate distances",
    "the eigenvalues are solutions to cubic equations and a simple trancendental equation involving trigonometric functions arises at large distances .",
    "the length scale is here defined by the radius of the square - well potential and the large - distance solution is valid when the average radius exceeds @xmath479 .",
    "expansion of the eigenvalue equation to lowest order in the inverse distance brings additional simplification , but introduces also the two - body scattering length as another length parameter . the efimov condition leading to",
    "infinitly many bound three - body states is then obtained and seen to be independent of the short - range potential .",
    "the asymmetric case , still s - states and spin independent interactions , is described by three faddeev equations .",
    "we can again solve the angular part analytically for square - well potentials acting betweeen each pair of particles .",
    "each faddeev component of the wave functions is at small and large distances of the same form as in the symmetric case .",
    "these solutions are again appropriately interpreted solutions to general potentials either in perturbation theory or asymptotically at large distances .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are in this case obtained either as solutions to a cubic equation or to a trancendental equation involving trigonometric functions . at intermediate distances the solutions",
    "can still be found analytically to be combinations of exponentials and trigonometric functions . however , the number of terms is now substantial and we abstain from writing down these soulutions .",
    "expanding the eigenvalue equation to first order in the inverse distance again brings additional simplifications and introduces the three ( different ) scattering lengths .",
    "the efimov conditions leading to infinitly many bound three - body states can then be seen to exist when at least two scattering lengths are infinitly large .",
    "asymptotic large - distance behavior of the effective radial potentials are derived to first order in the inverse distance .",
    "the case of two identical spin-1/2 fermions and one additional core particle of arbitrary spin can of course also be described by three faddeev equations .",
    "we still include only s - states and assume a spin - spin type of interaction between fermion and core particles .",
    "elimination of the spin degrees of freedom results in three angular faddeev equations where the reduction from six to three equations arise due to the requirement of an antisymmetric wave function .",
    "again these equations are solved for radial square - well potentials both for small and large distances .",
    "expansion to first order in the inverse distance expresses the angular eigenvalue equation in terms of three ( different ) scattering lengths .",
    "the efimov conditions are described and discussed .",
    "we finally considered qualitatively the case of two different spin-1/2 particles interacting mutually and with a third particle .",
    "the original three faddeev equations results now , still only including s - states , in sixcoupled angular equations after elimination of the spin degrees of freedom . small and large - distance behavior can be studied analogously for radial square - well potentials .",
    "the systems considered here containing spin-1/2 particles are chosen as the simplest examples of three interacting particles with an intrinsic structure showing up in the form of spin degrees of freedom .",
    "other similar examples can be worked out in the same way .",
    "the angular solutions obtained with square - well potentials have properties characteristic for short - range potentials . to calculate the total solution we must in addition solve the coupled set of radial differential equations .",
    "this is a rather simple numerical problem .",
    "the coupled set of radial equations decouple at large distances .",
    "only s - waves are included in the discussion , but they are usually the most interesting components in the wave functions . for bound states",
    "only s - waves extend far beyond the radii of the short - range potentials .",
    "they decouple from higher angular momentum components at large distances and often constitute the dominating part of the total wave function .",
    "the square - well solutions are intrinsically interesting .",
    "furthermore , they approach at large distance the solutions for arbitrary short - range potentials .",
    "the exact solutions are valid down to distances close to the radius of the square - well potentials . the solutions for general potentials can now be found by adjusting depth and radius of a square - well potential to obtain the same scattering length and effective range .",
    "the large - distance solutions obtained as described in this paper are then correct down to @xmath480 times the radius of the square - well potential , i.e. at much smaller distances than given by the large - distance expansion for general potentials .",
    "therefore these results can be used to make the numerical computations both substantially faster and more accurate .    in conclusion ,",
