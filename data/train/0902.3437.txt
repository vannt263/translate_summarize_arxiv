    "two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) realized at semiconductor interfaces are of continuing interest @xcite from both basic physics and technological points of view .",
    "as a function of the interaction strength , which is characterized by the ratio @xmath0 of the coulomb energy to fermi energy , many novel correlated ground states have been predicted such as a paramagnetic liquid ( @xmath1 ) , ferromagnetic liquid ( @xmath2 ) and wigner crystal ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . in the paramagnetic liquid phase , interaction typically leads to an enhancement of effective mass ( @xmath4 ) and spin susceptibility ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the land @xmath8-factor .",
    "effective mass is an important concept in landau s fermi liquid theory since it provides a direct measure of the many - body interactions in the electron system as characterized by increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the effective mass @xmath9 renormalized by interactions has been experimentally studied @xcite for various paramagnetic 2dess as a function of @xmath10 . in the highly interacting ,",
    "dilute , paramagnetic regime ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath9 is typically significantly enhanced compared to its band value , @xmath12 , and tends to increase with increasing @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "a question of particular interest is the dependence of @xmath9 on the 2d electrons spin and valley degrees of freedom as these affect the exchange interaction .",
    "recent measurements of @xmath9 for 2d electrons confined to alas quantum wells revealed that , when the 2des is fully valley- and spin - polarized , @xmath9 is _ suppressed _ down to values near or even slightly below @xmath13 @xcite . note that in these experiments , @xmath14 so that the 2des is in the paramagnetic regime , but a strong magnetic field is applied in order to fully spin - polarize the electrons . here",
    "we present theoretical calculations indicating that the @xmath9 suppression is caused by the absence ( freezing out ) of the spin fluctuations .",
    "the results of our @xmath9 calculations are indeed in semi - quantitative agreement with the measurements .",
    "previous theoretical calculations of the effective mass are mostly performed within the framework of landau s fermi liquid theory whose key ingredient is the quasiparticle ( qp ) concept and its interactions .",
    "this entails the calculation of effective electron - electron interactions which enter the many - body formalism allowing the calculation of effective mass . a number of works considered different variants of the leading order in the screened interaction for the self - energy  @xcite from which density , spin - polarization , and temperature dependence of effective mass are obtained . in these calculations",
    "the on - shell approximation  @xcite yields a diverging effective mass but the full solution of the dyson equation yields only a mild enhancement .",
    "@xcite almost all these works considered a paramagnetic 2des as past experiments concentrated on the effective mass enhancement in partially spin polarized 2d systems with @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic 2des as a model for a system of electronic carriers with band mass @xmath13 in a semiconductor heterostructure with dielectric constant @xmath15 .",
    "the bare electron - electron interaction is given by @xmath16 .",
    "at zero temperature there is only one relevant parameter for the homogeneous , ferromagnetic 2des , the usual wigner - seitz density parameter @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is the bohr radius in the medium of interest .",

    "this expression is similar to the kukkonen and overhauser interaction  @xcite where the spin - fluctuation term is dropped .",
    "a similar expression has also been reported in refs .",
    "[ ] . in eq.(2 ) @xmath34 represents the density - density response function , which in turn is determined by the local - field factor @xmath35 via the relation @xmath36",

    "the expression for the noninteracting density response function on the imaginary frequency axis is obtained for use in eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) as @xmath38 where we have defined @xmath39 .",
    "it is evident that setting @xmath40 , we recover the standard random phase approximation ( rpa ) . in",
    "what follows , we shall make the common approximation of neglecting the frequency dependence of @xmath33 .    quite generally ,",
    "once the qp retarded self - energy is known , the qp excitation energy @xmath41 , which is the qp energy measured from the chemical potential @xmath42 of the interacting ferromagnetic 2des , can be calculated by solving self - consistently the dyson equation @xmath43 alternatively , the qp excitation energy can also be calculated from @xmath44 this is called the on - shell approximation ( osa ) and it is argued  @xcite to be a better approach than solving the full dyson equation since noninteracting green function is used in eq.(1 ) . here",
    "@xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "the effective mass @xmath47 is now calculated from @xmath48 where for @xmath49 we have at our disposal the dyson and osa approaches . evaluating @xmath47 at @xmath50 , one gets the qp effective mass at the fermi contour .",
    "clearly from eqs.([epsilon ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) lff is the basic quantity for an evaluation of the qp properties .",
    "we have used the parameterized forms of lffs @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( and in particular @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spin polarization ) of moreno and marinescu .",
    "we now present our numerical results , which are based on the lff @xmath55 as input . in fig .",
    "1 we show our numerical results of the qp effective mass both in osa and dyson approximations .",
    "the qp effective mass suppression is substantially smaller in the dyson equation calculation than in the osa ; the reason is that a significant cancellation occurs between the numerator and the denominator in the effective mass expression in the dyson approach . to clarify the effect of charge - density fluctuation we have also shown the rpa results which do not take the strong many - body fluctuations into account .",
    "note that the lff takes into account multiple scattering events to infinite order as compared to the rpa where these effects are neglected . in the limit of small @xmath54 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the effective mass can be analytically shown to be @xmath57 which our numerical calculations faithfully reproduce .",
    "[ f2 ]     for @xmath19 for the ferromagnetic 2des in comparison to experiments in ref .",
    "different symbols denote different samples ; triangles : a , squares : b , circles : c , and diamonds : d. ]    in fig .",
    "2 we compare our effective mass calculations with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "the measurements were made on 2dess confined to modulation - doped alas quantum wells ( qws ) of width 4.5 , 11 , 12 , and 15 nm ( samples a , b , c , and d ) .",
    "these samples were grown on gaas substrates using molecular beam epitaxy . in bulk alas , electrons occupy three degenerate ellipsoidal conduction band valleys at the x - points of the brillouin zone with longitudinal and transverse effective masses @xmath58=1.05 and @xmath59=0.205 ( in units of the free electron mass ) .",
    "thanks to the slightly larger lattice constant of alas compared to gaas , the alas qw layer is under bi - axial compressive strain . because of this compression , the 2des in the wider qw samples ( b , c , and d ) occupy two in - plane valleys with their major axes lying in the plane @xcite . in our measurements on these samples , we applied uni - axial , in - plane strain to break the symmetry between these two valleys so that only one in - plane valley , with an @xmath60 fermi contour and band effective mass of @xmath61 is occupied @xcite . in sample",
    "a , however , thanks to its very small qw width , the confinement energy of the out - of - plane valley is lower ( because of its larger mass along the growth direction ) , so that the electrons occupy this valley and therefore have an @xmath62 fermi contour and band effective mass is @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the effective masses were deduced from the temperature dependence of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations , the details of which are given in refs .",
    "we emphasize that the data shown here ( fig.2 ) were taken on single - valley 2dess which were subjected to sufficiently large magnetic fields to fully spin polarize the electrons .",
    "it appears in fig.2 that the osa accounts overall for the observed reduction of @xmath64 below the band value reasonably well .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for the wider samples ( b , c , and d ) which have @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath4 data for the narrowest sample ( a ) , however , fall above the theoretical predictions .",
    "we do not know the reason for this discrepancy .",
    "however , we point out that , besides the difference in the shapes of the fermi contour , there is another difference between sample a and the other three samples .",
    "because of the very narrow width of sample a s quantum well and the prevalence of interface roughness scattering @xcite , the mobility of the electrons in this sample is much lower ( about a factor of 6 ) than in other samples for comparable @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that the higher disorder in sample a is responsible for @xmath4 being larger ; this conjecture is indeed consistent with the results of calculations @xcite which predict a larger @xmath4 for more disordered samples .    from figs.1 and 2 we draw two main conclusions .",
    "( i ) the rpa and present results are rather similar in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "( ii ) in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath67 ) , however , our theoretical calculations which incorporate the proper many - body effects exhibit a mass suppression , similar to the experimental data , while the rpa results show a mass enhancement and are far from the experimental data .",
    "we emphasize that the effective mass at the fermi contour is significantly suppressed in the fully polarized case because of the absence of spin - fluctuation contribution .",
    "this suppression suggests that the anti - symmetric landau parameter @xmath68 and thus higher angular momentum landau parameters may be negligible in a fully spin - polarized 2des .",
    "[ f3 ]     at @xmath69 for 2des with the combined effect of charge fluctuations in comparison to paramagnetic 2des . ]    [ f4 ]     as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath70 for a ferromagnetic 2des . ]    to gain further insight to the density dependence of @xmath71 , we have calculated the on - shell effective mass as a function of particle momentum @xmath72 using eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) evaluated at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "more specifically , we use @xmath75 for a ferromagnetic case . the results for both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic cases are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath76 for a paramagnetic 2des by using @xmath77 and @xmath78 has a sharp peak around @xmath79 where @xmath80 and a resonance like divergent behavior around @xmath81 .",
    "the peak around @xmath82 is associated with spin fluctuations and the divergent behavior around @xmath83 is related to density fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in particular , the latter divergence has been extensively studied by zhang _",
    "et al_.  @xcite within the rpa .",
    "it is related to the dispersion instability and coincides with the plasmon emission .",
    "@xmath84 for the ferromagnetic 2des , on the other hand , clearly shows the disappearance of the peak associated with spin fluctuations .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is very weakly momentum dependent for @xmath86 , since there is a substantial cancelation between the residue and the exchange plus line self - energy contribution in this regime which make the real part of the retarded self - energy approximately linear with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite the divergence associated with charge fluctuations is still present , showing a negative peak around @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath85 calculated within the rpa reproduces quantitatively the divergent behavior associated with charge fluctuations but shows some structure for @xmath88 , therefore failing to account for the absence of spin fluctuations .",
    "our density - dependent effective mass results ( figs.1 and 2 ) are consistent with @xmath89 calculations which we have checked for a range of @xmath0 values .",
    "we have also calculated the renormalization factor @xmath90 which is equal to the discontinuity in the momentum distribution at @xmath91 and defined by @xmath92 .",
    "the effect of charge - fluctuations is to make the @xmath93 values larger at large @xmath0 compared to the case when they are not included as shown in fig .",
    "this means that charge - density fluctuations tend to stabilize the system , whereas the rpa works in the opposite direction.@xcite in the present case including the lff helps preserve the fermi liquid picture in the low density regime .",
    "we have performed our numerical calculations for strictly 2des .",
    "as indicated above , experimental samples have a finite thickness in the range of @xmath94 nm . our theoretical model may be extended to include the finite quantum well width effects in the following manner .",
    "choosing , say , an infinite square well model with width @xmath95 will modify the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath96 , in which @xmath97 is a form factor.@xcite for consistency , one should also calculate the local - field factor @xmath55 using the same model for the finite width effects .",
    "this would provide a better comparison with experiments .",
    "in our case , the local - field factor we use was constructed@xcite by the quantum monte carlo data for a strictly 2des and it is not straightforward to incorporate the finite with effects within such an approach .",
    "previous calculations@xcite of the effective mass for a paramagnetic 2des suggest that the effect of a finite thickness is to suppress @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we surmise that a similar qualitative effect would occur for the ferromagnetic 2des .",
    "on the other hand , the finite temperature and disorder effects have a tendency to enhance the effective mass@xcite which may lead to a cancellation .",
    "these issues require a more systematic study .",
    "in conclusion , our theoretical calculations incorporating the proper pauli - coulomb hole and multi - scattering processes show that in an interacting , fully spin - polarized 2des the absence of spin fluctuations reduces the effective mass below its band value , in agreement with experimental data .",
    "our results also demonstrate the inadequacy of rpa to account for the observed effective mass suppression .",
