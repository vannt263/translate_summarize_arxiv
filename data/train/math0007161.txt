    "as richard stanley so astutely observes in @xcite , `` the number of systems of terminology presently used in graph theory is equal , to a close approximation , to the number of graph theorists . '' our terminological conventions in this paper will be the following : given a finite @xmath1-valent graph , @xmath0 , we will denote by @xmath12 the vertices of @xmath0 and by @xmath13 the oriented edges of @xmath0 . for each oriented edge , @xmath4 , we will denote by @xmath14 the edge obtained by reversing the orientation of @xmath4 and by @xmath15 and @xmath16 the initial and terminal vertices of @xmath4 .",
    "( thus `` @xmath1-valent '' means that for every vertex , @xmath17 , there are exactly @xmath1 edges with @xmath18 . )    let @xmath2 be a torus of dimension @xmath19 , and let @xmath20 be a function which associates to every oriented edge , @xmath4 , of @xmath0 , a one - dimensional representation , @xmath21 , of @xmath2 , with character @xmath22 , and @xmath23 a function which associates to every vertex , @xmath17 , of @xmath0 , a @xmath1-dimensional representation , @xmath24 , of @xmath2 .",
    "we will say that @xmath20 and @xmath23 define _ an action of _",
    "@xmath2 _ on",
    "_ @xmath0 if they satisfy the three axioms below :    axiom a1 : @xmath25 axiom a2 : @xmath26 axiom a3 :    let @xmath27 be the kernel of @xmath28 and let @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31    the data @xmath32 can be viewed as the schematic description of a genuine @xmath2-action , namely an action of @xmath2 on a @xmath1-dimensional complex manifold , @xmath33 , having the following properties :    1 .   :",
    "the fixed point set of @xmath2 is @xmath12 , and , for every @xmath34 , @xmath24 is the isotropy representation of @xmath2 on the tangent space to @xmath33 at @xmath17 .",
    "each edge , @xmath4 , of @xmath2 , corresponds to a @xmath2-invariant imbedded projective line , @xmath35 .",
    "the points @xmath36)$ ] and @xmath37)$ ] are the two fixed points for the action of @xmath2 on @xmath38 , and @xmath21 is the isotropy representation of @xmath2 on the tangent space to @xmath38 at @xmath17 .",
    "these properties are exhibited by a class of manifolds , called _ gkm manifolds _ , which were first introduced in @xcite by goresky , kottwitz and macpherson and have subsequently been studied in a number of recent papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) by ourselves and by others . by definition ,",
    "a complex @xmath2-manifold , @xmath33 , is _ gkm _ if , for every fixed point , @xmath17 , of @xmath2 , the weights , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , of the isotropy representation of @xmath2 on the tangent space to @xmath33 at @xmath17 are pairwise linearly independent : _ i.e. _ @xmath39 and @xmath41 are linearly independent if @xmath42 .",
    "for such a manifold we define its _ one - skeleton _ to be the set of points , @xmath43 , for which the stabilizer group of @xmath17 is of dimension at least @xmath44 .",
    "what goresky , kottwitz and macpherson observe is that this one - skeleton consists of closed submanifolds of @xmath33 on which @xmath2 acts in a fixed point free fashion and imbedded @xmath45 s satisfying p1-p2 .",
    "in @xcite we proved a converse to this result .",
    "let @xmath46 be a graph - theoretical @xmath2-space in the sense described above .",
    "for @xmath47 let @xmath5 be the weight of the representation , @xmath21 , and assume that for every vertex , @xmath17 , of @xmath0 , the weights @xmath5 , @xmath18 , of the representation , @xmath24 , are pairwise linearly independent . then there exists a complex @xmath2-manifold , @xmath48 , of gkm type , whose one - skeleton has the properties p1-p2 .",
    "( in fact , @xmath48 is canonically constructed from the data @xmath32 and is basically just a tubular neighborhood of this one - skeleton . )    from axiom a1 , it is clear that the function , @xmath49 , determines the function , @xmath23 ; and @xmath49 , in turn , is determined by the function @xmath50 in the geometric realization of @xmath0 which we described above this function tells us how each of the two - spheres in the one - skeleton is rotated about its axis of symmetry ; so we will call this function the _ axial function _ of the @xmath2-action on @xmath0 . the axioms ,",
    "a1-a3 , can easily be translated into axioms on this axial function ( as we will do in section [ sec:2 ] ) .    by realizing @xmath32 as a @xmath2-manifold , @xmath48",
    ", we can attach to it a cohomology ring : the equivariant cohomology ring , @xmath51 .",
    "the constant map , @xmath52 , makes this into a module over the ring , @xmath53 ; and we will denote by @xmath10 the torsion - free part of this module .",
    "the questions we will be concerned with in this paper are :    1 .",
    "is this module a free @xmath11-module ?",
    "2 .   if so , how many generators does it have in each dimension ?",
    "3 .   is there a nice combinatorial description of these generators",
    "?    we will now formulate these questions more precisely .",
    "we will henceforth abandon any pretense of being concerned with @xmath2-actions on manifolds and deal only with @xmath2-actions on graphs .",
    "fortunately , there is a very beautiful description in @xcite of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath54 which allows us to do this .",
    "fix a vector , @xmath55 , with the property that @xmath56 for all @xmath47",
    ". we will call such a vector _ polarizing _ , and denote by @xmath57 the set of polarizing vectors . by axiom a2 @xmath58 so we can orient @xmath0 by assigning to each unoriented edge , the orientation which makes @xmath59 positive",
    ". we will denote this orientation by @xmath60 . to be able to do morse theory on @xmath0",
    "we make the following essential assumption .    for some @xmath61 satisfying , the orientation , @xmath60 , of @xmath0 that we have just described has no oriented cycles .",
    "we will say that @xmath7 is _",
    "@xmath61-acyclic _ if this axiom is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath62 .",
    "the acyclicity assumption implies that one can find a function @xmath63 with the property that , for every oriented edge , @xmath4 , of @xmath0 , with initial vertex @xmath17 and terminal vertex @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we will say that such a function is @xmath61-_compatible _ and call any function with this property a _",
    "morse function_. a canonical choice of such a @xmath66 is the following : for every vertex , @xmath17 , consider all oriented paths in ( @xmath0 , @xmath60 ) with terminal point @xmath17 and let @xmath67 be the length of the longest of these paths .",
    "it is clear that for this function to be unambiguously defined , @xmath0 has to satisfy the acyclicity assumption . by a small perturbation if necessary , we may assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath66 is injective .",
    "following @xcite we define the _ cohomology ring _ , @xmath10 , of @xmath7 , to be the subring of the graded ring @xmath68 consisting of all maps , @xmath69 , which satisfy @xmath70 for every edge , @xmath4 , of @xmath0 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 being the values of @xmath73 at the endpoints , @xmath17 and @xmath64 , of @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath71 and @xmath72 are elements of @xmath11 , they can be thought of as polynomial functions on @xmath74 and asserts that the restriction of @xmath71 to the hyperplane @xmath75 is equal to the restriction of @xmath72 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath76 , then the projection @xmath77 induces an epimorphism of rings @xmath78 and condition can be expressed as @xmath79    since the constant maps of @xmath80 into @xmath11 satisfy , @xmath11 is a subring of @xmath10 ; so , in particular , @xmath10 is an @xmath11-module .",
    "moreover , since it sits inside the free @xmath11-module , it is a torsion - free module .",
    "it is not , however , _ a priori _ clear that it is itself a free module ; this `` freeness '' issue is the first of the three questions we will take up below .",
    "the second question concerns the number of generators of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a morse function , and , for every vertex , @xmath17 , let @xmath81 be the number of vertices , @xmath64 , adjacent to @xmath17 , with @xmath82 .",
    "this number , called _ the index of @xmath17 _ ( and also denoted by @xmath83 ) , is the same as the number of oriented edges , @xmath4 , with @xmath18 and @xmath84 .",
    "we define _ the @xmath85-th betti number _ , @xmath86 , to be the number of vertices with @xmath87   to denote this number ; also , the @xmath85-th homogeneous component of @xmath10 is denoted there by @xmath88 and here by @xmath89",
    ". one can show ( ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.6 ) ) that these numbers do nt depend on @xmath61 or @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ are graph - theoretic invariants",
    ". our question about the number of generators of @xmath10 can be formulated as a conjecture :    the dimension of the @xmath85-th graded component of the ring @xmath90 is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that the orientation @xmath60 depends only on the connected component of @xmath57 in which @xmath61 sits . on the other hand",
    "it is clear that different components will give rise to different orientations .",
    "for instance , replacing @xmath61 with @xmath91 reverses the orientation and changes a vertex of index @xmath85 into a vertex of index @xmath92 . therefore @xmath93    finally , what do the generators of the ring @xmath10 actually look like ? for a vertex @xmath17 of @xmath0 , let @xmath94 be the _ flow - up of @xmath17 _ , _ i.e. _ the set of vertices of the oriented graph @xmath95 that can be reached by a path along which the morse function @xmath66 is strictly increasing .",
    "( @xmath94 is the graph theoretic analogue of the `` unstable manifold '' at a critical point , @xmath17 , in ordinary morse theory . )",
    "we also define the _ flow - down of _",
    "@xmath17 to be the set of vertices of the oriented graph @xmath95 from where we can reach @xmath17 by a path along which the morse function @xmath66 is strictly increasing .",
    "note that the flow - down of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath60 is the flow - up of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "our conjecture is that , just as in ordinary morse theory , @xmath10 is generated by cohomology classes dual to these `` unstable manifolds '' .",
    "more explicitly :    there exists a set of independent generators @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these conjectures is true without some extra assumptions on @xmath7 .",
    "( an example of a pair @xmath7 for which both conjectures fail to hold is described in ( * ? ? ? * section  2.1 ) ) .",
    "therefore , making a virtue of necessity , we will declare , by definition , that @xmath7 satisfies _ the morse package _ if @xmath10 is a free @xmath11-module and if the two conjectures above are true .",
    "we can now formulate the main result of this paper .",
    "let @xmath99 be a linear subspace of @xmath74 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 its dual , which we can identify with @xmath102 define @xmath103 to be the subgraph of @xmath0 whose edges are all edges , @xmath4 , of @xmath0 for which @xmath104 .",
    "[ th : main1 ] if @xmath7 satisfies the morse package , then , for every @xmath101 as above , @xmath105 satisfies the morse package .",
    "conversely , if @xmath105 satisfies the morse package for all @xmath106 of dimension 2 , then @xmath7 satisfies the morse package .    * the flag variety , @xmath107 , @xmath108 . *",
    "the graph @xmath0 is a cayley graph associated with the permutation group , @xmath109 . for this graph , @xmath110 , and two permutations , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , are adjacent in @xmath0 if and only if there exists a transposition @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath4 is the edge joining @xmath115 to @xmath116 , the weight labeling @xmath4 is @xmath117 @xmath118 being the standard basis vectors of the lattice @xmath119 .",
    "the function @xmath120 is a self - indexing morse function on @xmath80 ; our theorem says that for @xmath7 to satisfy the morse package , it suffices to check that the subgraphs associated with the subgroups @xmath121 and @xmath122 of @xmath109 satisfy the morse package .",
    "this can be done more or less by inspection .",
    "for instance the graph associated with @xmath122 is the permutahedron ( see figure [ fig : perm ] ) and its `` thom classes '' are given by simple monomials of degree 1 , 2 and 3 in @xmath123 and @xmath124 , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( see the table below ) .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * the grassmannian @xmath127 .",
    "* here the graph in question is the _ johnson graph _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "its vertices are the @xmath85-element subsets , @xmath128 , of the @xmath3-element set @xmath129 , and two vertices , @xmath130 , @xmath112 , are adjacent if @xmath131 is a @xmath132-element set , or , in other words , if @xmath133 and @xmath134 are one - element sets . if @xmath4 is the oriented set joining @xmath135 to @xmath121 the weight labeling this edge is @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the standard basis vectors of @xmath119 . to define a morse function on @xmath80 we first observe that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the vertices of @xmath0 and young diagrams ( @xcite ) .",
    "namely , let @xmath128 be a @xmath85-element subset of @xmath129 , with elements @xmath140 .",
    "then we make correspond to @xmath128 the young diagram , @xmath141 , with rows of length @xmath142 by means of this correspondence we can define a self - indexing morse function , @xmath66 , on @xmath80 , by setting @xmath143    for the johnson graph , our theorem says that to verify the morse package for @xmath0 , it suffices to verify the morse package for the johnson graph associated with the two - element subsets of @xmath144 , and just as in the previous example , this can be done more or less by inspection .",
    "a few words about the contents of this paper : we mentioned above that the axioms a1-a3 can be translated into axioms on the axial function , @xmath54 . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we will do this and also give more precise definitions of some of the concepts that we have mentioned in this introduction . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we will prove the easy part of our main theorem , the `` only if '' part .",
    "the hard part of the theorem , the `` if '' part , requires some algebraic results about vandermonde matrices which we will discuss in the appendix .",
    "another ingredient in our proof is an _ integration _ operation on graphs .",
    "given an element , @xmath73 , of the ring , we define its _ integral _ over the graph to be the sum @xmath145 the denominator in the @xmath146 summand being the product over all oriented edges , @xmath4 , with @xmath18 .",
    "the expression on the right appears to belong to the quotient field of @xmath11 ; however , if @xmath147 , one can show that this sum is in @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 has the following duality property :    [ prop : dual ] if @xmath148 and @xmath149 for all @xmath150 , then @xmath147 .",
    "these results are old results of ours from @xcite , but to prove the main theorem , we will need to generalize them to _ hypergraphs_. ( a hypergraph is , like a graph , an object consisting of vertices , hyperedges and an incidence relation which tells one when a vertex is incident to a hyperedge . for hypergraphs , however , more than two vertices can be incident to a hyperedge . )    a third ingredient in our proof is a `` cross - section '' construction for graphs which we already made extensive use of in @xcite . a real number , @xmath151 , is a _ critical value _ of the morse function @xmath66 if @xmath152 for some @xmath153 ; otherwise , it is a _",

    "then @xmath154 is the vertex set of a hypergraph , @xmath157 , whose edges are the intersections of the level set @xmath158 with the connected components of the graphs @xmath103 , @xmath101 being a dimension 2 subspace of @xmath159 .    the trickiest and most subtle part of our proof is figuring out how to define the cohomology ring of this hypergraph .",
    "one can equip @xmath157 with an analogue of the axial function , @xmath54 , ( see section [ sec : localiz ] ) and mimic the definition of @xmath10 ; however , this turns out _ not _ to be the right approach .",
    "trial and error show that the right approach is to mimic the definition of @xmath10 `` by duality '' in proposition [ prop : dual ] .",
    "( see section [ sec:5 ] for details ) .",
    "this approach , however , has one apparent short - coming : the equivariant cohomology theory of graphs that we described above is a _ local _ theory in the sense that a prospective cohomology class , @xmath160 , belongs to @xmath10 if and only if it satisfies condition at each edge .",
    "if we define hypergraph cohomology by duality it is not at all clear that it will be a local theory in this sense .",
    "the localization theorem which we prove in section [ sec : localiz ] shows , however , that it is .",
    "denoting the cohomology ring of @xmath157 by @xmath161 , we show in section  [ sec:6 ] how the proof of the main theorem can be reduced to the following problem : how does the structure of @xmath161 change as one passes through a critical value of @xmath66 ?",
