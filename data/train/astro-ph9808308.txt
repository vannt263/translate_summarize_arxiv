    "cluster studies based on the sunyaev  zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite have had a long and hard history of learning about systematic effects . benefiting from these early efforts and thanks to new technologies ( bolometers ) and observing techniques ( interferometry )",
    ", the field is now in rapid expansion . at one time",
    "the issue was simply one of detection ; today , we speak of several tens of clusters with high signal  to  noise sz _",
    "maps_. the change has been revolutionary in its rapidity , and it has taken place somewhat unbeknownst to those outside the field .    in this contribution , we will summarize what is happening by discussing the kind of astrophysics one can do with the sz effect and the impact of current observations . by far ,",
    "the best and most complete recent review of the subject is given by birkinshaw @xcite .",
    "we have been inspired both by this review and by the review given by lange @xcite .",
    "we begin with a few general remarks concerning the sz effect .",
    "there are some aspects of the sz effect particularly worth emphasizing . recall that the effect is a distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum that may be expressed as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the change in surface brightness of the cmb at position @xmath2 on the cluster face relative to the unperturbed cmb spectrum . the quantity @xmath3 gives the spectral shape of the distortion and is only a function of frequency .",
    "the magnitude is set by the _",
    "compton @xmath4-parameter _ , an integral of the electron pressure along the line  of  sight : @xmath5 here , the electron temperature , mass and density are @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath9 is the thompson cross section . integrating over the cluster face , we find the _ total _ sz flux density : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular  size distance .",
    "there are two important observations to make : 1/ @xmath12 , i.e. , the effect falls off with redshift much more slowly than does , say , an x  ray flux , which is simply the well known fact that the surface brightness of the effect is independent of redshift for a fixed cluster ; 2/ we may rewrite the expression as @xmath13 in terms of @xmath14 , the hot gas mass fraction , @xmath15 , the total virial mass of the cluster , and an average temperature defined by this expression , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total number of electrons in the cluster .",
    "this is an important aspect of the sz effect , because the average temperature involved is truly the _ mean temperature _ of the electrons in the gas , as opposed , say , to the emission  weighted , x  ray measured temperature .",
    "the sz  defined temperature is directly related to the total energy of the electrons gained during collapse and _ totally insensitive _ to the spatial distribution of the hot gas in the cluster .",
    "these two points distinguish the sz distortion from the x  ray flux of a cluster and can be used to advantage in cluster studies .",
    "as discussed by birkinshaw @xcite , there are three techniques used to observe the sz effect : traditional single  dish observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , bolometers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and interferometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "interferometric observations now routinely produce sz maps at more than 20 @xmath18 at the center .",
    "bolometer observations have also detected the sz effect in emission @xcite .",
    "such observations can be used to deduce cluster baryon fractions @xcite , constrain ( eventually detect ) cluster peculiar velocities @xcite , @xcite and to trace total cluster mass profiles . in the former and latter cases ,",
    "the density insensitivity of the sz effect is a pertinent advantage over x  ray studies ( sz varies linearly with @xmath8 ) .",
    "combined x ",
    "ray and sz observations lead to distance estimates and a hubble diagram .",
    "figure 1 shows such a diagram from data we gleaned from the literature ( the diagram was inspired by birkinshaw @xcite , although the data is not exactly the same ) .",
    "here we refer to purely sz surveys where clusters are selected from `` blank '' sky soley on the basis of their sz flux density .",
    "such surveys are just feasible today . surveys of this kind should be viewed as totally analogous to x  ray surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) : one can study sz luminosity functions and their evolution ( closely related to the amount and evolution of the intracluster medium ) , the cluster contribution to the mean background ( mean distortion of the cmb spectrum ) and to the background anisotropies , and redshift distributions . as discussed in @xcite , @xcite , the latter can be used to constrain the density parameter , @xmath19 . particularly enticing",
    "are the reports of sz decrements with no optical or x  ray counterparts @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if truly due to clusters , these must be at very large redshifts ( @xmath20 ) , a fact difficult to account for in a critical universe @xcite ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we are now in a position to reap the potential of sz observations .",
    "catalogs of pre  selected clusters observed in sz ( pointed surveys ) already count several tens of entries , permitting for the first time statistical studies .",
    "true blank field surveys will soon be undertaken over small patches of sky with interferometers and , eventually , with large bolometer arrays @xcite ; over the longer term , one anticipates a sz  selected catalog of more than 10,000 sources from the planck surveyor @xcite , a remarkable opportunity .",
