    "the euclidean log convex density theorem , proved by gregory chambers [ ch ] in 2015 , asserts that in euclidean space with a log convex density spheres about the origin are isoperimetric ( minimize perimeter for given volume ) .",
    "the analogous conjecture in hyperbolic space , @xmath0 , says that for a log convex density , spheres about the origin are isoperimetric .",
    "we prove an easier version in which the perimeter is weighted by a larger density than the volume :    * theorem [ weakhyperbolic]*. _ consider @xmath0 with smooth , radial , log convex volume density @xmath1 and perimeter density _",
    "@xmath2    _ where @xmath3 is distance from the origin",
    ". then spheres about the origin are uniquely isoperimetric .",
    "_    note that a smooth radial density is log convex if and only if it is a log convex function of @xmath4 .",
    "the problem of perimeter minimization is an ancient one .",
    "two thousand years ago , zenodorus showed that planar circles are perimeter minimizers for given enclosed area .",
    "similar results were proven over the past 150 years for spheres in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath0 as well ( see [ mo , 13.2 ] ) .",
    "more recently , mathematicians have studied manifolds with density .",
    "a density @xmath7 is a positive function defined on a manifold . for a region @xmath8 , the weighted volume of @xmath8 with respect to density @xmath7 is @xmath9 and the weighted area of its boundary is @xmath10 the interest in manifolds with density is partially due to its role in perelman s 2002 proof of the poincar conjecture [ mo , chapt . 18 ] .",
    "two important steps are needed in establishing this result .",
    "firstly , we use the poincar ball model of hypebolic space to reduce the problem to the open ball in @xmath5 with equal volume and perimeter densities which diverge at the boundary .",
    "secondly , proposition [ noboundary ] shows that a component of an isoperimetric region must be bounded .",
    "otherwise we carefully truncate the region and restore the volume elsewhere to get a good candidate which nonetheless must have no less perimeter .",
    "this inequality , paired with other differential inequalities relating the boundary of the truncation to the rate of volume growth , forces the volume outside the ball of radius @xmath11 to reach 0 in finite time .",
    "section 2 provides notation .",
    "section 3 begins with an explicit formula ( lemma [ tanh ] ) relating poincar ball and exponential coordinates on @xmath0 .",
    "proposition [ equiv ] shows that our unequal densities on @xmath0 are equivalent to equal densities on the euclidean ball .",
    "propositions [ existnball ] and [ noboundary ] after morgan - pratelli [ mp , thms .",
    "3.3 , 5.9 ] establish the existence and boundedness of isoperimetric regions .",
    "now the local analysis of chambers [ ch ] for equal densities on euclidean space completes the proof of our main theorem [ weakhyperbolic ] .",
    "we would like to thank the nsf reu grant program , williams college ( including the finnerty fund ) , stony brook university and the mathematical association of america for funding .",
    "additionally , we would like to thank our advisor frank morgan for valuable input and discussions throughout our research .",
    "here we provide a reference for the notation used in many of our lemmas and propositions .",
    "[ figurr ]    as in figure 1 , in both hyperbolic and euclidean space , denote the sphere and ball of radius @xmath11 by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the unweighted measure of a surface or region @xmath15 . for a region @xmath16 ,",
    "let @xmath17 be the slice of @xmath16 by the sphere @xmath12 ( see [ mo , 4.11 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be the restriction of the boundary of @xmath16 to the exterior of the ball @xmath13 and define @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the restriction of @xmath16 to the ball @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath22 be the volume of the restriction of @xmath16 to the exterior of the ball @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the perimeter of @xmath17 . in the presence of any density @xmath7 ,",
    "apply @xmath7 as a subscript to indicate weighted volume or perimeter .",
    "after two lemmas , proposition [ equiv ] equates hyperbolic space with unequal densities to the euclidean ball with equal densities .",
    "propositions [ existnball ] and [ noboundary ] prove existence and boundedness . our main theorem [ weakhyperbolic ]",
    "now can apply chambers [ ch ] to prove spheres uniquely isoperimetric in @xmath0 with our unequal densities .",
    "thus , a function @xmath26 can be considered a radial density on hyperbolic space as a function of distance from the origin by computing the composition @xmath27 .",
    "this allows for comparison between densities on hyperbolic space and densities on the euclidean ball .",
    "lemma [ convex ] establishes that log convexity of @xmath28 on @xmath29 implies log convexity of @xmath30 on @xmath31      let @xmath32 be a smooth function with @xmath33 positive and @xmath34 negative . if the composition of a smooth positive nondecreasing function @xmath7 with @xmath32 is log convex , then @xmath7 is log convex .",
    "take any smooth radial density on hyperbolic space .",
    "let @xmath37 be the density as a function of poincar radial coordinate @xmath11",
    ". then if the density is log convex , @xmath30 must be nondecreasing and when composed with @xmath38 is log convex on @xmath39 .",
    "taking @xmath32 to be @xmath38 provides that @xmath30 is log convex on @xmath40 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the hyperbolic metric in poincar coordinates is a conformal rescaling of that on the euclidean ball . by the effects of conformally rescaling a metric",
    ", we see that hyperbolic space has the same isoperimetric profile in poincar coordinates as the open unit euclidean ball with with area density @xmath41 and volume density @xmath42 .",
    "we are now able to establish the equivalence between hyperbolic space with density and the euclidean ball with density :    [ equiv ] @xmath0 with radial volume density @xmath1 and perimeter density @xmath43is equivalent to the open unit euclidean ball with density @xmath44 where @xmath3 is hyperbolic distance from the origin and @xmath11 is euclidean distance from the origin .",
    "note that @xmath45 .",
    "so , the perimeter density may be written as @xmath46 by lemma [ tanh ] , we may rewrite these functions in poincar coordinates to see that the volume density becomes @xmath47 and the perimeter density becomes @xmath48 where @xmath11 is the radial poincar coordinate . finally , let @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the euclidean volume and area elements . then in poincar coordinates , the weighted volume element is @xmath51 and the weighted area element is @xmath52 these volume and area elements are equivalent to those on the described weighted euclidean ball .",
    "having demonstrated this equivalence between @xmath0 and the unit ball with certain densities , we are now ready to make statements about existence and boundedness of isoperimetric regions .",
    "first , we need a brief lemma relating area of slices of a region to the perimeter of its boundary .",
    "[ projection ] let @xmath16 be a region in either @xmath0 or the unit ball in @xmath5 with continuous , nondecreasing radial volume density , with infinite weighted radial distance to the boundary in the ball case . if @xmath16 has finite weighted volume then for any @xmath11 , @xmath53    since the radial projection @xmath54 of the exterior onto @xmath55 is area nonincreasing , it suffices to show that @xmath56 covers @xmath17 , up to set of measure zero . if",
    "not , then a set of positive measure in @xmath17 is not in the projection .",
    "the product of this set with either @xmath57 or @xmath58 , depending on the space , is contained in @xmath16 .",
    "but this set must have infinite weighted volume , violating our assumption of finite weighted volume .      [ existnball ]",
    "isoperimetric regions exist in @xmath0 with nondecreasing , continuous radial volume density @xmath59 and radial perimeter density @xmath60 , where @xmath3 is distance from the origin , for all volumes .    by proposition [ equiv ] ,",
    "it is enough to show that isoperimetric regions exist on the open unit euclidean ball with radial density @xmath61 consider a sequence of regions of the prescribed volume with perimeter tending to the infimum . by compactness [ mo , 9.1 ]",
    "we may assume convergence of a subsequence to a perimeter - minimizing region .",
    "the difficulty is that the enclosed volume may be strictly less than the prescribed volume , that some volume disappears to infinity . in that case , for some @xmath62 , for all @xmath11 , for a tail of the sequence , the volume outside the ball of radius @xmath11 about the origin is at least @xmath63 .",
    "fix @xmath64 and such a region @xmath16 , determined by @xmath64 , in the tail of the sequence . using the notation established in section 1",
    ", we have      because @xmath7 satisfies the conditions of lemma [ projection ] , we know @xmath66 converges to zero as @xmath11 tends to 1 , as it is bounded above by @xmath19 which must also converge to 0 .",
    "hence , when @xmath11 is chosen close enough to 1 , @xmath66 is no larger than half the unweighted surface area of the sphere of radius @xmath11 .",
    "when this condition holds , we may apply the standard isoperimetric inequality , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is some dimensional constant .",
    "take note that the function @xmath19 is nonincreasing , so it must be differentiable almost everywhere , and by extension , @xmath73 is diffferentiable almost everywhere . by standard slicing theory [ mo , 4.11 ] , for almost all @xmath11 ,                    [ noboundary ]",
    "isoperimetric regions are bounded in @xmath0 with nondecreasing , continuous radial volume density @xmath59 and radial perimeter density @xmath60 , where @xmath3 is distance from the origin .",
    "the standard isoperimetric inequality on the sphere tells us that for any @xmath11 for which @xmath66 is at most half of the area of @xmath12 , one has @xmath83 where @xmath68 is some positive dimensional constant . because @xmath19 is bounded by @xmath84 , which is finite because @xmath85 is finite and @xmath7 is bounded below , there exists an @xmath86 for which @xmath70 implies @xmath66 is at most half of the area of @xmath12 .",
    "that is , holds for all @xmath11 large enough .",
    "because the @xmath7 density on @xmath17 is constant , we may multiply inequality by @xmath87 to obtain @xmath88    for @xmath11 large enough , and where we absorb the power of 2 into constant @xmath68 . noting that @xmath30 is bounded below by some constant",
    "we may absorb this lower bound into a new constant @xmath68 to obtain      note that we have taken negative powers of @xmath66 , which may be zero if @xmath16 is disconnected , however for such values of @xmath11 , every quanity in the inequality is zero and so the statements hold trivially .",
    "furthermore , we are justified in taking a negative power of @xmath90 as it is never zero , because @xmath16 is unbounded .",
    "because @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath7 are monotonic functions , @xmath91 and @xmath73 are differentiable almost everywhere . by morgan [ mo , 4.11 ] , and",
    "hold almost everywhere .              where @xmath68 may change from line to line .",
    "because this inequality holds for almost all @xmath11 large enough , we may perform an integration from any choice of @xmath11 large enough to @xmath95 .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 may not be continuous , but it is increasing , so the integral of this quantity is no larger than the absolute change in @xmath97 . knowing that @xmath22 is continuous provides that the integral of the derivative is exactly the change in @xmath22 .",
    "finally , knowing that @xmath73 and @xmath98 converge to 0 at @xmath95 , we may perform this integration from large enough @xmath11 to @xmath95 and write @xmath99 where the positive constant @xmath68 may be modified from line to line .",
    "the goal in the remainder of the proof is to derive a contradiction by shifting small pieces of volume of @xmath16 from far away to places closer to the center .",
    "we would like to do this in a way that does not increase the perimeter of the isoperimetric region too dramatically .    on this note",
    ", there exists an @xmath100 such that for small positive @xmath63 there is an inflated verson of @xmath16 , @xmath101 , that agrees with @xmath16 outside @xmath102 and has @xmath63 more weighted volume satisfying @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the constant generalized unaveraged mean curvature of @xmath105 with respect to densities @xmath7 and @xmath32 . to understand why this property of @xmath106 may hold , recall that @xmath104 is the derivative of @xmath7-weighted perimeter with respect to increases of @xmath32-weighted volume .",
    "so , there is a small number @xmath107 such that @xmath108 implies @xmath109 where @xmath110 is understood as the increase in @xmath7 weighted perimeter of @xmath16 from adding @xmath32 weighted volume @xmath63 to @xmath16 somewhere relatively close to the origin .",
    "because @xmath22 and @xmath32 are continuous functions , the intermediate value theorem gives the existence of @xmath100 such that @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 denote the restriction of @xmath106 to the ball @xmath113",
    ". then @xmath114 .",
    "fixing @xmath3 large enough , we have by ,      since @xmath16 is an isoperimetric region , @xmath116 , as they enclose the same volume , and becomes @xmath117 recall that @xmath63 is determined by @xmath3 and can be made arbitrarily small by making @xmath3 arbitrarily large . for @xmath63",
    "very small , the linear term is dwarfed by the power term .",
    "hence , for any @xmath3 large enough , @xmath118 this last estimate gives a contradiction with the assumption @xmath119 for all @xmath11 , and the proof is complete .",
    "now that we know by propositions [ existnball ] and [ noboundary ] that isoperimetric regions exist and are bounded , we can apply the local analysis in chambers to conclude they are balls about the origin .",
    "consider @xmath0 with smooth , radial , log convex volume density @xmath1 and perimeter density @xmath2 where @xmath3 is distance from the origin .",
    "then spheres about the origin are uniquely isoperimetric .    by proposition [ equiv ]",
    ", we may reduce the problem to the open unit euclidean ball with volume and perimeter density @xmath120 . by lemma [ convex ] , this is a log convex density on the open unit ball . because there is infinite weighted distance to the boundary , proposition [ existnball ] guarantees that isoperimetric regions exist .",
    "these isoperimetric regions are bounded by proposition [ noboundary ] .    because this isoperimetric region is bounded in a subset of @xmath5 with smooth , log convex , radial density",
    ", we may apply the same local analysis done by chambers [ ch ] on isoperimetric regions in @xmath5 . from this",
    ", we conclude that spheres about the origin are isoperimetric , uniquely because the density is strictly log convex .",
    "the proof of our main theorem [ weakhyperbolic ] compared hyperbolic space with perimeter density much larger than volume density to euclidean space with equal densities . since the log convex density conjecture for @xmath0 involves equal densities , the comparison would be with the euclidean ball with perimeter density much smaller than volume density , about which little is known ."
