    "homogenization represents a mathematical method actively used in high impact interdisciplinary research .",
    "there are hundreds of related publications , even the list of recently published monographs contains about twenty titles , including @xcite .",
    "this literature shows that the using of homogenization theory often requires rather advanced mathematical techniques , such as functional analysis , etc .",
    "the aim of this note is to give a simplest possible ` crash ' introduction to the method of homogenization by showing how it works for the description of waves in an elastic medium with periodically changing properties .",
    "the exposition follows to systematic and justifiable procedure that was introduced in vibrodynamics , see @xcite .",
    "the results include the deriving of equation for an averaged part of solution and an explicit formula for its oscillating part . as a result , the equation for the averaged solution appears as the wave equation with an effective coefficient of elasticity , which is a well - known and classical result .",
    "transparency , generality , and simplicity are the main benefits of our approach .",
    "we consider one - dimensional elastic medium with the density and elasticity properties periodically changing in the @xmath0-direction . the wave equation for a longitudinal displacement @xmath1",
    "is written in the dimensional form as @xmath2 where @xmath3 - time , subscripts stand for partial derivatives , @xmath4 ",
    "yong s modulus , @xmath5  mass per unit length , @xmath6  period in @xmath0 . for functions",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 we take @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are constants , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are @xmath14-periodic in @xmath0 functions with zero average . for example , @xmath15 with constants @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless variables and parameters ( marked with ` dags ' ) as follows : @xmath17 the dimensionless form of is ( the ` dags ' are dropped ) : @xmath18 we accept that @xmath19 is a small parameter @xmath20 , which means that we consider the large - scale solutions ( of characteristic scale @xmath21 ) .",
    "to solve ( [ wave - eqn - dless ] ) we introduce _ two mutually dependent _ spatial variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 and the form of the unknown function which depends on both variables @xmath25 with the use of the chain rule @xmath26 the equation takes the form @xmath27+\\varepsilon^2[(e{b}_r)_r-\\rho{b}_{tt}]=0\\ ] ] the key ` multi - scale ' or ` two - scale ' assumption is : @xmath28    hence we are looking for solutions @xmath29 of the pde with three independent variables",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we express the solutions to as regular series @xmath30 for performing of asymptotic procedure we assume that all dimensionless function @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( say , denoted as @xmath33 ) has the following properties :    @xmath34 @xmath35 and all its @xmath22- , @xmath23- , and @xmath3-derivatives are also @xmath36 ;    @xmath34 @xmath33 is @xmath37-periodic in @xmath22 , _ i.e. _  @xmath38 ;",
    "@xmath34 @xmath33 has an average given by @xmath39    @xmath34 @xmath33 can be split into the average and purely oscillating parts @xmath40 where _ tilde - functions _ ( or purely oscillating functions ) are such that @xmath41 and the _ bar - functions _ ( or averaged functions ) @xmath42 are @xmath22-independent .",
    "let us describe the procedure of solving , for the first three successive approximations :    * _ the equation of order @xmath43 is _ * @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary function , which appears after integration over @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite as @xmath46 its bar - part is @xmath47 , which immediately yields @xmath48 . then gives @xmath49 with unknown function @xmath50 .",
    "surprisingly , the solution in main approximation is not oscillating .    * _ the equation of order @xmath51 is _ * @xmath52 the use of simplifies it to the form @xmath53 which after integration gives @xmath54 with an arbitrary function @xmath55 .",
    "its bar - part yields @xmath56 , then the tilde - part of leads to @xmath57 this formula is the only result obtainable from the equation of the first approximation .    * _ the equation of order @xmath58 is _ * @xmath59 its bar - part is @xmath60 which jointly with leads to : @xmath61_r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the substitution @xmath62 , @xmath63 yields @xmath64 and the final form of is @xmath65 where the calculation of average @xmath66 represents the integration over @xmath22 .    hence , we have derived the wave equation for the solution in the main approximation , with an effective young s module @xmath67 .",
    "one can notice , that we havent used any assumption for the smallness of oscillation parts in the given functions @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "similar results represent the main and typical outcomes of all homogenization approaches .",
    "one can also notice , that in addition to the equation for the averaged part @xmath68 of the solution we have also obtained the explicit formula for its oscillating part @xmath69 .",
    "in all the above consideration we have exploited only the @xmath0-derivatives in the equation , and have left the time derivative in its original form .",
    "hence , it is possible to consider any other equation ( pde ) containing the same @xmath0-derivatives ( and different time - derivatives ) applying the same two - scale procedure as above , to have the same outcome for the ` spatial ' part of the equation . the best example to demonstrate",
    "this statement is to consider the diffusion equation @xmath70 where @xmath71  is a passive admixture or temperature , @xmath72 is constant , @xmath73  the diffusion coefficient which is assumed to be a periodic function @xmath74 .",
    "the procedure is identical to the given above and the expression for the effective diffusion coefficient is similar to @xmath75 in .",
    "hence , the averaged diffusion equation is : @xmath76 interesting examples showing that the exposed method is highly efficient and useful can be easily continued .",
