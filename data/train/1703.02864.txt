    "parton density functions ( pdfs ) are important fundamental quantities describing our current knowledge of ( primarily longitudinal ) momentum distributions of quarks and gluons in protons ( @xmath1 ) and nuclei ( @xmath2 ) . as intrinsically non - perturbative quantities , they are usually extracted by fitting perturbatively calculated cross sections , in particular of inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) in @xmath3 or @xmath4 collisions and the drell - yan ( dy ) process in @xmath5 or @xmath6 collisions , to experimental data .",
    "the predictive power of this procedure lies in the universality , i.e.  the process - independence of the pdfs guaranteed by the qcd factorization theorem @xcite and their perturbative evolution with the resolution scale @xmath7 , which is typically the virtuality of the exchanged vector boson . for proton pdfs",
    ", the desy hera @xmath3 collider delivered an unprecedented wealth of data , which now allows for precise theoretical predictions of cern lhc cross sections , required notably for the searches for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "in contrast , nuclear pdfs lag considerably behind .",
    "dis ( and dy ) data so far only exist in fixed - target kinematics , which considerably restricts their range in bjorken-@xmath0 and @xmath7 , and only with limited statistics for various nuclei ( typically he , c , ca , fe , w , au and pb ) , often as ratios to @xmath8d or @xmath5 data .",
    "a future electron ion collider ( eic ) would therefore have a strong impact , in particular on understanding the small- and large-@xmath0 regions of nuclear shadowing and the emc effect , respectively , and on pinning down the poorly restricted gluon densities in nuclei , as laid out in detail in the eic white paper @xcite and also discussed at the recent poetic 7 conference @xcite .",
    "current analyses of nuclear pdfs like dssz @xcite and ncteq15 @xcite have mostly relied on inclusive pion data from bnl rhic to restrict the nuclear gluon pdf with the disadvantage that these data depend also on the pion fragmentation function , which may furthermore be modified by medium effects @xcite .",
    "the importance of nuclear pdfs thus also lies in the fact that their knowledge is mandatory for a clean separation of cold and hot nuclear effects in the determination of the properties of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "in addition to inclusive pion data in d - au collisions at bnl rhic , the epps16 update to the eps09 analysis uses also lhc @xmath1-pb data on inclusive dijet production @xcite , while the update of the hkn07 analysis has focused on neutrino data @xcite and the question of universality of neutral and charged current dis @xcite .",
    "vector boson and ( slightly virtual ) photon production have also been suggested @xcite and employed @xcite as possible improvements .    in this paper , we study the impact of inclusive jet measurements in dis at a future eic on the determination of nuclear pdfs .",
    "in contrast to inclusive dis , jet production is not dominated by quark scattering , but also sensitive to gluon - initiated processes . at the same time , only cold nuclear effects are measured in ( pointlike ) electron - ion collisions in contrast to @xmath9 collisions and possibly even @xmath6 collsions , where collective effects are currently hotly debated @xcite .",
    "our calculations are based on previous work on jet production in photoproduction @xcite and dis @xcite at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , which we have recently systematically improved in both cases to approximate next - to - next - to - leading order ( annlo ) with a unified approach to soft and virtual corrections @xcite .",
    "note that very recently also full nnlo calculations of inclusive jet @xcite and dijet production @xcite in dis have become available , which show that the nnlo corrections are moderate in size , except at the kinematical edges , and that their inclusion leads to a substantial reduction of the scale variation uncertainty on the predictions .",
    "we emphasize again that our focus here is not the impact of higher - order corrections in @xmath3 collisions , but rather the sensitivity of this process to nuclear effects in @xmath8a collisions at the eic .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we describe our theoretical setup , including in particular our choices of renormalization and factorization scales and pdf sets . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we review the proposed experimental conditions for the two possible eic designs and their detectors , i.e.   bnl s proposal to add an electron ring to the existing relativistic heavy ion collider ( erhic ) and jefferson laboratory s proposal to build a medium energy electron ion collider ( meic ) or jefferson laboratory eic ( jleic ) using the upgraded 12 gev continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) .",

    ", the experimental information on the partonic structure of heavy nuclei would soon rival that of protons obtained at desy hera . in the following section",
    ", we will provide numerical results for each of the three accelerator designs mentioned above .",
    "note that upgrade options exist for both sites , which may allow to also reach beam energies of up to @xmath30 gev per nucleon with the jefferson laboratory eic ( jleic ) @xcite and annual luminosities of up to 100 fb@xmath33 with erhic at bnl @xcite .    for both sites , similar detector requirements have been specified .",
    "they aim at a kinematic coverage of @xmath46 1 gev@xmath44 and 0.01 @xmath47 0.95 by using either the scattered electron or the hadronic final state with the jacquet - blondel method , which has proven advantageous at very low values of @xmath48 at desy hera .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter would span the rapidity range @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "no specifications have so far been fixed for the hadronic calorimeter , so that we assume the same coverage . at desy hera ,",
    "jets have been reconstructed in the breit frame down to transverse momenta of @xmath50 gev @xcite , which we assume to be also possible at a future eic .",
    "we now turn to our numerical results for inclusive jet production at the eic .",
    "first , we investigate the dependence of various differential cross sections on the eic beam energies .",
    "next , we quantify the size of nlo and annlo corrections to the lo cross sections .",
    "third , we study the dependence of the cross sections on the type of the colliding nucleus .",
    "finally , our main results concern a demonstration of the current nuclear pdf uncertainty on the inclusive jet cross sections and the impact that a future eic might have on their reduction .      in the following , we shall always display four typical differential cross sections for inclusive jet production in dis , i.e.  the distributions in the jet transverse momentum @xmath26 in the breit frame and in the rapidity @xmath51 in the lab frame , with the positive @xmath52-axis pointing in the direction of the ion beam , as well as the dis variables @xmath7 and bjorken-@xmath0 .",
    "these four differential cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for @xmath8-pb    collisions and three different eic designs : the rhic ion beam with a nominal beam energy per nucleon of 100 gev colliding with new electron beams of 16 gev ( full black lines ) and 21 gev ( dotted green lines ) , respectively , and the cebaf electron beam of 12 gev energy colliding with a new ion beam of 40 gev energy per nucleon ( dashed blue lines ) .    at first sight",
    ", the @xmath26-range ( top left ) seems to be considerably larger in the erhic designs , where it extends to 35 gev compared to only 1520 gev at the meic .",
    "the different nominal luminosities of 10 and 100 fb@xmath33 lead , however , to a comparable number of about 100 events at 15@xmath53 gev with only about 1 event surviving in a 2030 gev bin . for the detector acceptance",
    ", we have assumed that the hadronic calorimeter covers the rapidity range @xmath49 .",
    "the rapidity distribution in the lab frame ( top right ) shows , however , that the majority of the events is contained in the smaller range @xmath54 at erhic and @xmath55 at meic .",
    "similarly to the case of inclusive dis ( cf .  again fig .",
    "1.5 of ref.@xcite ) , the range in @xmath7 would be extended in inclusive jet production to @xmath45 gev@xmath44 at meic and beyond at erhic ( bottom left ) , while the range in bjorken-@xmath0 extends to @xmath56 and below ( bottom right ) . for this last distribution , which is perhaps the most interesting for the determination of nuclear pdfs ,",
    "the advantage of the erhic designs with their considerably higher center - of - mass energies over the meic design is perhaps most notable .",
    "for all four distributions , the gain in reach from a 16 to a 21 gev electron beam at erhic is , however , not very large and would probably be compensated by the loss in luminosity .      having established the experimental reaches in the relevant kinematic distributions , we now turn to the more theoretical aspect of the impact of higher - order corrections . generally , the k - factors , i.e.  the ratios of the nlo or annlo cross sections to those at lo , are not constant , but depend on the kinematic variables of the studied process , in particular those that set the perturbative scales entering the strong coupling and pdfs .",
    "large corrections are expected at low scales and when the coupling or pdfs are large , and vice versa .",
    "this expectation is clearly confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where we show    the k - factors for the same four differential cross sections as before , but now only for one erhic design with a 16 gev electron beam and a 100 gev lead - ion beam . in the @xmath26-distribution ( upper left ) and",
    "the @xmath7-distribution ( lower left ) , the nlo corrections reach a factor of 22.5 at low @xmath50 gev and @xmath57 gev@xmath44 .",
    "these are the two kinematic variables that enter the renormalization scale @xmath58 , while @xmath7 alone sets the factorization scale @xmath59 , cf .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding cuts also set the scale in the rapidity distribution ( upper right ) , where the k - factor rises above 2 at forward rapidities due to the high gluon density in this small-@xmath0 regime .",
    "the same rise is therefore seen in the bjorken-@xmath0 distribution ( lower right ) at very low values of @xmath0 . since , for constant electron energy transfer , @xmath0 scales directly with @xmath7 , the k - factors fall in both distributions towards higher values of these variables .",
    "substantial k - factors ( e.g.  larger than 2 ) usually give rise to doubts about the stability of the perturbative calculation . often , they can , however , be explained by the opening - up of additional partonic channels . here",
    ", this is in particular the case for the splitting of low-@xmath0 gluons into quark - antiquark pairs which then scatter off the virtual photon . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the stability of the perturbative calculation is also established by the fact that the annlo k - factors ( dot - dashed red lines ) corrections are very similar to those at nlo ( full black lines ) .",
    "this confirms the observation in the exact nnlo calculations that the nnlo corrections are moderate in size , but lead to a stabilization of the cross sections with respect to variations of the renormalization and factorization scales ( see above ) @xcite .",
    "the main goal of our work is to demonstrate the sensitivity of an eic to nuclear pdf effects and to establish which regions ( shadowing , antishadowing , emc suppression , fermi motion ) could be constrained there .",
    "we therefore show in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ratios of nuclear over bare proton cross sections ,    differential in the same kinematic variables as before , for typical light and heavy nuclei : he-4 ( dot - dashed red lines ) , c-12 ( dotted green lines ) , fe-56 ( dashed blue lines ) , and pb-208 ( full black lines ) . the eic design is the same as before , i.e.  an erhic machine with electron and ion beam energies ( per nucleon ) of 16 and 100 gev , respectively",
    ".    significant reductions of 20% and more are seen at large @xmath26 and @xmath7 , very forward rapidities and both small and large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the region of small @xmath60 with particularly high gluon and sea quark densities , corresponding to very forward rapidities , is known to be sensitive to nuclear shadowing induced by rescattering @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting model of nuclear shadowing is the leading - twist approach @xcite , which is based on the relationship between nuclear shadowing and diffraction on a nucleon and which can be tested , among other processes , in ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the shadowing effect is known to decrease with the mass number of the nucleus @xcite , and this is also clearly observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . from pb-208 to fe-56 , c-12 , and he-4 , the effect is reduced from 22% to about 12 , 6 and 3% at @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "reductions of up to 35% are seen in the large-@xmath0 regime of the emc suppression , which is usually attributed to non - perturbative qcd effects on the valence quark distributions such as multiquark clusters , dynamical rescaling , or nuclear binding , but for which a theoretical consensus is still missing @xcite .",
    "also this reduction decreases with the nuclear mass number , although less rapidly , i.e.  from 35% for pb-208 and fe-56 to 25% for c-12 and 20% for he-4 .    enhancements of up to 10% are observed at low @xmath26 and low and medium @xmath7 as well as central rapidities and intermediate values of @xmath62 .",
    "this so - called anti - shadowing region is not only required by momentum - conservation , but can also be explained with constructive interference of multiple scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "it thus is expected to be theoretically connected to the shadowing region , and the nuclear mass dependence is indeed very similar . since the experimental uncertainty on determinations of nuclear pdfs at the eic",
    "is expected to be dominated by a 2% systematic error ( black error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , and not by statistics ( cf .",
    "fig .  3.25 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , even effects of this size should be measurable at the eic .",
    "the question is now what impact the eic can have on a reduction of the nuclear pdf uncertainties compared to our current knowledge from fixed - target dis and dy experiments . to this end",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the same    central predictions as in the previous section of the ncteq15 fit to these data for pb-208 ( full black lines ) , but supplement it now with the envelope of the corresponding set of 32 error pdfs ( red - shaded bands ) determined with the hessian method @xcite .",
    "the latter relies on the assumption that , near its minimum , the @xmath63-function can be approximated by a quadratic form of the fitting parameters involving a matrix of second - order partial derivatives with respect to the parameter shifts from the minimum , which must then be diagonalized .",
    "we are particularly interested in the gluon contribution , which suffers from the largest uncertainties @xcite and whose relative contribution to the differential cross sections is therefore shown in addition ( dashed blue lines ) .",
    "what we observe at large rapidities ( top right ) and even more at small values of @xmath0 ( bottom right ) is that the gluon contributes substantially there ( up to 70% ) and that the nuclear pdf uncertainty reaches values of @xmath64% . in these regions ,",
    "the eic would therefore have the greatest impact and might eventually lead to a reduction of the uncertainty by an order of magnitude ( black error bars ) .",
    "a similar reduction of the gluon uncertainty has been estimated to be possible in inclusive dis and charm production at an eic with 20 gev electrons and 100 gev gold ions @xcite or at an lhec @xcite .",
    "the complementary regions , in particular the valence - quark dominated region at medium - large @xmath0 , have considerably smaller uncertainties of about @xmath65% , which would , however , still be reduced with an eic by a factor of five .",
    "if one integrates over the rapidity , as has been done in the @xmath26 ( top left ) and @xmath7 ( bottom left ) distributions , the uncertainty in the gluon - dominated regions at low values of @xmath26 and @xmath7 shrinks considerably , as one averages over large regions of @xmath0 . at large @xmath26 and @xmath7 , however , one probes also large values of @xmath0 , which can be estimated by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . at very large @xmath0 , information on nuclear pdfs is again very poor , as this region is difficult to reach in fixed - target collisions , so that the nuclear pdf uncertainty rises there to values of + 30/@xmath6810% .    in our last figure ,",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we repeat the same study as before ,    but include now also inclusive pion data from bnl rhic in the ncteq15 estimate of the nuclear pdf uncertainty . as we mentioned before , this additional information depends on theoretical assumptions about the fragmentation function of quarks and gluons into pions . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] reveals that this additional information reduces the uncertainty by about a third , in particular at large rapidity and low bjorken-@xmath0 , but also at large @xmath26 and @xmath7 , but that even under this additional assumption there is still large room for improvement from the eic ( black error bars ) .",
    "it is interesting to confront the full ncteq15 fit using the inclusive pion data from d - au collisions at bnl rhic ( full black lines and red - shaded bands ) with another , even more recent npdf analysis , epps16 @xcite , which also includes these data , but in addition uses cern lhc data on @xmath69 and @xmath70 production and , more importantly , dijet production in @xmath1-pb collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 5.02 tev @xcite .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ fig:5 ] the central epps16 predictions are also shown ( dotted green lines ) , together with the envelope of the corresponding set of 40 error pdfs ( green - shaded bands ) , determined again with the hessian method .",
    "overall , one observes that the shapes of the cross section ratios in the four distributions differ somewhat , in particular at the kinematic edges . while at low @xmath26 ( top left ) ncteq15 and epps16 make very similar predictions , at high @xmath26 epps16 predict about half the suppresion from ncteq15 with an uncertainty that is also about half as big",
    "this is not surprising , as the fitted cms dijet production data extend to jets of @xmath71 gev @xcite , which is much higher than the @xmath72 and 17 gev pions that were measured with phenix @xcite and star @xcite at bnl rhic , respectively .",
    "similarly , epps16 fitted to cms dijet data with rapidities up to @xmath73 , while the pion measurements by phenix and star extended only to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , so that differences at very forward rapidities are to be expected ( top right ) . the reduced uncertainty there translates into a similarly reduced uncertainty at low bjorken-@xmath0 ( bottom right ) , while in the @xmath7 distribution the ncteq15 and epps16 predictions are again very similar , except at very high scales ( bottom left ) .",
    "under the assumption that jets are not ( or at least less than pions ) modified in @xmath6 collisions , the epps16 predictions are already quite precise , but would still be improved at an eic by a factor of up to five .",
    "let us therefore now come to our conclusions . in this paper , we have made predictions for inclusive jet production in electron - ion collisions at a possible future eic .",
    "our goal was in particular to establish the benefit that such a collider might have on a more precise determination of nuclear pdfs , which is not only required to enhance our knowledge of quark and gluon dynamics in the nucleus , but also to allow for a reliable extraction of hot nuclear matter properties after a proper subtraction of cold nuclear effects .",
    "theoretically , our calculations were based on a full nlo and an approximate nnlo calculation , implemented in the program jetvip .",
    "while the nlo corrections were large , in particular at low perturbative scales , perturbative stability was restored at annlo in line with expectations from full nnlo calculations .",
    "phenomenologically , we have established that measurements of inclusive jet production at an eic would extend the kinematic ranges to @xmath76 gev@xmath44 and @xmath42 similarly to inclusive dis and allow to reduce the uncertainty on nuclear pdfs , in particular the one of the gluon at low @xmath0 , by factors of five to ten .",
    "this improvement would probably not be possible in inclusive dis alone , but would alternatively require additional charm tagging possibilities .",
    "future calculations could properly include jet mass effects in the annlo calculation @xcite , although as we have seen the impact of these corrections is small , and extend the present study to dijet production , which would allow for more complete kinematic constraints .",
    "more differential studies of single , two and three jets and their shapes at the eic might help to establish if they are modified in @xmath4 collisions compared to @xmath3 collisions , similarly to the modification of the pion fragmentation function in @xmath9 collisions and possible collective effects in @xmath6 collisions .",
    "it would then become possible to investigate transport properties of the cold nuclear medium and test the strong gluon field paradigm @xcite .",
    "finally , even transverse - momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) of gluons in protons and nuclei might become accessible in measurements of dijet asymmetries in polarized or unpolarized @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the potential of inclusive - jet production in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) at a future electron - ion collider ( eic ) to improve our current knowledge of nuclear parton density functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the kinematic reach is extended similarly to inclusive dis , but that the uncertainty of the nuclear pdfs , in particular of the gluon density at low bjorken-@xmath0 , is considerably reduced , by up to an order of magnitude compared to the present situation . using an approximate next - to - next - to - leading order ( annlo ) calculation implemented in the program jetvip </S>",
    "<S> , we also make predictions for three different eic designs and for four different light and heavy nuclei . </S>"
