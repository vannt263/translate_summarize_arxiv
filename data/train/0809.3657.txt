    "have taken very different approaches to describe the cloud formation and the cloud properties of substellar objects as a function of gravity , effective temperature , and metallicity . here",
    "we make a first attempt to compare the quantitative predictions of these various approaches in order to better understand the models themselves as well as the uncertainty which remains in application of these models to real objects .",
    "atmospheric physics classically involves hydrodynamics , radiative and convective energy transport , and gas phase chemistry .",
    "effects of magnetic fields are neglected .",
    "ideally , the only free parameters are the effective temperature t@xmath1 , the surface gravity @xmath5 , radius r@xmath6 or mass m@xmath6 , and element abundances @xmath7 . in order to solve such a coupled system of equations in a computationally reasonable time , assumptions like the hydrostatic equilibrium , mixing length theory and chemical equilibrium",
    "are made . inside substellar atmospheres , chemical equilibrium of the gas phase",
    "is justified due to high collision rates between gas - phase constituents .",
    "irradiation or atmospheric flows may invalidate this assumption in the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "the validity of hydrostatic equilibrium and mixing length theory have been studied in comparison to large eddy simulations for m - type stars ( ludwig et al.2002 , 2006 ) and we know from the direct observation of solar system giant planets at low gravities and effective temperatures that hydrostatic equilibrium is an appropriate down to very low pressures ( @xmath8 ) in the atmosphere .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium coupled with the mixing length theory is computationally extremely efficient and an accurate approximation in particular if one is aiming at synthetic spectrum calculations .",
    "the striking difference of substellar atmosphere models compared to the classical stellar approach is the necessity to model the formation of clouds and their feedback onto the entire atmosphere .",

    "see also ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) for a review and comparison of the earlier cloud literature .",
    "the overall , phenomenological understanding of cloud formation in substellar objects has converged to the picture that dust ( or condensates , see table  [ t : distionary ] ) forms at a certain height in the atmosphere where it acts as an efficient element sink leaving behind a depleted gas phase .",
    "the departure of tio and feh spectral lines from the m to the l dwarfs testifies to this process .",
    "the dust then settles gravitationally taking condensed elements with it .",
    "convection and atmospheric mixing replenishes the condensing gas , resulting in a steady state .",
    "the details of this picture , however , leave room for debate .",
    "it is for example not clear where the dust precisely starts to form since this depends on the details of the model assumptions .",
    "current models generally employ one of two physical approaches to understand this process . in the first paradigm gas",
    "is mixed upward into higher altitudes .",
    "dust then forms , falls down and meanwhile grows until it evaporates below the cloud base ( woitke & helling 2003 ) .",
    "the second paradigm imagines the opposite limiting case in which the gas is well mixed from the deep atmosphere only up to a cloud base .",
    "grains and gas are transported above cloud base by mixing and grains fall down under the influence of gravity ( ackerman & marley 2001 , allard et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these two branches rely on fundamentally different model assumptions : ( i ) the phase - non - equilibrium concept of kinetic dust formation ( woitke & helling 2003 , 2004 ; helling & woitke 2006 , helling , woitke & thi 2008 ) , and ( ii ) the phase - equilibrium concept of thermal stability ( tsuji et al 1996b , tsuji 2005 , allard et al .",

    "this result is not surprising because the dehn  & hauschildt + helling  & woitke , the marley , ackerman & lodders and the tsuji@xmath22-models contain the highest amount of small dust particles in the upper cloud layers ( sect .",

    "additionally , the allard & homeier - model suggests more spectral flux in several wavelength intervals than the tsuji@xmath26-model with an extended cloud layer .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectotal1000 ] also demonstrates an appreciable difference of the tsuji - models around @xmath27 m which are sensitive to the application of the jola opacity band model .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : spec05 - 3.0_1800 ] that the tsuji@xmath20 , the marley , ackerman & lodders - models and the dehn  & hauschildt + helling  & woitke - model produce much shallower absorption features in particular in the optical and near - ir then the tsuji@xmath22 and the allard & homeier - models .",
    "again , the reason lies in the differences in cloud modelling .",
    "this result appears surprising for the dehn  & hauschildt + helling  & woitke  model since more elements remain in the gas phase due to incomplete dust formation , hence , the absorption features should be deeper . a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : p2cloudstruc ] ( top panel ) resolves this : all models showing shallow absorption features are amongst the hottest @xmath28 structures , hence , have low densities at given atmospheric temperature and therefore lower opacity at that atmospheric height .",
    "note that the @xmath29-profiles are much more similar for t@xmath231000k and so is the depth of the absorption features .",
    "consequently , a spectral analysis relying on the depth of near- and ir spectral features , e.g. as gravity indicator , would underestimate the gravity in the case of the tsuji and the allard & homeier - models compared to the marley , ackerman & lodders and dehn  & hauschildt + helling  & woitke  models in the l - dwarf regime .",
    "+        it appears that the treatment of the gas - phase opacity can account for some differences in the synthetic spectral energy distribution , here in particular the treatment by the jola band method in the tsuji - models vs. the more frequency sensitive methods used in all other models .",
    "however , the completeness of the molecular line lists has only minor effects on our photometry results given the large influence of the dust modelling demonstrated here .",

    "the reason is the strong feedback of the clouds on the @xmath29-structure due to the clouds strong opacity and its high efficiency in depleting the gas of the atmosphere .",
    "viewing their spectral appearance , the results of the cloud model atmosphere codes appear to fall into two categories : +  the _ high - altitude cloud models _ or _ extended _ ( tsuji@xmath101 , marley , ackerman & lodders , dehn & hauschildt + helling & woitke ) where the dust - to - gas ratio peaks at high altitudes though at different absolute levels . in these models , small grains ( @xmath102 m ) are still present well above the maximum of @xmath103 , hence the gas - phase absorption is less deep for @xmath104 m . +  the _ low - altitude cloud models _ or _ thin _ ( tsuji@xmath20 , allard & homeier ) where the dust - to - gas ratio maximum sits further inside the atmosphere and no grains populate higher atmospheric layers above the maximum of @xmath103 .",
    "consequently , the gas - phase absorption features are much deeper in the mid - ir and ir part of the spectrum . consequently , the _ low - altitude cloud / thin _ model atmospheres appear bluer then the _ high - altitude cloud / extended _ model atmospheres .",
    "comparing synthetic photometric fluxes and colours from different model atmosphere codes illustrates the current range of uncertainty , or error bar , for theoretical predictions .",
    "these error bars are worst cases .",
    "they are derived from a group of different models and not from only one particular family of models . in the most conservative case ,",
    "the maximum differences in photometric fluxes , @xmath105 $ ] , amongst the models are between 1% and 30% .",
    "@xmath106 $ ] increases to 50% for the t - dwarf test case in the wfcam ukirt wavelength intervals .",
    "this translates into an uncertainty in apparent magnitudes for the l - dwarf test case of @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 increases to 1.375 for the t - dwarf test case in the wfcam ukirt filter system .",
    "we conclude that every comparison with observations should ideally involve models from different groups",
    ". this would allow the determination of a synthetic error bar in determinations of fundamental quantities like t@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and metallicity .",
    "ultimately comparison of models to objects with independently constrained properties ( from orbital motion and bolometric luminosity , for example ) will elucidate the modelling approaches that most accurately capture the relevant physics .",
    "other possibilities for tests include objects in young stellar clusters which have well constrained ages and metallicities .",
    "future works on cloud formation need to seek more support in laboratory astrophysics .",
    "hydrodynamic modelling of ultra - cool atmospheres will provide the opportunity to study the dynamic processes of cloud formation .",
    "they need to including a consistent description of the chemical formation processes and simultaneously address the challenge of a turbulent fluid field .",
