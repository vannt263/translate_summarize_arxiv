    "we observe that the same quantities computed with the barrett - crane spinfoam dynamics do not show the right behavior when the off - diagonal components of the metric operator are considered .    using the same technique we can evaluate the leading order of the two - point function .",
    "we have that @xmath332 the quantity we are specifically interested in in this paper is the _ connected _ two - point function .",

    "we collect some remarks on this result :    * the lqg propagator scales as @xmath355 , as expected for correlations of objects with dimensions of area square , @xmath356 . * the off - diagonal components are not suppressed",

    "the ` @xmath137-terms ' are parity violating .    in next section",
    "we investigate the relation of the result found with the graviton propagator computed in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "the motivation for studying the lqg propagator comes from the fact that it probes a regime of the theory where predictions can be compared to the ones obtained perturbatively in a quantum field theory of gravitons on flat space @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate this relation already at the preliminary level of a single spin foam vertex studied in this paper . in this section",

    "therefore we can ask if there is a choice of these @xmath4 parameters such that we can satisfy the @xmath385 independent equations given by the matching condition @xmath386 we find that a solution in terms of the parameters @xmath124 can be found only in the limit of vanishing immirzi parameter , keeping constant the product @xmath387 . in this limit",

    "in this paper we have studied correlation functions of metric operators in loop quantum gravity .",
    "the analysis presented involves two distinct ingredients :    * the first is a setting for defining correlation functions .",
    "the setting is the boundary amplitude formalism .",
    "it involves a boundary semiclassical state @xmath16 which identifies the regime of interest , loop quantum gravity operators @xmath391 which probe the quantum geometry on the boundary , a spin foam model @xmath10 which implements the dynamics .",
    "the formalism allows to define semiclassical correlation functions in a background - independent context . *",
    "the second ingredient consists in an approximation scheme applied to the quantity defined above .",
    "it involves a vertex expansion and a large spin expansion .",
    "it allows to estimate the correlation functions explicitly .",
    "the explicit result can then be compared to the graviton propagator of perturbative quantum gravity . in this paper we focused on the lowest order in the vertex expansion and the leading order in the large spin expansion .",
    "the results found in the paper can be summarized as follows :    * in section [ sec : boundary state ] we have introduced a semiclassical state @xmath16 peaked on the intrinsic and the extrinsic geometry of the boundary of a regular euclidean @xmath3-simplex .",
    "the technique used to build this state is the following : ( i ) we use the coherent intertwiners introduced in @xcite to define coherent spin networks as in @xcite ; ( ii ) we choose the normals labelling intertwiners so that they are compatible with a simplicial 3-geometry ( [ eq : continuity ] ) .",
    "this addresses the issue of discontinuous lengths identified in @xcite ; ( iii ) then we take a gaussian superposition over coherent spin networks in order to peak on extrinsic curvature as in @xcite .",
    "this state is an improvement of the ansatz used in @xcite , as it depends only on the three free parameters @xmath384 . * in section [ sec : integral formula ]",
    "we have defined expectation values of geometric observables on a semiclassical state .",
    "the lqg propagator is defined in equation ( [ eq : gnm ] ) as a connected correlation function for the product of two metric operators @xmath392 this is the object that in principle can be compared to the graviton propagator on flat space : the background is coded in the expectation value of the geometric operators and the propagator measures correlations of fluctuations over this background . * in section [ sec : integral2 ] we have introduced a technique which allows to write lqg metric operators as insertions in a @xmath232 group integral .",
    "it can be interpreted as the covariant version of the lqg operators .",
    "the formalism works for arbitrary fixed triangulation .",
    "having an integral formula for expectation values and correlations of metric operators allows to formulate the large spin expansion as a stationary phase approximation .",
    "the problem is studied in detail restricting attention to the lowest order in the vertex expansion , i.e. at the single - vertex level . *",
    "the analysis of the large spin asymptotics is performed in section [ sec : stationary phase ] .",
    "the technique used is the one introduced by barrett et al in @xcite .",
    "there , the large spin asymptotics of the boundary amplitude of a coherent spin network is studied and four distinct critical points are found to contribute to the asymptotics .",
    "two of them are related to different orientations of a @xmath3-simplex .",
    "the other two come from selfdual configurations . here",
    ", our boundary state is peaked also on extrinsic curvature .",
    "the feature of this boundary state is that it selects only one of the critical points , extracting @xmath393 from the asymptotics of the eprl spin foam vertex .",
    "this is a realization of the mechanism first identified by rovelli in @xcite for the barrett - crane model . * in [ sec : expectation values ] we compute expectation values of lqg metric operators at leading order and find that they reproduce the intrinsic geometry of the boundary of a regular @xmath3-simplex .",
    "* computing correlations of geometric operators requires going beyond the leading order in the large spin expansion . in section",

    "the regge term coincides with the correlations of areas and angles computed in regge calculus with a boundary state @xcite .",
    "it comes from correlations of fluctuations of the spin variables and depends on the parameters @xmath124 of the boundary state .",
    "the `` @xmath137-term '' comes from fluctuations of the @xmath232 group variables .",
    "an explicit algebraic calculation of the tensorial components of the lqg propagator is presented . *",

    "the three parameters @xmath124 appearing in the semiclassical boundary state can be chosen so that the tensorial structure of the lqg propagator matches with the one of the graviton propagator .",
    "the matching is obtained in the limit @xmath358 with @xmath382 fixed .",
    "now we would like to put these results in perspective with respect to the problem of extracting the low energy regime of loop quantum gravity and spin foams ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "deriving the lqg propagator at the level of a single spin foam vertex is certainly only a first step . within the setting of a vertex expansion",
    ", an analysis of the lqg propagator for a finite number of spinfoam vertices is needed .",
    "some of the techniques developed in this paper generalize to this more general case .",
    "in particular superpositions of coherent spin networks can be used to build semiclassical states peaked on the intrinsic and the extrinsic curvature of an arbitrary boundary regge geometry .",
    "moreover , the expression of the lqg metric operator in terms of @xmath232 group integrals presented in this paper works for an arbitrary number of spin foam vertices and allows to derive an integral representation of the lqg propagator in the general case , analogous to the one of @xcite but with non - trivial insertions .",
    "this representation is the appropriate one for the analysis of the large spin asymptotics along the lines discussed for regge calculus in @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial question which needs to be answered then is if the semiclassical boundary state is able to enforce semiclassicality in the bulk .",
    "another feature identified in this paper which appears to be general is that , besides the expected regge contribution , correlations of lqg metric operators have a non - regge contribution which is proper of the spin foam model .",
