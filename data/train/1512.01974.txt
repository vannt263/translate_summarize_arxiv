    "thermal fluctuations can induce spontaneous transitions and , therefore , affect the stability of optic states in chlc .",
    "the preparation of a chlc system in a particular state can be destroyed by thermally activated transitions to other available states .",
    "typically , p and fc structures are very stable against thermal fluctuations due to the large energy barrier separating the states  @xcite .",

    "thermally assisted switching between p and fc states has already been proposed for recording visual data in chlc devices  @xcite .    in this article , we study transitions between stable states in chlc by analyzing the multidimensional energy surface of the system defined by the oseen - frank model  @xcite .",

    "the d configuration emerges at @xmath68 mv as a metastable state .",
    "the energy of d state decreases faster with the voltage as compared to that of p state and at @xmath69 mv the energy levels of both states coincide .",
    "if the voltage further increases , the d state becomes energetically favorable . at @xmath70 mv",
    ", the p state becomes unstable .",
    "chlc in the external magnetic field shows similar behaviour and becomes bistable in the magnetic field range @xmath71 , where @xmath72 gs , @xmath73 gs , @xmath74 gs ( see fig .  [ fig_2](b ) ) .",
    "the chlc initially prepared in the p state can be transferred to the d state by increasing the applied voltage ( magnetic field ) .",

    "inverse transition form d to p occurs at @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , temperature renormalizes transition fields : thermal fluctuations can induce spontaneous transitions even when the barrier is not zero . specifically , transition field at a given temperature is the magnitude of the external field at which the time scale of thermally activated transitions from p ( d ) state to d ( p ) state , @xmath79 , becomes equal to the time scale of the experiment , @xmath80 .",
    "the thermal lifetime @xmath79 can be estimated using the harmonic rate theory  @xcite which predicts the arrhenius dependence on the temperature : @xmath81 where the pre - exponential factor @xmath82 is expected to weakly depend on the field and the energy barrier @xmath83 given by the energy difference between the local energy minimum and the first order saddle point ( sp ) is strongly field - dependent ( see below ) .",
    "is an implicit definition of the transition fields in chlc at a finite temperature .",
    "study of the effect of thermal fluctuations on the transitions in chlc essentially becomes a problem of identifying the sps on the energy surface .",
    "the first order sp is a stationary point on the energy surface which is a maximum with respect to one and only one degree of freedom , but a minimum with respect to the other degrees of freedom .",
    "one approach for locating sps is based on finding minimum energy paths ( meps ) between given stable states , because maximum on the mep is a sp on the energy surface .",
    "this approach is used here to study activation energy barriers for the transitions in chlc .    before we proceed with the analysis of meps and sps on the multidimensional energy surface of a chlc , we present a reduced , two - dimensional model of a chlc with rigid boundary conditions in a magnetic field , where stable states , sps and meps can be visualized easily giving a valuable insight into the mechanism of transitions in chlc .",
    "fourier components of the spherical coordinates @xmath84 , @xmath7 can be used to define the energy surface of a chlc .",
    "the dimensionality of the energy surface is then defined by the number of fourier components taken into account in the analysis . in the simplest approximation , when only one fourier harmonic is taken for @xmath84 and for @xmath7 , the energy surface is two - dimensional and , therefore , can be visualized . in this case following functional form for the spherical coordinates may be used : @xmath85    a contour graph of the energy surface can be constructed by substituting @xmath84 and @xmath7 from eqs .   and   into the expression for the energy of the system , eq .  .",
    "the resulting enegy surface is obtained for two values of the magnetic field , @xmath86 gs and @xmath87 gs . the structure of the energy surface depends on the magnitude of the external field . when @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) ) , there is only one minimum on the energy surface ( @xmath89 ) which corresponds to p state . at larger fields ( @xmath90 ) , two equivalent stable d states",
    "appear in the system , while the p state is also present ( see fig .  [ fig_1](b ) ) .",

    "( b ) @xmath90 .",
    "mep is shown with a white curve while sps are indicated with yellow crosses . ]",
    "although the two - dimensional model of chlc reveals the main characteristics of transitions between the stable states , the quantitative analysis of energy barriers requires calculations of stable states , meps and sps for the full , multidimensional model .",
    "locating the sps on multidimensional energy surfaces is significantly more difficult than finding the minima .",
    "the difficulty arises from the need to minimize the energy with respect to all but one degree of freedom for which a maximization should be carried out .",
    "the problem is that it is not known a priori which degree of freedom should be treated differently . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe an efficient approach based on calculation of meps .",
    "an mep between two minima is the path in the configuration space which lies lowermost on the energy surface . in the case of fredericksz transition in chlc , following a mep means rotating the director of each element of the chlc in such a way that the energy is minimal with respect to all degrees of freedom perpendicular to the path .",
    "a maximum along a mep corresponds to a first order saddle point on the energy surface , and the highest maximum gives an estimate of the activation energy barrier .",
    "the mep not only gives the position of sp , but also provides information about mechanism of the transition , as it represents the path of highest statistical weight .",
    "special attention needs to be taken when calculating meps for the transitions in chlc , because of the curvature of the configuration space arising from the constraint on the length of the director , @xmath92 .",
    "namely , configuration space of an chlc divided into @xmath34 elements is a @xmath39-dimensional riemannian manifold , @xmath93 , corresponding to the direct product of @xmath34 2-dimensional spheres : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a @xmath96-dimensional unit sphere associated with the director of the @xmath97-th element .",
    "similar problem arises when studying transitions in magnetic systems , where a constraint is usually applied on the length of magnetic moments .",
    "recently , the geodesic nudged elastic band ( gneb ) method has been formulated to find meps in curved manifolds such as @xmath93 and applied to transitions in magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "similar to the original nudged elastic band ( neb ) method  @xcite widely used to study thermally induced atomic rearrangements , the gneb method involves taking some initial guess of a path between the two minima , and systematically bringing that to the nearest mep . a path is represented by a discrete chain of states , or images , of the system , where the first and the last image are placed at the energy minima corresponding to the stable configurations . in order to distribute the images evenly along the path , springs are introduced between adjacent images . at each image , a local tangent to the path needs to be estimated and the force guiding the images towards the nearest mep is defined as the sum of the transverse component of the negative energy gradient plus the component of the spring force along the tangent .",
    "the position of intermediate images is then adjusted so as to zero the gneb force .",
    "an important aspect of the method is that both the gneb force and the path tangent are defined in the local tangent space of the @xmath93 manifold , which is needed to satisfy the constraint on the length of the director and to properly decouple the perpendicular component of the energy gradient from the spring force  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the gneb method applied to chlc in a planar cell is as follows .",
    "a chain of @xmath98 images is constructed , @xmath99 $ ] , where the endpoints are fixed and given by the local minima corresponding to p and d configurations in the chlc , while the @xmath100 intermediate images @xmath101 , @xmath102 , give a discrete representation of a path .",
    "the position of the intermediate images is adjusted in order to converge on the mep .",
    "this is accomplished by systematically displacing the images in the direction defined by the gneb force acting on them so as to zero this force .",
    "the gneb forces @xmath103 guiding the images towards the mep are defined as follows : @xmath104 here the subscript @xmath105 denotes projection of a vector on the local tangent space of @xmath93 .",
    "the perpendicular component of the energy gradient is obtained by subtracting out the parallel component @xmath106 where the unit tangent to the path , @xmath107 , lies in the tangent space , which is indicated by the subscript @xmath105 .",
    "the parallel component of the spring force is evaluated as @xmath108\\hat{\\bm{\\tau}}^\\nu_\\mathcal{t}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are geodesic distances between images @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 , respectively , and @xmath114 is a spring constant . since the spring force is decoupled from the perpendicular component of the energy gradient , the value of the spring constant is not critical and , in fact , can be varied over several orders of magnitude without affecting the calculation results  @xcite .",
    "some minimization method needs to be used in connection with the gneb method so as to zero the forces @xmath103 .",
    "we used the velocity projection optimization ( vpo ) algorithm based on a fictitious equation of motion of a point mass on a curved manifold @xmath93 where the velocity is damped by including only the component in the direction of the force  @xcite .",
    "once convergence has been reached , the images lie on the mep where the energy gradient @xmath115 can only have a component in the direction of the path .",
    "the activation energy and the sp configuration can then be derived from the maximum along the mep .",
    "the gneb method was applied to the chlc in external electric field , for which parameter values listed in sec .",
    "[ sec2]b were used . for each value of the applied voltage ,",
    "both p and d state were found by minimizing the total energy of the system and the mep between them was identified .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the energy change along the mep for the transition between p and d states in the chlc , where the magnitude of applied voltage was chosen to be @xmath116 mv , at which the energy levels of p and d states coincide .",

    "while the images at the ends of the mep correspond to stable configurations in the chlc ( p and d states ) , intermediate images provide information about changes in the system during the transition between the states .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrates intermediate configurations of the chlc during the transition from p to d state for @xmath117 .",

    "the minimum of @xmath6 does not change its position on the @xmath3-axis along the mep . for the rigid boundary conditions",
    ", this minimum is in the middle of the cell , but it is shifted towards a boundary with a smaller anchoring coefficient for the soft boundary conditions . for each image along the mep , the azimuthal angle @xmath119 demonstrates small deviation from the straight line @xmath120 .",
    "figure  [ fig4](b ) shows the magnitude of this deviation , @xmath121 , as a function of @xmath3 for several images along the mep between p and d states .",
    "@xmath121 is antisymmetric with respect to the center of the cell for the rigid boundary conditions .",
    "however , the symmetry is broken in the case of soft boundary conditions .",
    "the chirality of the system is defined by the parameter @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath123 , then @xmath7 changes clockwise .",
    "if @xmath124 , the chirality becomes anticlockwise .",

    "the inset ( b ) : @xmath121 for the opposite twist of the chlc . ]    changes in external electric field lead to the changes in the shape of the energy surface and , therefore , meps between states as well as the corresponding energy barriers .",
    "[ fig5](a ) shows the meps for five various magnitudes of applied voltage . at @xmath77 ( curve 1 ) the energy along",
    "the mep is completely flat at one of the ends of the path , which is a signature of the emergence of d state .",
    "the d state energy minimum becomes more pronounced as the voltage increases , while the p state minimum becomes shallower ( curve 2 ) .",
    "therefore , there is a threshold voltage , @xmath117 , at which the energy levels of both configurations coincide ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if the voltage is further increased , p configuration becomes a metastable state ( curves 3 , 4 and 5 ) .",
    "although the p state is not a ground state of the system in the voltage range between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , there is still a finite barrier separating this state from d state .",
    "if the system is initially prepared in p state and effect of temperature is not included , this barrier prevents the system from passing to d state even if voltage is close to @xmath127 and transition occurs only if the barrier vanishes , i.e. the voltage reaches the value of @xmath127",
    ". however , thermal fluctuations can be sufficient to induce over - the - barrier transitions on the laboratory time scale , which renormalizes the transition voltage .",
    "barrier for the p@xmath128d transition monotonically decreases to zero with the applied voltage , while the barrier for the inverse transition gets larger as the voltage is increased .",
    "two curves intersect at @xmath117 fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "a variation of anchoring coefficients also changes the energy surface .",
    "dependence of mep on the anchoring coefficient @xmath129 while other anchoring coefficients are kept fixed is shown in  figure  [ fig6](a ) .",
    "the energy of the d state increases monotonously compared to that of the p state as the anchoring coefficient at the upper boundary gets larger .",
    "thus , variation of the anchoring coefficient has similar effect as variation of voltage : there is a threshold value of @xmath129 at which the energy levels of both states are the same .",
    "further increase in @xmath129 makes d state metastable first ( curve 2 ) and then unstable ( curve 3 ) .",
    "barriers for between p and d state also strongly depend on the anchoring coefficient .     at the upper boundary .",
    "the reaction coordinate is defined as the displacement along the path normalized by its total length .",
    "( b ) energy barrier for transition from the p to d state ( solid line ) and for the inverse transition ( dashed line ) as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "voltage is taken to be @xmath130mv . ]",
    "similar behavior takes place in an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , the voltage , the magnetic field and anchoring coefficients can be used for tuning the energy barrier separated two states .",
    "these results can now be used to estimate how characteristics of the fredericksz transition change with temperature .",
    "usually such influence is explained in terms of temperature dependent adjustment of the frank modules or other parameters of a liquid crystal .",
    "indeed , the variation of frank modules modifies the energy surface and , therefore , may change the transition field .",
    "however , quantitative assessment of thermally activated transitions between states in liquid crystal can explain the effective renormalization of parameters of the fredericksz transition .    in particular , the temperature dependence of the transition voltage @xmath127 can be explained as follows .",
    "the system will remain in p state until the applied voltage has lowered the energy barrier sufficiently and , thereby , decreased the lifetime of p state sufficiently for the transition to d state to occur on the laboratory time scale . according to eq .",
    "( [ arrhen ] ) , the lifetime is mostly defined by the energy barrier , @xmath131 which is strongly voltage - dependent ( see fig .  [ fig5](a ) ) . assuming constant pre - exponential factor ,",
    "the change in @xmath127 can be predicted from the the following equation that can be obtained from the arrhenius fromula ( see eq .",
