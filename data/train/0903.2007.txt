    "the swift progress in molecular electronics achieved during the past decade has mostly been centered around a detailed understanding of charge transport through single - molecule junctions,@xcite where quantum effects generally turn out to be important .",

    "experiments have observed gate - tunable josephson currents through nanoscale junctions , @xcite including out - of - equilibrium cases , and many different interesting phenomena have been uncovered .",

    "double occupancy on the molecular level is then forbidden , and the remaining allowed processes generate the sign change in @xmath4.@xcite the most natural way to explain the @xmath0-junction behavior is by perturbation theory in the tunnel couplings connecting the molecule to the electrodes .",
    "experimental observations of the @xmath0-phase were recently reported for inas nanowire dots@xcite and for nanotubes,@xcite but a @xmath0-junction is also encountered in superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor structures.@xcite accordingly , theoretical works have also analyzed spin effects in molecular magnets coupled to superconductors.@xcite    the impressive experimental control over supercurrents through molecular junctions reviewed above implies that modifications of the supercurrent due to vibrational modes of the molecule play a significant and observable role.@xcite we have recently discussed how a _ two - level system _ ( tls ) coupled to the dot s charge is affected by the josephson current carried by andreev states.@xcite for instance , two conformational configurations of a molecule may realize such a tls degree of freedom .",
