    "the production of weak boson pairs is an important topic to study at hadron colliders because these processes can be used to test the standard model ( sm ) as well as probe beyond it @xcite .",
    "diboson production is important for the following reasons .    *",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 processes can be used to test the trilinear @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings .",
    "these couplings are completely fixed by the @xmath10 gauge structure of the sm , thus measurements of these couplings provide stringent tests of the sm .",
    "remarkable progress has recently been made in measuring these couplings at the fermilab tevatron collider @xcite . *",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism can be probed by studying weak boson pair production .",
    "the ewsb mechanism is unknown , but it is believed that either there exists a scalar particle with mass @xmath11  tev or else the longitudinal components of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons become strongly interacting for parton center - of - mass energies larger that about 1  tev @xcite .",
    "for example , the observation of resonance production of @xmath2 , @xmath7 , or @xmath14 would be a signal for the standard model higgs boson , whereas enhanced production of longitudinally polarized @xmath12 and @xmath13 pairs would be evidence for a strongly interacting ewsb scenario .",
    "* diboson production is a potential background to new physics .",
    "new heavy particles , such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 can decay into weak boson pairs .    in order to test and probe the sm with hadronic diboson production , it is necessary to have precise calculations of sm diboson production , which means",
    "the cross sections must be calculated to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) .",
    "the nlo cross section is , in general , less sensitive to the choices of the arbitrary factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "the results described here are based on complete @xmath23 calculations of the processes @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the calculations also include the leptonic decays of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons @xcite .",
    "this is an important feature to include since the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons are observed experimentally via their leptonic decay products .",
    "it is therefore important to include the experimental cuts on the decay leptons when comparing a theoretical calculation to the experimental data .",
    "the calculations have been done using a combination of analytic and monte carlo integration techniques . among the advantages of this formalism",
    "are :    * it is easy to impose cuts in the calculation . *",
    "it is possible to calculate any number of observables simultaneously by simply histogramming the quantity of interest . *",
    "it is possible to calculate not only the nlo inclusive cross section , but also the 0-jet and 1-jet exclusive cross sections .",
    "details of the formalism can be found in the original references @xcite .",
    "the first processes to be considered are the @xmath1 and @xmath26 processes . the total lo and nlo cross sections for these processes are plotted as functions of the center of mass energy in fig .  1 .",
    "the difference between the nlo and lo curves is the @xmath23 correction . in the @xmath1 process ,",
    "the @xmath23 corrections range from 10% to 30% over the domain of @xmath27 .",
    "this is what one naively expects since @xmath5 is of order 0.10 . in the @xmath26 process , on the other hand , the corrections range from 20% at small @xmath27 to a surprising 300% at large @xmath27 .    in order to understand the large @xmath23 corrections in the @xmath26 process , it is instructive to compare the behavior of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes for @xmath1 and @xmath26 production . figure  2(a )",
    "compares the @xmath30 cross sections .",
    "normally , hadronic @xmath12 production is about twice as large as hadronic @xmath13 production because the @xmath12-to - quark coupling is about twice as big as the @xmath13-to - quark coupling .",
    "however , for the @xmath26 and @xmath1 processes , exactly the opposite behavior is seen ; the @xmath26 cross section is only half as big as the @xmath1 cross section . the @xmath26 cross section is smaller because it is suppressed by a radiation amplitude zero ( raz ) @xcite .",
    "delicate cancellations in the @xmath0 amplitude cause it to vanish at @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the parton center - of - mass scattering angle .",
    "the @xmath29 cross sections for @xmath26 and @xmath1 are compared in fig .",
    "2(b ) . here a jet is defined as a final state quark or gluon with transverse momentum @xmath33  gev and pseudorapidity @xmath34 .",
    "the cross sections have been decomposed into contributions from @xmath35 and @xmath36 initial states ( @xmath35 also includes @xmath37 ) .",
    "the @xmath38  jet cross section is about twice as big as the @xmath39  jet cross section , as naively expected .",
    "( the @xmath40 subprocess does not have a raz . ) the @xmath41  jet and @xmath42  jet cross sections , on the other hand , are nearly equal , indicating that the former is still suppressed relative to the later .",
    "( the @xmath43 subprocess has a raz in the limit @xmath44 . )    in summary , the @xmath28 @xmath26 cross section is suppressed relative to the @xmath28 @xmath1 cross section by a raz , while the @xmath29 @xmath26 cross section is larger than the @xmath45 @xmath1 cross section due to the larger @xmath12-to - quark coupling .",
    "the net result of these two behaviors is that the @xmath46 corrections are much larger for @xmath26 production than for @xmath1 production .",
    "figure  3 again shows the total @xmath1 and @xmath26 cross sections versus @xmath27 , but now the nlo cross sections have been decomposed into the born cross sections and @xmath46 corrections from @xmath47 and @xmath35 initial states .",
    "this decomposition shows that the @xmath46 @xmath36 corrections tend to be proportional to the born cross section , whereas the @xmath48 @xmath35 corrections increase rapidly with @xmath27 . the @xmath46 @xmath35 corrections increase with @xmath27 because the gluon density increases with @xmath27 .",
    "figure  4 shows the @xmath49 spectra for @xmath1 and @xmath50 production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) center of mass energy ( @xmath51  tev ) .",
    "the figure shows that the nlo corrections increase with @xmath49 . this behavior is common to all the diboson processes ; the nlo corrections increase with the @xmath52 of the boson .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the photon in the diboson rest frame is shown in fig .  5 for the tevatron center of mass energy ( @xmath53  tev ) .",
    "for the @xmath1 process , the distribution exhibits the usual bell - shaped rapidity distribution , however , for the @xmath26 process , the distribution has a pronounced dip in the central rapidity region .",
    "this dip is due to the raz in the @xmath26 process . at the tevatron energy ,",
    "the nlo corrections slightly fill the dip , but do not obscure it .",
    "figure  6 shows the photon rapidity distribution at the lhc energy .",
    "the nlo corrections are now very large in the @xmath26 process and they completely fill the dip in the central rapidity region",
    ". it may still be possible , however , to observe the dip in the @xmath54  jet exclusive cross section @xcite .",
    "figure  7 compares the @xmath49 spectra for the @xmath1 and @xmath26 processes at the tevatron energy .",
    "this comparison shows that at high @xmath49 , the @xmath26 distribution falls more rapidly than the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "this behavior is also due to the raz in the @xmath26 process .",
    "attention now turns to the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath55 processes .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions for these processes are shown in fig .",
    "the figure shows that the nlo corrections increase with the @xmath52 of the weak boson and are quite large at high values of @xmath52 .",
    "also note that the nlo corrections increase in the order @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath55 .",
    "this behavior will be discussed later .",
    "figure  9 again shows the @xmath52 spectra of the weak bosons , but now the 0-jet and 1-jet exclusive components of the nlo inclusive cross section are also shown .",
    "( the 0-jet and 1-jet exclusive cross sections sum to the nlo inclusive cross section . )",
    "this decomposition shows that the bulk of the large corrections at high @xmath52 are due to events containing a hard jet in the final state .",
    "the jet definition used here is @xmath56  gev and @xmath57 .",
    "the large enhancements to the cross section at high @xmath52 can be traced to collinear splittings in diagrams such as @xmath58 followed by @xmath59 ; the @xmath13 and the quark are produced with high @xmath52 and the quark subsequently radiates a nearly collinear @xmath12 . in the collinear limit",
    ", the @xmath60 subprocess can be approximated by @xcite @xmath61 figure  10 compares this collinear approximation to the full nlo calculation and shows that the approximation describes well the shape of the @xmath52 distribution at high @xmath52 .",
    "the scale dependance of the total @xmath55 cross section is illustrated in fig .",
    "a common scale @xmath62 has been used for both the renormalization scale @xmath63 and the factorization scale @xmath64 .",
    "the born and nlo inclusive cross sections are shown along with the 0-jet and 1-jet components of the nlo inclusive cross section .",
    "the 1-jet cross section is a lo quantity and thus has considerable scale dependance .",
    "the 0-jet cross section , on the other hand , is a nlo quantity and exhibits little scale dependance .",
    "the decomposition shows that the scale dependance of the nlo inclusive cross section is dominated by the scale dependance of the 1-jet component .",
    "figure  12 compares the @xmath52 spectra of the weak bosons for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath55 processes .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions have the same shape at high @xmath52 and are parallel to one another , whereas the @xmath55 distribution falls more rapidly .",
    "a similar behavior was observed earlier in fig .",
    "7 where the @xmath1 and @xmath26 processes were compared . in the present case , the @xmath55 @xmath52 spectrum falls faster than the @xmath2 and @xmath7 spectra because of an approximate amplitude zero @xcite in the @xmath55 process .",
    "the @xmath65 subprocess is very similar to the @xmath66 subprocess , in fact , they are described by the same set of feynman diagrams , with @xmath13 and @xmath67 interchanged .",
    "recall that the raz in the @xmath26 process gave rise to a large @xmath68 correction .",
    "a difference between the two processes is that whereas the @xmath0 process has an exact amplitude zero at @xmath31 , the @xmath6 process has only an approximate amplitude zero at @xmath69 .",
    "basically , what happens in the @xmath55 case is that the dominant helicity amplitudes have an exact zero , while the other helicity amplitudes remain finite but small .",
    "the approximate amplitude zero in the @xmath55 process causes the nlo corrections to be larger than they were in either the @xmath2 or @xmath7 processes .",
    "the approximate amplitude zero suppresses the @xmath55 born cross section and thus makes the nlo corrections appear large .",
    "a more in depth discussion of approximate amplitude zeros can be found in the talk by t.  han @xcite .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections to weak boson pair production at hadron colliders has been reviewed . the @xmath70 )",
    "cross sections for the diboson combinations @xmath1 , @xmath26 , @xmath2 , @xmath71 , and @xmath55 have been discussed and compared .",
    "some general features of the @xmath23 cross sections are summarized here .    * the nlo corrections increase with the center - of - mass energy .",
    "this is due to the opening of the @xmath72 subprocess at @xmath46 in conjunction with the gluon density which increases with the center - of - mass energy . *",
    "the nlo corrections are largest at high @xmath73 .",
    "this is due to collinear splittings in the @xmath72 subprocesses which give rise to an enhancement factor @xmath74 . *",
    "the bulk of the large corrections at high @xmath73 come from events which contain a hard jet in the final state .",
    "* @xmath52 distributions are most affected by the nlo corrections .",
    "these distributions tend to be enhanced at large values of @xmath52 .",
    "* invariant mass and angular distributions under go relatively little change in shape at nlo , instead , these distributions tend to be scaled up uniformly . * the nlo corrections to @xmath26 production are large due to a radiation amplitude zero . * the nlo corrections to @xmath55 production are large due to an approximate amplitude zero . *",
    "the nlo corrections are modest at the tevatron center of mass energy but are significant at the lhc energy .",
