    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite is a very powerful method to analyze the phase structures and phase transitions in strongly coupled quantum many - body systems .",
    "this is because these complicated quantum problems are equivalently mapped to the study of their gravity duals , each of which is often described by a classical einstein gravity coupled to various matter fields .",
    "a rich phase diagram can appear in quantum many - body systems when there are many competing and mutually frustrating interactions .",
    "for example , one of the richest and most interesting phase structures has been known to appear in strongly correlated materials , such as the cuprate high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite ( see the fig .",
    "[ fig : htc ] in the main text ) , and layered organic conductors . in the phase diagram of high-@xmath1 , an insulator phase with the antiferromagnetic order ( called the mott insulator )",
    "is located close to the superconductor phase .",
    "this implies that the strong coulomb repulsive interaction is behind the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity : it is highly likely that superconductivity is not driven by a conventional mechanism due to simple attractive forces . instead the superconductivity emerges as the best compromise among many competing ground states .",
    "adjacent to the mott insulator and superconductor phases , there appear the pseudo gap and strange metal phases , where transport properties are highly unusual .",
    "as we increase doping @xmath6 beyond the superconductivity phase , there is the fermi - liquid phase .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study such a complex competition of different quantum ground states in a simple setup of ads / cft .",
    "following the idea of the holographic superconductor @xcite , we consider the einstein gravity coupled to a @xmath7 gauge field and a charged scalar field .",
    "the @xmath7 gauge field is interpreted as an r - charge and the scalar field is dual to an r - charged operator .",
    "an important difference from the earlier works is that in our setup the holographic superconductor is put in the five - dimensional ads soliton background @xcite .",
    "as we compactify one of the space directions in this asymptotic ads spacetime , the ads soliton is dual to a scherk - schwarz compactification of a four - dimensional conformal gauge theory , such as the @xmath8 super yang - mills theory .",
    "the dual field theory is thus ( 2 + 1)-dimensional as is so in the high-@xmath1 superconductors .    in the holographic superconductors",
    ", there is a finite temperature superconductor - metal transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the ads soliton background decays into ads black hole via a hawking - page transition @xcite , which is dual to the confinement / deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "one of our main findings is that at zero temperature , as we change the chemical potential , there is an intervening phase between the holographic superconductor phase and the confining phase , which we call the ads soliton superconductor phase ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic phase in intro ] in the main text ) . while this phase is similar to the holographic superconductor phase ( labeled as the ads bh superconductor phase in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic phase in intro ] ) in the sense that it is the phase where the charged scalar condenses , this phase has a much larger gap . the confinement phase ( labeled as the ads soliton in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic phase in intro ] ) is a phase with a mass gap and an analogue of an insulator in electronic systems .",
    "our setup thus realizes , as we change the chemical potential , an insulator - to - superconductor quantum phase transition .",
    "we will compare these findings with the rvb ( resonating valence bond ) approach to high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite .",
    "the rvb theory starts by taking into account the effects of the strong coulomb interaction which is most operative near zero doping , @xmath9 .",
    "the strong coulomb repulsion forbids any site to be occupied by more than one electron , and thus serves effectively as a constraint on the physical hilbert space .",
    "this constraint can be written as a gauge constraint , and therefore physics of high-@xmath1 superconductors near @xmath9 can be written in the language of an @xmath10 gauge theory ( the gauge group depends on , at the level of the mean field theory , the choice of a saddle point . )",
    "the quasi - particles charged under the gauge field is not an electron , but an emergent entity which carries a fraction of the quantum number of electrons .",
    "the abnormal phases in high-@xmath1 , i.e. , the phases which are not well - described in terms of electrons , can then be potentially described in terms of these emergent particles when they are deconfined , whereas confinement thereof gives rise to conventional phases .",
    "the high-@xmath1 superconductor thus provides a venue where there is a complex interplay between confinement / deconfinement physics and superconductivity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ bubblesc ] , we will show that an superconductor / insulator phase transition will occur in the ads soliton background . in section [ ads5 charged black hole and superconductor ] , we will analyze the superconductor phase in the ads@xmath11 black hole . in section [ phase structure ]",
    ", we will consider the phase diagram of our system and discuss its relation to the rvb approach to the high-@xmath1 superconductors . in section [ conclusions ] we will summarize conclusions .",
    "let us begin with the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell - scalar theory : @xmath12 notice that almost the same system appears in the ads@xmath13s@xmath14 compactification dual to @xmath8 super yang - mills .",
    "there , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be dual to a r - charge current and a r - charged operator with charge @xmath17 , though we will not further pursuit a string theory interpretation in this paper . in section 4.3",
    ", we will show that we can consistently embed our phase transition into the @xmath18 superconformal field theory dual to ads@xmath19 .    in this theory ,",
    "our setup is defined by an asymptotically ads spacetime which approaches to @xmath20 near the boundary . in this section",
    "we only consider the case of zero temperature .",
    "we impose the anti - periodic boundary condition for fermions ( i.e. scherk - schwarz boundary condition ) in the @xmath21 direction . when the gauge field is vanishing , the most stable configuration which satisfies this property",
    "is known as the ads soliton @xcite given by the metric @xmath22 this can be obtained by double wick rotating the ads schwarzschild black hole . in order to have a smooth geometry we need to impose the periodicity @xmath23 for the scherk - schwarz circle .",
    "if we extract the coordinates @xmath24 , the geometry looks like a cigar , whose tip is given by @xmath25 .",
    "now we take into account the coupling of this system to the gauge field .",
    "we can easily find a simple solution with the constant gauge potential @xmath26 .",
    "notice that as opposed to the ads black holes which require @xmath27 at the horizon , the boundary condition is chosen so that the gauge field is non - singular at the tip .      in the presence of charged scalar field as in ( [ emsaction ] ) , the phase structure can be more non - trivial as the scalar field can condense",
    ". we would like to analyze this below assuming that the backreaction of the gauge field and scalar to the metric ( [ bubblesol ] ) is negligible .",
    "we focus on the solutions depending on only radial coordinate as follows : @xmath28 moreover , we take @xmath16 to be real due to the maxwell equation",
    ". we can also set @xmath29 and @xmath30 without losing generality . at zero temperature",
    "the system depends on the parameters @xmath31 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath32    we have to impose the boundary condition at the tip @xmath25 and the boundary @xmath33 to solve the above equations .",
    "we will concentrate on the case where @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 which satisfies the bf bound @xmath36 . though this is just for simplicity",
    ", we can still extend our analysis to general values of @xmath34 .",
    "near the boundary , the solutions behave as @xmath37 at this value of @xmath34 , there are two alternative descriptions since both terms , proportional to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , become normalizable .",
    "we defined the corresponding dual operators by @xmath40 and @xmath41 whose conformal dimensions are give by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .    on the other hand , at the tip these behave as @xmath44 therefore , we impose the neumann - like boundary condition @xmath45 to take every physical quantities finite .    in ( [ gaugeex ] ) , the constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 are holographically dual to the chemical potential ( gauge potential ) and the charge density , respectively .",
    "as is clear from ( [ hceom ] ) , the equations of motion have the scaling symmetry @xmath48 . by taking @xmath49 ( the probe limit ) , we can indeed neglect the back reactions of @xmath50 and @xmath16 to the metric as in the standard holographic superconductors @xcite .",
    "in other words , this probe approximation is justified when @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 kept finite .",
    "once we take this probe limit , the functional form of physical quantities up to the overall scaling only depend on the combination @xmath53 in this probe limit .",
    "thus below we will simply set @xmath54 .    in the ads",
    "/ cft dictionary , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath50 gives the chemical potential @xmath55 and charge density @xmath47 in the dual field theory .",
    "the scalar operator @xmath56 coupled to the scalar field @xmath16 is ( up to a normalization ) @xmath57 with the boundary condition @xmath58 .",
    "we can plot @xmath59 with respect to the chemical potential @xmath55 by numerical calculations and find that the condensation occurs if @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig : condensate ] .",

    "[ fig : condensate ] , title=\"fig:\",height=132 ]    in this way , we find a phase transition triggered by the scalar field condensation in the ads soliton background .",
    "we also find that it is a second order phase transition as is clear if we plot the charge density @xmath65 as a function of @xmath46 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhomu ] .",
    "when @xmath46 is small , the system is described by the ads soliton solution itself .",
    "this is interpreted as the insulator phase as this system has a mass gap , which is due to the confinement in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory viewpoint via the scherk - schwarz compactification . on the other hand , for a larger @xmath46 , it undergoes a phase transition and is expected to reach a superconductor ( or superfluid ) phase .",
    "thus we can regard this as the holographic realization of superconductor / insulator transition .",
    "plotted as a function of @xmath46 when @xmath66 ( left ) and @xmath67 ( right ) .",
    "its derivative jumps at the phase transition point .",

    "[ fig : rhomu],title=\"fig:\",height=132 ]    the mechanism of this transition is similar to the standard holographic superconductors @xcite , but is different in that our phase transition occurs even at strictly zero temperature .",
    "we also give an explanation of the transition by relating it to the schr \" odinger problem in the appendix a.    if we impose the periodic boundary condition instead of the anti - periodic one for fermions , the story will change largely because the ads soliton phase is not available and the confinement will not occur at zero temperature . in this case , we need to consider a zero temperature limit of holographic superconductor in ads black holes , which has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss this case in this paper .",
    "so far we only consider the zero temperature system . at finite temperature @xmath68",
    ", it is described by compactifying the euclidean time direction .",
    "when @xmath68 is greater than a certain value @xmath1 , a phase transition like confinement / deconfinement transition occurs as we will see later .",
    "thus our argument of phase transition can equally be applied to the finite temperature case as long as we have @xmath69 and we can ignore the back reaction .      we can holographically calculate the conductivity @xmath70 by solving the equation of motion of @xmath71 : @xmath72 by requiring the neumann boundary condition at the tip @xmath25 as in ( [ neumann ] ) .",
    "looking at the asymptotic behavior near the boundary @xmath73 a_x = a_x^(0)+++  , the holographic conductivity is found as follows @xcite ( ) = +  .",
    "first let us consider the ads soliton background ( [ bubblesol ] ) without the scalar condensation . since there is no horizon ,",
    "the equation of motion with the boundary condition at the tip requires that @xmath74 is real .",
    "therefore the real part of the conductivity vanishes .",
    "this means that there is no dissipation and is consistent with the absence of horizon .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath70 is plotted in the left graph of fig .",

    "the appearance of the emergent non - abelian gauge group @xmath171 in the rvb theory motivates us to consider its holographic dual gravity description .",
    "indeed , here we would like to argue that our gravity system discussed in this paper is analogous to the rvb theory of high-@xmath1 superconductors , though the large @xmath189 limit has only a qualitative relevance to our problem limit with the gauge group @xmath190 . ] . before we proceed to the comparison between them , we need to notice that the quantum field theory dual to our gravity system does not include massless fermions , while the rvb theory has fermionic spinons .",
    "this might be taken into account in the gravity side by introducing another ( uncharged ) scalar field which is dual to a fermion bilinear @xmath185 that condenses for small @xmath68 and @xmath6 .",
    "one possibility of string theory realization of this will be to add a d7-brane to our d3-brane system and @xmath191 .",

    "however , here we would like to leave the further analysis for a future work and to proceed by roughly identifying the confined phase and fermion condensed phase , as the latter is induced to the strongly coupled gauge interactions .",
    "we first identify the confined phase ( the ads soliton phase ) as a fully - gapped phase of electrons , such as the valence bond solid ( vbs ) phase , or the stripe phase that exists in @xmath192 at @xmath193 . in the slave boson theory ,",
    "such a phase is a confined phase where spinons and holons are completely glued together , and all excitations as well as the ground state are well - described in terms electrons . it may also be possible to identify it with the antiferromagnetic phase in the high-@xmath1 cuprates , where the low - lying excitation is antiferromagnetic magnons , which is a bound state of two spinons",
    "this gapless antiferromagnetic magnon may be interpreted as a nambu - goldstone boson induced by the fermion condensation .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath46 in the gravity theory plays the similar role as doping @xmath6 in the cuprates ; the chemical potential @xmath46 destroys the confining phase ( the ads soliton phase ) just like doping @xmath6 frustrates the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the phase emerges as we increase @xmath6 in the cuprates is superconducting phase ; the corresponding phase in the gravity theory is the ads soliton superconductor phase that emerges as we increase @xmath46 . at the mean field level , the superconducting phase in the cuprates is the phase where holons are condensed . in the gravity",
    "dual , this is interpreted as the condensation of the scalar field @xmath50 . note that in this identification we are not viewing the scalar field @xmath50 as the cooper pair , but a gauge invariant operator made from two holons .",
    "it is then tempting to identify the deconfining phase ( the ads rn black hole phase ) , lying in the high temperature region above the ads soliton and the ads soliton superconductor phases , as the pseudo gap phase and the strange metal phase in high-@xmath1 , which crossover with each other .",
    "indeed , the ads rn black hole phase , in the presence of fermions , shows the non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite due to the near horizon ads@xmath194 geometry @xcite . in the eariler literature @xcite , the relevance of ads charged black hole was pointed out in order to construct the gravity dual of fermi surfaces .",
    "all of these are supportive for our identification of the ads rn black hole phase as the pseudo gap or the strange metal phase , and also the ads soliton superconductor phase as the superconductor phase of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .    one may notice that while the pairing symmetry of the cuprate high-@xmath1 superconductivity is known to be @xmath195-wave , there is nothing comparable to it in our gravity calculations .",
    "however , this is not a serious problem as our gravity calculation corresponds to a effective field theory limit and can not directly distinguish between @xmath196-wave and @xmath195-wave as is so in the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "finally , the ads bh superconductor phase that exists for the large chemical potential can be considered as the fermi liquid phase in the over - doped cuprates . even though its gravity dual is a superconductor , the fermions do not condense in our approximation as it is situated at the deconfined phase .",
    "notice that the expectation value of cooper pair ( assuming @xmath197 ) c_ic_j - c_ic_j_ijb^_1ib^_1j  , is non - vanishing iff both the fermions and holons condense .",
    "therefore , this system from the viewpoint of electrons should not be regarded as a superconductor .",
    "instead , it is an ordinary fermi liquid as the spin and charge are tied strongly due to the holon condensation .",
    "now let us compare the global phase structure of our holographic system and that of the rvb theory .",
    "at the qualitative level , they look quite similar except that our system does not actually include the massless fermions ( spinons ) , which makes the distinction between the pseudo gap phase and the strange metal phase unclear . even though we did not realize the fermions , it is not difficult to speculate how the phase structure of our gravity system changes , for example , by including an extra scalar field which is uncharged under the @xmath7 and is dual to the fermion bilinear .",
    "we expect that the fermion pair condensation continues slightly above the confinement / deconfinement phase boundary as in the familiar d3-d7 example @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalphase ] and we filled in the corresponding phase in high-@xmath1 .    one may notice that in hole doped high-@xmath1 superconductors , the antiferromagnetic phase is not exactly next to the superconductor phase ( see fig .  [",

    "we showed that this system undergoes a phase transition into a superconductor phase ( ads soliton superconductor phase ) due to the charged scalar field condensation when we increase the chemical potential at least for specific values of the mass and charge of the scalar field .",

    ". it may also be intriguing to calculate the entanglement entropy via the ads / cft @xcite to understand better the phase transition between the insulator and superconductor phase because this quantity is non - vanishing even at zero temperature ( for the confinement / deconfinement phase transition , this was done in @xcite ) .",
