    "in wireless communications , channel conditions vary randomly over time due to mobility and changing environment , and the degree of channel side information ( csi ) assumed to be available at the receiver and transmitter is a key assumption in the study of wireless fading channels . the case in which the channel is assumed",

    "@xcite studied the capacity of the unknown rayleigh fading channel and showed that the optimal input amplitude has a discrete structure .",

    "the discreteness of the capacity - achieving amplitude distribution is proven for noncoherent rician fading channels under input peakedness constraints .",
    "when the input is subject to peak power constraints , the discrete nature of the optimal input is shown for a general class of single - input single - output channels in @xcite .",
    "marzetta and hochwald @xcite gave a characterization of the optimal input structure for unknown multiple - antenna rayleigh fading channels .",
    "this analysis subsequently led to the proposal of unitary space - time modulation techniques @xcite .",

    "zheng and tse @xcite analyzed the multiple - antenna rayleigh channels and identified the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) behavior of the channel capacity .",
    "heretofore , the two extreme assumptions of having either perfect csi or no csi have been discussed .",
    "practical wireless systems live in between these two extremes . unless there is very high mobility ,",
    "wireless systems generally employ estimation techniques to learn the channel conditions , albeit with errors .",
    "hence , it is of utmost interest to analyze fading channels with imperfect csi .",

    "similar training techniques are also discussed in @xcite . due to its practical significance",
    ", the information - theoretic analysis of training schemes has attracted much interest ( see e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) . since exact capacity expressions are difficult to find , these studies have optimized the training signal power , duration , and placement using capacity bounds .",
    "since gaussian noise is the worst - case uncorrelated additive noise in a gaussian setting @xcite , a capacity lower bound is generally obtained by assuming the product of the estimate error and the transmitted signal as another source of gaussian noise . in the above cited work , training symbols are employed to solely facilitate channel estimation .",

    "will improve the efficiency .",
    "hence , the energy required to reliably send one bit is a metric that can be adopted to measure the performance . generally , energy - per - bit requirement is minimized , and hence the energy efficiency is maximized , if the system operates in the low-@xmath0 regime . in @xcite , verd has analyzed the tradeoff between the spectral efficiency and bit energy in the low-@xmath0 regime for a general class of channels and shown that the normalized received minimum bit energy of @xmath1 db is achieved as @xmath2 in averaged power limits channels regardless of the availability of csi at the receiver . on the other hand , @xcite has proven that if the receiver has imperfect csi , the wideband slope , which is the slope of the spectral efficiency curve at zero spectral efficiency , is zero .",
    "hence , approaching the minimum bit energy of @xmath1 db is extremely slow , and moreover it requires input signals with increasingly higher peak - to - average power ratios .",
    "the impact upon the energy efficiency of limiting the peakedness of signals is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the wideband channel capacity in the presence of input peakedness constraints is investigated in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    energy efficiency , which is of paramount importance in many wireless systems , has not been the core focus of the aforementioned work on training schemes . moreover ,",

    "note that at low @xmath0 levels , the quality of the channel estimate is far from being perfect .",
    "we quantify the performance losses in terms of energy efficiency in the worst - case scenario where the estimate is assumed to be perfect .",
    "we identify an @xmath0 level below which one should avoid operating .",

    "optimal resource allocation is performed using the exact capacity values .",
    "improvements in energy efficiency with respect to the worst - case scenario are shown .",
    "* we compare the performances of untrained noncoherent and training - based communication schemes under peak power constraints and show through numerical results that performance loss experienced by training - based schemes is small even at low @xmath0 levels and small values of coherence time . on the other hand , if data symbols are interleaved and experience independent fading , we show that training - based schemes outperform noncoherent techniques . *",
    "we find the attainable bit energy levels in the low-@xmath0 regime when limitations on the peak - to - average power ratio are relaxed and on - off keying with fixed power and vanishing duty cycle is used to transmit information .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : channelmodel ] provides the channel model . in section [ sec : trainingscheme ] , training - based transmission and reception is described . in section [ sec : worstcase ] , we study the achievable rates and energy efficiency in the case where the product of the channel estimate and the transmitted signal is assumed to be gaussian noise . in section",

    "it is assumed that the fading coefficients stay constant for a block of @xmath3 symbols and have independent realizations for each block .",
    "it is further assumed that neither the transmitter nor the receiver has prior knowledge of the realizations of the fading coefficients .",
    "we assume that pilot symbols are employed in the system to facilitate channel estimation at the receiver .",
    "hence , the system operates in two phases , namely training and data transmission . in the training phase",
    ", pilot symbols known at the receiver are sent from the transmitter and the received signal is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are @xmath17-dimensional vectors signifying the fact that @xmath17 out of @xmath3 input symbols are devoted to training .",
    "it is assumed that the receiver employs minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) estimation to obtain the estimate @xmath18 with this estimate , the fading coefficient can now be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 note that @xmath21 denotes the error in the channel estimate .",
    "following the training phase , the transmitter sends the ( @xmath22)-dimensional data vector @xmath23 , and the receiver equipped with the knowledge of the channel estimate operates on the received signal @xmath24 to recover the transmitted information .",
    "we note that since training - based schemes are studied in this paper , memoryless fading channels in which @xmath25 are not considered , and it is assumed throughout the paper that the block length satisfies @xmath26 .",
    "in this section , we assume that the input is subject to an average power constraint @xmath27 our overall goal is to identify the bit energy values that can be attained with optimized training parameters such as the power and duration of pilot symbols .",
    "the least amount of energy required to send one information bit reliably is given by is the bit energy normalized by the noise power spectral level @xmath28 . ]",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the channel capacity in bits / symbol . in this section ,",
    "we follow the general approach in the literature and consider a lower bound on the channel capacity by assuming that @xmath31 is a gaussian noise vector that has a covariance of @xmath32 and is uncorrelated with the input signal @xmath23 . with this assumption ,",
    "the channel model becomes @xmath33 this model is called the worst - case scenario since the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , and the noise is modeled as gaussian , which presents the worst case @xcite .",
    "the capacity of the channel in ( [ eq : worstcasemodel ] ) , which acts as a lower bound on the capacity of the channel in ( [ eq : dataphasemodel ] ) , is achieved by a gaussian input with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the optimal fraction of power allocated to the pilot symbol , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "the optimal value is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 note that @xmath0 in ( [ eq : eta+snr ] ) is the received signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in the average power limited case , sending a single pilot is optimal because instead of increasing the number of pilot symbols , a single pilot with higher power can be used and a decrease in the duration of the data transmission can be avoided .",
    "hence , the optimal @xmath23 is an ( @xmath39)-dimensional gaussian vector .",
    "since the above results are indeed special cases of those in @xcite , the details are omitted . the resulting capacity expression . ]",
    "is @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "note also that the expectation in ( [ eq : worstcap ] ) is with respect to the random variable @xmath42 .",
    "the bit energy values in this setting are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is in nats / symbol .",
    "@xmath45 provides the least amount of normalized bit energy values in the worst - case scenario and also serves as an upper bound on the achievable bit energy levels of channel ( [ eq : dataphasemodel ] ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , and gaussian codebooks designed for known channels are used , and scaled nearest neighbor decoding is employed at the receiver , then the generalized mutual information has an expression similar to ( [ eq : worstcap ] ) ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.0.1 ) ) .",
    "hence @xmath45 also gives a good indication of the energy requirements of a system operating in this fashion .",
    "the next result provides the asymptotic behavior of the bit energy as @xmath0 decreases to zero .",
    "[ lemma : bitenergylow ] the normalized bit energy ( [ eq : worstengy ] ) grows without bound as the signal - to - noise ratio decreases to zero , i.e. , @xmath46    _ proof _ : in the low snr regime , we have @xmath47 as @xmath2 , @xmath48 , and hence @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath53    the fact that @xmath44 decreases as @xmath54 as @xmath0 goes to zero has already been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that as @xmath0 decreases , the power of @xmath55 ( [ eq : he ] ) decreases linearly with @xmath0 and hence the quality of the channel estimate deteriorates .",
    "since the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , the effective signal - to - noise ratio decays as @xmath54 leading to the observed result .",
    "proposition [ lemma : bitenergylow ] shows the impact of this behavior on the energy - per - bit , and indicates that it is extremely energy - inefficient to operate at very low @xmath0 values .",
    "the result holds regardless of the size of the block length @xmath3 as long as it is finite .",
    "we further conclude that in a training - based scheme where the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , the minimum energy per bit is achieved at a nonzero @xmath0 value .",
    "this most energy - efficient operating point can be obtained by numerical analysis .",
    "we can easily compute @xmath56 in ( [ eq : worstcap ] ) , and hence the bit energy values .",

    "as predicted , for each block length value , the minimum bit energy is achieved at nonzero @xmath0 , and the bit energy requirement increases as @xmath2 .",
    "it is been noted in @xcite that training - based schemes , which assume the channel estimate to be perfect , perform poorly at very low @xmath0 values , and the exact transition point below which one should not operate in this fashion is deemed as not clear .",
    "here , we propose the @xmath0 level at which the minimum bit energy is achieved as a transition point since operating below this point results in higher bit energy requirements .",

    "since most of the well - known codes are designed to correct errors that occur independently from the location of other errors @xcite , practical communication systems employ interleavers at the transmitters to gain protection against error bursts .",

    "we observe that the capacity values increase with the block length even though the channel in ( [ eq : dataphasemodelinterl ] ) is memoryless .",
    "this performance gain should be attributed to the fact that the channel estimate improves with increasing block length .",
    "[ fig : capinterl ] also plots the capacity of the interleaved noncoherent communications in which no attempt is made to learn the channel . from the comparison of the capacity curves , we observe that training significantly enhances the data rates when data symbols are interleaved at the transmitter . in fig .",
