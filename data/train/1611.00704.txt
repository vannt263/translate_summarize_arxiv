    "a _ wban _ is a wireless short range communication network formed of a coordinator denoted by _ crd _ and multiple low power and miniaturized sensors that are placed inside or attached to the human body .",
    "these sensors collect health related data through continual monitoring of the physiological state of the body , while , a person is sitting , walking , running , etc . _ _ wban__s are used in various applications such as ubiquitous health care , sports and military @xcite .",
    "for example , these sensors may be observing the heart ( electrocardiography ) and the brain electrical ( electroencephalographs ) activities as well as vital signs and parameters like insulin percentage in blood , blood pressure , temperature , etc .",
    "recently , the ieee 802.15.6 standard @xcite has proposed new specifications for _ _ wban__s that require the system to function properly within the transmission range of up to 3 meters when up to 10 _",
    "_ wban__s are collocated .",
    "it also has to support 60 sensors in a @xmath0 space ( 256 sensors in a @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , there is great possibility of interference amongst the collocated _ _",
    "wban__s , e.g. , in crowded areas such as a hospital lobby or corridor .",
    "consequently , the interference may affect the communication links and degrade the performance of each individual _ wban_. therefore , interference mitigation is of the utmost importance to improve the reliability of the whole network . to this end",
    ", the ieee standard proposes three mechanisms for co - channel interference mitigation in _ _",
    "wban__s , namely , beacon shifting , channel hopping and active superframe interleaving .",
    "in addition , the co - channel interference is challenging due to the highly mobile and resource constrained nature of _ _ wban__s .",
    "firstly , such nature makes the allocation of a global _ crd _ to manage multiple _",
    "_ wban__s as well as the application of advanced antenna and power control techniques used in other networks unsuitable for _ _ wban__s . secondly , due to the absence of coordination and synchronization among _ _",
    "wban__s , the different superframes may overlap and the concurrent transmissions of different nearby _ _",
    "wban__s may interfere . more specifically ,",
    "when two or more sensors of different _",
    "_ wban__s access the shared channel at the same time , their transmissions cause medium access collision . in this paper",
    ", we tackle these issues and contribute the following :    * _ dail , a distributed scheme that enables predictable time - based channel hopping using latin rectangles in order to avoid interference among coexisting _ _",
    "wban__s _ * _ an analytical model that derives bounds on the collision probability for sensors transmissions _    the simulation results and theoretical analysis show that our proposed approach can significantly lower the number of collisions among the individual sensors of coexisting _ _ wban__s as well as increase the power savings at both _",

    "the problem of interference due to _ _",
    "wban__s coexistence has been addressed through spectrum allocation , cooperation , power control , game theory and multiple access schemes .",
    "example schemes that pursue the spectrum allocation methodology include @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a distributed spectrum allocation is proposed where inter-__wban__s coordination is considered , the interfering sensors belonging to each pair of _ _ wban__s are assigned orthogonal sub - channels . whereas , movassaghi et al .",
    ", @xcite have proposed an adaptive interference mitigation scheme that operates on different parameters ( e.g. , nodes traffic priority , signal strength , etc , ) and allocates synchronous and parallel transmission intervals for interference avoidance .",
    "the proposed scheme has considered sensor - level interference for inter - network interference mitigation rather than considering each _ wban _ as a whole . in the proposed _",
    "scheme , we have considered the interference at both sensor- and time - slot - levels . meanwhile , in @xcite , a prediction algorithm for dynamic channel allocation is proposed where , variations in channel assignment due to body gesture movements are factored in .",
    "the interference is avoided due to the allocation of transmission time based on synchronised clocks .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite latin squares are used in cellular networks for the sub - carrier allocations to users where , a user could be allocated multiple virtual channels .",
    "each virtual channel hops over different sub - carriers at different orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) symbol times .",
    "basically , users are allocated multiple sub - carrier - to - ofdm - symbol - time combinations to avoid inter - cell interference .",
    "_ dail _ sensors assigns single - channel - to - time - slot combination which simplifies inter-_wban _ coordination and time synchronisation .",
    "a number of approaches have adopted cooperative communication , game theory and power control to mitigate co - channel interference .",
    "dong et al . , @xcite have pursued joint a cooperative communication integrated with transmit power control based on simple channel predication for _ _",
    "wban__s coexistence problem .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , a co - channel interference is mitigated using cooperative orthogonal channels and a contention window extension mechanism . whereas , the approach of @xcite employs a bayesian game based power control to mitigate inter-_wban _ interference by modelling _ _ wban__s as players and active links as types of players .",
    "other approaches pursued multiple access schemes for interference mitigation .",
    "kim et al . , @xcite have proposed a distributed _ tdma_-based beacon interval shifting scheme where , the wake up period of a _ wban _ is made to not overlap with other _ _",

    "many topology - dependent transmission scheduling algorithms have been proposed to minimize the _",
    "frame length in multihop packet radio networks using _ galois field theory _ and _ latin squares_. for single - channel networks , the _ modified galois field design _ and the _ latin square design _ for topology - transparent broadcast scheduling is proposed .",
    "the _ modified galois field design _ obtains much smaller _ minimum frame length _ than the existing scheme while the _ latin square design _ can even achieve possible performance gain when compared with the _ modified galois field design_. in one - hop rather than multi - hop communication scheme , like _ dail _ , using latin squares better schedules the medium access and consequently significantly diminishes the inter-_wban _ interference .    in this paper",
    ", we take a step forward and exploit the _ 16 _ channels available in the _ 2.4 ghz _ unlicensed international band ( _ ism _ ) of _ zigbee _ and , propose a distributed scheme based on channel and time - slot hopping for interference avoidance amongst coexisting _ _",

    "meanwhile , we depend on the special properties of latin rectangles to minimize the probability of both time and channel matching among sensors in different _ _ wban__s .",

    "sr _ and generates its data based on a predefined sampling rate and transmits data at maximum rate of _",
    "250kb / s _ within the _ 2.4 ghz _ _ ism _ band .",
    "furthermore , we assume all _ _ crd__s are equipped with unconstrained energy supply , e.g. , equipped with harvesters , and are not affected by channel hopping .    due to the _ wban _ s irregular and unpredictable motion pattern",
    ", it is very hard to achieve inter-__wban__s coordination or to have a central unit to mitigate the potential interference when some of them are in proximity of each other .",

    "the orthogonality property of latin rectangles avoids inter-_wban _ interference by allowing each sensor _ sr _ , to have its unique transmission pattern that does not resemble the pattern of sensors of other _",

    "generally , the sum of number of samples for all sensors in a time period determines the frame size .",
