    "<S> we describe and experimentally demonstrate a technique for deterministic coupling between a photonic crystal ( pc ) nanocavity and single emitters . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based on in - situ scanning of a pc cavity over a sample and allows the positioning of the cavity over a desired emitter with nanoscale resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the power of the technique , which we term a scanning cavity microscope ( scm ) , is demonstrated by coupling the pc nanocavity to a single nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond , an emitter system that provides optically accessible electron and nuclear spin qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> optical resonators enable large amplification of small optical signals , resulting in a range of spectroscopic and sensing applications , and have allowed for detection of single atoms@xcite , molecules @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they enable a controllable coupling between optical emitters and the cavity vacuum field that is critical for efficient light sources @xcite and for the realization of memory nodes in quantum networks @xcite and quantum repeaters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling strength scales with the cavity mode volume @xmath0 as @xmath1 , and consequently , nanoscale photonic crystal ( pc ) cavities have been explored extensively in solid - state cavity qed applications . while much progress has been achieved in coupling quantum dots to pc cavities made from the host material @xcite , extending these techniques to fully deterministic coupling and to other material systems has been difficult . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , there has been much recent interest in coupling pc resonators to nv centers @xcite , a promising single photon emitter with excellent electronic and nuclear spin memory @xcite , though experimental demonstrations have remained a challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a technique for deterministic positioning of micron - scale pc slabs that support high quality factor ( @xmath2 ) cavity modes with nanometer - scale features . </S>",
    "<S> when such a cavity is scanned over the sample , it can be used for deterministically coupling to optically active systems with sub - wavelength resolution via the evanescent field . by appropriate design of pc cavities and waveguides , </S>",
    "<S> these systems combine sub - wavelength resolution , high throughput , and cavity - enhanced sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they can be deterministically interfaced with isolated optical emitters .    in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the pc consists of a triangular lattice of air holes in a gallium phosphide ( gap ) membrane , creating an optical bandgap that confines light in the slab to a cavity region . </S>",
    "<S> the bandgap along the @xmath3 crystal direction is shown in the dispersion diagram in figure [ fig : setup](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> confinement in the vertical direction occurs through total internal reflection ( tir ) for modes with frequencies below the air light - line indicated in figure [ fig : setup](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a row of missing holes supports band modes which form bound cavity states when terminated on two sides . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a three - hole defect cavity @xcite whose geometry is optimized for use on a poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) substrate with a refractive index of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the tir - confined region in k - space is smaller on top of the pmma , as sketched in figure [ fig : setup](a ) , but simulations indicate that the @xmath2 value can still be above @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity has a mode volume @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the refractive index of gap at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental mode of the pc cavity is depicted by its energy density in figure [ fig : setup](c ) . the cross section in figure [ fig : setup](b ) shows the evanescent tail of the mode that couples to emitters .    </S>",
    "<S> we fabricate gap pc nanocavities by a combination of electron beam lithography and dry etching @xcite of a 108 membrane of gap on top of a 940-thick sacrificial layer of a al@xmath9ga@xmath10p . </S>",
    "<S> a wet etch removes the sacrificial layer , leaving free - standing photonic crystal membranes . </S>",
    "<S> the scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of a resulting pc nanocavity is shown in figure [ fig : setup](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> reflectivity measurements of freestanding cavities indicate that quality factors ( q ) of these cavities can exceed @xmath11 , the maximum value that can be measured with the resolution of our spectrometer ( figure [ fig : setup](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the remainder of this paper we will study cavities with typical @xmath2 values below 1000 , since these were more reliably fabricated in large numbers , permitting systematic studies . to transfer cavities , </S>",
    "<S> we press the gap chip against a flexible polymer layer of polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) , which separates the pc membranes from the chip while preserving their arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> the adhesion between the membranes and the pdms is weak enough so that the gap structures can be stamped onto the sample that is to be imaged , as shown in figure [ fig : setup](e ) . in our demonstration , </S>",
    "<S> the sample consists of @xmath12 nm diamond nanocrystals that are dispersed on a glass slide covered by a @xmath13 thick layer of pmma , for which the transfer process succeeds with @xmath14 probability for each membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is mounted in a scanning confocal microscope with an oil immersion lens . a tungsten tip with radius @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> is used to scan and position a pc nanocavity with nanometer resolution ( figure [ fig : setup](g ) ) .    .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:2](a ) shows a room - temperature photoluminescence ( pl ) image of a typical sample ( red signal ) obtained by scanning a green excitation laser across the surface with galvanometric mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> the pl spots in the image correspond to single or clusters of nv centers in diamond nanocrystals . </S>",
    "<S> the pc nanocavity can be located with the excitation laser reflection ( green in figure [ fig:2](a ) ) as well as weak fluorescence originating from impurities in gap and pmma ( green curve in figure [ fig:2](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pc fluorescence clearly shows two resonances at @xmath16 and @xmath17 with quality factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> these quality factors are rather low because of variabilities in the fabrication ; we saw no degradation due to the transfer onto the pmma substrate . by collecting spectra at different points within the cavity </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify peak @xmath20 as the fundamental mode depicted in figure [ fig : setup](c ) and peak @xmath21 as two nearly degenerate , oppositely polarized higher - order modes of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the technique and results of the spatially resolved cavity spectrum are discussed in appendix [ sec : cavity_modes ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we achieve deterministic coupling between the nv and the nanocavity by first selecting a ` target ' nv ( indicated in figure [ fig:2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this center exhibits a broad spectrum @xmath22 ( figure [ fig:2](c ) ) , which is characteristic of nv centers and results from a broad phonon sideband extending from @xmath23 640 to 800 nm . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the emission exhibits a strongly anti - bunched autocorrelation ( inset ) , indicating that it results from a single emitter . to couple this emitter to the cavity </S>",
    "<S> , we position the pc membrane over the target nv using the tungsten tip . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure [ fig:2](d ) , the pl spectrum @xmath24 changes dramatically and shows strong peaks on resonance with the cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities of these peaks are far higher than the cavity background , @xmath25 . moreover , the autocorrelation of the coupled nv - cavity system is again strongly anti - bunched ( figure [ fig:2](d ) ) , indicating that it is driven by emission of the nv center . </S>",
    "<S> we also verified the electronic triplet state of the coupled nv by electron spin resonance measurements , as shown in appendix [ sec : spin ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the se rate of an nv center is also modified by the presence of the pc slab . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , figures [ fig:2](e ) and ( f ) show that the lifetimes of the uncoupled and coupled nv centers are @xmath26 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the pl spectra on and off the pc coupled with lifetime measurements allow the determination of the spectrally resolved se rate enhancement , @xmath27 , of the coupled emitter via the relation @xmath28 ( see appendix [ sec : purcell ] ) : the analysis of the data in figure [ fig:2 ] yields @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the full curve @xmath27 is plotted in the appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we next demonstrate the spatial resolution of our method . by monitoring the fluorescence spectrum while scanning the cavity over the nv , we can map out the near - field emitter - cavity coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig 3(a - e ) , where we scan the cavity along its longitudinal ( x - axis ) over the sample in 3.4 nm steps . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(f ) presents a series of pl spectra acquired as the cavity moves over the emitter , and reveals an intensity oscillation with a period corresponding to one pc lattice spacing , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this oscillation corresponds to the spatially dependent se modification , which is directly proportional to the cavity s electric field intensity .    to analyze our observations , we note that the fluorescence of the coupled nv - cavity system is given by the emission directly from the nv , the emission through the cavity , and interference between the two : @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 determine the relative contributions of the nv , the cavity , and their interference , respectively , which depend on the collection geometry and coupling to the collection fiber . this relation is derived in appendix [ sec : spont_emission_mod ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 gives the lorentzian line shape of the cavity resonance at @xmath37 with linewidth @xmath38 , and @xmath39 accounts for the phase difference at the collection point between the direct nv emission and the emission through the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath40 is the se rate enhancement of transitions in the phonon sideband of the nv with respect to the background emission rate into non - cavity modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 can be estimated from our experimental data as follows . </S>",
    "<S> because of the high numerical aperture of our objective , nearly half of the emission from the cavity and the nv is collected : this observation suggests @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> when the signal is collected through a single - mode fiber , the interference term represented by @xmath35 becomes important and results in fano - like features in the spectrum ( see appendix [ sec : single_mode_scan ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the interference term vanishes when a multi - mode fiber is used , and we can set @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> . a fit of eq.[eq : s ] to the spectrum in figure [ fig:2](d ) then yields @xmath43 .    since the signal in figure [ fig:3](f ) is proportional to @xmath44 , we can now use eq.[eq : s ] to compare the measured cavity signal to theory . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:3](g ) plots the fitted values of @xmath45 for the fundamental cavity mode frequency @xmath46 , as shown in the red crosses . by comparing the experimental @xmath45 values to predictions for the cavity mode </S>",
    "<S> , we find a match between experiment and theory for an nv dipole @xmath47 that is @xmath48 from the pc surface , as expected from the pmma thickness , and at an angle of @xmath49 to the @xmath50-axis , obtained from the best fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> for these conditions , the predicted value of se rate modification corresponds to the track graphed in figure [ fig:3](h ) , in good agreement with experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> a small discrepancy in the fit at @xmath51 results primarily from positional slip of the pc cavity that can build up during the scan , a problem which could be improved by rigidly attaching the membrane to a stiffer scanning tip . the high spatial resolution and frequency - selective modification of spontaneous emission opens new possibilities for efficient interfacing of promising solid state qubits via optical fields . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , while the nv center is a promising system for quantum information processing , only the emission occurring into the zero phonon line ( zpl ) is suitable for coherent optical manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency - selective emission enhancement demonstrated here potentially allows us to direct most of the emission of the selected nv centers into the zpl . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the hybrid approach is compatible with narrow linewidth nv emitters in bulk diamond at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the door for applications ranging from quantum repeaters to single photon nonlinear optics . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , although we have focused here on nv centers , our scanning technique provides a ` cavity qed interface ' that can be of use to a broad range of solid state qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the pc scanning technique can serve as a new imaging approach with sub - wavelength resolution and high throughput , which we term a scanning cavity microscope ( scm ) . unlike other near - field probes that compromise the signal intensity to achieve high spatial resolution </S>",
    "<S> , scm enables large count rates : in the demonstration shown here , we record up to @xmath52 photons / s from a single nv , exceeding collection rates reported to date with far field optics . </S>",
    "<S> this can be further improved by efficiently out - coupling through cavity - coupled waveguides . in addition , the spatial resolution of the scm is determined by the feature size of the confined field , which is @xmath53 for this cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this in - plane resolution may be improved substantially using cavity modes with small feature sizes , as in slot - waveguide cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these qualities make the scm a promising tool for label - free single molecule studies @xcite or high - resolution studies of local index variations in thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a scan acquired by moving the photonic crystal membrane across the surface may need to be de - convolved by the response function of the cavity mode , as described in appendix [ sec : general_samples ] . beyond high resolution and throughput </S>",
    "<S> , the scm adds the capability to modify the spontaneous emission rate to near - field microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this opens new possibilities for direct investigations of decay channels of optical emitters , such as light emitting diodes or fluorophores ; for instance , by monitoring the emission intensity while effecting a known change in the radiative emission rate , the relative nonradiative recombation rate may be inferred , allowing a direct estimate of the radiative quantum efficiency of the material . </S>"
