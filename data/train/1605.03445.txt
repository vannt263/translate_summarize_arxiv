    "we focus on the one - dimensional case , i.e.  @xmath14 ( we order the sites @xmath8 s in increasing order , with @xmath15 ) , and study the effect of applying an external field .",
    "this corresponds to modifying the above jump rates @xmath16 by a factor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 has to be interpreted as the intensity of the external field .",
    "moreover , we generalize the form of the jump rates , finally taking @xmath19 with @xmath20 a symmetric bounded function . for simplicity",

    "we point out that there are cases in which @xmath28 is not continuous in @xmath29 ( see example [ sorpresa ] in subsection [ esaedro ] ) . under the condition leading to ballisticity",
    "we also show that the markov process given by the environment viewed from the walker admits a stationary ergodic distribution @xmath30 , which is mutually absolutely continuous to the original law @xmath3 of the environment .",
    "moreover we give upper and lower bounds on the radon  nikodym derivative @xmath31 , showing that it is in @xmath32 , and we characterize the asymptotic velocity as the expectation of the local drift with respect to the measure @xmath30 ( cf .",

    "the study of ballisticity for the mott random walk is the first fundamental step towards proving the einstein relation , which states the proportionality of diffusivity and mobility of the process ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . among other important applications ,",
    "the einstein relation would allow to conclude the proof of the physical mott law , which was originally stated for the mobility of the process and has only been proved for its diffusivity ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the einstein relation will be addressed in future work .",
    "the techniques used to prove ballisticity and sub - ballisticity are different . in order to comment them it is convenient to refer to the discrete  time random walk and @xmath33 @xmath34 on @xmath35 such that @xmath36 if after @xmath37 jumps the random walk @xmath6 is at site @xmath8 .",
    "due to our assumptions on the environment , the ballistic / sub - ballistic behavior of @xmath0 is indeed the same as that of @xmath34 , and therefore we focus on the latter .",
    "we first comment the ballistic regime .",
    "considering first a generic random walk on @xmath35 starting at the origin and a.s .",
    "transient to the right , ballisticity is usually derived by proving a law of large numbers ( lln ) for the hitting times @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the first time the random walk reaches the half - line @xmath40 . in the case of nearest",
    "neighbor random walks , @xmath41 is simply the hitting time of @xmath37 , and considering an ergodic environment one can derive the lln for @xmath38 by showing that the sequence @xmath42 is stationary and mixing for the annealed law as in @xcite .",
    "this technique can not be applied in the present case , since our random walk has infinite range and much information about the environment to the right is known , when a site in @xmath40 is visited for the first time .",
    "a very useful tool is the method developed in @xcite where the authors have studied ballisticity for a class of random walks on @xmath35 with arbitrarily long jumps .",
    "their strategy is as follows .",
    "first one introduces for any positive integer @xmath43 a truncated random walk obtained from the original one by forbidding all jumps of length larger than @xmath43 .",
    "the ergodicity of the environment and the finite range of the jumps allow to introduce a regenerative structure related to the times @xmath44 , and to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath43truncated random walk .",
    "in particular , one proves that the environment viewed from the @xmath43truncated random walk admits a stationary ergodic distribution @xmath45 which is mutually absolutely continuous to the original law of the environment .",
    "a basic ingredient here is the theory of cycle  stationarity and cycle  ergodicity ( cf .",
    "* chapter 8) and @xcite for an example in a simplified setting ) .",
    "finally , one proves that the sequence @xmath46 converges weakly to a probability distribution @xmath30 , which is indeed a stationary and ergodic distribution for the environment viewed from the random walker @xmath47 and is also mutually absolutely continuous to the law of the environment @xmath3 .",
    "since , as usual , the random walk can be written as an additive functional of the environment viewed from the random walker , one can apply birkhoff s ergodic theorem and use the ergodicity of @xmath30 to get the strong lln for the random walk ( hence its asymptotic velocity ) for @xmath30a.e .  environment .",
    "using the fact that @xmath48 , the above strong lln holds for @xmath3a.e .",
    "environment , too .",
    "finally , since the velocities of the @xmath43truncated walks are uniformly bounded from below by a strictly positive constant and since they converge to the velocity of @xmath47 when @xmath49 , we obtain a ballistic behavior .    to analyze ballisticity",
    "we have used the same method as in @xcite , although one can not apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 2.3 , 2.4 ) directly to the present case , since some hypotheses are not satisfied in our context . in particular , in @xcite three conditions ( called e , c , d ) are assumed , and only condition @xmath50 is satisfied by our model . by means of estimates based on capacity theory , we are able to extend the method developed in @xcite to the present case .",
    "we now move to sub - ballisticity ( the regime of zero velocity is not covered in @xcite and our method could be in principle applied to random walks on @xmath35 with arbitrarily long jumps ) .",
    "we define a coupling between the random walk @xmath51 , a sequence of suitable @xmath52valued i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath53 with finite mean , and an ergodic sequence of random variables @xmath54 with the following properties : fix @xmath55 and call now @xmath56 the first time the random walk overjumps the point @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is a geometric random variable of parameter @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the usual shift and @xmath61 a deterministic function .",
    "the coupling guarantees that @xmath62 does not exceed @xmath63 and also ensures that the time @xmath64 is larger than @xmath58 .",
    "notice that @xmath65 and therefore the sub - ballisticity of @xmath66 follows from the lln for @xmath67 and the lln for @xmath68 , since our assumption @xmath25=\\infty\\,$ ] implies that @xmath69 = + \\infty$ ] .      in section [ notazione ]",
