    "the magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke)@xcite , manifested by a rotation of a linear polarization plane of the light reflected from the magnetized material s surface , provides an excellent tool for probing of metals@xcite or dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms)@xcite magnetization .",
    "the dmss have been intensively studied recently@xcite due to a wide range of valuable functionalities resulting from a combination of properties inherent for a semiconductor and for a magnetic material . in particular",

    "the mcd , the moke results generally from a difference in the absorption of the left- and the right - circularly polarized light in the magnetized material . in the case of the dms , the moke in the fundamental gap spectral region originates from a splitting of interband transitions in magnetic field induced by spin - orbit and @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange interactions between band carriers and localized spins of the magnetic dopant ions .",
    "practical applications in magneto - optical devices necessitate strong magneto - optical effects from possibly thin dms films .",
    "this could be , in principle , achieved through raising of a concentration of a magnetic dopant , _ x _ @xcite .",
    "however , optical performance of the dmss typically drops down with the increasing _ x _ @xcite .",
    "as recently shown , magneto - optical response of dms can be efficiently enhanced while keeping _",
    "x _ at a reasonably low level by boosting the light - matter interaction exploiting photonic @xcite or plasmonic @xcite effects . in particular , a significant enhancement of a faraday rotation or mcd related to",

    "we determine first a design of the structure assuring the highest degree of the moke enhancement in the fundamental gap spectral region .",
    "we find a strong impact of the fabry - perot light interferences on the moke magnitude , in contrary to the case of optically thick magnetized metal layers , where interference effects are precluded by a small light penetration depth .",
    "next , we analyze a dependence of the moke in the dms and of its enhancement on the light incidence angle .",
    "the angle dependencies of the moke has been studied so far only for magnetized metallic films @xcite .",
    "we show that with the proposed design , the moke enhancement for both , transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) , polarizations remains insensitive to the angle of the light incidence in a wide angle range .",
    "however , the maximum of moke enhancement for tm polarization is obtained for the brewster angle , similarly as in the case of magnetized metal layers @xcite .    the possibility of enhancement of the moke in ( ge",

    "the photonic approach to the moke enhancement presented here can be , however , easily applied to any , not only the wide band gap , dms .",
    "we consider a magnetooptical response of two structures : one involving a dms layer deposited on a dbr layer ( referred to as dms / dbr ) , and the other one ( dms / buffer ) serving as a reference , involving the dms layer deposited on a buffer layer ( see fig .",

    "the assumed relatively small number of periods and a low difference of al content in the layers within the dbr mirror is enough for a significant moke enhancement in dms  @xcite . at the same time , such design is advantageous from the point of view of an epitaxial growth of a good quality ( with a low dislocations density ) structures  @xcite .",

    "in this work , we consider the case of polar moke , where the magnetization vector is perpendicular to the sample reflection surface and parallel to a plane of the light incidence .",

    "the highest moke magnitude is obtained at around @xmath46 = 355 nm , where both , real and imaginary , parts of the dms refractive index exhibit sharp extrema due to a contribution to the dielectric function coming from excitonic absorption peaks  @xcite . as seen in fig .",

    "impact of the sample design is typically not taken into account when discussing the moke or other magneto - optical phenomena in observed in experiments on dms layers .",
    "the above discussion shows that moke magnitude depends not only on the properties of the dms layer itself , but also on the design of the whole structure involving the dms layer .",
    "our calculations indicate thus a possibility of interference enhancement of the moke magnitude even in the structures with no photonic crystal . moreover , a difference between the moke in dmss ( where the light penetrates the structure ) and the moke in optically thick metallic layers ( where the light probes mainly the surface ) is clearly highlighted here .     at b = 1 t versus the light wavelength , for the dms",

    "[ fig : kerr_plot_0 ] the @xmath44 for @xmath51 at b = 1 t for both , dms / dbr and dms / buffer , structures .",
    "the moke amplitude much larger in the case of the dms / dbr than the dms / buffer structure and a peak - to - peak enhancement reaching a factor of @xmath50 3 is evidenced .    we note that despite that two spectrally close ( ga , fe)n excitons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , contribute to the moke , the @xmath44 curves exhibit a lorentzian - like shape , similar as it would be in the case of a single excitonic transition  @xcite .",

    "however , a strong maximum , not present in the case of the te polarized light is observed at around @xmath541.14 rad ( @xmath5065.3 deg ) .",
    "this angle corresponds to the brewster ( polarization ) angle for the tm polarized light incident on air/(ga , fe)n layer interface .",
    "a lossless light transmission through the air / dielectric interface , conjuncted with a high bragg mirror reflectivity in the dms / dbr structure , leads to a strong phase dependence of the light on the ( ga , fe)n refractive index . as a result ,",

    "implies that through adjustment of the light polarization and the incidence angle in the vicinity of the brewster angle one can effectively control the degree of the moke enhancement in the dms .",
    "the obtained results show that magnitude of the moke in dms is not defined solely by the concentration of a magnetic dopant in the dms layer , as typically assumed , but it depends in a substantial degree also on the actual sample design .",
    "it is established that a proper interpretation of the absolute moke magnitude in dms layers requires taking into account effects of the light interference in a semiconductor structure .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically an angle dependence of enhancement of polar magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) obtained thanks to a deposition of a paramagnetic diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) layer on one - dimensional photonic crystal layer . our transfer matrix method based calculations conducted for te and tm polarizations of the incident light predict up to an order of magnitude stronger moke for a ( ga , fe)n dms layer when implementing the proposed design . the maximum enhancement for te and tm polarization occurs for the light incidence at the normal and at the brewster angle , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a possibility of tuning of the moke enhancement by adjustment of the polarization and the incidence angle of the light . </S>"
