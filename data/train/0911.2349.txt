    "with the rapid advancement in nanoscience and nanotechnology , specially in nanofabrication techniques  @xcite , study of spin dependent transport in mesoscopic  @xcite systems has emerged as one of the most challenging topics in the last few decades .",
    "analysis of spin transport and spin dynamics is essential to understand and develop the field - ` spintronics '  @xcite . with the discovery of giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) based magnetic field sensors  @xcite in 1994 , remarkable development has taken place in the field of magnetic data storage applications and quantum computation techniques . a drastic enhancement in computation time has been made possible using the idea of quantum coherence and spin entanglement .",
    "manifestation of coherence is one of the most important aspect of mesoscopic systems .",
    "it is evident from theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies of spin transport through quantum confined nanostructures that the conductance of such systems depends on the spin state of electrons passing through the system and it can be controlled by an externally applied magnetic field . but measurement of current through these @xmath1d nanostructures does not reveal the feature of quantum coherence , as it is detectable through interference experiments , most notably aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometry  @xcite . in order to study the effect of coherence ,",
    "spin dependent transport has been studied in various types of ring type conductors or two path devices  @xcite such as an ab ring or ab type interferometer with embedded quantum dots , with a magnetic flux @xmath0 penetrating the area enclosed yielding a flux dependent spin transmission probability .",
    "the study of spin dependent transport through interferometric geometries are important for further development in quantum information processing as well as for designing spin based nano - devices . the key idea of designing spin dependent nano - electronic devices is based on the concept of quantum interference effect  @xcite , and it is generally preserved throughout the sample having dimension smaller or comparable to the phase coherence length .",
    "in realistic situation , experimentally sizable rings are typically of the order of @xmath4-@xmath5 @xmath6 m .",
    "therefore , ring type conductors or two path devices are ideal candidates where the effect of quantum interference can be exploited  @xcite .    recently , spin transport through ab type interferometers with embedded quantum dots has drawn much attention because of its demonstration of several physical phenomena e.g. , quantum phase transitions , resonant tunneling and many body correlation effects .",
    "it opens a new area of study of spin transport , which includes spin dependent conductance modulation , spin filtering , spin switching , spin detecting mechanisms , etc .",
    "conductance of such mesoscopic systems is associated with the transmission probability ( @xmath7 ) of electrons , which can be calculated numerically by several methods like , mode matching techniques  @xcite , green s function approach  @xcite or transfer matrix method  @xcite .",
    "aim of the present paper is to study the spin dependent transport through an ab type interferometric geometry made up of magnetic atomic sites .",
    "the interferometer , threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath0 , is attached symmetrically to two @xmath1d semi - infinite non - magnetic electrodes .",
    "a simple tight - binding hamiltonian is used to describe the system where all the calculations are done using transfer matrix formalism .",
    "spin dependent conductance is calculated using the landauer formula and also current - voltage characteristics are computed through the landauer - bttiker formalism  @xcite .",
    "we explore several important features of spin transport with this simple , yet interesting geometry .",
    "quite nicely we see that , at the half flux - quantum value of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) , the system exhibits xor gate like response depending on the orientations of the local magnetic moments in the upper and lower arms of the interferometer , that can be changed by an external magnetic field . to the best of our knowledge , the spin based xor gate response in such a simple geometry has not been addressed earlier in the literature .",

    "we will show that , depending on the values of @xmath184 and @xmath185 the interferometric geometry exhibits xor gate response , keeping all the other moments oriented along @xmath165z axis .",
    "these two ( @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) are treated as the two inputs of the xor gate .",
    "let us first discuss the case of weak - coupling ( fig .",
    "[ condlow ] ) .",
    "when both the two inputs to the gate are zero , i.e. , @xmath186 , conductance exactly drops zero ( see fig .",
    "[ condlow](a ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if any one of the two inputs is high i.e. , @xmath184 or @xmath185 has a non - zero value , the conductance shows fine resonant peaks ( see figs .  [ condlow](b ) and ( c ) ) for some particular energy values . finally , when both the inputs to the gate are high , the conductance again vanishes ( fig .",
    "[ condlow](d ) ) for the entire energy range .",
    "the conductance peaks are associated with the energy eigenvalues of the interferometer . with the increasing number of magnetic atoms , comprising the interferometer , number of energy levels associated with the interferometer increases ,",
    "therefore more resonant peaks appear in the conductance spectrum .",
    "these features can be explained as follows .",
    "when both the two inputs are either low ( @xmath187 ) or high ( @xmath188 ) , the transmission probability exactly vanishes at the half flux - quantum    value of @xmath0 which provides zero conductance for the entire energy range .",
    "the vanishing behavior of conductance at @xmath2 for these symmetric configurations of the interferometer is clearly understood from our earlier discussion ( sub - section iii@xmath189a ) if the symmetry in the orientation of the local magnetic moments in the two arms of the interferometer is broken by applying an external magnetic field i.e. , @xmath190 then the transmission probability becomes non - zero even at @xmath2 . since in this case @xmath184 and @xmath185 are chosen either as @xmath11 or @xmath169 , no spin flipping takes place , and therefore , the contribution to @xmath191 comes only from the factor @xmath144 .",
    "the contribution from the spin flipping to the conductance spectrum will be observed for any other values of @xmath164 ( @xmath192 ) apart from @xmath11 and @xmath169 .",
    "even for these orientations of the magnetic moments , the total conductance vanishes for the symmetric configuration , while it shows a finite non - zero value for the asymmetric one .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the xor gate like response will remain unchanged at the typical ab flux @xmath2 for any value of @xmath164 . in this interferometric geometry",
    "the asymmetry can be quantified by the term @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "the logical xor gate response is obtained for any non - zero value of @xmath193 , while it is best observed for the maximum value of @xmath193 ( @xmath195 ) , which is presented in our case .",
    "another important thing to be mentioned here is that for @xmath168 or @xmath169 , spin flip transmission does not take place , and accordingly , the spin transfer torque @xmath196 is zero which does not affect the magnetization direction , while for any other values of @xmath164 apart from @xmath11 and @xmath169 , @xmath196 is nonzero which may cause a change in the direction of magnetization . but",
    "the change will be the same for all the magnetic sites having identical magnetic moments and hence xor gate feature will not get affected .",
    "thus we can conclude that the violation    of spin conservation due to spin flip scattering should not have any significant impact on xor gate response . in short",
    ", we can say that the spin transmission probability becomes non - zero if and only if the moments embedded in the interferometric arms are oriented asymmetrically .",
    "our numerical results clearly justify the xor gate response .    in the same footing , here we also present the conductance - energy characteristics for the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ condhigh ] .",
    "all the basic features in the four different choices of the two inputs ( @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) are exactly similar to those as presented in fig .",
    "[ condlow ] , apart from the broadening of conductance peaks .",
    "the contribution to the broadening comes from the broadening of the energy levels of the interferometer in this strong - coupling limit .",
    "it provides a significant effect in the study of current - voltage ( @xmath9-@xmath10 ) characteristics which we will describe in the following sub - section .",
    "it is to be noted that the conductance - energy spectrum for down spin is exactly mirror symmetric to the spectrum observed for an up spin , and accordingly , we do not plot the results further for down spin .",
    "all the basic features of spin dependent transport obtained from conductance versus energy spectra can be explained in a better way through the current - voltage ( @xmath9-@xmath10 ) characteristics .",
    "the current across the quantum interferometer is computed by integrating over the transmission curve according to eq .",
    "( [ equ28 ] ) , where the transmission probability varies exactly similar to that of the conductance spectrum , since we get the relation @xmath197 from the landauer conductance formula ( eq .  ( [ equ27 ] ) ) with @xmath198 in our present formulation .    in figs .",
    "[ currlow ] and [ currhigh ] , we plot the current ( @xmath9 ) as a function of applied bias voltage ( @xmath10 ) both for the symmetric and asymmetric orientations of the    local magnetic moments in the upper and lower arms of the interferometer .",
    "the flux @xmath0 is set at @xmath183 i.e. , @xmath134 in our chosen unit .",
    "let us first start with the case of weak - coupling ( fig .",
    "[ currlow ] ) . for symmetric configuration of the interferometric arms ( @xmath186 and @xmath199 ) , the current vanishes for the entire range of the bias voltage @xmath10 ( figs .",
    "[ currlow](a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for these cases the transmission probability becomes zero for the entire energy range as we have studied earlier . on the other hand , for asymmetric configuration ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) of the interferometric arms , the current is non - zero ( figs .",
    "[ currlow](b ) and ( c ) ) , because of non - vanishing spin transmission probability .",
    "this behavior becomes much more clearer from table  [ table1 ] , where we make a quantitative estimate of typical current amplitude , computed at the bias voltage @xmath204 .",
    "it is observed that , the current @xmath9 reaches the value to @xmath205 only when any one of the two inputs are high and the other is low i.e. , ( @xmath200 and @xmath201 or @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) , while for the other two cases ( @xmath200 and @xmath203 or @xmath202 and @xmath201 ) , it ( @xmath9 ) gets zero . from these @xmath9-@xmath10 characteristics the xor gate like response",
    "is clearly visualized . in this weak - coupling limit , the current shows step - like behavior as a function of the applied     +    .xor gate behavior in the limit of weak - coupling .",
    "the typical current amplitude is determined at the bias voltage @xmath204 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     interferometer from the source to drain .",
    "incorporation of a single discrete energy level i.e. , a discrete quantized conduction channel , between the range @xmath206 provides a jump in the @xmath9-@xmath10 characteristics .",
    "the case of strong - coupling is depicted in fig .",
    "[ currhigh ] .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the current is given in table  [ table2 ] , where the typical current is measured for the bias voltage @xmath204 .",
    "in this strong - coupling limit , all the basic features are exactly similar to that given in table  [ table1 ] , only the magnitude of the output current gets enhanced to a value of @xmath207 .",
    "the non - zero currents show continuum behavior with respect to the change in bias voltage . as the sharp and discrete feature of the conductance peaks",
    "is lost in this strong - coupling limit , acquiring some broadening , the current changes continuously providing a much larger amplitude .",
    "therefore , tuning the strength of the interferometer - to - electrode coupling , current can be enhanced significantly keeping the bias voltage constant",
    ". exactly similar kind of behavior can also be observed for down spin current , and accordingly , we do not show the results here .",
    "to summarize , in the present work we have explored spin dependent transport through interferometric geometry , penetrated by a magnetic flux @xmath0 using transfer matrix formalism . a simple tight - binding framework has been adopted to illustrate the system , where the interferometer comprised of magnetic atomic sites is sandwiched between two non - magnetic electrodes , namely , source and drain .",
    "we have calculated numerically the spin dependent transmission probability including the effect of spin - flip .",
    "our numerical calculations describe conductance - energy and current - voltage characteristics as functions of the interferometer - to - electrode coupling strength , magnetic flux and the orientation of the local magnetic moments associated with each atom placed in interferometric arms .",
    "first , we have observed the variation of conductance incorporating the effect of spin flip , as a function of magnetic flux @xmath0 showing @xmath150 periodicity . it is noticed that , at half flux - quantum value of @xmath0 , transmission probability drops to zero for a symmetrically connected interferometer .",
    "next , we have studied the variation of conductance with @xmath164 ( considering @xmath208 ) for symmetric configuration which shows that spin flipping is blocked for @xmath168 or any integer multiple of @xmath169 .",
    "finally , we have obtained xor gate like response in @xmath162-@xmath163 and @xmath9-@xmath10 characteristics depending on the orientations of the local magnetic moments in the upper and lower arms of the interferometer at @xmath2 .    throughout our work",
    ", we have addressed all the essential features of xor gate operation considering an interferometer with total @xmath44 atomic sites . among them",
    "@xmath42 are placed at the corners to form a ring like structure and the rest two are coupled to the electrodes directly . in our model calculations , this typical number ( @xmath44 ) is chosen only for the sake of simplicity .",
    "though the results presented here change numerically with the ring size , but all the basic features remain exactly invariant . the main point of concern is that , whether the moments in the upper and lower interferometric arms are oriented symmetrically or not .",
    "the local magnetization direction can be changed by a rotation of the exchange field on the magnetic sites  @xcite .",
    "change of the local moment orientations at sites @xmath1 , @xmath43 , @xmath42 and @xmath44 in our present geometric model does not make any difference to the physical features of the results shown above . to be more specific",
    ", it is important to note that , in real situation the experimentally achievable rings have typical diameters within the range @xmath4-@xmath5 @xmath6 m .",
    "in such a small ring , unrealistically very high magnetic fields are required to produce a quantum flux .",
    "to overcome this situation , hod _ et al .",
    "_ have studied extensively and proposed how to construct nanometer scale devices , based on aharonov - bohm interferometry , those can be operated in moderate magnetic fields  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we have calculated all the results by ignoring the effects of temperature , electron - electron correlation , electron - phonon interaction , disorder , etc . here",
    "we fix the temperature at @xmath11k , but the basic features will not change significantly even in non - zero finite ( low ) temperature region as long as thermal energy ( @xmath209 ) is less than the average energy spacing of the energy levels of the quantum interferometer . over the last few years a lot of efforts",
    "are made to incorporate the effect of electron - electron correlation in the study of spin dependent transport .",
    "electronic correlation may cause decoherence among the waves passing through the interferometric arms .",
    "but , at low temperatures the decoherence produced by electron - electron correlation can be limited and in a very recent work montambaux _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have justified it by studying electron transport for some arrays of connected mesoscopic metallic rings in presence of electronic correlation .",
    "the presence of electron - phonon interaction in aharonov - bohm interferometers provides phase shifts of the conducting electrons and due to this dephasing process electron transport through an ab interferometer becomes highly sensitive to the ab flux @xmath0 with the increase of electron - phonon coupling strength  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have addressed our results considering the site energies of all the atomic sites of the interferometer are identical i.e. , we have treated the ordered system .",
    "but in real case , the presence of impurities will destroy phase coherence significantly which affects the transport properties . in this model",
    "it is also assumed that the two side - attached non - magnetic electrodes have negligible resistance . at the end",
    ", we would like to mention that we need further study in such systems by incorporating all these effects .    at the end , here we have designed a spin xor gate using a quantum interferometer , based on the effect of quantum interference , which is a classical logic gate . on the other hand , quantum logic gates using ring geometries have already been proposed earlier which can be available in the reference  @xcite .",
