    "the variance can also be subject to mutation , meaning that it is part of the _ genetic code _ of the population .",
    "every solution is evaluated by the objective function and one or some of them selected to be the next _ progenitors _ , allowing the search to go on , stopping when some criteria is met . in this paper",
    "we use a recent convergence result proved by a.  auger in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the log - linear convergence is achieved for the optimization problems we investigate here , and depends on the number @xmath3 of search points .",
    "usually optimal control problems are approximately solved by means of numerical techniques based on the gradient vector or the hessian matrix @xcite . compared with these techniques , es",

    "we are interested in two classical problems of the calculus of variations : the 1696 brachistochrone problem and the 1687 newton s aerodynamical problem of minimal resistance ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these two problems , although classical , are source of strong current research on optimal control and provide many interesting and challenging open questions @xcite .",
