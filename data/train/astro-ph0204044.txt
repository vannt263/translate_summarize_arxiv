    "interstellar dust is poorly understood in spite of its importance within galaxies .",
    "the mean extinction law ( i.e. scattering plus absorption ) for the diffuse galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) is reasonably well known , but the individual absorption and scattering properties are still controversial .",
    "many other basic properties ( chemical composition , particle size distribution , particle shape distribution , alignment of the grains in the magnetic field , and others ) are also poorly known .",
    "the properties of dust for each scattering event are characterized by two parameters : @xmath5 , the albedo or fraction of the extinction that is scattering , and @xmath6 , the mean cosine of the scattering angle , averaged over the phase function for single scattering .",
    "geometrical uncertainties prevent the determination of higher moments of the scattering pattern beyond these two .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are estimated from either reflection nebulae excited by a central star , radiation from a dusty globule reflecting galactic light , or the  diffuse galactic light \" ( dgl ) , the general stellar radiation reflected by the dust distributed throughout the ism .",
    "almost always , nebulae have been interpreted with smooth ( non - clumpy ) models , sometimes with a density gradient .",
    "radiation transfer differs in smooth and clumpy media because photons can escape between the clumps .",
    "uniformity was a reasonable assumption , for three reasons .",
    "( a ) it is the simplest , and occam s razor has great appeal .",
    "( b ) hierarchical clumping had not been convincingly demonstrated by several means .",
    "( c ) the computational resources required for radiative transport through hierarchical clumps have only recently become widely available .",
    "any estimate of the albedo is affected by the hierarchical clumping of the ism .",
    "these clumps occur on scales from au to tens or hundreds of parsecs , as observed in various molecules ( co , formaldehyde , and oh ) , ionic species , h  i , and 100@xmath7 m ( crovisier & dickey 1983 ; green 1993 ; moore & marscher 1995 ; vogelaar & wakker 1994 ; elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ; abergel et al . 1996 ; elmegreen 1997 ; heiles 1997 ; heithausen et al .",

    "we have examined the images in the simbad database of the reflection nebulae with which we are acquainted ( about a dozen ) ; all appear to be clumpy .",
    "the observed thermal pressure in the ism as judged from c  i ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ) varies by over an order of magnitude within a sample of stars against which the column densities of c  i lines can be determined .",
    "the hierarchical structure of the ism is a natural consequence of turbulence , which is scale - free .",
    "turbulent models of the ism generate hierarchical density structure ( e.g. , norman & ferrera 1996 ) .",
    "boiss ( 1990 ) determined the transport of radiation through a two - phased clumpy medium with isotropic scattering .",
    "witt & gordon ( 1996 ) extended the calculations to anisotropic scattering in a centrally illuminated sphere .",
    "they investigated the effects of changing various parameters such as the contrast between the density contrast between the phases or the sizes of the clumps relative to the radius of the sphere .",
    "many of the qualitative effects we find from varying parameters for hierarchical models are discussed by them as well .",
    "as the volume fraction of the dense phase was increased , their models varied from widely separated dense clumps up to continuous structures with small holes .",
    "since all cells have either of two densities , we will refer to this type of clumping as `` two - phase models '' .",
    "by contrast , our hierarchical models have an almost continuous distribution of densities .",
    "witt & gordon ( 2000 ) have investigated radiative transfer in galaxies by means of a specific two - phased ism , one being 100 times as dense as the other and occupying 15% of the volume . in order to compare with hierarchical",
    ", we adopt this recipe , with 16 cells along the radius of the sphere ( witt & gordon used 15 ) .",
    "all of our assumed ( @xmath8 = ( 0.6,0.6 ) , which are values typical for optical wavelengths suggested by observations ( see plots in witt & gordon 2000 ) .",
    "the fact that the ism is _ hierarchically _ clumped is important for the propagation of scattered light , since such a structure has relatively open spaces through which the radiation can move rather freely .",
    "the main thrust of this paper is not to try to put limits on the grain properties of real reflection nebulae , but to show the _ variation _ among hierarchical models as they are viewed from various angles",
    ". we will not be very concerned with the averaged properties of the models , since each real object is viewed from only one direction .",
    "the density structure of the ism is often described as  fractal \" , meaning self - similar on all size scales .",
    "we will consider models that are hierarchically clumped instead , meaning that they are self - similar over a limited range ( about a factor of ten ) in sizes .",
    "we use a procedure similar to that in elmegreen ( 1997 ) : ( a ) consider a  supercube \" , a portion of which will represent a spherical reflection nebula .",
    "the supercube of size l on a side consists of 64 cubical cells stacked along each dimension .",
    "for each cell we determine the local density of dust , as explained below .",
    "( b ) place @xmath9 points randomly within the supercube .",
    "we used @xmath9 = 32 .",
    "( c ) randomly cast another @xmath9 points , all within a distance @xmath10 in each cartesian axis from each of the points cast in the preceding round . here the distance @xmath11 is related to the `` fractal dimension '' , @xmath12 , by @xmath13 .",
    "allow any of the points that fall outside of the supercube to remain there .",
    "( d ) repeat procedure ( c ) , above , twice more , so that the total number of points cast is @xmath14 .",
    "( e ) shift the points outside of the supercube to within it by translating each cartesian coordinate outside of the supercube by @xmath15 until it lies within .",
    "this procedure reflects the points so that if they originally fall off the left side of the supercube they reappear the same distance from the right within the supercube , and correspondingly for up / down and front / back .",
    "the density within the supercube is then proportional to the number of points within each cell .",
    "( f ) inscribe a sphere within the supercube and place a point source of radiation at its center .",
    "the constant of proportionality between the number of points in each cell and the optical depth within the cell is chosen to make the radial optical depth , averaged over all directions , be .",
    "the main parameter of this procedure is @xmath12 , which describes the degree of clumping .",
    "we considered @xmath12 = 2.3 and 2.6 , in the range observed in actual clouds .",
    "another observable parameter is @xmath16 , the exponent of the power of the projection of the density within the supercube onto the plane of the sky is defined by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is its fourier transform , with @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 and * @xmath21r * are vectors , and ( @xmath22 ) cartesian coordinates , in the plane of the sky . ] , so that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the wavenumber . observations ( e.g. stanimirovi et al .",
    "1999 ) show @xmath25 . with our recipe",
    "we find @xmath26 with @xmath12 = 2.6 and @xmath27 with @xmath12 = 2.3 .",
    "however , none of the conclusions in this paper depend upon which set of hierarchical models we consider .",
    "many different models can have the same @xmath16 .",
    "no one parameter , either @xmath12 or @xmath16 , can completely describe even the projection of the density distribution of the ism onto the sky .",
    "the above procedure with the parameters we adopted results in clouds that are quite full of holes , with @xmath315% of the projected density distribution being almost blank .",
    "the large - scale ism as shown by h  i is similar if a low column density of h  i ( @xmath28 h atoms @xmath29 ) is taken to be `` blank '' ( i.e. , a column density much smaller than the average ) . elmegreen ( 1997 ) has discussed the emptiness of the ism , with the large - scale structure in mind .",
    "images of actual reflection nebulae ( see sellgren , werner , & dinerstein 1992 for ngc2023 and ngc7023 ) show strong filaments and structure , but there is material at all points within the nebula . for this reason",
    ", we sometimes add a uniform density to all cells in the supercube .",
    "this constant density does not change the value of @xmath16 , since the fourier transform of a constant is a dirac @xmath21-function at the origin , @xmath30 . choosing a constant density",
    "provides a minimum projected density .",
    "the detailed placement of the clumps of dust also influences the results of our radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the clumping is mainly formed by the first round of random casting of 32 points that are subsequently spread by three more rounds of casting points in their vicinities .",
    "the locations of the first round of points is uniquely determined by the integer seed of the random number generator , and the locations of all subsequent points follow from the initial value of this integer in a complicated but unique way .",
    "the response of the model nebula to the central star is strongly affected by the precise placement of the dust relative to the star and , thereby , to the value of the initial seed .",
    "we considered suites of models that differed only in their initial seeds .",
    "our procedure amounts to assuming that the star does not affect the density distribution of the dust in its immediate vicinity , so the initial seed is allowed to control the placement of the dust both near and far from the star . to test the sensitivity of results to this assumption",
    ", we also considered models with a cavity in the dust distribution within the inner 10% of the radius of the sphere .",
    "the radiative transfer was performed by the monte carlo code described by wood & reynolds ( 1999 ) .",
    "it involves considering photon packages propagated in a random direction from the central star .",
    "we assumed @xmath1 and @xmath2 , along with the scattering phase function of henyey & greenstein ( 1941 ) . in most cases we used @xmath31 photons for each model , after checking for a few cases that the results were the same as from a model using @xmath32 photons .",
    "unlike the situation for placing the dust , the initial seed for the radiative transfer makes no difference , as expected from such a large number of stellar photons propagated in random directions .",
    "we calculated the fluxes of scattered radiation and also of starlight , both of which depend on the angle from which the sphere is viewed because of the strong randomly placed clumping .",
    "both fluxes are expressed relative to the stellar flux that would be observed from the unobscured star .",
    "we express the fluxes as extinction and scattering optical depths , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the flux the star would have if there were no reflection nebula .",
    "each flux or optical depth depends on the direction from which the sphere is viewed .",
    "we considered 18 evenly spaced values of cos(@xmath36 ) and 36 values of @xmath37 , where @xmath36 is the polar angle of the sphere and @xmath37 the azimuthal . @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be determined directly ( with difficulty ! ) in real nebulae .",
    "@xmath40 can be determined if there is enough wavelength coverage to determine the extinction from extrapolation to large wavelengths , from colors if the reddening law is assumed , or if the total fir flux from the nebula is measured .",
    "otherwise , the ratio of the stellar to the nebular flux gives the difference of and .",
    "we now ask , how well can we determine ( @xmath41 ) from an observation of ( , ) ?",
    "as regards radiative transfer , hierarchical clumping introduces major differences from a uniform distribution or , to a lesser extent , from .",
    "the main properties of hierarchical models are :    \\(a ) when viewed from various directions , hierarchically clumped nebulae exhibit and spanning a wide range .",
    "a real reflection nebula represents viewing a collection of dust from one particular direction .",
    "we can calculate mean properties of models as averages over all viewing directions , but mean properties are relevant only if a large collection of nebulae ( such as in another galaxy ) are observed .",
    "angle - averaged properties of any model have very limited applicability for interpreting a given reflection nebula",
    ". the models of witt & gordon ( 1996 ) also show a wide range of at a given .",
    "\\(b ) as expected , the global parameters of the models , such as and @xmath12 , have a significant influence on the radiation transfer .",
    "we considered both purely hierarchical models and some with 33% of the mass in a constant density sphere upon which the clumps are superimposed .",
    "this uniform background density can have an important effect on the radiation transfer in optically thick nebulae , when the diffusion depends more upon the transparent regions than on the opaque .",
    "this rule is familiar in connection with the use of the rosseland mean opacity in the optically thick limit of radiation diffusion in stars .",
    "whether such a uniform layer exists in reflection nebulae is not clear .",
    "the regions between clumps on large ( molecular cloud ) scales have a vastly lower density than the mean ( e.g. , elmegreen 1997 ) .",
    "\\(c ) models with the same global parameters ( , @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , but differing in the placement of the dense clumps relative to the central star , show strong variations in even the averaged fluxes .",
    "there are significant differences between hierarchical models in which the star happens to lie within a dense clump of dust , in contrast to those in which it falls within a void ( or if there is a central hole ) . if the star happens to lie within a void , there are lightly reddened paths that reach from the star to the edge of the sphere",
    ". if the star is almost unattenuated as seen from a particular direction , the nebula would be interpreted as having the star in front of the dust , except that there can be a significant amount of scattered light that would not be there if the star were truly foreground . in these cases ,",
    "the albedo derived from uniform models would be @xmath42 .",

    "the always provide a smaller range in ( @xmath43 ) ( about @xmath440.12 ) than the hierarchical , but their spread in is comparable to hierarchical models at low ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the spread at large decreases because the interclump medium becomes opaque , so that in the ultraviolet ( uv ) make a prediction of @xmath1 that is rather independent of viewing angle .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows plotted against , for the case = 2 , @xmath12 = 2.6 , @xmath1 = 0.6 , @xmath2 = 0.6 for a hierarchical distribution of clumps with an initial seed for the density distribution that provides a typical ( defined below ) placement with respect to the star .",
    "each point represents a particular viewing direction .",
    "one sees a large spread in the values of .",
    "the values for for this model range up to 6.8 , and to 2.4 .",
    "thus , this one model of clumpy dust can produce a wide range of stellar fluxes and scattered light .",

    "the average optical depth of the stellar flux that escapes from the nebula , is only 0.5 , the averaged optical depth through both the clumps and interclump material .",
    "it is sobering to recall that only a handful of reflection nebulae have been well observed , while each point in the figure represents a view of a single model with a particular clumping and @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig1 ] are the tracks of a spatially uniform dust distribution for the same @xmath2 (= 0.6 ) and various values of @xmath1 , as labeled .",
    "these lines were computed with the surprisingly accurate analytical approximation ( the scattered flux is underestimated by @xmath493% for  @xmath50 4 ) given by code ( 1973 ) .",
    "most reflection nebulae have been interpreted using these uniform models , in which case is the true optical depth of the nebula . for our hierarchical model , in about 15% of viewing directions we would conclude that the star is in front of most of the dust because the uniform models would give @xmath51 . in 40% of the directions",

    "the spread among the ( circles ) is relatively small because at large optical depth they become statistically uniform . since they are clumpy , the uniform - model albedos they suggest are significantly lower than the 0.6 used in the actual .",
    "the squares in figure [ fig5 ] have 33% of the dust mass in a constant density , so that the minimum optical depth is 4/3 .",

    "the large variations in properties of reflection nebulae with viewing angle come about because the radiation arises from the geometry of the statistical distribution of the ism relative to a point source rather than to itself .",
    "emissions form gas involve an integration over larger regions of more equal weight .",

    "we have considered only this geometry because we feel that it provides rather general results for strongly forward - throwing scattering ( say , @xmath56 ) . in this case , the dust on the near side of the nebula is likely to provide most of the scattered light .",
    "we consider our models as representing only this near - side dust .",
    "our hierarchical models , with their overall spherical distribution of clumps , are primarily aimed at interpreting reflected light from reflection nebulae illuminated by an exciting star .",
    "we will discuss reflection of the diffuse galactic radiation field from dusty globules at the end of this section .",
    "we now examine the limits on @xmath1 imposed by the amount of scattered light observed in reflection nebulae .",
    "since real nebulae show the illuminated cloud as it is viewed from only one direction , we must consider the spread of ( , ) from any particular dust distribution .",
    "we seek and , the minimum and maximum values of @xmath1 that can fit the observations .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we consider the 1300  observations of  with 50% of the stellar extinction assumed to be within the nebula ( witt et al . 1993 ; the circled dot in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "it lies in the middle of the envelope of the ( , ) points from various viewing angles .",
    "if we decreased the @xmath1 of the model , the scattered flux at each direction would become fainter and larger .",

    "varying parameters and geometries to obtain the absolute minimum @xmath1 ( 0.46 ; see below ) produced only changes in details .",
    "this result is robust because the observed is near the most efficient value for producing scattered light , as suggested by the uniform models ( see the minima of in the curves in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) the scattered light is near its maximum when @xmath32 , where the mean is about unity , so is best estimated for our hierarchical models near this value .",

    ". a hierarchical model in which the star happens to be within a clump has smaller errors . adding a constant density decreases the errors at  @xmath3 1 so that the average @xmath1 is @xmath65 0.5",
    "of course , there is no error in the unrealistic case of the density being uniform throughout .",
    "an important question is , how reliably can we determine @xmath5 from observations of a particular nebula covering a significant range in wavelengths , implying differing opacities or optical depths ? in this case , we might hope to find _ relative _ optical properties of the grains accurately even with uniform models .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the results for two wavelengths for which the extinctions ( both and ) differ by a factor of 2 : for example , ( 1000)/(1540 ) if the extinction law is the galactic average ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) and @xmath66=3.1 $ ] .",

    "the abscissa in the figure is for the lower extinction .",
    "all points in the figure were computed with the @xmath1 = 0.6 , so the `` true '' value of the albedo ratio is unity .",
    "we see that uniform models have difficulty in predicting even relative values of @xmath5 , since the spread in @xmath67 is @xmath340% .",
    "the figure gives the impression that if is @xmath68 , uniform models would derive a greater albedo at short wavelengths ( say , 1000 ) than at longer ( 1540  for a factor of 2 in the extinction ) .",

    "( 1993 ) suggest ( 1540 ) @xmath3(1.5  2 ) .",
    "however , models with the star embedded in a clump have the albedo ratios shift from mostly @xmath70 to mostly @xmath42 at ( 1540 ) @xmath71 , considerably greater than shown in the figure",
    ". these models would produce an illusory result @xmath1(1000 ) @xmath69(1740 ) .",
    "the basic problem is that the importance of a clump depends upon its optical depth .",
    "if a clump becomes optically thin , its existence no longer very significant to the radiative transport .",
    "similarly , increasing the optical depth of an optically thick clump has a limited effect on the radiation . while the density structure within the ism is independent of the wavelength , its geometry as regards radiation transfer is not .",
    "since the clumping produces the large spread in ( @xmath72 , it is not surprising that there is a wide spread in the importance of the clumps among various viewing angles .",
    "the problems of determining the variation of albedo at various wavelengths are small if the ratio of optical depths is close to unity .",
    "statements that the albedo is smaller at the 2175   feature than on either side of it ( e.g. , witt et al .",

    "can be the same at three wavelengths , and comparison of the relative albedos between those wavelengths is completely safe .",
    "we have seen that several properties of reflection nebulae change if the exciting star is embedded within a rather dense clump of dust .",
    "there is an increase in the scattered light ; the lowest values of for purely hierarchical models in figure [ fig4]@xmath1 ( i.e. , the large amounts of scattered light for the purely hierarchical models ) belong to such cases .",
    "the central clump ensures that the angle - averaged extinction , , is larger than for most models with the same  ( i.e. , the points in figure [ fig4]@xmath1 tend to have large if is small ) .",
    "figure [ fig4]@xmath55 shows that the addition of a constant density component makes the effects of a central clump rather unimportant because the radiation scattered by the uniform dust dominates . another effect of a star being embedded in a dense clump",
    "is that the errors of the albedo derived from observations of the same object at different wavelengths , illustrated in figure [ fig6 ] , are reduced because more of the scattering arises from the central clump .",
    "for such a clump , the opacity , but not the geometry , changes with wavelength . finally , there would tend to be more fir radiation from an embedded star because the grains are relatively close to the star , so they are absorbing a relatively large stellar flux , and the mean temperature of the grains would be relatively large for the same reason .",
    "galactic radiation scattered by isolated globules seen away from the galactic plane provides another diagnostic of grains ( mattila 1980 ) .",
    "witt , oliveri , & schild ( 1990 ) have analyzed such a globule and give references to other examples and discussion of the process .",
    "the density is concentrated towards the center of such globules .",
    "the reflected intensity rises outward from the center , peaks , and falls off to the sky brightness at the edge .",
    "showing that the scattering is forward - throwing .",
    "the reflected intensity can be related to the incident radiation predicted for both stars and the dgl out of the galactic plane .",
    "results were that at 4700   grains are forward - throwing ( @xmath740.8 ) and very efficient at scattering ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the globule was modeled with a very centrally condensed density distribution that is smooth and spherically symmetric , as seemed completely appropriate at the time .",
    "since turbulence driving clumps in the diffuse ism may decay when driving into a steepening density gradient , perhaps the ism within globules is relatively free from clumping . we can not assess the uncertainties in the grain properties derived from globules until we know more about the clumping within them .",
    "the major uncertainty would then be the prediction of the radiation incident upon them from the hierarchically clumped galaxy .",
    "there is no doubt about the applicability of hierarchical clumping to the dgl .",
    "observations such as those at 1740   ( schiminovich et al .",
    "2001 ) are based on large portions of the sky .",
    "we have seen that uniform spherical models of reflection nebulae underestimate @xmath1 if applied to optically thick situations ( large , but not necessarily large ) .",
    "our reflection nebula models are not ideally suited for interpreting the dgl in the uv , since distributions of the dust and exciting stars are skewed towards the galactic plane . however , our results have strong implications as regards the interpretation of the dgl as discussed in henry ( 2002 , hereafter h02 ) . in that paper",

    "the dotted lines in figure [ fig1 ] show the h02 models for three albedos identified by the nearby solid lines .",
    "we see that the h02 assumption predicts more scattered light than uniform models , and a lower albedo follows .    for @xmath86  ,",

    "the conclusion of h02 that @xmath1(1000 ) is very low ( `` perhaps 0.1 '' ) is perhaps understandable .",

    "our reflection nebula results commonly show that the same nebula can show very low and rather high scattered fluxes as seen from different angles .",
    "we strongly suspect that the same property applies to the dgl .",
    "our general result from hierarchical models is that photons , especially the unscattered ones coming directly from the star , can leak out of dust distributions far more easily than either uniform - density or h02 models would predict , so a dark sky does not necessarily imply a low albedo .",
    "we have arrived at a pessimistic , but we feel realistic , assessment of the ability of reflection nebulae illuminated by embedded stars to serve as diagnostics of interstellar grain properties .",
    "it is better to realize what we do not know , rather than believe that we know more than we do ! even if the scattered light from a reflection nebula and the extinction suffered by its exciting star are observed perfectly , the geometry of the dust is vital in the interpretation of the observations .",
    "hierarchical clumping , `` clumps within clumps within clumps '' , has a very large impact on the interpretation of both reflection nebulae and the dgl as compared to smooth density structures .",
    "hierarchical structures , demonstrated by co , 100 @xmath7 m , various other molecules , and h  i observations , make any determination of the optical properties of grains from reflection nebulae very difficult .",
    "our models had plausible power spectra for the autocorrelation function of the projected densities , with an exponent of the power of @xmath0 , unlike either uniform models or those that are clumped on a single scale ( exponent @xmath30 ) .",
    "the exact geometry of the dust is very difficult to determine because it depends on the placement of hierarchical clumps of dust around the star .",
    "we have made no interpretations of any reflection nebulae .",
    "it is now relatively easy to use monte carlo transfer codes to predict the scattering ( and polarization ) for objects _ with a known geometry .",
    "_ inverting observed intensities to determine the correct geometry , though , is _ very _ difficult , even with observations with good spatial resolution taken in multiple wavelengths .",
    "our hierarchical models have been schematic and do not begin to exhaust the possibilities of the real geometry of any reflection nebula .",
    "observations in the infrared and line emissions with good spatial resolution may eventually put useful limits on the actual geometry of the gas and dust , but the problem of inverting the data will always be difficult .",
    "an interesting possibility is that isolated bok globules may not be strongly clumped , so reflection of galactic light from them can diagnose grain properties .",
    "the penetration of turbulence into them might be weaker than its percolation through larger structures .",
    "nonclumpy globules can serve to diagnose grains because they scatter incident galactic radiation ( see witt et al .",
    "1990 for references and an explanation ) .",
    "each of our hierarchical models shows a very wide range of extinction optical depths ( ) and scattering ( ) when the nebula is viewed from various directions .",
    "the and observed for a reflection nebula represent a view of the dust from one direction .",
    "there is a very wide range of optical properties ( @xmath41 ) that can fit a given observation . with one or more hierarchical models we can fit the best observed uv reflection nebula , , with albedos @xmath91 0.5 over the range of @xmath2 that we tested ( 0.6  0.85 ) and with a variety of averaged optical depths through the model .    in general , reflection nebulae have substantial optical depths ( @xmath92 ) ; otherwise , the scattered fluxes are too faint . at substantial optical depths",
    ", uniform models can underestimate the albedo rather severely because they overestimate the scattered light .",
    "unless the star happens to be embedded within a dense clump , radiation can leak out of hierarchical clumps much more easily than from uniform dust",
    ".    the diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) has been interpreted ( henry 2002 ) with a recipe that predicts much more scattering from each star than our models , resulting in a low estimates of the uv albedo .",
    "murthy et al . ( 1991 ) failed to detect uv dgl , but our fractal models often have many directions from which the star and scattered light are very faint .",
    "thus , we do not believe that the faintness of the dgl in particular directions necessarily signifies a low albedo .",
    "the determination of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 depends upon the variation of reflected intensity across the face of a centrally illuminated reflection nebula , while we have only considered the flux of the scattered light .",
    "we feel that if the flux is as weakly constrained as our models show , the intensity will be similarly subject to variation because of the unknown placement of the star relative to the surrounding dust .",
    "even the relative variation of albedo with wavelength is difficult to determine from reflection nebulae if there are significant changes in opacity among the wavelengths .",
    "the problem is that the geometry is not really the same when the opacity changes .",
    "as opacity per h atom increases , optically thin clumps become thick and scatter light with a different geometrical arrangement , so the geometry of the nebula depends on wavelength .",
    "our overall assessment is that the optical properties of grains are probably as well constrained by theory as by observations .",
    "this statement is made in spite of well - known uncertainties in the theory of interstellar grains .",
    "these uncertainties are major : whether typical large grains are chemically homogeneous ( e.g. , silicate or carbonaceous ) or composite , whether grains contain voids , or if grains have very loose ( `` fractal '' ) structure .",
    "however , theory does not permit the large range of possible albedos provided by reflection nebulae . at first glance , various theories seem quite different .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) have pah molecules , small grains , and large grains of silicate or graphite .",
    "li & greenberg ( 1997 ) have pahs , small grains , and large grains with silicate cores and organic refractory mantles .",
    "mathis ( 1996 ) has composite grains with silicates , carbon , and vacuum intermixed within the same grain , plus small graphite that mimics pahs .",
    "draine & lee ( 1984 ) have silicate and graphite with a truncated power - law distribution of sizes .",
    "each size distribution is different .",
    "they all predict roughly the same @xmath5 because the response of the grains to radiation is set by fitting the well - observed interstellar extinction law ( @xmath93 ) , and cosmic abundances ( though somewhat controversial themselves ) constrain the materials .",
    "for instance , the values predicted for @xmath1(1430  ) are ( 0.40 , 0.30 , 0.37 , 0.40 ) for weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) , li & greenberg ( 1997 ) , mathis ( 1996 ) , and draine & lee ( 1984 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath87 are ( 0.65 , 0.63 , 0.53 , 0.57 ) .    fortunately , optical depths and column densities derived from comparisons of absorption and scattering along the same very narrow beam ( i.e. , towards a star ) are not affected by the microstructure within the ism .",
    "these measurements include most determinations of depletions of various ions in the ism , as well as the wavelength dependence of the interstellar extinction law .",
    "other implications for the hierarchical nature of dust clumping include a greatly increased penetration of radiation into molecular clouds and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
