    "thionucleobases , which are nucleobase analogues where one or more oxygen atoms have been substituted by sulphur , play an important role in molecular biology and pharmacology .",
    "they are , e.g. , contained in natural t - rna@xcite and , given their structural similarity to canonical nucleobases , they can be used as fluorescent probes in dna and rna,@xcite as well as for pharmaceutical purposes such as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy@xcite or antithyroid drugs@xcite . besides their occurrence in biological environments and wide applicability",
    ", thiobases have received a lot of attention due to their remarkably different photophysics in comparison to canonical nucleobases . despite their similar structure , the presence of a thiocarbonyl group results in a red - shift of the uv absorption spectrum and an increase of intersystem crossing.@xcite these differences have prompted a large number of studies with focus on their electronic structure@xcite and excited - state dynamics , both from the theoretical@xcite and experimental points of view , in particular by means of transient absorption spectroscopy.@xcite        among thiobases , the series of thiouracils , i.e. , 2-thiouracil ( 2tu ) , 4-thiouracil ( 4tu ) and 2,4-dithiouracil ( dtu ) , are particularly interesting . under experimental conditions ,",
    "all three compounds exist only in their oxothione or dithione tautomeric form@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : structures ] ) . the uv absorption spectra@xcite and photodeactivation mechanism@xcite of 2tu",
    "have been analysed extensively ; the absorption spectrum is slightly red - shifted compared to uracil and shows signs of a low - lying dark @xmath1 state.@xcite the uv absorption spectra of 4tu and dtu are considerably red - shifted compared to 2tu,@xcite but their general excited - state behaviour appears to be not much different from the one of 2tu : all three molecules show sub - picosecond intersystem crossing after excitation to the first absorption band.@xcite in contrast to the uv absorption spectra , not much has been reported on the photoelectron spectra of thiouracils .",
    "the main interest in this respect has been laid on the anions of these compounds,@xcite because ionizing radiation creates anions on the way to single and double strand breaks in dna .",
    "a single study on the tautomerism of 2tu and its methyl derivates@xcite contains a static he(i ) photoelectron spectrum of neutral 2tu .",
    "also , up to our knowledge , no time - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( trpes)@xcite has been reported for these molecules , even though this methodology has been extensively applied to study the excited - state dynamics of the canonical nucleobases@xcite ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a list of these experiments ) and a small number of nucleobase analogous.@xcite trpes has a number of advantages with respect to other spectroscopic techniques , e.g. , it allows to study the excited - state dynamics in the gas phase , while methods like transient absorption spectroscopy usually measure solvated compounds .",
    "furthermore , due to very different selection rules for photoionization compared to absorption , in trpes it is possible to probe dark states , which is very useful to elucidate the photophysical intermediates of these compounds .",
    "such knowledge can be particularly relevant for thiouracils , helping to promote the use and eventual functionalization of thiobases with phototherapeutic aims .    with this in mind , in this paper",
    "we report theoretical uv - photoelectron spectra 2tu , 4tu , and dtu from the ground state equilibrium geometries .",
    "we describe the character of the various ionization source orbitals and how thio - substitution influences the number , intensity , and position of the bands in the low - energy spectra . for 2tu",
    ", we also explore the photoelectron spectra from the neutral excited states at the frank - condon region as well as around the stationary points on the potential energy surface of the lowest excited singlet and triplet states , complementing our recent study@xcite on the relaxation and intersystem crossing mechanism after uv irradiation of this molecule . while we do not report time - resolved photoelectron spectra here ,",
    "the spectra at the stationary points indicate that single - photon uv - trpes alone probably can not discern the different deactivation pathways , in particular intersystem crossing , of photoexcited 2tu and should be complemented by some other method to probe the excited - state population .",
    "an efficient way to calculate static ground or excited - state uv - photoelectron spectra is to employ dyson norms as a measure of the ionization intensities . in the case of single - photon ionization ,",
    "the norms of dyson orbitals have been shown to be a good approximation for relative ionization probabilities.@xcite an excellent introduction into the description of photoionization using dyson orbitals can be found in references  , so here we only provide a brief overview .    in the following ,",
    "we describe transitions from a neutral source state @xmath2 to an ionic state @xmath3 as the ionization channel @xmath4 .",

    "the subscript @xmath9 of the braket indicates integration over @xmath11 electrons . as a measure for the relative ionization yield",

    "the cc - pvdz basis set@xcite was used in all calculations .",
    "neutral and ionic wavefunctions were computed on the multireference configuration interaction with single excitations ( mrcis ) level of theory using orbitals taken from preceding complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) calculations .",
    "the active space comprised 14 electrons ( 13 for doublets ) in 10 orbitals . to describe ionization from the singlet states , state - averaging ( sa ) with equal weights has been performed using 4 states for the neutral singlet and 10 states for the ionized doublet wavefunctions , denoted as sa(4s ) and sa(10d ) , respectively . to describe ionization from the triplet states , the neutral and ionized states employed a sa(4s+4 t ) and",

    "dyson norms have been calculated to estimate photoionization probabilities . to reduce the computational cost , the ci vectors were truncated by removing the configuration state functions with the smallest absolute coefficients until the remaining wavefunction has a norm of 0.97.@xcite a careful inspection showed that this procedure strongly reduces the computational costs of the dyson norms without significant deterioration of the results .",
    "finally , photoelectron spectra have been calculated from the @xmath30 minimum and , in case of 2tu also from the @xmath31 and @xmath32 minima , optimized at the mrcis level of theory specified above . in order to simulate vibrational broadening , for each compound 200",

    "the photoelectron spectrum of the ground state of 2tu was normalized to a maximum signal of one , and the same normalization factor was then used for all other spectra ( note that all spectra were calculated with the same number of geometries and the same full width at half maximum ) .",

    "the photoelectron spectrum of 2tu computed from the electronic ground state is compared to the experimental one of katritzky et al.@xcite in figure  [ fig:2tu_pes_experiment ] . as can be seen",
    ", there is a shift of @xmath36 towards lower binding energies ( as used here , the vertical energy difference between the neutral source state and the ionic state under consideration ) with respect to the experimental values .",
    "this shift originates from the lack of size extensivity@xcite of mrcis and the difference in the number of correlated electrons in neutral and ionized wavefunctions .",
    "however , the peak separations and relative peak heights in the simulated spectrum agree nicely with the experimental data , particularly at low energies , showing that the method predicts the energetic spacing of the ionic states and the relative intensities correctly . for higher binding energies the experimental spectrum shows a very broad band starting at @xmath37 , which could not be reproduced by our calculations .",
    "we assume that this band originates either from ionization to higher - lying excited doublet states or from ionization from @xmath38 orbitals , both effects not well described by our simulation .",
    "an extension of the simulated energy range to higher doublet states with the present level of theory is not expected to yield better results because already in the present calculations the highest states ( @xmath39 ) are strongly mixed and have large contributions of double excitations within the reference space . since the description of higher - lying states would require a much more accurate electronic structure method , which is out of the scope of this paper , the analysis following in the next sections focuses on the lower part of the spectrum .",

    "an electron is excited from an orbital located at the sulphur atom and promoted to a @xmath29 orbital on the pyrimidine ring .",
    "quantitatively , one can see that the excitation energies are described too high at the mrcis level of theory , more so for the @xmath55 state . as this would lead to systematically too low binding energies in the simulation of photoelectron spectra with excited states as ionization source , an additional shift of @xmath58 ( towards higher binding energies ) for the @xmath31 spectrum and @xmath59 for the @xmath54 one",
    "was introduced .",
    "ionization of an electron which has been excited into an antibonding orbital ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) requires lower energy than to eject electrons in bonding orbitals .",
    "consequently , the dyson orbitals ( figure  [ fig : s1s2_dysorbs_2tu ] ) for the first ionizations ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) are very similar to the @xmath29 orbitals occupied in the @xmath31 and @xmath54 states . the second band arises mostly from ionization of the @xmath0 orbital located at the @xmath62 bond .",
    "the first band of each spectrum ( figure  [ fig : s1s2_spectra_2tu ] ) is in the region of @xmath63 and thus more than @xmath64 separated from the onset of the @xmath30 spectrum and from the next band in the excited - state spectra . judging from the simulated spectra it should be possible to obtain a clear signal from the lowest ionization channels of the excited singlet states without interference of the ground state signal using probe laser energies of @xmath65 .",

    "the minimum geometries are presented .",
    "the spectra have been shifted by @xmath36 . ]",
    "an important application of photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with pump - probe experiments is the ability to track different states and relaxation pathways in the excited - state dynamics .",
    "a recent exploration of the possible reaction pathways using static quantum - chemical calculations@xcite suggests that 2tu will , after electronic excitation to the @xmath54 , quickly cross to the @xmath31 where it is trapped in a minimum with low chance to reach the crossing seam to the ground state .",
    "instead , it is very likely that the system undergoes intersystem crossing into the energetically close @xmath66 state and from there internally converts into one of two @xmath32 minima ( named `` boat '' and `` pyramidalized '' in ref .  ) .",
    "an interesting question is to investigate whether it will be possible to gain insight into this intersystem crossing process of 2tu by trpes .",
    "we therefore optimized the @xmath31 and both @xmath32 minima ( geometries shown in figure  [ fig : s1mint1min_compare_2tu ] ) and generated photoelectron spectra from these minima .",
    "table  [ tab:2tu_singlet_states ] collects the relative energies of these minima with respect to the equilibrium geometry at the mrcis and ms - caspt2 levels of theory . despite the energetic order of the two @xmath32 minima being different with both methods , they are still very close in energy and no additional shift was applied . figure  [ fig : s1mint1min_compare_2tu ] displays the three excited - state photoelectron spectra of 2tu . for each minimum",
    ", we obtain a weak band in the 58  ev energy range and an intense band above 8.5  ev , where the latter band is much more intense for the triplet state due to ionization to quartet states .",
    "the low - energy bands are quite similar and strongly overlapping and the high - energy band will likely be covered by ionization from the ground state .",
    "hence , based on these spectra , we suggest that the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states can not be discriminated by single - photon ionization using a probe laser in the suggested energy range of @xmath65 . depending on the actual probe laser energy used ,",
    "only part of the bands will contribute to the signal and hence a low intensity can be expected .",
    "most importantly , the bands of the three spectra overlap strongly , and as can be seen , the small error in the energies of the neutral states due to mrcis is not relevant .",
    "based on these results , we predict that single - photon trpes alone will not allow to track the population transfer from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in 2tu .",
    "the uv - photoelectron spectra of three thio - analogues of uracil , 2-thiouracil ( 2tu ) , 4-thiouracil ( 4tu ) and 2,4-dithiouracil ( dtu ) have been simulated using dyson norms as a measure for the relative ionization probabilities of the different ionization channels . in all three molecules , the respective first band of the photoelectron spectra is mainly due to ionization from the @xmath7 and @xmath0 orbitals on sulphur . for 2tu and 4tu",
    ", the second band corresponds to ionization from the @xmath7 and @xmath0 orbitals on oxygen , while for all three compounds the highest calculated band is related to the pyrimidine @xmath0 system .",
    "these two ( dtu ) or three ( 2tu , 4tu ) bands are well separated .    in the monosubstitued thiouracils ( 2tu and 4tu ) the position of the substitution has some effect on the band shape . with reasonably good resolution in the energy domain",
    ", we predict that the two molecules could be discerned mainly by the shape of the bands that originate from ionization from the oxygen orbitals at around 10  ev binding energy .",
    "the photoelectron spectrum of dtu is easily distinguishable from the other compounds since it lacks the band from the oxygen - orbital ionization completely and in return it shows an intense double peak from the ionization out of orbitals located on the sulphur atoms .",
    "an inspection of the excited - state photoelectron spectra from the @xmath31 and @xmath54 states of 2tu shows that the excited states can be detected without being disturbed by the ground state signal .",
    "furthermore , the photoelectron spectra of 2tu simulated at the relevant @xmath31 and @xmath32 minima show strong overlap and very similar intensity .",
    "hence , experimental pump - probe uv - trpes using single - photon ionization alone might not be able to track the populations of the different excited singlet and triplet states and therefore intersystem crossing could be opaque to this methodology",
