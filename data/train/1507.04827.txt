    "@xcite in particular , through an analysis of electronic correlations among relevant cu and o orbitals , the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model has been derived as a minimal model of high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "@xcite however , its properties and their relationship to the anomalous features are not well understood , primarily because of difficulties in dealing with the no - double - occupancy constraint .",
    "although this model can also be derived effectively from the 2d hubbard model in the large - repulsion limit , @xcite it is not clear how similar the two models properties are in the parameter regime relevant to high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "in fact , the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models have frequently been studied from different viewpoints : the former has been considered a doped mott insulator accessible from slave - particle theories , @xcite while the latter has been considered a strongly interacting electron system accessible from fermi liquid theory .",
    "@xcite in some studies , double occupancy , which is excluded in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , has been considered important to the anomalous features .",

    "<S> the single - particle spectral properties of the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate high - temperature superconductors are investigated using cluster perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> various anomalous features observed in cuprate high - temperature superconductors are collectively explained in terms of the dominant modes near the mott transition in this model . </S>",
    "<S> although the behavior of the dominant modes in the low - energy regime is similar to that in the two - dimensional hubbard model , significant differences appear near the mott transition for the high - energy electron removal excitations which can be considered to primarily originate from holon modes in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the overall spectral features are confirmed to remain almost unchanged as the cluster size is increased from @xmath2 to @xmath3 sites by using a combined method of the non - abelian dynamical density - matrix renormalization group method and cluster perturbation theory . </S>"
