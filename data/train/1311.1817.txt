    "leaving aside molecular magnets , magnetic chains and layered magnets , there are many thousands of magnetic materials known to us .",
    "these typically exhibit a low temperature phase with some long - range ordered magnetic structure which , no matter how complicated , can be inferred in principle from the bragg scattering of neutrons .",
    "their elementary excitations , which are called magnons , are the normal modes of the coupled magnetic moments .",
    "they are bosonic quasiparticles and , possess gapless modes @xmath2 so - called goldstone modes @xmath2 if the moments possess a continuous global symmetry .",
    "suppose one found , in a neutron scattering experiment on a clean cubic magnet , an absence of bragg peaks well below the curie - weiss temperature co - existing with linearly dispersing excitations while heat capacity measurements gave no indications of a phase transition .",
    "a remarkable possibility is that such a magnet might have no symmetry - broken order _",
    "at all _ and that the magnetic excitations above the ground state behave like charged particles interacting with linearly dispersing radiation .",
    "it is the purpose of this review is to explain how this possibility might be realized in pyrochlore magnets .",
    "such an unusual state of matter is one of many possible types of quantum spin liquid @xmath2 so named because quantum fluctuations are responsible for keeping the spins from entering a long - range ordered phase characterized by some broken symmetry even at zero temperature .",
    "quantum spin liquids are to be contrasted with ordinary molecular liquids , which have only short - range order , and superfluid phases , which are symmetry broken phases .",
    "they are also to be contrasted with conventional paramagnets and also with collective paramagnets , or so - called classical spin liquids , which are finite temperature states exhibiting nontrivial short - range correlations .",
    "quantum spin liquids are quite different : in common with fractional quantum hall liquids , they appear disordered to local probes but they have some form of order which is instead  encoded \" nonlocally and which is often not characterizable in terms of symmetry .",
    "not only are the natural characterising observables in quantum spin liquids nonlocal but they are often independent of anything but the topology of the nonlocal observable - such spin liquids are said to be  topologically ordered \" . for pragmatists ,",
    "an essential feature of quantum spin liquids is that they are quantum phases exhibiting peculiar  fractionalized \" excitations meaning that the microscopic degrees of freedom are , for practical purposes , split into parts by the strong correlation or , more precisely , as a consequence of having long - range quantum entanglement in the ground state .    until the mid-80 s , condensed matter physicists had been able to understand a huge variety of different phases of matter @xmath2 indeed essentially all known states of matter @xmath2 in terms of symmetry and symmetry breaking .",
    "the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect in 1986 alerted condensed matter physicists to the importance of radically new concepts underlying the organisation of matter at low energies .",
    "quantum spin liquids have been the main medium through which theorists have been able to generalise the physics of the fractional quantum hall effect and the physics of low dimensional magnets and there has been immense progress in the understanding of these states of matter over the last thirty years .",
    "yet no theoretical tool exists that will allow people to determine all possible ways in which matter can organise itself and for really ground - breaking insights we rely on guidance from experiment .",
    "it is for this reason that the experimental realisation of quantum spin liquids has been eagerly anticipated in the community @xcite .",
    "one strategy to uncover these states of matter has been to explore magnets with magnetic ions sitting on lattices of corner - sharing triangles and tetrahedra .",
    "antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between the ions are highly frustrated on these lattices such that any transition temperature occurs at a scale much lower than the curie - weiss temperature scale . in this way , one might hope that conventional long - range order is evaded entirely . a deeper reason for exploring geometrically frustrated magnets",
    "is that the semiclassical ground states are typically subject to a local constraint that can be interpreted as an emergent gauge invariance .",
    "quantum fluctuations may then lead to a quantum spin liquid that is equivalent to a deconfined phase of a quantum mechanical gauge theory which , as we explain below , corresponds to a fractionalized phase .",
    "at least the semiclassical part of this strategy is beautifully realized by a pair of materials which are becoming perhaps the archetypes of geometrical frustration among real magnetic materials : the spin ices dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a great deal of recent theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to exploring their rich behaviour at low temperatures where they enter a collective paramagnetic phase characterized by distinctive magnetic correlations that follow from a local constraint on the magnetic moments on each tetrahedron .",
    "the existence of spin ices is a promising state of affairs for the general research programme of evincing a quantum spin liquid in a magnetic material @xcite .",
    "whereas many proposed models with quantum spin liquid ground states are somewhat unphysical , as we explain below , quantum fluctuations acting on the set of spin ice states can be reasonably expected to lead to a quantum spin liquid with gapless photon - like excitations .",
    "we call this _ quantum spin ice_. furthermore , among the relatives of spin ice materials , there are a number of materials where spin ice correlations exist at finite temperature and in which quantum fluctuations appear significant . the low temperature phases of these materials remain to be understood .",
    "this review is intended to bring together in one place an introduction to the quantum spin ice phase along with a survey of those materials among the pyrochlore magnets most likely to harbour such a quantum spin liquid state .",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : spin_ice ] , by reviewing some aspects of the physics of the classical spin ice because ( i ) the magnetism in these materials is the precursor state to quantum spin ice and ( ii ) a familiarity with the microscopic aspects of the pyrochlore magnets gained thereby will be invaluable in assessing the prospects for uncovering a quantum spin liquid among them . in section  [ sec : qsi ] , we review the arguments leading from an xxz -like model on the pyrochlore lattice to an effective low energy description of the physics as an emergent electromagnetism .",
    "this proceeds in two mains steps @xmath2 by mapping from the spin model to a quantum dimer model ( section  [ sec : spin2loops ] ) and by mapping from the dimer model to a lattice gauge theory ( section  [ sec : loops2gauge ] ) .",
    "we then describe the properties of the quantum spin ice phase ( section  [ sec : phenom ] ) and discuss both the stability ( section  [ sec : stability ] ) and naturalness ( section  [ sec : natural ] ) of this state of matter .",
    "we conclude by describing other contexts in which a u(1 ) liquid might be found in condensed matter systems ( section  [ sec : context ] ) .",
    "the next main part of the review discusses quantum spin ice from a materials perspective .",
    "a discussion of the relevant microscopic features of candidate materials in section  [ sec : materials_considerations ] is followed by a description of the specific features of various candidate quantum spin ices including tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( [ sec : tb2ti2o7 ] ) , pr@xmath0m@xmath0o@xmath1 ( m@xmath3sn , zr ) ( [ sec : pr2m2o7 ] ) and yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( [ sec : yb2ti2o7 ] ) .",
    "our discussion of the physics of spin ice begins with the problem of classical ising spins @xmath4 that reside on the sites of a pyrochlore lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra ( see .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore ] ) and interact among themselves via an antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbour exchange coupling @xmath5 .",
    "this model , first considered by anderson in a 1956 paper @xcite , was aimed at describing the magnetic ordering of spins on the octahedral sites of normal spinels and the related problem of ionic ordering in inverse spinels , both systems having a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the ising antiferromagnet hamiltonian , @xmath6 , of anderson s model is @xmath7 with @xmath8 and where the sum is carried over the nearest - neighbour bonds of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "anderson found that @xmath6 admits an exponentially large number of ground states given by the simple rule that each `` up '' and  down tetrahedron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore ] ) must have a vanishing net spin .",
    "that is , on each tetrahedron , two spins must be  up \" and have @xmath9 and two spins must be  down \" and have @xmath10 .",
    "anderson further recognized that this problem is closely related to that of hydrogen bonding in the common hexagonal ( i@xmath11 ) phase of water ice or , more precisely , its cubic ( i@xmath12 ) phase , , has a hexagonal structure , while the pyrochlore has cubic symmetry .",
    "the ising pyrochlore problem is equivalent to cubic ice , i@xmath12 , and not i@xmath11 .",
    "this difference does not modify the second ice - rule analogy or the connection between the statistical mechanics problem of proton coordination in water ice and that of the spin arrangement in anderson s model or spin ice below ] both being characterized by hydrogen ( proton ) configurations that obey the two bernal - fowler ice rules @xcite .",
    "the ` second ice rule ' is the one relevant to anderson s model and to the main topic of this review.@xmath2o@xmath13 bond .",
    "this rule has no equivalent in anderson s model and in spin ice discussed below @xcite ] the second rule states that for each fourfold coordinated oxygen o@xmath13 ion , there must two protons ( h@xmath14 ) near it and covalently bonded to that reference o@xmath13 ion , hence providing a hydrogen bond to two neighbouring o@xmath13 ions ( hence h@xmath15o molecules ) . at the same time , there are two protons far , which are themselves covalently bonded to the two other oxygen ions and hence hydrogen - bonded ` back ' to the original reference o@xmath13 ion . in other words , for each o@xmath13 ion , there are two protons near and covalently bonded to it and two farther protons hydrogen - bonded to it @xcite .",
    "this rule leads to an underconstrained system in regards to the number of minimum energy proton configurations in i@xmath11 and i@xmath12 and , in fact , leads to an exponentially large number of nearly degenerate proton configurations .",
    "linus pauling had estimated in 1935 @xcite the number of ice - rule fulfilling ground states in water ice and the resulting low - temperature residual entropy @xmath16 , finding close agreement with the experimental value being determined at about the same time by giauque and co - workers @xcite .",
    "pauling s reasoning for estimating @xmath16 can be adapted to anderson s model in a number of closely related ways @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of magnetic sites on the pyrochlore lattice and @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "pauling s estimate is accurate within a few percent from the more precise estimate , both for i@xmath11 @xcite and the anderson model ( or , equivalently , i@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "anderson s antiferromagnetic ( af ) model with ising spins pointing along the @xmath20 direction ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore ] ) is unrealistic since there is no reason for the spins to prefer the @xmath21 axis over the @xmath22 or @xmath23 axes in a system such as the pyrochlore lattice which has cubic symmetry .",
    "consequently , that model did not much attract the attention of theorists and experimentalists investigating real magnetic materials for a long time .",
    "this changed with the 1997 discovery by harris , bramwell and co - workers of frustrated ferromagnetism in the insulating ho@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 pyrochlore oxide @xcite .",

    "ho@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 was found to not develop conventional long - range magnetic order down to at least 50 mk @xcite . to rationalize this surprising behaviour , harris and co -",
    "workers put forward the following argument .",
    "because of the strong local crystal electric field of trigonal symmetry acting at the magnetic sites , each ho@xmath25 magnetic moment is forced to point strictly `` in '' or `` out '' of the two tetrahedra joined by that site , a direction that is along the pertinent cubic @xmath28 $ ] threefold symmetry axis that passes through the middle of the two site - joined tetrahedra ( see fig .  [ ising_pyrochlore ] ) .",
    "this large magnetic anisotropy allows one to describe the orientation of a ho@xmath25 magnetic moment by an effective classical ising spin @xmath29 , with the @xmath30 quantization direction now the local @xmath28 $ ] direction at site @xmath31 . for a single tetrahedron with such a @xmath28 $ ] ising spin at each of the four corners of a tetrahedron , and interacting with a nearest - neighbour fm coupling ,",
    "the minimum energy is one of six states with two spins pointing `` in '' and two spins pointing `` out '' .",
    "the `` up''/``down '' directions of anderson s af model in eqn .",
    "( [ h_af ] ) now become the `` in''/``out '' directions of the frustrated fm ising system @xcite .",
    "this point can be made clearer by considering the following simple model of interacting microscopic angular momenta @xmath32 written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is ferromagnetic . with",
    "@xmath32 constrained to point along the local @xmath30 [ 111 ] ising direction , we have @xmath35 with @xmath36 the magnitude of the angular momentum @xmath32 of the rare - earth ion . since @xmath37 on the pyrochlore lattice",

    "[ ising_pyrochlore ] ) . on the other hand , as in the af model ,",
    "the number of ground states in this frustrated ising ferromagnet model is exponentially large in the system size , resulting in an extensive residual entropy , again given approximately by the pauling entropy @xmath16 . in accord with this prediction , a number of magnetic specific heat measurements , and thus magnetic entropy ,",

    "the six transverse oxygen ions are equidistant from the central rare earth site ( @xmath41  ) , lying further from the rare earth site than the axial oxygen ions which are at @xmath42  .",
    "[ ising_pyrochlore],width=264 ]    perhaps at least as interesting as the experimental determination of an @xmath16 residual entropy in these systems is the observation , originally made by harris _",

    "this observation led harris , bramwell and co - workers to coin the name _ spin ice _ for these systems .    while the frustrated nearest - neighbour fm ising model helped rationalize the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of spin ice compounds @xcite , it was nevertheless initially found rather puzzling why these materials should be described by such a simple model or even possess a residual low - temperature magnetic entropy equal to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "while the resolution of this paradox for classical spin ice may at first hand appear peripheral to the topic of this review , it will prove of significant importance and rich in physical insight when we later discuss the low - energy excitations in quantum spin ice .    in the ho and dy based spin ice compounds",

    "we thus have @xmath49 in these systems and dipolar interactions must therefore be considered carefully at the outset when discussing spin ice physics in real materials @xcite . crucially ,",
    "magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions display two key features that would seem to make them antagonistic to the formation of a degenerate low - temperature state with extensive entropy .",

    "would naively appear to dramatically constrain admissible minimum energy orientations of the moments well beyond the ice rule imposed by the nearest - neighbour model of eqn .",
    "( [ h_af ] ) .",
    "interestingly , one finds that dipolar interactions between local @xmath39 ising moments truncated at the nearest - neighbour distance are ferromagnetic - like , as in the harris _",
    "_ frustrated ising model @xcite . this dipolar spin ice model ( dsim ) @xcite , and its subsequent generalization , including additional short - range ising exchange interactions @xcite ,",
    "has proven highly successful at explaining quantitatively a wide variety of behaviours displayed by spin ice compounds .",
    "perhaps most noteworthy about the dsim is the observation , first made through monte carlo simulations @xcite , that the long - range part of the dipolar interactions beyond the nearest neighbour distance appears `` self - screened '' @xcite .",
    "that is , they only lead to a transition to long - range order at a temperature @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this critical temperature is much lower than the temperature @xmath58 at which the system crosses over from the trivial paramagnetic state to the spin ice regime , characterized by a fulfilment of the ice rules , and marked by a broad peak in the magnetic specific heat @xcite .  .",
    "for positive ferromagnetic @xmath59 the crossover temperature @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "] this behaviour originates from a remarkable feature of the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interactions on the pyrochlore lattice @xcite .",
    "namely , on this lattice , magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions differ very little , and only at short distance , from a model hamiltonian with nearest neighbour interactions with the same ground state degeneracy as that prescribed by the ice rules @xcite .",
    "of the two formulations explaining that phenomenology @xcite , the one that we discuss next is the most relevant to the topic of this review .",
    "perhaps the formulation that has been most simply able to capture in one sweep the key features of the dsim is the so - called dumbbell model of castelnovo , moessner and sondhi @xcite .",
    "in essence , the dumbbell model is a way of visualizing a multipole expansion about diamond lattice sites .",
    "it takes for a start the point - like magnetic dipoles of the dsim and fattens them up into a rod with two magnetic charges @xmath61 centered on the two tetrahedra connected by a @xmath28 $ ] ising spin . the centers of the tetrahedra form a diamond lattice with lattice spacing @xmath62 .",
    "the magnetic charge @xmath63 is chosen so that , given the diamond center - to - center distance @xmath62 , one recovers the original magnetic dipole moment with @xmath64 .",
    "the original model of point - like dipoles has now been recast as a model of magnetic charges interacting though a `` magnetic coulomb potential '' , the latter model having , by the construction @xmath64 , the same @xmath65 dipolar far - field as the dsim . since in this model the magnetic charges , or `` monopoles '' , from the four dumbbells at the center of a given tetrahedron overlap , a regularization of the coulomb potential is introduced @xcite .",
    "the strength of the regularization potential for overlapping monopoles is adjusted so as to correctly recover the interaction energy for nearest - neighbour dipoles along with the contribution coming from a nearest - neighbour exchange @xcite .    as a result of these constructions ,",
    "the dumbbell hamiltonian @xmath66 can thus be expressed in terms of the net charge @xmath67 and @xmath68 at the center of the @xmath69th tetrahedron , with @xmath70 where the onsite term @xmath71 is determined from the condition that this model should reproduce the spin flip energy of the dipolar spin ice model . from this formulation , it is clear that in the limit @xmath72 , the ground states of the system have @xmath73 for all @xmath69 .",
    "these are precisely the two - in / two - out ice - rule obeying states . for finite @xmath71 , the low - temperature state of the system",
    "is ultimately determined by the competition between the self - energy cost of a charge and the energy gain of a specific arrangement of positive and negative magnetic charges on the diamond lattice .",
    "this dumbbell model describes rather accurately the dsim , in particular the long - range @xmath65 nature of its dipolar part .",
    "most importantly , the dumbbell model has the same quasi - degenerate ice - rule obeying states as the nearest - neighbour frustrated ising model of harris _ et al . _ and displays , in particular , a residual low - temperature pauling entropy @xmath16 .    noting that the condition of vanishing charge @xmath73 is equivalent to the `` 2-in''/``2-out '' spin configuration on each tetrahedron , we may introduce a coarse - grained  spin field \" which we denote as @xmath74 for a reason that will become clear in the next section .",
    "then the statement that @xmath73 is akin to stating that the  spin field \" has zero divergence , @xmath75 .",
    "when there is no local source or sink of the coarse - grained `` spin field '' in classical spin ice , the magnetic structure factor , which can be measured experimentally via neutron scattering , exhibit singularities in reciprocal space at nuclear bragg points @xcite .",
    "the intensity profile around these singularities has a characteristic  bow - tie \" form in planes through the singular points which have come to be known as `` pinch - points '' @xcite .",
    "for a reason that will be expanded upon in section 3 , one refers to the @xmath76 charges , sources and sinks of the spin field @xmath77 , as gauge charges .",
    "the beauty of the dipolar spin ice is that , thanks to the underlying dipolar interactions , the gauge charge is also a magnetic charge , or `` monopole '' that is a sink or source of the local magnetization field , @xcite , since each spin comes along with its magnetic moment @xmath78 .",
    "so one perspective on the effective low - energy theory of dipolar spin ice is that of a magnetic coulomb gas , with charges on a diamond lattice and in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the flipping of an individual ising spin thus corresponds to the nucleation of two magnetic charges of opposite sign which can then thermally diffuse while interacting with an effective emergent coulomb potential . in short , at low - temperature and at low - energy ,",
    "the long - distance physics of dipolar spin ice is equivalent to a magnetic formulation of gauss s law in which the elementary excitations interact with @xmath79  magnetic \" coulomb potential as given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : coulomb ] ) .",
    "as we shall see in section 3 , the present magnetic charges correspond to the classical limit of the magnetic charge of the @xmath80 description of the quantum spin liquid . in the present case of the classical dipolar spin",
    "ice , these are a remarkable manifestation of the `` fractionalization '' of the individual elementary dipole moment ( spin ) flip excitation and , because of the @xmath79 nature of their mutual coulomb interaction , the work to separate two charges of opposite sign is finite and the charges are said to be `` deconfined '' @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite , highlighting the existence of monopole excitations of energetic origin in the dipolar spin ice materials , has led to a number of experiments aimed at probing their effects on various magnetic properties .",
    "because this chapter in the history of spin ices fits neatly into a discussion of the experimental probes of exotic excitations , we briefly describe a cross - section of this work .",
    "we direct the reader to recent reviews for a more extensive discussion @xcite . for the purpose of this review ,",
    "it suffices to say that , while the description of the low - energy excitations in dipolar spin ice model in terms of monopoles is most likely correct , few experiments can be said to have positively exposed monopoles in classical spin ice compounds .",
    "some first generation experiments using muon spin relaxation @xcite and relaxation of the bulk magnetization @xcite have later been subject to a controversy in the former case @xcite and the interpretation critiqued in the latter @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation time extracted from magnetic ac susceptibility has been partially rationalized in terms of diffusive motion of monopoles @xcite , but such a description becomes less compelling deep in the spin ice regime @xcite , either because of complexities arising from sample quality and/or disorder issues @xcite or yet other aspects of the real materials that have not been incorporated into the magnetic coulomb gas theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "from another perspective , we note that the assignment of the temperature dependence of the width of the neutron scattering lineshape near the so - called `` pinch points '' in the ho@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 material @xcite to the thermal nucleation of monopoles with separations of @xmath81 @xmath47 is not evident .",
    "the reason for that is that the lowest temperature considered in ref .",
    "[ ] was barely below @xmath82 k at which this material enters the spin ice state @xcite .",
    ", deep in the paramagnetic regime , is presumably due to the pinch - point singularity arising directly from the anisotropic @xmath65 dipolar interaction @xcite . ]",
    "the monopole - based description of the neutron scattering data of dy@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 in a magnetic field along the @xmath83 $ ] direction is , at this time , perhaps the one that most compellingly endorses the picture of fractionalized monopoles in these materials @xcite . while not direct evidence for their existence , the field - driven first order metamagnetic transition for a field along the @xmath28 $ ] direction is nicely and simply rationalised in terms of a crystallisation of positive and negative monopoles @xcite .    in view of the prospect of ultimately identifying quantum spin ice candidate materials characterized by another gapped and fractionalized excitation , in addition to the magnetic monopole , as well as an emerging gauge boson ( `` photon '' ) , new experimental methodologies with unambiguous signatures for these various excitations need to be developed .",
    "such techniques could be first benchmarked on classical dipolar spin ices and perhaps proved successful in achieving an explicit demonstration of the existence of the aforementioned `` monopoles '' .",
    "having reviewed the topic of classical spin ices , with a focus on the description of their low temperature behaviour in terms of fractionalized monopoles , we now move onto the heart of this review  the topic of quantum spin ice .",
    "the reader who wishes to study the original literature on classical and quantum spin ice will come across a number of different naming conventions for the emergent particles and fields .",
    "we give here a quick guide to the main conventions and , at the same time , fix our own .",
    "as stated above , in classical spin ice , the ice constraint on each tetrahedron can be thought of as a divergence free condition on a coarse - grained field . in the literature one can find the various naming conventions given in the top panel of table  [ tab : names ] .",
    "point - like defects resulting from the local breaking of the ice constraint are sources of the coarse - grained field .",
    "since the emergent charges have a physical magnetic response , we call them magnetic charges or monopoles in common with the classical spin ice literature @xcite",
    ".    a second kind of gapped excitation appears in quantum spin ice which we call a vison .",
    "the nature of this excitation can be seen most clearly from the compact gauge theory discussed in section  [ sec : loops2gauge ] . in this effective field theory @xcite",
    ", the spin ice constraint appears as gauss law in an electric field defined on links of the diamond lattice .",
    "the effective field theory has both electric and magnetic degrees of freedom . in the convention of hamiltonian lattice gauge theory ,",
    "the vison excitation is a source of magnetic flux and is typically called a magnetic monopole in that community . at this point , confusion might easily arise .",
    "we have tried to keep our notation consistent with that , so far , predominantly employed by classical spin ice researchers and , for this reason , have swapped the convention @xmath2 the vison appears as a source of electric field while the magnetic monopole keeps its identity as the emergent charge familiar from classical spin ice @xcite .",
    "we keep ourselves , however , from calling the vison an electric charge because , while the magnetic monopole is indeed a source of the physical magnetic field ( or , more correctly the macroscopic field @xmath84 ) , the vison is a merely a source of the fictitious electric field in the lattice gauge theory .",

    "however , magnetic monopoles appear when the standard model is embedded in a theory with a larger symmetry including the famous @xmath180 grand unified theory of the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "one of the features of compact @xmath80 gauge theory is that charges ( the visons and monopoles ) are naturally quantised .",
    "this feature assumes some importance in fundamental physics where the quantisation of charges is something that one would like to explain . within the aforementioned gut , the appearance of monopoles goes hand - in - hand with the quantisation of the fundamental charges ( among other important features ) .",
    "such guts have inspired experimental searches for magnetic charges @xcite . ]    having noted the types of excitations and the hierarchy of energy scales in quantum spin ice , we turn to plausible experimental signatures of a magnet with a low energy @xmath80 phase . at the highest temperatures ,",
    "the magnet is a featureless paramagnet . upon cooling ,",
    "the material enters a classical spin ice regime with a temperature dependent density of monopoles and a pauling residual entropy .",
    "this state of matter is well - known to exhibit distinctive dipolar spin - spin correlations which show up as pinch points in the neutron scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "the quantum dimer model at infinite temperature is nothing other than classical spin ice and , therefore , this model does not capture the crossover into the true high temperature paramagnetic regime of the underlying spin model @xcite .    at the lowest temperatures , within the @xmath80 phase , there should be quite distinctive experimental signatures . while there should be no magnetic bragg peaks , inelastic neutron scattering can in principle probe the linearly dispersing photon modes as recently worked out in ref .",
    "[ ] since , like magnons , these excitations carry spin one . our calculation of the expected inelastic scattering pattern ( based on that in ref .",
    "[ ) ] between high symmetry points in the brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "[ ins ] where the most energetic modes appear on the scale of the ring exchange coupling .",
    "the energy integrated scattering at zero temperature is presented in fig .",
    "thermal fluctuations cause the photons to decohere and the neutron cross section crosses over smoothly into the pinch point scattering of classical spin ice @xcite .    at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "the phenomenology is , to date , not completely clear .",
    "the @xmath181 ( thermal radiation ) law in the heat capacity should break down as visons and magnetic charges become thermally nucleated and the residual entropy recovers from zero , at zero temperature , to the pauling entropy , in the classical ice regime .",
    "these effective charges will also lead to diffuse neutron scattering as is well - known in classical spin ice @xcite .",
    "also , the analogy with the compact @xmath80 gauge theory suggests that thermal fluctuations should give the photon a small mass and the otherwise coulomb - like electric and magnetic charges should become screened .. dimensional gauge theory is wrapped onto a circle of radius @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the inverse temperature . at high temperatures",
    "the radius of the circle is small so that the @xmath173 dimensional gauge theory may be viewed as a @xmath184 dimensional gauge theory at zero temperature . in three dimensions",
    ", the wilson loop expectation value exhibits an area law @xcite .",
    "then , the same argument that implies that the @xmath184 dimensional gauge theory has a gapped photon can be used to see that the four dimensional gauge theory does as well at high temperatures @xcite ] whereas the thermal occupation of photon modes is sufficient to observe the crossover between quantum and classical ice , and although the quantum liquid at zero temperature is adiabatically connected to the trivial paramagnet , a more featured scenario is possible .",
    "in particular , a form of gauge mean field theory for quantum spin ice produces , at finite temperature , a truly novel behavior : a first order transition between the high temperature paramagnet and the quantum spin ice state @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable features of the @xmath80 spin liquid is that it is stable to all local perturbations @xcite .",
    "this is surprising for at least two reasons .",
    "one is simply that the phase is gapless and there is therefore an _ a priori _ danger that some perturbations may open a gap .",
    "a second reason is that the gauge invariance of the lattice model is not exact but is an emergent property at low energies .",
    "one can see by power - counting that all gauge noninvariant perturbations to the maxwell action are relevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite so one might expect that the @xmath80 liquid would not survive such perturbations .",
    "crucially , for the search of this exotic state of matter among real materials , it turns out that this fear is likely not justified as we now discuss .",
    "because the @xmath80 gauge theory comes from a microscopic spin model on a lattice , the gauge group is compact so gauge non - invariant terms such as @xmath185 are not allowed in the theory . instead , the gauge non - invariant perturbations can only appear through terms like @xmath186 which are magnetic monopole hopping operators , or from terms that hop visons .",
    "but then , since both _ matter field _ ( vison and magnetic ) excitations are gapped , these gauge non - invariant operators can not affect the low energy physics @xmath2 the @xmath80 liquid is stable to all gauge non - invariant perturbations @xmath2 while all gauge invariant perturbations are irrelevant in the rg sense .",
    "there is some work putting these arguments on a rigorous footing using the idea of quasi - adiabatic continuity .",
    "the idea , roughly stated , is to switch on a gauge non - invariant perturbation to the @xmath80 liquid with small coupling @xmath187 which has the effect of taking the ground state @xmath188 into @xmath189 .",
    "then one transforms all the operators @xmath190 in the theory in tandem with the switching on of the perturbation in such a way as to ( i ) preserve the locality of the operators and ( ii ) so that the expectation values of operators @xmath191 computed using the @xmath189 and the dressed operators are the same as those computed using @xmath188 and the undressed operators @xmath190 , up to corrections that vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] were able to show that , although the bare hamiltonian has small gauge non - invariant terms , the generators of gauge transformations are dressed after the addition of these perturbations to the bare model in such a way that a local gauge invariance survives in the dressed model . although unproven , this is thought to preserve also the gaplessness of the theory .      in the previous section , we explained that the @xmath80 liquid has the remarkable property of being stable to all local perturbations .",
    "this means that if the @xmath80 liquid is known to occur at some point in the space of all possible couplings , then one can vary the couplings in any direction in the space of couplings by a finite amount with the ground state remaining in this phase ( unless our original point is at a phase boundary ) .    while it might be possible to engineer a quantum system , perhaps a trapped cold atom system , that enters the @xmath80 phase , in the immediate future the most likely candidate systems that might host such a phase are certain pyrochlore magnets . assuming this to be the case , the stability of the @xmath80 liquid is of marginal relevance compared to the broader issue of whether the space of couplings explored by real materials accommodates the @xmath80 phase over a significant region in this space . in short ,",
    "it is useful to know whether the @xmath80 liquid is too finely tuned to be observed in at least one of the set of available materials .",
    "if a @xmath80 liquid were discovered we could , with reasonable confidence , pronounce that such phases are natural in parameter space . since a deconfined @xmath80 liquid phase has not been found in any of the pyrochlore magnets ( at the time of writing )",
    ", the question is worth asking from the perspective of microscopic models because it has a bearing on the discoverability of such phases and may provide some guidance to the experimental search .    to date",
    ", the naturalness of quantum spin liquids in general is largely an open question @xcite . for the particular problem of the naturalness of the coulomb phase in pyrochlore magnets ,",
    "the location of the @xmath80 liquid phase within the space of nearest - neighbour anistropic exchange couplings has been partially mapped out within a form of gauge mean - field theory for even electron ( kramers ) magnetic ions @xcite and odd electron ( non - kramers ) ions @xcite .",
    "the zero temperature gauge mean - field theory ( gmft ) employed by the authors of these papers is a variant of slave particle mean field theory which , in this case , involves the formally exact step of splitting the anisotropic exchange hamiltonian eqn .",

    "the latter bosonic fields are referred to as _ spinons _ in that paper and as magnetic monopoles here ( see section [ sec : conventions ] on naming conventions ) .",
    "one decouples the resulting interacting theory and solves self - consistently for the expectation values of the gauge field and monopole fields . whereas , the frustrated gauge theory discussed in section  [ sec : loops2gauge ] describes the physics of the quantum spin liquid within the spin ice manifold , the aim of the gauge mean - field theory is to capture further aspects of the physics of the full anisotropic spin model on the pyrochlore",
    "this is the reason why , in addition to a compact gauge theory , one has couplings to electrically charged matter fields and one can expect higgs phases , in addition to possible deconfined and confined phases .",
    "higgs phases have the property that the photon is gapped out by the condensation of the bosonic matter fields ; in some sense they are superconducting phases . the criteria for distinguishing different phases of the resulting gauge theory @xmath2 deconfined , confined and higgs phases @xmath2 are reminiscent of those in works on the mean - field theory of lattice gauge theories ( see for example , refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "the principal difference between the types of theories considered in that early work compared to those arising from the pyrochlore spin models is that the former have explicit gauge kinetic terms in the action whereas , in the latter , there are only matter - gauge couplings @xmath2 the gauge kinetic terms being solely generated by the dynamics of the monopole fields .",
    "secondly , the phase diagram of the gauge theory can be interpreted in the language of the microscopic spin / magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "specifically , the confined phase corresponds to some ordered spin ice phase while higgs phases are long - range ordered magnetic phases in which the moments have nonzero expectation value perpendicular to the local ising directions .",

    "such ising couplings tend to lift the degeneracy of the ice states @xcite and the stability of the @xmath80 liquid ultimately boils down , roughly , to a comparison of the energy scales of ring exchange and of the further neighbour ising couplings of the form @xmath201 . ref .",

    "a promising direction , motivated by slave fermion treatments of quantum magnets , comes from recent work showing that fractionalization is possible in @xmath184 dimensions either when @xmath80 gauge fields are coupled to a number @xmath206 of different types of fermion with a dirac dispersion @xcite ( where @xmath206 need not be very large ) or in the presence of a fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of these results , and perhaps a broader lesson , is that a deconfined @xmath80 liquid phase may arise in condensed matter models of _ real _ materials with two dimensional magnetism despite the fact that the minimal @xmath184 gauge - only @xmath80 theory is confining @xcite .    in @xmath173 dimensions ,",

    "the crystal field doublets of kramers ions are stable against small local crystal field deformations that may be caused by imperfect sample quality but the low energy anisotropy is not constrained to be ising - like and , indeed , rare earth kramers ions are known that span the range from ising to heisenberg to xy spins . while the extent of the available parameter space might disfavour kramers magnets as potential quantum spin ice candidates , it certainly does not rule them out and in fact , yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 , which we discuss next , is attracting much current interest in this respect .",
    "going back to some of the very earliest experimental studies of magnetic pyrochlore oxides , blte and co - workers had observed in yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 a broad specific heat bump at a temperature of about @xmath113 k , followed at lower temperature by a sharp specific heat peak at a critical temperature of @xmath303 k suggesting a transition to long - range order @xcite .",
    "it was not until until the late 1990s and early 2000s that this compound was reinvestigated @xcite , with the previously observed @xcite sharp specific heat transition confirmed . the work of ref .",
    "[ ] reported data from @xmath304yb mssbauer and muon spin relaxation ( musr ) measurements revealing a rapid collapse of the spin fluctuation rate just above @xmath305 .",
    "however , powder neutron diffraction did not find signs of long - range magnetic order below @xmath305 and musr found a temperature - independent muon spin depolarization rate below @xmath305 which was interpreted as a quantum fluctuation regime .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "[ ] provided strong evidence that the yb@xmath25 ion in yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 should be viewed as an xy system ( i.e. with @xmath257 tensor components @xmath306 ) , meaning that the magnetic moments have their largest magnetic response perpendicular to the local @xmath28 $ ] direction .",
    "a subsequent single - crystal neutron scattering study reported evidence for ferrimagnetic order @xcite , but this was soon contested by neutron depolarization measurements @xcite . in refs .",
    "[ ] and @xcite , neutron scattering measurements revealed the development of rods of scattering intensity along the @xmath39 directions , which was interpreted as the presence of quasi - two - dimensional spin correlations , an interesting and unusual phenomenon , assuming this interpretation to be correct , for a three - dimensional cubic system .",
    "these rods of scattering were found to be present at a temperature as high as @xmath307 k @xcite .",
    "the application of a magnetic field as low as @xmath308 tesla along the @xmath309 $ ] direction was found to induce a polarized three - dimensional order accompanied by spin waves @xcite .",
    "polarized neutron scattering measurements found , through an analysis of the neutron spin - flip ratio @xcite , a non - monotonic temperature evolution of the component of the local spin susceptibility , @xmath310 , parallel to the local @xmath28 $ ] direction .",
    "such behaviour is surprising for an xy system with @xmath306 , and the behavior observed for @xmath310 provided compelling evidence for strongly anisotropic effective exchanges at play in yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 , with a very strong effective ising exchange @xmath199 term as in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .    as discussed in section [ sec : materials_considerations ] , several works @xcite have endeavoured to determine the strength of the interactions in yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 .",
    "it appears that the effective coupling between pseudospins @xmath311 are in fact strongly anisotropic , with the largest one being indeed @xmath199 . among all values",
    "having been reported , it appears that the exchange parameters determined in ref .",
    "[ ] describe the bulk thermodynamic properties of the material reasonably well , at least down to @xmath312k @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the previously debated @xcite report of a long - range ferrimagnetic order @xcite in yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 has been reconfirmed @xcite . in this ferrimagnetic state , the magnetic moment are found to be predominantly aligned along one of the six @xmath313 cubic directions , but slightly splayed away from complete alignment , hence the label ferrimagnetic state . in this context , it is worth mentioning a very recent paper on the closely related yb@xmath15sn@xmath15o@xmath24 material @xcite . in this latter work ,",
    "specific heat , @xmath304yb mssbauer , neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation measurements on powder samples find a first order transition at @xmath314 k to a state that mssbauer and neutron diffraction suggest to be the above ferrimagnetic order , referred to as long - range `` splayed ferromagnetic '' order .",
    "the situation about the nature of the low - temperature state of yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 is thus rather confusing",
    ". it may be potentially illuminating to know that there is significant sample - to - sample variability among single crystal samples as inferred from the sharpness of the @xmath315 k specific heat peak @xcite . a recent extensive structural study investigation",
    "@xcite has identified at least one origin of these variations : single crystals grown via the floating zone technique show , compared to sintered powder samples , that up to 2.3 % of the non - magnetic ti@xmath26 sites get replaced by magnetic by yb@xmath25 .",
    "such `` stuffing '' of the transition metal ion site yb@xmath25 ions would introduce random exchange bonds and local lattice deformations and these may be at the origin of the mechanism affecting the stability of the magnetic ground state of a would - be structurally perfect yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 material . finally , we note that new and very recent muon spin relaxation results find no evidence for the development of static order in either powder or single crystal samples of yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 and , unlike in ref  [ ] find no rapid collapse of the yb@xmath25 spin fluctuation rate upon approaching the transition at @xmath316 k from above  @xcite .",
    "the overall situation with yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 is thus as follows .",
    "the effective exchange interactions are strongly anisotropic . on the basis of the determined @xcite and",
    "reasonably well validated @xcite exchange couplings , simple mean - field theory @xcite , classical ground state energy minimisation @xcite , and more sophisticated gauge mean - field theory calculations @xcite predict a conventional long - range ferrimagnetic order with the spins slightly splayed away from from the six cubic @xmath39 directions as recently reported for yb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and characterized by negligible quantum fluctuations @xcite . on the basis of these same calculations ,",
    "yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 is predicted to be located deeply in this semi - classical splayed ferromagnetic state , away from any phase transition boundaries with other conventional classical long - range ordered phases @xcite , or with the @xmath80 quantum spin liquid phase or yet with the unconventional quantum coulomb ferromagnetic ( cfm ) phase that refs .",
    "[ ] predict .",
    "it therefore seems likely that neither yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 nor yb@xmath15sn@xmath15o@xmath24 @xcite are good realizations of the sought @xmath80 liquid in a quantum spin ice setting .",
    "that said , with a tendency towards a broken discrete symmetry state ( i.e. ferrimagnetic order along one of @xmath313 directions ) characterized by gapped excitations throughout the brillouin zone , it is rather unclear why this material should be so sensitive to dilute disorder such as the one generated by yb@xmath25 stuffing on ti@xmath26 sites @xcite .",
    "one might then expect that if the observed amount of disorder and strength was greater than some critical value , that the resulting random frustration would then first drive the system into a semi - classical spin glass state .",
    "we are not aware of experimental studies having reported results suggesting a spin glass state in yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 .",
    "let us end by stating that further experimental studies of yb - based pyrochlores to search for either the @xmath80 liquid or the cfm phase are certainly most warranted .",
    "perhaps variants such as yb@xmath15ge@xmath15o@xmath24 , yb@xmath15zr@xmath15o@xmath24 or yb@xmath15hf@xmath15o@xmath24 could display interesting properties .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , we would expect a material finding itself in the @xmath80 quantum spin liquid state to be robust for a finite variation in the microscopic interaction parameters . in this context",
    ", it may be worth noting that the disordered yb@xmath15gasbo@xmath24 material does not display a sharp specific heat peak near @xmath317 k with its uniform susceptibility below 10 k characterized by an _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ curie - weiss temperature , @xmath318 k , unlike yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 for which @xmath276 is ferromagnetic - like with @xmath319 k @xcite . notwithstanding the random spin coupling caused by the gasb randomness on the transition metal ion site",
    ", a new generation of experiments ( e.g ac and dc susceptibility , neutron , mssbauer , musr measurements ) on yb@xmath15gasbo@xmath24 may prove interesting .",
    "we conclude by saying that the three materials discussed in this section , tb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 , pr@xmath15(sn , zr)@xmath15o@xmath24 and yb@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath24 are all described to some extent by the type of effective spin-1/2 hamiltonian of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) from which one obtains an exotic gapless @xmath80 spin liquid state with gapped electric and magnetic excitations , in addition to gapless photons .",
    "however , none of them have ( yet ) been found to be a clear realization of such a state .",
    "the wide variety of materials in the family of r@xmath15m@xmath15o@xmath24 pyrochlore oxides @xcite offer the possibility that one or more of these compounds may eventually prove compelling candidates to support the exotic physics of the @xmath80 spin liquid .",
    "in such a case , the experimental and theoretical lessons learned while investigating ( tb , pr , yb)@xmath15(ti , zr , sn)@xmath15o@xmath24 will undoubtedly prove useful .",
    "it would also perhaps be interesting to investigate in more detail the ar@xmath0s@xmath320 and ar@xmath0se@xmath320 ( a@xmath3cd , mg ) chalcogenide spinels in which the r@xmath25 rare - earth ion sits on a pyrochlore lattice @xcite . in the context of spin ice - like systems ,",
    "cddy@xmath0se@xmath320 likely has xy - like dy@xmath25 ions and could prove particularly interesting @xcite .",
    "in the foregoing sections , we have given an account of a theoretical proposal that effective spin-@xmath311 pyrochlore magnets , close to the ising limit , may have a spin liquid ground state with gapless photon - like excitations @xmath2 the so - called quantum spin ice state . on the purely theoretical front",
    ", there is strong evidence both from effective field theory and numerics that quantum fluctuations acting on the set of spin ice states can lead to just such a quantum spin liquid ground state .",
    "we can , moreover , make strong statements about the experimental observables in quantum spin ice .",
    "for example , unlike the case with many spin liquids , the gapless excitations carry spin one and couple directly to neutrons and would therefore be resolved as a sharp band of scattering intensity revealing the linear dispersion of the emergent photon .",
    "quantum spin ice exhibits a hierarchy of energy scales .",
    "the crossover between the quantum spin ice state and classical spin ice is controlled by the magnitude of the hexagonal ring exchange . at higher scales",
    ", there is a gap to the creation of spin ice defects @xmath2 the magnetic monopoles of ref .",
    "the schematic recipe for making a quantum spin ice is that the material exchange should be dominated by an ising coupling either coming purely from the balance of exchange parameters or assisted by the presence of an ising - like single - ion anisotropy .",
    "there should be weaker transverse exchange couplings which generate the effective ring exchange .",
    "for realistic values of the couplings in real materials , the hexagonal ring exchange can vary over many orders of magnitude but , inevitably , in rare - earth magnets it will commonly be 10 to 100 times smaller than @xmath199 . if this is the case , then it is important to consider the effect of competing couplings on the quantum spin ice state . the success of the experimental search for quantum spin ice is contingent on whether the spin liquid is natural in the space of available couplings within an effective spin-@xmath311 model : which consists of four linearly independent nearest neighbour exchange , the long - range dipole coupling , further neighbour exchange , higher order ring exchange and , potentially , couplings to non - magnetic degrees of freedom .    on the theoretical side , recent",
    "work has mapped out the phase diagram in the presence of the symmetry - allowed nearest neighbour exchange couplings using a type of gauge mean - field theory that allows one to study directly the fractionalized gauge theory degrees of freedom as well as conventional magnetically ordered phases @xcite . from an experimental point of view , the finding from this study is encouraging : the quantum spin liquid ground state lives in a significant region in the space of parameters .",
    "it would be interesting to look at the situation beyond mean field theory and to consider further the phenomenology of quantum spin ice as it crosses over into classical spin ice .",
    "one issue is how one might probe directly the gapped excitations in the quantum spin ice state and their classical analogues at higher temperature .    on the experimental side ,",
    "we have discussed in some detail four materials among the rare - earth pyrochlores which meet the simple criteria of having an ising anisotropy with weaker transverse fluctuations of different microscopic origin .",
    "unfortunately , while all four materials are associated with potentially very interesting open questions relating to the effect of disorder ( yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ) and the precise nature of the low temperature state ( tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and the pr@xmath25 based materials ) , none appears to exhibit cleanly the quantum spin ice phase that is the main topic of this review .",
    "the existence of these materials does , however , demonstrate the naturalness of magnets in the vicinity of classical spin ice with added quantum fluctuations described , at least partially , by a model such as in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "in addition , the last few years have seen considerable theoretical progress in developing a quantitative understanding of this class of materials . given that many magnets among the pyrochlore rare - earths remain to be investigated -",
    "a number have been mentioned in the preceding pages - and given our , now , reasonable mature understanding of the broad series of pyrochlore magnets , the next few years should see similar rapid progress in mapping out the experimental parameter space for these materials . optimistically , within a few years , we will understand that the materials discussed in this review are skirting around the edge of a real and significant region exhibiting spin liquid ground states and we will also have discovered examples of real pyrochlore materials that do live in that region and are the gapless spin liquids advertised in the title of this review .",

    "<S> the spin ice materials , including ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , are rare earth pyrochlore magnets which , at low temperatures , enter a constrained paramagnetic state with an emergent gauge freedom . remarkably , the spin ices provide one of very few experimentally realised examples of fractionalization because their elementary excitations can be regarded as magnetic monopoles and , over some temperature range , the spin ice materials are best described as liquids of these emergent charges . in the presence of quantum fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain , in principle , a quantum spin liquid descended from the classical spin ice state characterised by emergent photon - like excitations . whereas in classical spin ices the excitations are akin to electrostatic charges , in the quantum spin liquid these charges interact through a dynamic and emergent electromagnetic field . in this review , we describe the latest developments in the study of such a quantum spin ice , focussing on the spin liquid phenomenology and the kinds of materials where such a phase might be found . </S>"
