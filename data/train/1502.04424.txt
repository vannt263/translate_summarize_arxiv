    "it is known that the most important component of an adaptive optics ( ao ) system is the corrector , which is the deformable mirror ( dm ) .",
    "it can be a continuous face sheet or a surface formed by mirror segments @xcite . in the former the mirror boundary",
    "is fixed and voltage applied to any one actuator influences the neighbouring surface as well . in the case of the micro - machined membrane deformable mirror(mmdm ) [ 2 ] this influence can be as large as 60@xmath1 [ 3 ] .",
    "however , they are still preferred in many ao systems [ 4 - 8 ] because of their low cost and capability of achieving large stroke . a 37 channel mmdm from okotech , netherlands ,",
    "is being used by us at the udaipur solar observatory ( uso ) for its solar adaptive optics [ 9 - 11 ] ( sao ) system .",
    "although the mmdm is not common in many sao systems , its performance has been validated for solar observations[12 ] .    in an ao system , it is necessary to bias the dm in such a way that the stroke can be achieved in both positive and negative directions from the biased position . in general , this can be achieved by applying a constant voltage to all the actuators . in case of the mmdm , application of a constant voltage to all the actuators deforms the mirror to a shape often approximated to be parabolic [ 13 ] . however , such approximations do not hold , at points away from the centre .",
    "a dm , whose surface is distorted by applying a uniform set of voltage to its actuators , and placed in the optical setup at an angle to the beam will undoubtedly mimic a tilted parabolic mirror .",
    "such a tilted curved / parabolic mirror will induce optical aberrations such as defocus , astigmatism and coma @xcite . while defocus can be compensated by moving the imaging system , astigmatism and coma can not be corrected by a simple alignment .",
    "as the dm is also being used to compensate a turbulence - induced curvature term , it is necessary to determine the maximum angle of incidence at which the dm can be placed in the optical setup without introducing an additional set of aberrations than that which are inherent to the dm .",
    "otherwise , at relatively large angles of incidence , when the dm corrects an atmosphere - induced defocus ( curvature term ) , it will inevitably introduce astigmatism . in order to minimize this astigmatism ,",
    "an additional correction is required .",
    "this constraints the bandwidth of the system .    along with ` setup ' induced aberrations , intrinsic aberrations ( aberrations due to mirror s surface profile )",
    "are also very important . as the technical passport of the dm states that the initial figure of the dm is astigmatic upto 1.3 fringes(p - v)[14 ]",
    ", we would like to study the intrinsic aberrations as well .    in this paper",
    "we estimate , to a first order , the aberrations introduced in the optical system as a result of folding the beam using a dm with a bias voltage , for various angles of incidence .",

    "these aberrations increase with the increase in voltage as seen from their corresponding zernike coefficients ( cf . ,",

    "dependence of astigmatism and defocus on voltage and angle of incidence is derived empirically .",
    "it shows that defocus depends only on the voltage applied , whereas astigmatism depends both on the voltage applied and the angle of incidence .",

    "similarly , the wavefront error of the system at optimum focus varies with angle of incidence and it shows a similar trend as astigmatism . the system shows a considerable amount of wfe for angles of incidence @xmath127 9@xmath128 , with the wfe is worse than @xmath125/10 for any voltage .",
    "the technical document of the dm states that in the absence of any voltage the initial mirror figure is astigmatic upto 1.3 fringes . in the simulations ,",
    "this intrinsic aberration was modeled by utilizing ",
    "zernike fringe sag \" [ 17 ] .",
    "the terms z5 , z6 and , z12 , z13 refer to the first and third order astigmatism , respectively and were adjusted such that the initial difference between the tangential and sagital focus was 6 mm which corresponds to a wavefront error of 0.18  @xmath125 at @xmath125 = 550 nm .",
    "the obtained coefficients were assigned to the dm to make the surface astigmatic .",

    "this shows that the astigmatism arising from the surface figure needs to be corrected before using the dm in an optical setup .",
    "to compare the results from the zemax simulations , we carried out an experiment with the dm , using an f#15 coude telescope as the light feed . with a set of relay lenses the image was magnified by a factor of 2 . at the focal plane of the f#30 beam an artificial target",
    "was placed which was illuminated by sunlight . a lens of focal length 200 mm was used to collimate the light modulated by the target .",
    "the dm was placed in the collimated beam which reflects the beam towards an imaging lens of focal length 300 mm ( refer figure [ od ] ) .",

    "the target had an l shape pattern and it was observed that the vertical line was focused at one location while the horizontal line at another .",
    "this difference in the sagital and tangential focus is caused by astigmatism . to see if this astigmatism changes with the curvature of the dm , a uniform voltage was applied to all 37 actuators of dm from 0 to 225 dacs in steps of 25 dacs . for every voltage set , the tangential",

    "the optimum focus changes quadratically with the voltage applied .             220 pixels@xmath132 with a scale of 4.3 micron per pixel.,width=415 ]    the presence of an intrinsic astigmatism results in a poor image quality which can be judged visually as shown in figure [ images0 ] which also shows images taken by a plane mirror kept at the same location of the dm .",
    "astigmatism essentially arises due to different curvatures along different directions , hence as a first order trial we applied maximum voltage to a specific line of actuators alone and recorded the corresponding image as shown in figure [ images0]c . as a performance measurement , contrast of the images was estimated before and after correction for the entire image as well as for a few selected features as shown in figure [ images0]d .",
    "although the improvement in image contrast is nominal , it is evident that a specific voltage set is necessary to compensate for the degradation caused by the intrinsic astigmatism .",
    "the experiment was repeated by placing the dm at several angles of incidence and the tangential , sagital and optimum focus positions ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) were measured and the corresponding images were also recorded .",

    "the results are displayed in figure [ expt45 ] which is in agreement with those from the theory and simulations .",
    "interestingly , for angles less than 10@xmath126 the astigmatism remains nearly a constant with the applied voltage as seen from the theory and simulations .",

    "a deformable mirror is an important component in an adaptive optics system for compensation of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "a simple optical setup was made to study alignment issues and the intrinsic aberrations of a deformable mirror without employing any kind of wavefront sensor .",
    "the nature of the surface deformation under the influence of a uniform voltage to all the actuators of deformable mirror is obtained theoretically and given in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the equation is used to calculate the sag of the deformed / curved mirror .",
    "it is shown that radius of curvature of the deformable mirror is inversely proportional to the square of the voltage applied .",
    "furthermore , we also analytically estimated the defocus and astigmatism due to such a curved mirror , which are shown in equations ( 16 ) and ( 20 ) .",
    "simulations were performed with different voltages to the deformable mirror , which is kept at different angles of incidence .",
    "it is demonstrated that the estimated error in focus is solely a function of the applied voltage where the former has a quadratic dependence on the latter .",
    "the same is seen in astigmatism as well with an additional non - linear dependence on the angle of incidence .",
    "simulations also shows that coefficient of coma is negligible in comparison to astigmatism , could be due to the large f - number of dm .",
    "similar results were obtained from the experiment , wherein a 37 channel mmdm is placed in the collimated beam at different angles of incidence .",
    "the dm when placed at 0@xmath126 angle of incidence shows a finite amount of intrinsic astigmatism which does not vary significantly with the radius of curvature ( i.e. application of voltage to dm ) ; this is in agreement with the technical report provided by the manufacturer .",
    "it is also observed that the optimum focal plane position changes quadratically with voltage and does not exhibit a change of sign which concludes that the dm does not possess any intrinsic curvature that would change sign on application of voltages .",
    "we have also shown that the image quality degrades with the application of voltage and the astigmatism increases with the increase in angle of incidence .    from both , simulations and experiment it is demonstrated that when the dm is kept at angles greater than @xmath137 and voltages are applied to it",
    ", there is an induced astigmatism which increases in general with the angle of incidence as is also predicted by the theory .",
    "the close correlation between theory and experiment enable us to reach the following conclusion about the performance of dm .",
    "it shows that apart from the forces appearing due to charging of the capacitor , there are no other spurious deforming forces in the system and the optics of the dm can thus be regarded to have sufficient reliability .",
    "the detailed intensity distribution on the screen can also be computed by using equation ( 9 ) for the phase distortion due to deformation .",
    "it is concluded that in order to operate the dm in real - time to correct for atmospheric induced aberrations , it necessary to a ) keep the dm at a very small angle of incidence and b ) to derive a suitable voltage set that will compensate the intrinsic astigmatism as well .",
    "this voltage set can be simply added to any constant voltage set required to bias the dm surface , since the intrinsic astigmatism is independent of voltage ; it naturally facilitates using a suitable bias voltage in order to allow the membrane to move in either direction , which is being pursued and will be reported in future .    in practical situations , for wavefront correction",
    "the deformation may not be as simple as considered in the present investigations .",
    "however , the present study enables us to ascertain the inherent defects in the system which has to be kept in mind , while using the deformable mirror for phase distortion correction .",

    "<S> since the dm is to be used to compensate a turbulence - induced curvature term in addition to other aberrations , it is necessary to determine the aberrations induced by such ( curved dm surface ) an optical element when placed at an angle ( other than @xmath0 ) of incidence in the optical path . to this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate to a first order , the aberrations introduced by a dm as a function of the incidence angle and deformation of the dm surface . </S>",
    "<S> we record images using a simple setup in which the incident beam is reflected by a 37 channel micro - machined membrane deformable mirror for various angles of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that astigmatism is a dominant aberration which was determined by measuring the difference between the tangential and sagital focal planes . </S>",
    "<S> we justify our results on the basis of theoretical simulations and discuss the feasibility of using such a system for adaptive optics considering a trade - off between wavefront correction and astigmatism due to deformation . </S>"
