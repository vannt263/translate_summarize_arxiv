    "a sub - wavelength diameter optical fibre can be produced by heating and pulling a standard telecommunications fibre so that its waist diameter reduces from about a hundred micrometers to a few hundred nanometers @xcite .",
    "these tapered nanofibres have many uses and one of the most prominent is in the study of atomic samples and their optical properties at ultracold temperatures . by locally probing atomic fluorescence emitted from atoms trapped in a magneto - optical trap with high efficiency",
    ", they have been used to estimate the size and profile of the atomic cloud and other trap parameters @xcite and by recording the fluorescence spectrum of a small number of atoms close to the fibre surface , the effects of the short range van der waals interaction has been investigated .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when light travelling in such a fiber arrives at the tapered waist , the fiber diameter is smaller than the wavelength of the propagating light and it can no longer be confined in the fiber . a considerable fraction of the power propagates outside the surface boundary in the form of an evanescent field .",
    "this presents a novel strategy for trapping and guiding atoms near the fiber surface .",
    "the evanescent field represents an intensity gradient to a nearby atom , which leads to a dipole force that is either attractive or repulsive depending on whether the guided mode is red- or blue - detuned relative to the atom s dominant transition frequency",
    ".    if both a red- and blue - detuned fundamental mode are present in the fiber at the same time , the differing decay lengths of their respective evanescent fields result in a combined optical potential with a minimum at some distance from the fiber surface @xcite . this technique has been experimentally demonstrated for cold caesium atoms @xcite .",
    "the two - color trap can be made state insensitive by using red- and blue - detuned magic wavelengths @xcite and vector light shifts due to the elliptic polarization of the nanofiber modes can be removed by introducing counter propagating beams@xcite .",
    "the evanescent field around a tapered optical fiber offers a strategy for gaining near - field access to atoms and characterising potential trapping geometries@xcite , and exploring possibilities for their use in more involved settings @xcite is becoming a very active research area .",
    "the advantages of using fibers that are slightly bigger than single - mode fibers has also become a subject of great interest @xcite .    here",
    "we present a scheme for creating helicoidal potentials by combining a counter - propagating higher mode with a blue - detuned fundamental mode .",
    "these spiralling geometries can be produced by fixing the blue - detuned portion of the evanescent field in a cylindrically symmetric configuration while modifying the red - detuned portion of the evanescent field .",
    "the creation of helical potentials in free space has previously been considered @xcite , where they were generated by counter - propagating laguerre gaussian beams with counter - directed orbital angular momenta .",
    "one application of these spiralling potentials is , for example , the measurement of quantized rotations in atomic clouds @xcite .    in the next two sections we will first briefly introduce and review the modes that can propagate in an optical nanofiber and discuss the trapping geometries that can be constructed using the fundamental modes . in section [ sec : traps ] we present different trapping geometries which can be created by exciting a specific higher order mode in the fiber and in section [ sec : powertransfer ] we consider modification of the trapping geometry due to unintended excitation of nearby modes .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "an optical nanofiber can be thought of as a very thin optical fiber with a cylindrical silica core of radius @xmath5 and refractive index @xmath6 and an infinite vacuum clad of refractive index @xmath7 .",
    "it can be created by heating and pulling commercial grade optical fiber and tapering it down such that the refractive indices that determine the guiding properties of the fiber are that of the original silica cladding and that of the surrounding vacuum .",
    "such a thin fiber can only support a finite number of modes and the permitted propagation constants , @xmath8 , can be determined numerically @xcite .",
    "the field distributions associated with these modes can be found by solving maxwell s equations and here we will just give the expressions for the evanescent part of the electric field as they will be used throughout this paper .",

    "the constant @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 determines the power in a given mode .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 , which is the reciprocal of the decay length of the evanescent field , is defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the azimuthal index @xmath19 counts the number of @xmath20 phase changes of each component in a circle around the fiber axis and its sign determines the polarization of the mode .",
    "the fields described by eqns .   are not in general transversely polarized due to the @xmath21component which , for a set frequency and decreasing fiber radius , increases in magnitude ( relative to the transverse components ) .",
    "the transverse parts of the light beams described by these formulae are circularly polarized where the sign of the index @xmath19 gives the handedness of the polarization .",
    "linearly polarized solutions can be obtained by taking superpositions of the circularly polarized beams with equal amplitude and opposite handedness .",
    "the finite number of modes that can be supported by the fiber is determined by the ratio of the fiber radius to the wavelength of the propagating light . under the constraint @xmath22 ,",
    "the fiber can support only one mode , namely the fundamental mode he@xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the free space wave - number .",
    "the @xmath25 mode has a gaussian intensity profile in the fiber and the shape of its evanescent field depends on three fundamental parameters of the system , the wavelength of the light , the fiber radius and the refractive index of the medium .",
    "if the light in the @xmath25 mode is circularly polarized the intensity is azimuthally uniform .",
    "if the light is quasi - linearly polarised this uniformity is broken and two intensity maxima appear at opposite sides of the fiber @xcite .",
    "the intermediate cases of elliptical polarization interpolate between these two scenarios . the evanescent field decays faster for shorter wavelengths .",
    "an atom interacting with the evanescent field sees a dipole potential of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the atomic polarizability .",
    "it can be calculated from eqs .",
    "[ eq : evfields ] , and any intensity gradient results in a force whose sign is given by the detuning of the light field with respect to the atoms s dominant frequency .    a simple and stable ring trap in the transverse plane around the fiber can then be created by combining a blue- and a red - detuned evanescent field , which due to their differing decay lengths results in an intensity minima at some radial distance from the fiber surface @xcite .",
    "however , the attractive red - detuned intensity must overcome the blue - detuned one at a position where the van der waals potential is negligible .",
    "though the van der waals expression for an atom close to a curved dielectric surface is quite complex , in our scheme it is sufficient to approximate this attractive potential by the much simpler form for an infinite plane dielectric surface which is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29jm@xmath30 .",
    "this approximation is accurate for trapping minima close to the fiber surface @xcite .",
    "the radial position of the minimum can be adjusted by varying the powers in the red- and blue - detuned beams and in fig.[fig : he11potential ] ( a ) we show typical examples for a fiber of radius @xmath31 nm and two optical fields of @xmath32 nm and @xmath33 nm , which are red- and blue - detuned from the dominant d2 transition line in caesium at @xmath34 nm .",
    "the fiber radius was chosen to ensure the single mode condition is satisfied for both wavelengths and the power in the blue beam is kept fixed . by increasing the power in the red beam , a clear shift of the minimum towards the fiber surface is observed .",
    "nm fiber with @xmath35 mw in the blue - detuned beam and three different powers in the red - detuned beam : @xmath36mw ( most shallow ) , @xmath37 mw ( intermediate depth ) and @xmath38 mw ( deepest potential ) . panels ( b ) and ( c ) show the shape of the potential in three dimensions when the counter propagating red - detuned modes have parallel linear or orthogonal circular polarization respectively.,width=480 ]    it has recently been pointed out , by d. reitz and a. rauschenbeutel @xcite , that a double helix potential can be constructed in the evanescent field of a single mode optical fiber by the appropriate combination of three circularly polarized light beams .",
    "their proposal is based on the following principle ; the intensity along the propagation ( @xmath39 ) direction can be modified by using a counter - propagating beam configuration .",
    "if both beams are linearly polarized , then a simple standing wave pattern is formed .",
    "if the beams are circularly polarized , however , the standing wave formed by their superposition can take two different forms depending on whether the components have the same or opposite handedness . in the case where the counter - propagating components have the same handedness a standing wave with circular polarization and hence azimuthal symmetry in the intensity",
    "is formed .",
    "if the components have opposite handedness the standing wave is linearly polarized everywhere with the polarization direction rotating continuously through @xmath20 along the propagation direction , resulting in the two intensity maxima which form a double helix pattern with a periodicity of @xmath40 . the helical angle at the fiber surface is given by @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : he11potential ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the different shapes of such a potential in three dimensions for different polarisations in the red - detuned beam . in ( b ) the counter propagating red - detuned beams have parallel linear polarisation and the resulting potential has the form of a double helix @xcite . in ( c )",
    "the beams are orthogonally circularly polarized and one observes the creation of a potential that is periodic in the azimuthal and longitudinal directions and has similarities to having two one - dimensional optical lattices aligned along opposite sides of the fiber .",
    "the trapping frequency in the radial and azimuthal direction can be determined from @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of caesium and one finds typical values of @xmath44khz in the radial direction and @xmath45khz in the azimuthal one .",
    "if the parameter @xmath47 is increased beyond the value of 2.405 , simply by increasing the fiber diameter , three additional modes will successively be allowed to propagate .",
    "these are the @xmath46 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes . in the weakly guiding approximation",
    ", all three of these modes correspond to the @xmath48 mode which resembles the free space laguerre gaussian @xmath49 mode .",
    "the strong confinement of the mode by the nanofiber causes the @xmath48 mode to split into three modes with different propagation constants.the transverse intensity and polarization profiles of these three modes are shown in fig  [ fig : he21 ]",

    "the transverse part of the polarization of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes is linear with a @xmath20 rotation of polarization direction .",
    "since trapping geometries based on superpositions of the @xmath2 modes with both the @xmath46 and the @xmath25 modes are known to be very versatile @xcite , we present in the following an analysis of the trapping geometries that can be created by combining the @xmath46 mode and the @xmath25 fundamental mode .",
    "we will first consider a clean excitation and then include effects from unintended excitations of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes on these potentials . even though these unintended excitations change the trapping potential ,",
    "we show that this can actually lead to a new category of interesting geometries",
    ".    the @xmath46 mode can be either circularly or linearly polarized , where the linearly polarized one is a direct combination of right and left circularly polarized beams . in this case",
    "the transverse part of the polarization vector undergoes a @xmath20 rotation in a circuit around the fiber axis , while the polarization vector rotates in the opposite sense to the circuit taken so that the electric field vector is orthogonal to the fiber surface at four points .",
    "the evanescent field must be continuous across the fiber boundary at these points and this results in four intensity maxima along the azimuthal direction .",
    "these polarization vectors are shown superimposed on the intensity profile at one instant of time in fig  [ fig : he21](a ) .",
    "the circularly polarized @xmath46 mode has an azimuthally symmetric intensity profile ( not shown ) .    the variation in azimuthal intensity distribution for different polarization states of the @xmath46 mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : he21](d ) and four intensity maxima are clearly visible , which become more pronounced the less circularly polarized the beam is . in these figures",
    "the fiber radius is @xmath44 nm so that the @xmath46 mode is allowed to propagate for @xmath50 nm wavelength light in a silica fiber with a decay length of @xmath53 m    counter - propagating @xmath46 modes can broadly be achieved in three different ways , which lead to three different classes of standing wave pattern : ( a ) counter - propagating circularly polarized modes of the same handedness , ( b ) counter - propagating quasi - linearly polarized modes , and ( c ) counter - propagating circularly polarized modes of opposite handedness .",
    "two counter - propagating quasi - circularly polarized modes with the same handedness form a cylindrically symmetric standing wave ( case ( a ) ) , which can be used to create symmetric , equally spaced disconnected potential rings around the fiber , see fig .",
    "[ fig : he21potential](a ) . counter - propagating two quasi - linearly polarized @xmath46 modes ( case ( b ) ) , results in a standing wave with four intensity maxima per circuit of the fiber , which allows to create a regular lattice of traps with periodic boundary conditions around the fiber ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : he21potential](b ) . and",
    "two counter propagating @xmath46 modes with opposite quasi - circular polarization ( case ( c ) ) will combine to form a linearly polarized mode like that shown in fig  [ fig : he21](c ) with the polarization vectors rotating with propagation direction .",
    "this results is an evanescent field consisting of four intertwined helices , leading to a potential of the same shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : he21potential](c ) ) .",
    "it is experimentally conceivable , in principle , to switch between these different standing wave configurations by smoothly varying the polarization . in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] we show how the standing wave formed by two counter - propagating modes with the same quasi - circular polarization transforms into a two - dimensional lattice of traps by simply changing the polarization from circular to linear in each of the counter propagating modes simultaneously .",
    "the same method transforms the four helix standing wave into the lattice ( see middle row of fig .  [",
    "fig : transitions ] ) and in order to transform the four helix potential into the circularly symmetric standing wave one of the circularly polarized modes , say left circularly polarized , is held constant while the other is smoothly changed from right to left ( lower row in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] ) .    to use the above intensity patterns to trap caesium atoms",
    ", we consider introducing a @xmath54 nm fundamental @xmath25 mode , which , for the fiber parameters specified above , has an evanescent field decay length of @xmath55 m .",
    "the three dimensional geometries of these potentials for counter - propagating modes with identical circular polarization , counter - propagating modes with parallel linear polarization and for counter - propagating modes with orthogonal circular polarization are shown in in figs .  [",
    "fig : he21potential](a),(b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the distance between potential minima in the azimuthal direction is approximately a wavelength for the chosen parameters and depends on the radial position of the potential minimum , which can be modified by varying the ratio of power in the red - detuned field to that in the blue .",
    "here the potential minimum , for @xmath56 mw in the @xmath50 nm field and @xmath57 mw in the blue field , is located at @xmath58 nm from the fiber surface .",
    "plane as a circularly symmetric standing wave is transformed into the lattice ( upper row ) , a four helix standing wave is transformed into the lattice ( middle row ) and a circularly symmetric standing wave is transformed into the four helix standing wave ( lower row).,width=384 ]    fitting the radial profile in the vicinity of the trapping minimum to a harmonic oscillator potential @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mass of caesium , leads to an estimate of @xmath61khz for @xmath62 .",
    "the same method leads to an estimate of @xmath63khz for the azimuthal trapping frequency @xmath64 .",
    "note that the potential barriers between the traps can be smoothly removed in the longitudinal direction by lowering the power in one of the counter - propagating beams and independently in the azimuthal direction by changing the polarization of the mode from linear to circular .",
    "controlling the distribution of power between the different modes allowed to propagate in a nanofiber is an experimentally open problem .",
    "depending on the shape of the tapering region of the fiber and the quality of the beam injected initially , the modes present in the tapered waist can have different populations @xcite .",
    "simultaneous excitation of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath46 modes has been demonstrated @xcite , however a clean excitation of the @xmath46 mode has not yet been reported . we will therefore , in the following , look at the effects the presence of unintended excitation of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes has on the @xmath46 based potentials .",
    "so far , our scheme has assumed that we can solely excite the @xmath46 mode .",
    "however if power is passed from the @xmath46 to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes , the 4-helix potential will be modified and in general the potential changes from having four traps per azimuth to only two ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mixedmodes ] ) . the effect is stronger in the case of power transfer to the @xmath2 mode .",
    "this can be explained by referring back to fig .",
    "[ fig : he21 ] where it can be seen that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes can interfere destructively with the @xmath46 mode at two azimuthal positions where the polarizations match . in the case of the radially",
    "polarized @xmath2 mode this effect will be greater since the @xmath46 evanescent field is strongest where the polarization is radial . in this figure",
    "there is @xmath65 propagating in the fundamental mode and @xmath66 shared between the three higher modes .",
    "to ( a ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 in equal measure , ( b ) @xmath2 with the power in @xmath3 held constant and ( c ) @xmath3 with @xmath2 held constant .",
    "the ratios represent the fraction of power in each mode as @xmath2:@xmath3:@xmath46,width=432 ]",
    "by considering a tapered fiber with a diameter large enough to allow the next lowest modes above the fundamental mode to propagate , we have shown that a trapping potential in the shape of four intertwined helices can be created .",
    "this is achieved by combining red- and blue - detuned modes in a specific way and in particular by counter - propagating the red - detuned @xmath46 modes .",
    "this 4-helix configuration can be transformed into a rectangular lattice of traps wrapped around the cylinder by adjusting the polarisations of the counter - propagating beams .",
    "the potential barriers between traps in the azimuthal and longitudinal directions can be controlled independently .",
    "we have also considered the effects on this trapping geometry from unintended transfer of power from the @xmath46 to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "it is apparent that , were it possible to selectively couple to the available modes with strategically chosen relative intensities , a large number of interesting trapping geometries could be achieved .",
