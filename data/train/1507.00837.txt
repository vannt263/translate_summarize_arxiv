    "the neutron stars are believed to be composed of highly asymmetric matter , predominantly , the neutrons .",
    "of course , a small admixture of protons , electrons and muons are also present to maintain the @xmath4-equilibrium and charge neutrality .",
    "the various theoretical models have conjectured the possibility of existence of exotica , like , hyperons , bose condensates and quarks in the core of the neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the precise knowledge of the masses and the radii of the neutron stars are crucial in determining their compositions .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made along this direction @xcite .",
    "the masses of psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite are measured to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these measurements impose the lower bounds on the maximum mass of the neutron stars that a theoretical model must yield . in the absence of the exotic degrees of freedoms ,",
    "the criterion of maximum mass to be @xmath7 is readily satisfied by the theoretical models .",
    "the observational constraints on the maximum mass of neutron stars do not completely rule out the possibility of existence of the exotic degrees of freedom , but , the threshold transition densities for their appearance are pushed to 2.5 - 3.5 times the nuclear saturation density@xcite .",
    "the radii of neutron stars are known only poorly .",
    "the values of radii are quite sensitive to the assumed composition of the atmosphere .",
    "the radius @xmath8 km , for the neutron star with the canonical mass of @xmath9 , is found to be consistent with the observational analysis and the host of experimental data for finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "the equations of state ( eoss ) for the @xmath4-equilibrated baryonic matter , employed to determine the bulk properties of neutron stars , are usually constructed using the energy density functionals derived from the skyrme type effective forces or from an effective lagrangian density associated with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model .",
    "often , the energy density functionals are optimized using some selected experimental data on a key properties of the finite nuclei .",
    "occasionally , pseudo - data on nuclear and neutron matter are also used in the optimization protocols @xcite .",
    "the eos for the nuclear matter at a given density and the asymmetry can be viewed for simplicity as , @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the energy per nucleon , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the asymmetry with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being densities for the neutrons and the protons .",
    "the @xmath16 is the eos for the symmetric nuclear matter and @xmath17 is the symmetry energy coefficient at a density @xmath18 .",
    "the eos of the symmetric nuclear matter for the densities up to @xmath19 times saturation density ( @xmath20 ) is derived within the reasonable limits by combining the experimental data for the finite nuclei with the collective flow and kaon production data in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the poorly known density dependence of @xmath17 is the major source for uncertainty in the eos for the asymmetric matter .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is reasonably constrained only around the saturation density by the bulk properties of the finite nuclei .",
    "the understanding of density dependence of the @xmath17 is crucial as it controls the radii of neutron stars , the thicknesses of their crusts , the rate of cooling of neutron stars , and the properties of nuclei involved in r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy around the saturation density appears to be well correlated with the neutron - skin thickness @xmath21 in a heavy nucleus which can be experimentally measured .",
    "the @xmath21 is the difference between the rms radii for density distributions of the neutrons and protons in a nucleus .",
    "recently @xcite , the correlations of the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1pb nucleus with several bulk properties of neutron stars have been examined for the tov - min and fsu type models .",
    "the energy density functional for the tov - min corresponds to the skyrme type effective force and that for fsu is based on the extended rmf model .",
    "the correlation between neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1pb nucleus and the neutron star radius @xmath22 for tov - min is noticeably smaller than the one obtained for the fsu model .",
    "consequently , for the case of tov - min the properties of neutron stars can have larger variations at a fixed neutron - skin in @xmath1pb nucleus .",
    "this result is in concordance with the large uncertainties in the high density behaviour of the symmetry energy for the skyrme type energy density functionals @xcite .",
    "the tighter correlations of neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1pb nucleus with the several properties of the neutron stars within the rmf models seem to be stemming from the lack of freedom in the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density associated with these models .",
    "most of the rmf models describe the density dependence of the symmetry energy either in terms of the coupling of the isovector - vector @xmath18 mesons with the nucleons @xcite or by including only an additional cross - coupling of isosclar - scalar @xmath23 or isosclar - vector @xmath24 with the isovector - vector @xmath18 mesons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 or @xmath26 cross - coupling allows one to vary the neutron - skin thickness over a wide range without significantly affecting the quality of fit to the bulk properties of the nuclei such as the total binding energy and the charge radii@xcite .",
    "the differences in the high density behaviour of the symmetry energy and their consequences on the properties of the neutron stars arising due to the use of different cross - couplings have never been studied in detail .",
    "further , the inclusion of isovector - scalar @xmath0 mesons can modify the behaviour of the symmetry energy at high densities @xcite . in principal , the contributions from the various cross - couplings and the @xmath0 mesons should be included in a single rmf model .",
    "it has not been done so far due to lack of accurate experimental data on the finite nuclei and the neutron stars which govern the isovector part of the rmf model .",
    "a comprehensive study of variations in the properties of the neutron stars as a function of the neutron - skin thickness within the rmf models corresponding to different choices for the cross - coupling terms with and without the inclusion of the @xmath0 mesons may be highly desirable .",
    "such investigation would enable one to understand to what extent the inclusion of contributions from these various cross - couplings and the @xmath0 mesons within a single rmf model are necessary to describe simultaneously the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1pb and the various neutron star properties .",
    "in the present work , we would like to study the diversities in the properties of the neutron stars arising purely due to the uncertainties in the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density which governs the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy in the extended rmf model . towards this purpose , two different families of extended rmf models",
    "are obtained which mainly differ from each other in the choice for the cross - coupling term in the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density .",
    "one of the families of models includes @xmath27 cross - coupling while the other includes @xmath28 cross - coupling term in addition to the various linear and non - linear interaction terms already present in the commonly used rmf models .",
    "the contributions due the coupling of the @xmath0 mesons to the nucleons are also considered .",
    "the various coupling constants are so varied that they produce wide variations in the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1pb nucleus without affecting significantly the binding energies and charge radii of the finite nuclei .",
    "the various neutron star properties considered are the core - crust transition density , radius for the neutron stars with canonical mass , the tidal polarizability parameter and the threshold mass required for the enhanced cooling through direct urca process .",
    "some of these neutron stars properties at a fixed neutron - skin thickness differ significantly for two different families of the models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly outline the form of the effective lagrangian density for the extended rmf model .",
    "the procedure adopted to obtain different parameterizations for two different families of the model are described in sec .",
    "we also present in this section the results depicting the relationship between different coupling constants which govern the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density . in sec .",
    "iv , the various properties of the neutron stars obtained for the different families of models are compared for fixed values of neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1pb nucleus .",
    "the main conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "in the rmf models , nucleons interact through the exchange of isoscalar scalar @xmath23 , isoscaler vector @xmath24 and isovector vector @xmath18 mesons .",
    "the effective lagrangian density for the rmf model usually includes the cubic and quartic order non - linear self - interaction terms for the @xmath23 mesons in addition to the linear terms for the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath18 mesons which describe their interactions with the nucleons .",
    "the non - linear self - interaction terms for the @xmath23 mesons are added to yield reasonable values for the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "further , the rmf models are extended by including various cross - couplings terms for these mesons and self - interaction terms for the @xmath24 and @xmath18 mesons .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 cross - coupling terms enables one to vary the density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient and the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei over a wide range without affecting the other properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "most of the rmf models do not include the contributions from the isovector - scalar @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the bulk properties of the finite nuclei like binding energies and radii are not very sensitive to the presence of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "however , earlier investigations have stressed the need to include the contributions from the @xmath0 mesons for proper description of the highly asymmetric dense matter . @xcite .    the effective lagrangian density which includes the lowest order contribution from the @xmath0 mesons together with the various non - linear cross - coupling and self - interaction contributions already present in the extended rmf model , can be written as , @xcite ,    @xmath29    where the lagrangian @xmath30 describing the interactions of the nucleons through the mesons is , @xmath31\\psi_{j}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",

    "the cross interactions of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 mesons are described by @xmath45 which can be written as ,    @xmath46    one also needs to include the contributions from the electromagnetic interaction in the case of finite nuclei .",

    "the equation of motion for nucleons , mesons and photons can be derived from the lagrangian density defined in eq.([eq : lden ] ) .",
    "the contributions from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lem ] ) are included only for the case of finite nuclei .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eq : lnon - lin ] ) that there are five cross - coupling terms ; two of them are the cubic order terms corresponding to the @xmath51 and @xmath25 cross - couplings and the remaining are the quartic order terms .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath51 cross - couplings and self coupling of @xmath24 mesons play important role in varying the high density behaviour of the eoss and also prevents instabilities in them @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the self - coupling of @xmath18 mesons are not considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lrho ] ) , since , expectation value of the @xmath18 meson field is order of magnitude smaller than that for the @xmath24 meson field @xcite",
    ". the inclusion of the @xmath18 meson self interaction can affect the properties of the finite nuclei and neutron stars only very marginally @xcite . of the particular interest in the present work",
    "are the cross - coupling terms involving @xmath18 meson field which contributes to the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density in addition to the usual linear couplings of the @xmath18 and @xmath0 mesons to the nucleons .",
    "we shall mainly focus on the lowest order @xmath25 and @xmath26 cross - couplings whose strengths are determined by the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the quartic order @xmath25 cross - coupling strength @xmath54",
    "is set to zero .",
    "the values of @xmath55 or @xmath53 can be appropriately adjusted to yield wide variations in the density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient and the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei without affecting the other properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "two different families of the extended rmf models , named hereafter as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , are obtained .",
    "these families differ from each other in the choice for the cross - coupling term in the isovector part of the lagrangian density .",
    "the isovector part of the lagrangian density for the @xmath56(@xmath57 ) family is governed by the coupling parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath55(@xmath53 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the strengths for the coupling of the @xmath18 and @xmath0 mesons to the nucleons , respectively .",

    "[ eq : lnon - lin ] .",
    "the remaining parameters which correspond to the isoscalar part of the lagrangian density and the mass of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath18 mesons are kept fixed to that of the bka22 model @xcite .",
    "the bka22 model has been identified to satisfy various constraints related to symmetric nuclear matter , pure neutron matter , symmetry energy , and its derivatives @xcite .",

    ", the values for the symmetry energy coefficient at the saturation density @xmath60 , symmetry energy slope parameter @xmath61 , effective mass for the protons and neutrons and their differences are also presented .",
    "all these quantities are in mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we have collected in table [ tab3 ] the results for the various properties of the neutron stars obtained for a few representative cases corresponding to the @xmath56 and @xmath57 families .",
    "the values of neutron - skin thickness for the @xmath1pb nucleus are also listed .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained for the set1 with those for set3 or set2 with set4 readily gives a crude estimate about the variation in the properties of the neutron stars across the different families of models at a fixed neutron - skin thickness .",
    "similarly , the idea about the effects of @xmath0 mesons within the same family can be obtained by comparing the results for set1 with set2 or set3 with set4 .",
    "it may be easily verified from table [ tab3 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] - [ fig11 ] that the values of core - crust transition density @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the tidal polarizability parameter @xmath64 for both the families of the models can differ significantly at a fixed value of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , instead of the @xmath27 and @xmath26 cross - couplings as included separately in the different families of the models , a linear combinations of these cross - couplings in a single model would allow one to adjust the properties of the neutron stars over a wide range at a fixed value of the neutron skin thickness in a heavy nucleus , like , @xmath1pb .",

    "both the families of models include the contributions from the @xmath0 meson in addition to several linear and non - linear interaction terms already present in the commonly used rmf models .",
    "the several parameterizations for each of the families of the models are so obtained that they yield wide variations for the neutron - skin thickness @xmath21 in the @xmath1pb nucleus without affecting much the other bulk properties of the nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath0 meson produces required splitting in the effective mass for the neutrons and protons and also enables us to obtain smaller neutron - skin thickness .",
    "we compare the various properties of neutron stars obtained for the @xmath65 and @xmath57 families .",
    "the properties of neutron stars considered are the core - crust transition density , radius , red shift , tidal polarizability parameter and threshold mass required for the enhanced cooling through direct urca process .",
    "most of these properties of the neutron stars at a fixed @xmath21 are noticeably different for two different families of the models .",
    "these differences are pronounced at smaller values of @xmath21 which can be attributed to the differences in the density dependence of the symmetry energy resulting due to different cross - coupling terms . for @xmath66 in the @xmath1pb nucleus ,",
    "consistent with the current experimental data on dipole polarizability , the red - shift and the radius of neutron stars with mass @xmath9 differs by about @xmath67 for the two families of models .",
    "such differences are quite significant ( @xmath68 ) for the tidal polarizability parameter for the neutron stars with mass @xmath2 and the threshold mass required for the direct urca process to occur in the neutron stars .",
    "the values of the core - crust transition density also differs reasonably across the different families of the models .",
    "we may thus say that the simultaneous inclusion of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 cross - couplings in the extended rmf model would enhance its flexibility to accommodate the variations in the properties of the neutron stars at a given neutron - skin thickness .",
