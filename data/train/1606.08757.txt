    "an important function of the membrane - bound organelles along the endocytic and secretory transport pathways of eukaryotic cells is the sorting of proteins and lipids traveling across the cell .",
    "this sorting occurs predominantly through molecular recognition during individual transport steps , namely the packing of these molecules into protein - coated vesicles budding from a donor compartment , and the fusion of these vesicles with an acceptor compartment .",
    "we have developed a stochastic model for the sorting of membrane components based on selective vesicle budding and fusion , which identifies the occurrence of perfect and irreversible sorting as a first passage process controlled by stochastic fluctuations .",
    "we found two qualitatively distinct regimes of fast and slow sorting for high and low values of the ratio of vesicle budding to fusion rates .",
    "when analyzing the structure of the sorted compartments , we found again two distinct regimes with a dispersed ( vesicular ) phase and a condensed ( compartmentalized ) phase for high and low values of the ratio of budding to fusion rates .",
    "we conclude that the rapid sorting of membrane components into well - defined compartments requires a subtle balance between vesiculation and fusion rates , for which we provide a phase diagram .",
    "the hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their compartmentalization into specialized membrane - bound organelles .",
    "these organelles carry out specific functions and are characterized by specific physical and biochemical properties , while constantly exchanging components with one another through the budding and fusion of small transport vesicles  @xcite .",
    "exchange between organelles is tightly regulated , leading to directional intracellular transport along well - defined routes , the secretory and endocytic pathways  @xcite .",
    "one important function of the intracellular organelle network is the sorting of membrane components which are then dispatched to their proper location  @xcite .",
    "this process is regulated by molecular recognition during vesicle budding and fusion , and involves different kinds of membrane - associated proteins .",
    "the formation of the protein coats that control vesicle budding  @xcite and the activity of tethers and snares that mediate vesicle fusion  @xcite are affected by membrane composition .",
    "this machinery is orchestrated by membrane components that define the identity of the organelles membrane , such as members of the rab gtpases family  @xcite . in particular , rabs control the homotypic fusion between membrane compartments with similar composition of rabs , both in the endosomal network  @xcite , and in the golgi apparatus  @xcite .",
    "although many of the molecular players contributing to the intra - cellular organization have been identified , we are still far from understanding how the complex and dynamical intra - cellular architecture emerges from the self - organization of individual molecules  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between vesicle budding and fusion poses a number of interesting questions regarding how organelles can robustly maintain distinct compositions while constantly exchanging material .",
    "several theoretical studies have investigated such questions in recent years , mostly focusing on steady - state , time averaged properties of dynamical compartments exchanging material  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in particular that given sufficiently strong specificity of the budding and fusion transport mechanisms , one expects spontaneous symmetry breaking and the appearance of stable interacting compartments with distinct compositions  @xcite .",
    "the inherently stochastic nature of intracellular transport however has been much less explored  @xcite .",
    "the importance of fluctuations appears clearly when considering the typical organelle size along the transport pathways .",
    "an endosome or a golgi cisterna has a membrane area of about @xmath0 , while the transport vesicles responsible for exchange within and between compartments are typically of diameter about @xmath1 .",
    "the budding / fusion of a few tens of vesicles is thus enough to completely renew the membrane composition of a compartment .",
    "indeed , the size and composition of early endosomes show strong fluctuations , which are correlated with budding and fusion events  @xcite .",
    "such system must thus be described as a stochastic process undergoing strong fluctuations around an average state . in this study",
    ", we develop a fully stochastic description of the sorting of membrane components by mean of the emission and fusion of vesicles targeting specific membrane components , a process of direct relevance to intra - cellular organization .",
    "we show that both the average sorting time of two membrane species initially mixed into a single compartment , and the size distribution of the sorted compartments depend critically on the ratio of vesicle fusion to budding rates .",
    "we conclude that the efficiency of a sorting mechanism designed to sort an initially mixed compartment into a few well defined pure compartments requires an optimization of the relative rates at which these two transport processes occur .",
    "in this paper we use the term organelle in a very general sense , referring to any membrane - bound compartment capable of vesicular exchange .",
    "transport vesicles are assumed to have a fixed area @xmath2 , taken as the unit size of the system .",
    "we consider that the organelle size , defined by its area @xmath3 , can vary only through the budding and fusion of vesicles or other organelles .",
    "it is thus defined as an integer number of vesicles @xmath4 , which decreases by steps of unit size one for each vesicle budding , and increases by an integer number of unit one steps during fusion .    -",
    "the membrane of different organelles contain different types of lipids and proteins that can coexist in a given membrane and whose exchange between organelles is regulated  @xcite .",
    "some proteins are permanently embedded within the lipid bilayer and are transported with the lipids , while others ( such as rab gtpases  @xcite ) undergo energy consuming cycles between active ( membrane - bound ) and inactive ( cytosolic ) states .",
    "all these molecules define the global chemical identity of membranes .",
    "we account for membrane variability in a coarse - grained and simplified way by defining two generic types of membrane ( @xmath5 ) , and we allow a particular membrane compartment to contain a mixture of type @xmath6 and @xmath7 membranes . for simplicity , we coarse - grain the membrane composition at the size of a transport vesicle .",
    "a compartment s membrane thus consists of @xmath8 sites that can be either of type @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and its composition is completely defined by the number of sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 of type @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "- both vesicle emission from a donor compartment and vesicle fusion with an acceptor compartment are highly specific for lipids and proteins . in vivo ,",
    "vesicular emission is controlled by coat complexes that assemble at the membrane in composition - specific fashion and bend it into the shape of a vesicle  @xcite .",
    "the fusion mechanisms are specifically influenced by interactions with membrane components including matching pairs of snares  @xcite .",
    "this is implemented here in the following way . in the analytic part of the work",
    ", we consider that vesicle emission only affects the type @xmath7 ( mature ) membrane component , and is characterized by a rate ( per site ) @xmath11 where the parameter @xmath12 controls the vesicular emission rate , @xmath13 represents the selectivity of vesicle emission for the @xmath7 component , and @xmath14 is the fraction of @xmath7 component in the membrane .",
    "we extend this model to allow the vesicular export of both membrane components in the numerical simulation . as explained in the _ methods _ section ( selectivity of vesicle emission ) ,",
    "amounts to considering that coat formation occurs at a rate @xmath12 , that a coat selectively bud - off from the compartment if it interacts with a membrane of type @xmath7 , and that the affinity of the coat to type @xmath7 component is characterized by a boltzmann factor @xmath15 .",
    "the average flux of vesicle leaving an organelle of size @xmath8 and composition @xmath16 per unit time is thus @xmath17 .",
    "regarding vesicle fusion , we implement a general homotypic fusion mechanism based on the idea that fusion is possible only between membrane sites of the same type .",
    "we assume that any two compartments 1 and 2 of mixed compositions @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the system meet at a rate @xmath20 ( independent of their size ) , and fuse with a probability given by the probability that two random sites of their membranes are identical , leading to the average fusion rate between two compartment : @xmath21 we consider an isolated system initially made of a single organelle containing a mixture of @xmath6 and @xmath7 membrane types , and we study the dynamics of the stochastic process by which selective vesicle budding and homotypic fusion lead to pure @xmath6 and @xmath7 compartments .",
    "the main control parameters are the ratio of fusion to budding rates @xmath22 , the initial size @xmath8 of the mother compartment , and its initial composition @xmath23 .",
    "we study the process sketched in , seeking to answer two questions : ( 1 ) what is the mean first passage time to irreversible separation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 components , and ( 2 ) what is the size distribution of the pure @xmath6 and @xmath7 compartments resulting from the sorting process .",

    "a `` mother '' compartment contains both @xmath6 and @xmath7 membrane components , which are individually exported by vesicle budding",
    ". secreted vesicles with the same identity fuse with one another to create pure @xmath6 and @xmath7 compartments , and may fuse back with the mother compartment with a composition - dependent rate .",
    "pure @xmath6 and @xmath7 compartments do not fuse together .",
    "stochastic fluctuations lead to the permanent separation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 components into two independent distributions of pure compartments.,width=642 ]      we consider an isolated system with a fixed number @xmath24 and @xmath25 of membrane sites of type a and b , which are initially mixed into a single compartment , and study the sorting of a and b component by selectively extracting b from the mixed compartment through vesicle budding .",
    "the sorting process is slowed down by the fact that newly - formed b compartments can fuse back with the mixed compartment , but within the homotypic fusion scheme ( ) , pure @xmath6 and @xmath7 compartments ( _ i.e. _ @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) can not fuse together , so that perfect and permanent sorting will necessarily be achieved at some point , when stochastic fluctuations completely remove all b components from the mother compartment . in this section ,",
    "we first derive the mean sorting time analytically by making the simplifying assumptions that all @xmath7 components removed from the mother compartment aggregate into a single , pure @xmath7 compartment .",
    "this is done both in the continuous ( infinite size ) approximation and in the case where finite - size effects are relevant .",
    "we identify two distinct regimes , fast and slow sorting , as a function of the ratio @xmath22 of fusion to budding rates and of the fraction @xmath28 of @xmath7 sites in the system .",
    "the assumptions that there are only two compartments in the system is justified by the fact that the average fusion flux toward the mother compartment from a size distribution @xmath29 of pure @xmath7 compartment of size @xmath30 is only sensitive to the total size @xmath31 of the distribution .",
    "however , the size of the concentration jump following each fusion event is influenced by the actual size distribution , so the assumption should only be qualitatively valid if the size distribution is broad .",
    "comparison of our analytical results with stochastic numerical simulations show that this subtlety can to some extent be accounted for by including the probability that a budded vesicle directly fuses back with the mother compartment .",
    "the full steady - state size distribution of the pure @xmath7 compartments , in which budding and fusion also occurs , is discussed in the next section .      if the system size is large : @xmath32 , the number of @xmath7 sites @xmath33 , or equivalently the fraction of @xmath7 site in the mother compartment , @xmath34 may be treated as a deterministic continuous variable between fusion events . using ,",

    "for instance , if @xmath41 , as in eq.[budding ] , this leads to @xmath42 .",
    "this is an artifact of the continuous model , and we will see in the next section that @xmath40 is always finite as long as @xmath43 @xmath44 in more realistic discrete models .",
    "in addition to the continuous decrease of @xmath16 through vesicle emission , the compartment containing all the emitted vesicles may fuses back with the mother compartment at any instant with a probability density @xmath45 . this defines a stochastic process where @xmath35 continuously decreases towards zero , but is submitted to stochastic jumps that reset the system to its initial configuration @xmath23 . since the total number of jumps is independent of the waiting time between each jump , the average time ( mean first passage time - mfpt ) to complete separation may be written @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mean number of jump and @xmath48 is the mean waiting time between two jumps .    as shown in the _ methods _ section ( _ mean sorting time in the continuous limit _ ) , the mean first passage time to full separation can be expressed as : @xmath49 - 1\\right ) \\label{final_tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "one thus expects the sorting time to cross over from being insensitive to the fusion rate @xmath20 when @xmath50 , to increasing exponentially with the fusion rate when @xmath52 .",

    "the previous derivation was done assuming that there are only two compartments in the system , the mixed `` mother '' compartment , containing a fraction @xmath35 of @xmath7 components , and the pure @xmath7 compartment containing all the emitted vesicles .",
    "however , there are temporarily three compartments in the system just after a vesicle budding event , and the emitted vesicle has a probability @xmath56 to fuse back with the mother compartment rather than with the @xmath7 compartment .",
