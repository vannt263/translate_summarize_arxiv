    "drell - yan lepton pair production by incident charged pions is still the only available hadronic process that allows for the extraction of the internal `` partonic '' structure of the pion in the valence region .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data for this process are rather scarce @xcite .",
    "several analyses of the available data have been performed using leading order ( lo ) or next - to - leading order ( nlo ) partonic cross sections , with the goal of extracting the parton distribution functions of the pion @xcite .",
    "the resulting lo or nlo valence distributions showed a linear ( @xmath0 ) or slightly faster fall - off at high @xmath1 , at odds with theoretical predictions based on perturbative qcd @xcite , and calculations using dyson - schwinger equations @xcite , which prefer a much softer behavior @xmath2 at high @xmath1 . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .    in a recent analysis",
    "@xcite we showed that a valence distribution with a fall - off @xmath3 is in fact well consistent with the drell - yan data , _ if _ large logarithmic contributions arising near the threshold for the partonic reaction are taken into account to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "these so - called `` threshold logarithms '' strongly enhance the partonic cross section near threshold , so that a softer valence distribution is sufficient to describe the data .",
    "we also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the available pionic drell - yan data are not able to completely determine the valence parton distribution of the pion .",
    "the data are almost equally well described by a valence distribution that carries 60 % , 65 % or 70 % of the pion s momentum at a low input scale @xmath4 gev , as long as it behaves approximately as @xmath5 at high @xmath1 .",
    "the quality of three corresponding fits that we performed in @xcite only differed by about one unit in @xmath6 .",
    "this uncertainty in the valence momentum is also manifest in the earlier nlo analyses . at @xmath7",
    "gev the valence parton distribution of smrs @xcite carries 46 % of the pion s momentum , whereas the valence distribution of grs @xcite carries only 40 % , although both distributions describe the same data sets equally well .",
    "the origins of this ambiguity are the large overall systematic uncertainties of the drell - yan data .",
    "these uncertainties can be best discussed by introducing an additional @xmath8-factor that multiplies the theoretical cross section .",
    "the numerical value of this @xmath8-factor is strongly correlated with the first moment of the chosen valence distribution ( see table i of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . hence , pion drell - yan data with a well understood normalization",
    "are urgently needed to really pin down the pion s valence distribution .",
    "the upcoming fixed - target @xmath9 drell - yan experiment  @xcite at compass is hoped to resolve this issue . in this paper , we present detailed predictions for the rapidity - integrated as well as the rapidity - differential cross section for the kinematics relevant at compass . in the light of our study",
    "@xcite , it is expected that threshold logarithms will also play a significant role for the drell - yan cross section at compass and lead to large corrections .",
    "we will therefore base our predictions on the threshold resummation technique .",
    "we note that there have been numerous earlier phenomenological applications of threshold resummation in the drell - yan process  @xcite , both for fixed - target and for collider energies . the specific application to @xmath9 scattering , and",
    "the resulting phenomenological studies for compass , are the new elements of this paper .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the basic framework for the calculation of the rapidity - differential drell - yan cross section is presented .",
    "we discuss fixed - order corrections as well as the full next - to - leading logarithmic resummation of threshold logarithms .",
    "this includes the discussion of mellin and fourier moments of the cross section , which are useful tools for threshold resummation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present phenomenological results for the kinematic regime of the drell - yan experiment at compass .",
    "we show both rapidity - integrated and rapidity - differential cross sections .",
    "we finally draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "we follow in this section the framework laid out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where threshold resummation effects in @xmath10-boson production at hadron colliders were studied .",
    "we consider the inclusive cross section for the production of a @xmath11 pair of invariant mass @xmath12 and rapidity @xmath13 in the process @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the four - momenta of the initial - state particles .",
    "according to the relevant factorization theorem , at high @xmath12 the rapidity - differential cross section may be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 the hadronic center - of - mass energy squared .",
    "the coupling @xmath20 equals @xmath21 for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 scattering processes which we are interested in , where @xmath25 denotes the quark s fractional electromagnetic charge . in terms of the rapidity",
    "@xmath13 the lower bounds of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 integrals are @xmath28 with @xmath29 . the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) runs over all partonic channels , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the corresponding parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the pion and the proton , and @xmath32 the hard - scattering functions .",
    "the latter can be computed in perturbation theory as series in the strong coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "the parton distribution functions as well as the hard - scattering functions depend on the factorization and renormalization scales , which we choose to be equal and collectively denote as @xmath34 .    at leading order",
    "@xmath35 only the quark - antiquark annihilation channel @xmath36 contributes , for which one has in our normalization @xmath37 at next - to - leading order , apart from the @xmath38 corrections to the @xmath22 process , also additional processes contribute to the cross section , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the nlo partonic cross sections in the @xmath41 scheme , which is the scheme we adopt throughout this work , can be obtained from  @xcite .",
    "they are also collected in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . @xcite . ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the drell - yan cross section receives large logarithmic corrections near the threshold for the partonic reaction  @xcite .",
    "this threshold is defined by @xmath42 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the momentum fractions of the partons participating in the hard - scattering reaction . as @xmath43 increases towards unity ,",
    "most of the initial partonic energy is used to produce the virtual photon .",
    "therefore , little phase space remains for real - gluon radiation , while virtual - gluon diagrams may still contribute fully .",
    "the infrared cancellations between the virtual and the `` inhibited '' real - emission diagrams then leave behind large logarithmic corrections to @xmath44 . the leading terms among the resulting threshold logarithms are of the form @xmath45 at the @xmath46th order of perturbation theory .",
    "subleading terms are down by one or more powers of the logarithm .",
    "the threshold logarithms become particularly important when @xmath47 , the hadronic analog of @xmath43 , is large , which is generally the case in the fixed - target regime . the fact that the parton distribution functions are steeply falling functions of @xmath26 or @xmath27 emphasizes the threshold region in the cross section even for values of @xmath48 substantially smaller than one . in this kinematic regime",
    "the logarithms @xmath49 compensate the smallness of @xmath50 , and it becomes necessary to resum the large corrections to all orders in the strong coupling .",
    "such `` threshold resummation '' has originally been derived for the drell - yan process and deep inelastic scattering a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the techniques developed in these seminal papers have been extended and successfully applied to the resummation of large logarithmic contributions in numerous other hard qcd processes .",
    "threshold resummation may be achieved in mellin moment space , where phase space integrals for multiple - soft - gluon emission decouple . for the rapidity dependent cross section ,",
    "it is convenient to also apply a fourier transform in @xmath13 @xcite ( alternatively , one can also use a double mellin transform  @xcite ) . under combined fourier and mellin transforms of the cross section ,",
    "@xmath51 the convolution integrals in ( [ eq : factorization ] ) decouple into ordinary products @xcite . defining the moments of the pdfs , @xmath52 and introducing the corresponding double transform of the partonic hard - scattering cross sections , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the partonic center - of - mass rapidity ,",
    "one finds : @xmath55 the double transform thus factorizes the pdfs and the perturbatively calculable hard - scattering functions .",
    "the leading order contribution to the hard - scattering function @xmath56 is easily calculated by making use of the relations @xmath57 we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dy_lo ] ) for the fourier transform of @xmath58 : @xmath59 here we have appropriately averaged over the two possible solutions for the integral . the emerging factor @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cosine ] ) is just the lo hard - scattering contribution to the rapidity-_integrated _ drell - yan cross section .",
    "hence , the fourier transform of the lo rapidity - differential partonic cross section is equal to the lo rapidity - integrated partonic cross section times @xmath61  @xcite . in the near - threshold limit @xmath62",
    "this cosine factor becomes subleading : @xmath63 as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , even at higher orders the dependence of the double moments @xmath64 on @xmath65 becomes subleading near threshold , whereas the @xmath66-dependence is identical to that of the rapidity - integrated cross section .",
    "therefore , the resummed expression for @xmath64 is equal to that for the total ( rapidity - integrated ) cross section .",
    "it was shown in ref . @xcite that keeping the cosine term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cosine ] ) in the resummed @xmath67 slightly more faithfully reproduces the rapidity dependence at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "this can be easily achieved by writing the cosine as @xmath68 which , when combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmanm1 ] ) , leads to a sum of two terms with mellin moments shifted to @xmath69 .",
    "threshold resummation for the drell - yan process results in the exponentiation of the soft - gluon corrections .",

    "@xcite .    since the perturbative running coupling @xmath78 diverges at @xmath79 , eq .",
    "( [ resummed ] ) as it stands is ill - defined .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the expression shows factorial divergence , which in qcd corresponds to a powerlike ambiguity of the series @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that the factorial divergence appears only at nonleading powers of the momentum transfer .",
    "the large logarithms we are resumming arise in the region @xcite @xmath80 in the integrand of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ resummed ] ) .",
    "one therefore finds that to nll they are contained in the simpler expression @xmath81 for the second term in eq .",

    "we note that an alternative possibility for dealing with the landau singularity is to perform the resummation directly in @xmath43-space @xcite .",
    "we match the resummed cross section to the nlo one by subtracting the @xmath108 expansion of the resummed expression and adding the full nlo cross section @xcite .",
    "this `` matched ''",
    "cross section consequently not only resums the large threshold logarithms to all orders , but also contains the full nlo results for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels . we will occasionally also consider a resummed cross section that has not been matched to the nlo one .",
    "we will refer to such a cross section as `` unmatched '' .",
    "we now present our numerical results for the drell - yan cross section at compass .",
    "we will consider both the rapidity - integrated and the rapidity - differential hadronic cross section .",
    "our main goal is to investigate the size of the threshold resummation effects .",
    "the @xmath109 beam foreseen at compass has an energy of @xmath110 gev .",
    "it is scattered off a proton target at rest , so that the resulting center - of - mass energy of the system is @xmath111 .    for the pionic parton distribution functions we use the ones for the `` preferred fit '' of our previous study  @xcite .",
    "we remind the reader that these were extracted from a fit to the earlier @xmath9 drell - yan data @xcite , using nll threshold - resummed cross sections in the @xmath41 scheme . for the proton target we use the nlo ( @xmath41 scheme ) cteq6 m @xcite parton distributions . unless stated otherwise , we choose the renormalization and factorization scales as @xmath112 .",
    "we start by considering the differential cross section @xmath113 , integrated over all rapidities , to show the relevance and the validity of the resummation effects over the whole range of the invariant mass @xmath12 . here",
    "we ignore for simplicity charmonium and bottonium resonances in the lepton pair spectrum , whose contributions are dominant for resonant invariant masses , and calculate only the smooth ( continuum ) part of the cross section .",
    "figure  [ fig : compass_int ] shows the cross section @xmath114 at @xmath115 at fixed order ( lo and nlo ) , as well as for the nll - resummed case .",
    "it can be seen that resummation leads to a significant enhancement of the cross section over lo , which increases strongly with invariant mass .",
    "this becomes even more apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : compass_int_k ] , where we show the `` k - factor '' , defined as the ratio of the cross section to the lo one : @xmath116 the `` k - factor '' is plotted for the nlo and the nll - resummed result .",
    "we also expand the _ unmatched _ resummed cross section in powers of @xmath33 .",
    "the results for the first , second and third order expansion are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compass_int_k ] .",
    "one can see that in the fixed - target regime higher orders ( beyond nlo ) still make large contributions to the cross section , especially at high invariant mass @xmath12 .",
    "this finding is in line with that in the earlier study  @xcite for @xmath117-scattering .",
    "we also observe that the exact nlo cross section agrees extremely well with the first order expansion of the unmatched resummed result .",
    "this demonstrates that the logarithmic contributions from soft gluon radiation , which we resum to all orders , give by far the most important contribution to the cross section , not only very close to threshold as @xmath118 , but also for rather moderate values of @xmath48 .",
    "next , we present the results for the rapidity distributions @xmath119 .",
    "as mentioned above , charmonium and bottonium resonances complicate the calculation of drell - yan cross sections .",
    "therefore usually only lepton pairs with invariant mass @xmath12 between the @xmath120 and @xmath121 resonances and above the @xmath121 are considered .",
    "since the drell - yan event rate decreases rapidly with @xmath122 , it may not be possible to measure it above the @xmath121 resonance in the medium - energy fixed - target regime accessed by the compass experiment .",
    "we therefore make predictions for @xmath123 and @xmath124 , corresponding to @xmath125 gev and @xmath126 gev , respectively .",
    "our results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : rap_03 ] and [ fig : rap_045 ] . again the resummed cross section and the fixed - order nlo and lo ones are shown .",
    "as before , we expand the unmatched resummed result in powers of @xmath33 and find that the first order expansion agrees very well with the exact nlo result for @xmath124 . for @xmath127",
    ", further away from threshold , the first order expansion of the threshold resummed cross section lies very slightly below the exact nlo result for central rapidities .",
    "this is due to the fact that the contributions from the threshold region @xmath62 do not entirely dominate the cross section in this rapidity regime . as expected from our results in figs .",
    "[ fig : compass_int ] and [ fig : compass_int_k ] , at fixed rapidity the threshold resummation effects become more important as @xmath48 increases , resulting in a fairly large enhancement of the resummed cross section at @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless significant contributions from threshold resummation are still present in the cross section also for relatively modest values of @xmath48 .",
    "it is also interesting to examine to what extent resummation affects the _ shape _ of the rapidity dependent cross section .",
    "figure  [ fig : rap_03_ratio ] shows the ratios @xmath128 as functions of the pair rapidity , at @xmath115 and @xmath127 .",
    "one can see that @xmath129 becomes very large towards the boundaries of the @xmath13 interval .",
    "the resummed cross section shows a particularly sizable enhancement above the nlo one at high rapidities .",
    "this enhancement is due to the fact that at fixed @xmath48 the limit @xmath130 corresponds to the limit @xmath62 at parton level . in this",
    "limit threshold logarithms become large regardless of the value of @xmath48 .",
    "large @xmath48 and/or high rapidities in the fixed - target regime probe high momentum fractions @xmath1 in the parton distribution functions .",
    "including threshold resummation in the analysis of parton distribution functions may hence have significant effects on their extracted high-@xmath1 behavior .",
    "this was examined recently in the context of the drell - yan process @xcite and deep - inelastic lepton scattering  @xcite .",
    "the crucial quality test for any higher order calculation is the extent to which it reduces the scale ambiguity inherent to any perturbative qcd calculation .",
    "we examine the scale dependences of the rapidity - integrated and the rapidity - differential cross sections in figs .",
    "[ fig : scales ] and [ fig : scales_rap ] , respectively .",
    "again we show the lo , nlo and nll - resummed results at @xmath115 , now varying the renormalization and factorization scales between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : scales ] we have for better visibility multiplied the lo cross section by @xmath133 and the resummed one by @xmath134 .",
    "evidently for the integrated cross section the scale dependence is decreased by resummation over the whole range of invariant mass @xmath12 , whereas going from lo to nlo reduces the scale dependence only marginally .",
    "figure  [ fig : scales_rap ] shows the scale dependence of the rapidity distributions at @xmath124 .",
    "here we only show the nll - resummed cross section and the nlo one .",
    "as one can see , the scale dependence is again significantly improved by resummation .",
    "this applies to all values of rapidity ; in fact the scale dependence almost vanishes at high @xmath13 after resummation .",
    "we have presented a phenomenological study of the drell - yan cross section for pion scattering off a proton target at compass . in the calculation of the cross section we have resummed threshold corrections to next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the expansion of the resummed cross section to @xmath135 agrees very well with the exact fixed - order calculation .",
    "this agreement demonstrates that the large threshold logarithms indeed dominate the drell - yan cross section and need to be taken into account to all orders .",
    "resumming those logarithms leads to a significant enhancement above fixed - order calculations , even for moderate values of the invariant mass @xmath12 of the lepton pair .",
    "we have also considered the rapidity dependence of the cross section .",
    "we find that even in cases where there is only a modest enhancement of the rapidity - integrated cross section by resummation , the shape of the rapidity-_differential _ cross section is affected very strongly by resummation at sufficiently large forward or backward rapidities . finally , we have shown that the scale dependence of the perturbative cross section is substantially reduced when threshold resummed contributions are included .",
    "our results overall demonstrate that threshold resummation effects will be important in the analysis of future compass data .",
    "while we have only addressed the spin - averaged drell - yan cross section in this paper , we stress that threshold resummation effects are expected to be equally relevant also for corresponding spin - dependent cross sections , even though they may have a tendency to cancel in spin asymmetries .",
    "we also note that in the light of our study cross sections and spin asymmetries at measured transverse momentum @xmath136 of the lepton pair , which will be a particular focus of the investigations at compass , will require additional theoretical consideration .",
