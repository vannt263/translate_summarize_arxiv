    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions are extremely suppressed due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of such fcnc processes may provide indirect evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the fcnc process has been searched for in the flavor physics such as @xmath6  @xcite and in the vector boson mediated process of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is possible that the new scalar could be connected to the new physics .",
    "searching for higgs - related fcnc processes is an important way to study the higgs properties . in this context",
    ", the fcnc process of @xmath8 becomes more interesting since the higgs boson , with a measured mass @xmath9 gev  @xcite , is lighter than the top quark .",
    "the large mass of the @xmath10 and @xmath11-quark could significantly enhance the @xmath8 decay probability , leading to a measurable rate  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath8 , @xmath12 , is predicted to be of the order of @xmath13  @xcite in the sm .",
    "this fcnc decay is enhanced in various sm extentions .",
    "for example , the two higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) predict that @xmath14 ranges @xmath15 up to @xmath16  @xcite , which is already close to the measured upper limits , 0.56%  @xcite and 0.46%  @xcite from the cms and atlas experiments respectively .",
    "compared to the decay modes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the higgs mass can not be easily reconstructed in the decay mode @xmath19 , because of the presence of the neutrinos .",
    "usually , the collinear approximation  @xcite or the missing mass calculator ( mmc ) technique  @xcite is used . in this paper , we propose a method to improve the sensitivity for the decay mode @xmath19 based on the kinematic properties of the production @xmath20 with @xmath21 at the lhc .",
    "this result can be combined with the existing search modes for the best sensitivity .",
    "it can confirm the signal as a fcnc type in the case of discovery as the @xmath17 does , and it does not suffer from the @xmath22-jet combinatorics as in the @xmath18 channel .",

    ". if either of the @xmath32 s is mis - matched , both the higgs mass and the top mass will not be reconstructed correctly , which makes the signal events background - like .    to improve the rate of @xmath11-jet matching with the @xmath11-parton , the helicity angle of the higgs , @xmath77 , is studied . for the decay @xmath61 , @xmath77",

    "[ fig : mass_postfit ] , each event entry is weighted by @xmath87 , which is determined by the signal ( @xmath88 ) and background ( @xmath89 ) predictions for each bdt bin .",
    "to conclude , based on a fit taking into account the higgs mass constraint and the @xmath32 decay kinematics , both the higgs mass and the top mass in the decay @xmath90 can be reconstructed with good resolutions .",
    "together with other discriminating variables , a bdt - based analysis shows that @xmath14 can be probed down to 0.25% with a data set of 100  fb@xmath4 in lhc run-2 .",
    "thus , the coupling constant @xmath91 is obtained according to the formula @xmath92 in ref .",
    "it is worth noting that the results in this analysis are based on the expected atlas performance in the run-1 period , especially for the @xmath22-tagging , which is expected to improve in run-2 due to the atlas inner detector upgrade @xcite .",
    "the trigger acceptance is not studied in this analysis , whose impact can be somehow compensated by the fact that a large fraction of run-2 data is expected to be taken at 14 tev collision energy . the result can be combined with @xmath93 analyses in which the masses of higgs and top are also reconstructed for discovery , and can be further combined with the tri - lepton searches where these masses are not reconstructed for exclusions .",
