    "insulator to metal / superconductor transitions , onset of conductivity and nature of transport have been explored using quench condensed thin films .",
    "microstructure and morphology govern these phenomena , which depend on how the films are grown . @xcite the processes controlling the onset of conduction in such films remain controversial .",
    "the prime cause for this is the lack of direct structural information .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that at the onset of conductivity , film is composed of islands .",
    "the opposing school of thought questions this since thermally activated mechanisms for island growth freeze out at cryogenic temperatures , with adatoms sticking wherever they land.@xcite    of two recent experiments to probe the onset of conductivity , @xcite one study probes the ir conductivity , where @xmath2 is found to increase with @xmath3 but in disagreement with predictions of weak localization",
    ". the data are consistent with a percolation type model .",
    "in contrast the other experiment probes the structure with an stm and finds that even at 75% coverage , the films are not conducting . this latter experiment is inconsistent with a percolation model .",
    "several materials ( eg . bi , al ) exhibit an increase in the transition temperature when quench condensed as disordered thin films .",
    "two different mechanisms have been proposed for this , with experiments yielding ambiguous results .",
    "one mechanism attributes the enhancement to softening of the phonon modes , caused by the increased surface to volume ratio for nanoparticles.@xcite the opposing interpretation is an enhancement of the @xmath1 by a screening mechanism which results from proximity to a dielectric.@xcite our experiments indicate that such an effect plays an important role , as shown in fig .",
    "1.@xcite such results have been reported earlier.@xcite    experimental evidence from both real space stm and reciprocal space rheed studies indicates the presence of clusters.@xcite neither technique has been fully exploited to resolve the controversy over the crystalline / amorphous nature of these .",
    "small size implies discreteness of the energy levels , whose spacing may be large compared to thermal energy kt , making the assumption of metallic behavior incorrect.@xcite    the nature of disorder would be different in films with ge underlayers , since ge offers dangling bonds .",
    "since the resistances of films with underlayers are higher , we believe that this is evidence of an interplay between screening and localization . such an effect is not necessarily small , being of the order of typical logarithmic correction , @xmath4 .",
    "thus the underlayers play a twofold role .",
    "observations of a metallic monolayer increasing the transition temperature are relevant here.@xcite further , experimental observations that slight thickness variations change a film from an insulator to a superconductor , indicate a role for percolation .",
    "the two contradictory experiments discussed above may then be reconciled as under.@xcite    onset of superconductivity may then be regarded as a consequence of varying the percentage coverage of josephson like bonds .",
    "percolation threshold corresponds to the onset of macroscopic phase coherence with 50% of the junctions among superconducting clusters being phase coherent .",
    "due to quantum size effects not all clusters will be superconducting . hence",
    ", although 75% of the substrate may be covered by material as evidenced by stm observations , there may be no conductivity across the film , implying that a critical number of superconducting clusters ( that yield 50% phase coherent junctions ) are a must for establishment of global phase coherence .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this will be published elsewhere .",

    "the ge was deposited on amorphous quartz at room temperature and the bi deposited on both at 1.5 k. the numbers on the right hand side indicates nominal thickness in @xmath5 . ]",
