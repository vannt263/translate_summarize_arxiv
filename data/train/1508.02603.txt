    "neutron stars are thought to consist of the outer crust , inner crust and the core ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outer crust extends to densities @xmath0 , where @xmath1 g  @xmath2 is the neutron drip density .",
    "it mostly contains strongly degenerate electrons and atomic nuclei ( remnants of atoms fully ionized by the huge electron pressure ) . when the density increases , the nuclei become more neutron rich .    the inner crust ( where @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the density at the crust - core interface and @xmath5 g  @xmath2 is the density of saturated nuclear matter ) consists of ultrarelativistic highly degenerate electrons , very neutron rich nuclei and free degenerate neutrons ( dripped off the nuclei ) . with increasing density in the inner crust ,",
    "the fraction of free neutrons ( among bound and free nucleons ) grows up , so that free neutrons give larger contribution to the pressure , while atomic nuclei become loosely bound as if dissolving in the neutron sea . finally , the nuclei disappear at @xmath6 which signals the transition to the liquid core of the star .",
    "the crust as a whole is about 1 km thick and contains about one percent of the neutron star mass .",
    "the liquid core can extend to about @xmath7 .",
    "the outer core ( @xmath8 ) consists of strongly degenerate neutrons , with some admixture of protons , electrons and muons .",
    "the inner core ( @xmath9 ) may contain hyperons , pion or kaon condensates or free quarks or the mixture of these .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a possible layer of _ nuclear mantle _ at the bottom of the inner crust containing various _ exotic nuclear clusters _ called collectively _ nuclear pasta_.",
    "it was predicted by @xcite who investigated properties of matter in core - collapsing supernovae .",
    "it has been studied by many authors as summarized in a discussion below ( also see @xcite for references to early publications ) .",
    "a neutron star mantle can exist or not , depending on specific properties of nuclear interactions at subnuclear densities .",
    "if exist , it forms the layer between the ordinary crust and the core , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 g  @xmath2 is the outer boundary of this layer .",
    "the mantle is often viewed as a part of the inner crust .",
    "although the mantle occurs in a narrow density interval , its mass can be comparable to the mass of the entire crust .",
    "as remarked above , the nuclei are loosely bound there . in this case",
    "nuclear binding becomes as low as coulomb energies of the nuclei .",
    "nuclear pasta forms when coulomb energy is sufficiently strong to rearrange nearly spherical atomic nuclei into exotic nuclear clusters .",
    "the studies of nuclear pasta can be divided into two parts .",
    "first , one considers hot matter of subnuclear densities for core - collapsed supernovae and proto - neutron stars where beta equilibrium is absent .",
    "the second direction is to investigate colder pasta that can be available in neutron stars under the beta equilibrium condition .",
    "we are interested in the second possibility .",
    "very roughly , a transition from the first to the second case occurs at temperatures @xmath12 from about a few times of @xmath13  k to @xmath14  k.    there are two major approaches to study nuclear pasta .",
    "\\(i ) first , one considers one- , two- or three dimensional nuclear clusters using different versions of the compressible liquid drop model ( e.g. , @xcite ) or thomas - fermi theories ( e.g. , @xcite ) with various mean field interactions .",
    "the theory predicts four phases i  iv of nuclear pasta in a neutron star mantle .",
    "the first phase i , which appears with increasing density at @xmath15 , is the phase of rods ( `` spaghetti '' ) . nuclear structures become rod - like there , immersed in a liquid of free neutrons .",
    "one studies neutron and proton density profiles across these rods assuming that their length is large ( infinite ) .",
    "the phase of rods is followed by phase ii of slabs ( `` lasagna '' phase ) .",
    "the slabs are filled by nuclear matter and immersed in neutron liquid .",
    "one calculates nuclear structure across the slabs while the slabs themselves are assumed large ( infinite ) .",
    "the phase of slabs is followed by phase iii of rod - like bubbles ( `` anti - sphagetti '' ) , where free neutrons fill infinitely long bubbles aligned along certain axis , and the nuclear structures occupy all other space .",
    "the final phase iv consists of nuclear matter with spherical bubbles of neutron ( and possibly proton ) liquid ( `` swiss cheese '' ) .",
    "some calculations predict all four exotic phases , while others predict fewer phases or no exotic phases at all .",
    "real rods or slabs are thought to be of finite size and occupy some domains .",
    "the sizes of nuclear clusters and domains as well as orientations of nuclear clusters in different domains are uncertain .",
    "\\(ii ) second , one simulates the composition and dynamics of ensembles of nuclear clusters with various versions of quantum molecular dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) or classical molecular dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such simulations predict a variety of possibilities , first of all nuclear clusters of one type , e.g. rods , but of finite lengths and different sizes .",
    "they predict also mixtures of different clusters ( e.g. , rods and slabs ) .",
    "recently , more exotic structures have been obtained , such as slabs with a lattice of bubbles ( `` nuclear waffles , '' @xcite ) , gyroids @xcite , intertwined lasagna and other structures which do not resemble usual pasta @xcite , as well as long lived topological defects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at high temperatures @xmath16 k",
    "nuclear pasta is mostly in liquid state but at low temperatures ( in neutron stars ) it freezes into ordered or disordered clusters .",
    "the existence of nuclear pasta does not affect significantly the equation of state of the matter and neutron star models .",
    "however it can strongly influence neutrino emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) and transport properties of the neutron star mantle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will focus on electron transport which is thought to be dominant there . to simplify the problem",
    "we assume the existence of nuclear pasta domains with nuclear clusters of one type in each domain .",
    "we include the effects of strong magnetic fields which can be very important .",
    "we start with the electron transport properties in one domain assuming that electron mean free paths are larger than spacing between nuclear clusters but smaller than domain size and neglecting boundary effects .",
    "for example , consider ensembles of rod - like or slab - like nuclear structures .",
    "the electrons are mainly scattered by proton charge distributions created by these structures .",
    "consider a strongly degenerate and ultra - relativistic electron gas which is slightly out of thermodynamic equilibrium due to the presence of weak gradients of temperature @xmath12 and electron chemical potential @xmath17 as well as due to a weak electric field @xmath18 .",
    "kinetic properties of the electrons are calculated from the boltzmann equation for the electron distribution function @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electron velocity , momentum and electric charge , respectively ; @xmath24 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath25 is the collision integral .",
    "the distribution function is normalized as @xmath26 @xmath27 being the electron number density . without any loss of generality it is sufficient to consider a stationary problem , with @xmath28 . because the electrons deviate from equilibrium only slightly ,",
    "we can set @xmath29 , where @xmath30^{-1 } \\label{e : fermi}\\ ] ] is the local equilibrium fermi distribution ( @xmath31 being the electron energy and @xmath32 the boltzmann constant ) , and @xmath33 is a small non - equilibrium correction .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. , @xcite ) that one can set @xmath34 on the left - hand side of ( [ e : boltzmann ] ) in all the terms except for the one containing the magnetic force ( because the latter term vanishes at @xmath34 )",
    ". then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the linearized collision integral .",
    "since @xmath37 depends on @xmath38 through @xmath39 and @xmath40 , equation ( [ e : boltzmann1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 where we have introduced the notations @xmath42 @xmath43 being the effective electric field . while calculating the electron kinetic coefficients we can treat @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath18 and @xmath43 as arbitrary constant small vectors .    at the next step",
    "we should specify the linearized collision integral @xmath36 . in order to study the main properties of kinetic coefficients one can often use the traditional simplified relaxation time approximation , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the relaxation time and",
    "@xmath48 is the effective collision frequency . in the simplest case",
    "when electrons scatter elastically by some heavy centers , one has @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number density of scatterers and @xmath51 is the transport cross section ; @xmath52 , @xmath47 and @xmath51 can depend on the electron energy @xmath31 .",
    "if one interests in a dipole - like deviation of the electron distribution function from the equilibrium one ( which is relevant for studying electric and thermal conductivities as well as thermopower ) , it is sufficient to set @xmath53 , where the vector @xmath54 ( to be determined ) can depend on the electron energy @xmath31 but not on orientation of its momentum @xmath22",
    ". then @xmath55 .",
    "the case of nuclear pasta is more complicated because we deal with anisotropic medium .",
    "as far as nuclear clusters are concerned , we assume that we have a symmetry plane @xmath56 ( perpendicular to nuclear rods or plates ) and a symmetry axis @xmath57 ( perpendicular to the plane ) . without any loss of generality we may assume that the magnetic field @xmath24 lies in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "a natural generalization of the relaxation time approximation ( [ e : tau - nu ] ) to this case is @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are generally different effective collision frequencies along the symmetry axis and in the symmetry plane , respectively ; @xmath62 ; @xmath63 , and @xmath54 , as before , can depend on @xmath31 but not on orientation of @xmath22 .",
    "the difference between @xmath60 and @xmath61 reflects the anisotropy of electron collision frequencies in non - spherical nuclear clusters .",
    "such an approximation is often used for studying electron transport in anisotropic solids ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the absence of anisotropy",
    ", one has @xmath64 and the problem reduces to a single traditional effective scattering frequency ( [ e : tau - nu ] ) in isotropic medium .",
    ".possible pasta phases in a neutron star mantle [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : pasta ]    as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , there could be four phases i  iv of nuclear pasta in a neutron star mantle ; they are listed in table [ tab : pasta ] in order of appearance with increasing density at @xmath15 .",
    "phase i consists of rods .",
    "form symmetry consideration one can expect that the most frequent electron momentum transfer occurs when electrons move across the symmetry axis ( across the rods ) , so that @xmath61 should be larger than @xmath60 .",
    "we will call @xmath61 the leading collision frequency and @xmath60 the weaker collision frequency ( in phase i ) .",
    "phase i is followed by phase ii of slabs ( table [ tab : pasta ] ) .",
    "now the leading collision frequency @xmath60 corresponds to electrons moving along the symmetry axis ; they can scatter effectively by slabs which are perpendicular to the axis .",
    "the weaker collision frequency is then @xmath61 .",
    "after slabs one has phase iii of rod - like bubbles , where the collision frequencies are expected to have the same ordering as in phase i , @xmath65 .    the final phase iv is that of spherical bubbles . in this case",
    "@xmath64 ( electron collisions are isotropic ) as in the case of ordinary spherical nuclei in the main body of the neutron star crust ( at @xmath66 ) .",
    "for example , according to model i of @xcite , @xmath67 g  @xmath2 .",
    "the transition to phase ii occurs at @xmath68 g  @xmath2 ; to phase iii at @xmath69 g  @xmath2 , and to phase iv at @xmath70 g  @xmath2 .",
    "finally , phase iv ends at @xmath71 g  @xmath2 . in a typical neutron star of mass @xmath72 and radius",
    "about 12 km the nuclear pasta layer can be about 100 m thick and have mass @xmath73 ; it is nearly as massive as the entire overlying ordinary crust of spherical nuclei .",
    "equation ( [ e : collision_integral ] ) reduces the linearized boltzmann equation ( [ e : boltzmann2 ] ) to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the electron gyrofrequency ( @xmath31 includes the electron rest - mass energy ) , and @xmath76 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath24 . in the matrix form",
    "@xmath77 the solution can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the matrix @xmath80 , which will be denoted as @xmath81 , is @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the angle between @xmath24 and the symmetry axis @xmath57 .",
    "this gives us the vector @xmath54 and @xmath29 .",
    "then we can calculate the densities of electric and thermal currents , @xmath86 formally , @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the following structure @xmath89 where hat means @xmath90 matrix ( tensor ) of anisotropic kinetic coefficients , @xmath91 is the electric conductivity tensor , while two other tensors , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , are auxiliary .",
    "the same tensor @xmath92 enters both expressions , for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , as a consequence of the onsager reciprocal relations .    for applications ,",
    "it is instructive to rewrite ( [ e : kin - coeff ] ) in the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the tensors of electric resistivity , thermal conductivity and thermopower , respectively .",
    "again , the same tensor @xmath97 enters the expressions for @xmath43 and @xmath88 owing to the onsager relations . the thermal conductivity and thermopower",
    "are given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "so far our consideration has been quite general , valid for the electron gas of any relativity and degeneracy .",
    "the analysis is considerably simplified for strongly degenerate electrons . in this case",
    "the main contribution to electron transport comes from the electrons with energies @xmath100 in the narrow thermal width of the fermi level .",
    "standard calculations yield @xmath101 where @xmath81 is given by ( [ e : matrixa ] ) , @xmath102 is defined in ( [ e : vector_u ] ) , @xmath103 is the effective electron mass at the fermi surface ( @xmath17 includes @xmath104 ) , while @xmath105 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 have to be taken at @xmath106 .",
    "note that @xmath91 and @xmath96 satisfy the wiedemann - franz law , @xmath107 which is natural for strongly degenerate electrons in the relaxation - time approximation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the tensors @xmath91 and @xmath96 have similar structure , determined by the matrix @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , either electric or thermal conduction is defined by _",
    "six _ different transport coefficients of _ three _ types :    1 .",
    "three diagonal terms ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) are generally different reflecting anisotropy of the transport along all three axes ; 2 .",
    "there are two basically different hall coefficients ( @xmath111 ; @xmath112 ) and two different hall parameters , @xmath113 associated with two collision frequencies , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; they describe gyrotropic character of electron transport in a magnetic field ; 3 .",
    "there are two equal coefficients @xmath114 for non - vanishing @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; 4 .",
    "one has @xmath117 , in agreement with onsager relations .    naturally , the electron transport in nuclear pasta is richer in physics than in ordinary neutron star matter .",
    "let us present also the resistivity tensor @xmath118 its structure is simpler than that of @xmath91 or @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath91 is found from equation ( [ e : sigma , kappa ] ) , one can calculate the thermopower tensor as @xmath119 such relations are standard @xcite for scalar thermopower of strongly degenerate electrons in the relaxation time approximation .",
    "evidently , they remain valid for tensor quantities . in order to use them",
    "one should express @xmath105 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 in @xmath91 as functions of @xmath31 and set @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , one should express @xmath27 through @xmath17 and differentiate over @xmath17 afterwards .",
    "the presented expressions are sufficient to estimate the electron transport properties in one domain of nuclear pasta .",
    "below we analyze the transport coefficients in limiting cases . since the structure of @xmath91 and @xmath96 is the same , we will mainly discuss @xmath91 meaning that one can immediately find @xmath96 using equation ( [ e : wf ] ) .",
    "in the limit of @xmath120 the transport coefficients are greatly simplified , @xmath121 here , the conductivity is characterized by the two different kinetic coefficients , along and across the symmetry axis , @xmath122 in phases i and iii of nuclear rods or rod - like bubbles one expects @xmath65 ( table [ tab : pasta ] ) .",
    "then the conductivity @xmath123 along the symmetry axis is much larger than the leading conductivity @xmath124 across this axis .",
    "if we view the leading transport as ` normal , ' then the transport in the perpendicular direction is abnormally fast . in phase ii of nuclear slabs",
    "one has @xmath125 .",
    "the normal leading transport along the symmetry axis is much slower than across it ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "finally , in phase iv of spherical bubbles @xmath127 , so that the transport is isotropic ( ` normal ' in all directions , as in ordinary neutron star crust ) .",
    "if @xmath128 , transport properties are generally complicated .",
    "the simplest case takes place if @xmath24 is directed along the symmetry axis .",
    "then @xmath129 the conductivity in the symmetry plane is gyrotropic ( governed by the magnetic field and the collision frequency @xmath61 ) , while the conductivity along the symmetry axis is unaffected by @xmath24 and determined by @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath24 lies in the symmetry plane , along the @xmath130 axis , then @xmath131 the conductivity along @xmath24 is again unaffected by the magnetic field ( being naturally determined by @xmath61 ) , while the conductivity in the @xmath132 plane ( across @xmath24 ) is gyrotropic and regulated by @xmath61 and @xmath60 .    if @xmath133 , the conductivity is the same as in a basically isotropic medium immersed in a magnetic field ; see section [ s : spherical - bubbles ] .",
    "if we increase @xmath134 from @xmath135 , the hall parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 grow up and the electron transport is affected by the magnetic field .",
    "the regime of sufficiently small ( smaller than 1 ) hall parameters corresponds to weakly magnetized electrons , whereas the regime of high ( higher than 1 ) hall parameters to strongly magnetized electrons .",
    "because @xmath136 and @xmath137 are not equal , there is also the regime of intermediate magnetization in which the electrons are already magnetized with respect to one hall parameter but are still not magnetized with respect to the other one .",
    "these three magnetization regimes have different effects on various conductivity components at different inclinations @xmath85 of @xmath24 to the symmetry axis .    as for the @xmath134-dependence of the conductivity ,",
    "all conductivity components are divided into non - hall ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 ones ) and hall ones ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ; we do not mention associated non - diagonal components like @xmath144 or @xmath145 ) .",
    "the non - hall components are even functions of @xmath146 while the hall components are odd functions . in the limit of weak electron magnetization",
    "the diagonal components stay nearly constant , while @xmath147 increases as @xmath148 .",
    "all non - vanishing hall components increase proportionally to @xmath134 .    in the limit of high electron magnetization ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 )",
    "we obtain @xmath151 with increasing @xmath134 in this regime the non - hall components either stay constant ( as @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath147 ) or decrease proportionally to @xmath154 , whereas the hall components decrease as @xmath155 .",
    "the decrease of the conductivity components at strong magnetization is evidently explained by frequent rotation of electrons around magnetic field lines , with many rotations between successive collisions .",
    "the structure of the electric resistivity tensor @xmath156 , equation ( [ e : hatr ] ) , is simpler than of the conductivity .",
    "the diagonal components @xmath157 and @xmath158 are totally independent of @xmath24 , being equal to corresponding inverse diagonal components ( [ e : b=0,sigmaap ] ) of the electric conductivity tensor at @xmath135 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . the leading resistivity ( @xmath161 or @xmath162 ) is higher than the resistivity in the opposite direction .",
    "the hall components @xmath163 and @xmath164 are directly proportional to @xmath146 . in the regime of weak magnetization the diagonal components are larger than the hall ones while in the the regime of strong magnetization the hall components are larger .",
    "actually , there is only one non - trivial hall component of @xmath156 instead of two formal hall components @xmath165 and @xmath166 in ( [ e : hatr ] ) . to prove this one can rotate coordinate axes in the @xmath144 plane in such a way for the @xmath57-axis to become parallel to @xmath24 .",
    "after this rotation the tensor would contain the only one hall component @xmath167 totally independent of electron collision frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath60 ( proving that the hall components do not produce any dissipation although produce an important effect of hall drift of the magnetic field ) .",
    "such a rotation trick does not work out for conductivity tensors  there are generally two non - trivial hall components of the conductivity .",
    "the simplicity of the electric resistivity tensor is also pronounced in the expression for the joule heat @xmath168 [ erg  s@xmath169  @xmath2 ] , @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the components of the electron current @xmath87 across and along the symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "this phase is the simplest one because the medium is basically isotropic , @xmath133 .",
    "the conductivity and resistivity tensors are especially simple in the coordinate system with the @xmath57-axis parallel to @xmath24 . for instance , the electric conductivity and resistivity tensors take the well known form @xmath174 where the subscripts @xmath175 and @xmath176 refer to conductivities and resistivities parallel and perpendicular to @xmath24 , respectively , while the subscript h labels the hall terms .",
    "the hall terms in @xmath91 and @xmath156 have naturally different signs .",
    "the expressions for these components are @xmath177 with @xmath178 , @xmath179 being the single hall parameter in the given case .",
    "therefore , @xmath180 are independent of @xmath24 , and @xmath181 . in the regime of weak magnetization , at @xmath182 , one has nearly constant @xmath183 but @xmath184 , while at @xmath185 one has @xmath186 and @xmath187 .          by way of illustration , in fig .",

    ", the averaging should take into account correlation properties of electron transport in different domains .",

    "let the weaker collision frequency be limited by electron - electron collisions ( whose contribution is also plotted in fig 3 ) .",

    "s : formalism ] we have studied the electron transport in one domain and have found it rather complicated , with six generally different components of conductivity tensors .    in section [ s : avdomains ] we have considered electron transport in matter containing freely oriented domains of one type .",
    "the tensors of kinetic coefficients ( [ e : avsigma ] ) , ( [ e : sigma123a ] ) , and ( [ e : resist ] ) averaged over orientations of the domains are calculated analytically and have much simpler structure than their non - averaged counterparts .",
    "each tensor contains only three different components , along and across @xmath24 , as well as the hall component .",
    "these components show sufficiently simple dependence on @xmath24 . nevertheless , this dependence is less trivial than in ordinary basically isotropic media with @xmath64 .",

    "the collision frequencies and transport properties in phase of nuclear bubbles can be calculated rather reliably ; they appear similar to those in traditional phase of spherical nuclei .",
    "however , the collision frequencies for non - spherical nuclear clusters are uncertain and require further attention .",
    "much work should be done to clarify transport properties of nuclear pasta .",
    "the major problem is to reliably calculate effective collision frequencies @xmath60 and @xmath61 for non - spherical nuclear clusters i  iii ( as outlined in section [ s : non - spheric ] ) .",
    "the problem requires accurate studies of proton charge fluctuations in these structures .",
    "we have treated nuclear clusters in one domain as ordered and having the same shapes .",
    "if the ordering is not exact and the parameters ( e.g. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) strongly vary , an additional averaging over disorder and parameter distributions has to be performed .",
    "we have assumed that orientations of domains are free . if not , more complicated averaging over orientations is needed .",
    "we have neglected quantum oscillations of electron kinetic coefficients in very strong magnetic fields due to population of new electron landau levels with increasing density ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if the electrons occupy many landau levels , these oscillations are not too strong and our results should reproduce oscillation - averaged kinetic properties .",
    "in addition , since nuclear clusters are loosely bound , very strong magnetic fields may influence proton charge fluctuations and affect transport properties in this way .",
    "all these problems are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another , more serious problem would be to account for possible impurities and defects in nuclear pasta .",
    "it seems that these effects can greatly enhance or suppress electron transport .",
    "finally , let us stress , that there are other heat and charge transport mechanisms in nuclear pasta which should be taken into account along with the mechanisms studied above .",
    "for instance , one should bear in mind thermal conductivity due to electron - electron collisions ( e.g. @xcite ) and due to superfluid phonons @xcite associated with the presence of free superfluid neutrons .",
    "the results of the present studies can be useful for modeling of thermal relaxation between crust and core in young neutron stars and also in accreting neutron stars in x - ray transients with the crust overheated during accretion episodes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the results can be used to study evolution of magnetic fields in neutron stars and related phenomena ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
