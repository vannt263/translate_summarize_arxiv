    "in the last decades , quantum optics experiments based on intensity light measurements have been realized mainly with intense ( macroscopic ) fields or at single - photon level , while photon counting with few - photon light ( up to 100 photons ) is a rather unexplored measurement regime . in the first two regimes ( i.e. the macroscopic one and the single - photon level ) , several quantum optical applications have been derived , such as the ones related to quantum mechanics foundations investigation @xcite quantum communication @xcite , computation @xcite and metrology @xcite .",
    "this partially derives from the fact that the output of detectors operating in this regime are not considered trustworthy , also because this region has not yet been investigated from the metrological point of view in order to provide well established characterization techniques .",
    "in this paper we review the klyshko calibration method , based on the parametric down conversion ( pdc ) phenomenon , for single - photon detectors , as well as few extensions to photon - number - resolving detectors ( pnrd ) realized in our laboratories ; further works can be found in @xcite . on the other hand , applications of pdc light to analog regimes @xcite",
    "are beyond the purpose of this review .    in the following",
    ", the term  single - photon detector \" refers to detectors producing just a  click \" irrespective of the number of photons impinging on it , e.g. single - photon avalanche diodes ( spads ) operating in geiger mode . on the contrary , typical detectors able to observe more than one photon are , e.g. , high gain photomultiplier tubes @xcite , hybrid photodetectors @xcite , ccds and electron multiplying ccds ( emccds ) @xcite , silicon photomultipliers , the superconducting transition edge sensors ( tess ) @xcite , time - multiplexed single - photon detectors @xcite and single - photon detectors in tree configurations @xcite .",
    "no direct comparison upon common set of figures of merit was performed so far on these group of pnrds , also because at first it is necessary to establish a set of standardized definitions , connected with such figures of merit , as well as the corresponding characterization protocols . in the first part of this article",
    "we will focus on the detection quantum efficiency , @xmath0 ( where dut stands for device under test ) , defined as the overall probability of observing the presence of a single photon impinging on the dut . in the following",
    "we will see how to extend the klyshko s absolute measurement technique ( named klyshko two - photon technique , ktpt ) based on correlated photons obtained from pdc , originally developed for single - photon detectors @xcite , to pnrds . in order to characterize the detection behavior of pnrds , together with the estimation of @xmath0 it is fundamental to provide a theoretical model for their measurement process .",
    "usually in quantum optics it is assumed that the detection model of a non - ideal detector ( i.e. detector with @xmath1 ) can be described as an ideal detector with unity efficiency placed after a beam splitter of transmissivity @xmath0 . in practice , this implies that the detection process in the presence of more than one photon is described by the bernoulli distribution .",
    "this detection model is absolutely reasonable for typical  analog \" detectors for  macroscopic \" light . on the contrary ,",
    "detection models for pnrds may significantly differ from the bernoulli one , as in the case of time - multiplexed single - photon detectors , trees of single photon detectors , or silicon photomultipliers .    in the following two pnrds",
    "will be considered : the tes @xcite and a tree of two single photon detectors .",
    "since tes is essentially a superconductive microcalorimeter with a linear response , it is absolutely reasonable to expect for it a bernoulli detection model . in the case of the tree of spad detectors ,",
    "the model is no longer linear and will be analysed in the last section .    in section 2 we will present the ktpt applied to an avalanche photo diode ( apd ) based single photon counting module , showing the detection efficiency obtained with this absolute calibration technique .",
    "finally , in section 3 we will discuss the extension of the ktpt from the calibration of single - photon detectors to pnrds . in particular , we will discuss a ktpt - based calibration method , that exploits the whole information from the output of the pnrd , without referring to some specific detection model .",
    "as already pointed out , pnrd characterization exploiting the above mentioned calibration techniques may not provide complete information regarding the detector behavior . on the contrary , at least in one case ,",
    "the determination of the quantum efficiency is strongly dependent on the assumption of a specific detection model . for this reason , we consider also few calibration techniques providing the full characterization of the detection process of pnrds . here",
    ", the detection process is considered as a quantum operation , thus the technique consists in realizing the tomography of the quantum operation .",
    "the method using pdc to calibrate detectors is a well - established technique @xcite .",
    "it has the peculiarity of being intrinsically absolute , as it does not rely on any externally calibrated radiometric standards @xcite .",
    "the pdc phenomenon was predicted in 1961 by louisell et al .",
    "@xcite , and the very first experiment to observe coincidences between downconverted photons in 1970 @xcite also included the first detector calibration using a pdc source .",
    "the method was not widely disseminated , however , and 7 years later klyshko @xcite independently proposed that pdc could be used to measure detection efficiency . in the early 1980 s , few groups @xcite pushed the technique from demonstrational experiments to more accurate calibrations . as a consequence",
    "the ktpt has been added to the toolbox of primary radiometric techniques for detectors calibration @xcite , even if it has been deeply studied only in the case of single - photon detectors @xcite .",
    "the pdc process is used to create the correlated pair of photons allowing the absolute quantum efficiency measurement @xcite .",
    "the detection of one of the photons pairs announces the presence of its mate , and any missed detection ( in absence of losses ) of the announced photon is due to the non - ideal quantum efficiency of the dut .     and detector b with efficiency",
    "@xmath2 collect the photons of correlated arms .",
    "counters and coincidence electronics allow to obtain the number of signal counts @xmath3 , the number of idler counts @xmath4 and the number of photons arriving in coincidence to both detectors @xmath5.,width=302 ]    the calibration scheme is depicted in fig [ schemasetup ] . two correlated channels of pdc emission ( dubbed signal and idler ) , are selected and directed to photo counters a and b respectively . in the ideal situation ( no losses ) , the detection of one photon of the pair guarantees with certainty the presence of the second photon along the correlated direction .",
    "if @xmath6 is the total number of pairs emitted by the crystal in a given time interval , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the average count rates recorded by detectors a and b during the same time interval , and @xmath5 is the coincidences count rate , we have the relations    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the detection efficiencies of photodetectors a and b at specific wavelength @xmath10 and @xmath11 . due to the statistical independence of the detectors ,",
    "the number of coincidences is    @xmath12    then , the detection efficiency can be found as    @xmath13    anyway , in practice it is very difficult to guarantee that both detectors see only correlated photons , thus we have to associate each arm with a particular purpose : one detector is the device under test ( dut ) , while the other acts as a trigger , to indicate when a detection is expected in the dut .",
    "we underline that , since the determination of @xmath0 is independent of the trigger efficiency , losses in the trigger channel do not affect the calibration technique      in this section we analyze some details of the experimental realization of ktpt .",
    "usually , the coincidence and counting electronics associated to these calibration experiments is like the one reported in fig .",
    "[ electronica ] .",
    "the output signal from the trigger detector is sent to the start input of the tac , and the dut output is delayed ( 6.5 ns ) and sent to the stop input of the tac . the tac output is sent simultaneously to a multichannel analyzer ( mca ) and to a single - channel analyzer ( sca ) . the mca records histograms of inter - arrival times of the dut and trigger events .",
    "the sca output is addressed to a counter in order to measure coincidence counts .",
    "correlated photon pairs are seen in the histogram as a peak on top of a flat background resulting from uncorrelated output pulses from the two detectors .",
    "true coincidences are found by counting the events within a fixed time window around this peak and subtracting the flat background level within the same time window ( referred to as accidental coincidences ) .          to account for the presence of unwanted counts , eq .",
    "[ eficiencias ] has to be modified .",
    "in addition to the correlated photons , each detector suffers from background counts , due to unwanted external light ( e.g. stray light or unheralded pdc light ) , and spurious counts due to thermal fluctuation inside the detector or trapped carriers ( dark counts and afterpulses ) .",
    "thus , spurious coincidence counts are superimposed on the correlated pairs , leading to the above mentioned background counts and accidental coincidences . to correct for the unwanted detected light ,",
    "the measured quantum efficiency , @xmath14 , is estimated from @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the average coincidence counts measured by tac / sca , @xmath17 the average valid start counts , @xmath18 the average background counts on the valid start and @xmath19 are the accidental coincidence counts .",
    "concerning this last correction one has to detail a little more .",
    "the tac valid start output provides only the true trigger counts that are considered for conversion and give contribution to coincidences . thus the tac dead time effect can be neglected thanks to the valid start output .",
    "we should also note that the number of valid start counts able to produce an accidental coincidence drastically changes if the peak of coincidences is in the tac windows or not .",
    "because the accidental counts are evaluated by adding a delay to the dut output , in order to move the peak out of the measurement window , a correction for @xmath19 should be added accounting to this valid start mismatch .",
    "a reasonable first order correction is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the average value of the valid start counts when the coincidence peak is in the tac window and @xmath22 is the valid start average when the coincidence peak is not in the tac windows .",
    "then , the measured quantum efficiency becomes    @xmath23    if we take into account a correction due to optical losses , we obtain the quantum efficiency of just the detector under calibration    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the total transmittance of the dut arm .",
    "a careful estimation of @xmath25 is crucial in order to adequately evaluate the quantum efficiency of the device under calibration .",
    "this kind of protocol has been experimentally implemented many times ( e.g. ref,@xcite ) .    according to ref.s [ @xcite ] , the statistical uncertainty associated with this two - photon measurement technique",
    "is deduced by applying the uncertainty propagation law @xcite to the model of eq .",

    "sensitivity coefficients @xmath29 are deduced by standard uncertainty propagation rules and the correlation coefficients @xmath30 are evaluated from repeated experimental data as @xmath31 .",
    "recently , a new implementation of the ktpt protocol has been carried out , obtaining a value of @xmath0 with a relative uncertainty of @xmath32 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , paving the way to applications in photometry and metrology @xcite .",
    "the extension of the ktpt to pnrds system is quite straightforward @xcite .    as in the classic ktpt",
    ", it is necessary to perform two separate measurements in the presence and in the absence of the heralded photon . for each measurement , a data histogram analogous to the one reported in fig .",
    "[ peaks ] is obtained , from which it is possible to estimate the probabilities of observing @xmath33 photons per heralding count in the presence of a heralded photon ( @xmath34 ) and in the absence of the heralded photon ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the probability of observing 0 photons in the presence of the heralded photons is simply the product of the probability of non - detection of the heralded photons multiplied by the probability of having 0 accidental counts :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the quantum efficiency of the dut channel , including the optical losses , i.e. @xmath38 .    analogously , the probability of observing @xmath33 counts in presence of a heralded photon can be written as @xmath39    from these equations , we can derive @xmath40 ways to evaluate the quantum efficiency of our pnrd : from eq.([p0 ] ) the efficiency can be estimated as @xmath41 while from eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) @xmath42    it is noteworthy to observe that the set of hypotheses in the context of this calibration technique is exactly the same as the ones of the proper ktpt , and the same measurements are necessary . in this case , for each value of @xmath33 ( i.e. for each peak of fig . [ peaks ] ) we obtain an estimation for @xmath37 , allowing also a test of consistency for the estimation model . furthermore , as the number of heralding counts appears both at the numerator and at the denominator of eq.s ( [ p02 ] ) and ( [ pi2 ] ) , the correction for false heralding counts coming from stray - light , dark counts and afterpulses can be neglected .",

    "@xcite is shown a recent implementation of the proposed calibration technique applied to a tes .",
    "for this purpose , a certain number of the detector properties should be considered , e.g. :    _ tes jitter _ : the poor temporal resolution of tess ( time jitter larger than 100 ns ) does not allow the use of small coincidence temporal windows .",
    "a reasonable solution is the exploitation of a heralded single photon source and the measurement of the coincidences in presence and in absence of heralding signal .",
    "the second measurement allows a trustworthy estimation of the accidental coincidences , since tess are not affected by afterpulsing .",

    "_ optical losses _ : in the ktpt a careful estimation of the optical losses on the arm of the detector under test is crucial . in the specific case of the tes , where the detector input is the pit of the optical fiber , optical losses should account also for the coupling efficiency in the optical fiber .",

    "the two beams are addressed respectively to the dut and the tomographer .",
    "the dut is a detector tree composed by a 50:50 fiber beam splitter with the outputs connected to two si - spads , thus it can give 3 different outcomes : 0 , 1 and 2-or - more detected photons per pulse .",
    "event 0 occurs if neither spad clicks , event 1 is registered if either spad clicks ( but not both ) and event 2 corresponds to both spads clicking at once .",
    "the two si - spads outputs of the dut , together with the one of the tomographer ( another si - spad ) and a laser trigger pulse , are sent to a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) based data collection and processing system .",
    "the fpga is programmed to take data only if the three detectors are available , discarding the events affected by the dead time of the three si - spads .",
    "the relative frequencies @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , corresponding to the number of 0- , 1- and 2-click events normalized to their sum , need to be determined to allow the reconstruction of the dut s povm .",
    "in addition , for each efficiency @xmath140 the relative frequencies of conditional events are determined , paired with tomographer s clicks ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 @xmath143 ) and no - clicks ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) . as mentioned before , the reconstruction of the photon number distribution of the bipartite state is the first step in obtaining the povm elements : the @xmath147 elements are extracted exploiting the no - click frequencies of the tomographer , @xmath148     ( black dots ) given by a poisson distribution with @xmath149 average photons per pulse .",
    "( b ) comparison between the reconstructed distribution ( red bars ) , with a poisson distribution ( light blue bars ) with the photon number determined by the fit in ( a ) .",
    "the uncertainties represent the @xmath150 variations in the reconstructions performed on 30 different data sets .",
    "since in this experiment the probability of observing 5 or more photons is negligible ( less than 4 @xmath151 ) , data are shown only up to @xmath152 photons.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   ( black dots ) given by a poisson distribution with @xmath149 average photons per pulse .",

    "[ stato ] shows that , as expected , the experimentally reconstructed photon distribution is in excellent agreement with the poisson distribution , with a fidelity larger than @xmath153 .    by substituting the @xmath134 s together with the set of calibrated efficiencies @xmath154 into eq .",
    "( [ probs ] ) , the quantities @xmath77 are reconstructed using a regularized least square method @xcite to minimize the deviation between the measured and theoretical values of the probabilities .    in particular , for each @xmath155 and for each output @xmath74 of the dut , the deviation between the observed @xmath156 and theoretical probabilities @xmath157 is minimized , as well as the deviation between @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "+    the reconstructed @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 are presented in fig .",
    "excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results are supported by the high fidelities ( above 99.9 % ) for values @xmath163 , while for @xmath164 the quality of the povm reconstruction rapidly decreases .    in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] are reported the fidelities of the reconstructed povm elements shown in fig .",
    "[ povm ] : the high values obtained confirm that the extracted povm provides a reliable quantum description of the detection process .    .",
    "the reliability of the reconstruction is confirmed by the fact that the fidelities are all above @xmath165 . ]",
    "in this review , we have presented some recent progresses achieved in the inrim quantum optics labs about calibration of single or few photon detectors .",
    "we hope that the illustrated results can give the reader an idea about the problems , the state of the art and the perspectives of this kind of studies , fostering further efforts in these directions .",
    "we also stress that , in our opinion , such a topic is of crucial relevance for the present and future developments in photonic quantum technologies and related research fields ( e.g. quantum information and cryptography @xcite ) .",
