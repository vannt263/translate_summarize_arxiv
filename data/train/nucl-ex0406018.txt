    "low - energy antiproton physics is currently being done at the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) of cern , geneva . due to the low intensity ( @xmath0 @xmath1/s ) and",
    "the availability of only pulsed extraction , the physics program is limited to the spectroscopy of antiprotonic atoms and antihydrogen formed in charged particle traps or by stopping antiprotons in low - density gas targets .",
    "furthermore , the output energy of the ad ( 5 mev kinetic energy ) is still significantly higher than the @xmath2 kev energy best suited for these experiments .    at the future accelerator facility for beams of ions and antiprotons at darmstadt",
    "it will become possible to create a next - generation low - energy antiproton facility to overcome these limitations by providing cooled beams at higher intensities and a factor 100 lower energy .",
    "in addition the new facility should have the possibility of slow ( _ i .",
    "e. _ continuous ) extraction , which will allow nuclear / particle physics type experiments requiring coincidence measurements to be performed .",
    "recently , a letter of intent has been submitted to gsi , darmstadt , for a facility called flair ( facility for low - energy antiproton and ion research ) @xcite that is described in the following .",
    "it consists of two storage rings , a magnetic ( lsr ) and an electrostatic ( usr ) one , and a universal trap facility ( hitrap ) , cf .",
    "[ fig : facility ] .",
    "these components of the facility can provide stored as well as fast and slow extracted cooled beams at energies between 30 mev and 300 kev ( lsr ) , between 300 kev and 20 kev ( usr ) , and cooled particles at rest or at ultra - low ( ev  kev ) energies ( hitrap ) .",
    "this will allow a large variety of new experiments to be performed , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : physics ] . among the unique experiments only possible at such a facility are nuclear physics studies using antiprotons as a hadronic probe to investigate the structure of nuclei , including radioactive isotopes produced at the future facility , and many atomic - collision type experiments with internal targets in both storage rings with effective intensities as large as 10@xmath3 @xmath1/s .",
    "an important synergetic aspect is that the whole structure will also be used to study highly charged ions , including storing , cooling ( lsr , usr ) and trapping them in penning traps like hitrap and investigating them in a dedicated area for heavy ions .",
    "the key features of the proposed facility at darmstadt ( cf . fig .  [ fig : facility ] ) are :    * * high - brightness , high - intensity , low - energy antiproton beams . * * * high antiproton intensity due to * accumulation*. * * cooled @xmath1  beams down to * 300 kev * using lsr . * * electrostatic storage ring ( usr ) for atomic collision experiments and deceleration and cooling to * 20 kev*. * * hitrap for efficient deceleration of @xmath1s from 4 mev to * rest * and extraction of @xmath1s from a cooler trap at * kev * energies . * both * slow and fast * extraction from lsr and usr at energies between 30 mev and 20 kev .    the antiproton production method at the future facility @xcite ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : flairandfuturefacility ] ) is similar to the scheme used for lear at cern .",
    "10@xmath4 antiprotons will be produced every 5 seconds , will be collected in the cr storage ring , accumulated in the resr and transferred to the nesr for further cooling and deceleration to 30 mev . from the nesr",
    "the antiprotons will be transferred to the flair facility for further deceleration in the lsr storage ring , in the electrostatic storage ring usr , and in the hitrap facility .",
    "antiproton rates of @xmath5/s extracted both fast and slow at energies down to 20 kev will be available .",
    "the @xmath1   can be either directly stopped in low - density gas targets using thin windows , or trapped with high efficiency in charged particle traps .",
    "the same rate of antiprotons can be obtained at rest in hitrap or extracted at ultra - low ( ev  kev ) energies .",
    "this scheme gives about a factor 100 more antiprotons per unit time stopped in gas targets or trapped in ion traps as compared to the present ad at cern where no dedicated accumulation and multi - stage deceleration rings are utilized .",
    "the availability of such beams will tremendously increase the number of experiments possible at this facility .",
    "antiprotons can be extracted either slow or fast from the lsr and used in several beamlines for e.g. deceleration and cooling in the hitrap facility , or for stopping them in low - density gas targets .",
    "in addition , an electrostatic storage ring is foreseen ( usr ) , which will be used for deceleration , slow and fast extraction , and for atomic physics experiments with internal targets .",
    "the energy range of 300 - 20 kev ( using electron cooling ) makes it a unique tool for many atomic collision experiments which are only possible in such a low - energy storage ring , where effective intensities ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the number of stored particles @xmath6 times the revolution frequency @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) of @xmath9 @xmath1/s are reached for in - ring experiments .",
    "the physics of flair covers a wide range in atomic , nuclear and particle physics and has potential medical applications .",
    "it is described in detail in the flair letter of intent @xcite available from the flair web page . in the following a brief overview",
    "will be given .",
    "this is the current topic of the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) at cern .",
    "the main goal here is to study fundamental symmetries and interactions by providing high - precision data of particle and antiparticle properties for tests of cpt symmetry and qed calculations .",
    "antiprotonic atoms have been used for some time to test cpt symmetry between proton and antiproton properties ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the most accurate test of proton / antiproton properties is the measurement of their cyclotron frequency @xmath10 ( @xmath11 denoting charge and mass ) by the trap collaboration at lear , yielding an accuracy of better than @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "separate cpt limits on @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be set by combining this measurement with the recent precision laser spectroscopy of _ antiprotonic helium _ by the asacusa collaboration at the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) of cern , which are now at a level of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these latter experiment also constitute a sensitive test for three - body qed calculations .",
    "triggered by the spectroscopy results , the accuracy of three - body bound - state qed calculations has been tremendously improved , reaching a level comparable to the experimental resolution @xcite .",
    "a further increase by a factor 10 in precision will be attempted by two - photon laser spectroscopy using a pulse - amplified cw laser .",
    "the pulse - amplification is needed to create enough laser power density to saturate the transitions over the large stopping distribution ( several @xmath16 ) possible at the ad .",
    "increasing the precision beyond this level will be only possible using pure cw lasers .",
    "such lasers produce enough power density if they are focused to typically 1 mm@xmath17 , like it has been done e.  g. for positronium spectroscopy @xcite . using a low - energy cooled antiproton beam as proposed for flair ,",
    "antiprotons can be stopped in a region of this size , and a precision of a few 100 khz can be expected in the spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium .",
    "this can be equally applied to two - body systems like protonium or antiprotonic helium ions .",
    "the ultimately highest precision of a cpt test with antiprotonic atoms is likely to be achieved using _ antihydrogen_. the production of large amounts of cold antihydrogen at the ad has been reported in 2002 @xcite , but it is still expected to take several years until precision spectroscopy can be performed .",
    "after a shutdown in 2005 , the ad is expected to run until 2010 , so that initial results on spectroscopy can be expected at the ad .",
    "the ultimate goal is to measure the 1s2s two - photon laser transition @xcite and the ground state hyperfine splitting @xcite to accuracies similar to the ones achieved for hydrogen ( @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite , resp . ) , yielding a very sensitive test of the cpt theorem .",
    "new ideas like the use of a cusp trap for @xmath20  formation @xcite are being proposed . to achieve the ultimate precision ,",
    "the trapping and laser cooling of neutral antihydrogen atoms is required .",
    "the development of these techniques will surely take many more years to accomplish .",
    "once trapped and laser - cooled antihydrogen is available , other challenging experiments can be performed . among them",
    "is the _ gravitation of antimatter _",
    "@xcite , which is a long standing question that has never been answered experimentally , because in the case of charged particles , gravitational effects are covered by the many orders of magnitude stronger electromagnetic interaction .",
    "collisions between antihydrogen and matter atoms as well as the creation of larger antimatter systems like @xmath20@xmath21 ( one antiproton and two positrons , equivalent to the well known h@xmath22 ion ) are of big interest for atomic collision theory .",
    "this field will greatly benefit from the availability of ultra - slow , cooled antiproton beams in storage rings .",
    "this will enable for the first time ever the detailed study of ionization processes with antiprotons in kinematically complete experiments .",
    "the energy loss can be investigated at ultra - low energies to answer open questions about the velocity dependence in this regime .",
    "antiprotons are best suited for such studies , because unlike protons their charge is not screened by electrons which makes the theoretical treatment very difficult .",
    "the very short interaction time of less than femtoseconds for @xmath1  energies above 1 kev makes antiprotons a perfect and unique tool to study many - electron dynamics in the strongly correlated , non - linear , sub - femtosecond time regime , the most interesting and , at the same time , most challenging domain for theory .      in _ nuclear physics _",
    ", the antiproton is used as a hadronic probe to study the nuclear structure .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of the low - lying states of @xmath1p or other light atoms @xcite gives important information on the nucleon - antinucleon interaction in the low - energy limit , where scattering experiments can not provide precise values .",
    "these data are vital for the improvement of qcd calculations in the low - energy ( hence non - perturbative ) region .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of heavy antiprotonic atoms can be used to obtain information about the density ratio of neutron and protons at the nuclear periphery , _ i.  e. _ to investigate neutron halo or skin effects .",
    "the ps209 experiment at lear has in this way provided benchmark data for nuclear structure calculations over a wide range of nuclei @xcite .",
    "this technique is much more sensitive than others like total absorption cross section measurements , and further systematic measurements with stable isotope targets will provide a more complete and systematic picture of the nuclear surface . since halo effects are expected to be more pronounced in nuclei with a large neutron excess which are unstable , the application of this technique to unstable radioactive ions @xcite available at flair via the superfrs will generate important contributions to the study of the structure of nuclei far from stability .    concerning the _ particle physics _",
    "point of view , the elementary _ antinucleon - nucleon interaction _ processes still present a few unclear aspects @xcite , in spite of the wealth of physics results produced at lear . in particular , some anomalous effects have been observed close to the nucleon - antinucleon threshold which are likely related to the interplay between quark and antiquark degrees of freedom  that could be , for instance , responsible of the existence of quasi - nuclear subthreshold nucleon - antinucleon bound states , long sought for at lear without large success .",
    "an effective way to get a more transparent environment to study the nucleon - antinucleon interaction dynamics , free from coulombian contributions and from a few selected initial states , is the use of _ antineutrons _ as probes .",
    "flair will be able to provide antiproton beams of intensity and momentum resolution good enough to produce a continuous antineutron beam , with which new high statistics measurements of elastic , annihilation and total cross section in the region below 100 mev/@xmath23 , only marginally covered by lear , could be pursued in a relatively short time .",
    "the study of baryon - baryon interactions as a basic tool for investigations of the strong interaction can be extended to the hyperon sector , where much less data exist than in the nucleon sector .",
    "especially few data exist on _ strangeness s @xmath24 _ systems .",
    "stopped antiprotons are very efficient for the production of s @xmath24 systems via the double strangeness and charge exchange reaction ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . with a sizeable branching ratio the annihilation of antiprotons results in the production of a @xmath26 `` beam '' which interacts with another nucleon via @xmath27 .",
    "the momenta of the @xmath26 are well matched for the production of slow @xmath28 particles which undergo efficient @xmath29 interactions .",
    "the proposed studies will result in detailed information of s @xmath24 baryonic and possible dibaryonic states .",
    "recently , interest has been shown in the _ medical application _ of antiprotons for tumor therapy .",
    "this comes from the fact the antiprotons , in addition to depositing energy via their energy loss like other charged particles , annihilate when stopped in material .",
    "the annihilation produces residual nuclear fragments of high charge and low energy , which deposit a large biological dose in the immediate surrounding of the @xmath1  stopping distribution .",
    "since the cooled low - emittance antiproton beams can be stopped in a well - defined region , the presumably large energy deposited locally makes them a suitable tool for tumor therapy .",
    "a test experiment is under way at the ad of cern @xcite and , if this effect is confirmed , the method can be extended at flair where the high - energy antiproton beams ( 50  300 mev ) needed to penetrate deep enough into human tissue are available directly from the nesr .",
    "flair will be a unique next - generation low - energy antiproton and ion facility .",
    "cooled antiprotons down to 20 kev both in storage rings and extracted will revolutionize low - energy antiproton physics .",
    "continuously extracted beams at these energies will enable nuclear and particle physics type experiments currently not possible at the ad of cern .",
    "the availability of short - lived exotic nuclei at the future facility at darmstadt creates synergies by using antiprotons as hadronic probes for nuclear structure .",
    "using the same facility , atomic physics experiments with highly charged ion will be possible both in beams and at rest in hitrap .",
    "if the letter of intent will be positively evaluated , the flair community will proceed towards a more detailed design and procurement of the necessary funding .",
    "i would like to thank the members of the flair steering committee and community who contributed to the combined effort to write the letter of intent and who are working towards the creation of this new facility ."
