    "quantum mechanical systems with a position dependent mass ( pdm ) generate interest for its relevance and importance in describing the physics of many microstructures of current interest , understanding transport phenomena in compositionally graded crystals , designing modern fabrication of nano devices such as quantum dots , wires and wells , developing theoretical models for effective interactions in nuclear physics , neutron stars , liquid crystals , metal clustersserra , barranco , bastard , koc0,geller , arias , harrison , weis , peter , khor , alex , taro , fu , young , von1 .",
    "these applications have stimulated a naturally renewed interest in the solution of pdm quantum mechanical hamiltonians .",
    "recently , solution of the pdm schrdinger equation , dirac equation @xcite and klein - gordon equation @xcite have received much attention .",
    "a number of authors have studied pdm schrdinger equation within the framework of point canonical transformations quesne1,tezcan , chen , mustafa , lie algebraic techniquesroy2,kerimov , yahio , quesne2,dong , roy3,jana , cruz , super symmetric quantum - mechanical quesne3,tanaka , suzko , koc1,bagchi , ganguly , gonul , bagchi1,cannata , or other related techniques roy4,koc2,koc3,gang",

    "pdm schrdinger equation has been transformed in the form of the constant mass schrdinger equation by changing coordinate and wave function .",
    "obviously , this transformation generates isospectral potentials and exact solvability requirements result in constraints on the potential functions for the given mass distributions . in other words , a suitable transformation of coordinate and wave function becomes a bridge between constant mass and position dependent mass schrdinger equation .",
    "as an example in a constant mass schrdinger equation the choice of coordinate @xmath0 and wave function @xmath1 ^{1/4}\\varphi ( x)$ ] provides its transformation in the form of the pdm schrdinger equation . in this case",
    "the potential is mass dependent ; _",
    "i. e_. harmonic oscillator potential can be expressed as @xmath2 and both constant and pdm schrdinger equations have the same eigenvalues .",
    "the origin of such an isospectrality in the constant mass scenario has not yet been studied .",
    "it will be worthwhile to discuss physical acceptability of such an isospectrality in the position dependent mass background .",
    "in some articles @xcite , solution of the pdm schrdinger equation has been obtained without transforming the potential in to mass space . in this case the energy spectrum of the pdm hamiltonians are not isospectral with the constant mass hamiltonians .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to develop a method for solving pdm hamiltonian without transforming the potential into the mass space .",
    "however , the fundamental question remains open : how the potential is affected when it is expressed in the mass space ? to answer this question , one has to obtain a solution for the schrdinger equation without transforming the potential to the mass space . in this article",
    ", we will obtain a semi - analytical solution of the schrdinger equation without transforming the potential to the mass space .",
    "this is another reason , to build a realistic model for solving pdm hamiltonian .",
    "it is well known that the study of the same mathematical problems from different point of view lead to the progress of the science and includes a lot of mathematical tastes . a technique based on asymptotic expansion of taylor series @xcite",
    "has recently been suggested to obtain eigenvalues of schrdinger equation which improves both analytical and numerical determination of the eigenvalues .",
    "asymptotic taylor expansion method ( atem ) is very efficient to obtain eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation because of their simplicity and low round off error .",
    "this method has been easily applied to establish eigenvalues and wave function of the schrdinger type equations .",
    "we would like to mention here that the atem is a field of tremendous scope and has an almost unlimited opportunity , for its applications in the solution of the constant and pdm schrdinger equations . in this paper , we address ourselves to the solution of the pdm schrdinger equation by using the atem .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review construction of atem by reformulating the well known taylor series expansion of a function that satisfies second order homogeneous differential equation of the form : @xmath3 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the application of the main result for solving the pdm schrdinger equation for various forms of the kinetic energy operator . as a practical example",
    ", we illustrate solution of the pdm schrdinger equation including harmonic oscillator potential and variable mass @xmath4 @xcite . in this section",
    ", we present an approximate analytical expression for eigenfunction and numerical results for eigenvalues of the pdm schrdinger equation .",
    "we also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the hamiltonian .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we show the solution of the schrdinger type equation for a quite ample class of potentials , by modifying taylor series expansion by means of a finite sequence instead of an infinite sequence and its termination possessing the property of quantum mechanical wave function .",
    "let us consider taylor series expansion @xcite of a function @xmath5 about the point @xmath6:@xmath7where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 derivative of the function at @xmath6 .",
    "taylor series specifies the value of a function at one point , @xmath10 , in terms of the value of the function and its derivatives at a reference point @xmath6 .",
    "expansion of the function @xmath5 about the origin ( @xmath11 ) , is known as maclaurin s series and it is given by,@xmath12here we develop a method to solve a second order linear differential equation of the form : @xmath13it is obvious that the higher order derivatives of the @xmath5 can be obtained in terms of the @xmath5 and @xmath14 by differentiating ( a2 ) .",
    "then , higher order derivatives of @xmath5 are given by@xmath15where@xmath16of course , the last result shows there exist a formal relation between asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite and atem .",
    "we have observed that eigenfunction of the  schrdinger type equations can efficiently be determined by using atem .",
    "it is clear that the recurrence relations ( a4 ) allow us algebraic exact or approximate analytical expression for the solution of ( [ a2 ] ) under some certain conditions .",
    "let us substitute ( a4 ) into the ( [ a1 ] ) to obtain@xmath17after all , we have obtained useful formalism of the taylor expansion method . in the solution of the eigenvalue problems , truncation of the the asymptotic expansion to a finite number of terms is useful .",
    "if the series optimally truncated at the smallest term then the asymptotic expansion of series is known as superasymptotic @xcite , and it leads to the determination of eigenvalues with minimum error . then boundary conditions can be applied as follows .",
    "when only odd or even power of @xmath10 collected as coefficients of @xmath18 or @xmath19 and vice verse , the series is truncated at @xmath20 then an immediate practical consequence of these condition for @xmath21 or @xmath22 in this way , one of the parameter in the @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 belongs to the spectrum of the schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore eigenfunction of the equation becomes a polynomial of degree @xmath25 .",
    "otherwise the spectrum of the system can be obtained as follows : in a quantum mechanical system eigenfunction of the system is discrete . therefore in order to terminate the eigenfunction @xmath5 we can concisely write that@xmath26eliminating @xmath27 and @xmath19 we obtain@xmath28again one of the parameter in the equation related to the eigenvalues of the problem .    in quantum mechanics",
    "bound state energy of the atom is quantized and eigenvalues are discrete and for each eigenvalues there exist one or more eigenfunctions .",
    "when we are dealing with the solution of the schrdinger equation , we are mainly interested in the discrete eigenvalues of the problem .",
    "the first main result of this conclusion gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the termination of the taylor series expansion of the wave function .",
    "the process presented here is iterative and number of iteration is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the results are obtained as follows : in our mathematica program , we use an iteration number , say @xmath30 , then we obtain another result for @xmath31 , so on , then we compare values of the parameter ( eigenvalue ) in each case till @xmath32 digits .",
    "if values of the parameter reach its asymptotic value then we use these values and omit the others .",
    "for instance , if one can obtain values of the parameters for @xmath31 , first few of them will be reached its asymptotic values , say first @xmath33 values .",
    "the following comment for the function is considerable : for such a solution it is suitable to take sum of first @xmath33 term in the ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "it will be shown that atem gives accurate results for pdm schrdinger equations . in the following sections",
    ", it is shown that this approach opens the way to the treatment of  pdm  schrdinger equation including large class of potentials of practical interest .",
    "in the pdm schrdinger equation the mass and momentum operator no longer commute , so there are several ways to define kinetic energy operator . the general expression for the hamiltonian with the kinetic energy operator introduced by von roos@xcite and potential energy @xmath34 ,",
    "can be written as:@xmath35where @xmath36 is a constraint and @xmath37 is position dependent mass .",
    "there are many debates for the choice of the parameters @xmath38 @xmath39and @xmath40 , in our approach , we will obtain the solution of the pdm schrdinger equation for the following hamiltonians @xcite :    @xmath41    here we take a new look at the solution of the the pdm schrdinger equation by using the method of atem developed in the previous section .    before going further we share one of our significant observation during our calculations .",
    "if the mass distribution is not appropriate for a given potential , the eigenvalues do not reach their asymptotic values and resultant eigenfunction can not be terminated when @xmath42 . in order to illustrate semi analytical solution of the eigenvalue equations    @xmath43",
    "including harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath44 , we use the mass distributions @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is arbitrary positive constant . by the way",
    ", we emphasize that the wave function of harmonic oscillator potential is well defined in the region of @xmath47 and satisfy that @xmath48 in this limit the mass distributions to be continuous .",
    "it is well known that asymptotic behavior of constant mass schrdinger equation including harmonic oscillator potential is given by @xmath49 for simplicity we set @xmath50thus , this change of wave function guaranties @xmath51 .",
    "after this transformation , we present an iteration algorithm to calculate both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) . using this algorithm",
    ", we develop a mathematica program , which demonstrates that it is easier to be implemented into a computer program , and produces a highly accurate solution with analytical expression efficiently .",
    "the term asymptotic means the function approaching to a given value as the iteration number tends to infinity . by the aid of a mathematica program we calculate eigenvalues and eigenfunction of @xmath52 for @xmath53  using number of iterations @xmath54,@xmath55 .",
    "the function @xmath5 for @xmath56 state is given in ( [ eq:4 ] ) and eigenvalues are presented in table i.    @xmath57    our calculation gives an accurate result for first @xmath33 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions after @xmath58 iterations .",
    "here we have used @xmath59 iterations .",
    "figure 1 shows the plot of normalized wave functions for first @xmath60 state .",
    ".eigenvalues of the pdm @xmath52 for different iteration numbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results given in table ii shows that eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are also depends on the choices of the parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 of hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the solution of the pdm schrdinger equation without mapping the potential in to the mass space .",
    "we have solved pdm schrdinger equation for four different kinetic energy operators including harmonic oscillator potential with the variable mass function of the form @xmath65 .",
    "it is shown that energy levels of the pdm schrdinger equation depends on the mass distributions .",
    "it is important to remark that the results presented here , shows that eigenvalues also depends on the ordering parameters of the pdm schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we have presented an approximate method based on asymptotic taylor series expansion of a function .",
    "fortunately , this method is useful for obtaining both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the schrdinger type equations .",
    "therefore , the results have been obtained here , allowing further comparisons between the models .    as a further work the method presented here",
    "can be used to built more realistic models for the pdm physical systems . before ending this work",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "when the potential mapped to the mass space , the both constant and pdm hamiltonian has the same eigenvalues",
    ". it will be worthwhile to discuss physical acceptability of such an isospectrality in the position dependent mass background .",
    "therefore we have to develop methods for solving pdm schrdinger equation without connecting mass to potential or vice versa .",
