    "previous experimental results on ccd radiation hardness were reported for example in  @xcite .",
    "several models increased the understanding of radiation damage effects in ccds  @xcite . the measurements and analyses reported in this paper",
    "have been carried out in the lcfi collaboration  @xcite .",
    "simulation and modelling of ccd radiation hardness effects for a ccd prototype with sequential readout was reported at ieee2005  @xcite , comparing full tcad simulations with analytic models was reported at ieee2006  @xcite and in ref .",

    "the environment with high radiation near the interaction point at a future linear collider creates damage to the ccd material which leads to defects acting as electron traps in the silicon , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation_damage ] . the mechanism of creating traps has been discussed in the literature , for example in refs .",
    "these traps result in charge transfer inefficiency . in a phosphorus - doped device ,",
    "two types of traps are created .",
    "the first one is relatively shallow with energy level @xmath3  ev below the conduction band and the second is deep with energy level @xmath4  ev below the conduction band .",
    "these traps result in charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "the column parallel technology is in development to cope with the required readout rate .",
    "cpc1 is a two - phase ccd prototype capable of @xmath5  mhz readout frequency . in this paper",

    "[ fig : radiation_damage ]",
    "a test stand has been set up with readout electronics and a cryostat unit .",
    "the temperature range of the cryostat is from room temperature down to about @xmath6c .",
    "this temperature has been achieved with cold nitrogen gas by boiling liquid nitrogen .",
    "the very low operating temperature is required to obtain sensitivity to the cti peak structure for @xmath3  ev traps where the peak position is expected to be near @xmath7c  @xcite .",
    "initial measurements have been performed on an un - irradiated device in standalone mode , where the signal from four columns of the ccd were amplified and connected to external adcs .",
    "an @xmath8fe source emitting @xmath9  kev x - rays was attached to a holder at a distance of @xmath10  cm from the ccd to provide the signal charge .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpccd_electronics_photo ] shows a picture of cpc1 and the associated control and front - end readout electronics , which were also placed in the cryostat , wherefrom the four outputs were fed to rack - mounted amplifiers and adcs .",
    "it was observed that the cti increased sharply when the amplitude of the sinusoidal clock pulses applied to read out the ccd was reduced to less than @xmath11  v peak - to - peak . in order to suppress any effect from the clock amplitude ,",
    "settings for each data acquisition were tuned to produce @xmath12 clock pulses .",
    "the performance of the drivers limited the maximum clocking frequency to about @xmath13  mhz . the settings depended on the frequency and had to be adjusted for each cryostat temperature .",
    "the fast adcs convert the signal charge after amplification with a wideband preamplifier .",
    "the four columns are read out in 4 channels by adcs .",
    "three columns ( channels 1 to 3 ) are adjacent whereas channel 4 is separate .",
    "the signal charges of 400 pixels plus 10 overclocks were acquired in 30005000 frames per measurement .",
    "this leads to an accurate statistical precision .",
    "the collected data has been analysed using the root package  @xcite .",
    "first , we begin by applying correlated double sampling , where the difference between the signals of two consecutive pixels is taken to be the signal charge collected by the latter pixel .",
    "this decreases electronic noise .",
    "next , we remove common mode noise components for each column with the help of the overclocks .",
    "overclocks are charges read out after the last pixel of the column .",
    "we average all overclocks of a column and subtract the average from the data of all pixels in the column . as an example for channel 2 fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_noisepeak ] shows the distribution of adc codes for all recorded pixels and all frames of one measurement .",
    "the analysis is performed on column 2 because it is situated between columns 1 and 3 .",
    "this allows to apply a 3@xmath143 cluster method .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit_noisepeak ] illustrates that there are 3 regions in adc codes .",
    "the first region ( i ) has a high number of pixels with low adc codes from electronics noise only ( no charge from x - rays ) .",
    "the noise is fitted by a gaussian function in order to determine the noise threshold .",
    "the charge - sharing region ( ii ) represents the signal charge shared between 2 or more pixels .",
    "region ( iii ) is the signal region where the charge is collected in a single pixel that will be analysed to determine the cti .    in order to remove hits with shared charges ,",
    "a 3@xmath143 cluster method is used ( fig .  [ fig:3by3_clustering ] ) .",
    "this method is only applied to the 3 adjacent columns ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "column 2 is considered , where the signal charge of a pixel is accepted only if no x - ray charge is present in the neighboring pixels .",
    "the noise threshold is used to separate noise from shared x - ray charges .",
    "it is determined by fitting the noise peak with a gaussian function .",
    "the threshold is usually set to be @xmath15 above the fitted peak centroid .",
    "after removal of the noise and reduction of the charge - sharing events , a tail remains for the x - ray peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : further_removing_1 ] . in order to separate the x - ray signal region from the charge - sharing region",
    "we exclude all adc codes below an x - ray threshold which is determined by fitting the x - ray peak .",
    "we usually set the threshold to be @xmath16 below the fitted peak centroid but with weaker x - ray peaks the fitted gaussian sometimes failed to follow the real shape of the peak , and then the limits were set by visual inspection . in this way we obtain the measured x - ray signal data in the pixels with full x - ray charge ( fig .",

    "this is a different dataset than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_noisepeak ] , which was obtained using a higher preamplifier gain . ]",
    "owing to an rc coupling at the preamplifier input , the output voltage decays exponentially with a time constant equal to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is of the order of @xmath20s )  mhz reading out the whole column of 400 pixels takes a time comparable to @xmath19 . ] .",
    "this is expected to give rise to an exponential baseline that varies during the clocking sequence , adding a contribution to the readout signal that depends on the pixel number .",
    "the shape of the baseline can be determined by comparing the average output level in the pixels to each other . for each pixel",
    "an average of the adc codes was computed excluding the frames were the code exceeded the noise threshold .",
    "the average adc code can usually be expected to be an exponential function of the pixel number with the rc decay .",
    "figures  [ fig : baseline_2_60 ] ,  [ fig : baseline_4_6 ] ,  [ fig : baseline_8_17 ] and  [ fig : baseline_8_109 ] show the distributions of the average adc codes for all frames of a measurement as a function of the pixel number for different readout frequencies and operating temperatures .",
    "these distributions are fitted by an exponential function given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 corresponds to the signal charge at the first pixel , @xmath23 is the slope and @xmath24 is the pixel number .",
    "this function will be subtracted from the x - ray data .",
    "figures  [ fig : baseline_2_60 ] and  [ fig : baseline_8_109 ] show approximately zero baseline level , whereas figs .  [",
    "fig : baseline_4_6 ] and  [ fig : baseline_8_17 ] show non - zero baseline fits .",

    "[ fig : baseline_8_109 ] ) . figures  [ fig : baseline_4_6 ] and  [ fig : baseline_8_17 ] show baselines for higher temperatures @xmath27c and @xmath28c , respectively .",
    "the observed baselines show different frequency and temperature dependence from what is expected from the rc effect .",
    "this indicates that other electronic effects also influence the baseline .",

    "the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) in one pixel is defined as the ratio of signal lost during transfer ( captured by traps ) to the initial signal charge . for an un - irradiated ccd",
    "we expect that the cti value is consistent with zero within uncertainties . in order to determine the cti we first make the overclock correction and apply the @xmath40 cluster method .",
    "then , the x - ray peak was fitted with the gaussian function to determine the x - ray threshold .",

    "the cti has been calculated using two methods , a linear fit of averages versus pixel number and using a linear fit of events ( x - ray hits ) versus pixel number . as it is expected for an un - irradiated ccd ,",

    "no frequency dependence of the cti measurements is observed .",
