    "the redshift interval from @xmath7 @xmath8 0 to 1 accounts for roughly half of the universe s age , and provides a valuable range to study the final stages of galaxy assembly .",
    "it is well known that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies has diminished since z @xmath8 1 ( @xcite ) , with cowie et al .",
    "coining the term  downsizing \" to describe this behaviour .",
    "this suggests that the most massive galaxies finished their star formation earlier than less massive systems , a trend observed in broad - band colors ( @xcite ) , and radio ( @xcite ) and infrared ( @xcite ) data .",
    "however , the reasons why star formation in the universe has been decreasing and why it stops for any given galaxy are still unresolved .    feedback processes may play an important role in regulating the mass growth of galaxies and/or producing downsizing , with their physical origin having received much attention .",
    "some processes implemented in numerical and semi - analytic models include regulation through feedback by supernovae ( @xcite ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) by reduction of gas cooling and outflows of reheated gas ( @xcite ) . the most accepted cosmological model ,",
    "however , predicts that the formation of galaxies is hierarchical , with massive ellipticals being the result of both a series of mergers between smaller galaxies and by gas accretion . in this scenario without taking into account feedback processes , elliptical galaxies continue accreting gas and forming stars . as this",
    "is not observed in present day galaxies , it is important to understand the agn activity at @xmath7 @xmath9 1 as a feedback source .",
    "indeed , although agn feedback is expected to occur more often in more massive galaxies ( @xcite ) , it is also interesting to test its occurrence in low - mass galaxies .",
    "galaxies show a wide variety of physical and observational properties , with their morphologies correlating with their colors , and also with characteristics of their stellar populations .",
    "the properties such as optical colors ( @xcite ) , morphological parameters ( @xcite ) , and spectral indices ( @xcite ) , come from a bimodal distribution which defines two classes of galaxies : a red population of passive galaxies that have formed their stellar masses mostly at high redshift , and a blue population that is actively forming stars .",
    "this bimodal distribution is present at least up to @xmath7 @xmath8 1 - 2 ( @xcite ) , but its origin is still not clear .",
    "the best scenario to explain these properties may be evolutive , as galaxies in different phases of their evolution reveal different colors , star formation rates , spectral indexes and morphologies . nevertheless , it is still unresolved how these different parameters are connected .",
    "there is some evidence for a possible role of agn in the transition area between the `` blue cloud '' and the `` red sequence '' on the color@xmath0magnitude and color@xmath0mass diagrams ( @xcite ) , a region also known as the `` green valley '' .",
    "agn hosts tend to have redder colors than the bulk of star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) , suggesting that they might cause or maintain the quenching of star formation in early - type star - forming galaxies ( @xcite , for more discussion ) .",
    "however , in the local universe , type 2 agns ( seyferts ) are mainly hosted in young massive star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) , thus implying a close link between the growth of black holes ( bhs ) and bulges .",
    "about half of the sources with moderate x - ray luminosities ( moderately luminous agn ) detected in deep x - ray surveys do not show broad lines or high excitation lines characteristic of agn in their optical spectra , indicating that the optical line selection of agn is incomplete ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , agns with high column densities of absorbing gas and dust clouds ( combined with those located in the host galaxy ) may be missed in x - rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that current x - ray and optical surveys are biased against the early phase of bh evolution . at its initial stage of formation , agn might be deeply buried under star - forming clouds and/or show low luminosity , because although the bh mass is growing rapidly it is small .",
    "therefore , it might be possible to use mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths to locate these dusty agns by probing emission from agn - heated dust .",
    "moreover , this wavelength range is much less affected by extinction and is able to penetrate through the dusty envelope surrounding the agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "defining a galaxy population that contributes to a decrease in the sfr over cosmic time has strong implications for theories of galaxy evolution . in this investigation",
    "we studied the physical properties of a sample of 37 emission line galaxies at 0 @xmath9 @xmath7 @xmath9 1 , which were detected in mir ( _ spitzer _ ) for which the multiwavelength photometry and optical spectra were available .",
    "this sample formed part of a spectroscopic survey pilot project in the subaru xmm deep field ( sxdf ) out to @xmath7 @xmath8 2.5 , with the purpose of investigating the end of star formation in massive galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath10[sample ] we describe the sample selection ; @xmath10[obs ] gives details on the acquisition of the spectrophotometric data ; @xmath10[reduc ] explains the reduction process applied to the data ; @xmath10[results ] summarizes the final sample used in this paper ; in @xmath10[agn ] we investigate star formation and the agn activity of our galaxies using optical , mass - excitation ( mex ) and mir diagnostic diagrams ; in @xmath10[prop ] the physical properties of our galaxy sample are derived using the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting technique , and the relationships between sfr , specific sfr ( ssfr ) , and sfr surface density ( @xmath3 ) are investigated as a function of redshift , stellar mass and color .",
    "finally , in @xmath10[sum ] we summarize our results and analysis .    throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed a flat @xmath11-dominated cosmology with @xmath12 = 0.28 , @xmath13 = 0.72 , and @xmath14 = 70 km s@xmath15mpc .",
    "the galaxies presented in this paper are a subset of a sample constructed to study star formation and the agn activity of massive galaxies in the redshift range @xmath7 = 0.1@xmath02.5 , with the parent sample being chosen from the sxdf ( @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of the sxdf is that it has been observed in many photometric bands : @xmath16 ( subaru ) ;",
    "@xmath17 ( ukirt , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* as reference project ) ) ; and 3.6@xmath18 m , 4.5@xmath18 m , 5.8@xmath18 m , 8.0@xmath18 m , 24@xmath18 m , 70@xmath18 m and 160@xmath18 m ( _ spitzer _ ) .",

    "therefore , one can apply a number of photometric criteria in order to select galaxies with different characteristics . in our particular case",
    ", the parent sample was selected using the @xmath53646 balmer and @xmath54000 break features as tracers of redshift , as described by daddi et al .",
    "@xcite , using the bzk color@xmath0color diagram to select star - forming galaxies in a specific redshift range , independently of the dust reddening .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the survey was set to k @xmath9 23 ab mag , with an additional requirement being that the source had a counterpart in all uv@xmath0optical@xmath0nir bands .",
    "a total of 4 different fields were observed using 4 masks , which produced 417 spectra of the selected targets .",
    "however , only 132 of these spectra had the necessary signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio for our purposes ( see sections [ imacs ] and [ gmos ] ) .",
    "additionally , out of these 132 spectra , we selected only those galaxies that showed the necessary emission lines in order to locate them in at least one of the baldwin , phillips and terlevich ( @xcite , hereafter bpt ) diagnostic diagrams ( i.e. h@xmath204861 @xmath21 , [ oiii]@xmath55007 , h@xmath66563 @xmath21 and [ nii]@xmath56548 , 6583 emission lines ) , or those presented by lamareille @xcite and juneau et al .",
    "@xcite to identify star formation and agn activity in galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "these latter two diagrams are particularly useful for galaxies at @xmath7 @xmath22 0.5 , since the emission lines h@xmath6 and [ nii ] are beyond the spectral coverage for an optical spectrograph .",
    "lamareille @xcite used the flux ratio [ oiii](@xmath55007)/h@xmath20(@xmath54861 ) versus the equivalent width ratio [ oii](@xmath53727)/h@xmath20(@xmath54861 ) , while juneau et al .",
    "@xcite employed the flux ratio [ oiii](@xmath55007)/h@xmath20(@xmath54861 ) versus the stellar mass . both of these approaches can be applied out to @xmath7 @xmath9 1.0 , because the emission lines h@xmath20 and [ oiii ] are beyond the spectral coverage at higher redshifts .",
    "these constraints allowed us to explore the interplay between agn and star formation in galaxies at 0 @xmath9 @xmath7 @xmath9 1 , independent of the dust reddening , and to comparing different optical selection methods normally employed to study these populations .",
    "note that the presence of the aforementioned emission lines implies a galaxy sample with evidence of recent star formation activity , thus favoring the selection of late - type galaxies , where star formation and agn activity is usually found .",
    "in addition to the photometry available for the sxdf , we obtained @xmath23-band data along with optical spectroscopy for a broader and more accurate study of the physical properties of the galaxies .      the @xmath23-band photometry was obtained in order to provide better constraints over the uv sfr values derived from sed fitting , and also to select lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at redshifts @xmath7 @xmath22 2.0 .",
    "the latter will be used in future research .",
    "the @xmath23-band images were obtained under photometric conditions during 2006 september 16@xmath017 , and 19@xmath020 ( pi : n. padilla ) using the mosaicii camera attached to the prime focus of the blanco telescope at ctio .",

    "spectroscopic data were obtained during 2007 december 11@xmath012 ( pi : n. padilla ) using the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) attached to the magellan telescope at lco .",
    "spectra were taken using the short camera mode @xmath25/2 configuration with a 200 lines / mm grating . in this mode ,",
    "the total field of view was 27.2@xmath2427.2 and the dispersion 2.04 @xmath21/pixel , which gave a wavelength coverage from 450 nm to 900 nm .",
    "observations were carried out using a multi - slit mask with 227 slits .",
    "the slit size adopted was of 1 `` aperture , consistent with the average seeing during the observations .",
    "the typical angular sizes of our targets were of 4 '' , and during the run 10@xmath241800 s frames were obtained , which gave a total integration time of 18000 s. the targets selected in the sxdf were centered at r.a .",

    "the reduction process for the mosaic @xmath23-band data was performed using the iraf package _ mscred _ , mainly following the noao deep wide field survey notes .",
    "this process includes bias , flat field and world coordinate system ( wcs ) astrometric corrections , together with a projection onto a standard coordinate system and image scale on single images .",
    "reduced images were finally stacked into a single image that was complete up to a total magnitude of @xmath23=24.5 ab mag .",
    "the imacs / magellan spectra were reduced using the carnegie observatories system for multi object spectroscopy ( cosmos ) routines , which are based on an accurate optical model of imacs that predicts ( after alignment and calibration ) a precise description of the spectral features ( position , angle , scale ) . in this way",
    ", the process of visual line searching is improved .",
    "the reduction process includes corrections by zero and flat frames , subtraction of the sky lines and background , and spectral extraction .",
    "the cosmos routines produce a 3d image formed by layers that contain the 2d spectrum corresponding to the mask slits , so the 2d spectra for each of the exposures were combined into a single 3d image . during this final process",
    ", the cosmic rays were removed .",
    "the 1d spectrum extraction process was carried out using the _ apall _ routine , while the flux calibration was performed using the _ calibrate _ routine , all belonging to iraf . however , due to parasite light problems , only 44 spectra had a good enough s / n ratio to measure a secure redshift .",
    "therefore , considering that the original mask had 227 slits , the success rate was 19@xmath1 .",
    "the reduction process was carried out using the _ gemini - gmos _ routines within iraf , adopting the usual factors including bias and flat - field corrections , n@xmath26s sky substraction , and wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "the reduced 2d spectra were processed to recover the positive and negative spectra in order to join them in a single 2d spectrum using standard iraf routines .",

    "similar problems were encountered as those described in the previous section . from 190 slits arranged in 3 masks ,",
    "a secure redshift was only obtained for 89 spectra , representing a success rate of 46@xmath1 .",
    "fluxes of the emission lines were measured using the _ splot _ routine within iraf , adopting the gaussian mode as it provides an adequate representation of the observed line profiles . prior to taking the emission line measurements ,",
    "the spectrum of the underlying stellar population was subtracted in order to produce a pure emission line spectrum .",
    "this is particularly important since both the h@xmath20 and h@xmath6 emission lines are affected by balmer stellar absorption .",
    "furthermore , prior to the emission line measurements , the aperture photometry was used to correct errors in the spectra due to flux loss .",
    "stellar template spectra were obtained from stellar population synthesis models as described in section [ sed ] .",
    "based on the technique applied to sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies by tremonti et al .",
    "@xcite , the calculated @xmath27- , @xmath28- , @xmath29- , @xmath30- , @xmath7-band fluxes were compared with the fluxes from the spectrum .",
    "the correction factor for each spectrum was estimated as the average of the flux ratio between the aperture photometry and the continuum calculated for each filter , with typical values of such corrections being about 30@xmath1 .",
    "the flux limit in the emission lines was 4@xmath2410@xmath31 erg s@xmath15@xmath32 at the 3@xmath33 level . in h@xmath6 ,",
    "this value corresponded to a limit in the sfr of @xmath80.0001 @xmath34/yr at @xmath7=0.045 , and of @xmath80.1 @xmath34/yr , for the most distant galaxy of our sample at @xmath7=0.93 .",

    "we assumed a salpeter initial mass function ( imf , salpeter @xcite ) and two types of star formation histories ( sfhs ) : passive evolution of stars ( single burst ; i.e. simple stellar population , ssp ) and an exponentially declining one ( sfr(@xmath35 ) @xmath8 @xmath36 , with @xmath37 spanning [ 0.25gyr ; 15gyr ] ) . a dust reddening law ( @xcite )",
    "was applied to each template using @xmath2 values spanning [ 0 ; 0.5 ] ( see section [ dust ] for more details ) .",
    "then , a least - squares @xmath38 fitting method was used to obtain the best template that matched the dominant stellar population , with emission lines being masked prior to the fitting . by using these templates the stellar mass of the sample galaxies was estimated , which revealed values of total stellar masses in the range 10@xmath3910@xmath40 . to avoid the age@xmath0metallicity degeneracy of the sed fits , a constant metallicity of z=0.004 was used .",
    "this value was taken as the mean metallicity value found in galaxies that had the same stellar mass range as our galaxies ( @xcite ) , ignoring possible mass@xmath0metallicity evolution .    both total and aperture photometry of the galaxies",
    "were used to perform sed fitting .",
    "the @xmath41 , @xmath17 aperture magnitudes were calculated in a diaphragm with the same aperture of the slit as that used for spectroscopy ( 1 \" ) , with sextractor code being used to obtain the magnitudes .",
    "the photometric data roughly covered the range 3550@xmath022.000 @xmath21 , which allowed us to be able to estimate the stellar continuum beyond the spectral coverage of the individual spectra ( 4500@xmath010000 @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , the set of possible solutions for each of our galaxies obtained by galaxev was substantially reduced . throughout this paper ,",
    "all the physical properties of the galaxies are relative to the spectroscopy aperture except for stellar masses .",
    "aperture photometry parameters were used to compare them directly to the properties derived from the spectra ( reddening , sfr ) and to compute color index and age , whereas total magnitudes were used to compute total stellar masses ( section 7.3 ) .",
    "a 90@xmath1 confidence interval was used to determine the uncertainties of the derived physical properties .",

    "agn emission lines are due to non - thermal ionizing sources and/or shocks , while in star forming ( or hii ) galaxies they originate from hot young stars",

    "<S> we present a spectroscopic study with the derivation of the physical properties of 37 balmer break galaxies , which have the necessary lines to locate them in star - forming@xmath0active galactic nuclei ( agn ) diagnostic diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies span a redshift range from 0.045 to 0.93 and are somewhat less massive than similar samples of previous works . </S>",
    "<S> the studied sample has multiwavelength photometric data coverage from the ultraviolet to mid - infrared ( mir ) _ spitzer _ bands . </S>",

    "<S> star - forming galaxies , 2 ( 5@xmath1 ) composite galaxies and 3 ( 8@xmath1 ) agns were classified , whereas from the mex diagram only one galaxy was classified as agn . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 19 galaxies have photometry available in all the irac/_spitzer _ bands . of these </S>",
    "<S> , 3 agn candidates were not classified as agn in the optical diagrams , suggesting they are dusty / obscured agns , or that nuclear star formation has diluted their contributions . by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we derived the stellar masses , dust reddening @xmath2 , ages and uv star formation rates ( sfrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the relationship between sfr surface density ( @xmath3 ) and stellar mass surface density per time unit ( @xmath4 ) as a function of redshift was investigated using the [ oii ] @xmath53727 , 3729 , h@xmath6 @xmath56563 luminosities , which revealed that both quantities are larger for higher redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the sfr and specific sfr ( ssfr ) versus stellar mass and color relations , with the more massive galaxies having higher sfr values but lower ssfr values than less massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with previous ones showing that , at a given mass , high - redshift galaxies have on average larger sfr and ssfr values than low - redshift galaxies . finally , bluer galaxies have larger ssfr values than redder galaxies and for a given color the ssfr is larger for higher redshift galaxies . </S>"
