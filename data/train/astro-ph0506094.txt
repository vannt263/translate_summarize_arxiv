    "the internal structure of galaxies , the spectrophotometric , chemical , and dynamical properties at various locations within a galaxy , is determined by the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "stars in a galaxy are fossils ; the star formation and chemical enrichment history of the galaxy are imprinted on their kinematics and chemical abundances . the sauron project with the william herschel telescope ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is providing wide - field mapping of the kinematics and stellar populations of nearby galaxies , which will certainly give stringent constraints on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "multiobject and integral field spectrographs are being developed also on 8 - 10 m ground - based telescopes , which will provide the time evolution of such internal structure . to infer the physical evolution processes from the observational data ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a realistic model , i.e. , a three - dimensional chemodynamical model , and to compare the theoretical predictions with such observational data .",
    "how elliptical galaxies form is a long - standing matter of debate .",
    "two competing scenarios for the formation of elliptical galaxies have been proposed ; the monolithic collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the major merger ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in kobayashi ( 2004 , hereafter k04 ) , we constructed a self - consistent three - dimensional chemodynamical model of ellipticals , introducing various physical processes associated with the formation of stellar systems ; radiative cooling , star formation , feedback of type ii and ia supernovae ( sne ii and sne ia ) , and stellar winds ( sws ) , and chemical enrichment .",
    "we then argued that both formation processes should arise to explain the observed variation in radial metallicity gradients .",
    "the metallicity is enhanced in the central dense region , and the metallicity gradients are generated . however , because merging events weaken the metallicity gradients , and because the secondary star burst induced by the mergers is not enough to regenerate them , galaxies that form monolithically have steeper gradients , while galaxies that undergo major mergers have shallower gradients .",
    "therefore no correlation is found between the mass and gradients , as in the observation ( @xcite ) .    while the internal structure of elliptical galaxies is greatly affected by their merging histories , their global properties",
    "should be determined from their masses according to the scaling relations .",
    "differences in merging history may provide the scatter in these relations . in this paper , we investigate whether our simulated galaxies follow the observed correlations ; the faber - jackson relation , the kormendy relation , the colour - magnitude relation , the mass - metallicity relation and the fundamental plane ( fp ) .    the fp is a correlation of early - type galaxies with @xmath2 parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) that reflect the internal structures , and is a clue to understand formation and evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "one possible interpretation of the fp , defined by central velocity dispersions @xmath3 , absolute effective radii r@xmath4 , and surface brightnesses within an effective radius sb@xmath4 attributes it to a correlation of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath5 to the total luminosity , or equivalently , to the total galaxy mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath5 on the mass and luminosity stems from the stellar metallicity and/or age ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , elliptical galaxies may not be homologous along the fp , and there remains a dispersion that is not due to observational error . this may be caused by metallicity , age , and/or dynamical disturbance .",
    "the fp is observed up to @xmath6 in clusters ( @xcite , 2000 ) , which is understood as the evidence for passive evolution since @xmath7 . for field galaxies ,",
    "a comparable correlation is observed up to @xmath8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the larger scatter than in clusters and the zero - point offset at higher redshifts can be interpreted as an age difference , although other possibilities such as dynamical disturbance have not yet been discussed .",
    "the details of our grape - sph chemodynamical code were described in k04 , and we briefly summarize them in  [ sec : model ] . following the discussion in k04 , we vary the parameters controlling star formation and the initial mass function , and we show how these affect global properties and their correlations (  [ sec : param ] ) . with the best parameter set ,",
    "we show the scaling relations of simulated galaxies comparing with the observations .",
    "we focus on the fundamental plane , and discuss the origin of the scatter in  [",
    "sec : correlation ] .",

    "the characteristics of our grape - sph code may be summarized as follows ( see k04 for the detail ) .",
    "\\i ) the sph method ( @xcite for a review ) is adopted , and the gravity is calculated in direct summation using the special purpose computer grape ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sph formulation used in the code is almost the same as in @xcite .",
    "the grape - sph code was originally written by @xcite , and is highly adaptive in space and time through individual smoothing lengths and individual timesteps .",
    "the calculations were done with the grape5 system in the national astronomical observatory of japan and the grape6 of the university of tokyo .",
    "\\ii ) * radiative cooling * is computed using a metallicity - dependent cooling function . for primordial gas ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 ) , we compute the cooling rates using the two - body processes of h and he , and free - free emission , as in @xcite . for metal enriched gas ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 ) , we use a metallicity - dependent cooling function computed with the mappings iii software ( @xcite ) . in this cooling function , the elemental abundance ratios are set to be constant for given [ fe / h ] according to the relations found in the solar neighborhood .",
    "[ o / fe]@xmath11 for galactic halo stars for [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , and solar values for [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",
    "we interpolate between these values for @xmath14 [ fe / h ] @xmath15 .",
    "\\iii ) our * star formation * criteria are the same as in @xcite ; ( 1 ) converging flow ; @xmath16 , ( 2 ) rapid cooling ; @xmath17 , and ( 3 ) jeans unstable gas ; @xmath18 .",
    "the star formation timescale is proportional to the dynamical timescale ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 is our star formation timescale parameter .",
    "we also adopt the probability criterion ( @xcite ) ; a random number between 0 and 1 is compared with the probability @xmath21 $ ] in a time interval @xmath22 myr .    if a gas particle satisfies the above star formation criteria , a fractional part of the mass of the gas particle turns into a star particle .",
    "since an individual star particle has a mass of @xmath23 , it dose not represent a single star , but an association of many stars .",
    "the mass of the stars associated with each star particle is distributed according to an initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we adopt a power - law imf , @xmath24 ( the slope @xmath25 gives the salpeter imf ) , which is invariant to time and metallicity .",
    "in  [ sec : param ] , we discuss the dependence of our results on our free parameters ; the star formation timescale @xmath20 and the slope of the imf @xmath26 . in order to reproduce the observed radius - magnitude relation and mass - metallicity relation ,",

    ".number of simulated galaxies [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as well as the observed dwarfs , the variation of the star formation histories is seen for our simulated dwarfs with @xmath28 mag .",
    "we classify these into the 4 classes ; [ d1 ] initial starburst , [ d2 ] continuous star formation , [ d3 ] continuous star formation with recent starburst , and [ d4 ] recent starburst .",
    "observationally , the first class of galaxies would be dwarf ellipticals , the others are dwarf irregulars . the star formation rate ( sfr ) is truncated in [ d1 ] because of the supernova feedback .",
    "the intermittent sfr is induced by the gas accretion and/or interaction with other galaxies . in the following sections",
    ", we show the results both for giant and dwarf galaxies , but we should note that our numerical resolution in the dwarf galaxies is not enough ; the particle number in a galaxy is small ( @xmath29 in the worst case ) and the gravitational softening ( @xmath30 kpc for the low resolution ) is comparable to the size of galaxies .    all simulated ellipticals form with an initial starburst at @xmath31 with the typical timescale of @xmath32 gyr .",
    "the sfr decreases because the gas is exhausted in the galaxy .",
    "the secondary starburst is induced by the accretion of gas clumps and/or the merging of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "not all merging events induce a secondary starburst ; the fraction of merging events induce such a starburst is about @xmath33 , depending on the gas mass of the secondary galaxy .",
    "the initial starburst is always larger than the secondary one .    as discussed in k04 ,",
    "such a truncating sfr is due to the artificial cut - off of mass accretion caused by the vacuum boundary of our initial conditions .",
    "however , if we simulate wider region , the star formation continues longer , and thus colours tend to be too blue .",
    "the mass accretion can be continued but the star formation should have stopped by some process by @xmath34 in cluster ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath35 in field ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an analogous truncation is required such as tidal stripping and effects of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "eventually , although the dark matter halo may be affected , the stellar population does not change so much .",
    "contrary to the observational constraints , galactic winds are hard to generate in our simulations , and star formation does not completely stop by @xmath36 in most simulated elliptical galaxies . at the centre of the present - day galaxy ,",
    "the dynamical potential is so deep that the gas density is high . in such regions , super metal - rich stars ( @xmath37 )",
    "keep on forming in the simulation . in several dwarf galaxies with @xmath38@xmath39",
    ", weak galactic winds can be seen even if @xmath40 . by the present epoch , roughly @xmath41 of the baryons",

    "the present values are summarized in table 3 .",

    "a ( solid lines , @xmath52 ) is the same as in k04 , where the feedback is stronger than the others because the star formation takes place at earlier epoch before the gas cloud collapses enough . with the model b ( dashed lines , @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the star formation takes place more slowly , and thus the stellar metallicity increases a lot . with the model c ( dotted lines , @xmath54 ) , which is adopted in the following sections as a standard model",
    ", the stellar yield is reduced with smaller @xmath26 , and thus the feedback is weaker than in the other models . here",
    "we define the galaxy as @xmath50 , i.e. , the region with the mean density higher than @xmath43 at each time .",
    "although the time evolution of the size and total mass ( panels a and b ) do not change at all , the stellar mass ( panel c ) varies with @xmath20 and @xmath26 by a factor of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , in the sense that stronger feedback decreases the stellar mass .",
    "the baryon fraction ( panel d ) is controlled by @xmath20 .",
    "although the dark matter contraction is independent of these parameters , @xmath20 changes the peak epoch of the initial starburst ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 gyr respectively for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , which determines when and where stars form in the contracting gas cloud . on the other hand , the present gas fraction ( panel e ) does not depend on @xmath20 , but on @xmath26",
    "this is because the return fraction is smaller with @xmath25 by a factor of @xmath61 than for @xmath62 depending on the lower mass limit @xmath63 of the imf ; 0.33 ( @xmath25 , @xmath64 , model c ) , 0.42 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , 0.45 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , model a ) , and 0.52 ( @xmath67 , @xmath66 , model b ) .",
    "how much gas turns to stars finally depends both on @xmath20 and @xmath26 because some fraction of the gas is ejected from the galaxy .",

    "we define the wind gas as the gas particles that have been inside @xmath50 and are outside @xmath51 at present .",
    "the wind gas mass is almost the half of the outside gas mass .",
    "although the temperature of the wind gas is different ( panels e , f ) , the ejected wind mass by the present is independent of these parameters ( panel d ) with an ejected wind fraction , the ratio of the wind mass to the accreted baryon mass @xmath69 , of @xmath0 .",
    "the wind efficiency , the ratio of the wind mass to the total stellar mass @xmath70 , depends on @xmath20 , and is @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this means that it is easier for gas particles to be blown away when the gas collapse has not yet finished .",

    "these are because the thermal feedback of supernovae is not enough to terminate star formation in the sph simulations .",
    "especially , ejection of the metal enriched gas do not work well .",
    "although the steep slope of the observational relation requires not only more metal ejection in less - massive galaxies , but also more metal production in massive galaxies , such process can not occur even if we change the imf (  [ sec : param ] ) .",
    "for the scatter , we find no significant dependence on merging history ; it is mainly caused by the age differences because the luminosity weighted metallicity is affected by bright young populations formed in the secondary starbursts .",
    "the relations for iron show larger scatter because iron is produced mainly by sne ia with longer lifetimes and affected by late star formation ( see  [ sec : discussion ] for the abundance ratios ) .",

    "we should note , however , that it may still be difficult to explain why [ o / fe ] is larger in more massive galaxies . the timescale and duration of star formation should be longer for massive galaxies because the deep dynamical potential keeps gas cooling .",

    "the merging histories are various with differences seeded in the initial conditions . in some cases , galaxies form through the assembly of gas rich small galaxies , and the process looks like a _ monolithic collapse_. in other cases , the final galaxies form through a _ major merger _ of preexisting galaxies .",

    "the colour - magnitude relation also shows a larger scatter because the star formation does not terminated completely in the simulations .",
    "an intrinsic scatter exists along the fundamental plane , and the origin of the scatter in the simulation lies in differences in merging history .",
    "galaxies that undergo major mergers tend to have larger effective radii and fainter surface brightnesses , which result in larger @xmath120 ( expressing masses ) , smaller @xmath121 ( surface brightnesses ) , and larger @xmath122 ( mass - to - light ratios ) .",
    "we examine the dependence of our results on the star formation parameter @xmath20 and the slope @xmath26 of the initial mass functions .",
    "although the time evolution of the size and total mass do not change at all , the stellar mass depends on these parameters in the sense that stronger feedback ( i.e. , larger @xmath20 and smaller @xmath26 ) decreases the stellar mass .",

    "the biggest effect of @xmath26 is on the metallicity , but it also changes the gas fraction and the residual gas mass in the galaxy .    on the other hand , the wind gas mass , which is defined as the gas particles that have been inside @xmath50 and are outside @xmath51 at present , does not depend on these parameters , and @xmath0 of the accreted baryons can be blown away .",
