    "the dynamics of discrete maps can be complicated , and various methods may be introduced to control their asymptotic behaviour . in addition , both the intrinsic dynamics and the control may involve stochasticity .    we may ask the following of stochastically perturbed difference equations :    1 .   if the original ( non - stochastic ) map has chaotic or unknown dynamics , can we stabilise the equation by introducing a control with a stochastic component ? 2 .",
    "if the non - stochastic equation is either stable or has known dynamics ( for example , a stable two - cycle @xcite ) , do those dynamics persist when a stochastic perturbation is introduced ?    in this article , we consider both these questions in the context of prediction - based control ( pbc , or predictive control ) .",
    "ushio and yamamoto @xcite introduced pbc as a method of stabilising unstable periodic orbits of @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the method overcomes some of the limitations of delayed feedback control ( introduced by pyragas  @xcite ) , and does not require the a priori approximation of periodic orbits , as does the ogy method developed by ott et al  @xcite .",
    "the general form of pbc is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the @xmath7th iteration of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 , pbc becomes @xmath10    recently , it has been shown how pbc can be used to manage population size via population reduction by ensuring that the positive equilibrium of a class of one - dimensional maps commonly used to model population dynamics is globally asymptotically stable after the application of the control  @xcite .",
    "similar effects are also possible if it is not feasible to apply the control at every timestep .",
    "this variation on the technique is referred to as pbc - based pulse stabilisation  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we investigate the influence of stochastic perturbations on the ability of pbc to induce global asymptotic stability of a positive point equilibrium of a class of equations of the form .",
    "it is reasonable to introduce noise in one of two ways .",
    "first , the implementation of pbc relies upon a controlling agent to change the state of the system in a way characterised by the value of the control parameter @xmath11 . in reality",
    "we expect that such precise control is impossible , and the actual change will be characterised by a control sequence @xmath12 with terms that vary randomly around @xmath11 with some distribution .",
    "this will lead to a state - dependent , or multiplicative , stochastic perturbation .",
    "second , the system itself may be subject to extrinsic noise , which may be modelled by a state - independent , or additive , perturbation .",
    "the fact that stochastic perturbation can stabilise an unstable equilibrium has been understood since the 1950s : consider the well - known example of the pendulum of kapica @xcite .",
    "more recently , a general theory of stochastic stabilisation and destabilisation of ordinary differential equations has developed from @xcite : a comprehensive review of the literature is presented in @xcite .",
    "this theory extends to functional differential equations : for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "stochastic stabilisation and destabilisation is also possible for difference equations ; see for example @xcite .",
    "however , the qualitative behaviour of stochastic difference equations may be dramatically different from that seen in the continuous - time case , and must be investigated separately .",
    "for example , in @xcite , solutions of a nonlinear stochastic difference equation with multiplicative noise arising from an euler discretisation of an it - type sde are shown to demonstrate monotonic convergence to a point equilibrium with high probability .",
    "this behaviour is not possible in the continuous - time limit .",
    "now , consider the structure of the map @xmath8 .",
    "we impose the lipschitz - type assumption on the function @xmath8 around the unique positive equilibrium @xmath13 .",
    "[ as : slope ] @xmath14 is a continuous function , @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and there exists @xmath21 such that @xmath22 function @xmath8 has only a single positive point equilibrium @xmath13 .",
    "we will also suppose that @xmath8 is decreasing on an interval that includes @xmath13 :    [ as:3 ] there is a point @xmath23 such that @xmath24 is monotone decreasing on @xmath25 .",
    "it is quite common for assumptions  [ as : slope ] and [ as:3 ] to hold for models of population dynamics , and in particular for models characterised by a unimodal map : we illustrate this with examples [ ex : ric]-[ex : bh ] .",
    "it follows from singer  @xcite that , when additionally @xmath8 has a negative schwarzian derivative @xmath26 , the equilibrium @xmath13 is globally asymptotically stable if and only if it is locally asymptotically stable . in each case , as the system parameter grows , a stable cycle replaces a stable equilibrium which loses its stability , there are period - doubling bifurcations and eventually chaotic behaviour .",
    "[ ex : ric ] for the ricker model @xmath27 assumptions  [ as : slope ] and [ as:3 ] both hold with @xmath28 , and the global maximum is attained at @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "let us note that for @xmath31 the positive equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the convergence of solutions to @xmath13 is monotone .",
    "however , for @xmath32 the equilibrium becomes unstable .",
    "[ ex : log ] the truncated logistic model @xmath33 with @xmath30 and @xmath34 , also satisfies assumptions  [ as : slope ] and [ as:3 ] .",
    "again , for @xmath35 , the equilibrium @xmath13 is globally asymptotically stable , with monotone convergence to @xmath13 , while for @xmath36 the equilibrium @xmath13 is unstable .",
    "[ ex : bh ] for the modifications of the beverton - holt equation @xmath37 and @xmath38 assumption  [ as : slope ] holds .",
    "also , and satisfy assumption  [ as:3 ] as long as the point at which the map on the right - hand side takes its maximum value is less than that of the point equilibrium . if assumption  [ as:3 ] is not satisfied , the function is monotone increasing up to the unique positive point equilibrium , and thus all solutions converge to the positive equilibrium , and the convergence is monotone .",
    "if all @xmath39 , we have a monotonically decreasing sequence .",
    "if we fix @xmath40 in and and consider the growing @xmath41 , the equation loses stability and experiences transition to chaos through a series of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "the article has the following structure . in section 2",
    "we relax the control parameter @xmath11 , replacing it with the variable control sequence @xmath12 , and yielding the equation @xmath42 we identify a range over which @xmath12 may vary deterministically while still ensuring the global asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium @xmath13 .",
    "we confirm that , without imposing any constraints on the range of values over which the control sequence @xmath12 may vary , there exists an invariant interval , containing @xmath13 , under the controlled map .",
    "we then introduce constraints on terms of the sequence @xmath12 which ensure that all solutions will eventually enter this invariant interval .    in section 3 ,",
    "we assume that the variation of @xmath43 around @xmath11 is bounded and stochastic , which results in a pbc equation with multiplicative noise of intensity @xmath44 . after identifying constraints on @xmath11 and @xmath44 under which a domain of local stability for @xmath13 exists for all trajectories ,",
    "we demonstrate that the presence of an appropriate noise perturbation in fact ensures that almost all trajectories will eventually enter this domain of local stability , hence providing global a.s .",
    "asymptotic stabilisation of @xmath13 .",
    "the known range of values of @xmath11 under which this stabilisation occurs is larger than for the deterministic pbc equation , and in this sense the stochastic perturbation improves the stabilising properties of pbc .    in section 4 , we suppose that the noise is acting systemically rather than through the control parameter , which results in a pbc equation with an additive noise . in this setting",
    "it is possible to show that , under certain conditions on the noise intensity @xmath44 , the noise causes a `` blurring '' of the positive equilibrium @xmath13 in the sense that the controlled solutions will enter and remain within a neighbourhood of @xmath13 , and the size of that neighbourhood can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of @xmath44 .",
    "finally , section 5 contains some simulations that illustrate the results of the article , and a brief summary .",
    "we begin by relaxing the control variable in the deterministic pbc equation , both as a generalisation to equations of form and to support our analysis of the system with stochastically varying control in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "deterministic pbc equation with variable control parameter may be written in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46    the following result extends ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.2 ) to develop conditions on the magnitude of variation of @xmath43 for solutions of to approach the positive equilbrium @xmath13 at some minimum rate .",
