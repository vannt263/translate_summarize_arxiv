    "electronic transport through molecular wire has been studied intensively theoretically as well as numerically in recent years @xcite . a molecular wires consists of a molecule which",
    "is coupled to two leads acting as electron source and drain .",
    "depending on the bias voltage applied across the wire there will be a charge flow through the wire which might consist of a single molecule only .",
    "most electron transport experiments are described by the scattering approach put forward by landauer @xcite .",
    "another class of theories of quantum transport utilizes the non - equilibrium green s function approach @xcite .",
    "this formalism has the advantage of being formally exact within the lead - wire coupling but the dependence of green s functions on two time arguments makes it rather difficult to calculate the quantities involved .",
    "if one treats the lead - wire coupling perturbatively one can derive quantum master equations for the electron dynamics in the wire and the current through the wire which can be treated in the standard fashion for master equations @xcite . this kind of quantum master equations is usually used to study the dynamics of a system coupled to a thermal bath @xcite .",
    "often these theories are based on a second - order perturbation theory in the system - bath coupling and sometime together with the neglect of memory effects ( markov approximation ) . in the present contribution we will use this formalism for the coupling of the wire to fermionic reservoirs @xcite .",
    "we make use of the spectral decomposition of the spectral density @xmath0 first introduced by meier and tannor @xcite .",
    "initially this formalism was applied within the time - nonlocal approach based on the nakajima - zwanzig equation .",
    "afterwards the same methods was used for master equations based on a time - local formalism @xcite . for molecular wires these two versions of quantum master equations have been compared recently@xcite .",
    "in addition to the coupling to fermionic reservoirs , the relevant system , i.e.  the wire , is coupled to a laser field .",
    "first experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies in this direction have been performed . on the theoretical side most of these studies",
    "are based on a perturbative treatment in the environmental coupling this allows for an easy inclusion of time - dependent laser fields . for time - periodic laser fields",
    "the floquet formalism can be employed @xcite while for arbitrary time - dependent laser fields the present authors derived a formalism which treats the laser - wire interaction exactly @xcite .",
    "this approach employs the above described spectral decomposition of the spectral density .    in previous publications",
    "@xcite it was shown that the current through the molecular wire can be suppressed using the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) .",
    "this effect was first studied by grossmann et al.@xcite showing that the tunneling dynamics in a periodically driven quantum system can be quenched . at a fixed frequency of the laser",
    "the cdt occurs for certain amplitudes of the laser field . in the case of periodic laser fields",
    "the cdt can be studied using the floquet theory @xcite . in a recent study @xcite we showed that the cdt can also be observed for rather short laser pulses . in the case of a cw - laser field one",
    "has to average the current over one period of the carrier frequency to see the complete suppression of the current . for short laser pulses",
    "the current has to be averaged over several periods . in ref .",
    "@xcite three periods were employed for this purpose , here we take five periods . in the current contribution",
    "we want to extend the previous study by including spin to be able to study on - site electron correlation .",
    "furthermore we study the effects of the laser pulse on a system with one site only . throughout the paper @xmath1 and the boltzmann constant @xmath2",
    "are set to unity .",
    "and @xmath3 and at the same time to a thermal bath .",
    "the coupling of the sites to each other is described by the hopping element @xmath4 and to the corresponding lead by the spectral density function @xmath5 .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath6 of the wire can be manipulated with a time - dependent external electric field @xmath7.,width=207 ]    to study the effects mentioned in the introduction we use a system consisting of two parts : the relevant system @xmath8 , mimicking the wire , and the reservoirs @xmath9 modeling the leads .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 with the wire - lead coupling @xmath11 .",
    "the wire consists of @xmath12 sites coupled to each other by a hopping element @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ f.0 ] ) .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of electrons at site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , so that the tight - binding description of the the molecular wire reads @xmath17 in the first term we assumed the on - site energies @xmath6 to be spin - independent .",
    "the second term describes the nearest - neighbor hopping of electrons with the same spin and the third term the on - site electron interaction within the wire .",
    "the laser - wire interaction is given by the last term and for the dipole operator we assume @xcite @xmath18 for wires with more than one site and a constant for a wire consisting of only one site .    the two electronic leads that are modeled by two independent reservoirs of uncorrelated electrons in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in the derivations below only the left lead will be considered but the formalism has to be applied to the right lead as well . denoting the creation and annihilation operators of an electron in the reservoir modes @xmath19 with spin @xmath14 by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , the coupling of the left lead to first site of the wire is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and a wire - lead coupling strength @xmath25    as one is normally not interested in the dynamics within the leads but only within the wire , a quantum master equation ( qme ) based on a second - order perturbation theory in the wire - lead coupling has been developed for the reduced density matrix of the wire @xmath26 @xcite @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the corresponding auxiliary operators for the wire - lead coupling @xmath28 here we employed the definitions @xmath29 and assumed the reservoir correlation functions @xmath30 with the reservoir density matrix @xmath31 to be spin - independent . using this form has the advantages over the redfield approach @xcite that the memory terms are included and that the wire - laser coupling is treated exactly within the dipole approximation .    in the system - bath approach",
    "used the coupling to the fermionic reservoirs is described by a single quantity , namely the spectral density @xmath32 . in principle this coupling can be different for the right and the left lead but we assume it to be equal for both cases . for a dense spectrum of reservoirs the sum becomes a smooth function . to be able to use the theorem of residues to determine the bath correlation functions ,",
    "one approximates the spectral density by a numerical decomposition into lorentzian functions @xcite @xmath33 with real fitting parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore one uses the fact that @xmath37 for @xmath38 which is fulfilled for a wide range of parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 . with the roots of @xmath39 and ( [ equ : spectralnum ] ) , the application of the theorem of residues results in @xmath40 with the abbreviations @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the matsubara frequencies @xmath43 .",
    "rigorously , the sum over the matsubara frequencies would be infinite but it can be truncated at a finite @xmath44 depending on the temperature of the system @xmath45 and the spectral width of @xmath5 .",
    "the pure exponential dependence of the correlation function on time allows one to derive a set of differential equations for the auxiliary density operators @xmath46 + \\gamma_{xx'}^k \\lambda_{xx'\\sigma}^k(t ) , \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}{\\widehat\\lambda}_{xx'\\sigma}^k(t)&=&\\left(a_{x'x}^k\\right)^\\ast \\rho_s(t ) k_{x'\\sigma }    -i [ h_s(t ) , \\widehat \\lambda_{xx'\\sigma}^k(t ) ] + \\left(\\gamma_{x'x}^k \\right)^\\ast \\widehat \\lambda_{xx'\\sigma}^k(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "in this section results are shown for a wire consisting either of one or two sites .",
    "the parameters for both cases are the same .",
    "the energy scale used is the tight - binding hopping parameter @xmath4 which is set to 0.1 ev . for the case of one site this is of course an artificial parameter since it does not play a role in this particular system .",
    "nevertheless we use this energy scale since it is used in other work as well .",
    "the temperature is set to @xmath51 k. for simplicity a simple spectral density is used which consists only of one lorentzian in eq .",
    "( [ equ : spectralnum ] ) .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be @xmath52=50 ev , @xmath53=50 ev , and @xmath54=5 ev which results in a maximum coupling strength between wire and leads of @xmath55  @xmath4 .",
    "for these parameters the condition @xmath37 for @xmath38 is nicely fulfilled .",
    "the site energies are @xmath56 ev and therefore located at the maximum of the coupling to the leads .",
    "the fermi energies are set to @xmath57 ev @xmath58 ev leading to a bias voltage of 0.4 ev .",
    "the laser pulse used in all calculations has a gaussian shape @xmath59 with @xmath60 fs , @xmath45= 400 fs and a maximum amplitude of @xmath61 ev .",
    "this amplitude corresponds to a full cdt @xcite .",
    "the carrier frequency is set to 1  ev . with the chosen energy settings , a time unit in the system corresponds to 0.66 fs . using eq .",
    "( [ equ : finalcurrent ] ) the current unit can be extracted to be @xmath62  a .",
    "[ f.2 ] in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] the current and the averaged current are shown together with the laser field .",
    "the amplitude @xmath61 ev of the laser field is chosen such that the cdt condition is fulfilled .",
    "the cdt condition was originally developed for cw laser fields but as already shown earlier in the case of spinless electrons @xcite is also important for short laser pulses . in the case of no electron correlation as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] no big difference can be seen compared to the case of spinless electrons .",
    "for very short times one can see the loading of the initially empty wire sites , then an equilibration before the laser pulse sets in . at the maximum of the laser field",
    "the average current is completely suppressed .",
    "interestingly fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] shows a wire consisting only of one site and a constant dipole moment .",
    "so the laser suppresses the transport between the site and the leads which are directly coupled to it .",
    "earlier studies always used wires of at least two sites and in those studies it was not clear if the laser blocks the current between the sites of the wire or between the wire and the leads .",
    "the present study clearly shows that the cdt also works to suppress the current between the wire and the leads .    .",
    "in the graph displaying the populations the upper four curves correspond to the population of the spin up orbital which is identical to the population of the spin down orbital .",
    "the lower four curves show the probability of a double occupancy of the site .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] . in the graph displaying the populations the upper four curves correspond to the population of the spin up orbital which is identical to the population of the spin down orbital .",
    "the lower four curves show the probability of a double occupancy of the site . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=185 ]    fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] shows the occupation probabilities and average current for different values of the electron interaction @xmath63 .",
    "shown are the probabilities of finding a spin - up electron @xmath64 which is equal to that of finding a spin - down electron .",
    "in addition the probability of a doubly occupied site displayed .",
    "while increasing the electron interaction @xmath65 from 0 to 5 the probability for a doubly occupied site decreased as expected .",
    "the probability to find a spin - up or -down electron on the site decreases at the same time since this contains also the probability for double occupancy .",
    "interestingly enough , the laser pulse allows for a doubly occupied site to an amount which is also seen without electron correlation .",
    "so during the maximum of the laser pulse the double occupancy is the same irrespective of electron interaction .",
    "therefor the energy barrier created by electron interaction is , in a sense , overcome by the energy of the laser pulse .",
    "so it is not astonishingly that the current through the wire is the same during the maximum of the laser pulse .",
    "but since at that moment in time the cdt condition is fulfilled , the current is zero independent of electron correlation .",
    "the equilibrium current without laser pulse is smaller in the case of electron interaction since the energy of the doubly occupied state is moved above the fermi level due to correlation .",
    "so this level can not participate in the current when the laser is off .",
    "the case of a wire with two sites is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] . again",
    "the occupation probabilities of the different orbitals are shown .",
    "this time the dipole operator is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and so the population on the two sites is different .",
    "also in this case the probability of doubly occupied sites decreases with electron interaction but can be increased or decreased by the laser pulse which only shifts the site energies .",
    "the current suppression through the phenomenon of cdt looks very similar to that of a one - site wire or that of spinless electrons @xcite .",
    "in the present contribution we extended our earlier work @xcite by including spin to be able to treat on - site interaction and by investigating the case of a wire with only one site .",
    "again it could be shown that the phenomenon of cdt exists in models of molecular wires also for short laser pulses and not only for monochromatic laser fields . the amplitude condition as for cw - laser fields plays an important role but has to be investigated further . as shown earlier @xcite",
    "longer pulses suppress the current more effectively so it might be possible to find a better modified cdt condition for short gaussian laser pulses or to find more effective pulse forms .",
    "the on - site interaction between the electrons does not effect the effect of current suppression which can be understood , at least partially , by looking at the occupation probabilities and the effect of the laser pulse on them .",
    "the employed model of a molecular wire is of course rather simplistic .",
    "higher excited states should be taken into account and also dephasing effects .",
    "the dephasing effects can be studied by coupling the wire to an additional thermal bath in the same spirit than the coupling to the electron reservoirs .",
    "this will be done in the future to investigate how quickly the coherent effect of cdt gets washed out . for cw - laser fields that has been studied within the floquet approach @xcite .",
    "it is unclear in how far short laser pulses might work better than cw - laser fields because they do contain a range of amplitudes and so some of the amplitudes might still fulfill a modified cdt criterion under the influence of a thermal bath ."
