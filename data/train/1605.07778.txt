    "the nuclear reaction of unstable nuclei is of high interest in the contemporary fundamental physics as well as applied nuclear physics .",
    "the corresponding information from experimental data is always too sparse or totally lacking .",
    "therefore , during the past few decades , considerable effort has been made to explore the nuclear reaction based on a fundamental microscopic nuclear theory so as to obtain more reliable prediction .",
    "the optical model is the crucial component in the nuclear reaction study , mainly because it determines the cross section for nuclear scattering and compound nuclear formation in the initial stage of a reaction and supplies the transmission coefficients for branching into the various final states @xcite .",
    "many observables such as the elastic scattering angular distribution , analyzing power , spin rotation function and so on can be derived through the optical model . therefore , the most important criteria to assess a microscopic optical potential ( mop ) is that it can reproduce the existing experimental data of these observables as accurate as possible , and make a reliable prediction without experimental guidance .",
    "furthermore , the mop is more appealing when it is established on better theoretical grounds with a small number of free parameters .    in the direct evaluation for mop of finite nuclei",
    "an attempt is made to evaluate the scattering and absorption processes using a many - body theory for the target nuclei which goes beyond mean field theory and incorporates e.g. the effects of particle - vibration couplings .",
    "these studies typically employ an effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interaction ( e.g. skyrme interaction or gogny interaction ) . recently ,",
    "several investigations for finite nuclei have been reported @xcite , however , it seems still infeasible to derive the mop for all nuclei , which are of interest e.g. in the field of applications of nuclear physics .",
    "in addition the specification of a sound nuclear structure for targets , especially for exotic nuclei remains to be progressed .",
    "using phenomenological @xmath9 interactions such calculations are designed to derive the nuclear structure and the mop from the same interaction model .",
    "a drawback of this scheme is phenomenological and fitted to describe these data .    on the other hand",
    ", various attempts have been made to derive the mop from a realistic model of the @xmath9 interaction , which means an interaction designed and fitted to describe the @xmath9 scattering data .",
    "such studies often use the system of nuclear matter to determine the effects of correlations and evaluate the medium dependence of the resulting effective interaction for nuclear matter .",
    "the nuclear matter results are then used in various kinds of local density approximation ( lda ) to be applicable for finite nuclei .",
    "the review article of ray et al . discusses various approximation schemes along this line @xcite .",
    "pioneering work along this line has been presented by mahaux and coworkers @xcite who evaluated the nucleon self - energy in nuclear matter as a function of density and energy in a brueckner hartree fock ( bhf ) approximation and identified the resulting complex single - particle potential with the mop for finite nuclei using lda adopting nucleon density distributions from the empirical formula or microscopic nuclear structure calculations .",
    "one drawback of this scheme is that typically one has to use an interaction model for the evaluation of the density profile of the nuclei which is different from the realistic interaction used to calculate the self - energy in nuclear matter as bhf calculations fail to reproduce the empirical saturation properties for nuclear matter and finite nuclei . in a simplified way",
    ", some mops have been developed by adopting the effective @xmath9 interactions ( e.g. skyrme force ) in the hartree - fock approach in nuclear matter and lda for finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "another handicap of this approach is the fact that this approach only provides the central part of the mop , the spin - orbit potential has to be adjusted independently from the central potential in such a non - relativistic approach .",
    "nevertheless this scheme has been applied with quite some success by jeukenne , lejeune and mahaux already in the 1970s @xcite and is still rather popular today .",
    "also the so - called @xmath10-folding method developed by amos et al .",
    "@xcite is based on a realistic @xmath9 interaction and uses a local density approximation to account for the medium dependence of the effective interaction . in this case , however , it is the @xmath9 interaction , which is evaluated by solving the bethe - goldstone equation in nuclear matter and then employed in a folding calculation to evaluate the mop for finite nuclei .",
    "the @xmath10-folding approach has very successfully been applied to reproduce differential cross sections and spin observables in an energy range from 30 mev to 300 mev in several nuclei without any adjustment of parameters @xcite .",
    "the mahaux scheme as well as the `` g''-folding method are based on a non - relativistic approach and the energy - dependence of the mop originates from the energy - dependence of the effective interaction @xmath10 calculated for nuclear matter in the bhf approximation .",
    "an alternative approach is based on the dirac phenomenology as it has been introduced by walecka and coworkers @xcite . within this dirac phenomenology",
    "the nucleon self - energy contains a large and attractive component , which transforms like a scalar under a lorentz transformation compensated to a large extent by a repulsive lorentz vector component . if one reduces the corresponding dirac equation for the nucleon in the nuclear matter medium to a non - relativistic schrdinger equation , one obtains a schrdinger equivalent potential with a central potential which is energy dependent and a strong spin - orbit term .",
    "an application of this dirac phenomenology to describe the optical model potential has been presented by cooper et al .",
    "they developed a phenomenological parametrization of the real and imaginary parts of the scalar and vector potentials .",
    "fitting the corresponding parameters , which depend on energy and mass number of the target nucleus , they obtain a very good global fit of the optical model potential .",
    "a comparison of the rather successful but very different approaches to a global optical potential , the @xmath10-folding method and dirac phenomenology , has been made by deb et al .",
    "they evaluated differential cross sections and spin observables for nucleon nucleus scattering on five different targets ranging from @xmath3c to @xmath4pb at energies of 65 and 200 mev using both approaches and conclude that the results are of similar quality .",
    "it is one aim of the dirac brueckner hartree fock ( dbhf ) approach , to combine the features of a realistic @xmath9 interaction and its dependence on the medium , as they are contained in the mahaux approach and the `` g''-folding model with those of the dirac phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this approach is founded on a realistic @xmath9 interaction and the treatment of nuclear correlations and the medium dependence of the effective @xmath9 interaction is done in straight analogy to the mahaux approach and the @xmath10-folding method .",
    "the dbhf approach , however , keeps track of the relativistic structure of the nucleon self - energy and therefore one can determine the real and imaginary part of the scalar and vector component of the nucleon self - energy in nuclear matter as a function of momentum , density and energy .",
    "these components are then used to evaluate the corresponding mop using lda for these components of the self - energy in straight analogy to the mahaux scheme .    in this way , the spin - orbit potential arises naturally from the coherent sum of the contribution from the scalar and vector potentials in this relativistic scheme , and the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter are reproduced in the relativistic dirac brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach , while three - nucleon forces have to be introduced to obtain a corresponding result within the non - relativistic bhf approximation @xcite",
    ". therefore it seems rather attractive to determine a microscopic optical model based on the dbhf approach as finally one may be able to describe the ground - state properties of nuclei and the mop within the same theoretical framework .    for a long period",
    "it has been a challenge in theoretical nuclear physics to solve the brueckner - hartree - fock in the relativistic way , especially for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter . in recent years substantial progress has been obtained using a so - called subtracted t - matrix ( stm ) representation in the projection technique to solve dbhf strictly in the symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .    in a preliminary study",
    "we have explored the isospin dependent relativistic microscopic optical potential adopting the self - energies from this dbhf calculation in @xcite .",
    "this mop has been verified by satisfactorily reproducing the neutron and proton scattering data from @xmath11al . in this work , a systematic investigation for this mop is performed in a large range of nuclei .",
    "the microscopic radial nucleon density of finite nuclei based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation are adopted in this calculation instead of the previous empirical values . meanwhile , a @xmath0 assessment system based on the global simulated annealing algorithm ( gsa ) is specially designed to optimize the free factors and give an overall estimation on the performance of this mop .",
    "the paper is composed as follows . in section",
    "ii , the general formalism of dbhf is briefly introduced .",
    "the isospin dependent relativistic mop of finite nuclei are built in section iii through combining the self - energies and the microscopic radial nucleon density by the improved local density approximation ( ilda ) @xcite .",
    "the global analysis of nuclear scattering is carried out in section iv for neutron and proton scattering and induced reactions on @xmath3c - @xmath4pb and the calculated results are compared with the calculated results with the widely - used phenomenological koning - delaroche ( kd ) global optical potential @xcite and the experimental data of various scattering quantities .",
    "finally , the overall discussion is summarized in section v.",
    "realistic @xmath9 interactions contain strong short - range and tensor components .",
    "therefore it is necessary to account for the corresponding correlations between the interacting nucleons . in the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock approach",
    "this is achieved by considering the equation for two interacting nucleons in nuclear matter .",
    "this leads to the ladder approximation of the relativistic bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nucleon - nucleon interaction matrix in the nuclear medium and @xmath14 is the bare @xmath9 interaction , respectively .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is included by the @xmath15 operator and the in - medium nucleon propagation of the nucleons is described by the green s function @xmath16 , which fulfills the dyson equation , @xmath17 @xmath18 denotes the free nucleon propagator , and the self - energy term @xmath19 is defined in first order of the effective interaction @xmath13 through the following standard hartree - fock equation @xmath20-gt ) .",
    "\\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note the self - energy contains the direct and exchange terms at the same time , and that the momentum integration considers all nucleon states within the fermi sea represented by f in eq .",
    "because eqs . [ eq1]-[eq3 ] are strongly coupled , they have to be solved iteratively until convergence is reached .",
    "generally , the lorentz structure of the relativistic self - energy @xmath19 can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath21 in this equation , @xmath22 is the scalar part of self - energy , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the time - like and space - like terms of the vector part , respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath25 is used to sign the proton and neutron since they should be distinguished in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "note that these components of the self - energy are functions of the nucleon momentum ( @xmath26 ) , density or fermi momentum ( @xmath27 ) , and asymmetry parameter @xmath8 = ( @xmath28-@xmath29)/@xmath30 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 indicate the neutron , proton and total densities in nuclear matter , respectively .    details of such dbhf calculations and the method to extract these dirac components using the subtracted t - matrix ( stm ) representation are described in @xcite .",
    "the self - energies used in the present study are determined using the bonn - b potential @xcite for the bare @xmath9 interaction and solving the dbhf equations for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter with various densities and isospin asymmetries .",

    "we adopt the radial nucleon density , @xmath52 , from the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach with gogny d1s force @xcite , instead of the empirical values by the negele s formula @xcite , which has been employed for our pilot study @xcite .    in fig .",

    "this neutron skin leads to large isospin asymmetries as presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "in addition , as for this microscopic optical potential , the applicability of the theory should be indicated that the formalism does not include the coupling to giant resonances ( 10 mev to 30 mev ) and the compound nucleus formation ( @xmath59 10 mev ) , which has been discussed before and stressed in e.g. @xcite . at the low energies , we include the compound nuclear contribution to the elastic differential cross sections by the hauser - feshbach statistic theory through the optical model code apmn @xcite , which employs the hauser - feshbach model to determine the contributions from the compound nuclear elastic scattering by concerning six competing single - particle emission reactions , including neutron , proton , deuteron , tritium , @xmath60 , and @xmath61he .",
    "the formation of giant resonances will further discussed in other future work .",
    "it is the aim of this work to generate an optical potential , which has a microscopic basis and reproduces bulk features of nucleon - nucleus scattering for nuclei across the whole nuclide chart .",
    "the microscopic basis of these calculations originates from the real and imaginary parts of the dirac components , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , of the nucleon self - energies calculated in the dbhf approach for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "such dbhf calculations , however , yield reliable results only for densities @xmath62 0.08 @xmath63",
    ". the procedure to derive self - consistent dbhf results does typically not converge at lower densities .",
    "this reflects the situation that homogeneous nuclear matter is unstable at such low densities with respect to the formation of an inhomogeneous density profile containing nuclear clusters .",
    "in particular the solution of the @xmath13-matrix of eq . [ eq1 ] yields bound states in the deuteron channel .",
    "for the derivation of the optical model potential for finite nuclei , however , we also need results at densities @xmath64 0.08 @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we have to extrapolate the results to these low densities with the natural constraint that the dirac potentials @xmath33 and @xmath34 vanish at @xmath65 a linear interpolation of these dirac potentials between @xmath66 0.08 @xmath63 and @xmath30 = 0 might be too simple .",
    "therefore we have introduced auxiliary mesh - points at @xmath66 0.04 @xmath63 for the real parts and at @xmath66 0.04 and 0.06 @xmath63 for the imaginary parts .",
    "the values of the linear interpolation at these auxiliary mesh - points is then enhanced by a factor @xmath67 for the real part and a factor @xmath68 for the imaginary part .",
    "typical value for these enhancement factors ( @xmath69 ) are ( 0.86 , 1.14 ) ( see description of fitting procedure below ) .    since the evaluation of the spin - orbit and darwin potential ( see eq .",
    "[ eq15 ] ) requires the calculation of derivatives of the dirac potentials with respect to their density dependence , it is favorable to determine a simple interpolation scheme , which is valid for all densities entering into the calculation .",
    "therefore we have chosen to represent the density - dependence of the dirac potentials in terms of a polynomial fit with a polynom of degree 5 for the real part and a polynom of degree 7 for the imaginary part .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomials are determined to fit the results at all calculated densities , including the auxiliary mesh points mentioned above .    as an example we present in fig .",

    "more details about this system will be introduced later in this section .      as mentioned above ,",
    "one of the main criteria to evaluate a good optical model potential is that it can well reproduce as many of the measured scattering observables as possible .",
    "thus , how to optimize the present microscopic potentials to predict the available experimental data sets is an important issue .",
    "optimization procedures have widely been discussed in the literature of the optical model @xcite .",
    "most of them obtain the parameters through minimizing a certain @xmath0 value , given for example by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the @xmath75th experimental point , @xmath76 is the corresponding calculated result , and @xmath77 indicates the total number of experimental data in our consideration . in this study , the effective range factor @xmath7 related to the schrdinger equivalent potentials in eq .",

    "we employ the global simulated annealing ( gsa ) method based on the monte carlo sampling in a predefined region of the free parameters .",

    "@xmath0 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq12 ] , and @xmath79 is the number of degrees of freedom with the total number of experimental data @xmath77 and the number of free parameters @xmath80 .",
    "it is known , however , that it is not possible to obtain a best - fit through the numerical optimization procedure @xcite alone , therefore a visual goodness - of - fit estimation evaluator is also incorporated in our optimization procedure .",
    "observables including the angular distribution ( d@xmath81/d@xmath82 ) , analyzing power ( a@xmath83 ) for nucleon - nucleus elastic scattering as well as the neutron total cross section ( @xmath84 ) and proton total reaction cross section ( @xmath85 ) et al .",

    "after the minimal @xmath0/@xmath78 value is achieved for d@xmath81/d@xmath82 , the other observables are then utilized in the visual goodness estimation for a further improvement of the mop .",
    "@xmath86ca and @xmath4pb , for which a large number of experimental data of proton and neutron scattering were measured , are both double magic nuclei and they represent proper examples to cover a good range from isospin symmetric to asymmetric nuclei , therefore , they were selected in our mop optimization procedure .",
    "moreover , after optimizing the mop using these data , we further test the potentials by predicting scattering observables of other nuclei . as a result ,",
    "our optimization procedure for proton scattering yields a value of @xmath7 = 1.35 fm with the value @xmath87 of 0.29 , which is a pretty good result in view of the 1028 points of d@xmath81/d@xmath82 in 18 different experimental data sets .",
    "similarly , we get an optimized @xmath7 = 1.45 fm for neutron scattering reactions .",
    "these values are comparable to the range parameter @xmath7 = 1.4 fm , which has been derived in our pilot study @xcite focused on the target nucleus @xmath11al .",

    "the experimental data adopted in our analysis are all referred in this library .",
    "the details of measured elastic scattering angular distribution are specified in this paper by the first author and published time , which are shown in table [ tab1]-[tab2 ] for neutron induced reaction and table [ tab6 ] for proton incident reaction according to the diversified target nuclei .",
    "other measurements like neutron total cross section and proton reaction cross section are also depicted in the same way in figures .",
    "about 500 sets of elastic scattering angular distributions , 30 sets of analyzing power angular distributions , and 20 sets of total neutron cross sections for 32 different targets are involved in this systematic comparison .",
    "the present calculations are compared with experimental data and the results from the widely - used koning - delaroche ( kd ) optical potential .    because nucleon densities of very light nuclei are not described in a reliable way by means of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach , we take @xmath3c as the lightest target in this study .",
    "overall , the predictions of the mop are in rather good agreement with the experimental data as well as the results calculated by kd potential for such large mass and energy ranges .",

    "after adjustment of very few parameters , the new optical potential reproduces many nucleon scattering data for target nuclei across the whole nuclear mass table of stable isotopes between @xmath3c to @xmath4pb at nucleon incident energies from 1 mev to 200 mev .",
    "the hope is that this approach for a microscopic optical potential yields reliable predictions also for unstable target nuclei , since an extrapolation in this unstable region should be more reliable than a pure phenomenological fit with more fit parameter .",

    "the complex isospin dependent self - energies are extracted from the dbhf approach with projection techniques using the bonn - b bare @xmath9 interaction . the mop with bonn",
    "a has also been tested and the results show that the prediction of the scattering for finite nuclei is not very sensitive to the choice of a realistic nucleon force , bonn a or bonn b. therefore , bonn - b has been adopted following our pilot study @xcite .",
    "the present mop is very strictly built on the dbhf calculations in nuclear matter at @xmath89 @xmath63 by means of the improved local density approximation .",
    "for the purpose of describing the observables of scattering , we construct the optimization method according to the annealing algorithm .",

    "good predictions for most nuclei are achieved by the resulting mop only with the free parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the results of the mop are of a quality , which is comparable to the widely used phenomenological koning - delaroche ( kd ) global potential .",

    "<S> * background : * for the study of exotic nuclei it is important to have an optical model potential , which is reliable not only for stable nuclei but can also be extrapolated to nuclear systems with exotic numbers of protons and neutrons . an effective way to obtain such </S>",
    "<S> a potential is to develop a microscopic optical potential ( mop ) based on a fundamental theory with a minimal number of free parameters , which are adjusted to describe stable nuclei all over the nuclide chart .    </S>",
    "<S> * purpose : * the choice adopted in the present work is to develop the mop within a relativistic scheme which provides a natural and consistent relation between the spin - orbit part and the central part of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach provides such a microscopic relativistic scheme , which is based on a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction and reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter without any adjustable parameter . </S>",
    "<S> its solution using the projection technique within the subtracted t - matrix ( stm ) representation provides a reliable extension to asymmetric nuclear matter , which is important to describe the features of the isospin asymmetric nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the present work aims to perform a global analysis of the isospin - dependent nucleon - nucleus mop based on the dbhf calculation in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter .    </S>",
    "<S> * methods : * the dbhf is used to evaluate the relativistic structure of the nucleon self - energies in nuclear matter at various densities and asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equivalent potentials of finite nuclei are derived from these dirac components by a local density approximation ( lda ) . </S>",
    "<S> the density distributions of finite nuclei are taken from the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach with gogny d1s force . </S>",
    "<S> an improved lda approach ( ilda ) is employed to get a better prediction of the scattering observables . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0 assessment system based on the global simulated annealing algorithm ( gsa ) is developed to optimize the very few free components in this study .    </S>",
    "<S> * results : * the nucleon - nucleus scattering calculations are carried out for a broad spectrum @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering experiments below 200 mev with targets ranging from @xmath3c to @xmath4pb . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering observables including the neutron total cross section , proton reaction cross section , elastic scattering angular distribution , analyzing power and spin rotation are evaluated and compared with the experimental data , as well as with results derived from the widely used phenomenological koning - delaroche ( kd ) global potential .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions : * results with the present relativistic mop satisfactorily reproduce the @xmath5 + @xmath6 scattering observables over a broad mass range and a large energy region only with the free range factor @xmath7 in ilda and minor adjustment to the scalar and vector potentials around the low density region , and the relevant potentials are physically well - behaved . </S>",
    "<S> the overall agreement indicates that the present mop may have predictive power for unstable nuclei , as well as the nuclei beyond the line of @xmath8 stability .    </S>"
