    "this indicates that small - scale particle accelerations frequently take place in the corona .",
    "based on the magnetic reconnection scenario @xcite , many authors have proposed models to explain the particle acceleration in solar flares . the particle acceleration in and near the reconnection region has been well discussed . for example , @xcite has studied the dc electric field acceleration in reconnecting current sheets . @xcite",
    "have discussed the nonadiabatic acceleration in the vicinity of the reconnection region at which the gyro radius is comparable to the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .",
    "fermi acceleration by the contraction of magnetic islands has been studied by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the acceleration near the reconnection region , stochastic acceleration mechanisms in the reconnection downstream region have been proposed by e.g. , @xcite ( fast - mode magnetohydrodynamic waves ) and @xcite ( oblique shocks ) , although necessary high - frequency waves for the particle scattering is poorly known in the solar circumstance .",
    "the models greatly contribute to the understanding of how particles are accelerated to observed energies .",
    "for the complete understanding of many observed features , however , we should take into account the particle transport and dissipation processes as well as the acceleration in a realistic environment of the solar corona .",
    "this is because observed quantities do not necessarily reflect the particle distribution just at the acceleration site , but are the convolution of all of these processes @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed a model called `` collapsing trap '' , in which the particle acceleration , transport , and dissipation naturally follow from the shrinkage of magnetic loops driven by reconnection .",
    "these processes are almost adiabatic in the trap , because the particle gyro scale ( @xmath1 for electrons ) is much smaller than the flare scale ( @xmath2 ) due to very strong magnetic fields in the corona .",
    "the adiabatic acceleration may take place everywhere in the trap , which diminishes a serious problem that the number of accelerated particles required for observed hxr intensities is comparable to the number in a whole flare region @xcite .",
    "the mechanism can be regarded as the subsequent acceleration process that occurs after the acceleration near the reconnection region , and as the co - existing process with the acceleration in the downstream region .",

    "these observations indicate that the electric field greatly influences the distribution of electrons during their travel in the corona .",

    ", we theoretically study the evolution of the particle distribution based on the numerical simulation . for this purpose ,",

    "the equation describes the full kinetics of the particle transport along and across magnetic field lines , acceleration by electric fields , and the gyromotion , thus can resolve the inertia and gyro scales of particles .",
    "when the typical scale of interest is much larger than the gyro scale , it is rather convenient for focusing on the macroscopic distribution of particles to adopt a guiding - center equation ( drift kinetics ) than the full kinetic equation . in this paper",

    "the time derivative of the position ( eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) ) is expressed by the parallel and perpendicular drift motions to the magnetic field line .",

    "the velocity space distribution is of help to understand the mechanism around there .",
    "figure [ fig : psd_lt ] shows the velocity space distribution function taken at the loop top @xmath76 at @xmath64 s. the horizontal and vertical axes correspond to the velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field line .",
    "the distribution significantly deviates from the initial , isotropic maxwell distribution .",
    "it shows the loss - cone distribution with a loss - cone angle ( white lines ) defined as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the @xmath39-position at the footpoint of a specific field line determined from @xmath79 the distribution also shows a strong enhancement of the number of electrons perpendicular to the field line .",
    "the perpendicular enhancement is energy dependent ; the distribution is more anisotropic for higher energy electrons .",
    "this means that high energy electrons are produced by the acceleration perpendicular to the field line , that is , the betatron ( @xmath4 drift ) acceleration .",
    "since the electron pitch angle becomes close to 90 degrees by the betatron acceleration , accelerated electrons are further confined and energized at the loop top with time . by taking the second - order momentum of the distribution function",

    "the spatial distributions of the parallel and perpendicular temperatures at @xmath75 s and 10 s are shown in figure [ fig : temp_dist ] . around the loop top , we can see a slight decrease of the parallel temperature and a strong increase of the perpendicular temperature relative to an initial temperature 3 kev .",
    "the decrease of the parallel temperature is due to the loss of electrons inside the loss cone .",
    "the perpendicular temperature reaches a maximum @xmath83 kev at @xmath84 at @xmath85 s. the acceleration increases the perpendicular temperature by a factor of 5 relative to the initial . on the other hand , the rate of the betatron acceleration for electrons with @xmath86 is easily obtained from the conservation of the magnetic moment ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the kinetic energy .",
    "since the loop at @xmath76 at @xmath85 s is convected from the initial position @xmath89 by the @xmath24 drift , a compression ratio at the loop top is @xmath90 which is larger than the estimated increase rate of the perpendicular temperature .",
    "this is because the betatron acceleration less works for electrons with smaller pitch angles .",
    "they are accelerated rather parallel to the magnetic field line through the inertia drift .    to consider the acceleration due to the inertia drift in the closed loop , it is convenient to introduce the longitudinal adiabatic invariant , @xmath91 . here",

    "the rate of the inertia drift acceleration is @xmath96 by numerically calculating the length of the loop that is initially at @xmath97 ( the same loop as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath98 electrons that experience the inertia drift acceleration escape from the loop top and their distribution diffuses along the field line .",
    "this yields the perpendicular temperature that is not as much as expected from the field compression ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) ) . nonetheless , the resulting velocity space distribution is enhanced perpendicular to the field line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psd_lt ] ) , because the rate of the perpendicular acceleration @xmath99 is larger than the parallel @xmath100 .",
    "this is the general feature of acceleration with conserving both the magnetic moment and longitudinal invariant .      in the previous section",
    ", we discussed the acceleration taking place in the closed loop .",
    "it is interesting to discuss whether the acceleration occurs also in open field lines .",
    "figure [ fig : psd_sp ] shows the electron pitch - angle distribution in the open field line near the magnetic separatrix at @xmath101 at @xmath75 s. the positive ( negative ) value of the pitch - angle cosine corresponds to the sunward ( antisunward ) direction .",
    "the pitch - angle distribution is different between sunward and antisunward directions . for sunward ( @xmath102 )",
    "the distribution is almost isotropic , because isotropic electrons are continuously injected from the upper boundary . for antisunward ( @xmath103 ) , on the other hand , the distribution deviates from an isotropic distribution . we see lack of electrons with @xmath104 , also due to the boundary condition .",
    "since we impose the lower boundary condition as almost vacuum for high energy electrons , the antisunward electrons are composed by those that are injected from the upper boundary ( with @xmath102 ) and then are reflected ( change the sign of @xmath105 ) by the magnetic mirror force . injected electrons with @xmath106 can not be reflected , and are lost at the lower boundary . therefore electrons with @xmath104 are not found along open field lines .",
    "we find a slight enhancement of the number of electrons with @xmath107 and decrease with @xmath108 , compared to those with @xmath102 .",
    "this is an evidence of the parallel acceleration to the magnetic field line due to the inertia drift : electrons are accelerated antisunward along the curved line by the centrifugal force .",

    "* ) , and in quasi - perpendicular shocks @xcite .",

    "the velocity of the mirror point measured in the de hoffmann - teller frame is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an angle of the magnetic field line between the departure and mirror points of an electron .",
    "when @xmath109 is sunward in the rest frame , the mirror point moves antisunward in the de hoffmann - teller frame .",

    "the other is the inertia drift acceleration in open magnetic field lines , which produces antisunward electrons .",
    "the resulting velocity space distribution significantly deviates from an isotropic distribution .",
    "the betatron acceleration yields more confinement of higher energy electrons at the loop top , as previously mentioned in the collapsing trap model . they can be a candidate for radiating loop - top nonthermal emissions such as `` above - the - loop - top '' hxr sources @xcite and microwaves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have found that the distribution of electrons is enhanced perpendicular to the field line when they are injected into a loop , from both observations of the 2003 may 29 flare and a numerical modeling of the electron transport with the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this result can be interpreted that the betatron acceleration is the most dominant mechanism for the electron energization in the flare .",
    "the betatron acceleration at the loop top is quite reasonable to radiate loop - top nonthermal emissions .",
    "however , it is widely known that the most of hxr emissions are from footpoints of the loop .",
    "this indicates a large amount of electrons precipitating there . in the model",
    "almost all of electrons are trapped in the loop .",
    "one of the reasons for this discrepancy is that the model has not taken into account the pitch - angle scattering .",
    "the pitch - angle scattering leads electrons into the loss cone , and significantly increases the rate of the precipitation .",
    "many authors have argued the effect of the pitch - angle scattering of electrons by the coulomb collisions with ambient plasma @xcite .",
    "another agency for the scattering is plasma waves . in particular , we suggest whistler waves as a possible candidate , because the perpendicular temperature anisotropy at the loop top in the simulation ( fig . [",
    "fig : temp_dist ] ) is unstable for the whistler wave growth .",
    "the enhancements of the pitch - angle scattering by the interaction with whistler waves might efficiently work on the precipitation and subsequent hxr emissions at footpoints , similar to the precipitation of radiation belt electrons and diffuse auroral emissions at the earth .",
    "we plan further simulations with including the pitch - angle scattering as diffusion terms in equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "the number of escaping electrons produced by the inertia drift acceleration has been estimated up to @xmath138 % of the background ( fig .",
    "[ fig : escape_profile ] ) .",
    "the escaping electrons have been observed in association with flares , and their number is estimated to @xmath139 % of the observed hxr - emitting electrons precipitating into the chromosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed number of escaping electron is expected to be less than @xmath138 % of the background , because the observed number of hxr - emitting electrons should be less than the background .",
    "therefore our estimation from the simulation can account for observations .",
    "the inertia drift acceleration takes place in a whole area of open field lines and contributes this high efficiency , as long as curved magnetic field lines keeps moving .",
    "it is noted that the observation can be understood without a complex phenomenon such as magnetic reconnection for the acceleration .",
    "because of its ubiquity , we suggest the inertia drift acceleration as a possible mechanism for producing escaping electrons that are not always associated with flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have reported the so - called `` micro type - iii '' radio bursts .",
    "micro type - iii radio bursts , characterized by short - lived , continuous , and weak emissions , are thought to be an evidence of the ubiquitous electron acceleration in the solar corona .",
    "they have found that the micro type - iii radio bursts are observed when the active regions bordering on coronal holes appear .",
    "it may suggest that parent electrons are accelerated near the boundary and then escape into interplanetary space .",
    "we have shown that antisunward electrons are produced especially near the magnetic separatrix , which qualitatively supports the observational results of @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : electron - escape ] we have discussed that the time profile of the escaping electrons by the inertia drift acceleration reflects that of the electric field , because the travel time of the electrons is faster than the time scale of the temporal change of the electric field . as long as satisfying the condition , it is expected that the time scale of the escaping electrons becomes shorter following more rapid change of the electric field than we have employed ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "it may explain type - iii radio bursts that have an elemental time scale shorter than @xmath138 s , while other mechanisms may also contribute to the acceleration .",
    "the escaping electrons may further be accelerated at a higher altitude , for example , the vicinity of the reconnection region and the possible turbulent region .",
    "the inertia drift acceleration can contribute to supply electrons to the higher corona and the interplanetary space where the secondary acceleration may occur .",
    "@xcite have reported that the electron distribution in the loop is enhanced parallel to the field line in the 2006 december 13 flare .",
    "they have argued that the distribution could be formed , if the inertia drift acceleration efficiently takes place .",
    "such a distribution has not been formed in our model . in the drift - kinetic model ,",
    "the betatron and inertia drift accelerations take place simultaneously ; the former enhances the velocity distribution in the perpendicular direction while the latter in the parallel .",
    "the resulting distribution is determined by combination of these accelerations .",
    "we have found in  [ sec : electr - distr - clos ] that the rate of the betatron acceleration @xmath99 is more efficient than that of the inertia drift @xmath100 in the closed loop of the model magnetic field .",
    "however , it may be expected that the inertia drift acceleration overcomes the betatron in different field configurations , and it is possible that the resulting electron distribution is enhanced rather parallel to the field line .",
    "let us simply consider the relationship between the magnetic field configuration of the loop and the distribution of accelerated particles .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field strength at the loop top is proportional to its altitude , @xmath140 .",
    "when the magnetic field is compressed by a factor of @xmath141 , the altitude decreases by a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "we assume that the travel length of particles along the field line @xmath92 is proportional to the altitude . from equations ( [ eq:25 ] ) and ( [ eq:27 ] ) , we describe the increase of the perpendicular and parallel energies through the compression as @xmath143 it is found that particles are accelerated perpendicular rather than parallel to the magnetic field line when @xmath144 .",
    "figure [ fig : b_height ] shows the local index @xmath145 of the model magnetic field at the apex of loops ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the index is much larger than 2 at the higher altitude where electrons are more accelerated by stronger electric fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xzimgs ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the perpendicular enhancement of the electron distribution function around the loop top , shown in figure [ fig : psd_lt ] .",
    "meanwhile , we propose from equation ( [ eq:29 ] ) that it may be possible to enhance the particle distribution parallel to the field line when the loop configuration meets @xmath146 . to verify this hypothesis",
    ", we should perform simulations with various field models , e.g. , mhd simulation results @xcite , and realistic fields extrapolated from _ hinode _",
    "observations @xcite . toward the understanding of particle acceleration in solar flares through both the observations and simulations , it is critically important to study the relationship between a variety of magnetic field configurations and the resulting particle phase space distribution .     due to the numerical limitation",
    ", we have performed the simulation with a relatively high initial temperature 3 kev .",
    "although the acceleration efficiency is dependent on the temperature , it does not mean that the pre - acceleration is necessary for the proposed acceleration mechanisms .",
    "in fact , we have also performed the simulation with an initial temperature 1.5 kev , and obtain similar results .",
    "this is to be expected , because the adiabatic betatron acceleration takes place similarly regardless of the particle energy . for the inertia drift acceleration",
    ", the particle velocity should be faster than the mirror point velocity to be reflected .",
    "electrons can easily meet this condition . therefore the acceleration takes place even for electrons with the temperature lower than we have employed in this study .",
    "let us discuss the effect of the three - dimensionality of ambient fields , for example , the shear motion and/or guiding magnetic fields .",
    "in the three - dimensional system , the fields may evolve so as to generate field - aligned currents .",
    "the career of the current should be electrons , because of their high mobility .",
    "if electrons are inhibited to move along the field line by such as the magnetic mirror force and the pressure gradient ( acting as a resistivity ) , parallel electric fields will be generated and accelerate electrons , to carry the current required from the field evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , their distribution will be significantly modified from the two - dimensional system , particularly in the parallel direction .",
    "the concept of the current - voltage relation has been utilized especially for the auroral particle acceleration along the magnetic field line at the earth . for the electron acceleration in the three - dimensional system",
    ", it may be essential to consider the parallel electric field and the electrostatic potential .",
    "based on the drift - kinetic theory , we have developed a comprehensive model for particle acceleration and transport in solar flares . using this model , we have simulated the time evolution of the electron distribution in a flaring region .",
    "there are two dominant mechanisms of electron acceleration .",
    "the betatron acceleration takes place at the top of closed loops .",
    "it can be a generation mechanism of electrons that radiate loop - top nonthermal emissions .",
    "the phase space distribution of accelerated particles in the loop strongly depends on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "the inertia drift acceleration also takes place in open magnetic field lines , producing escaping electrons from the sun .",
    "the number of escaping electrons estimated from the simulation can account for the observed number of flare - associated escaping electrons .",
    "the inertia drift acceleration is caused by a motion of curved field lines , which is not necessarily driven by magnetic reconnection . in this sense , we propose the acceleration in this study as a mechanism for producing escaping electrons that are not always associated with flares .",
