    "over the past two decades , the boltzmann  gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics has undergone an important conceptual shift . while successful in describing stationary systems characterized by ergodicity or metric transitivity",
    ", it fails to reproduce statistical behavior of many real - world systems in biology , astrophysics , geology , and the economic and social sciences .",
    "it is symptomatic of such cases that one tries to find refuge in a new paradigm known as `` generalized statistics '' .",
    "the notion `` generalized statistics '' refers to statistical systems that are described with broad ( or fat - tail ) distributions for which the usual central limit theorem is inapplicable .",
    "examples include generalized hyperbolic distributions , meixner distributions , weibull , distributions , and various power - law tail distributions ( e.g. , zipf ",
    "pareto , lvy , mandelbrot , or student - t ( tsallis - type ) distributions ) . the underlying mathematical underpinning and terminology involved",
    "are provided by various generalized central limit theorems ( gclts ) , most notably by gclt of p.  lvy  @xcite and b.v .",
    "gnedenko  @xcite or by non - markovian gclts  @xcite . in effect , gclts represent pertinent frameworks incorporating such crucial theoretical concepts as lvy processes , mandelbrot s lvy flights  @xcite , information - theoretic systems of rnyi  @xcite , non - extensive systems of tsallis  havrda  charvt ( thc )  @xcite and their various generalizations  @xcite .",
    "associated real - world phenomena obeying generalized statistics account for a rich class of statistical behaviors often observed in complex dynamical systems ranging from financial markets  @xcite , physics  @xcite and biology  @xcite to geoscience  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to point out that with the help the path integral ( pi ) one can identify interesting new playgrounds for thc generalized statistics .",
    "in particular , the statistics in question is represented by distributions that emerge when the maximal - entropy ( maxent ) prescription is applied to thc and rnyi information measures ( or entropies ) .",
    "regardless how narrow this class may seem , it constitutes an immense wealth of real - world systems ranging from low - dimensional ( at the edge of chaos )  @xcite and high - dimensional ( self - organized criticality )  @xcite nonlinear dissipative systems , through well developed turbulence  @xcite to long - range magnetic and fluid - like systems  @xcite . here",
    "we wish to shed yet another light on thc generalized statistics by showing that it also represents a pertinent framework for the statistical physics of random chains .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we present some essentials for both rnyi and thc statistics that will be needed in the main body of the paper . in section  [ sec2bc ] ,",
    "we reveal and discuss the group structure of the thc `` inverse temperature '' parameter .",
    "the group in question is the mbius parabolic group which is a one - parametric subgroup of the projective special linear group @xmath1 . for the generalized statistics in question we formulate the relevant path - integral representation for both the density matrix and partition function",
    "this is done in section  [ sec3 ] with the help of schwinger s trick . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we show that the representation of the density matrix obtained naturally arises in the statistical theory of random chains .",
    "we illustrate our point with the schultz ",
    "zimm polymer .",
    "important representatives of random chains are fluctuating particle histories as encountered , for instance , in quantum mechanics or quantum field theory .",
    "remarkably , when we apply the generalized density matrix obtained to a free _ non - relativistic _ particle in @xmath2 spatial dimensions we find that its is equivalent to the ( canonical bloch ) density matrix for a free _ relativistic _ particle in @xmath2 space - time dimensions provided we set @xmath3 or @xmath4 . this fact is proved in section [ sec4 ] where also a generalization to a field - theoretical context is discussed .",
    "finally , section  [ sec7 ] summarizes our results and discusses possible extensions of the present work . for the reader s",
    "convenience the paper is supplemented with two appendices which clarify some finer technical details . in appendix",
    "a we derive the schulz  zimm distribution of chain lengths for relevant parameter values and in appendix  b",
    "we show how the generalized density matrix obtained can be seamlessly fitted into a computation of the one - loop contribution to the gibbs free energy in the case of scalar quantum electrodynamics .",
    "a useful conceptual frame that allows to generate important classes of observed distributions is based on information entropies .",
    "information entropies generally represent measures of uncertainty or ignorance inherent in a distribution describing a given statistical or information - theoretical system .",
    "central rle of information entropies is in that they serve as inference functionals whose extremization subject to certain constraint conditions ( known as prior information ) yields maxent distributions which often have direct phenomenological relevance .",
    "importance of information entropies as tools for inductive inference ( i.e. , inference where new information is given in terms of expected values ) in statistical physics was emphasized by many authors ( see , e.g. , references in  @xcite ) , and presently maxent approaches belong among standard techniques from the statistical physics toolkit  @xcite .    among the many possible information entropies we shall focus our attention here on two specific cases ; first on rnyi s entropy  @xcite defined as @xmath5 and second on the thc entropy  @xcite which has the form @xmath6 a discrete distribution @xmath7 is usually associated with a discrete set of microstates in statistical physics , or set of all transmittable source symbols in information theory . in the limit @xmath8 , the two entropies coincide with each other , both reducing to the shannon ( or shannon  gibbs ) entropy @xmath9 in this way the parameter @xmath10 [ or better @xmath11 characterizes the departure from the usual bg statistics or from shannon s information theory .",
    "let us remind that in the context of shannon s information theory it is well known  @xcite that the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be viewed as _",
    "inferences _ based entirely on prior information that is given in terms of expectation values of energy , energy and number of particles , energy and volume , energy and angular momentum , etc . in this case shannon s entropy quantifies the information about the detailed microscopic state ( microstate ) of the system , which remains `` uncommunicated '' by a description that is stated solely in terms of thermodynamic state variables ( phrased in terms of expectation values ) .",
    "it should be also stressed that the passage from the shannon ",
    "gibbs to clausius ( i.e. , thermodynamic ) entropy is established only when the relevant maxent distribution is inserted back into @xmath12 .",
    "only when this maxent prescription is utilized then @xmath12 turn out to be a thermodynamic _ state function _ and not a mere functional on a probability space .    in the spirit of maxent strategy one can formally repeat the aforementioned philosophy also for @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "it is still an open question , however , as to what extent the inferences obtained can be identified with some genuine statistical system . here we do not wish to dispute a usefulness of ensuing maxent distributions which clearly serve as excellent fitting distributions in number of contexts in complex dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "instead , we wish to point out that there are circumstances ( which will be discussed shortly ) when the ensuing generalized statistical systems ( and not only maxent distributions ) can be clearly identified with the real - world equilibrium statistical systems .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall proceed here only with the analogue of canonical ensembles , where the prior information is characterized by a fixed energy expectation value ( i.e. , the internal energy ) .",
    "the corresponding maxent distributions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be obtained by extremization of the associated inference function @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are lagrange multipliers , the latter being the analogue of the inverse temperature in natural units .",
    "the subscript @xmath18 denotes the expectation value with respect to the weights @xmath19 so that @xmath20 in practice it is common to chose only two values of @xmath18 that represent two different modes of application  . in information theory one typically uses the linear mean @xmath21 which corresponds to @xmath22 , while in non - extensive thermodynamics it is customary to utilize a non - linear @xmath10-mean @xmath23 which represents @xmath24 . in the latter case",
    "is @xmath25 called _ escort _ or _ zooming _ distribution  terminology that has its origin in chaotic dynamics  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", we could keep the value of @xmath18 general when employing the maxent procedure .",
    "when this would be done , say for rnyi s entropy , then the maxent distribution arises from the condition @xmath26 . for generic @xmath18",
    "this leads to a higher - order trinomial equation for @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 when @xmath29 . in the special case",
    "when @xmath22 we have @xmath30 here , @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ 6a ] ) and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ 6b ] ) .",
    "parameters involved read @xmath33   & & b_k \\ = \\ \\beta \\ \\ ! \\frac{r\\ \\!(1-q)[e_k - \\langle h \\rangle_r ] } { qz_r } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ 6a ] ) are generally not suitable for physical considerations because they do not provide _ unique _ and _ real _ solutions .",
    "there are only two cases in which the equations obtained are linear and thus yield a unique @xmath27 , namely when @xmath34 and @xmath24 .",
    "we note in passing that for special values of @xmath18 and @xmath10 a solution of ( [ 6a ] ) of the form @xmath35 can be found . with two constrains at hand we could eliminate @xmath36 or @xmath37 and rewrite @xmath17 in terms of @xmath38 ( or , more physically , @xmath38 in terms of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath27 would be , however , badly self - referential because either @xmath37 or @xmath36 would not be eliminated .",
    "again , cases @xmath34 and @xmath24 play a special rle here since only in these two cases the vexing self - referentiality will be eliminated .",
    "this in turn provides a mathematical ( although not physical ) backing for the two aforementioned choices of @xmath18 used in the literature . with this proviso the associated maxent distribution for rnyi s entropy reads @xmath39^{{1}/{(1+q-2r)}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{2.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the normalization constant ( basically the partition function ) .",
    "term is the inverse `` temperature '' of the system . by the same token one obtains for the thc case @xmath42^{{1}/{(1+q-2r)}}\\ !",
    ", \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\mbox{\\hspace{-4mm}}\\label{2.8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the inverse `` temperature '' @xmath43 .",
    "similarly as before , this holds only when @xmath22 or @xmath24 .",
    "so , in contrast to ( [ 2.7 ] ) , the thc maxent distributions are self - referential , i.e. , @xmath44 depends on the properties of the distribution itself .",
    "distributions of the form ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) are known as @xmath45-gaussian or tsallis ( thermostatistics ) distributions and they indeed appear in one form or another in numerous real - world statistical systems  @xcite . for historical reasons",
    "the case @xmath22 in eq .",
    "is also known as the bashkirov s @xmath46-st version of thermostatistics , while the case @xmath24 is called the tsallis @xmath47-rd version of thermostatistics  @xcite .    for future convenience",
    "we note that the maxent distributions ( [ 2.7])([2.8 ] ) can be viewed as @xmath48-deformed versions of the usual gibbs  boltzmann statistical distributions .",
    "for instance , using the box ",
    "cox @xmath48-exponential  @xcite , i.e. @xmath49^{1/(1-{\\mathfrak{q}})}\\ , , \\ ] ] the resulting @xmath45-gaussian distributions can be expressed in the succinct form @xmath50 here @xmath17 represents corresponding inverse `` temperature '' and @xmath51 is the normalization . since @xmath52 , it is clear that tsallis thermostatistics distribution approaches in the limit @xmath53 the standard maxwell  boltzmann distribution of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics .",
    "though the distributions ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) have almost the same form , the main difference is in the self - referentiality of @xmath44 .",
    "we will now illustrate that this subtle fact might have non - trivial ( in fact measurable ) consequences . to this end",
    "we first recall the notable fact from the boltzmann  gibbs statistics , namely that the maxent distribution is invariant under a constant energy shift @xmath56 .",
    "actually , this result is not the consequence of a particular form of the bg entropy as one could think , but rather it directly results from a legendre - transform structure and linear form of constraints  @xcite . with this proviso ,",
    "the invariance under a constant energy shift is independent of the specific form of entropy and is also valid for @xmath10-escort constraints .",
    "this fact can be also directly observed in distributions ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) where the shift factor @xmath57 does not appear in the spectrum - shifted distribution because the term @xmath58 is manifestly @xmath57 independent : @xmath59   =   ( e_i   - \\langle h \\rangle_r).\\ ] ] second , in the case of the bg distribution we can observe yet another important property , namely that it does not depend on @xmath60 _ explicitly_.",
    "this follows from a simple factorization property : @xmath61}{\\sum_j \\exp[- \\beta ( e_j - \\langle h \\rangle ) ] } =   \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta e_i)}{\\sum_j \\exp(- \\beta e_j)}\\ , .\\ ] ] we recall that the dependence on @xmath62 is _ implicitly _ contained in @xmath17 , because the distribution still has to fulfil the original constraint   turns out to be of key importance ( even more important than the internal energy @xmath62 ) so that physicist prefer to express @xmath62 in terms of @xmath17 rather than @xmath17 in terms of @xmath62 . ]",
    "@xmath63 which ( in principle ) allows to resolve @xmath17 in terms of @xmath62 .",
    "let us remind that in the bg statistics it is important to have the partition function without an explicit dependence on @xmath62 .",
    "explicit @xmath62 dependence would , for instance , obscure the connection between the partition function and helmholtz free energy .",
    "in addition , by combining the constant - energy shift invariance of @xmath64 with its lack of an explicit @xmath62 dependence one easily obtains the experimentally supported fact that the zero - point energy has no effect on the bg statistical thermodynamics and can be thus safely set to zero .",
    "it is a question , to what extent the _ desired _ absence of explicit @xmath62 in @xmath64 is inherited by distributions ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the case with the constant - energy shift @xmath56 , the factorization - like property for @xmath38 is less trivial in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.7])-([2.8 ] ) and in fact it can be achieved only under special circumstances . to see what is involved ,",
    "let us assume that the second maxent constraint ( [ 5.aa ] ) is not yet enforced , so that both the lagrange multiplier @xmath17 and @xmath65 are still independent . within this framework",
    "any @xmath65 appearing in considered distributions is explicit and the required lack of explicit dependence on @xmath65 can be formulated as a form - invariance of the distribution under the shift of @xmath38 .",
    "the maxent constraint can be then safely imposed at the very end of our reasonings .",
    "for @xmath64 the form - invariance under the shift @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) is a simple consequence of the identity @xmath68}{\\sum_j \\exp[- \\beta ( e_j - \\langle h \\rangle)]}\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] & = &   \\frac{\\exp[-\\beta(e_i - \\widetilde{\\langle h \\rangle})]}{\\sum_j \\exp[- \\beta ( e_j - \\widetilde{\\langle h \\rangle})]}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case @xmath17 is manifestly invariant under the shift ( [ ii.15.a ] ) .    for thc maxent distributions ( [ 2.8 ] ) we might recall that @xmath69 .",
    "since we shall ultimately be considering what happens under @xmath38 translations , we can write only @xmath70 . for further convenience",
    "we denote the shifted mean value @xmath71 simply as @xmath72 .",
    "we also set @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the case of @xmath75 , the form - invariance under arbitrary shift in @xmath38",
    "can be achieved by compensating for the shift by appropriately redefined / transformed form of @xmath44 . although this fact is known ( cf .",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) it deserves further qualifications .",
    "our subsequent derivation will thus follow route less traveled but more suitable to our needs .",

    "in this case we have @xmath84 by assuming that @xmath85 is @xmath86 independent ( otherwise @xmath87 would be @xmath38-shift dependent ) we can differentiate both sides of ( [ ii.20.a ] ) with respect to @xmath86 , which yields identity @xmath88 ^ 2(1+q-2r)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath89 is by assumption arbitrary , this can be fulfilled only when @xmath90 . for @xmath18 s at hand",
    "the latter is equivalent to @xmath91 , which in turn sends @xmath87 back to the bg distribution .",
    "the crux of course is , that @xmath92 ( unlike @xmath93 ) is not @xmath38 dependent and thus it does not have means to compensate for the shift in @xmath38 .",
    "let us now turn back to @xmath94 and observe that transformations   constitute the one - parameter subgroup of the projective special linear group @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen by realizing that @xmath1 is the quotient group @xmath95 , where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 stands for @xmath98 unit matrix ) .",
    "the special linear group @xmath99 is represented ( in its fundamental representation ) by @xmath100 real matrices with determinant one that act on a two - dimensional vector space as @xmath101 if we now identify @xmath102 and set @xmath103 , we find that @xmath104 transforms as  .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 in ( [ 13.bb ] ) is the required value of the shift between initial and final configuration .",
    "alternatively , we might identify @xmath105 and set @xmath106 . in this case",
    "we get the inverse transformation in terms of the original parameter @xmath72 .",
    "both ensuing linear fractional transformations are , of course , equivalent which is on the level of ( [ 13.bb ] ) and ( [ 13.bc ] ) reflected by the fact that the respective matrices satisfy the equivalence relation ( similarity transformation ) , mediated by the matrices @xmath107 for this reason it suffices to consider only one type of transformations , say ( [ 13.bb ] ) .    from ( [ 13.bb ] ) and group of transformations ( [ 2.10 ] )",
    "we see that the relation is not one - to - one since any two matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 from ( [ 13.bb ] ) correspond to the same transformation in ( [ 2.10 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have a _ homomorphism _ from a subgroup ( [ 13.bb ] ) of @xmath99 ( known as @xmath110 ) onto the group of linear fractional transformations ( [ 2.10 ] ) with kernel @xmath111 and thus @xmath112 is isomorphic to group of transformations ( [ 2.10 ] ) .",
    "@xmath113 is known as the _ parabolic subgroup _ of the projective group @xmath1 or equivalently as the ( real ) _ mbius parabolic group_. a crucial point in this context is that @xmath114 represents an invariant under the above group of mbius parabolic transformations  _ casimir invariant_. in the following we denote the invariant quantity @xmath115^{-1}$ ] as @xmath116 .",
    "such an invariant quantity represents a natural candidate for an _",
    "observable _ or a _",
    "state variable_. in fact , in number of cases it seems reasonable to identify @xmath116 directly with the statistical temperature .",
    "this step is , however , conceptually quite delicate because the thermodynamical temperature ( i.e. , temperature obtained via clausius or caratheodory type of entropy - temperature duality ) and statistical temperature ( i.e. , temperature that appears as the lagrange multiplier in maxent distributions ) are a priori not related in rnyi and thc statistics ( unlike in shannon - entropy based statistics ) . in the context of the thc statistics above issue",
    "has been discussed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the strategy usually employed is to design ( or engineer ) the rules of thermodynamics ( e.g. , the first law of thermodynamics or clausius theorem ) or jaynes maxent reasoning so that both temperatures coincide . in sections  [ sec6 ] and [ sec4 ] we will discuss the rle of @xmath116 from a different angle of view .",
    "in particular , we will see that is often more natural and conceptually less controversial to identify @xmath116 with other observables than temperature .",
