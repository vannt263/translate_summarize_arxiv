    "also , some real networks are scale - free ( sf ) with a power - law tail in their degree distribution @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of links per node , @xmath2 and @xmath8 are distribution parameters @xcite .    many statistical physics and mathematical techniques",
    "have been successfully applied to study network structure including percolation @xcite , scaling @xcite , partitioning @xcite , box covering @xcite , @xmath1-core percolation @xcite and @xmath1-shell decomposition @xcite .",
    "the latter has been recently used to study the topology of the internet at the autonomous system ( as ) level @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the as internet network consists of three distinct components :    * the nucleus consists of highly connected nodes ( hubs ) and constitutes a tiny fraction of the network ( @xmath9 ) . *",
    "the tendrils ( @xmath10 ) are the subgraphs that connect to the network exclusively via the nucleus . *",
    "the remaining nodes ( @xmath11 ) of the network constitute the bulk body . unlike the tendrils ,",
    "the nodes in the bulk remain connected even if the nucleus is removed .",
    "the appearance of the three components led to the association of the as internet structure with that of a jelly - fish model @xcite . for an alternative jelly - fish structure see also ref .",
    "the nucleus plays a crucial role in data transfer throughout the internet .",
    "if the nucleus is damaged or blocked , nodes in the tendrils cease to communicate with other nodes both in the bulk body and in other tendrils .",
    "however , the nodes in the bulk body can still communicate with each other , but less efficiently since the average path length between them almost doubles @xcite .",
    "the network of workplaces in sweden @xcite was also shown to possess a jelly - fish structure .",
    "mean field analysis of the @xmath1-shell structure @xcite focuses on random networks with a given degree distribution @xmath12 .    in the present work we address the long - standing question of how long does a typical leader in an industry maintain its position",
    "this question has attracted continuing attention in the industrial organization literature over the past generation @xcite .",
    "two rival views exist .",
    "the first asserts that leadership tends to persist for a long time while the second one emphasizes the transience of leadership positions due to radical innovation and `` leapfrogging competition '' .",
    "the life sciences ( ls ) sector is generally cited as an archetypal example of stability of industry leaders while on the contrary the information and communication technology ( ict ) sector is widely considered as a good example of high market turnover and instability . we study the @xmath1-shell structure of the ls and ict industry in order to test these views and better understand the reasons behind the higher stability of the leading firms in the ls sciences and the ict sector .",
    "the networks of ls and ict firms are networks of nodes representing firms in the worldwide ls and ict industries with links representing the collaborative agreements among them @xcite .",
    "we also conduct a numerical analysis of model sf networks in order to better understand their @xmath1-shell structure .",
    "we study how the size and the connectivity of the three components of random sf model networks depend on the sf parameters .",
    "we compare the @xmath1-shell structure of sf models with that of the ls and ict industry networks in order to get a better insight into the growth principles of the industry networks .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii we define the k - shell decomposition and apply it to both real and model sf networks .",
    "we then analyze the leadership in the industry networks from the @xmath1-shell perspective . in section iii",
    "we conduct a systematic analysis of the properties of the three components of model sf networks . in section",
    "iv we compare the results for sf models with those observed in the two industrial networks .",
    "we conclude our manuscript in section v with a discussion and summary .",
    "we start the process of the @xmath1-shell decomposition @xcite on a network by removing all nodes with degree @xmath14 . after the first iteration of pruning",
    ", there may appear new nodes with degrees @xmath14 .",
    "we keep on pruning these nodes until only nodes with degree @xmath15 are left . the removed nodes along with the links connecting them form the @xmath16 shell .",
    "next , we iterate the pruning process for nodes of degree @xmath17 , thereby creating the @xmath18 shell .",
    "we further continue the @xmath1-shell decomposition for higher values of @xmath7 until all nodes of the network are removed . as a result",
    "each node in the network is assigned a @xmath1-shell index @xmath1 .",
    "the largest shell index is called @xmath19 , which is also the total number of shells in the network , provided all shells below @xmath20 exist .",
    "the @xmath1-crust is defined as the union of all @xmath1-shells with indices smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1-core is defined as the union of all nodes with indices greater or equal @xmath1 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ drawing ] for demonstration . ) as we explain later , the set of nodes in the @xmath19 shell is called nucleus provided there is a large number of nodes ( tendrils ) connected to the network exclusively via the @xmath19 shell .",
    "we analyze the @xmath1-shell structure of ls and ict industrial sectors in time periods between 1990 and 2002 and between 1990 and 2000 respectively . the ls network",
    "expanded linearly since the mid-1970s while the ict network took off in the 1990s and grew exponentially for a decade [ see fig .  [ growth](a ) and the inset ] .",
    "the total number of firms in the ls is @xmath21 and in the ict is @xmath22 .",
    "these sizes refer to the largest connected component of each of the networks at the last year of observation .",
    "both industrial networks feature sf degree distributions with @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( ls ) and @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( ict ) [ see fig .  [ growth](b ) ] .",
    "we use the kholmogorov - smirnov test in order to examine the goodness of fit of the degree distributions .",
    "the obtained p - values for @xmath27 trials are @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the ls and the ict industry networks respectively .",
    "we next apply the @xmath1-shell decomposition procedure to the ls and the ict networks . for each @xmath1-crust",
    "we calculate the total number of nodes , @xmath30 , comprising it , the size of the largest connected component , @xmath31 , in the @xmath1-crust and the size of the second largest component , @xmath32 , of the @xmath1-crust . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_real_kshells ] , the ls network consists of @xmath33 shells while the ict network ( which consists of comparable number of firms ) has only @xmath34 shells .",
    "the size of the largest cluster in the @xmath1-crust starts growing rapidly after @xmath35 and @xmath18 in the ls and the ict networks respectively . at these values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the size of the second largest cluster in the @xmath1-crust reaches a maximum .",
    "the above behavior of the @xmath1-crust components is consistent with the existence of a second order phase transition in the @xmath1-crust structure @xcite .",
    "the type of the phase transition taking place at the @xmath1-shell decomposition is similar to that of targeted percolation in sf networks @xcite .    unlike in the ict network",
    ", the size of the largest connected component @xmath31 in ls network undergoes a large jump @xmath36 , while the total size @xmath30 of the crust experiences only a small change @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_real_kshells](a ) ) .",
    "this can be explained as follows @xcite .",
    "approximately @xmath38 of the he ls network are firms ( which we call `` tendrils '' ) that prefer to sign collaborative agreements exclusively with the @xmath39 firms that form @xmath40 shell ( which we call nucleus ) .",
    "typically , each of these firms ( tendrils ) signs a small number of agreements with firms in the nucleus and , therefore , has small degree .",
    "thus , the tendrils are removed in the decomposition of the first few shells . however , being connected exclusively to the nucleus in the @xmath41 shell , the tendrils do not contribute to the largest connected component of the @xmath1-crust until the last @xmath19 shell is decomposed .",
    "it is the inclusion of the tendrils firms into @xmath42 at the decomposition of the @xmath43 shell that results in the observed jump in @xmath42 .",
    "the appearance of the three components  the nucleus , the tendrils and the bulk body ",
    "allows one to associate the structure of the network of ls firms with that of the jelly - fish similar to the internet at the autonomous system level @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we do not observe the a similar jump in @xmath42 in the ict network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_real_kshells](b ) ) .    in both ls and ict industry sectors",
    "the @xmath43 shells include market leaders such as pfizer , gsk , novartis , j&j , sanofi - aventis , bayer in the ls network and microsoft , ibm , at&t , yahoo , cisco , aol , time warner and google in the ict network .",
    "we find that the ls network tendrils are mostly composed of the new start up firms and their university partners . on the one hand ,",
    "start up firms preferentially attach to market leaders . on the other hand ,",
    "market leaders compete to sign exclusive deals with new and promising start up firms .",
    "we also notice the remarkable stability of the ls nucleus : once a particular firm enters the nucleus it is very likely to remain there for many years.(see fig . [ fig_real_kshells]c ) on the contrary , in the ict sector there is more emphasis on how to integrate different technologies and markets @xcite .",
    "thus , there is more deals between firms of the same size and age but in different technological and market areas . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath1-shell of the ict network is more unstable and heterogeneous which may explain why we do not detect the emergence of a nucleus such as in the ls sector .    as discussed above",
    ", one can in general calculate the size of the nucleus @xmath44 as the total number of nodes in the @xmath43 shell    @xmath45    the increase in @xmath46 at @xmath47 is comprised by the inclusion of tendrils @xmath48 and the nucleus @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the size of tendrils can be calculated as @xmath49    as seen in fig .",
    "[ growth](b ) , both the ls and the ict industrial networks exhibit a sf degree distribution .",
    "hence , in order to better understand the substructures of real networks  the nucleus , the tendrils , and the bulk components  we analyze the @xmath1-shell structure of the random sf models which were generated using the configurational approach @xcite .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1-shell structure of random sf networks with @xmath50 , and degree distribution exponent @xmath51 $ ] . for our simulations ( fig . [ fig_kshells ] ) we choose networks sizes of @xmath52 ( which is comparable to the size of the ls and ict industry networks ) and @xmath53 in order to test the influence of finite size effects .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_kshells ] that both the number of shells @xmath19 and the jump in the largest connected component @xmath42 decrease as the exponent @xmath2 increases .",
    "as the jump becomes less pronounced it becomes harder to detect it which motivates us to introduce the quantitative criterion for the emergence of the three distinct components .",
    "we define the rate of change of the largest connected component size as @xmath54 we compare the increase of the largest connected component @xmath55 at @xmath47 with that at @xmath56 .",
    "the jump in @xmath42 results in @xmath57 we use eq .",
    "( [ nucleus_def ] ) as a criterion for the existence of a nucleus and tendrils .    by examining @xmath55 plot",
    "we observe in the case of @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kshells]c ) , that sf models with @xmath58 already do not have a nucleus and tendrils .",
    "however , for @xmath53 we do observe nucleus and tendrils in sf models for @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig_kshells]d ) .",
    "these observations suggest that all sf networks with @xmath60 have a nucleus and tendrils provided @xmath5 is sufficiently large .",
    "the above observations for sf models agree with the fact that we observe jelly - fish topology for ls network ( @xmath61 ) and do not observe it for ict network @xmath62 .",
    "however , sf model networks with @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 have @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , while the measured @xmath43 in ls and ict networks ( which have the same @xmath2 values ) are @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the observed difference in @xmath43 between industry networks and sf models with similar parameters suggests to further explore the @xmath1-shell structure of sf networks and consider sf model networks with @xmath70 values in @xmath12 ( as found in the ls and the ict networks ) .",
    "as shown above , sf networks may or may not have a jelly - fish structure , depending on the degree distribution @xmath12 and size @xmath5 . in order to better understand the @xmath1-shell structure of sf networks , we calculate the sizes of the @xmath1-shells as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "for each pair of values @xmath5 and @xmath2 we generate @xmath71 realizations of sf models and calculate the average number of shells @xmath19 constituting the network as well as their average size @xmath72 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig_sizes](f ) ] .    one can estimate the total number of shells in a random sf network of size @xmath5 as follows .",
    "since every shell constitutes a fixed fraction of @xmath5 it follows that @xmath79 .",
    "the last shell @xmath19 needs to possess at least one node @xmath80 , which leads to @xmath81 indeed , the total number of shells @xmath19 seems to increase as a power law with the network size @xmath5 [ fig .",

    "the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath5 can be regarded as a crossover from the small @xmath5 regime with @xmath86 where there is no nucleus to the power - law regime for @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( fig . [ fig_kmax_nucl]b ) .",
    "we relate the observed crossover with the emergence of the nucleus and tendrils in sf networks for @xmath89 . the critical size of sf networks , @xmath90 , corresponding to the emergence of the nucleus and tendrils in sf networks seems to increase as @xmath2 increases . in the @xmath91 regime",
    "the size of the last shell @xmath85 increases with @xmath2 , which can be explained by the fact that sf networks with higher @xmath2 have fewer shells . on the other hand , in the power - law regime ,",
    "the size of the last shell , @xmath85 , ( which now becomes the nucleus @xmath44 ) is smaller for larger values of @xmath2 .",

    "[ real_nws](c ) ] .",
    "the observed differences can be explained by taking into account the offset @xmath8 in sf degree distribution of both networks .",

    "the coexistence of preferential attachment regime with random collaborative agreements was suggested to take place in industry networks @xcite .",
    "the random component is caused by the fact that sometimes firms choose exclusive relationships and novelty , and do not prefer to make deals with hub firms . even though the coexistence of both preferential and random regimes seems to be crucial in the formation of the industry networks",

    "we use the @xmath1-shell decomposition to analyze the structure of the ls and ict sectors of industry . we find that the firms in the ls industry can be naturally divided into three components : the nucleus , the tendrils and the bulk body .",
