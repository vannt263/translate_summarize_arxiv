    "the lebesgue measure on the cone of positive vectors of @xmath9 can be described as the unique ( up to a multiplicative constant ) @xmath0-finite measure that is invariant with respect to the group @xmath10 ( the positive part of the cartan subgroup ) and homogeneous of degree @xmath11 with respect to homotheties . what is the infinite - dimensional analog of this fact ?",
    "first of all , what is the continual analog of the cartan subgroup ? and does there exist , in an infinite - dimensional space , a measure that is invariant with respect to the cartan subgroup and has a finite degree of homogeneity with respect to homotheties ?    the goal of this paper is to introduce a family of @xmath0-finite measures in the space of schwartz distributions on the interval ( or on a manifold ) that is invariant with respect to a continual group of multiplicators and has a finite degree of homogeneity with respect to homotheties .",
    "the measure with degree of homogeneity equal to one is called the _ infinite - dimensional lebesgue measure_.    more exactly , we consider @xmath0-finite borel measures , in the space of schwartz distributions on a manifold @xmath12 with measure @xmath13 , that are invariant under the action of the group @xmath14 of operators of multiplication by positive test functions @xmath15 satisfying the condition @xmath16 .",
    "this group is a direct continual analog of the positive cartan subgroup @xmath17 of the group @xmath18 .",
    "the above condition is an analog of the condition @xmath19 for matrices .",
    "it turns out that this invariance implies another invariance : these measures are invariant under the action of the group of measure - preserving transformations of the manifold ( this is an analog of the invariance of the ordinary lebesgue measure under the action of the symmetric group of permutations of coordinates ) ; this group plays role of weyl group in @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , we define a remarkable one - parameter family of @xmath0-finite measures @xmath1 , @xmath20 , enjoying this property , and prove a uniqueness theorem which says that @xmath1 is the unique ergodic , positive , @xmath0-finite measure on the cone of positive schwartz distributions that is finite on compact subsets , satisfies this invariance property , and has a fixed degree of homogeneity .",
    "the measures @xmath1 are closely related to the so - called poisson ",
    "dirichlet measures @xmath6 on the infinite - dimensional simplex and , consequently , to many combinatorial problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main applications of our measures is in the representation theory of current groups .",
    "the group of symmetries of the lebesgue measure @xmath5 ( the cartan subgroup ) allows us to use the space @xmath21 for constructing a realization of representations of the current group @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a semisimple lie group of rank @xmath24 .",
    "this measure was discovered in a series of papers by ( @xcite ) , and later ( @xcite ) , and applied for constructing a new model of these representations which , instead of the fock space with infinite - dimensional range of the one - particle subspace , uses @xmath25 .",
    "more generally , this gives a _",
    "new look on the construction of the continuous tensor product of hilbert spaces_. we can say that our construction is a contribution to the continuing discussion of what is integration in infinite - dimensional spaces .",
    "another aspect , which is discussed in the papers @xcite , is a deep parallelism between the gaussian measure ( white noise ) and our lebesgue measure .",
    "these two processes , the first one being a generalized stochastic process and the second one being a quasi - stochastic process ( the term `` quasi - stochastic '' means that instead of a probability measure on the space of the process we use a @xmath0-finite measure ) correspond to the two endpoints of the interval @xmath26 $ ] which is the set of parameters of stable lvy processes ( or stable distributions on the real line ) .",
    "the point @xmath27 of the interval @xmath28 $ ] corresponds to the white noise ( or to the wiener process , if one prefers to consider a process with independent increments instead of a generalized process with independent values ) ; the point @xmath29 , as the parameter of a stable distribution , has no direct sense : _ at this point , we must consider the derivative of the characteristic functional _ , and this gives our lebesgue measure ( see @xcite for the so - called notion of zero - stable law and zero - stable distribution ) .",
    "the gaussian measure ( white noise ) corresponding to the point @xmath27 is invariant under the action of the infinite - dimensional orthogonal group ; at the point @xmath29 , we have the invariance under the infinite - dimensional ( abelian ) linear group of multiplicators .",
    "the interval @xmath30 can be regarded as a deformation of one measure into the other one with unknown nonlinear group of symmetries .",
    "this paper is closely related to our previous papers @xcite and devoted to the same subject . in this paper",
    ", we put an end to the discussion concerning approximation of these measures with finite - dimensional invariant measures on the hyperspheres , which was started in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in that paper we insisted on an analogy between the situation with approximation of the infinite - dimensional gaussian measure and the infinite - dimensional lebesgue measure . in this paper",
    "we explain why there is such a drastic difference between the case of the white noise ( the maxwell  poincar lemma about the limit of measures on euclidean spheres ) and our case with noncompact homogeneous spaces ( hyperspheres ) .",
    "the key difference is the difference between the @xmath0-finiteness and finiteness of the orbital measures , or , shortly , between the noncompactness and compactness of the group of finite - dimensional symmetries ( the cartan and orthogonal groups ) . in a more physical language , this means the absence of equivalence between the grand and small canonical ensembles in the lebesgue case , in contrast to the equivalence of both ensembles in the gaussian case , see section  4 .",
    "we want to emphasize the similarity between the construction of the measures @xmath31 and the classical method of constructing stochastic lvy processes as gelfand ",
    "it processes .",
    "it is based on infinitely divisible measures and the corresponding characteristic functionals ( in the theory of stochastic processes , there is an equivalent language of `` random measures '' ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no ( at least to the author s knowledge ) general theory of `` @xmath0-finite lvy processes '' and no lvy ",
    "khintchin formula for the fourier ( or laplace ) transform of infinitely divisible @xmath0-finite measures on the real line and on @xmath32 .",
    "undoubtedly , the needed definition must be very similar to the classical one , and they must be unified in a general theory of finite and @xmath0-finite lvy processes .",
    "but since there is no such a theory , we use special considerations in our construction , see section  2 .",
    "let us briefly mention the history of what we called the infinite - dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "it seems that this measure first appeared in the papers @xcite , as a measure whose characteristic functional is the restriction of the canonical state on the group @xmath33 to the unipotent subgroup .",
    "later it became clear that there is a link between the gamma process and the lebesgue measure : the latter is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the gamma process , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this link was discussed in connection with the markov  krein transformation @xcite , stable laws @xcite , isomorphisms with the fock space @xcite .",
    "the connections between the representation theory of current groups and the lebesgue measure was recently considered in the joint paper of the author with m.  i.  graev @xcite .",
    "here are brief comments on the contents of the paper . in the second section we recall the definitions and basic properties of some important measures and processes ( dirichlet , gamma ) and",
    "introduce the measures @xmath34 , first as generalized processes or random measures .",
    "we use the link between these measures and the gamma processes .",
    "it is possible to generalize the classical theory of extension of cylinder measures in linear spaces , including the definition of gelfand  it generalized processes , to the @xmath0-finite case .",
    "the reference to the properties of the gamma processes immediately allows us to establish that the support of our measures @xmath1 is the set of discrete positive finite measures on the manifold ( the simplest type of schwartz distributions ) @xmath35    in the third section we describe the properties of the measures @xmath1 and their connection with the poisson ",
    "dirichlet measures @xmath6 .",
    "we define the laplace transform of @xmath1 : @xmath36 in the previous paper @xcite we took the formula for the laplace transform as a definition of these measures .",
    "we establish the invariance of our measures with respect to the continual cartan group @xmath14 ( see above ) and prove the uniqueness of an invariant measure with a given degree of homogeneity .",
    "there are many papers about the poisson",
    " dirichlet measures @xmath6 ( see @xcite and the references therein , and also the earlier papers @xcite ) . the measure @xmath6 is concentrated on the infinite - dimensional simplex of monotonic positive series with sum equal to one .",
    "it is covered by a measure on the larger simplex of all positive series with sum equal to one , which is usually called the gem - measure ( we do not mention it in the paper ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gem - measure was perhaps first introduced , in a different form , by w.  eberlein @xcite ( even for nonpositive series ) .",
    "we also consider the conic measures @xmath37 and prove the characteristic properties of these measures .",
    "the measure @xmath37 is maybe the most interesting object . in a sense ,",
    "it is more natural than the measure @xmath6 .",
    "this measure is concentrated on the cone of convergent monotonic positive series and has a large group of symmetries , which comes from the symmetries of the measure @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to obtain a characterization of the measure @xmath37 directly .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the approximation theory of the measures @xmath1 and comparison with white noise - we show that there is the new phenomenon of the absence of approximation and absence of equivalence of grand and small canonical ensembles in the case of the lebesgue measure .",
    "we introduce in the forth section the new function ( @xmath38 ) ( see also @xcite ) which is similar to free energy and must have important role in this theory .",
    "we only mention the two important generalizations of this measure : to absolutely convergent ( nonpositive ) series and to two - sided series ; this will be done later .",
    "let @xmath39 be a manifold with a fixed continuous finite borel measure @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , in what follows we may assume that @xmath39 is the interval @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath2 , or the unit circle , with the lebesgue measure @xmath13 : this case does not essentially differ from the case of a general manifold and even an arbitrary standard borel space .",
    "the measure @xmath13 is continuous , nonnegative , and finite , but not necessarily normalized ; we put @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 is a normalized measure .",

    "for some reason , we need to consider the space of schwartz distributions ( generalized functions ) @xmath48 , which contains @xmath44 , but we can avoid this by using an _ a priori _ knowledge about the structure of our measures .    we will equip the space @xmath44 and the cone @xmath49 with the weak topology that comes from the natural duality between the space @xmath44 and the space of bounded continuous , or even measurable , functions on the space @xmath12 : @xmath50 functions @xmath51 from the dual space will be called test functions .",

    "we recall the definitions of several finite - dimensional measures .",
    "let @xmath52 be the standard @xmath53-dimensional simplex .",
    "the dirichlet distribution @xmath54 on the simplex @xmath55 with parameter @xmath56 is the probability measure whose density with respect to the lebesgue measure or @xmath32 , we always mean that it is normalized so that the measure of the unit interval or cube is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "] is given by the formula @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the well - known gamma measure on the half - line @xmath59 with parameter @xmath4 has the following density with respect to the lebesgue measure : @xmath60    the gamma measure on the orthant @xmath61 with parameter @xmath62 is defined as the product of @xmath11 one - dimensional gamma measures with parameters @xmath63 and has the density @xmath64    the dirichlet distribution with parameter @xmath65 is nothing more than the projection of the gamma measure with the same parameter from the orthant to the simplex .",
    "the gamma distribution @xmath66 on the half - line is an infinitely divisible probability measure which generates a lvy process called the gamma process .",
    "the following simple fact is a consequence of the definitions , but it plays a very important role .",
    "let us represent the orthant @xmath67 as the product of the simplex and the ray @xmath68 ; then , with respect to this decomposition , we have the following decomposition of probability measures :    let @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71    this is a characteristic property of the gamma distributions .",
    "the same is true for the law of the gamma subordinator ( see below ) : this measure is the direct product of its projection onto the simplex and the gamma distribution on the half - line , and this fact characterizes the gamma processes among all lvy processes ( lukacs theorem , see @xcite ) .",
    "now we introduce infinite - dimensional measures . in the theory of stochastic processes , real - valued lvy processes , as well as other types of stochastic processes ,",
    "are traditionally defined with the help of so - called `` random measures , '' i.e. , measurable maps from the @xmath0-field of measurable sets of the parametric space to the space of measurable functions ( random variables ) with real values ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we interpret the notion of a random measure in the spirit of gelfand  it generalized stochastic processes .",
    "namely , the general definition of a generalized process , or weak distribution , is as follows .",
    "it is a self - consistent system of finite - dimensional distributions defined for each finite collection of linear functionals from a total set of linear functionals on the space @xmath48 ( i.e. , a set of functionals whose linear closed hull is the whole space ) , for example , the set of all characteristic functions of measurable subsets of @xmath12 . in our case , we will associate with an arbitrary finite measurable partition of the parametric space @xmath12 a finite - dimensional distribution in @xmath72 that is a self - consistent system of finite - dimensional distributions and is continuous with respect to the partitions .",
    "this is just a random additive measure in the usual sense from the point of view of the theory of generalized processes and weak distributions on the space of distributions @xmath48 . according to minlos theorem ,",
    "such a distribution determines a true probability measure on @xmath48 ( the law of the process ) , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we do not know if such a theory exists for the case of @xmath0-finite measures , so we use direct arguments for the description of @xmath0-finite measures ( see @xcite )",
    ".      we will simultaneously give the definitions of three one - parameter families of `` random measures , '' or generalized stochastic ( in the third case , quasi - stochastic ) processes .",
    "they determine the corresponding families of measures on the cone @xmath49 .",
    "two of them are classical and well - known : the _ dirichlet process _ and its measure @xmath73 ; and the _ gamma process _ and its measure ( law ) @xmath74 .",
    "the third one is a `` quasi - stochastic '' process , which produces a @xmath0-finite measure @xmath1 ; in particular , in this way we obtain the _ lebesgue measure _ @xmath5 .",

    "for example , for the gaussian measure in the infinite - dimensional linear space , the group of symmetries is the infinite - dimensional orthogonal group , and , according to the remarkable maxwell ",
    "poincar lemma , this measure is the weak limit of invariant measures on the finite - dimensional spheres of increasing radii ( see below ; for details , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this also proves the schoenberg theorem on description of @xmath252-invariant measures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the definitions of the white noise , regarded as a generalized process in the space @xmath253 , is in the framework of the theory of lvy processes : the one - dimensional gaussian measure is infinitely divisible , and the corresponding generalized process is exactly the white noise .",
    "this is parallel to the definitions of the gamma process and the `` @xmath0-finite lvy process '' from section  2 .",
    "we can also formulate this definition using a `` random gaussian measure . ''",
    "another equivalent ( dual ) definition uses the characteristic functional , or fourier transform .",
    "this notion makes sense not only for true @xmath0-additive borel measures , but also for cylinder measures , or generalized processes , which are defined only on the algebra of cylinder sets of a linear topological space with measure , or cylinder measure , @xmath161 : @xmath254 here @xmath255 is the distribution of the functional @xmath51 with respect to the ( cylinder ) measure @xmath161 .",

    "see @xcite for details and history .",
    "but the conclusion of our theorem involves another space rather than @xmath282 , and approximation in our case is quite different .",
    "theorems that claim that an infinite - dimensional measure with an infinite - dimensional group of symmetries is the weak limit of measures on the orbits of finite - dimensional groups can be regarded as claims about the equivalence of the small and grand canonical ensembles in statistical physics . in the case of the gaussian measure",
    ", this analogy can be pursued further .",
    "is it possible to approximate our measures @xmath1 in the same way using the orbits of the finite - dimensional cartan subgroups ?",
    "the similarity between the gaussian and lebesgue cases is obvious : both measures are obtained by the same construction of lvy processes , the first one being generated by the semigroup of gaussian measures on the line with density @xmath283 , and the second one , by the semigroup of @xmath0-finite measures with densities @xmath284 on the half - line . nevertheless , the difference between the infinite - dimensional gaussian and lebesgue measures is also big : the group of symmetries @xmath14 is abelian and does not contain a dense subgroup that is the limit of compact groups , as in the case of the orthogonal group @xmath252 .",
    "but it has many finite - dimensional noncompact subgroups .",
    "so we can consider the orbits of those subgroups that are smooth noncompact manifolds in the cone @xmath285 .    in comparison with the gaussian case , instead of the @xmath11-dimensional spheres @xmath286 of radius @xmath287 used in the maxwell  poincar lemma",
    ", we must consider a hypersurface , the `` hypersphere '' in @xmath32 defined as @xmath288 the number @xmath289 will be called the _ radius _ of the hypersphere ; it depends on @xmath11 .",
    "this hypersphere is a homogeneous space of the positive part @xmath290 of the cartan subgroup of @xmath291 .",
    "now let @xmath292 be the invariant @xmath0-finite measure on @xmath293 with some scaling (= a choice of a set of measure @xmath24 ) .",
    "we want to find the asymptotic properties of the invariant measure on the positive cartan subgroup @xmath294 ( consisting of positive diagonal matrices ) of the group @xmath295 as @xmath296 tends to infinity .",

    "laplace transform @xmath297 of the invariant @xmath0-finite measure on the hypersphere _",
    "@xmath293 : @xmath298 where @xmath299 are the dual variables .",
    "we introduce the function @xmath300 on the positive half - line @xmath301 which is sometimes called the mellin ",
    "barnes function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath302 where @xmath303 .",
    "the function @xmath300 is the inverse mellin transform of the @xmath11th power @xmath306 of the gamma function ( up to the multiplier @xmath11 , which we can omit ) .",

    "for example , for @xmath308 the mellin pair is @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",

    "it happens that a suitable saddle point is @xmath315 where @xmath316 is the root of the following equation : @xmath317 or @xmath318 the relation between these parameters is expressed by the following graph :              this answer proves the existence of the remarkable function @xmath38 and means that there is no convergence of the functions @xmath307 as @xmath322 and no convergence of the laplace transforms @xmath323 ( _ for any choice of the radius _",
    "@xmath324 ) of the invariant measures on the hyperspheres @xmath325 to a finite limit .",
    "thus @xmath300 does not tend to the value of the laplace transform of the measure @xmath34 at the constant function identically equal to @xmath321 , which is finite and equal to @xmath326 .",
    "consequently , there is no weak convergence of the measures @xmath327 ( in the sense of convergence of laplace transforms ) .",
    "so we can not represent the measure @xmath34 as the weak limit of finite - dimensional @xmath294-invariant measures . in turn",
    ", we can say that there is no equivalence of the grand and small canonical ensembles for the cartan subgroups .",
    "it seems that the `` tail '' of the hypersphere @xmath293 carries too much part of the measure in order to preserve the finiteness of the limit and violate the equivalence of the ensembles .",
    "the function @xmath38 is a very interesting object ; author does not know if it has been studied in the literature .",
    "it looks like the free energy in statistical mechanics and plays the role of the generator of the family of invariant measures on the hyperspheres .",
    "the graph of @xmath38 shows that it is similar to the graph of the function @xmath328 , which is the true generator of the one - parameter semigroup of one - dimensional lebesgue measures ( @xmath158 ) :          it is very easy to construct the family of lebesgue measures on the whole space @xmath44 instead of the measures @xmath1 on the cone @xmath49 : we need only to replace the gamma subordinator in the definition of @xmath1 with the whole ( nonpositive ) gamma process .",
    "the measures @xmath158 on the half - line must be replaced in all definitions with the measure on the whole line that is the symmetric extension of @xmath158 .",
