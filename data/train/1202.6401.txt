    "<S> isospin - dependent nuclear forces play a fundamental role in nuclear structure . in relativistic models of nuclear structure constructed at the quark level </S>",
    "<S> these isovector nuclear forces affect the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks differently , leading to non - trivial flavour dependent modifications of the nuclear parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effect of isospin dependent forces for parity - violating deep inelastic scattering on nuclear targets and demonstrate that the cross - sections for nuclei with @xmath2 are sensitive to the flavour dependence of the emc effect . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for nuclei like lead and gold we find that these flavour dependent effects are large .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the mechanisms responsible for the change in the per - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross - section between the deuteron and heavier nuclei remains one of the most important challenges confronting the nuclear physics community . in the valence quark region </S>",
    "<S> this effect is characterized by a quenching of the nuclear structure functions relative to those of the free nucleon and is known as the emc effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery has led to a tremendous amount of experimental and theoretical investigation  @xcite . however , after the passage of more than 25 years there remains no broad consensus regarding the underlying mechanism responsible for the emc effect .    </S>",
    "<S> early attempts to explain the emc effect focused on detailed nuclear structure investigations @xcite and the possibility of an enhancement in the pionic component of the nucleon in - medium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former studies were unable to describe the data and the latter explanation appears to be ruled out by drell - yan measurements of the anti - quark distributions in nuclei  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other ideas included the possibility of exotic , six - quark bags in the nucleus  @xcite or traditional short - range correlations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been argued that the emc effect is a result of changes in the internal structure of the bound nucleons brought about by the strong nuclear fields inside the nucleus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many of these approaches can explain the qualitative features of the emc effect but the underlying physics mechanisms differ substantially .    to make further progress in our understanding of the mechanism responsible for the emc effect , it has become clear that we require new experiments that reveal genuinely novel features of this effect . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose an important step in this direction , namely the exploitation of parity - violating dis ( pvdis ) , which follows from the interference between photon and @xmath3 exchange . when used in conjunction with the familiar electromagnetic dis data , it becomes possible to obtain explicit information about the quark flavour dependence of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow the predictions of any model of the emc effect to confront new experimental information and hence provide important insights into this longstanding puzzle .    </S>",
    "<S> the parity violating effect of the interference between photon and @xmath3 exchange , in the dis of longitudinally polarized electrons on an unpolarized target , leads to the non - zero asymmetry @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the double differential cross - sections for dis of right- and left - handed polarized electrons , respectively . in the bjorken limit @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath8 , \\label{eq : apv_bjorken}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the bjorken scaling variable of the nucleus multiplied by @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the fermi coupling constant and @xmath12 is the energy transfer divided by the incident electron energy . the @xmath13 term in eq </S>",
    "<S> .   originates from the product of the electron weak axial current and the quark weak vector current and has the form @xmath14 the plus - type quark distributions are defined by @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the quark charge , @xmath17  @xcite and the quark weak vector couplings are  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the weak mixing angle . </S>",
    "<S> the parity violating @xmath20 structure function of the target arising from @xmath21 interference is labelled as @xmath22 , while @xmath23 is the familiar electromagnetic structure function of traditional dis . </S>",
    "<S> the parton model expressions for these structure functions are  @xcite @xmath24 the @xmath25 term in eq .   is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this term is suppressed in the parity - violating asymmetry , @xmath7 , because of its @xmath30-dependent prefactor and the fact that @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath25 term will not be considered any further in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the parity violating structure function , @xmath32 , has a different flavour structure from that of @xmath33 and , as a consequence , @xmath34 is sensitive to flavour dependent effects . to illustrate this we expand @xmath13 about the @xmath35 limit , by ignoring heavy quark flavours we obtain @xmath36 a measurement of @xmath37 will therefore provide information about the flavour dependence of the nuclear quark distributions and when coupled with existing measurements of @xmath33 a reliable extraction of the flavour dependent quark distributions becomes possible . alternatively , if the isovector correction term in eq .   is known , then the parity violating asymmetry provides an independent method with which to determine the weak mixing angle . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we ignore heavy quark flavours , quark mass differences  @xcite and electroweak corrections , the @xmath0- and @xmath1-quark distributions of an isoscalar target will be identical , and in this limit eq .   </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath38 this result is analogous to the paschos - wolfenstein ratio  @xcite in neutrino dis , which motivated the nutev collaboration measurement of @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of @xmath37 as a measure of the weak mixing angle is that in the valence quark region strange quark effects are almost absent , which eliminates the largest uncertainty in the nutev measurement of @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also the isovector correction term in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> does not depend on @xmath39 and thus a measurement of @xmath37 at each value of @xmath9 constitutes a separate determination of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly however , in the context of this work , is that @xmath13 is sensitive to flavour dependent nuclear effects that influence the quark distributions of nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , because of this sensitivity , a measurement of @xmath13 on a target with @xmath40 would provide an excellent opportunity to test the importance of the isovector emc effect  @xcite for the interpretation of the anomalous nutev result for @xmath39 .    to determine the nuclear quark distributions and investigate their isospin dependence we use the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , which is a qcd motivated low energy chiral effective theory characterized by a 4-fermion contact interaction between the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the njl model has a long history of success in describing mesons as @xmath41 bound states  @xcite and more recently as a self - consistent model for free and in - medium baryons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the njl interaction lagrangian can be decomposed into various @xmath41 and @xmath42 interaction channels via fierz transformations  @xcite , where relevant details to this discussion are given in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar @xmath41 interaction dynamically generates a constituent quark mass via the gap equation and gives rise to an isoscalar - scalar mean field in - medium . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath41 interaction terms are used to generate the isoscalar - vector , @xmath43 , and isovector - vector , @xmath44 , mean - fields in - medium . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 interaction terms give the diquark @xmath45-matrices with poles corresponding to the scalar and axial - vector diquark masses . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon vertex function and mass are obtained by solving the homogeneous faddeev equation for a quark and a diquark , where the static approximation is used to truncate the quark exchange kernel  @xcite . to regulate the njl model we choose the proper - time scheme , which eliminates unphysical thresholds for nucleon decay into quarks , and hence simulates an important aspect of qcd , namely quark confinement  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to self - consistently determine the strength of the mean scalar and vector fields , an equation of state for nuclear matter is derived from the njl lagrangian using hadronization techniques  @xcite . in a mean - field approximation </S>",
    "<S> the result for the energy density is  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the @xmath41 couplings in the isoscalar - vector and isovector - vector channels respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy , @xmath49 , has the familiar mexican hat shape and the energies of the protons and neutrons moving through the mean scalar and vector fields are labelled by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> minimizing the effective potential with respect to each vector field gives the following relations : @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the proton and @xmath55 the neutron density . </S>",
    "<S> the vector field experienced by each quark flavour is given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .     </S>",
    "<S> +    the parameters of the model are determined by reproducing standard hadronic properties , such as masses and decay constants , as well as the empirical saturation energy and density of symmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical symmetry energy of nuclear matter , namely @xmath58mev , is used to constrain @xmath48 , giving @xmath59gev@xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the model parameters can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> using medium modified quark distributions  calculated following the techniques of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  we determine @xmath37 for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> in each case the total baryon density , @xmath61 , is kept fixed and only the proton - neutron ratio is varied . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a2 ] we present our results for @xmath37 in nuclear matter with a proton - neutron ratio equal to that of iron ( top ) and lead ( bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> the full result , which includes the effects from fermi motion and the scalar and vector mean - fields , is represented by the solid line . </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed line is the naive expectation where the nuclear quark distributions are obtained from the free proton and neutron pdfs without modification . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line is the result for isoscalar nuclear matter , which is given by eq .   and maybe a reasonable approximation to nuclei such as @xmath62c and @xmath63ca . </S>",
    "<S> when evaluating @xmath64 we have used the on - shell renormalization scheme value of @xmath65  @xcite .    the leading correction to @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> is isovector , as illustrated in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the difference between the naive and full results of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a2 ] is primarily caused by the non - zero @xmath66 mean - field . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the same effect which eliminates 1 to 1.5@xmath67  @xcite of the nutev discrepancy with respect to the standard model in their measurement of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , quite apart from the intrinsic importance of understanding the dynamics of quarks within nuclei , the observation of these large flavour dependent nuclear effects illustrated in figs .  [ fig : a2 ] would be direct evidence that the isovector emc effect plays an important role in interpreting the nutev data . </S>",
    "<S> it would also indicate the importance of flavour dependent effects in our understanding of the emc effect in nuclei like lead and gold , a point we will return to shortly .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 function is potentially sensitive to charge symmetry violation ( csv ) effects aswell , which are a consequence of the light quark mass differences and electroweak corrections  @xcite . including only the csv correction , eq .   </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are largely independent of the in - medium effects already discussed  @xcite and using the mrst parametrizations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with their central value of @xmath72 , we find this correction to be negligible on the scale of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , if these csv effects turn out to be larger than expected , they can be constrained via measurements on isospin symmetric nuclei , where the isovector emc corrections are mucj smaller .     +    the emc effect can be defined for both electromagnetic and parity violating dis via the ratio @xmath73 where @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding proton and neutron structure functions are respectively labelled by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , while @xmath77 is the structure function of the target . </S>",
    "<S> the naive structure function @xmath78 has no medium effects whatsoever , and therefore , in this limit @xmath79 would be unity . expressing the emc effect in terms of the quark distributions </S>",
    "<S> we find the parton model expressions @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the quark distributions of the target if it were composed of free nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> for an isoscalar target we have @xmath82 ( modulo electroweak , quark mass and heavy quark flavour effects ) . however , for nuclei with @xmath2 these two emc effects need not be equal . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line in figs .  [ fig : emc ] illustrates our emc effect results for @xmath83 in nuclear matter , with @xmath84 ratios equal to that of iron ( top ) and lead ( bottom ) , while the corresponding emc effect in @xmath85 is represented by the dot - dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as the proton - neutron ratio is decreased , the emc effect in @xmath83 increases , whereas the emc effect in @xmath85 is slightly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , for @xmath40 nuclei we find that @xmath86 on the domain @xmath87 , which is the domain over which our valence quark model can be considered reliable .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath88 and as a consequence @xmath86 in nuclei with a neutron excess is a direct consequence of the isovector mean field and is a largely model independent result . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in was demonstrated that the isovector mean field leads to a small shift in quark momentum from the @xmath0 to the @xmath1 quarks , and hence , the in - medium depletion of @xmath89 is stronger than that of @xmath90 in the valence quark region . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath89 is multiplied by a factor four in the ratio @xmath91 , the depletion is more pronounced for this ratio than for @xmath92 , where the @xmath1-quark quickly dominates as @xmath84 becomes less than one . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in figs .  [ fig : emc ] demonstrate that the flavour dependence of the emc effect is potentially large in nuclei like lead and gold .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that an accurate comparison of the electromagnetic and parity violating dis cross sections have the potential to pin down the flavour dependence of the emc effect . </S>",
    "<S> the most direct determination of this flavour dependence ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : emc ] ) would involve charged current reactions on heavy nuclei at an electron - ion collider  @xcite or with certain drell - yan reactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such experiments will not be possible for ten to twenty years . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , accurate measurements of pvdis on heavy nuclei should be possible at jefferson lab after the 12 gev upgrade  @xcite and would therefore provide a timely , critical test of an important class of models which aim to describe the modification of the nuclear structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments would complement alternative methods to access the quark substructure of nuclei , for example , the measurement of the emc effect for spin structure functions  @xcite , and as a corollary , would also offer a unique insight into the description of nuclear structure at the quark level . </S>",
    "<S> finally , they would constitute a direct test of the isovector emc effect correction to the nutev measurement of @xmath39 . </S>"
