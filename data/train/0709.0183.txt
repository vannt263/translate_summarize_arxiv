    "there are more indications and suggestions that outflows with wide opening angle occur in some systems , from progenitors of planetary nebulae ( pns ) to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "most prominent are observational indications for massive wide jets in agns ( behar et al .",

    "( 2007 ) to explain the inflation of fat ( more or less sphreical ) bubbles attached to the center of clusters of galaxies .",
    "massive - slow , but not wide , jets were considered and simulated by several groups in recent years ( e.g. , begelman & celotti 2004 ; binney 2004 ; omma et al .",

    "massive jets , for example , might be more efficient in maintaining a feedback heating in cooling flow clusters of galaxies ( soker & pizzolato 2005 ) .",
    "wide jets were considered ( soker 2004a ) and simulated ( akashi 2007 ; akashi & soker 2008 ) for inflating fat bubbles in pns in a process similar to that in clusters of galaxies . in some pns",
    "the motion of the nebula is ballistic , i.e. , the outflow velocity of different nebular segments is proportional to their distance from the center ( e.g. , sanchez contreras et al .",
    "this type of flow indicates that most of the nebular mass was ejected during a relatively short time .",
    "namely , a massive outflow , probably in the form of jets launched from the accretion disk around a companion . in some pns",
    "the jets are narrow , but in others might be wide .",
    "the question addressed in this paper is what are the conditions under which an outflow launched from the inner zone of an accretion disk can turn into a slow - massive - wide ( smw ) jet .",
    "the fast outflow from the inner zone of the accretion disk is termed here the fast - first - stage ( ffs ) jets , as there are two oppositely launched jets . in this paper",
    "i will consider wide jets formed by the ffs jets as they interact with a surrounding gas , and will term them slow - massive - wide ( smw ) jets , where by ` slow ' it is understood that the jet terminal sped is much lower than the escape speed from the accreting object and from the velocity of the ffs jets , and by ` massive ' it is understood that the outflowing mass in the smw jets is comparable to , or larger than , the accretion rate into the central accreting object .",
    "this type of outflow , although very different quantitatively , was simulated recently in a different setting by sternberg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and sutherland & bicknell ( 2007 ) .",
    "sutherland & bicknell ( 2007 ) simulated the interaction of jets with the ism in a disk inside elliptical galaxies . in their simulations",
    "the initial jets are cylindrical .",
    "the initial interaction between the jets and ism occurs very close to the center , at about few jet s diameter .",
    "practically , therefore , the jets are wide jets . in addition , the jet velocity in their model a is @xmath3 and the mass loss rate into two jets is @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , without stating it explicitly , they practically simulated slow - massive - wide jets .",
    "for that , it is not surprising that at early times they inflate hot bubbles ( soker 2004a ) as in the gasdynamical simulations of wide jets conducted by sternberg et al .",
    "later in the simulations of sutherland & bicknell ( 2007 ) the initial jets penetrate the ism , whereafter they are collimated by the ism and form narrow jets .",
    "the simulations of sternberg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and sutherland & bicknell ( 2007 ) show that in principle jets can accelerate surrounding gas into a wide slower outflow . in the present paper",
    "the initial setting is very different , but the physical mechanism is somewhat similar .    in section 2",
    "i consider the physical conditions near the accretion disk , while in section 3 i consider the constraints on the ffs jets .",
    "a short summary is in section 4 .",
    "i consider the formation of smw ( slow - massive - wide ) jets when the mass transfer rate to the accretion disk is large , and in addition the central accreting object might have a relative speed to the source supplying the mass .",
    "for example , in a binary system the accreting companion orbit the mass donor star , while the mass transfer rate is so high that the mass transfer occurs not only via a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) through the first lagrangian point ( l1 ) , but also by a wind concentrated around l1 . the high mass transfer rate and",
    "the relative motion of the accreting object relative to the mass source will lead to the presence of gas above and below the accreting object , namely along the symmetry axis of the accretion disk .",
    "in particular , if the mass inflow rate into the disk increases on a time scale shorter than the viscous time scale , the disk will not have time to rearrange itself , and the large departure from a steady state might lead to mass expelled to above and below the accretion disk .",
    "the large mass transfer rate implies higher density in the disk , hence higher optical depth ; the material might be optically thick above and below the disk , and not only in the disk .",
    "the energy released in the accretion disk by dissipation can uplift mass below and above the disk , but in general can not eject a massive jet by itself , as will be shown below .",
    "it is in this outset that the two jets launched from the central zone of the disk , what are termed here the fast - first - stage - jets ( ffs jets ) might eject a large mass out , and form a wide massive jet , which by energy conservations will be much slower than the ffs jets , i.e. , much below the escape speed from the accreting object .",
    "the initial geometry and flow structure are drawn schematically in figure 1 .",
    "-1.5 cm -0.0 cm    let us assume that a fraction @xmath5 of the energy released locally by the disk is channelled to uplift or eject mass from the disk .",
    "the energy released locally by the disk in an annulus @xmath6 and per unit time is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the accretion rate through radius @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the mass of the accreting object . let @xmath11 be the mass ejection rate from the annulus @xmath6 , and with a terminal speed @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the keplerian velocity at @xmath9 .",
    "energy conservation reads @xmath14 using the mass conservation @xmath15 , equation ( [ enn1 ] ) can be solved to yield @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass accretion rate through radius @xmath18 .",
    "if the material above the disk is optically thin , then @xmath19 and most of the mass injected into the disk at @xmath20 reaches small radii @xmath21 . the small amount",
    "that the disk does eject forms a disk wind .",
    "this wind is required to collimate narrow jets , as a confining external pressure is always required at the edge of accelerated jets ( komissarov et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the accretion rate is very high and mass flows above and below the disk , and we require the disk only to uplift material , namely , @xmath22 , then we have @xmath23 , and the disk can uplift a large fraction of the injected mass .",
    "for example , if @xmath24 , then the mass accreted at @xmath25 is only @xmath26 of the mass injected into the disk . the rest of the mass resides above and below the disk .",
    "this mass , by my assumption , has a very low terminal speed and will not be ejected from the system at a high speed and will not form a jet , but rather a disk wind . in the present paper",
    "i investigate the case where mass exist also along the symmetry axis of the accretion disk ; it can come from the outer region of the accretion disk and/or directly from the mass transfer process itself . in that case",
    "the ffs jets launched from the inner zone of the disk can not penetrate the dense material .",
    "instead the ffs jets form two hot bubbles that accelerate the disk wind and the material that reaches directly the regions above and below the disks ( see below ) , and a slower outflow , the smw jets , is formed .",
    "this is schematically drawn in figure 2 .",
    "-3.5 cm -0.0 cm      the inner zone of the accretion disk launches fast outflow into the two sides of the disk , the ffs jets .",
    "if the ffs jets penetrate the gas around the accretion disk they will be collimated by that gas , and two narrow collimated fast jets will be formed , similar to the flow structure in the simulations of sutherland & bicknell ( 2007 ) . by",
    "fast it is understood that the jet s speed is of the order of the escape speed from the inner zone of the disk .",
    "if , on the other hand , the ffs jets can not penetrate the surrounding gas they will accelerate the surrounding gas and form smw ( slow - massive - wide ) jets . in this section the conditions for the ffs jets not to penetrate the surrounding gas are derived .",
    "let the ffs jets from the inner disk zone have a mass outflow rate to both sides of @xmath27 , a velocity @xmath28 , and let the two ffs jets cover a solid angle of @xmath29 ( on both sides of the disk together ) .",
    "the density of the outflow at radius @xmath9 is @xmath30 let the ffs jets encounter the surrounding gas residing at distance @xmath31 in a shell of width @xmath32 , and density @xmath33 .",
    "the head of each jet proceeds at a speed @xmath34 given by the balance of pressures on its two sides .",
    "assuming supersonic motion this equality reads @xmath35 , which can be solved for @xmath34 @xmath36 the time the ffs jets crosse this shell and break out of it is given by ( for @xmath37 ) @xmath38 the mass residing in the surrounding of the disk is @xmath39 .",
    "taking @xmath32 , equation ( [ eq : tp1 ] ) becomes @xmath40    if there is no change in the system , the ffs jets will rapidly penetrate the surrounding gas .",
    "for example , let us consider a main sequence companion to an agb star .",
    "scaling quantities accordingly and taking from now on @xmath41 , and @xmath31 the size of the orbital separation , equation ( [ eq : tp2 ] ) reads @xmath42 for an accreting wd companion @xmath28 is @xmath43 times larger , but we can take lower mass loss rate in the ffs jets , so the penetration time is the same .",
    "namely , in @xmath44  years the ffs jets break out .",
    "this is a short time , and the ffs jets can not accelerate much mass out of the system . for scaling parameters used in equation ( [ eq : tp3 ] )",
    "the velocity of the smw jets can be found from energy conservation , which gives @xmath45 .",
    "this is too slow to be define as a jet in progenitors of pns .",
    "the interaction time must be longer in this case . for an accreting wd @xmath46 , and for the same other parameters as in equation ( [ eq : tp3 ] ) one finds @xmath47 , and @xmath48",
    "i am seeking a more efficient process , which requires a longer interaction time .",
    "indeed , under the assumption of this study there is a constant change over a time scale @xmath49 : either mass is resupplied to the surrounding gas ( from the donor and from the disk wind ) , or the accreting body moves relative to the surrounding gas , e.g. , an accreting star orbit the mass donor star .",
    "the condition for the ffs jets not to penetrate the surrounding gas is that the variation time scale be shorter than the penetration time @xmath50 .",
    "let the mass resupply rate to the surrounding gas be @xmath51 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : tp2 ] ) the condition @xmath50 becomes @xmath52 where in the second equality the ratio of the mass ejection rate in the ffs jets to the mass accretion rate , @xmath53 , was defined .",
    "we further define the velocity of the accreting body relative to the mass donor body , e.g. , the mass donor star in binary systems or the intracluster gas in clusters of galaxies , @xmath54 . then @xmath55,and we can cast equation ( [ eq : taus ] ) to be a condition on @xmath56 @xmath57      i will substitute typical numbers in the expressions derived in section 2.2 for four cases . in all case",
    "i will assume that @xmath26 of the accreted mass is launched in the ffs jets , i.e. @xmath58 , and that the the ffs jets interact with the surrounding gas before they are collimated , such that @xmath59 .",
    "some of the material in the ffs jets will interact with the dense disk wind , reducing the demand on the mass in the surrounding medium @xmath60 .",
    "for that , in what follows i scale the equations with @xmath61 .",
    "the first two cases are of an accreting wd or a main sequence star orbiting close to an agb star @xmath62 , such as expected in some progenitors of bipolar pns . typical relative orbital velocity of the two stars is in the range @xmath63 , which is larger than the agb wind speed of @xmath64 .",
    "i therefore take @xmath54 to be slightly larger than the average value of @xmath65 . for the ffs jets velocity i substitute the escape velocity .",
    "condition ( [ eq : ms1 ] ) reads @xmath66 for an accreting wd , and @xmath67 for an accreting main sequence star .",
    "equation ( [ eq : msms ] ) shows that for the formation of smw jets the mass donor agb star should transfer mass such that the mass slowly flowing in the accretion disk vicinity is about equal to or larger than the mass accreted by the main sequence companion .",
    "this will most likely to occur during a period of very high mass loss rate by the agb star , such that the accretion disk can not ` accept ' all the mass lost by the agb , and a steady state is not reached .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mswd ] ) show that a wd companion can form smw jets when it accretes only few percent of the mass lost by the agb donor , with the condition that the rest of the mass lost by the agb donor slowly flows in the accretion disk vicinity ; here as well a period of high mass transfer rate is required .",
    "@xmath68 carinae is a very massive binary stellar system that underwent a twenty years long eruption , termed the great eruption , about 160 years ago ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) . a massive nebula of @xmath69 ( smith et al .",

    "this can occur , for example , when in a binary system the mass donor star is in eruption , or in a phase of a high mass cooling rate in cooling flow clusters .",
    "the first condition can be expressed as constraint on the ratio of mass flowing to the surrounding of the accretion disk and to the central object .",
    "i derived this condition for progenitors of pns when the mass donor star is an agb star , and the accreting companion is a wd ( eq . [ eq : mswd ] ) and and a main sequence star ( eq .",
    "[ eq : msms ] ) , for the formation of the homunculus ( the bipolar nebula ) of @xmath68 car during the great eruption ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mseta ] ) , and for cooling flow clusters ( eq . [ eq : mscluster ] ) . as evident from these equations ,",
    "most of the mass involved in the process resides in the surrounding of the accretion disk and is eventually expelled from the system . as stated above this requires a non - steady state mass transfer process .",
    "as i discussed in section 2.3 , massive jets better fits the properties of the homunculus in @xmath68 car , and can account for the inflation of fat ( more or less spherical ) bubbles in cooling flow clusters .",
    "the second condition for the formation of smw jets is that the radiative energy losses be small ; this was studied in section 3 .",
    "this implies that the radiative cooling time scale of the shocked ffs jets gas be longer than the acceleration ( flow ) time scale . for pn progenitors with wd accreting companions and in cooling flow clusters",
    "this condition is met by a large margin because the radiative cooling time of optically thin medium in these systems is much longer than the flow time scale . in the case of pn progenitors with main sequence accreting stars ,",
    "this condition is marginal . in that case",
    "it is possible that the ms star itself will directly launched wide jets ( although they can not be massive ) . in the case of the great eruption in @xmath68 car",
    "the medium was optically thick , and the photon diffusion time was about equal to the flow time .",
    "this means that any radiation , whether from the shocked ffs jets material or from the accreting object , will accelerate the smw jets .",
    "however , the ffs jets are required to form the bipolar outflow .",
    "more detail studies of the formation mechanism of smw jets require numerical gasdynamical simulations .",
    "the parameter space of the flow structure studied here is very large .",
    "however , the basic flow structure and the question of whether the mechanism proposed here for the formation of smw jets can work , can be explored with existing numerical codes .",
    "i hope that this preliminary study will motivate deeper search into the formation mechanism(s ) of smw jets .",
