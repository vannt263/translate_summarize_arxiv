    "the string tension @xmath0 is a relevant order parameter to study confinement . while above the deconfinement temperature @xmath1 the simplest order parameter is the polyakov loop , below @xmath1 the expectation value of a single polyakov loop vanishes . below @xmath1 , to study the decrease of confinement with @xmath2 a new order parameter must be used , and we use the string tension .    the existing lattice qcd results for the string tension critical curve have been computed by the bielefeld group @xcite and cardoso et al .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : stringtension ] , who have studied in detail the heavy quark potential , from the color average free energy , at finite temperature in the confined phase .",
    "their results confirmed a first order deconfinement phase transition , as expected for su(3 ) .",
    "bicudo @xcite compared the string tension points obtained by bielefeld group @xcite with different order parameter curves and found empirically that the ferromagnetic critical curve is the one closer to the bielefeld data , fig . [",

    "[ fig : stringtension ] , we show the results for the string tension at finite temperature , for more details see @xcite . near the phase transition , it is necessary to analyse the histogram of the polyakov loop history , if a double peak structure is found in the histogram then there are configurations in the wrong phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig : string_uncorrected ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : string_corrected ] , we show the results with and without those contaminated configurations , respectively .    in this paper we will study the string tension extracted from the singlet energy , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temporal wilson line .",
    "however , this is not gauge invariant and therefore we must fix the gauge . here",
    "we will use the landau gauge fixing using the steepest descent method with fourier acceleration , @xcite . in order to improve the signal - to - noise - ratio",
    ", we apply the multi - hit method before the landau gauge fixing .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the cpu and gpu implementation of the landau gauge fixing algorithm . in section 3 , we show the benchmark results and the string tension results in the landau gauge extracted from the singlet energy . in section 4 ,",
    "we conclude .",
    "the mpi parallel version was implemented in c++ , using the machinery provided by the chroma library @xcite .",
    "the chroma library is built on top of qdp++ , a library which provides a data - parallel programming environment suitable for lattice",
    "the use of qdp++ allows the same piece of code to run both in serial and parallel modes . for the fast fourier transforms , the code uses pfft , a parallel fft library written by michael pippig @xcite .",
    "note that , in order to optimize the interface with the pfft routines , we have compiled qdp++ and chroma using a lexicographic layout .      for the parallel implementation of landau gauge fixing on gpus @xcite , we used version 4.1 of cuda .",
    "for the 4d dimensional lattice , we address one thread per lattice site ; using 3d thread blocks , we only need to reconstruct the other lattice index inside the kernel .",
    "although cuda supports up to 3d thread blocks @xcite , the same does not happen for the grid , which can be up to 2d or 3d depending on the architecture and cuda version .",
    "nevertheless , the code is implemented with 3d thread blocks and for the grid we adapted the code for each situation .",
    "we use the gpu constant memory to put most of the constants needed by the gpu , like the number of points in the lattice , using ` cudamemcpytosymbol ( ) ` . to store the lattice array in global memory",
    ", we use a soa type array as described in @xcite .",
    "the main reason to do this is due to the implementation of the fft algorithm .",
    "the fft is applied for all elements of @xmath5 matrix separately . using the soa type array ,",
    "the fft can be applied directly to the elements without the need of copying data or data reordering . for the fourier transforms",
    ", the code uses cuda cufft @xcite .",
    "since there is no direct support for 4d ffts , we will use 2d plus 2d ffts with ` cufftplanmany ( ) ` .        ' '' ''    ' '' ''    number of gpus & 1 & global memory & 6 gb    ' '' ''    ' '' ''",

    "the string tension is zero and in agreement with the color average free energy .",
    "however , for @xmath14 , the string tension , @xmath12 , show a temperature independent behaviour , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the string tension extracted from the color singlet in landau gauge is constant and temperature independent in the confined phase .",
    "from all the runs using a c2070 tesla gpu , peak performance was measured as 186/71 gflops for single / double precision . from the performance point of view , a run on a single gpu delivers the same performance as the cpu code when running on 32 nodes ( 256 cores ) , if one assumes a linear speed - up behavior .    in the landau gauge ,",
