    "in an electric signal consisting of n pulses , the natural time was introduced@xcite by ascribing to the @xmath4-th pulse the value @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis is then made in terms of the couple ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) where @xmath7 stands for the duration of the @xmath4-th pulse .",
    "the entropy @xmath0 , defined@xcite as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10=@xmath11 and @xmath12 , was found@xcite to distinguish seismic electric signals ( ses ) activities from artificial noises ( an ) , where the latter terminology stands for electrical disturbances which are recorded at a measuring site due to nearby man - made electric sources .",
    "more precisely , ses activities and an have @xmath0-values smaller and larger than that ( @xmath13 ) of a `` uniform '' ( u ) distribution , respectively ( as the latter was defined in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", ion current fluctuations in membrane channels ( icfmc ) have @xmath0 very close to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the fact that a system contains nonlinear components does not necessarily reflect that a specific signal we measure from the system also exhibits nonlinear features .",
    "thus , before analyzing this signal by applying nonlinear techniques , we must first clarify if the use of such techniques is justified by the data available .",
    "the method of surrogate data has been extensively used to serve such a purpose ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "surrogate data refer to data that preserve certain linear statistic properties of the experimental data , but are random otherwise@xcite .",
    "these data are prepared by various procedures ; for example , siwy et al.@xcite in order to study the nature of dwell - time series in icfmc , among other methods , also used surrogate data which have been obtained by three different procedures .",
    "the present paper aims , in general , at presenting a kind of surrogate data analysis using the entropy fluctuations in the natural time - domain ( see below ) as discriminating statistics . throughout the paper ,",
    "the surrogate data are obtained by shuffling the @xmath14 randomly and hence their distribution is conserved .",
    "applying such a procedure , we do the following : consider the null hypothesis that the data consist of _ independent _ draws from a fixed probability distribution of the dwell times ; if we find significantly different serial correlations in the data and their shuffles , we can reject the hypothesis of _ independence _ , see paragraph 3.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the tested null hypothesis is that @xmath14 are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables , i.e. , that there are no correlations between the lengths of consecutive intervals .",
    "if the original ( continuous ) time series is markovian then the null hypothesis for the @xmath14 should hold , i.e. , the @xmath14 are iid .",
    "we emphasize that the terminology `` markovian '' throughout this paper always refers to the original time series .    here , as a measure of the natural time entropy fluctuations we consider the standard deviation @xmath1 when we calculate the value of @xmath0 for a number of consecutive pulses and study how @xmath0 varies when sweeping this time - window through the whole time - series .",
    "we use the following three data sets : two of them are those treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , ses activities and an . as a third one , we preferred to use , instead of icfmc , the case of electrocardiograms ( ecg ) , for several reasons , chief among of which are : ( a ) they are publicly accessible @xcite .",
    "( b ) instead of the single icfmc example , a large variety of ecg are available ( i.e. , 105 individuals are employed here , 10 healthy and 95 patients ) .",
    "( c ) the case of ecg is similar to icfmc , in the sense that the @xmath0-value in ecg results very close to @xmath13 as in icfmc investigated in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the intervals between heart beats fluctuate widely , e.g. , @xcite .    a general agreement about whether or not normal heart dynamics are chaotic or not chaotic is still lacking ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most commonly used non - linear complexity measures are fractal dimensions of various kinds ( e.g. , correlation dimension , renyi dimensions ) .",
    "each of them measures different aspects of the _ statistics _ on the attractor .",
    "on the other hand , liapunov exponents and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy ( k - s entropy ) and entropy rates are measures of the _ dynamics _ on an attractor . except for the k - s",
    "entropy and entropy rates , the other categories of complexity measures assume a purely deterministic system ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since a physiological time series may be due to a mixed process , stochastic and deterministic , the use of fractal dimensions in physiological time series has been occasionally criticized@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "entropy is a concept equally applicable to deterministic as well as stochastic processes .",
    "this is why we preferred to use the entropy in natural time ( more precisely its fluctuations @xmath1 ) as discriminating statistics .",
    "the following point , however , should be stressed .",
    "complexity measures based on _ static",
    "_ entropy ( e.g. , shannon entropy ) quantify _ statistical _ order in the time series .",
    "the underlying key - property of these complexity measures is the probability distribution of the ( dwell times in the ) data analyzed ; thus , the result of such computations should be independent of permutations performed on the ( sequence of the dwell times in the ) time series as in a surrogate ( randomized ) data set obtained by data shuffling",
    ". on the other hand , the entropy in natural time ( and the relevant measures ) considers , from its definition , the _ sequential _ order ( of beats ) ; in other words , @xmath0 is a _ dynamic _ entropy , i.e. , it captures characteristics of the dynamics in a system .",
    "additional comments on the importance of the fluctuations of @xmath0 in ecg will be forwarded in section [ sec5 ] .    in all examples ,",
    "we use a sliding window of length three to ten pulses , except otherwise stated .",
    "concerning the symbols : we reserve @xmath1 _ only _ for the case when the calculation is made by a _",
    "single _ time - window , e.g. , 5 pulses .",
    "the symbol @xmath15 denotes the average of the @xmath1-values calculated for a sequence of single windows , e.g. , 3 , 4 and 5 pulses .",
    "finally , @xmath16 stands for the @xmath1-values averaged over a group of individuals , e.g. , the 10 healthy subjects .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we investigate whether a distinction between ses activities and an can be achieved by the @xmath1-value alone .",
    "furthermore , we examine if @xmath1 can recognize the non - markovianity in all the signals investigated . in section [ sec3 ] , we attempt to shed light on the quantity @xmath2 calculated in a surrogate ( randomized ) data set obtained by data `` shuffling '' .",
    "we find that @xmath2 in ecg is a measure of @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the mean value and the standard deviation of the corresponding intervals , see below ) .",
    "section [ sec4 ] shows that the @xmath2-value differs from @xmath1 , as expected ( cf .",
    "the entropy @xmath0 is _ not _ static entropy , as mentioned above ) .",
    "the prominent role of the ratio @xmath3 in distinguishing ecg of healthy humans from those suffered from sudden cardiac death is shown in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "finally , an appendix is reserved to derive an exact relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath17 when @xmath14 are iid .",
    "we start by examining whether the @xmath1-values alone can distinguish ses activities from an as well as `` recognize '' their non - markovianity .",
    "recall@xcite , that ses and an are time - series of dichotomous nature which are non markovian . in a _ dichotomous _ markovian time - series , the dwell times ( @xmath14 ) are exponentially distributed ; for such a series we plot , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the @xmath1-value versus the time - window length .",
    "( since in the calculation of @xmath0 only ratios of @xmath14 are involved the result does not depend on the transition rates of the markovian process . ) the error shown in this case is on the average 7% .",
    "( the calculation was made for a total number of @xmath20 pulses , see below .",
    "note that this error decreases upon increasing the number of pulses , i.e. , it becomes @xmath21 2% for @xmath22 pulses , which will be used later ) . in the same figure , we insert the @xmath1-values calculated for the four ses activities ( labelled k1 , k2 , a , u ) and the six an ( labelled n1 to n6 ) depicted in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "an inspection of fig.[fig1](a ) reveals the following conclusions .",
    "first , _ no _ distinction between ses activities and an ( both of which have estimation errors comparable to the aforementioned error of the markovian ) is obvious .",
    "an inspection of table i of @xcite , reveals that the number of pulses in three ( out of the four ) ses activities is around @xmath20 , for k2 , u and a ( while for k1 , is @xmath23 ) and this is why we calculated here the markovian case for @xmath20 pulses .",
    "second , concerning the possibility of `` recognizing '' the non - markovianity ( as discussed and shown in refs .",
    "@xcite by independent procedures ) : this could be possibly supported , _ only _ for the shorter time - windows ( i.e. , 3 , 4 and possibly 5 pulses ) for all ses activities as well as for most an ( i.e. , n6 , n4 , n3 , n2 , possibly n1 , but _ not _ for n5 ) , see fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "we now investigate if the @xmath1-values alone can `` recognize '' the non - markovianity in ecg . in a single sinus ( normal ) cycle of an ecg",
    ", the turning points are labelled with the letters p , q , r , s and t. we used here the qt database from physiobank @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which consists of 105 fifteen - minute excerpts of holter recordings as follows : 10 from mit - bih normal sinus rhythm database ( i.e. , healthy subjects , hereafter labelled h ) , 15 from mit - bih arrhythmia database ( mit ) , 13 from mit - bih supraventricular arrhythmia database ( msv ) , 6 from mit - bih st change database ( mst ) , 33 from the european st - t database ( est ) , 4 from mit - bih long - term ecg database ( lt ) and 24 from sudden death patients from bih(sd ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we plot , for the qrs - interval time - series , the @xmath1-value averaged over each of the aforementioned seven groups versus the time - window length . since all time - series of these seven groups have @xmath24 intervals , we insert in the same figure the results calculated for a markovian case ( cf . with the procedure mentioned in the previous paragraph ) of comparable length @xmath24 . we see that the markovian case exhibits @xmath1-values that are roughly one order of magnitude larger than those of the seven groups of humans , which clearly points to the non - markovianity of _ all _ the signals in these groups .",
    "we emphasize that the same conclusions are drawn if we consider , instead of qrs- , the series of qt - intervals , or the beat - to - beat intervals ( rr ) . in summary",

[ fig3](a ) we plot , for each of the 105 individuals , the value of @xmath17 versus the corresponding value of @xmath25 ( time - window range 3 - 10 beats ) for the rr - intervals . the same is repeated in figs . [ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](c ) for the qt- and qrs - intervals , respectively .",
    "all these three plots , can be described by linear behavior and a least squares fitting to a straight line passing through the origin leads to the following slopes : 38.6 @xmath28 0.6 , 36.8 @xmath28 0.2 and 40.1 @xmath28 0.4 , for the rr- , qt- and qrs - intervals , respectively .",
    "this points to the conclusion that @xmath2 provides , as intuitively expected , a measure of @xmath26 .",
    "( this , however , _ can not _ be supported with certainty for the ses activities and an . )",
    "note that , although these three slopes are more or less comparable , they differ by amounts lying outside their standard error . furthermore , it may be worthwhile to mention , that if we study _ altogether _ the rr- , qt- and qrs - intervals , for the 10 healthy humans _ only _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , a good linearity of @xmath26 versus @xmath25 results with a slope 37.5 @xmath28 0.4 .",

    "the origin of this _ common _ behavior merits further investigation .",
    "one could argue that @xmath14 may become iid upon their shuffling . in the appendix ,",

    "the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) reveals that @xmath2 versus @xmath26 must be a straight line with a slope ranging from 34.2 to 40.4 , for a time - window length 3 to 10 .",
    "this result is comparable with the slopes determined above from the analysis of the ecg data .",
    "we first comment on the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the ses activities and an . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the value of @xmath15 versus the corresponding @xmath25 was plotted , for each of the ten signals discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the average values in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) have been calculated over the three time - windows of 3 , 4 and 5 pulses , since we mentioned in section [ sec2 ] that the `` recognition '' of the non - markovianity in all ses activities becomes possible in this time - window range .",
    "if we disregard n6 , and despite the errors of around 5% ( for the time - window range 3 - 5 ) , we may say that there is a systematic tendency pointing to a value of @xmath32 larger than unity ( cf . the same conclusion is drawn , if we take the averages over the time - window range 3 - 10 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the non - markovianity of all these signals , because for a markovian case we expect @xmath25=@xmath15 .",
    "( since , by definition , @xmath2 corresponds to the entropy fluctuations upon _ random _ mixing of @xmath14 , see section [ sec1 ] , it is naturally expected that in a markovian case the two quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ should _ coincide ) .",
    "note that the reverse is _ not _ always true ( thus the equality @xmath25 = @xmath15 may also hold for _ non_-markovian time series ) as will be demonstrated below with precise examples .",
    "we now proceed to compare @xmath2 with @xmath1 in ecg .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) depicts the @xmath15-values , calculated for each of the 105 individuals , versus the corresponding @xmath25 for the rr - intervals ( time - window range 3 - 10 beats ) .",
    "the same is repeated in figs .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) for the qt- and qrs - intervals , respectively . in each case",
    ", we also plot the straight line @xmath25=@xmath15 to visualize that the vast majority of points fall below this line .",
    "the non - equality of @xmath25 and @xmath15 has been also verified by applying the wilcoxon paired signed - rank test recommended@xcite to be followed for non - gaussian paired data .",
    "the tested null hypothesis is that the means of @xmath25 and @xmath15 are the same and is rejected at a level of significance well below 0.01 , since the data of figs .",
    "5(a),(b ) and ( c ) lead to normally distributed variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ( cf . the corresponding one - tailed asymptotic significance is given by @xmath35 , i.e. , the probability to obtain a normally distributed variable which is smaller than @xmath36 ) .",
    "note that a least squares fit to a straight line passing through the origin , results in the following expressions : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 for the figs .",
    "[ fig5](a),[fig5](b ) , [ fig5](c ) , respectively .",
    "the sampling rate @xmath40 in ecg is 250 hz ; thus , if we take as an example the rr - intervals , the experimental error in their allocation is around @xmath41 .",
    "the latter reflects in the calculation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 errors which are drastically smaller than those required to eventually justify a compatibility of the expression @xmath42 , found from fig.[fig5](a ) , with a straight line of slope equal to unity , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in ecg could be understood in the context that the former depends on the _ sequential _ order ( of beats ) , as mentioned in section [ sec1 ] , while the latter does not . since short- ( and long- ) range correlations is a usual feature ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) in heartbeat dynamics , which are possibly destroyed ( or become weaker ) upon randomizing the data , more `` disorder ''",
    "is intuitively expected to appear after randomization , thus reflecting @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , note that in _ all _ the three plots of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] there are some drastic deviations from the straight line @xmath43 . the origin of these deviations is currently investigated in detail .",
    "finally , we further clarify the aforementioned point that the equality @xmath43 does _ not _ necessarily reflect markovianity . in fig.[fig6 ] , we plot , for the qt - intervals , @xmath25 versus @xmath15 ( for time - window range 3 - 10 beats ) for sd and h. we see that there are several individuals ( mainly sd , see also next section ) of which their points lie practically ( i.e. , within the error margins ) on the straight line @xmath43 . if we plot their @xmath1- ( or @xmath2- ) values versus the time - window ( in a similar fashion as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , we find that these values are distinctly smaller than those of the markovian case , thus making clear that these individuals can not be characterized as exhibiting markovian behavior .",
    "( this non - markovianity holds for _ all _ h and _ all _ sd . )",
    "here we focus only on two groups of ecg , namely h and sd , and examine whether they can be distinguished by means of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "we calculate this ratio , for each type of interval , at two ranges : ( i ) a short ( s ) range 3 - 4 beats ( cf . consider that the _ smallest _ number allowed for the natural time - domain analysis is 3 beats ) and ( ii ) a longer ( l ) range 50 - 70 beats . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath46 , and hence the following ratios are investigated : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the type of interval ( i.e. , @xmath49=rr , qrs or qt ) and @xmath50 refer to the range studied ( i.e. , @xmath51 3 - 4 beats and @xmath52=50 - 70 beats ) .",
    "the calculated values for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the three types of intervals are given , for all h and sd , in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the minima @xmath53 $ ] and maxima @xmath54 $ ] ( where @xmath55 denotes either the short , @xmath56 , or the longer , @xmath57 , range ) among the healthy subjects are also inserted in two separate rows , for each type of interval and each range studied . these minima and maxima are labeled @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the cases of sd which have smaller and larger values than @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( reported in each column ) are marked with superscripts `` a '' and `` b '' respectively .",
    "a careful inspection of table [ tab1 ] leads to the following main conclusion : _ all _ sd violate one or more h - limits ( i.e. , they have values that are smaller than @xmath58 or larger than @xmath59 ) .",
    "we intentionally emphasize that this conclusion is also drawn _ even _ when disregarding the results for the qt - intervals .",
    "( concerning the latter intervals : only 5 sd out of 24 violate the h - limits ; however , in _ all _ sd , their @xmath1-values themselves are larger than those in h , see also fig .",
    "the usefulness of this difference will be discussed in detail elsewhere ) . in other words , when focusing our investigation solely on the rr- and qrs - intervals , _ all _ sd violate one or more of the four h - limits related to @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "specifically , concerning @xmath60 , 15 sd have values smaller than @xmath66 , while only one sd ( i.e. , sel43 ) has a value exceeding @xmath67 ; as for @xmath61 , 18 sd exceed @xmath68 , while only 2 sd ( i.e. , sel34 and sel42 ) have values smaller than @xmath69 .    in what remains , we proceed to a tentative physical interpretation of the above results , the main feature of which focuses on the fact that most sd simultaneously have @xmath60-values smaller than @xmath70 and @xmath61-values exceeding @xmath71 .",
    "the rr time - series of healthy subjects are characterized by high complexity ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; this , if we recall that in a markovian series we intuitively expect @xmath72 ( and hence @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , is compatible with the fact that in _ all _ h _ both _ @xmath60 and @xmath61 distinctly differ from unity ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we now turn to sd by considering that for individuals at high risk of sudden death the fractal physiological organization ( long range correlations ) breaks down and this is often accompanied by emergence of _ uncorrelated randomness _",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore naturally expected that in sd the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 become closer to the markovian value ( i.e. , unity ) compared to h ; thus , in sd , @xmath60 naturally becomes smaller than the value 1.18 ( the corresponding @xmath58-limit ) and @xmath61 larger than 0.77 ( the corresponding @xmath59-limit ) .",
    "we now focus on the following important property of h : although _ both _ @xmath60 and @xmath61 differ from unity , as mentioned , they systematically behave _ differently _ , i.e. , @xmath75 while @xmath76 .",
    "the exact origin of the latter difference has not yet been identified with certainty , but the following comments might be relevant : first , in the frame of the frequency - domain characteristics of heart rate variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we may state that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are associated with the high - frequency ( hf , 0.15 - 0.4 hz ) and low - frequency ( lf , 0.015 - 0.15 hz ) range in the rr tachogram ( `` instantaneous '' heart rate,1/rr ) .",
    "an important difference on the effect of the sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of the rr - intervals has been noticed ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) : sympathetic tone is believed to influence the lf component whereas _ both _ sympathetic and parasympathetic activity have an effect on the hf component ( recall that our results show @xmath77 ) .",
    "second , at short time scales ( high frequencies ) , it has been suggested @xcite that we have relatively _ smooth _ heartbeat oscillations associated with respiration ( e.g. , 15 breaths per minute corresponds to a 4 sec oscillation with a peak in the power spectrum at 0.25 hz , see @xcite ) ; this is lost upon randomizing the consecutive intervals @xmath14 , thus probably leading to ( larger variations -compared to the original experimental data- between the durations of consecutive intervals and hence to ) @xmath2-values larger than @xmath1 , i.e. , a @xmath60-value larger than unity ( cf .",
    "an extension of the current analysis to a surrogate sequence for a simultaneous recording of the breath rate and the instantaneous heart rate , upon considering the points discussed in paragraph 4.6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , could greatly contribute towards clarifying the validity of such an explanation ) .",
    "such an argument , if true , can not be applied , of course , in the longer range 50 - 70 beats and hence explain why the opposite behavior , i.e. , @xmath78 , then holds .",
    "the latter finding must be inherently connected to the nature itself of the long range correlations .",
    "the existence of the latter is pointed out from the fact that ( in this range also ) the rr - intervals result in @xmath1-values ( @xmath79 ) which significantly differ from the markovian @xmath1-value ( @xmath80 ) ( cf .",
    "the existence of the long range correlations in the heart rate variability has been independently established by several applications of the detrended fluctuation analysis , e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a simplified interpretation of the results of fig.[fig6 ] , and in particular the reason why for the qt intervals the quantity @xmath1 is larger for the sd than for the h , could be attempted if we consider that : ( i ) @xmath0 could be thought as a measure of the `` disorder '' ( in the consecutive intervals ) ( ii ) the essence of the natural time - domain analysis is built on the variation of the durations of consecutive pulses , and ( iii ) it has been clinically observed ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite ) that the qt interval ( which corresponds to the time in which the heart in each beat `` recovers '' -electrically speaking- from the previous excitation ) exhibits frequent prolonged values before cardiac death .",
    "thus , when a time - window is sliding on an h - ecg , it is intuitively expected to find , more or less , the same @xmath0-values ( when sweeping through various parts of the ecg ) and hence a small @xmath1-value is envisaged . by the same token , in an sd - ecg , we expect that , in view of the short - long - short sequences of the qt - intervals , the corresponding @xmath0-values will be much different ( compared to h ) , thus leading to a larger @xmath1-value ( cf . in the same frame we may also understand why the @xmath17 values -and hence @xmath2 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq1])- are larger in sd than those in h , as shown in fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "the distinction between sd and h could be also understood in the context of dynamic phase - transitions ( critical phenomena ) , as follows : in sd , since the dynamic phase transition ( cardiac arrest ) is approached , the _ fluctuations _ of @xmath0 are expected to become larger , thus reflecting larger @xmath1 ; such intense fluctuations are not expected , of course , for h.",
    "the main point emerged in the surrogate data analysis presented in this paper , is the key - role of the quantity @xmath81 .",
    "this ratio :    \\1 . reveals the non - markovianity in all three types of signals analyzed here , i.e. , ses activities , an and ecg .",
    "in a markovian case we have @xmath82 , but the reverse is not always valid ; it may happen that @xmath83 , although @xmath1- ( and @xmath2- ) value drastically differ from that of the markovian ( this is the case of ecg ) .",
    "\\2 . differentiates the ecg of healthy humans ( h ) from those suffered from sudden cardiac death ( sd ) .",
    "more precisely , in sd , the @xmath3 values of the rr ( i.e. beat to beat ) intervals become closer to the markovian value ( i.e. , unity ) compared to those in h. furthermore , in sd , _ both _ @xmath1 -and @xmath2- values of the qt interval ( corresponding to the time in which the heart `` recovers '' from its previous excitation ) are larger than those in h.    as for the physical meaning of @xmath2 in ecg , it was shown to be a measure of @xmath17 .",
    "if we consider a time - series @xmath14 , where @xmath85 , we obtain the quantities @xmath86 , which satisfy the necessary conditions@xcite : @xmath87 to be considered as point probabilities .",
    "we then define@xcite the moments of the natural time @xmath88 as @xmath89 and the entropy @xmath8 , where @xmath90 .",
    "this appendix is solely focused on a uniform distribution in the natural time - domain .",
    "we now consider the case when @xmath14 are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) positive random variables .",
    "it then follows that the expectation value @xmath91 $ ] of @xmath10 equals @xmath92 : @xmath93 equation ( [ a1 ] ) results from the fact that , since @xmath14 are iid , we have : @xmath94=1=n \\text{e}(p_k)$ ] . for the purpose of our calculations the relation between the variance of @xmath10 , @xmath95 $ ] , and the covariance of @xmath10 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 $ ] ,",
