    "this invited review deals with this apparent new class of x - ray sources which show intrinsically high absorption along the line of sight , i.e. , orders of magnitude higher than the usual interstellar absorption .",
    "i will describe their properties , and discuss their nature .",
    "_ integral _ carries on - board four instruments : spi , a hard x - ray/@xmath0-ray spectrometer ; ibis , two coded mask hard x - ray/@xmath0-ray imagers , isgri and picsit ; jem - x , two identical coded mask x - ray imagers ; omc , an optical monitor .",

    "it has a 8.3@xmath7x8@xmath7 fully - coded field - of - view , while it is partially coded out to 29@xmath7x29@xmath7 ; the angular resolution is 12. this makes it ideal for observations in crowded regions .",
    "the large field - of - view of ibis makes it ideal to map the hard x - ray/@xmath0-ray sky . during the first year of galactic plane observations",
    "about 120 point sources were detected down to @xmath81mcrab ( 30100kev ; bird et al .",

    "about 86%  of the galactic hard x - ray emission up to @xmath3100kev can be attributed to these high - energy point sources ( lebrun et al .",
    "as an illustration of the usefulness of the combination of a large field - of - view and high sensitivity at hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-rays , _ integral _ discovered its first source , igrj16318@xmath44848 , soon after nominal operation started , on january 29 , 2003 during a routine galactic plane scan ( courvoisier et al .",
    "re - analysis of archival _ asca _ data revealed that its position coincides with a highly absorbed ( @xmath9@xmath310@xmath10@xmath2 ) source with some hint of an fe emission line ( murukami et al .",
    "2003 , revnitsev et al .  2003 ) .",
    "two weeks after the _ integral _ detection , an _ xmm - newton _ too observation indeed unveiled a variable and heavily absorbed source ( 2@xmath1110@xmath10@xmath2 ) , which emitted strong emission lines ( schartel et al .",
    "the emission complex could be resolved into three components , with centroid energies of 6.4kev , 7.1kev and 7.5kev .",

    "after igrj16318@xmath44848 , _ integral _ found many more new sources ( hereafter called igr sources ) .",
    "up to april 2005 more than 50 of these igr sources have been reported.rodrigue/html/igrsources.html for an up - to - date list and further information . ]",
    "some were identified with already known sources ( e.g. , igrj17464@xmath43213 = h1743@xmath4322 ) , but most of them are new ones .",
    "about one third of the igr sources can be classified .",
    "most of them are either persistent or transient low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) or high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "some of them have been classified as either being cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , igr j17303@xmath40601 ) , accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( igrj00291 + 5934 ) , agn ( e.g. , igrj18027@xmath41455 ) , or the central source of our galaxy , sgra@xmath14 ( igrj17456@xmath42901 ) .",
    "still , about two third of them are unclassified , and some work lies ahead of us . the distribution of these sources is shown in fig .",
    "it seems that they are all distributed along the galactic plane , with concentrations in the direction of the galactic center and galactic arms ( see , e.g. , lutovinov et al .",
    "one must note , however , that a lot of the _ integral _ observations are concentrated on regions around the galactic plane and the detection of new ( especially transient ) sources may , therefore , be biased towards these regions .    of the ( up to now well - studied ) igr sources ,",
    "ten of them show very strong absorption ( n@xmath15@xmath510@xmath1@xmath2 ) , i.e. , one to two orders of magnitude higher than the galactic value of around 10@xmath16@xmath2 .",
    "it is this class of sources which i concentrate on for the rest of this paper , and i will refer to them as highly absorbed igr sources .",
    "they are listed in table 1 ; one thing which immediately catches the eye is that all but one ( igrj19140 + 0951 ) are in the direction of the norma - arm tangent region .",

    "note that various other of the less absorbed igr sources are classified as bonafide hmxb / be - x - ray transients ( see , e.g. , negueruela 2005 ) .",
    "there are a few well - known hmxbs which show strong ( n@xmath15@xmath510@xmath1@xmath2 ) and variable absorption , as well as strong fek@xmath12 emission and x - ray pulsations : gx301@xmath42 ( swank et al .  1976 , endo et al .",
    "2002 ) , vela  x-1 ( haberl &  white 1990 ) , xtej0421 + 56 ( cicam ; boirin et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the latter is an atypical be / x - ray binary ( see below ) .",
    "note that gx1 + 4 , not an hmxb but a rare type of symbiotic lmxb ( see below ) , showed also similar spectra during an extended low state ( naik et al .",

    "see also walter 2005 ; 4u1909 + 07 : levine et al .",

    "for example , in gx302@xmath41 the absorption varies between 3@xmath1110@xmath1 and 2@xmath1110@xmath10@xmath2 , and is indeed connected to its 41  day orbit ( e.g. , white &  swank 1984 , endo et al .",
    ".    long x - ray ` pulse ' periods have been found previously in hmxbs ( but in those which show only moderate x - ray absorption ) , such as saxj2239.3 + 6116 ( 21min : in t zand et al .",

    "4u2206 + 54 and 4u0114 + 650 shows noticeable similar pulsation profiles as those seen in the highly absorbed igr sources . most of the x - ray pulsar hmxbs with pulse period longer than typically a few minutes are considered to be pulsars fed by a stellar wind ( e.g. , nagase 1989 ) . in the classical corbet ( 1986 )",
    "diagram the highly absorbed igr sources either fall in the group of supergiant systems or the long orbital period ( @xmath530days ) be / x - ray transients .",
    "so far , only igrj19140 + 0951 has a reported orbital period ( p@xmath25@xmath813.55days , corbet et al .",
    "they argued that even extremely small amounts of accretion can spin up the star to shorter periods than those observed . the only way out might be a pulsar in a be / x - ray binary , which is able to spin down due to the propellor effect during the long quiescence period in between outbursts .",
    "interestingly , the pulsations seen in 4u0114 + 650 have been interpreted as pulsations from its early b star donor ( finley et al .",
    "if the highly absorbed igr sources indeed contain ( slow ) pulsars , their compact object is evidently a neutron star .",
    "however , if this interpretation is not correct , a black hole can not be excluded either ( this is especially true for those igr sources with no identified pulsations ) .",
    "the presence of strong absorption in the x - ray domain shows that the compact object must be embedded in a dense circumstellar envelope , originating from a dense stellar wind from the donor .",
    "this ( relatively cold ) envelope also serves as the source of the fluorescent emission , especially in igrj16318@xmath44848 ( e.g. , walter et al .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "about 70%  of the mass donors in hmxb are classical be stars , the rest are blue supergiants . a big fraction of the accretion powered x - ray pulsars in the be - systems are transients .",
    "be stars show rich emission line their spectra .",
    "there is , however , a subclass of objects which also show forbidden lines , as well as a near - ir excess .",
    "these are the b[e ] stars ; they include many objects of different types and evolutionary status ( e.g. , lamers et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the typical mass - loss rates in these stars are m@xmath510@xmath26m@xmath27yr@xmath24 .",
    "a few of the highly absorbed igr sources have been identified in the optical and/or ir .",
    "the ir spectra of igrj16318@xmath44848 are rich in emission lines , i.e. , various order h - lines , hei and ii , low excitation permitted lines , as well as forbidden iron lines ; some lines show p - cygni profiles ( filliatre &  chaty 2004 ) .",
    "many of these ir spectral lines can be identified in xtej0421 + 56 too ( see clark et al .",
    "1999 ) . for both xtej0421 + 56 ( e.g. , clark et al .  1999 ,",
    "hynes et al .  2002 ) and igrj16318@xmath44848 ( filliatre &  chaty 2004 ) it has been suggested that they have a supergiant b[e ] donor present in a dense and absorbing circumstellar environment .",
    "comparable ir spectra are also seen in gx1 + 4 .",
    "its donor is , however , a cool giant star , and the ir spectra show in addition late - type features , such as co - bands ( clark et al .",
    "these features are not seen in either xtej0421 + 56 or igrj16318@xmath44848 .",
    "the donor in igrj16465@xmath44507 has also been suggested to be an ( early ) supergiant ( smith 2004 ) , whereas in igrj16320@xmath44751 it is either a cool giant or supergiant ( rodriguez et al .",
    "early - type stars are also found in the error circles for some of the other highly ir absorbed sources .",
    "the near - ir excess in b[e ] stars points to the presence of hot circumstellar dust .",
    "both in igrj16320@xmath44751 ( rodriguez et al .  2003 ) and igrj16465@xmath44507 ( smith 2004 ) there is evidence for such a near - ir excess .",
    "the ir spectra of igrj16318@xmath44848 suggest a similar configuration ( filliatre &  chaty 2004 ) .",
    "the column density derived from the optical extinction is found to be one to two orders of magnitude less than that derived from the x - ray measurements ( igrj16318@xmath44848 : walter et al .",

    "; igrj16465@xmath44507 : smith 2004 ) .",
    "this suggests that the dense circumstellar envelope must be rather compact and concentrated towards the compact object ( e.g. , revnivtsev et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "soft x - ray excess emission between 0.3 and 5kev has been reported for igrj16318@xmath44848 ( when fitting the observed x - ray spectrum with a power - law spectrum to standard absorption column , see footnote on page 4 ) .",
    "it seems to be consisting of two parts , one above and one below @xmath32kev .",
    "partial covering could account for the excess between @xmath325kev .",
    "if the covering fraction is less than 1 , part of the x - ray illuminated surface should be directly visible , producing a compton reflection component ( matt &  guainazzi 2003 , matt et al .  2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is not clear whether such a component is present or not ( walter et al .",
    "2003 , matt &  guainazzi 2003 ) .",
    "the excess between 0.32kev could not be easily explained ( matt &  guainazzi 2003 ) .",
    "hints of a soft x - ray excess are seen as well in igrj16320@xmath44751 ( rodriguez et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "there is evidence for an ( independent ) soft component in the x - ray spectrum of xtej0421 + 56 in outburst , subsequent decay , and quiescence , below a few kev ( boirin et al .",
    "2002 , ishida et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "a similar feature is seen in the soft x - ray spectrum of chcyg , a symbiotic star containing a white dwarf ( chcyg ; ezuka et al .",
    "1998 ) . modeling the parts below and above @xmath32kev as separate emission components ( ezuka et al .  1998 ; ishida et al .  2004 ) , or modeling the emission with a partial covering absorption model ( e.g. , boirin et al .  2002 ) seemed to work fine .",
    "because of the similarity with chcyg , it was proposed that xtej0421 + 56 contains a white dwarf ( ishida et al .",
    "2004 ) ; this is , however , hard to reconcile with the observed x - ray properties of xtej0421 + 56 ( e.g. , hynes et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) and igrj16318@xmath44848 .",
    "it is interesting to note that soft x - ray spectra during x - ray dips in the light curves of lmxbs and hmxbs also show an excess in emission below typically 4kev ( see , e.g. , kuulkers et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "such dips are thought to be due to strong absorption ( up to a few 10@xmath1@xmath2 ) of emission from the inner parts of the accretion disk and compact object by the cooler outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "wheatley ( 2001 ) showed that the soft x - ray spectrum of chcyg can be solely described by emission from the white dwarf which is strongly absorbed by a partionally ionised wind from the red giant . recently , a partionally ionised absorber has been proposed as well to explain the soft x - ray spectra during the dips in lmxbs ( boirin et al .",
    "2005 ) . since the soft spectral properties of xtej0421 + 56 and",
    "igr16318@xmath44848 are very similar to chcyg , it is logical to suggest such a model for these sources as well .",
    "the strong emission from the compact object is able to ionize the immediate environment .",
    "such a ionised region can be responsible for , e.g. , the observed ir heii emission in xtej0421 + 56 and igr16318@xmath44848 .",
    "if this works , than there may not be a need for a compton reflection component and one can conclude that the whole x - ray emitting region is covered by the circumstellar material .",
    "the above described x - ray and optical / ir properties suggests that the highly absorbed igr sources are hmxbs containing either a neutron star or black hole in orbit around a ( super)giant donor .",
    "the stellar wind accreting onto the compact object could form a dense envelope in which absorption , fluoresence and ionization takes place .",
    "this circumstellar envelope does not seem to cover much of the ( super)giant donor .",
    "because of the wavelength window _",
    "integral _ is able to observe , we are now starting to find more of this previously poorly known class of sources .",
    "indeed , thanks to integral `` we can see clearly now ... '' ( white 2004 ) .",
