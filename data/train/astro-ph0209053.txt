    "radiatively driven diffusion processes are generally accepted to be responsible for chemical peculiarities observed among upper main sequence cp stars @xcite .",
    "the upward radiative acceleration and downward gravity acting on different chemical species compete and drive their microscopic diffusion , resulting in the stratification of these elements in the stellar atmospheres or envelopes of these stars .",
    "if these atmospheres are sufficiently stable , chemical inhomogeneities can persevere , and are not wiped out by various mixing processes such as convective zones , stellar winds or rotationally induced mixing . in the particular case of hgmn star atmospheres ,",
    "temperatures are high enough for hydrogen to be largely ionized , thus removing its convection zone .",
    "also , if the he ionization convection zone diminishes due to he settling in late b stars rotating slower than _ c. _ 75 kms@xmath4 @xcite , diffusion can operate very effectively in the atmosphere .",
    "this is the case for hgmn stars as they are also known as slow rotators .",
    "such diffusion processes are generally time dependent problems , but the characteristic time - scales in the atmosphere are much shorter than in the envelope ( @xmath5 yr ) due to the considerable lower density , smaller collision rates and higher diffusion velocities ( _ c._1cms@xmath4 ) .",
    "this makes the time dependent calculations extremely difficult .",
    "so far , diffusion can be followed in time only in the envelope , as shown in the case of neon by @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these calculations suggest that radiative accelerations on ne are much lower than gravity below the atmosphere and ne should sink and be observed as underabundant unless a weak stellar wind transports upwards the ne accumulated in deep layers .",
    "nevertheless , observations are restricted to the atmospheres .",
    "this important stellar region bridges the effects in the envelopes with those outside the stars , such as stellar winds , and one clearly needs also to know the radiative accelerations here in order to compare the theory with observations .",
    "the case of ne is worth studying for two reasons : it is an important element having very high standard abundance @xcite of about a(ne / h)=@xmath6 , and because one can expect similar effects as in the case of he .",
    "( along with hei ) has a very high ionization potential and first excited level well above the ground state .",
    "is thus the dominant ionization state in the atmospheres of these stars and all  resonance lines are in the lyman continuum .",
    "this part of the spectrum is very sensitive to non - lte ( nlte ) effects and the temperature structure of the atmosphere .",
    "it is known that there is a big difference in the temperature behaviour between lte and nlte model atmospheres at small optical depths and that temperature can rise outwards in the nlte models .",
    "is also known to have strong nlte effects on lines originating from excited levels in the visible part of the spectrum even in late b - type main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "thus , the main complication is clear in doing the task .",
    "one can not rely upon the diffusion approximation when calculating energy flux as this is a non - local quantity in the atmosphere , in contrast to envelope calculations .",
    "one needs to solve the radiative transfer as , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , including nlte effects if possible .",
    "unfortunately , observations of ne in hgmn stars are very scarce and apart from recent lte ne abundances in @xmath7cnc , hr7245 and hd29647 by @xcite and @xcite the only study of ne was undertaken recently by @xcite . their nlte analysis of 20 hgmn and 5 normal stars revealed that ne is clearly underabundant in hgmn stars and the deficit reaches its peak values in the middle of the  domain of hgmn stars .",
    "in this paper we deal with the radiative accelerations of neon in the atmosphere . this might enable us to model the vertical element stratification in the future , e.g. considering the atmosphere as being in a sequence of stationary states which are to be tailored to the much more slowly varying envelope as proposed by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some conclusions can be drawn already from the radiative accelerations alone . in the following , cgs units and lte approximations ( in a nlte atmosphere model )",
    "are used if not specified otherwise .",
    "the physics and calculations of radiative accelerations in the envelopes are clearly explained in @xcite , recent improvements are described in @xcite and some theoretical aspects are discussed in @xcite .",
    "our approach to the problem of calculating accelerations in the atmospheres is described here .",
    "radiative acceleration on the element is due to the momentum transferred to the element ions from photons absorbed via bound - bound , bound - free and free - free transitions .",
    "bound - bound transitions are usually the most important .",
    "an expression for the radiative acceleration on the ion @xmath8 through its spectral lines can be derived from the radiative transfer equation . for a particular spectral line in the case of complete redistribution",
    "we have : @xmath9h \\nu   \\varphi_{lu}(\\nu)ds \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where the three terms describe spontaneous isotropic emission , absorption , and stimulated emission , respectively .",
    "note that stimulated emission is in the direction of the photon absorbed . here ,",
    "and in the following , @xmath10 is monochromatic intensity , @xmath11 is monochromatic energy flux , @xmath12 is the energy of the transition from the lower level @xmath13 to the upper level @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the normalized voigt profile , @xmath16 is the rosseland optical depth , @xmath17 is the distance along the beam , @xmath18 is the nlte population of the @xmath13-th state of @xmath8-th ion , @xmath19 is the total nlte @xmath8-th ion population , @xmath20 are b - factors defined as a ratio of nlte to lte level population ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 is the mass of the @xmath8-th ion , @xmath23 is the speed of light , @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath25 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath26 are the einstein coefficients where @xmath27 is related to the oscillator strength @xmath28 and @xmath29 by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the electron charge and mass respectively and @xmath32 are statistical weights of the lower and upper levels . introducing the vertical geometrical depth @xmath33 , multiplying eq .",
    "[ e1 ] by @xmath34 and integrating through all solid angles @xmath35 we get for the radiation pressure gradient @xmath36 : @xmath37 if @xmath38 is the momentum removed from the radiation field through one spectral line in unit volume and @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the corresponding accelerations acquired by the ion @xmath8 then we get : @xmath41 @xmath42 the sum runs through all @xmath43 transitions in the ion .",

    "the above expression for radiative acceleration includes the correction for stimulated emission which is often omitted by other authors , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , but does not include the redistribution effect pointed out by @xcite and generalized to include gravity by @xcite .",
    "it has been substantially revisited by @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the redistribution effect is that , after the photon absorption , ion @xmath8 is in the excited state @xmath14 and has non - negligible probability @xmath48 of being ionized ( mainly by collisions with fast electrons ) before losing its momentum ( mainly by collisions with protons ) . the probability of its remaining in the state @xmath8 is @xmath49 as the probability of recombination or further ionization is negligible .",
    "momentum absorbed during the transition in the state @xmath8 , @xmath38 , should then be redistributed to the two mass reservoirs @xmath50 and @xmath51 of @xmath52 and @xmath8 ions in the proportions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "consequently , one gets : .",
    "other formulae for the redistribution effect without @xmath53 factor would also hold but if combined with a slightly different definition of radiative acceleration , e.g. that of @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 the redistribution function , @xmath49 , depends on the ionization rate from the particular level , @xmath56 , and the collision rate of the ion , @xmath57 : @xmath58 it is often useful to picture the radiative accelerations on many ions being applied via some effective radiative acceleration on the element as a whole .",
    "consequently , to compare the results with other authors and to display them , we also calculated the weighted mean radiative acceleration ( although the results are stored for each ion and abundance separately ) .",
    "we adopted the following expression suggested by @xcite : @xmath59 @xmath60 is obtained from @xmath61 , which are diffusion coefficients which describe the diffusion of the @xmath8-th ion in neutral and ionized hydrogen , respectively : @xmath62 for the diffusion of the @xmath8-th ion ( excluding neutral ) in protons we used @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the proton number density , @xmath65 is the ionization degree ( 0 = neutral , ... ) and : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is atomic weight in atomic mass units and : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is debye length and @xmath70 is electron number density . for the diffusion of neutrals in protons we used @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the polarizability of neutral species ( @xmath73 @xmath74 for  and respectively , from @xcite ) .",
    "the same formula was used for the diffusion of ions in neutral hydrogen with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the neutral hydrogen number density .",
    "for the diffusion of neutrals in neutral hydrogen we used @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 are  and diffusing atom diameters , respectively .",
    "the following values calculated using the method of @xcite were adopted : @xmath80 .",
    "as one goes from the envelope higher into the atmosphere , the electron density and associated stark broadening drop sharply and the spectral lines become much narrower .",
    "one needs to consider fine structure to integrate properly the contributions from bound - bound transitions .",
    "atomic data for the nei - iv lines were extracted from the kurucz line list ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cdrom 23 ) .",
    "however , one usually does not need to consider all the lines of the element and it is of high practical importance to select just the most important ones .",
    "lines which are important for a particular atmosphere model were selected in the following way .    for practical purposes",
    "it is convenient to ascribe three characteristic rosseland optical depths @xmath81 or characteristic temperatures @xmath82 to each ion @xmath8 of the element of interest .",
    "the range @xmath83 to @xmath84 spans the region where the ion @xmath8 is sufficiently populated and its contribution to the total radiative acceleration of the element is thus not negligible , while @xmath85 is the approximate temperature at which the ion dominates the element and the @xmath8-th ion opacity is maximal . for each line @xmath86 of the ion @xmath8",
    "two parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 were calculated which correspond to two characteristic temperatures @xmath89 : @xmath90\\ ] ] @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the excitation potential of the lower level and : @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the planck function , @xmath96 is the effective temperature , and @xmath97 the approximate continuous opacity after @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath98 is essentially a rough estimate of the expected radiative acceleration through weak lines , as eq.[e20 ] takes only opacity in the continuum into account and partition functions are set to 1 . or radiative accelerations for all the lines of a particular ion are scaled by the same value of ion population which is proportional to its partition function .",
    "again , it also means we can not omit important lines .",
    "] then we calculate a sum @xmath99 through all the lines of the @xmath8-th ion and skip the lines which do not contribute significantly to the sum .",
    "we ended up with about 10@xmath100 ne lines for a particular model atmosphere .    to evaluate numerically the integral in eq .",
    "[ e6 ] it is necessary to estimate the integration step and integration boundaries .",
    "thermal doppler broadening at the coolest layer and classical radiative damping put constraints on the width of any spectral line and we use minimum frequency spacings equal to @xmath101 where : @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "integration boundaries are associated with our line width , which is generally the broadest at the place of highest electron density due to stark broadening and we use : @xmath104 \\label{e21f}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the sum of the radiative , stark and van der waals damping parameters . here",
    ", @xmath106 is an adjustable constant for which numerical tests revealed that @xmath107 is high enough .",
    "this is , however , just the case of a weak line .",
    "if the opacity in the center of our line is much greater than the opacity in the continuum one must usually integrate much further until the line opacity drops significantly below continuum .",
    "the reason why is apparent if one expresses the flux in eq.[e6 ] following the diffusion approximation and neglects continuum opacity ; it is inversely proportional to the voigt function .",
    "consequently , the integrand in eq.[e6 ] is a constant function of frequency .",
    "only when the integration is carried far enough into the line wing , where continuum opacity again dominates , does flux approach a constant function of frequency and the integrand sharply fall . finally , the integration boundaries should be the maximum value of the mentioned effects : @xmath108 \\label{e21b}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is defined for strong lines only and is @xmath110 for which the line opacity drops significantly below the continuum opacity at the depth where the involved ion population reaches its peak values .",
    "typically , anything from 40 to 10@xmath100 frequency points were necessary to calculate the radiative acceleration through a ne line .",
    "the models adopted here were nlte model atmospheres calculated with tlusty195 @xcite for standard solar composition and zero microturbulence .",
    "we treated , hei , heii , ci , cii , ciii as explicit ions , which means that their level populations were solved in nlte under the assumption of statistical equilibrium and their bound - bound , bound - free , and free - free opacities were taken into account .",

    "the first is a strong resonance line in the lyman continuum and the second is in the paschen continuum in the visible .",
    "abundance analyses of ne have been performed using @xmath1116402 @xcite .",

    "this enabled us to take into account the bound - free and free - free opacity from explicit levels specified in the atmosphere model and the line blending using the full line list of @xcite .",

    "but above @xmath2g@xmath3 strong departures of ne ionization and excitation equilibrium from lte occur @xcite and our accelerations on different ne ions should be considered as approximate above this level ( see fig.[f8 ] for an illustration of expected deviations from fully consistent nlte case )",
    ".    accelerations in the representative model are plotted in fig .",
    "one can see that none of them exceeds the gravitational acceleration except at the very deepest layers .",
    "the acceleration on  is strongest in the atmosphere where this ion is also most populated .",
    "the contribution of the neutral species like  to the total effective radiative acceleration of the element is both favoured by weighting with their diffusion coefficient ( see eq .",
    "[ e10 ] ) which is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that for the charged species and reduced by the redistribution effect",
    ". nevertheless , acceleration of  will be the most important contribution to the total acceleration not only in the atmosphere but also at rather great depth up to @xmath125g@xmath3 .",
    "the low radiative accelerations found on  are a consequence of its atomic structure because all resonance transitions , which are usually the most important , are in the lyman continuum where  atoms see little photon flux , while the rest of the lines originate from highly excited and weakly populated states .",
    "nor can the redistribution effect discussed earlier increase the ne i acceleration ( see eq .",
    "[ e8 ] and fig .",
    "[ f6b ] ) ; just the opposite occurs .",
    "radiative acceleration gained in the  state is redistributed between  and , which reduces the  acceleration and adds it to the  state where , however , the acceleration is not so effective due to the much lower diffusion coefficient of ionized species ; see eqs .",
    "[ e7 ] , [ e10 ] .",
    "we would like to stress that radiative acceleration ( eq . [ e6 ] ) on a particular ion is very sensitive to the partition functions .",
    "these are generally precise in the region where the ion dominates the element but have large uncertainties outside the region .",
    "displaying effective accelerations overcomes the problem as partition functions drop out in eq .",
    "[ e10 ] outside the region .",
    "thus , if the reader wishes to use our radiative accelerations stored separately for each ion , the same partition functions should be used also .",
    "now we can proceed further and explore how the situation changes with the effective temperature of the star .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ f4 ] that the total acceleration rapidly increases with the effective temperature",
    ". however , within our range of interest it never exceeds the gravity in the line forming region .",
    "nevertheless , this suggests that ne could accumulate at deeper layers in cooler stars than in hotter ones , the latter thus being more vulnerable to departures from the ideal stable atmosphere .",
    "various mixing processes or radiatively driven stellar winds whose intensity also increases with the effective temperature @xcite might more easily enrich ne in the atmospheres of much hotter stars . this resembles the case of he which has atomic structure similar to ne .",
    "the abundance of he progressively increases with effective temperature from he - weak towards he - rich stars .",
    "this suggests that it might be interesting to search for ne - rich analogues of he - rich stars among early b stars . on the other hand , for @xmath126k",
    ", hydrogen becomes partially ionized , which triggers ambipolar diffusion and hydrogen superficial convective zones .",
    "this may also transport some ne to the atmosphere from below .",
    "our observations @xcite indicate that ne underabundances are most pronounced in the middle of the hgmn domain and tend to be less extreme towards the cool and hot ends of the hgmn temperature region .",
    "this pattern could therefore be qualitatively expected .",
    "observing ne below @xmath127k , however , becomes very difficult .",
    "the radiative accelerations also depend on the surface gravity ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . lowering the surface gravity of the model shifts the radiative acceleration behaviour to deeper layers and reduces the radiative acceleration at the bottom of the atmosphere .",
    "however , the gravity to radiative acceleration ratio does not change very much and in this context effective temperature is a more important atmospheric parameter than @xmath128 .",
    "apparently , within the main sequence ( approximately @xmath129 ) , radiative acceleration of ne never overcomes gravity .",
    "radiative acceleration on the element also depends on its abundance .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that the energy flux in the integral in eq .",
    "[ e6 ] depends on the element abundance .",
    "this is , however , only important in the case of strong lines where the line opacity is comparable to or larger than opacity in the continuum .",
    "one can then expect that radiative acceleration will asymptotically increase as element abundance decreases , until it reaches some maximum value corresponding to the sufficiently low abundance when all the element lines disappear and radiative acceleration will no longer be sensitive to the abundance ( for more detail see * ? ? ?",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "surprisingly , the accelerations are very little dependent on abundance in the photospheres above @xmath130 g@xmath3 and do not exceed gravity for any abundance except at the extreme base of our models . here a ne deficit ranging from -0.5 dex for the hottest to -2 dex for the coolest model could be supported by radiation ( i.e. radiative acceleration roughly equals gravity for this abundance and depth , @xmath131g@xmath3 ) .",
    "this weak abundance sensitivity results from the fact that resonance  lines are not very strong because they are in the lyman continuum where the continuous opacity is very large , effectively reducing line to opacity ratio . we have found that contributions to the radiative acceleration of lines originating from excited  levels is also important , but these weak lines do not introduce strong dependence on the abundance because their line - to - continuum opacity ratio is low due to the high excitation energies and low populations of the levels from which they originate .",
    "one can see from the figure that there is no abundance for which the radiative acceleration could balance the gravity in the line forming region above @xmath130g@xmath3 .",
    "the implication is that in this region , assuming a stable atmosphere devoid of any motions , ne should sink and should be almost completely depleted and only its strong concentration gradient could balance the downward flux of ne atoms .",
    "the ne atom is at least an order of magnitude heavier than the mean ` molecular ' mass of the gas , so the characteristic scale of the ne abundance gradient would be an order of magnitude less than the pressure scale height , i.e. @xmath132 . consequently , the fact that ne is detected in most hgmn stars @xcite suggests the presence of some kind of instability competing with diffusion and suppressing the efficiency of diffusion processes .",
    "an example of such an instability is the weak stellar wind suggested by @xcite .",
    "one may also notice a sudden drop in the radiative accelerations at approximately @xmath133 g@xmath3 .",
    "this is not a numerical artifact but a very interesting effect when radiative acceleration may acquire negative values ; this will be discussed in more detail below .      to take the redistribution effect into account properly",
    "one would need to calculate probabilities of all possible radiative and collisional transitions from the upper level to continuum including multiple cascade transitions as suggested by @xcite .",
    "that is a very difficult task and the above authors developed a method in which they set @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 for lower states .",
    "thus their @xmath49 is a simple step function of level energy and does not depend on e.g. temperature . to cope with the problem and estimate the influence of the redistribution effect we propose a slightly different and more general approach .",
    "the idea is simple . as mentioned in section",
    "[ theory ] , collisions with electrons may change the ionization state before the momentum absorbed by the atom is lost in collisions with protons . consequently",
    ", the redistribution function from a particular excited level depends mainly on the electron to proton collisional rates ratio . higher atomic levels with energies corresponding to the electron kinetic energy @xmath137 below the ionization threshold",
    "are most strongly coupled to the continuum via collisional excitation and ionization .",
    "probabilities of such processes are strongly temperature dependent via the boltzmann factor @xmath138 @xcite and still deeper atomic levels are affected as one goes deeper into the star .",
    "electron to proton number density ratio almost does not change with depth in such hot stars and the boltzmann factor thus embraces the essence of the electron to proton collision rates ratio and one may write @xmath139 . consequently , based on eq .",
    "[ e9b ] we suggest the following expression for the @xmath49 : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the @xmath8-th ion ionization potential and @xmath142 are adjustable constants .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to calibrate precise values for the above mentioned constants .",
    "@xmath143 is most important as it parameterises the temperature dependence and is of the order of 1 .",
    "the @xmath144 term was introduced for those who prefer to use a @xcite type of redistribution but do not like its step function shape and @xmath67 is of the order of @xmath145 , but we use @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 parameterises the ratio of the total electron to proton collision rates .",
    "if @xmath148 the level will register all electron impacts and @xmath149 . because electrons are @xmath150 faster than protons , their collisions will be more frequent by approximately the same factor , and c is thus of the order of 40 .",
    "the method of @xcite is equivalent to the approximation of eq.[e21c ] by a temperature independent rectangle and could be approached as a special case when @xmath151 and @xmath152 or @xmath146 depending on whether @xmath153 or @xmath154 , respectively , where @xmath155 is some threshold energy .",
    "note that @xmath152 means @xmath156 i.e. no redistribution at all and @xmath146 means @xmath157 a small value , i.e. total redistribution is approached but never fully realised .",
    "assuming that @xcite took the lowest @xmath158 level of cii as a cutoff in their calculation for @xmath159k which corresponds to @xmath160 cm@xmath4 below continuum , we can simulate their method ( using our eq .",
    "[ e8 ] ,  [ e9 ] and forcing @xmath136 or @xmath134 ) and calibrate our method so that it would give @xmath162 at the same temperature .",
    "assuming @xmath163 we get from eq .",
    "[ e21c ] that @xmath164  a reasonable value indeed .",
    "results of both methods are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f6b ] and one can see that while both methods may give similar results for @xmath159k the @xcite method strongly overestimates the redistribution effect for lower temperatures .",
    "a simple test of the redistribution effect treatment is recommended by calculating radiative accelerations without weighting them by diffusion coefficients ( setting @xmath165 for example in eq .",
    "[ e10 ] ) .",
    "this is because such accelerations are an invariant of the redistribution process .",
    "we calculated an atmosphere model for @xmath166k , @xmath167 , corresponding to one of the envelope models of @xcite .",
    "then we calculated the radiative accelerations , but in the case of we omitted all except the resonance lines , to simulate the assumption adopted by @xcite .",
    "this assumption is not really justified as the omitted lines contribute significantly to the radiative acceleration .",
    "inclusion of  lines originating from excited levels , which absorb at the wavelengths where a star radiates much more than in the lyman continuum , may increase the acceleration on  by more than 1.5 dex .",
    "however , this does not have any serious consequences on the conclusions of @xcite , as the radiative accelerations are so small they will still remain below the gravity .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . in this case",
    "we also considered @xmath165 in eq .",
    "[ e10 ] to follow their method .",
    "the agreement is quite good and small departures at the base of the atmosphere are mainly caused by slightly different temperature behaviour between our model atmosphere and their envelope model .",
    "the curious gap in our curve at @xmath168g@xmath3 appears because the acceleration is negative here and can not be plotted on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the aforementioned negative acceleration is a very interesting nlte effect which may lower still further the radiative accelerations on some ions in this part of the atmosphere .",
    "it is a consequence of the temperature inversion in the model atmosphere and the atomic structure of . as shown in fig .",

    "thus , according to the diffusion approximation , the star radiates into itself towards cooler regions at these wavelengths .",
    "if an element happens to have its important transitions in the lyman continuum it may be pushed into the star by the radiation and its acceleration is thus negative .",
    "similar effects can be expected also in the cores of very strong lines not necessarily in the lyman continuum . to explore nlte effects on the results we also calculated radiative accelerations on  for three different assumptions in a representative nlte model atmosphere with @xmath169 and zero microturbulence :    1 .",

    "the approximate nlte case is parallel to the lte acceleration but about 1.5 dex smaller .",
    "this is caused by the difference in computed energy fluxes .",
    "while flux in the approximate nlte case is real - lines are in absorption - and surprisingly close to the flux in the full nlte case , the resonance  lines are in emission in lte as soon as the atmosphere becomes optically thin in the lyman continuum and acceleration soars immediately .",

    "could a ne deficit of about 0.5 - 2.0 dex be supported by the radiation , depending on the effective temperature .",
    "this implies that , in the stable atmospheres of late b stars , ne should be almost completely depleted from the photosphere .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with the observations of @xcite but the fact that we detected ne in some hgmn stars suggests the presence of some weak transport or mixing mechanism contaminating observed layers by ne from the reservoir underneath .",
    "possibly , this mechanism is associated with the partial hydrogen ionization at the cool end and a very weak stellar wind at the hot end of the hgmn  span .",
