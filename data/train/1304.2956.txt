    "<S> conclusion this simple mechanical model is able to evolve into a stable synchronized state for certain choices of parameters in the driving force when the initial condition is within some region of the synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> we do not need hydrodynamic interactions to achieve stable synchronization ; we include hydrodynamic friction on each bead , with force free and torque free conditions and a phase dependent driving force , which can be constructed with a suitable combination of harmonic terms . for many choices of force profile , </S>",
    "<S> some initial conditions allow the model to evolve into the synchronized state , while other initial conditions that are very close to the synchronized state lead to an oscillating state . </S>",
    "<S> there are some force profiles , including constant forcing , where there are no initial conditions that evolve into the synchronized state , and if the system starts in the synchronized state when the driving forces are equal , even a small amount of numerical noise can drive the system into an oscillating state . </S>",
    "<S> there are different types of periodic behaviour for different choices of parameters in the driving force ; often the phase difference oscillates about @xmath89 , but sometimes the oscillations can occur close to zero with multiple peaks per cycle .    when the parameter in the driving force is different for the left and right beads , we can get periodic oscillating states about a range of values , or we can get a drifting oscillating state , where one bead has a higher average angular velocity than the other . when the coefficients have equal magnitude and opposite sign , this can lead to oscillations about the synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> this frustrated synchronization is interesting when we add intrinsic noise to the driving force , because then the behaviour of @xmath37 is very similar for both opposite coefficients and equal coefficients , although the behaviour in the orientation is different in the two cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear mechanics of the system make it difficult to study analytically and it is not easy to predict the parameter ranges which give stable synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results have highlighted some of the main types of behaviour of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> an important feature is that it is necessary to have some sort of phase dependent driving force in order to have a stable type ( i ) or type ( ii ) synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> when the phase dependence is only weak , then the synchronized state is unstable , which we see from figure [ fig : harmstab ] when the coefficient is small . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the coefficient at which the phase dependence becomes strong enough to give synchronization depends on the harmonic , whether we choose a positive or negative coefficient , and whether we choose sine or cosine . </S>",
    "<S> these latter choices are equivalent to adding a constant phase @xmath180 , @xmath89 or @xmath181 in the harmonic term .    </S>",
    "<S> this simple mechanical model shows a wide range of behaviour when we vary the parameter in the driving forces . </S>",
    "<S> the variety of stabilities suggests possibilities for developing run - and - tumble models , where noise can be used to to jump between regions of a phase diagram that lead to synchronization or oscillations , or jump between phase diagrams as we did in reference @xcite .    </S>",
