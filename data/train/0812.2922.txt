    "many basic effects related to icm - ism interactions ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping ) are still not well understood .",
    "these effects include the fate of star - forming molecular clouds , the rates of triggered star formation versus gas removal , and the possible reconfiguration of a galaxy s large - scale magnetic field and/or cosmic - ray ( cr ) particles .",
    "it is also not known how far from cluster centers the stripping occurs ; for example , gas - deficient galaxies are found in cluster outskirts @xcite yet it remains unclear if they are stripped in cluster cores or locally in the outskirts as seems to be the case in ngc  4522 @xcite .",
    "if we can find clear tracers of ongoing ram pressure and identify galaxies in different stages of the stripping process , then we can further understand the consequences of stripping . since ram pressure will more easily affect lower density constituents of the ism",
    ", it seems that the diffuse radio continuum halos of galaxies may be sensitive tracers of active icm pressure as indicated by observations for a number of virgo cluster spirals including ngc  4522 @xcite , ngc  4402 @xcite , ngc  4254 @xcite , and a few others @xcite .",
    "more specifically , large regions of enhanced polarized radio continuum emission have been found within a number of cluster spirals @xcite ; the maxima of the polarized radio continuum within these galaxies are located along outer edges and thought to arise from external influences of the cluster environment .",
    "however , without a good idea of the galaxy s unperturbed appearance in the radio , these observations alone make it difficult to quantify the ram pressure effects .",
    "we now address this by predicting the radio distribution expected in the absence of ram pressure by using the nearly universal correlation between the far - infrared ( fir ) and non - thermal radio continuum emission of normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the fir - radio correlation within field galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found that the dispersion in the fir / radio ratios across a galaxy disk is as small as the dispersion of the global correlation ( i.e. @xmath00.3  dex ) on scales down to @xmath1100  pc . while a number of other authors have studied how global fir / radio ratios behave among cluster galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , finding them to be systematically lower than those for field galaxies , it is only now by using",
    "_ spitzer _ that we can study the influence of the cluster environment on the fir / radio behavior _ within _ galaxies allowing us to better explain the global fir / radio observations .",
    "the fir - radio correlation is driven by the process of massive star formation .",
    "massive stars both heat dust , yielding fir emission , and end their lives as supernovae ( sne ) whose remnants ( snrs ) , via shocks , accelerate cr electrons in a galaxy s magnetic field bringing about synchrotron radiation . using a phenomenological smearing model , in which a galaxy s fir map is smoothed by a parameterized kernel to compensate for",
    "the fact that the mean free path of dust heating photons is much shorter than the diffusion length of cr electrons , @xcite has shown for a sample of 15 non - virgo spiral galaxies that the dispersion in the fir / radio ratios on sub - kiloparsec scales _ within _ galaxies can be reduced by a factor of @xmath12 , on average .",
    "accordingly , it is possible to derive a good first order approximation of an undisturbed galaxy s non - thermal radio continuum morphology from its fir image .    assuming that dust and gas are well mixed within galaxies , the fir emission distribution provides a reasonable picture for the molecular gas distribution as modulated by heating by starlight .",
    "the non - thermal radio continuum emission , on the other hand , is a function of a galaxy s magnetic field and cr electron distributions ( i.e. the relativistic phase of the ism ) .",
    "systematic departures from the nominal fir / radio ratios across galaxy disks undergoing icm - ism interactions can provide insight into differential influence of these interactions on the gaseous and relativistic phases of the ism .",
    "these differences may help to quantify the icm pressure acting on the ism of such galaxies .    with the capabilities of current observatories",
    "the virgo cluster remains an ideal laboratory allowing for many resolution elements across a large number of galaxy disks , especially at fir wavelengths . coupling fir observations taken by the _",

    "this is done using fir _",
    "spitzer _ maps to predict how the radio morphology should appear if the galaxy were not experiencing an interaction ; in this paper we make the case that significant deviations from such an appearance are directly related to icm - ism interactions .",

    "we also find best - fit scale - lengths of 0.2  kpc for ngc  4388 and 0.0  kpc for ngc  4579 , which likely result from their bright seyfert - type nuclei .",
    "our aim is to determine if differences between the observed and modeled radio continuum images arise from icm - ism interactions and , if so , whether quantifying and comparing such differences within our sample can help improve our current physical picture of such interactions .",
    "we therefore create ratio maps between the observed and modeled radio maps in the following manner .",
    "we divide the observed radio map by the modeled radio map , keeping only those pixels ( @xmath65 ) detected at @xmath665-@xmath51 rms level of either map .",
    "we also construct a map giving the associated uncertainty at each pixel of the ratio map ( @xmath67 ) by numerically propagating the uncertainties of the input images as measured by the 1-@xmath51 rms of their maps .",

    "the ratio maps are displayed in column 3 of figure [ fig - maps ] .",
    "next , we identify regions for which the ratio of observed to modeled radio flux density departs significantly from unity . to do this we compute the interquartile standard deviation of the ratio map which is the standard deviation computed after removing values included in the first and fourth quartiles ; we denote this value as @xmath68 which , for a gaussian distribution , is equal to @xmath1@xmath69 the population standard deviation .",
    "radio deficit regions are constructed using pixels which simultaneously obey the following two conditions : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the first condition selects pixels which are significantly deviant with respect to the rms noise of the maps while the second condition selects pixels which are significantly deviant with respect to the intrinsic dispersion of the ratio map within the galaxy disk .",
    "similarly , radio excess regions are constructed from all those pixels in the ratio map which simultaneously obey the conditions such that : @xmath70 and @xmath72 .",
    "radio excesses appear largely coincident with regions associated with synchrotron tails like those observed in ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 . in the cases of ngc  4524 ,",
    "ngc  4321 , and ngc  4579 , the radio excess regions appear to be possibly associated with the streaking in the 70  @xmath14 data . on the other hand , for most of our sample galaxies",
    "we detect radio deficit regions which are located along a single edge of their disks .",
    "the radio deficit regions are generally found opposite radio excess regions that are associated with synchrotron tails ; this is illustrated in figure [ fig - tails ] for ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 , and ngc  4522 .",
    "ngc  4254 is an exception , for which an excess region is also found interior to the deficit region .",
    "since these synchrotron tails are likely identifying the direction of the icm wind , we focus our attention toward the radio deficit regions as they are probing directly the most intense effects of the ongoing icm - ism interactions . we define the maximum ratio , or fractional deficit , used for identifying radio deficient pixels as @xmath73 and find @xmath74 among the sample galaxies .",
    "we note that the lack of high - quality radio continuum data for the entire sample is a limiting factor for this study .",
    "the large range in the rms noise of the radio maps ( see table [ tbl - obsdat ] ) prohibits a proper comparison between the deficit regions for each galaxy .",
    "however , since there is such small scatter in @xmath75 , we choose to use a constant value of @xmath76 , or 50% of the expected flux , for creating the deficit region maps of all galaxies ; this allows for the most reliable inter - galaxy comparison . doing the same for excess regions we find @xmath77 and choose a constant value of @xmath78 , or 1.3 times the expected flux , for creating the excess region maps of all galaxies",
    "the radio continuum deficit ( black ) and excess ( cyan ) regions are given in column 4 of figure [ fig - maps ] and are overlaid by the contours of the viva h  i images .",
    "to compare quantitatively the radio deficiencies among the sample galaxies we define two parameters .",
    "first , we measure the ratio of the deficit region area ( @xmath79 ) to that of the total galaxy area given by the size of our ratio maps ( @xmath80 ) which are determined by the regions of either significant fir or radio emission .",
    "next , we calculate the severity of the deficit as measured by the parameter @xmath81 which measures the difference between the observed and modeled radio flux densities within the radio deficit region normalized by the global radio flux density of the galaxy ( i.e. the flux densities given in table [ tbl - flux ] ) . these values along with the flux densities and areas of the deficit regions are given in table [ tbl - rcdefres ] .",
    "the ratio maps in column 3 of figure [ fig - maps ] exhibit gradients near one edge of the galaxy disks for most of the sample ; the lowest ratios lie preferentially along these edges .",
    "a comparison of these gradients with our beam demonstrates that they are in fact resolved .",
    "furthermore , these gradients are opposite to what is expected if we were not smoothing the infrared images enough to estimate properly the cr - electron diffusion lengths since , as observed , the radio disks of galaxies are generally found to be characterized by a larger scale - length than their infrared disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "unlike the rest of the sample , we do not identify statistically significant radio deficiencies within the disks of ngc  4321 and ngc  4580 .",
    "we do detect radio deficit regions in ngc  4396 and ngc  4579 , however these regions may arise from non - icm related effects .",
    "the radio deficit region for ngc  4396 is detected to the north next to a number of nearby background galaxies .",
    "it is unclear if the observed radio deficit region partly due to a confusion artifact resulting from the background galaxies , or if it is real . unlike the infrared map ,",
    "the radio continuum and h  i images appear to have a sharp edge coincident with the radio deficit region ; however , this region is not opposite the location of extended h  i emission . in the case of ngc  4579",
    "we find a radio deficit region interior to the edge of the h  i disk .",
    "the region is consistent with a streaking artifact in the 70  @xmath14 image resulting from the galaxy s bright , seyfert - type nucleus .    for the remaining six galaxies ( i.e. 60% of the sample ) , regions identified to be radio deficient are always at an edge of the disk and opposite of any identified h  i tails .",
    "for example , h  i tails are clearly identified by the contour overlay on the radio continuum deficit region maps of ngc  4330 and ngc  4522 in column 4 of figure [ fig - maps ] . h  i tails are also observed for , and opposite to the radio deficit regions of ngc  4254 , ngc  4388 , ngc  4402 , and ngc  4569 , however they are not easily visible in figure [ fig - maps ] either because the viva data is not sensitive enough to pick up the low level emission ( i.e. ngc  45254 and ngc  4388 ) or because of smoothing the data for resolution matching ( i.e. ngc  4402 and ngc  4569 )",
    ". the radio continuum deficit regions also appear opposite any observed radio continuum tails which is clearly illustrated for ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 , and ngc  4522 in figure [ fig - tails ] .",
    "the combination of these observations suggests that the radio deficit regions likely arise from the same gravitational or gasdynamical effects which have displaced the galaxy s h  i gas and relativistic plasma .",
    "since we think that the h  i tails are created by the icm wind , we therefore believe that the radio deficit regions identify the zone in which the icm wind is actively working on each galaxy s ism .    for those sample galaxies with radio deficit regions , the fractional area of the disk defined to be radio deficient ranges from @xmath15 to 30% .",
    "we also find that the difference between the observed and modeled flux densities within the deficit region , normalized by the global flux density ( i.e the parameter @xmath82 ) , range from @xmath11 to 15% .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that deficit area ratio increases with increasing @xmath82 ( see table [ tbl - rcdefres ] ) .      to determine whether the identification of the radio continuum deficit regions is unique to these cluster galaxies we repeat the above analysis on six non - virgo galaxies observed as part of sings : ngc  2403 , ngc  3031 , ngc  3627 , ngc  4631 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  6946 .",
    "a detailed comparison of the fir and radio properties of these galaxies , along with the rest of the wsrt - sings sample , can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite do not report finding asymmetric gradients in the fir / radio ratio maps for their sample of mostly field galaxies , suggesting that the fir and radio properties of these virgo galaxies do differ systematically from those in the field . to test this further , we repeat the exercise of looking for radio deficit regions among these six galaxies .",
    "the smoothing scale - lengths used to create the modeled radio maps are given in table [ tbl - scl ] .",
    "however , before constructing model radio and ratio maps , the infrared and radio images of these galaxies were smoothed appropriately to simulate their appearance at the distance of virgo .",
    "this ensures distance effects , such as differences in the physical resolution of each disk , will not introduce any biasses into the comparison .",
    "the final beam sizes , along with the corresponding noise in the radio and infrared maps , are given in table [ tbl - obsdat ] .",
    "the ratio maps of each galaxy are given in figure [ fig - singsmaps ] using the same color scale as for the ratio maps of the virgo galaxies in the third column of figure [ fig - maps ] .",
    "unlike some of the ratio maps for the virgo sample ( e.g. ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 ) we do not find strong gradients near the edges of the disks for the non - virgo galaxies .",
    "we also note that it was not necessary to show maps of radio continuum deficit regions for the wsrt - sings galaxies since , except for two cases , radio deficits were not detected .",
    "the first exception is ngc  3031 where we find a few pixels ( i.e. @xmath00.8% of the total area ) to be radio deficient just surrounding its nucleus ; this likely arises from its bright agn .",
    "the other exception is ngc  3627 , in which the north - west region of the galaxy is significantly radio deficient ( i.e. @xmath83 and @xmath84 as noted in table [ tbl - rcdefres ] ) ; among the virgo galaxies with radio deficit regions detected , only ngc  4524 has a lower @xmath82 value .",
    "the radio deficit region is located opposite of its observed h  i tail @xcite and just north of an area observed to have highly polarized radio emission @xcite .",
    "the consistency in the location of the deficit region with other tracers for ongoing icm - ism interactions , combined with the fact that ngc  3627 is a member of the leo triplet , suggests that the radio deficit region may arise from an interaction within the group .",
    "the control sample behavior clearly demonstrates that the radio deficiency morphology observed in virgo galaxies is singular and most naturally explained as a result of icm - ism interactions .",
    "the virgo spiral ngc  4522 is one of the clearest cases where the effects of ram pressure , resulting from the galaxy s rapid motion through the icm , are directly observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a combination of observational data including asymmetric and extraplanar emission in the h@xmath11 @xcite and h  i @xcite lines are highly suggestive of such icm - ism interactions .",
    "while the icm wind has stripped away atomic gas , apparent by the extraplanar h  i gas , the extraplanar h@xmath11 emission is thought to arise from extraplanar h  ii regions ; so it appears that virtually the entire ism has been stripped away from the outer disk , including molecular clouds .",
    "the stripping appears to have occurred very recently .",
    "both the stellar population study of the stellar disk beyond the gas truncation radius @xcite and a comparison of the observed gas distribution and kinematics with simulations @xcite indicate that the galaxy was stripped within the last @xmath85  myr .",
    "thus , it is likely that the current ram pressure is still significant .",
    "the h  i contour overlay on the radio deficit region of ngc  4522 in figure [ fig - maps ] shows that the deficit region runs along the eastern edge of the galaxy , opposite the extraplanar h  i gas .",
    "furthermore , the radio continuum emission itself appears asymmetric ; the radio disk has a sharp cutoff along the eastern edge and extraplanar emission past the western edge similar to that of the h  i gas .",
    "this is consistent with the picture in which the icm is acting on the eastern ( leading ) edge of the galaxy disk , where we find the radio continuum to be deficient , and is pushing the ism ( gaseous and relativistic phases ) toward and beyond the western edge .",
    "radio polarization and spectral index data of ngc  4522 provide evidence for an ongoing icm - ism interaction @xcite ; the eastern edge of ngc  4522 is found to be highly polarized and has the flattest spectral index , which steepens as one moves towards the western side of the galaxy . in the first column of figure [ fig - n4522 ]",
    "we plot the radio continuum deficit regions and overlay the 20 to 6  cm spectral index and 6  cm polarized radio continuum maps of @xcite .",
    "we find that the regions of high polarization and flattest spectral index ( i.e. @xmath86 ) lie just interior to the radio deficit region . while the peak in the polarized radio continuum is coincident with the flattest part of the spectral index distribution , this is not where the total radio intensity ( or fir ) peaks as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "this is also evident in figure [ fig - n4522b ] where we show the 6  cm radio continuum emission together with the vectors of the magnetic field uncorrected for faraday rotation @xcite , on the radio deficit map .",
    "the magnetic field vectors appear to be elongated parallel to the radio deficit region and the icm - ism interaction surface .",
    "these observations suggest that , except for synchrotron tails or the radio deficit regions , to first order , star formation in the disk still drives the appearance of the fir / radio ratios . however , by inspecting the observed - to - modeled",
    "radio continuum ratio map of ngc  4522 displayed in the second column of figure [ fig - n4522 ] , which was created using our _ smoothed _ 70  @xmath14 image ,",
    "icm - ism effects become more apparent .",
    "we find a localized peak in the ratios just outside the radio deficit region , and near the regions of high radio polarization and flat spectral indices ; we attribute this peak to a local enhancement in the radio brightness .",
    "we now try to determine the most plausible physical scenario to explain this combination of observations .",
    "ram pressure from the icm can in principle work to both compress the ism , possibly triggering star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as truncate a galaxy s star - forming disk by sweeping away interstellar material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , ram pressure may act on a galaxy s relativistic ism by compressing or stretching its magnetic field , redistributing cr particles , as well as by re - accelerating cr particles via icm triggered shocks .",
    "while the high level of radio polarization in ngc  4522 could arise from a compressed magnetic field , such an occurrence is not clearly supported by our observations .",
    "since the synchrotron emissivity goes roughly as the square of the magnetic field strength , we would expect a distinct region of enhanced radio continuum emission , where the field is being compressed and amplified , to lie just interior to the radio deficit region .",
    "if there is such an enhancement in the total radio continuum just behind the radio deficit region we are probably not resolving it , but its amplitude must be modest since a strong signature in the ratio map is not detected .",
    "on the other hand , we also observe a large region of relatively flat spectral indices ( i.e. @xmath86 ) interior to the deficit region .",
    "while @xcite report an average radio spectral index of @xmath87 for a sample of 74 star - forming galaxies , the radio spectral indices of snrs , whose associated shocks are thought to be the primary acceleration sites for crs , are found to be slightly flatter , typically ranging between @xmath1@xmath88 both in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and m  33 @xcite .",
    "these values are also consistent with those predicted by diffusive shock acceleration theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it seems plausible that the flat indices interior to the deficit region of ngc  4522 is the signature of cr electron acceleration sites within ngc  4522 .",
    "we would therefore expect such areas to exhibit moderate enhancements in total continuum emission .",
    "these observations are consistent with the interpretation that the icm wind is sweeping up cr electrons in a low pressure outer - region of the disk as well as driving a series of shocks into the ism which will re - accelerate cr electrons there .",
    "the latter secondary shocks , or shocklets , will likely originate at the interface between the icm and ism , arising from inhomogeneities and turbulence .",
    "this would then explain the large region of flat spectral radio indices and area of modest increase to the radio continuum , as observed",
    ". some of the cr electrons , including those that are newly accelerated , will be swept behind the galaxy creating a synchrotron tail that limit the enhancement to the radio surface brightness even though acceleration is occurring .    a second explanation for the existence of the high radio polarization could be that of shear as discussed by @xcite which does not require total magnetic field amplification . in this scenario",
    "the icm wind sweeps up crs and the magnetic field ; the ism magnetic field lines are stretched thereby increasing the fraction of polarized radio continuum emission without significantly increasing the total field strength .",
    "this process alone , however , does not explain the observed flat spectral indices .",
    "we therefore prefer the scenario in which the magnetic field of ngc  4522 is being sheared along the interacting region between its relativistic disk and the icm as ram pressure induced shocks propagate into its ism .",
    "the locally depressed radio continuum emission in the deficit region is the result of ram pressure from the icm sweeping up low density cr electrons , associated with past star formation activity which have diffused significantly far away ( @xmath1kpc ) from their acceleration sites in supernovae .",
    "while we do not find significant enhancements to the total radio continuum behind the deficit regions , the magnetic field may still be moderately compressed .",
    "some of the cr electrons which have been swept - up by the icm are redistributed downstream producing the synchrotron emission tails as observed very prominently here , as well as for ngc  4402 @xcite ; this effect will limit the enhancement to the radio surface brightness .",
    "another subset of particles , however , are re - accelerated interior to the radio continuum deficit region raising the total radio power as evidenced by the flat spectral indices and modest increase in the radio continuum found in the ratio map of ngc  4522 .",
    "the preference for this scenario is discussed further in the context of the observations from the entire sample in @xmath36.2 .",
    "we have shown that a large fraction of our sample of cluster galaxies exhibits statistically significant radio deficit regions relative to the prediction of the phenomenological image - smearing model of @xcite .",
    "such deficit regions are not found within normal field galaxies , suggesting that cluster environment processes are at work . comparing our results with other observational data for ngc  4522 , a galaxy which is clearly experiencing the effects of ram pressure",
    ", we find our deficit region agrees with such a scenario and adds new insight into the interaction .",
    "similar to the example of ngc  4522 , radio polarization observations of other virgo cluster galaxies exhibit highly polarized radio emission along the side of the galaxy presumed to be the leading edge of the icm - ism interaction .",
    "for the galaxies in our sample having polarization data and which show evidence for being disturbed ( i.e. ngc  4254 , ngc  4388 and ngc  4402 ) , the regions of highly polarized continuum emission appear coincident with the modest local radio continuum enhancements found in our ratio maps ( i.e. ratios of @xmath1@xmath89 ) and interior to our radio deficit regions . when averaged over these kpc - sized regions , such enhancements in the total radio continuum translate , roughly , into a compression and amplification of the magnetic field by @xmath1@xmath90% , clearly a modest effect .",
    "thus , the scenario described for ngc  4522 seems to be applicable for these galaxies as well based on the polarized radio continuum results . with this picture",
    "we will use the findings from our analysis to quantitatively assess the strength of the ram pressure from the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "since the radio deficit regions detected for ngc  4396 and ngc  4579 differ empirically from what we find for the rest of the sample , and show evidence for being artificial , we exclude them from the following discussion ( see @xmath3[sec - ratmaps ] ) .",

    "our ram pressure estimates from minimum energy arguments give a good rough approximation for the strength of ram pressure within a factor of a few , but can not be expected to measure precisely the differences in ram pressure among the sample galaxies .",
    "further work is required to more closely and quantitatively relate the radio deficit to the strength of ram pressure .    in figure [ fig - tirup ]",
    "we find that there is a general trend of decreasing values of @xmath82 with increasing tir surface brightnesses as measured by the ratio of each galaxy s global tir flux to @xmath80 , the deprojected area of their ratio map .",
    "since tir surface brightness and @xmath122 are directly related , this trend is not terribly surprising .",
    "interpreting the tir surface brightness to be a proxy for the mean ism density , we find that galaxies having a more dense ism appear to be less affected by the icm .",
    "this seems reasonable given that the ram pressure would need to be stronger to disturb their ism and is consistent with higher values for the internal relativistic plasma pressure for small values of @xmath82 .",
    "however , this trend may be fortuitous given that the external ram pressure likely varies tremendously among the sample .",
    "using our results on the spatially resolved fir / radio distributions of these cluster spirals , along with their global fir / radio properties , we will now investigate whether the icm wind plays a significant role in enhancing the escape and re - acceleration of cr electrons .",
    "after considering escape , we explore a number of physical scenarios to explain simultaneously the local and global fir / radio ratio behavior among these galaxies before coming to our preferred picture .",
    "the only galaxy with a high global @xmath45 value is ngc  4580 .",
    "while the cr electrons are being moved around by the icm wind , it is unclear as to whether they easily escape the galaxy disks as global @xmath45 ( logarithmic fir / radio ) ratios do not appear systematically high with respect to the nominal value of @xmath1@xmath124  dex ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in fact , by plotting @xmath45 against @xmath82 ( our parameter defining the severity of the deficit region ) in figure [ fig - qup ] we find a trend of decreasing fir / radio ratios with increasing @xmath82 and that nearly all of the @xmath45 values are lower than the nominal value .",
    "other , more detailed studies on the global fir and radio properties of cluster galaxies have pointed out notably lower fir / radio ratios than expected from the fir - radio relation in the field @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there is either depressed fir emission or an enhancement in the global radio emission among our sample galaxies . and while the trend in figure [ fig - qup ] may simply be the result of small number statistics",
    ", it also might suggest that @xmath45 is sensitive to the strength of the icm ram pressure and perhaps a galaxy s stripping history .",
    "we do not detect a radio deficit region for ngc  4580 .",
    "this galaxy is highly h  i deficient , having the largest deficiency value in table [ tbl - galdat ] ( 1.53  dex ; a factor of @xmath15 larger than the median value among the sample ) , and has been classified as an anemic spiral @xcite , though better described as having a severely truncated star - forming disk @xcite .",
    "it appears to have been stripped long ago ( @xmath1475  myr ) and is the only post - strongly stripped galaxy in our sample observed so long after peak pressure @xcite .",
    "we therefore speculate that its high @xmath45 value is the result of cr electron escape as the icm wind has swept out most of the galaxy s gaseous and relativistic ism long ago leaving only the central disk .",
    "the only other galaxy for which we do not detect a radio deficit region is ngc  4321 which is much different from ngc  4580 .",
    "ngc  4321 has not been strongly stripped and has a near - average @xmath45 value ; this galaxy appears much more similar to the wsrt - sings field galaxies .      as already discussed in @xmath3[sec - cr_b ] , we have attributed local enhancements to the radio continuum arising from the re - acceleration of cr electrons by icm induced shocklets .",
    "while moderate local enhancements are found in the radio continuum interior to the radio deficit regions via the ratio maps , they do not appear significant enough to explain @xmath45 ratios which are @xmath00.4  dex lower than average ( i.e. a factor of @xmath02.5 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 values of taffy systems are found to be a factor of @xmath12 low due to excess radio continuum emission associated with the synchrotron bridges connecting the galaxy pairs @xcite . looking to see",
    "if synchrotron tails may be causing a similar effect in ngc  4522 ( where the observed synchrotron tail appears most striking ) we find that this can not be the case .",
    "only @xmath125% of the total radio continuum emission is associated with the tail .    while we have argued that it does not seem likely that the magnetic field has been compressed significantly ( i.e. no more than @xmath030% as suggested by the radio excesses ) at the leading edge between the ism and the icm wind , leaving no clear signatures of a gradient in the ratio map , perhaps the field strength is raised globally due to thermal compression by the surrounding icm as suggested by @xcite .",
    "models of such an effect seem to be able to produce the factor of @xmath126 excess synchrotron emission and reproduce the observed @xmath45 ratios @xcite .",
    "if such a scenario were true , and the virgo galaxies with low @xmath45 ratios are simply compressed versions of field galaxies , we would expect galaxies with the lowest @xmath45 ratios to appear compressed in all directions and exhibit relatively larger internal relativistic plasma pressures , @xmath122 , compared to virgo galaxies with larger @xmath45 ratios .",
    "however , the galaxies having the lowest @xmath45 ratios both exhibit extraplanar radio continuum emission along their trailing edges in the form of diffuse synchrotron tails and do not have larger @xmath122 values relative to the rest of sample , inconsistent if compression was the dominant mechanism .",
    "another possibility is that the fir emission is depressed in these systems through the removal of a dust component .",
    "for instance , the icm wind may have removed a substantial amount of the cool dust ( cirrus ) component , a significant contributor to the total fir emission . however , fir color differences between the stripped virgo galaxies and the wsrt - sings spirals are too small to induce differences in the seds and total fir emission large enough to account for the differences in @xmath45 . the mips @xmath127 and @xmath128 flux density ratios have medians that are @xmath129  20% lower and higher , respectively , than those found for the wsrt - sings spirals .",
    "both samples have fir colors in the range of quiescent normal star - forming galaxies , where the 20% color differences translate into small changes in the sed , and changes of only a few percent in fir normalized either to the 24 or 70  @xmath14 emission , based on the @xcite sed templates .",
    "the 24  @xmath14 emission component is relevant for normalization because of its close association with hii regions and dense , star - forming regions @xcite , making it much more resistant to stripping than the longer wavelength components .",
    "this result is consistent with the study of @xcite who also found that the fir properties ( i.e. luminosities and colors ) of cluster galaxies having excess radio emission are similar to those of field galaxies .",
    "the fir emission in these systems may also be depressed , without systematic changes in their fir colors , as a result of depressed star formation activity per unit area .",
    "if ram pressure from the icm wind is driving shocklets into the ism , mechanical energy would be dissipated into molecular clouds as turbulence , possibly reducing their efficiency to collapse and form new stars . however , in order for a galaxy to exhibit @xmath45 values similar to those reported here , the decrease in star formation activity must have begun within the last @xmath150  myr ( i.e. roughly the expected cr electron cooling time to synchrotron losses ) . at later epochs ,",
    "the synchrotron emission associated with the previous star formation episodes fades away , and @xmath45 values drift back towards more normal values even if the star formation activity remains depressed . since 50",
    "myr is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the cluster crossing time , it is unlikely that we would be observing so many galaxies during this special period of time .",
    "it therefore appears that depressed fir emission is not the dominant effect driving the systematically low @xmath45 values for these galaxies .",
    "while it is still not completely unambigous , we believe the most plausible explanation is that the icm wind raises the global cr electron energy and synchrotron power by driving shocklets into the ism which are re - accelerating cr electrons . taking again @xmath130  km  s@xmath17 and the range in @xmath92 values discussed in @xmath3 [ sec - pram ] , and assuming the average surface area of each galaxy disk exposed to the icm wind is 25  kpc@xmath131 ( i.e. the mean size of the radio deficit regions given in table [ tbl - rcdefres ] ) , we compute the kinetic energy per unit time a galaxy will inherit from the icm wind . comparing this number to that of the mean radio continuum luminosity among those galaxies listed in table [ tbl - rcdefres ] , and assuming a number density ratio of protons - to - electrons , for particles in the energy range corresponding to ghz synchrotron emission , of 100 , we find that @xmath1@xmath132% of the total kinetic energy available must be given to the crs in order to double the radio luminosity .",
    "while a value @xmath111% may be slightly large , there are many uncertainties involved with this calculation including whether the cr electrons are more efficient than cr nuclei at absorbing this energy . in any case , it is certainly clear that the available mechanical luminosity of the system is enough to cause the observed global excess in synchrotron emission . the fact that we only find relatively moderate local enhancements to the total continuum behind the radio deficit region , save perhaps ngc  4254 where a less modest radio excess is observed ( i.e. ratios peaking at @xmath11.7 ) , suggests that the shocks run through the entire galaxy disk rather quickly .",
    "the shock speed through the galaxy , @xmath133 , which must be super - alfvnic to re - accelerate cr electrons , should have a value around @xmath134 where @xmath106 is the ram pressure , as defined in equation [ eq - pram ] , and @xmath135 and @xmath92 are the ism and icm densities , respectively . again taking @xmath130  km  s@xmath17 , the range in @xmath92 values discussed in @xmath3 [ sec - pram ] , and @xmath136  @xmath119 leads to shock velocities ranging between @xmath115 to 25  km / s . assuming a thin disk thickness of 500  pc",
    ", the shocks should run through each disk within @xmath120 to 40  myr ; indeed this is very short compared to the dynamical timescale of these systems .",
    "as previously noted , this proposed mechanism may work to slow down star formation itself , decreasing the infrared surface brightness , either from an increase in cold molecular cloud heating by the re - accelerated cr particles or similar gas - phase shocklets perturbing the clouds .",
    "however , it is unclear how significant this effect may be relative to the increase in synchrotron emissivity via the associated re - acceleration of cr electrons .",
    "since many cluster galaxies have highly radial orbits , the direction to the cluster center can help provide some insight as to whether a galaxy may be traveling into or away from the cluster center .",
    "the direction toward the cluster center is indicated on the radio deficit maps in figure [ fig - maps ] .",
    "some galaxies have deficit regions facing toward the cluster center ( ngc  4254 , and ngc  4402 ) which is suggestive of a galaxy entering the cluster and at a phase of pre - peak pressure . on the other hand",
    ", we also find an example for which the radio deficit region faces away from the cluster center ( ngc  4569 ) which may suggest that the galaxy is on their way out of the cluster and past peak - pressure .",
    "there are also galaxies which face neither directly towards or away from the cluster center ( ngc  4330 and ngc  4522 ) leading to a more complex scenario ; such objects may be stripped by interactions with sub - cluster structures ( e.g. ngc  4522 with m  49 ) .",
    "we also note that ngc  4388 may be interacting with the m  86 sub - cluster ; its h  i tail points neither towards or away from the cluster center but rather towards m  86 @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is that of ngc  4254 which is thought to be entering virgo for the first time at high speed .",
    "it has recently been suggested by @xcite and @xcite that a large h  i tail associated with ngc  4254 is a tidal arm resulting from galaxy harassment @xcite .",
    "however , no interacting counterpart has been identified . also , the h  i tail is located opposite the observed radio deficit region and the direction to the cluster center .",
    "since it appears that the radio deficit regions are related to the effects of ram pressure , it therefore seems plausible that the large h  i tail could be the result of ram pressure stripping .",
    "however , it is also possible that the radio deficit region may be created via galaxy harassment or that , more plausibly , both physical processes are currently at work .",
    "projection effects , specifically the orientation of the galaxy disk with respect to the icm wind direction and our line - of - sight , likely play a significant role in determining the location of deficit region centroids . for largely face - on systems ,",
    "the relationship between the deficit region location and the direction of the wind is probably more easily predicted than for more highly inclined galaxies .",
    "the highly inclined galaxies ngc  4330 , ngc  4402 , and ngc  4522 , have radio deficit regions consistent with lunes along one side of their disks ; these could occur over a large range of wind angles .",
    "furthermore , the size of the observed deficit region is subject to projection effects as well , likely appearing much smaller for disks viewed face - on , especially if they are moving through the icm along the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore it is hard in general to gauge whether galaxies may be pre- or past - peak pressure from the direction of the cluster center with respect to the deficit region . in figure",
    "[ fig - dup ] we plot @xmath82 against the distance to the cluster center .",
    "the lack of observed trend suggests that the 3d structure of the cluster along with presence of sub - cluster structures are important in understanding icm - ism interactions and the picture of a smoothly distributed and static icm is overly simplistic for characterizing icm - ism interactions .      while we can explain regions having radio continuum emission without corresponding fir emission as the result of cr electrons being swept into a synchrotron tail by the icm , the observation of fir emission without corresponding radio emission is a bit more interesting since it suggests a strong departure from typical ism conditions .",
    "even though such regions are close to the noise limits of the infrared and radio maps , this result appears to be significant . in figure [ fig - pixid ]",
    "we show two examples ( i.e. ngc  4402 and ngc  4522 ) for which we detect 70  @xmath14 emission more radially extended than the radio ; these regions are found _ only _ along the galaxy edge associated with the radio deficit region .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath45 were constant across these galaxy disks , we would expect to detect the radio continuum in these regions at @xmath103-@xmath51 rms level of the radio maps .",
    "however , we know that @xmath45 does not remain constant across galaxy disks and actually decreases with increasing galactocentric radius @xcite , implying even higher levels of radio continuum should be expected , easily exceeding @xmath106-@xmath51 rms noise levels .",
    "we therefore conclude that the non - detection of radio emission is significant at least at the @xmath16-@xmath51 level or , in other words , @xmath015% of the expected radio continuum emission is present .",
    "these observations then suggest that the diffuse relativistic and gaseous ism have been stripped away along these leading edges leaving the denser molecular material as traced by the 70  @xmath14 dust emission .",
    "presumably , the low density relativistic phase is quickly removed due to an increase in open magnetic field lines leading to the quick escape of cr particles . while our observations do not rule out that synchrotron emission associated with the remaining molecular clouds is still present and simply below our detection limit , since the diffuse component will dominate the total radio continuum emission in these regions , it is still interesting to speculate how quickly this synchrotron emission associated with the remaining molecular clouds would fade as cr electrons diffuse away . assuming a flux freezing scaling of @xmath137 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a solar neighborhood ism density and magnetic field strength of @xmath138  @xmath119 and @xmath139 g @xcite , and an average giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) density of @xmath140  @xmath119 leads to a gmc magnetic field strength of @xmath141 g .",
    "this value is actually quite consistent with field strengths of molecular clouds inferred from the chandrasekhar - fermi technique @xcite using polarized dust continuum emission ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . rewriting equation 24 from @xcite for diffusion alone , such that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the time it takes a cr electron emitting at frequency @xmath144 to diffuse a distance @xmath145 in a magnetic field of strength @xmath6 assuming random walk diffusion characterized by an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , we can calculate the time it would take the cr electrons to diffuse away from the molecular clouds . taking @xmath146 g and @xmath147",
    "kpc leads to a diffusion time of @xmath11.7@xmath148  yr for cr electrons to leave the molecular clouds ; this is considerably short compared to the stripping timescales and plausible given our observations .",
    "such a scenario may have implications for star formation in these regions as well . according to equation [ eq - prism ] and assuming minimum energy arguments ,",
    "the complete lack of cr pressure , which works to support a cloud from collapse , will decrease the total relativistic ism pressure by @xmath130% .",
    "this situation may encourage cloud collapse in these regions leading to enhanced star formation .",
    "on the other hand , the icm wind will also perturb molecular clouds introducing additional turbulence further discouraging collapse . determining which of these competing effects will actually dominate",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have studied the interstellar medium ( ism ) of 10 virgo galaxies included in the vla imaging of virgo in atomic gas ( viva ) survey using _ spitzer _ mips and vla 20  cm imagery . by comparing the observed radio continuum images with modeled distributions ( i.e. appropriately smoothed fir images ) , created using a phenomenological image - smearing model described by @xcite , we find that the edges of many cluster galaxy disks are significantly radio deficient .",
    "these radio deficit regions are consistent with being leading - edge regions affected by intracluster medium ( icm ) induced ram pressure as suggested by the location of h  i and radio continuum tails . from our results we are able to conclude the following :    1 .   the distributions of radio / fir ratios within cluster galaxies thought to be experiencing icm - ism effects are systematically different from the distributions in field galaxies .",
    "radio / fir ratios are found to be systematically low , due to a deficit of radio emission , along the side of the galaxy experiencing the icm wind .",
    "2 .   in the case of ngc  4522 , a clear example of ongoing strong stripping , we find that the radio deficit region lies exterior to a region of high radio polarization and a flat radio spectral index .",
    "we interpret this to suggest that cr electrons in the halos of galaxies are being swept up by the icm wind .",
    "the icm wind drives shocklets into the ism of the galaxy which re - accelerate cr particles interior to the working surface at the icm - ism interface .",
    "some cr electrons may also be redistributed downstream creating synchrotron tails as observed for ngc  4522 .",
    "the high radio polarization is probably mostly the result of shear as the icm wind stretches the magnetic field ; compression may also play a role , though a modest one , since the total radio continuum in these regions does not appear significantly enhanced .",
    "the severity of the current icm - ism interaction , as measured by the normalized difference between the modeled and observed radio flux densities in the radio deficit regions , appears to be strongly correlated with the time since peak pressure as measured by stellar population studies and gas stripping simulations .",
    "thus the radio deficit appears to be a good tracer for the strength of current ram pressure .",
    "4 .   using the identified radio deficit regions we are able to get a quantitative estimate of the minimum strength of the icm pressure required to affect a galaxy disk ; we find values in the range of @xmath1@xmath149  dyn  @xmath117 .",
    "these pressures are generally smaller than , but similar to , those estimated for typical values of the icm gas density and galaxy velocities , as well as the range of ram pressures calculated by 3d hydrodynamical simulations . therefore , our estimates are consistent with the scenario of ram pressure creating the observed deficit regions .",
    "the internal relativistic plasma pressures range between @xmath12 and @xmath150  dyn  @xmath117 and appear to be lowest in some of the galaxies with the strongest radio deficits .",
    "thus the strength of the radio deficit may also be affected by the internal relativistic plasma pressures of the galaxies as well as external ram pressure .",
    "further work will be required to learn how much the radio deficits depend on these 2 variables .",
    ".   the global radio / fir ratios of these cluster galaxies are systematically higher than the average value found for field galaxies and appear to increase with increasing severity of the local radio deficit , which may trace current ram pressure .",
    "we attribute this to an increase in the cr energy density which is greater when the interaction between the icm - ism is more energetic .",
    "we also show that the amount of mechanical luminosity available from a galaxy s motion through the icm is significantly larger than what is required to heat the cr plasma .",
    "this paper describes a preliminary study comparing the fir and radio emission distributions of virgo cluster galaxies using the first 10 out of @xmath140 galaxies for which _ spitzer _ data was available .",
    "we have clearly shown that by comparing the fir and radio continuum distributions of these cluster galaxies we can address a number of physically important characteristics affecting their evolution including the strength and directions of the icm wind .",
    "the inclusion of the remaining @xmath130 sample galaxies along with other ancillary data sets will help to better distinguish among scenarios presented here and better illuminate our understanding of how the icm affects the relativistic phase of the ism .",
