    "the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ detected a significant population of galaxies that emit large fractions of their bolometric energy in the mid- and far - infrared ( ir ) bands .",
    "the majority of luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7  @xmath8 ) are powered by massive stars that have recently formed in their central kiloparsec @xcite .",
    "the far - ir luminosities of these galaxies therefore measure the amount of star formation activity @xcite .",
    "local starburst galaxies with far - ir luminosities of @xmath9 @xmath8and normal spiral galaxies with @xmath5 @xmath10 @xmath8also show evidence for active star formation in their central ( @xmath11  kpc ) regions , even though their far - ir luminosities are much lower than those of lirgs @xcite .",
    "the formation of o and b stars affects the physical and chemical state of the interstellar medium through stellar uv radiation and through the effects of stellar winds and supernovae @xcite .",
    "strong near - ir h@xmath0  emission lines have been observed from the central regions of galaxies , especially from starburst galaxies and lirgs .",
    "since h@xmath0  vibration - rotation emission can trace the interaction of the neutral ism with the uv radiation from hot young stars and its interaction with sources of dynamical energy such as supernovae , the h@xmath0  luminosity may also be a good tracer of star formation activity .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to explore how well we can use this additional , readily observable tracer of the interaction of massive stars with the dense interstellar medium to study massive star formation in the inner parts of galactic disks .",
    "the observational part of this paper emphasizes new , large - beam observations of emission in the vibration - rotation transitions of h@xmath0  in the near - ir from nearby late - type galaxies and low luminosity starbursts . for normal galaxies , observations of near - ir h@xmath0  lines",
    "have been restricted to local bright regions because the average surface brightness of the h@xmath0  emission is low . in a previous study",
    ", we used an instrument optimized for observations of low surface brightness line emission in the near - ir to detect enormously extended ( @xmath12 or @xmath13  pc ) h@xmath0  emission along the plane of the galaxy near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the integrated and dereddened h@xmath0  @xmath1  luminosity from the extended region ( @xmath14 @xmath8 ) dominates over that from the previously known 5  pc circumnuclear gas ring ( @xmath15 @xmath8 , @xcite ) .",
    "our results for the inner 400 pc of the milky way motivated us to begin a study of h@xmath0  emission from the central kiloparsec of other nearby galaxies where it may be possible to detect extended , low surface brightness h@xmath0  emission using the same large - aperture fabry - perot spectrometer used in the galactic work .",
    "the large - beam observations we present here make it possible to compare for the first time the h@xmath0  emission to the far - ir continuum and far - ir fine - structure line emission at similar angular resolution and over similar angular scales .",
    "the observations also give us measurements of h@xmath0  line strengths from nearby objects with linear scales comparable to those obtained with slit spectrometers for the more distant luminous ir galaxies . with this broad range of spatially compatible observations ,",
    "we investigate whether it is possible to formulate a generalized star formation law which can be applied to galaxies over a wide range of levels in star formation activity .    in order to analyze the h@xmath0  line data and to compare them with other star formation tracers , we need to identify the excitation mechanism responsible for the h@xmath0  emission . in the central regions of galaxies , however , the excitation mechanism for the h@xmath0  emission has long been the subject of intense controversy ( see the reviews of @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed nearby spiral galaxies using a circular variable filter ( @xmath16 ) and a beam full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 196 .",
    "they detected , , and  lines and concluded that the h@xmath0  line populations are non - thermal .",
    "however , @xcite presented high spectral resolution data ( @xmath17 ) and pointed out that the  flux measurement of @xcite could be affected by unresolved stellar absorption lines .",
    "they argued that the h@xmath0  emission is mostly from shocks .",
    "@xcite suggested that high spectral resolution observations are essential to discriminate between the excitation mechanisms .",
    "the ultimate energy source responsible for the excitation of the h@xmath0  vibration - rotation emission can lie either in the absorption of uv photons from the ambient interstellar radiation field or from local ob stars , or in shock waves excited by supernovae , protostellar flows , or other energetic events @xcite .",
    "hydrogen molecules that absorb far - uv radiation make a transition to an excited electronic state . at low densities ,",
    "this transition is followed by fluorescence to the ground electronic state and a cascade through that state s vibration - rotation levels @xcite .",
    "this interaction between h@xmath0  molecules and uv radiation takes place at the edges of molecular clouds where hydrogen makes the transition from predominantly atomic to predominantly molecular gas , in the photodissociation region ( pdr : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20  @xmath21 , the relative intensities of vibration - rotation transitions in the near - ir arising in uv - excited h@xmath0  are insensitive to density or to uv field strength @xcite and depend only on the branching ratios in the downward cascade . in dense (",
    "@xmath18 @xmath6 @xmath22  @xmath21 ) gas heated by intense far - uv radiation , @xcite showed that inelastic h@xmath23h@xmath0  and h@xmath0@xmath23h@xmath0collisions can heat the gas at the cloud edge to temperatures approaching 1000  k. a combination of the collisional de - excitation and collisional excitation in the high temperature layer alters the h@xmath0  level populations in this uv - excited gas .",
    "the expected changes in relative line strength with density have been verified by observations of molecular cloud edges @xcite . in shocked regions , the h@xmath0  vibration - rotation energy level populations in the ground electronic state",
    "are thermalized by collisions and the level populations are usually in lte @xcite .",
    "because the level populations are thermalized and reflect a similar range of temperatures , shock - heated gas and hot , dense gas heated by uv radiation are difficult to distinguish .",
    "most previous observations of the central regions of galaxies showed that the h@xmath0  line ratios of  to  lie between the ratios one would expect for fluorescently excited h@xmath0  and what one would see in observations of uv - heated but collisionally excited gas or of gas collisionally heated in shocks @xcite .",
    "these intermediate ratios suggest that both pure uv - fluorescence and thermalized uv - excited ( or shock excited ) gas are responsible for the h@xmath0  emission @xcite .",
    "detection of h@xmath0  lines arising from upper vibrational states with @xmath24 is a strong indication of the presence of uv - fluorescent excitation since the high energies of the upper states make it very hard to excite these transitions thermally .",
    "there are marginal detections of such transitions from a few galaxies , e.g. , a giant  region ngc 5451 in m101 @xcite , arp 299 @xcite , and some ultraluminous ir galaxies @xcite .",
    "another method for discriminating between the h@xmath0  excitation mechanisms is to measure the h@xmath0  nuclear spin degeneracy ratio ( ortho- to para - ratio ) , which may deviate from its formation value if the gas is thermally processed , but remains constant in the case of non - thermal excitation .",
    "observations of  and  showed that the h@xmath0  emission in the galactic centers arises mostly from uv - fluorescence @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have observed vibration - rotation transition lines of h@xmath0  from the nuclei of seven ulirgs and concluded that the line emission arises from dense pdrs irradiated by intense far - uv radiation fields . in galactic sources , we have used observations of h@xmath0  lines from high vibrational states @xcite , as well as comparisons of extended h@xmath0  emission and tracers of uv excited pdrs such as far - ir continuum and ] emission to show that much of the h@xmath0  emission arises from uv - excited gas @xcite .",
    "this comparison with far - ir lines and continuum has been more difficult in other galaxies because of the significant differences between the ] and far - ir  beam sizes and the typical slit sizes used for near - ir spectroscopy of h@xmath0 . in this work",
    ", we will use both h@xmath0  line ratios and a study of various tracers of star forming clouds in the context of pdr models to learn more about the relative significance of various types of h@xmath0  excitation .    in section  [ sec :",
    "observations ] , we present a description of our spectroscopic observations of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 , and the normal spiral galaxies ngc 6946 and ic 342 . in section  [ sec : results ]",
    "we first show the observed h@xmath0  spectra and their extinction - corrected line fluxes .",
    "we then show the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0  line intensity and compare it to the distribution of other pdr tracers , e.g. , co line emission and sub - mm continuum . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we analyze the nature of the h@xmath0  excitation mechanism by comparing the measured h@xmath0  line ratios with thermal and non - thermal models .",
    "we also calculate the luminosity ratios of h@xmath0  to far - ir and ]  to far - ir , and discuss the implications of the observed ratios by comparison to predictions by pdr models .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we have observed emission lines resulting from vibration - rotation transitions of h@xmath0  from the central @xmath25 kpc regions of m82 , ngc 253 , ngc 6946 , and ic 342 .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] lists the basic parameters of the four galaxies in our sample .",
    "we made the observations at the 1.5 m telescope of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) and the 5 m hale telescope of the palomar observatory with the university of texas near - ir fabry - perot spectrometer ( utfps ) .",
    "the spectrometer was designed to observe extended and low surface brightness line emission by maximizing the area - solid angle product @xcite . in order to subtract the telluric oh line emission , we chopped the secondary mirror from the source position to @xmath26 ( at ctio ) or @xmath27 ( at palomar ) at 0.5 hz . the fabry - perot etalon was scanned to cover the emission profiles , and each spectral step consisted of one chopping cycle : object  sky  sky  object ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "the detailed procedure for the utfps observations is described in @xcite .",
    "the instrument , as used for the observations described in this paper , differed in one respect from the instrument described in @xcite . for the 1996 september run",
    ", the fabry - perot etalon was housed in an enclosure cooled thermoelectrically to @xmath28c to reduce the background signal and to stabilize the instrument against drifts in the plate spacing .",
    "the beam shape on all runs was approximately cylindrical @xcite .",
    "we indicate the beam size at each telescope using the equivalent disk size , @xmath29 , the diameter of a cylindrical beam whose solid angle is the same as the integrated solid angle of the actual beam pattern .",
    "since the one - dimensional beam pattern was close to that of a box function , the fwhm of the beam pattern is almost the same as @xmath29 . after the 1995 december run at the palomar observatory",
    ", we changed the optical configuration inside the instrument .",
    "the equivalent disk size on the 1996 september run ( @xmath30 ) was smaller than that on the 1995 december run ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the telescope pointing uncertainty was , in all cases , less than 10 percent of the beam size .",
    "as the area - solid angle product of the instrument changes , the resolving power of the spectrometer also changes by a small amount , i.e. , r=@xmath32 varies between 2300 and 3000 .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] therefore also lists the effective spectral resolution for each wavelength and observing run .",
    "the flux calibration was done by measuring standard stars at the center of the beam profile .",
    "the flux calibration uncertainty is less than 20 percent .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] summarizes the observation logs , and lists the instrument parameters and the flux calibration stars .    on the 1995 december run and the 1996 september run",
    ", we used the hale telescope , where the utfps beam has a linear size of @xmath33  pc in our target galaxies , to map the central regions of these galaxies ( except ngc 6946 , where only a single point was observed ) .",
    "we observed h@xmath0  line emission along the major axis or the molecular bar known previously from co observations ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) stepping either 10  or 15between the individual measurements . at some positions",
    ", we also observed  line emission . on the 1995 october ctio run",
    ", we observed the , , and  lines in ngc  253 with a beam size of 81  ( @xmath341 kpc in this galaxy ) .",
    "this large beam covers the entire region scanned during the 11  beam observations in ngc  253 .",
    "we observed h@xmath0  emission lines from m82 with the ir cryogenic spectrometer ( crsp ; @xcite ) at the 2.1  m telescope of the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) in 1996 december .",
    "the crsp is a long - slit spectrometer with a slit length of 824 ( 135  pixels @xmath35 061 ) .",
    "we used a 300 l / mm grating and a slit width of 2.7 pixels ( or 165 ) and the resulting spectral resolution was @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38  km  s@xmath39  at @xmath40 , corresponding to r@xmath411060 .",
    "the grating was tilted to take spectra in the @xmath42  band which includes the h@xmath0  2.12183 ,  2.22329 , and 2.24771  emission lines .",
    "the crsp slit used toward m82 was rotated to match the major axis ( p.a .",
    "= 73 ) of the co molecular bar @xcite . in order to cover the extended emission from the central region",
    ", we also took spectra with the slit displaced by @xmath43 perpendicular to its length : ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) @xmath37 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , ( 0 , 0 ) , and ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "we co - added 9 pixels along the spatial direction ( or slit length direction ) and co - added the data taken at all three slit positions to make high signal - to - noise spectra reflecting the near - ir emission from a rectangular beam of @xmath50 . in the central region of m82 ,",
    "the h@xmath0emission may extend up to 10  in the minor axis direction ( see section  [ sec : distr_m82 ] ) .",
    "even though the co - added rectangular beam did not include all of the flux from m82 , the h@xmath0  line ratios from these data are more reliable than those derived from fabry - perot observations made at different times because the ratios are less dependent on the sky conditions ( see section  [ sec : h2ratio ] ) .",
    "the crsp measurements can therefore contribute to our analysis of the h@xmath0  excitation mechanism .",
    "figures @xmath51 show the h@xmath0spectra taken with the utfps toward m82 , ngc 253 , ngc 6946 , and ic 342 . on each h@xmath0  spectrum , we have overlaid a @xmath52co @xmath53spectrum taken with a similar beam size and smoothed in the spectral direction with a gaussian smoothing function to the resolution of the utfps to allow us to compare the radial velocities and the line shapes more carefully . in general ,",
    "those h@xmath0  line profiles with high signal - to - noise are similar to the co profiles from the same positions .",
    "the similarity argues for a similar distribution of line emissivity with galactocentric radius , implying that the h@xmath0  emission and co emission arise from the same molecular clouds . at the m82 positions ( e27,n13 ) and",
    "( w27 , s13 ) , however , the co and h@xmath0  profiles differ .",
    "at least part of the change in shape and velocity profile may result from the beam pattern difference between the co and h@xmath0  observations .",
    "the spatial 16  beam of the nobeyama radio telescope is gaussian while that of the utfps 16  beam is cylindrical .",
    "this shape difference could work in concert with the large gradient in rotational velocity at these positions to produce the profile differences .",
    "figure  [ fig-08 ] shows selected spectra taken by crsp toward m82 .",
    "the h@xmath0  lines are prominent and detected at all positions .",
    "the  and  lines are clearly detected at the ( e105 , n32 ) , ( w105 , n32 ) , and ( w210 , s64 ) positions , but are confused with stellar absorption features at the ( 0 , 0 ) position where the continuum level is highest .",
    "the relative strength of  and  in this work agrees with that of @xcite ( see section  [ sec : h2ratio ] ) .",
    "there is a possible detection of the  line at ( w210 , s64 ) , but this line was not detected at other positions .    in figure [ fig-02 ]",
    ", we overlaid the h@xmath0  and lines from m82 , as observed with the utfps .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission at ( 0 , 0 ) is very similar to the line profile of the transition while the match in line shapes is less clear at ( e14e , n6 ) where the signal to noise ratio of the  observation is small .",
    "fluxes and upper limits for the h@xmath0  and  lines toward ngc 253 and ngc 6946 are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "table  [ tbl-4 ] lists line ratios , principally for the  to  ratio , along the major axis of m82 .",
    "s / n for the ratio determination ranges from 2 to 6 . however , temporal variations in telluric absorption may increase the uncertainty for the line ratios derived from the utfps data .",
    "we determine the h@xmath0  line flux by integrating across the velocity interval containing the line .",
    "we define the line emission bandwidth , @xmath54 , based on the @xmath52co @xmath53  or @xmath55line spectra and list the values in table  [ tbl-3 ] . for each profile , we integrate over this velocity interval , subtracting a continuum value determined from the average of the channels at the two ends of the spectrum .",
    "we label the flux in the portion of the spectrum where we are integrating over the line as ( @xmath56 ) and that over the spectral region containing only continuum as ( @xmath57 ) where the subscript @xmath58 is an index for the individual samples along the spectrum . the integrated line flux ( @xmath59 ) is calculated as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average of @xmath57 and @xmath62 is the interval between the channels in the scanning mode ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "the error ( or noise ) of the integrated line flux is derived from the standard deviation , @xmath63 , of @xmath57 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the numbers of individual spectral samples in the emission and continuum bands , respectively .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] lists the observed positions and the measured fluxes of the h@xmath0  , , and  emission lines .",
    "note that the flux values , at the same wavelength and the same position , vary with the beam size because the emission regions are extended .",
    "the fwhm ( @xmath67  km  s@xmath39 ) of the instrumental profile of crsp is wider than the typical fwhm of m82 emission lines . assuming the line profile is gaussian",
    ", we derive the h@xmath0line flux by using the single profile fitting task in the _ iraf _ package , splot .",
    "the error in the flux is derived using equation  ( [ eq : fluxsigma ] ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath37 @xmath70 .      the molecular hydrogen flux that we observe likely arises from the surfaces of giant molecular clouds exposed to far - uv radiation @xcite .",
    "therefore , as for the large - scale co line emission from galaxies , the area filling factor for the observed h@xmath0  line emission is likely to be less than unity , so that much of the emergent h@xmath0  will suffer only modest extinction and the foreground screen model for extinction is appropriate .",
    "if the h@xmath0  emission is widespread and arises from the surfaces of clouds , then there would only be a loss of half the h@xmath0  flux ( from the back side of each cloud ) , and a further loss from the foreground extinction .",
    "the screen model is highly effective in modeling the extended h@xmath0  line emission in the central kiloparsec of the milky way . here",
    "the h@xmath0  emission would not be detectable at all if the emitting sources were uniformly mixed with molecular gas clouds , since co observations indicate these clouds typically have @xmath71  @xmath72 @xcite .    the far - uv radiation that gives rise to the observed h@xmath0  line emission arises from a slightly older population of stars than those that excite  regions .",
    "these older stars are not likely to be still embedded in their natal clouds and can therefore produce the observed widespread h@xmath0  emission .",
    "in contrast , the  recombination lines likely emerge from  regions excited by very early type stars that are still embedded in their natal molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , one might expect the extinction of the  recombination lines to be significantly higher , and the mixed extinction scenario may be more likely to apply to these lines .",
    "however , the application of a screen model even to the observed br@xmath73  flux from both ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) @xcite and normal and nearby starburst galaxies @xcite results in a reasonably tight br@xmath73  to far - ir correlation that suggests no large extinction corrections are required .",
    "the foreground screen model is applicable for all of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the most controversial galaxy in our sample is the nearby , highly inclined ( @xmath74 ) galaxy , m82 @xcite .",
    "extensive modeling of the observed h recombination line emission from m82 suggests @xmath71  @xmath37 3 to 9 magnitudes when a uniform foreground screen model is applied @xcite .",
    "however , a model where the dust and  regions are homogeneously distributed also fits the data and suggests that @xmath71  @xmath37 25 to 52 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we argue that while a mixed model _ may _",
    "apply for the  recombination lines , it is not appropriate for the h@xmath0  lines due to the argument outlined above . to compare the extinction corrected results , in table  [ tbl-5 ] , we applied both foreground model and mixed model to the h@xmath0  data of m82 .    in converting from visual extinction , @xmath71 , in table",

    "<S> , the near - infrared h@xmath0  emission luminosity can directly trace the amount of star formation activity because the h@xmath0  emission lines arise from the interaction between hot and young stars and nearby neutral clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the observed h@xmath0  line ratios show that both thermal and non - thermal excittion are responsible for the emission lines , but that the great majority of the near - infrared h@xmath0  line emission in these galaxies arises from energy states excited by ultraviolet fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> the derived physical conditions , e.g. , far - ultraviolet radiation field and gas density , from ]  and ]  lines and far - infrared continuum observations when used as inputs to photodissociation models , also explain the luminosity of the observed h@xmath0  line . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the h@xmath0  line to far - ir continuum luminosity is remarkably constant over a broad range of galaxy luminosities ; @xmath3 @xmath4 , in normal late - type galaxies ( including the galactic center ) , in nearby starburst galaxies , and in luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7  @xmath8 ) . examining this constant ratio in the context of photodissociation region models </S>",
