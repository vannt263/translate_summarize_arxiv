    "the cosmic star formation rate density ( csfrd ) , @xmath6 , is one of the most fundamental quantities that reveals how present galaxies were formed and evolved in the universe .",
    "it has been probed observationally since the seminal works of lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and madau et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) using various star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators such as luminosities of the stellar continuum at the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) and nebular emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath7 ) .",
    "various observational results are compiled in hopkins ( 2004 ; h04 ) and hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ; hb06 ) , in which the cosmology , stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and dust obscuration correction are unified .",
    "the best - fit csfrd function using these results has been widely utilized not only in observational studies ( e.g. , karim et al .",
    "2011 ) but also in theoretical studies ( e.g. , coward et al .",
    "2008 ; kistler et al . 2009 ; tominaga et al . 2011 ; wang & dai 2011 ) .",
    "the csfrd at @xmath8 has been confirmed by various sfr indicators obtained from wide - field surveys such as the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( e.g. , wyder et al .",
    "2005 ; robotham & driver 2011 ) . its characteristic feature is a rapid increase with redshift ( @xmath9 at @xmath8 ; h04 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the csfrd at @xmath10 is an order of magnitude higher than that in the local universe .",
    "in contrast , the csfrd is still uncertain in the higher redshift range ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) where popular sfr indicators include the rest - frame uv continuum stellar emission and infrared ( ir ) dust emission .",
    "this uncertainty is due to uncertainties in the estimation of the csfrd from observed data : the dust obscuration correction for the uv continuum , contamination from the old stellar population to the ir luminosity , estimation of the total ir luminosity , the faint - end slope of the luminosity function ( lf ) , and the conversion factor from luminosity into sfr .",
    "these uncertainties result in the well - known inconsistencies in some physical quantities between direct measurements and values inferred from the hb06 csfrd function such as stellar mass density ( smd ; @xmath11 : e.g. , wilkins et al .",
    "2008 ; choi & nagamine 2012 ; benson 2012 ) , core - collapse supernova rate ( e.g. , horiuchi et al . 2011",
    "; see also botticella et al .",
    "2012 who report there is no inconsistency in the local 11 mpc volume ) , and extragalactic background light ( e.g. , raue & meyer 2012 ) .    the csfrd has also been calculated theoretically using galaxy formation models : hydrodynamic simulation ( e.g. , nagamine et al . 2006 ) or semi - analytic models ( e.g. , cole et al . 2001 ; nagashima & yoshii 2004 ; benson 2012 ) .",
    "in these models , a galaxy - by - galaxy basis calculation is executed based on a detailed hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "therefore , the csfrd at a certain redshift can be calculated by simply integrating the sfr of each galaxy at that redshift .",
    "although these theoretical models reproduce reasonably well the observed lfs and the luminosity densities ( lds ) at the rest - frame wavelength dominated by stellar emission , and the smd at both local and high @xmath12 , most underpredict the csfrd compared to that estimated observationally ( e.g. , nagashima & yoshii 2004 ; nagashima et al . 2005 ; lacey et al . 2011 ; benson 2012 ) .",
    "while the underprediction of the csfrd might be attributed to some missing unknown physical processes of galaxy formation and evolution , it is worth investigating whether or not the uncertainties in estimating the csfrd from directly observed data could be the origin of the disagreement .    here",
    ", we examine the csfrd through a comparison of the observational data compiled in h04 with the mock catalog of galaxies generated by one of the semi - analytic models for galaxy formation , the so - called mitaka model ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ; see also nagashima et al .",
    "the mitaka model reproduces various kinds of observations not only for local galaxies including the stellar continuum lfs ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) but also for high-@xmath12 lyman - break galaxies and ly@xmath7 emitters ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) . in this paper , we focus on the rest - frame uv continuum luminosity as an sfr indicator ; this is usually applied to galaxies in the high-@xmath12 universe ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "investigation of other sfr indicators , such as the rest - frame ir continuum emitted by interstellar dust , will be the subject of future work .",
    "as shown in the top and middle panels of figure  [ fig - ld+csfr ] , the mitaka model reproduces well the measured smd , @xmath11 , and ld at rest - frame uv wavelengths , @xmath13 , which have not been corrected for interstellar dust attenuation , in the redshift range @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "however , the model prediction for the csfrd is underestimated at @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath163 ( i.e. , @xmath170.5  dex ) relative to the median value of @xmath6 compiled in h04 as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig - ld+csfr ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that these h04 csfrd data are calculated using the same observational uv lds plotted in the middle panel of figure  [ fig - ld+csfr ] , and which are reasonably reproduced by our model .",
    "moreover , our csfrd is consistent with the upper limit for @xmath6 given by strigari et al .",
    "( 2005 ) estimated from an upper limit on the diffuse supernova neutrino background with super - kamiokande . in this paper we show that the underestimation of the mitaka model relative to the h04 csfrd can be fully attributed to two observational uncertainties , the dust obscuration correction and the sfr conversion used in observational studies . therefore the underestimation using theoretical galaxy formation models relative to the h04 csfrd does not necessarily imply that these models should incorporate some missing unknown physical processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : obsunc ] , we list the uncertainties in estimating the csfrd from observed uv lfs . in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe the key prescriptions of the mitaka model relating to the observational uncertainties in estimating the csfrd .",
    "then we compare the model results with the observed lfs , lds , and csfrd in the redshift range @xmath1810 in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize our work in section  [ sec : summary+discussion ] , where we also provide a discussion which includes a new formula for the obscuration correction at rest - frame uv wavelengths in section  [ sec : summary+discussion ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the 737 cosmology , i.e. , @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and a salpeter imf with a mass range of @xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system and the wavelengths are given in the rest frame unless otherwise stated .",
    "in the process of estimating the csfrd at a certain redshift from observational data of galaxies , the basic direct observable quantities are the luminosities which can be used as sfr indicators .",
    "luminosities can be converted into the csfrd via the following processes .",
    "first , the observed luminosities are corrected for dust attenuation in order to obtain intrinsic luminosities which are expected to correlate more directly with the sfr .",
    "next , the lf is constructed from the data corrected for dust obscuration .",
    "since the data are flux - limited samples , the main uncertainty in the shape of the lf lies in the faint - end slope index .",
    "next , the ld is derived by integrating the lf .",
    "these processes can be interchanged if a luminosity - independent obscuration correction is adopted .",
    "finally , the ld is converted to the csfrd using the sfr conversion factor .",
    "thus , uncertainties may arise from ( 1 ) the faint - end slope of the lf , ( 2 ) the conversion factor from luminosity into sfr , and ( 3 ) the dust obscuration correction .",
    "there are other uncertainties in the estimation of the csfrd such as the limiting luminosity to which lf is integrated ( e.g. , reddy & steidel 2009 ) , the imf ( e.g. , hb06 ) , and leakage of ionizing photons ( e.g. , relao et al .",
    "2012 ) . as the limiting luminosity and imf",
    "are calibrated in a common fashion in h04 , we do not need to examine these uncertainties here .",
    "we can also neglect the uncertainty caused by the leakage of ionizing photons because we treat the uv continuum luminosity as an sfr indicator .",
    "hence , here we briefly describe the three uncertainties described in the previous paragraph , focusing on the uv continuum luminosity as an sfr indicator .",
    "in general , the uncertainty in the faint - end slope of the lf , @xmath7 , leads that of the integrated ld .",
    "it is more significant at high @xmath12 simply because only bright galaxies are detected at high @xmath12 in flux - limited surveys and thus the uncertainty in @xmath7 becomes larger .",
    "figure  [ fig - schechter ] shows the lds for various @xmath7 as a function of minimum luminosity .",
    "we normalize the lds by the characteristic luminosity @xmath25 and number density @xmath26 and adopt the schechter function form for the lf . for a typical value of @xmath27 in the uv lfs at @xmath186 ( e.g. , oesch et al .",
    "2010 ) , the uncertainty of @xmath28 results in @xmath290.3  dex ( a factor of @xmath302 ) uncertainty in the ld integrated to @xmath31 .",
    "if this uncertainty fluctuates randomly to positive or negative values , it may be the origin of the dispersion in the lds at each redshift as shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig - ld+csfr ] .    however",
    ", because the uv ld calculated from the mitaka model lies around the median value of the observed uv lds , the uncertainty in @xmath7 is not the origin of the systematic underestimation of the csfrd calculated using the mitaka model compared to that of h04 ; hence , we do not treat this uncertainty further here .",
    "the intrinsic ( i.e. , without dust attenuation ) stellar continuum luminosity at uv wavelengths , @xmath32 , is one of the best sfr indicators .",
    "this is because it is dominated by stellar radiation from recently formed massive stars and rest - frame uv photons from redshift @xmath3310 to optical or near - ir in the observer frame at which we can observe most efficiently with current telescopes .    in observational studies , the conversion factor from @xmath34 to sfr , @xmath35 , given by kennicutt ( 1998 ;",
    "hereafter , k98 ) has been widely utilized : @xmath36 h04 and hb06 also adopted @xmath37 .",
    "however , it should be noted that , as explicitly stated in k98 , the linear relation holds only for galaxies which continuously form stars over timescales of 100  myr or longer , have solar metallicity , and the salpeter imf in the mass range @xmath23@xmath38 ( see also madau et al .",
    "( and hence in @xmath35 ) at @xmath39   is found to be negligibly small ( i.e. , @xmath40  dex ) except during the very young phase of star formation ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) according to the time evolution of @xmath34 for the simple stellar population calculated with the _ pegase _ population synthesis model ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig - tevllam ] shows the time evolution of @xmath35 at @xmath39   for constant and exponentially decaying star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "it is calculated using the schaerer ( 2003 ) population synthesis model , which is used in our model to calculate the uv continuum luminosity of galaxies .",
    "as the true sfr of a galaxy having @xmath34 is represented by @xmath42 , the sfr estimated by @xmath43 wrongly represents the true sfr in the case of @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath37 is larger than @xmath35 , the sfr will be overestimated by a factor of @xmath45 , and vice versa .    in the early phase of constant star formation , @xmath35 is significantly larger than @xmath37 , up to @xmath46  dex at age @xmath47  myr even in the case of solar metallicity @xmath48 as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig - tevllam ] .",
    "this is simply because @xmath34 grows continuously as the number of massive stars with a lifetime of @xmath49  myr increases before it reaches equilibrium , which corresponds to @xmath37 for @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , adopting @xmath37 for such young galaxies results in an underestimation of sfr for a given @xmath34 .",
    "the extent of the underestimation depends on age , metallicity , and wavelength .",
    "conversely , we overestimate the sfr of a galaxy which is old enough to be in equilibrium and which has sub - solar metallicity by up to @xmath51  dex ( a factor of @xmath30 ) .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that lower metallicity stars are bluer ; a smaller sfr is enough to produce a certain @xmath32 compared to stars with larger metallicity .",
    "adopting @xmath37 for such evolved galaxies with sub - solar metallicity results in an overestimation of the sfr , the extent of the overestimation depending on metallicity and wavelength .    in the case of an exponentially decaying sfh",
    ", @xmath35 is not constant even at later stages of star formation if the @xmath52-folding time @xmath53 is short ( i.e. , @xmath54  myr ) .",
    "rather , it decreases progressively with time as shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig - tevllam ] .",
    "this is because @xmath34 does not decrease as fast with time as the sfr .",
    "massive stars with a lifetime of @xmath49  myr can contribute to @xmath32 even after the star formation activity is quenched in @xmath53 .",
    "the k98 sfr conversion method for galaxies where sfr decays quickly , like starbursts , results in either an underestimation or an overestimation of sfr .",
    "@xmath35 should be smaller than @xmath37 for higher-@xmath12 galaxies if their uv luminosities reach equilibrium because such galaxies typically have sub - solar metallicity .",
    "however , if uv lf is dominated by young galaxies whose @xmath32 is increasing , @xmath35 should be larger than @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to treat @xmath35 for a high-@xmath12 universe . in this paper",
    "we investigate the redshift dependence of @xmath35 in detail using the mitaka model .      in order to utilize the uv luminosity of a galaxy as an sfr indicator",
    ", we need to correct for its interstellar dust attenuation .",
    "this leads to the most influential uncertainty in the estimation of the csfrd .",
    "this is because the amount of interstellar dust and its attenuation are not easily measurable from uv data alone ( e.g. , burgarella et al .",
    "moreover , the commonly used dust attenuation curve rises toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "the required luminosity correction can reach @xmath55  dex at uv wavelengths .",
    "h04 adopted two independent dust obscuration correction methods for the various observed lfs : _ common _ and _ sfr - dependent _ obscuration corrections . in both methods , the obscuration correction treats the observed lfs as statistical quantities , that is , h04 implicitly assumed that the observationally bright galaxies are also the intrinsically brightest .    in the common obscuration correction ,",
    "h04 adopted @xmath56  mag for stars ; this is a typical obscuration for uv - selected local galaxies ( see section 2.2 of h04 ) . for the dust attenuation curve",
    ", they adopted the starburst obscuration curve given by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for all galaxies regardless of their luminosities and redshift . under these assumptions ,",
    "the attenuation in magnitude for the stellar continuum at a wavelength of 1500   is evaluated as @xmath57  mag . however , the dust attenuation of high-@xmath12 galaxies is not necessarily the same as that of the local uv - selected galaxies .    in the sfr - dependent correction ,",
    "the obscuration for the uv continuum at @xmath58 , @xmath59 , of a galaxy with observable uv luminosity @xmath60 is obtained by solving the following transcendental equation numerically : @xmath61 where @xmath62 here differs from that of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by a factor of 2.5 : @xmath63 . ] in the case of the calzetti attenuation curve .",
    "figure  [ fig - mvsalam ] shows @xmath59 for both the sfr - dependent correction and the common correction as a function of observable absolute magnitude at @xmath64   .    as shown in figure",
    "[ fig - mvsalam ] , h04 adopted @xmath65  mag at @xmath66  mag because the numerical solution of equation  ( [ eq - rel - sfri+sfro ] ) for @xmath59 becomes negative and this is physically meaningless .",
    "equation  ( [ eq - rel - sfri+sfro ] ) was originally derived from an empirical relation between @xmath67 and the far - ir ( fir ) luminosity @xmath68 for normal galaxies , blue compact galaxies , and starbursts at the local universe , in which brighter galaxies have larger obscuration ( see references given in section 2.2 of h04 ) .",
    "however , the distribution of these galaxies in the @xmath67@xmath68 plane has significant scatter around the empirical relation ( see figure 1 of hopkins et al .",
    "moreover , the numerical constant in the numerator of the right - hand side in equation  ( [ eq - rel - sfri+sfro ] ) contains the uncertainty in @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "even if this obscuration correction method had been derived empirically in the local universe , we should examine its validity in the high-@xmath12 universe .",
    "thus , we investigate here the redshift dependence of the mean of @xmath59 in detail .",
    "hb06 adopted a different approach from to of h04 at @xmath71 ; they added the fir measurements of the csfrd to the obscuration - uncorrected uv data as an effective dust obscuration correction in order to avoid assumptions about the extent or form of the obscuration and variations due to possible luminosity bias in the uv - selected sample ( see section 2.2 of hb06 ) . at @xmath72 , where there is no reliable fir measurement of the csfrd , hb06 adopted the common obscuration correction as in h04 .",
    "as we do not calculate ir emission in this paper , we can not examine the validity of the hb06 method .",
    "however , we give a brief comment on the consistency with the hb06 csfrd in section [ subsec : comments2hb06 ] .",
    "in order to examine the cause of the disagreement between the csfrds obtained in theoretical and observational studies , we utilize a mock catalog of galaxies generated by a semi - analytic model for galaxy formation called the mitaka model ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; updated version of nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) .",
    "the mitaka model follows the framework of the @xmath73cdm model of structure formation and calculates the redshift evolution of the physical quantities of each galaxy at any redshift via semi - analytic computation of the merger histories of dark matter halos and the evolution of baryon components within halos .",
    "the time evolution of baryon components within halos is followed using physically motivated phenomenological models for radiative cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , chemical enrichment of gas and stars , and galaxy mergers . as a result",
    ", various physical and observational properties such as the sfr and intrinsic and observable stellar continuum luminosities of the galaxies at any given redshift can be obtained .",
    "a detailed description of our model is given in nagashima & yoshii ( 2004 ) and kobayashi et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , here we briefly describe some key prescriptions which are closely related to this paper .",
    "then , we explain how to examine the origin of the difference in csfrd between observation and theory by using the mock catalog of galaxies generated by the mitaka model .",
    "the merger histories of dark matter halos are realized using a monte carlo method based on the extended press - schechter formalism ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) . for the halo mass function to provide the weight for summing merger trees , the mitaka model adopts the analytic functional form given by yahagi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; this is a fitting function to their high - resolution @xmath74-body simulation .",
    "dark matter halos with circular velocity @xmath75 are regarded as isolated halos , corresponding to the lower limits of halo mass @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath78 and 0 , respectively .",
    "because of the existence of @xmath79 , fainter galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath80  mag ) are not well resolved in the mitaka model .",
    "however , this limited resolution does not affect the resulting quantities at 1500   , @xmath81 and @xmath6 , because @xmath82  mag is much fainter than @xmath83 and @xmath81 converges well at magnitudes much brighter those shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig - uvlf+uvld - z0 ] .",
    "the intrinsic luminosities and colors of galaxies in our model are calculated according to their sfhs and chemical enrichment histories using a stellar population synthesis model .",
    "we emphasize that we do not assume a simple linear relation between the intrinsic luminosity and sfr even at uv wavelengths . while the original mitaka model uses the population synthesis model of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) , our model uses that of schaerer ( 2003 ) to calculate the uv stellar continuum luminosity as in kobayashi et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "compared to the kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) model , the schaerer ( 2003 ) model is a more recent one and covers a wider range of metallicity ( including zero metallicity ) .",
    "it has already been shown ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) that the revised version of the mitaka model reproduces all well the observed statistical quantities of high-@xmath12 ly@xmath7 emitters and lyman - break galaxies .      in order to calculate observational ( i.e. , with interstellar dust attenuation ) luminosities and colors of model galaxies , we model the optical depth of their internal dust as follows .",
    "we make the usual assumption that dust abundance of a galaxy is proportional to its gas metallicity and that the dust optical depth @xmath84 is proportional to the column density of metals : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the mass and metallicity of cold gas , respectively , and @xmath88 is the effective radius , all of which are obtained in our model .",
    "the normalization of equation  ( [ eq - taud - mitaka ] ) is assumed to be a constant and universal regardless of galaxy properties and redshift , and has been determined to fit the observed data of local galaxies .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the dust optical depth @xmath89 is adopted to be the same as the galactic extinction curve given by pei ( 1992 ) . in terms of the dust distribution ,",
    "our mitaka model assumes slab geometry ( i.e. , a uniform distribution of sources and absorbers ; see equation  ( 19 ) of calzetti et al .",
    "1994 or section 3.2 of clemens & alexander 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , the amount of attenuation magnitude @xmath90 for the stellar continuum is given by @xmath91 note that , while the wavelength dependence of @xmath90 calculated via equation  ( [ eq - alam ] ) is similar to that of @xmath84 ( i.e. , the galactic extinction curve ) at @xmath92 , they are significantly different at @xmath93 : @xmath90 becomes flatter than @xmath84 at @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the wavelength dependence of @xmath90 in our model at @xmath93 is significantly different from that of the calzetti law .",
    "we emphasize that our model calculates star formation and chemical enrichment consistently in the framework of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "therefore , both the time evolution of @xmath84 for each model galaxy and the redshift evolution of its mean at a certain redshift can be naturally incorporated into our model together with the evolution of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .      in this paper , we calculate the csfrd in the redshift range @xmath1810 using the mock catalog of galaxies generated by our model following the prescriptions in h04 .",
    "we treat the mock catalog like observational data compiled from the literature and utilized to obtain the csfrd in h04 .",
    "we emphasize the most striking difference between our catalog and the data compiled in h04 is that each model galaxy in our catalog has information on its intrinsic uv luminosity and sfr as well as the observable luminosity .",
    "we apply the same obscuration corrections as h04 ( i.e. , common and sfr - dependent corrections ) to the observable uv lfs at @xmath1810 given by our model in order to obtain the intrinsic lfs , which are represented as _",
    "common _ and _ sfrdep lfs _ , respectively .",
    "their lds are represented as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "we note here that the observable uv lf given by our model can be separated into contributions from each model galaxy .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic uv lf can be obtained directly by counting the contributions of model galaxies in each magnitude bin .",
    "however , we treat the observable uv lf as a statistical quantity to examine whether the h04 obscuration corrections reproduce the `` true '' intrinsic uv lf and @xmath97 .    the conversion factor @xmath37 is also compared with that of our model both in each galaxy , @xmath98 , and in all galaxies , @xmath99 .",
    "we note again that the intrinsic uv luminosity of a galaxy is calculated according to its detailed sfh and chemical enrichment history ; therefore @xmath35 can vary in every galaxy .",
    "we note here that , while there are several free parameters in phenomenological models for baryon evolution , in our model , they have already been determined to fit the various observations of the local galaxies ( i.e. , _",
    "b_- and _ k_-band lfs , neutral gas mass fraction , and the gas mass - to - luminosity ratio as a function of _ b_-band luminosity ) in nagashima & yoshii ( 2004 ) .",
    "as we utilize the values from this work unchanged in our study , there are no free parameters that can be adjusted .",
    "we first show the results from the h04 approaches to correcting for interstellar dust obscuration .",
    "the intrinsic and observable uv lfs at @xmath100   at @xmath18 are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig - uvlf+uvld - z0 ] .",
    "the common and sfrdep lfs ( top panel ) and their lds ( bottom panel ) are also shown .",
    "both lds agree with the intrinsic one if we integrate the lfs up to @xmath101  mag , even though both lfs show a significant deviation from the intrinsic one .",
    "this might be trivial because both of the h04 corrections are calibrated by galaxies in the local universe .    in order to see the origin of the similarities and discrepancies between the uv lf and ld given by our model and those using the h04 methods , we compare the dust attenuation of model galaxies as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - mag - alam - z0 ] , the means of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , for our model galaxies at each magnitude are found to be almost constant , @xmath1071.0  mag , for @xmath108  mag .",
    "however , model galaxies with a certain magnitude have significant dispersion around @xmath109 up to @xmath110  mag .",
    "this means that a non - negligible number of intrinsically bright galaxies lies at observationally faint magnitudes .",
    "the contribution from such observationally faint and intrinsically bright galaxies to the intrinsic lf and ld is completely neglected if a single value of @xmath109 at a certain magnitude is adopted as the representative attenuation for all galaxies with this magnitude .",
    "therefore , correcting for dust attenuation by using @xmath109 results in underestimation of the bright ends of the intrinsic lf and intrinsic ld .    taking the consideration above into account",
    ", we compare the h04 obscuration corrections with the median quantity @xmath111 for the model galaxies .",
    "the attenuation in the common correction of @xmath112  mag is found to be larger than @xmath109 by @xmath1130.7  mag , that is , within the 1@xmath114 error except for the brightest magnitudes . as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig - uvlf+uvld - z0 ] , this overcorrection for dust attenuation compared to the correction with @xmath111 is not sufficient to compensate for the contribution of the observationally faint and intrinsically bright galaxies at the bright end of the intrinsic lf . however , the overcorrection at faint magnitudes is enough to cover the underestimation of the ld at the bright end .",
    "hence , the common correction results in a similar intrinsic uv ld to that of the mitaka model . on the other hand , attenuation in the sfr - dependent correction of @xmath104 is significantly different from @xmath106 .",
    "we note that it is also different from the recent observational result for star - forming galaxies with @xmath1152.2 , which shows that the mean attenuation at far - uv wavelengths decreases toward the bright far - uv continuum luminosity ( see figure  7 of buat et al .",
    "it is larger and smaller than @xmath109 in the magnitude range @xmath116  mag and @xmath117  mag , respectively .",
    "the overcorrection at bright magnitudes leads to the overestimation of the bright end of the intrinsic lf as shown in figure  [ fig - uvlf+uvld - z0 ] .",

    "however , at faint magnitudes the @xmath120 rapidly converge to the same value ; the asymptotic values of @xmath120 at @xmath18 are found to be unity , as seen in figure  [ fig - uvlf+uvld - z0 ] .",
    "however , it is easily seen that the asymptotic values increase with @xmath12 and reach @xmath17  dex and @xmath121  dex at @xmath33 and @xmath122 , respectively . in summary ,",
    "the h04 obscuration corrections alone result in the overestimation of csfrd by @xmath40.4  dex in the redshift range @xmath1810 compared to that of our model galaxies .      in figure  [ fig - mag - csfr - z0 ] , we show the distribution of model galaxies with @xmath123  mag at @xmath18 in the @xmath35@xmath102 plane .",
    "it is found there are two sequences in the plane : a constant sequence at @xmath124 and a widely spread sequence around the constant sequence with relatively high and low number densities ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) , respectively .",
    "these sequences correspond to the two distinctive galaxy populations in our model , that is , quiescently star - forming and starburst galaxies , respectively .",
    "the quiescent galaxies have long star formation timescales ( @xmath127  gyr ) and form disk stars almost constantly in the timestep of the mitaka model .",
    "therefore , the quantities contributing to @xmath35 already reach equilibrium , with values depending on the stellar metallicity . as there is a well - known magnitude  metallicity relation ( i.e. , fainter galaxies have smaller metallicity ; e.g. , garnett 2002 ) , @xmath35 decreases toward fainter magnitudes .",
    "in contrast , the starburst galaxies , whose starburst activity is triggered by a major merger of galaxies , have short star formation timescales ( @xmath128  gyr ) determined via the dynamical timescale of a newly formed spheroid .",
    "because the starburst onset times are chosen randomly in the timestep of the mitaka model , they have a variety of @xmath35s according to the onset time and @xmath53 as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig - tevllam ] .",
    "the starburst galaxies whose @xmath35 are larger than @xmath37 are relatively young and those with @xmath129 are old enough to have such small @xmath35 .",
    "we also evaluate the mean @xmath35 , @xmath130 , for all our model galaxies at each magnitude .",
    "starburst galaxies dominate the bright end in @xmath102 at @xmath18 ( @xmath131  mag ) while quiescent galaxies determine @xmath130 except for the bright end . as a combination of the contributions from these two distinctive populations , @xmath132",
    "is found to be almost constant in all of the magnitude range shown in figure  [ fig - mag - csfr - z0 ] and is always smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , converting @xmath133 into sfr via @xmath37 results in an overestimation of the sfr for most galaxies at @xmath18 , although the overestimation is not significant ( @xmath134  dex )",

    "@xmath6 and @xmath97 can be rewritten as summations of the contribution from each galaxy via @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where the suffix @xmath140 indicates a galaxy .",

    "this implies that converting @xmath97 for the model galaxies at @xmath18 into @xmath6 using @xmath37 overestimates @xmath6 compared to its true quantity by @xmath147  dex .",
    "the redshift evolution of @xmath143 is also shown in figure  [ fig - csfreff - z ] . it can not be not simply understood because of the following effects . toward high redshift ,",
    "the contribution from young starbursts increases because of the increasing rate of the major merger .",
    "this effect results in an increase in @xmath143 . at the same time , the dynamical timescale of starburst galaxies becomes shorter at higher redshift because the galaxies formed tend to be smaller in size and hence have shorter @xmath53 .",
    "this effect results in a decrease in @xmath143 because @xmath35 rapidly decays in galaxies with short @xmath53 .",
    "these two competing effects lead to an increase in @xmath143 toward @xmath148 and its decrease at @xmath149 .",
    "@xmath143 for @xmath39   is found to be always smaller than @xmath37 by @xmath1500.15  dex .",
    "the reason why @xmath143 is always smaller than @xmath37 is as follows .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - tevllam ] , the time duration during which the galaxies have @xmath35 larger than @xmath37 is short ( @xmath151  myr ) for any metallicity and for both constant and exponentially declining sfhs .",
    "this implies that the chance probability to detect a galaxy with @xmath152 is smaller than the probability to observe a galaxy with @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , high-@xmath12 galaxies tend to have a metallicity smaller than @xmath48 and hence the equilibrium value of @xmath35 is smaller than @xmath37 for the constantly star - forming galaxies . as a consequence of these two reasons ,",
    "the mean of @xmath35 becomes smaller than @xmath37 at all redshifts .    in summary",
    ", adopting the usual conversion factor of @xmath37 for galaxies at @xmath1810 results in an overestimation of @xmath6 by @xmath1540.15  dex .",
    "in this paper , we examined the cause of the inconsistency in the csfrd between theoretical and observational studies , focusing on an sfr indicator for a high-@xmath12 universe , that is , the rest - frame 1500   stellar continuum luminosity @xmath155 . by using a semi - analytic model for galaxy formation , the so - called mitaka model",
    ", we found that the underestimation of the csfrd seen in theoretical model originates from the following two uncertainties in the process to evaluate the csfrd from the observed 1500   ld : the dust obscuration correction and the conversion from @xmath155 to sfr .",
    "the uncertainty in the faint - end slope of the lf is not the origin of the underestimation of csfrd but the origin of the dispersion around the median csfrd .",
    "the methods of obscuration correction adopted in h04 result in the overestimation of the csfrd by @xmath1560.4  dex and the sfr conversion used in observational studies also leads to the overestimation of the csfrd by @xmath1560.2  dex .    since theoretical models including",
    "ours reproduce the observed data for the uv ld which is not corrected by dust attenuation and the data for the smd , the inconsistency in the csfrd does not imply that theoretical models miss some key physical processes in galaxy formation .",
    "of course , the theoretical models are not yet perfect because observed data such as cosmic downsizing ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) remain to be reproduced .",
    "the revision of theoretical models can be achieved through a comparison with direct observed data which are _ not _ affected by a certain model and/or assumptions .    in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief discussion of the origin of the difference in dust attenuation at high @xmath12 between our model and the h04 corrections .",
    "we also present new empirical calibrations for dust attenuation and sfr conversion as well as a recipe for utilizing them in observational studies .      as described in section  [ subsec : result - dust ] ,",
    "the h04 obscuration correction methods reproduce the intrinsic ld from the observable uv lf of our model galaxies at @xmath18 , although they overestimate it at higher redshifts . here",
    "we discuss the origin of the overestimation at high redshift .",

    "@xmath157 becomes smaller at higher @xmath12 because of the redshift evolution of metallicity and dust abundance .",
    "however , such a redshift evolution of dust abundance is not incorporated into the h04 obscuration corrections .",
    "this is the origin of their overestimation of the intrinsic ld .",
    "a quantity similar to @xmath157 has been evaluated from the observed ld ratio between ir and uv , @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) , in the redshift range @xmath181 ( takeuchi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "they found that @xmath157 increases monotonically toward @xmath166 , which is the opposite trend to our result .",
    "however , more recent observational estimates for @xmath167 ( e.g. , murphy et al . 2011 ; casey et al .",
    "2012 ; cucciati et al . 2012 ) find that the redshift evolution of @xmath167 in this redshift range is milder than that reported by takeuchi et al .",

    "this interpretation will be examined as in our future work .      as described in section  [ subsec : corrdustatten ] , hb06 obtained the csfrd at @xmath71 by summing the uv data and fir measurements .",
    "they reported that this technique of uv@xmath169fir measurements gives an effective obscuration correction to the uv data by a factor of 2 at @xmath168 and @xmath170 ( i.e. , 1.7 mag ) at @xmath171 .",
    "it may be difficult to reconcile this with our result and should be examined in detail .",
    "however , the correction factor of @xmath170 at @xmath1 reported in hb06 might be overestimated for the following reason .",
    "hb06 performed the effective obscuration correction by just adding a constant csfrd measured by le floch et al .",

    "<S> the cosmic star formation rate density ( csfrd ) has been observationally investigated out to redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the theoretical models for galaxy formation underpredict the csfrd at @xmath1 . since the theoretical models reproduce the observed luminosity functions ( lfs ) , luminosity densities ( lds ) , and stellar mass density at each redshift , this inconsistency does not simply imply that theoretical models should incorporate some missing unknown physical processes in galaxy formation . here , we examine the cause of this inconsistency at uv wavelengths by using a mock catalog of galaxies generated by a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this inconsistency is due to two observational uncertainties : the dust obscuration correction and the conversion from uv luminosity to star formation rate ( sfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the methods for correction of obscuration and sfr conversion used in observational studies result in the overestimation of the csfrd by @xmath2@xmath3  dex and @xmath4@xmath5  dex , respectively , compared to the results obtained directly from our mock catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we present new empirical calibrations for dust attenuation and conversion from observed uv lfs and lds into the csfrd . </S>"
