    "this paper introduces a systematic way to compute conformal structures of general 2d surfaces , including computing holomorphic differentials , period matrices and conformal maps among surfaces . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first paper to give a set of practical algorithms to compute conformal structures for general closed meshes .",
    "this method has the potential to be generalized to work on meshes with boundaries and other representations of surfaces , such as implicit surfaces and level sets .",
    "computational conformal geometry is an active field in mathematical research .",
    "the following objects are equivalent to one another :    1 .",
    "compact riemann surfaces ; 2 .   projective algebraic curves ; 3 .   jacobian varieties of compact riemann surfaces .",
    "our goal is to computationally convert these different representations from one to another , and to compute conformal invariants and conformal mappings among surfaces .    in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "riemann surfaces are represented as algebraic curves or @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hyperbolic space and @xmath2 is a fuchsian group acting in @xmath1 .",
    "the homology bases are constructed as mobius transformations , then the holomorphic differentials are found by using algebraic geometry techniques on algebraic curves .",
    "finally the period matrices are computed explicitly by integrating holomorphic differentials on homology bases .    in real applications ,",
    "geometric surfaces are represented as meshes .",
    "it is rare to represent general surfaces as algebraic curves or quotient spaces . with",
    "the development of 3d data acquisition system , large scale meshes for real objects are becoming more and more common .",
    "the above methods for abstract representation of riemann surfaces can not be applied directly . in this paper , we assume the input data are general meshes and propose a systematic way to compute their conformal structures .    in  @xcite an algorithm is introduced to use circle packing to approximate conformal mappings between planar regions . for general surfaces , circle packing only considers topological structures but not geometric structures .",
    "it can not find the conformal mapping from a surface to the plane .",
    "however , if the triangulation is equilateral for each face , then the circle packing result is conformal .",
    "but , in general , such triangulation is difficult to construct .",
    "therefore , circle packing method is not appropriate for our purpose .    in computer graphics ,",
    "surface parametrization has been studied by many researchers .",
    "hoppe et al  @xcite use local harmonic maps for surface simplification and editing .",
    "haker et al  @xcite develop an algorithm to conformally map a genus zero surface to a sphere by solving a linear system .",
    "in haker et al  @xcite , the sphere is stereo - graphically projected to the complex plane implicitly .",
    "the stereo projection is nonlinear in nature , large errors are introduced in the neighborhood of the north pole by using piecewise linear mapping to approximate it in practice .    in @xcite , desbrun",
    "et al use conformal mapping to define geometry maps , where they compute the conformal maps from a topological disk to the complex plane .",
    "an equivalent algorithm is developed by maillot et al  @xcite , who use conformal mapping for the purpose of non - distorted texture - mapping .",
    "their method is based on riemann - cauchy equation .",
    "so far , although conformal mappings of genus zero surfaces have been studied , no one has tried to compute global conformal mapping for non zero genus surfaces .    in this paper , we solve the problem of computing conformal structure of surfaces thoroughly . for genus zero surfaces , we introduce a new method to construct conformal mappings from them to spheres directly .",
    "this method avoids the stereo projection and is more stable and more accurate .",
    "more importantly , this method can be generalized to compute conformal mappings between any arbitrary two genus zero surfaces . for surfaces with non zero genus ,",
    "the computation is much more complicated .",
    "we give a set of general algorithms to compute their conformal structures , which include ways to compute holomorphic differentials , period matrices and conformal mappings .",
    "a map between two surfaces is a conformal map if it just scales the first fundamental form and preserves angles everywhere .",
    "if there is an invertible conformal map between two surfaces and the inverse is also conformal , then we call these two surfaces conformally equivalent .",
    "the conformal automorphisms form a group .",
    "the invariants under conformal transformation group are called conformal structure .",
    "our goal is to compute these conformal structures . in terms of surface classification , conformally equivalent classes are finer than topologically equivalent classes and coarser than isometric classes .",
    "geometric objects classification and identification have been studied for years .",
    "but it is still an open problem today .",
    "it is challenging to classify general surfaces efficiently .",
    "a good algorithm should satisfy the following requirements : the method is intrisincly dependent of geometry and independent of triangulation ; the method is stable in the sense that perturbation of geometry perturbs the result continuously ; the method should also be robust enough to tolerate different resolution and boundaries ; for database indexing , each class index should be small for storage and easy to compute .",
    "conformal mapping has many nice properties and it is suitable for classification problems .",
    "conformal mapping only depends on the riemann metric and is independent of triangulation .",
    "conformal mapping is continuously dependent of riemann metric , so it works well for different resolutions .",
    "conformal invariants can be represented as a complex matrix , which can be easily stored and compared .",
    "we propose to use conformal structures to classify non - zero genus surfaces .",
    "for each conformally equivalent class , we can define canonical parametrization for the purpose of comparison .",
    "geometry matching can be formulated to find an isometry between 2 surfaces . by computing conformal parametrization ,",
    "the isometry can be obtained easily . for surfaces with close metric , conformal parametrization",
    "can also give the best geometric matching result .",
    "in this section , we give a brief summary of concepts and notations .",
