    "the similarity between the laws of black hole mechanics and those of ordinary thermodynamics is one of the most remarkable results to emerge from classical general relativity @xcite .",
    "however , the original framework was somewhat restricted and it is of considerable interest to extend it in certain directions , motivated by physical considerations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present one such extension .",
    "the zeroth and first laws refer to equilibrium situations and small departures therefrom .",
    "therefore , in this context , it is natural to focus on isolated black holes . in the standard treatments ,",
    "these are generally represented by _",
    "stationary _ solutions of field equations , i.e , solutions which admit a time - translational killing vector field _",
    "everywhere _ , not just in a small neighborhood of the black hole . while this simple idealization is a natural starting point , it seems to be overly restrictive .",
    "physically , it should be sufficient to impose boundary conditions at the horizon which ensure _ only that the black hole itself is isolated_. that is , it should suffice to demand only that the intrinsic geometry of the horizon be time independent , whereas the geometry outside may be dynamical and admit gravitational and other radiation .",
    "indeed , we adopt a similar viewpoint in ordinary thermodynamics ; in the standard description of equilibrium configurations of systems such as a classical gas , one usually assumes that only the system under consideration is in equilibrium and stationary , not the whole world . for black holes in realistic situations ,",
    "one is typically interested in the final stages of collapse where the black hole is formed and has ` settled down ' or in situations in which an already formed black hole is isolated for the duration of the experiment ( see figure 1 ) . in such situations , there is likely to be gravitational radiation and non - stationary matter far away from the black hole , whence the space - time as a whole is not expected to be stationary .",
    "surely , black hole mechanics should incorporate such situations .     + ( a )     of the horizon at late times is isolated .",
    "the space - time @xmath0 of interest is the triangular region bounded by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and a partial cauchy slice @xmath3 .",
    "( b)space - time diagram of a black hole which is initially in equilibrium , absorbs a small amount of radiation , and again settles down to equilibrium .",
    "portions @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the horizon are isolated.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + ( b )    a second limitation of the standard framework lies in its dependence on _ event _ horizons which can only be constructed retroactively , after knowing the _ complete _ evolution of space - time .",
    "consider for example , figure 2 in which a spherical star of mass @xmath3 undergoes a gravitational collapse .",
    "the singularity is hidden inside the null surface @xmath4 at @xmath6 which is foliated by a family of marginally trapped surfaces and would be a part of the event horizon if nothing further happens .",
    "suppose instead , after a very long time , a thin spherical shell of mass @xmath7 collapses",
    ". then @xmath4 would not be a part of the event horizon which would actually lie slightly outside @xmath4 and coincide with the surface @xmath8 in the distant future . on physical grounds",
    ", it seems unreasonable to exclude @xmath4 a priori from thermodynamical considerations .",
    "surely one should be able to establish the standard laws of mechanics not only for the event horizon but also for @xmath4 .",
    "another example is provided by cosmological horizons in de sitter space - time @xcite . in this case , there are no singularities or black - hole event horizons . on the other hand ,",
    "semi - classical considerations enable one to assign entropy and temperature to these horizons as well .",
    "this suggests the notion of event horizons is too restrictive for thermodynamical analogies .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case ; as far as equilibrium properties are concerned , the notion of event horizons can be replaced by a more general , quasi - local notion of ` isolated horizons ' for which the familiar laws continue to hold .",
    "the surface @xmath4 in figure 2 as well as the cosmological horizons in de sitter space - times are examples of isolated horizons .     undergoes collapse .",
    "later , a spherical shell of mass @xmath9 falls into the resulting black hole .",
    "while @xmath4 and @xmath5 are both isolated horizons , only @xmath5 is part of the event horizon.,height=151 ]    in addition to overcoming these two limitations , the framework presented here provides a natural point of departure for quantization and entropy calculations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , standard treatments of black hole mechanics are often based on differential geometric identities and are not well - suited to quantization .    at first sight",
    ", it may appear that only a small extension of the standard framework based on stationary event horizons is needed to overcome the limitations discussed above .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "for example , in the stationary context , one identifies the black - hole mass with the adm mass defined at spatial infinity . in the presence of radiation ,",
    "this simple strategy is no longer viable since even radiation fields well outside the horizon also contribute to the adm mass .",
    "hence , to formulate the first law , a new definition of the black hole mass is needed .",
    "similarly , in the absence of a globally defined killing field , we need to generalize the notion of surface gravity in a non - trivial fashion . indeed , even if space - time happens to be static in a neighborhood of the horizon  already a stronger condition than contemplated above",
    " the notion of surface gravity is ambiguous because the standard expression fails to be invariant under constant rescalings of the killing field . when a _",
    "global _ killing field exists , the ambiguity is removed by requiring the killing field be unit at _",
    "infinity_. thus , contrary to intuitive expectation ,",
    "the standard notion of the surface gravity of a stationary black hole refers not just to the structure at the horizon , but also to infinity .",
    "this ` normalization problem ' in the definition of the surface gravity seems especially difficult in the case of cosmological horizons in ( lorentzian ) space - times whose cauchy surfaces are compact .",
    "apart from these conceptual problems , a host of technical issues must also be resolved . in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory , the space of stationary black hole solutions is finite - dimensional whereas the space of solutions admitting isolated horizons is _",
    "infinite_-dimensional since these solutions also admit radiation . as a result ,",
    "the introduction of a well - defined action principle is subtle and the hamiltonian framework acquires qualitatively new features .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we recall the formulation of general relativity in terms of @xmath10-spin soldering forms and self - dual connections for asymptotically flat space - times _ without _ internal boundaries . in section [ s3 ] , we specify the boundary conditions which define non - rotating isolated horizons and discuss several examples . the primary focus in section 3 , as in the rest of the paper , is on einstein ",
    "maxwell theory , although more general matter is also considered .",
    "the consequences of these boundary conditions which are needed to obtain the laws governing isolated horizons are discussed in section [ s4 ] .",
    "using this structure , we introduce in section [ s5 ] the notion of the surface gravity @xmath11 of an isolated horizon without any reference to infinity and prove the zeroth law .",
    "the action principle and the hamiltonian formulation are discussed in section [ s6 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian has a bulk term and two surface terms , one at infinity and the other at the isolated horizon @xmath1 .",
    "the bulk term is the standard linear combination of constraints and the surface term at infinity yields the adm energy . in section [ s7 ] , we argue the horizon surface term in the hamiltonian should be identified with the mass @xmath12 of the isolated horizon . in particular , in the situation depicted in figure 1(a ) we show @xmath12 is the difference between the adm energy and the energy radiated away through all of null infinity ( provided certain assumptions on the structure at @xmath13 hold ) .",
    "that is , although the definition of @xmath12 uses only the structure available at the horizon , it equals the future limit of the bondi mass defined entirely on @xmath2 in the case under consideration .",
    "this is precisely what one might expect on physical grounds in the presence of radiation .",
    "finally , having @xmath11 and @xmath12 at our disposal , we establish the first law in section [ s8 ] .    the overall viewpoint and the boundary conditions of section [ s3 ] are closely related to those introduced by hayward in an interesting series of papers @xcite which also aims at providing a more physical framework for discussing black holes .",
    "there is also an inevitable overlap between this paper and @xcite in which a hamiltonian framework ( in terms of _ real _ @xmath14 connections ) is constructed with an eye towards quantization .",
    "however , by and large the results presented here are complementary to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "even when there is an overlap , the material is presented from a different angle .",
    "the relation between these three papers is discussed in section [ s9 ] .",
    "technical , background material needed at various stages is collected in the three appendices .",
    "a brief summary of our main results was given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will use the formulation of general relativity as a dynamical theory of connections @xcite rather than metrics .",
    "classically , the theory is unchanged by the shift to connection variables .",
    "however , at present the connection variables appear to be indispensable for non - perturbative quantization @xcite .",
    "in particular , the entropy calculation for isolated horizons has been carried out only within this framework @xcite .",
    "therefore , for uniformity , we will use the connection variables in the main body of this paper .",
    "however , as indicated in section [ s9 ] , all these results can also be derived in the framework of tetrad dynamics .    in order to fix notation and conventions and to acquaint the reader with the basics of connection dynamics",
    ", we will provide here a brief review of this formulation in an asymptotically flat space - time without interior boundary .",

    "the equations of motion are just hamilton s equations : @xmath74 these are the field equations ( [ eom2 ] ) and ( [ maxeq ] ) in a 3 + 1 form , expressed in terms of the canonical variables .",
    "to conclude , we note two modifications which occur if the cosmological constant is non - zero .",
    "first , there is an extra term proportional to @xmath75 $ ] in the action ( [ afact ] ) , where @xmath76 is the cosmological constant .",
    "this contributes a term proportional to @xmath77 in the bulk term of the hamiltonian ( [ afphsp ] ) .",
    "second , the boundary conditions are modified .",
    "if @xmath76 is positive , it is natural to assume the cauchy surfaces are compact , whence there are no falloff conditions or boundary terms in any of the expressions .",
    "if @xmath76 is negative , the dynamical fields approach asymptotically their values in the anti - de sitter space - time @xcite .",
    "in this section , we specify the boundary conditions which define an _ undistorted , non - rotating isolated horizon_. as explained in the introduction , the purpose of these boundary conditions is to capture the essential features of a non - rotating , isolated black hole in terms of the intrinsic structure available at the horizon , without any reference to infinity or to a static killing field in space - time .",
    "however , the boundary conditions model a larger variety of situations . for example , the cosmological horizons in de sitter space - times @xcite are isolated horizons , even though there is no sense in which they describe a black hole . as a result",
    ", the usual mechanics of cosmological horizons will be reproduced within the framework of isolated horizons .",
    "other examples involve space - times admitting gravitational and electro - magnetic radiation such as those described in section [ s3.2 ] .",
    "the physical situation we wish to model is illustrated by the example of figure [ exam](a ) .",
    "the late stages of the collapse pictured here should describe a non - dynamical , isolated black hole .",
    "however , a realistic collapse will generate gravitational radiation which must either be scattered back into the black hole or radiated to infinity .",
    "physically , one expects most of the back - scattered radiation will be absorbed rather quickly and , in the absence of outside perturbations , the black hole will ` settle down ' to a steady - state configuration .",
    "this picture is supported by numerical simulations .",
    "the continued presence of radiation elsewhere in space - time however implies @xmath0 can not be stationary . as a result , the usual formulations of black hole mechanics in terms of stationary solutions can not be easily applied to this type of physical black hole . nevertheless ,",
    "since the portion @xmath1 of the horizon describes an isolated black hole one would hope to be able to formulate the laws of black hole mechanics in this context .",
    "we will see in sections 5 and 8 that this is indeed the case .",
    "we are now in a position to state our boundary conditions . since this paper is concerned primarily with the mechanics of isolated horizons in einstein ",
    "maxwell space - times , conditions on gravitational and maxwell fields are specified first and more general matter fields are treated afterwards .",

    "( while the @xmath111 topology is the most interesting one from physical considerations , most of our results go through if @xmath112 is replaced by a compact , 2-manifold of higher genus .",

    "the meaning of the preferred foliation of @xmath1 will be made clear in the discussion of condition [ bcgeom ] below .",
    "the meaning of the preferred ruling can be seen immediately in condition [ bcnull ] which simply requires that @xmath1 be a null surface , and @xmath81 $ ] its null generator .",
    "thus , the preferred ruling singles out the null generators of the horizon .",
    "condition [ bcdynam ] is a fairly generic dynamical condition , completely analogous to the one usually imposed at null infinity : _ any _ set of boundary conditions must be consistent with the equations of the motion at the horizon .",
    "it is likely that this condition can be weakened , e.g. , by requiring only that the pull - backs to @xmath1 of the equations of motion should hold .",

    "it is condition [ bcgeom ] which endows @xmath1 with the structure of an isolated horizon .",

    "the only independent consequence of condition [ bcgeom ] for @xmath115 is its vanishing divergence ; the rest then follows from simple geometry .",
    "the vanishing divergence of @xmath115 is equivalent to the vanishing expansion of the horizon , we will see in section [ s4.1 ] that this implies there is no flux of matter falling across @xmath1 , which in turn captures the idea that the horizon is isolated .",
    "collectively , the consequences of condition [ bcgeom ] for @xmath116 imply the horizon is non - rotating and its intrinsic geometry is undistorted . requiring @xmath102 to be nowhere",
    "vanishing is equivalent to requiring the expansion of @xmath116 to be nowhere vanishing . in black - hole space - times",
    ", we expect this expansion to be strictly negative on future horizons and strictly positive on past horizons .",
    "on cosmological horizons , both signs are permissible . in section [ s6 ]",
    "we will impose further restrictions tailored to different physical situations .",
    "finally , it is easy to verify that these conditions on @xmath116 suffice to single out the preferred foliation of @xmath1 . _",
    "thus , we could have just required the existence of a foliation satisfying the first three conditions , and used [ bcgeom ] to conclude the foliation is unique . _    next , let us discuss the condition [ bcmaxsym ] on the maxwell field . at first sight",
    ", this requirement seems to be a severe restriction .",
    "however , if the newman - penrose component @xmath119 of the electro - magnetic field , representing ` the radiation field traversing @xmath1 ' , vanishes in a neighborhood of @xmath1 and boundary conditions i through iv hold , then @xmath120 automatically satisfies [ bcmaxsym ] .",
    "heuristically , this feature can be understood as follows . from the definition of @xmath120 in ( [ emcon ] ) , one can see condition [ bcmaxsym ] requires the electric and magnetic fluxes across the horizon to be spherically symmetric .",
    "if this condition did not hold , one would intuitively expect a non - rotating black hole to radiate away the asphericities in its electro - magnetic hair , giving rise to a non - vanishing @xmath119 .",

    "conditions [ bcmaxeq ] and [ bcmaxsym ] refer to the maxwell field ; the rest involve only the gravitational degrees of freedom and are independent of the matter fields present at the horizon .",
    "we will now indicate how these two conditions must be modified in the presence of more general forms of matter .",
    "( for a discussion of dilatonic couplings , see @xcite . )",
    "first , note that condition [ bcdynam ] is unambiguous .",
    "hence , [ bcmaxeq ] would simply be replaced with the field equations of the relevant matter .",
    "condition [ bcmaxsym ] , on the other hand , is more subtle .",
    "in fact , there is no universal analog of ( [ emcon ] ) which applies to arbitrary matter fields ; the boundary conditions used in place of condition [ bcmaxsym ] may vary from case to case .",
    "there are , however , two general properties which any candidate matter field and its associated boundary conditions must possess :    1 .   [ bcgenmat ] for any @xmath114 $ ]",
    ", a matter field must satisfy 1 .",
    "[ bcenergy ] _ the stress - energy tensor is such that @xmath121 is _ causal _ ,",
    "i.e. , future - directed , time - like or null_. 2 .",
    "[ bcfldsym ] _ the quantity @xmath122 is spherically symmetric on @xmath1_.    the first of these properties , [ bcenergy ] , is an immediate consequence of the ( much stronger ) dominant energy condition which demands @xmath123 be causal for _ any _ causal vector @xmath124 . like any energy condition ,",
    "this is a restriction on the _ types _ of matter which may be present near the horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "the property [ bcfldsym ] is a restriction on the possible _ boundary conditions _ which may be imposed on matter fields at the horizon .",
    "we conclude this section with a remark on generalizations of these boundary conditions . although our framework is geared to the undistorted , non - rotating case , only the requirements on @xmath116 in condition [ bcgeom ] and the symmetry condition [ bcmaxsym ] on the maxwell field would have to be weakened to accommodate distortion and rotation @xcite .",
    "specifically , it appears that , in presence of distortion , @xmath102 will not be spherically symmetric and in presence of rotation @xmath125 will not vanish .",
    "however , it appears that a more general procedure discovered by lewandowski will enable one to introduce a preferred foliation of @xmath1 and naturally extend the present framework to allow for distortion and rotation .",
    "finally , in light of the sphericity conditions on @xmath126 and @xmath120 , one may be tempted to call our isolated horizons ` spherical ' .",
    "however , the newman - penrose curvature components @xmath127 and @xmath128 and the maxwell field component @xmath129 need not be spherical on @xmath1 for our boundary conditions to be satisfied .",
    "therefore , the adjectives ` undistorted and non - rotating ' appear to be better suited to characterize our isolated horizons .",
    "it is easy to check that all of these boundary conditions hold at the event horizons of reissner  nordstrm black hole solutions ( with or without a cosmological constant ) .",
    "similarly , they hold at cosmological horizons in de sitter space - time . furthermore ,",
    "if one considers a spherical collapse , as in figure 2 , they hold both on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( at suitably late times ) .    in the non - rotating context",
    ", these cases already include situations normally considered in connection with black hole thermodynamics . however , the isolated horizons in these examples are also killing horizons for globally defined , static killing fields .",

    ", there is a unique solution ( modulo diffeomorphisms ) to the vacuum einstein s equations in a neighborhood of @xmath132 bounded by ( and including ) the appropriate portions of @xmath1 and @xmath131 .",
    "let us set @xmath136 on @xmath1 and @xmath137 on @xmath132 , @xmath138 and @xmath135 to be a ( round ) 2-sphere metric with area @xmath139 on @xmath132 .",
    "lewandowski @xcite has shown that , in the resulting solution , @xmath1 is an isolated horizon with area @xmath139 .",
    "note that in the resulting solution @xmath128 need not vanish in any neighborhood of @xmath1 , or , indeed , even _ on _ @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in the vacuum case , there is an infinite - dimensional space of ( local ) solutions containing isolated horizons .",
    "it turns out that , in this setting , there is always a vector field @xmath140 in a neighborhood of @xmath1 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "however , in general @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the weyl tensor of @xmath28 .",
    "hence , in general , @xmath140 can not be a killing field of @xmath28 even in a neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "( for details , see @xcite . ) the robinson ",
    "trautman solutions provide interesting examples of exact solutions which bring out this point @xcite : a sub - class of these solutions admit an isolated horizon but no killing fields whatsoever .",
    "there is radiation in every neighborhood of the isolated horizon but , in a natural chart , the metric coefficients and several of their radial derivatives evaluated _ at _ @xmath1 are the same as those of the schwarzschild metric at its event horizon",
    ".    a second class of examples can be constructed by starting with killing horizons and ` adding radiation ' . to be specific ,",

    "maxwell case , one can use the strategy introduced by cutler and wald @xcite in their proof of existence of solutions with smooth null infinity . in the vacuum case",
    ", one can use the more general ` gluing methods ' recently introduced by corvino and schoen @xcite to show that there exists an infinite - dimensional space of asymptotically flat initial data on @xmath3 which agree with the data for a schwarzschild space - time for @xmath147 but in which the evolved space - time admits radiation . using these methods ,",
    "one would be able to construct ` triangular regions ' @xmath148 bounded by @xmath3 , @xmath1 and a partial cauchy slice @xmath149 in the future of @xmath3 .",
    "if one takes @xmath148 as the space - time of interest , then @xmath1 would serve as the isolated horizon at the inner boundary . due to the presence of radiation",
    ", @xmath15 will not admit any global killing field .",
    "however , in a neighborhood of @xmath1 , the 4-metric will be isometric to that of schwarzschild space - time .",
    "thus , in this case , there will in fact be four killing fields in a neighborhood of the isolated horizon .",
    "the two constructions discussed above are complementary .",
    "the first yields more general isolated horizons but the final result is local .",
    "the second would provide space - times which extend from the isolated horizon @xmath1 to infinity but in which there is no radiation in a neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "we expect there will exist an infinite - dimensional space of solutions to the vacuum einstein equations and einstein ",
    "maxwell equations which are free from both limitations , i.e. , which extend to spatial infinity and admit isolated horizons with radiation arbitrarily close to them",
    ". however , a comprehensive treatment of this issue will be technically difficult . given the current status of global existence and uniqueness results in the asymptotically flat contexts , the present limitations are not surprising .",
    "indeed , the situation at null infinity is somewhat analogous : while the known techniques have provided several interesting partial results , they do not yet allow us to show that there exists a large class of solutions to einstein s vacuum equations which admit complete and smooth past and future null infinities , @xmath150 and the standard structure at spatial infinity , @xmath151 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the rich structure given to the horizon by the boundary conditions .",
    "the discussion is divided into four subsections .",
    "the first describes the basic geometry of an isolated horizon .",
    "the next two subsections examine the restrictions on the space - time curvature and maxwell field which arise from the boundary conditions .",
    "the last subsection contains a brief summary .",
    "let us begin by examining the consequences of condition iii in the main definition .",
    "the condition on @xmath152 immediately implies @xmath153 for some 1-form @xmath154 on @xmath1 .",
    "hence , @xmath115 is geodesic , twist - free , shear - free and divergence - free .",
    "we will denote the acceleration of @xmath115 by @xmath155 : @xmath156 so that @xmath157 .",
    "note that @xmath158 varies with the rescaling of @xmath115 .",
    "actually , the geodesic and the twist - free properties of @xmath115 follow already from condition ii which requires @xmath1 to be a null surface with @xmath115 as its null normal . furthermore , since @xmath159 by condition [ bcenergy ] , and einstein s equations hold at @xmath1 ( condition ivb ) , we can use the raychaudhuri equation @xmath160 to conclude the shear @xmath161 must vanish if the expansion @xmath162 vanishes .",
    "thus , the only independent assumption contained in the first of equations ( [ derivcon ] ) in condition iii is that @xmath115 is expansion - free , which captures the idea that @xmath1 is an _ isolated _ horizon .",
    "finally , note that the raychaudhuri equation also implies that @xmath163 i.e. , that there is no flux of matter energy - momentum across the horizon .",
    "let us now consider the properties of the vector field @xmath116 .",
    "the second equation in ( [ derivcon ] ) implies @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "hence , @xmath116 is twist - free , shear - free , has spherically symmetric expansion , @xmath166 , and vanishing newman - penrose coefficient @xmath167 .",
    "the twist - free property follows from the very definition of @xmath168 , but the other three properties originate in condition iii of the definition .",
    "next we turn to the intrinsic geometry of the horizon . using the definitions ( [ fullbase ] ) of the co - vectors @xmath169 and @xmath170 , one can show there exists a 1-form @xmath171 on @xmath1 such that @xmath172 one consequence of these relations is that the lie derivative along @xmath115 of the intrinsic metric on @xmath1 must vanish : @xmath173 .",
    "thus , as mentioned in section 3 , the intrinsic geometry of an isolated horizon is ` time - independent ' .",
    "in particular , the lie derivative along @xmath115 of the volume form on the foliation 2-spheres @xmath78 vanishes : @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , the areas of all the @xmath78 take the same value which we denote @xmath139 .",
    "finally , one can show @xcite the scalar curvature @xmath175 of the 2-sphere cross sections @xmath78 is related to the 4-dimensional , newman - penrose curvature scalars via : @xmath176 . in section [ s5 ]",
    ", it is shown that the quantity on the right side of this equation is constant on @xmath78 . hence , the intrinsic metric @xmath177 on @xmath78 is spherically symmetric . in this sense ,",
    "the horizon geometry is undistorted .",
    "however , the discussion of section [ s3.2 ] shows spherical symmetry will not extend , in general , to a neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "let us begin by exploring the effects of boundary condition [ bcgenmat ] on the form of the ricci tensor . using the raychaudhuri equation , we have derived ( [ rayres ] ) .",
    "whence @xmath178 in ( [ strencon ] ) must be proportional to @xmath115 . using the quantity @xmath179 defined in ( [ endenscon ] )",
    ", we then have @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the scalar curvature .",
    "this formula yields a series of results for the ricci tensor . in terms of newman - penrose components ( [ npphi ] ) , these read @xmath182 the first three results say , by way of the einstein equation , there is no flux of matter radiation falling through the isolated horizon .",
    "the fourth result implies the combination @xmath183 is spherically symmetric .",
    "we can now explore the consequences of the condition iii for the full riemann curvature . since any @xmath184-bundle over a 3-manifold is trivializable , and",
    "since our 4-manifold @xmath15 has the topology @xmath185 for some 3-manifold @xmath3 , the connection @xmath25 can be represented globally as a lie algebra - valued 1-form . because of ( [ derivcon ] ) , in the @xmath186-basis , the pull - back to @xmath1 of that connection must have the form @xmath187 on @xmath1 .",
    "( however , since the spin - dyad is defined only locally on @xmath1 , the decomposition ( [ connform ] ) is also local . )",
    "the function @xmath102 appearing here is the same nowhere vanishing , spherically symmetric function introduced in ( [ derivcon ] ) and @xmath155 and @xmath188 are defined by ( [ kapdef ] ) and ( [ nudef ] ) , respectively .",
    "now , using this expression for the pull - back of the self - dual connection , we can simply calculate the pull - back of its curvature to be @xmath189 \\iota_{(a } o_{b ) } + [ ( \\tilde{\\kappa } \\mu + \\lie_\\ell \\mu ) n \\wedge \\bar m ] o_a o_b,\\ ] ] where we have suppressed all space - time indices for simplicity . on the other hand",
    ", we can also calculate the self - dual part of the riemann spinor in terms of newman - penrose components ( see appendix [ curvapp ] ) .",
    "then , using the compatibility of the self - dual connection with the soldering form at the horizon , we get a second expression for the pulled - back curvature : @xmath190 \\iota_a \\iota_b \\\\ - { } &",
    "\\left [ \\phi_{10 } n \\wedge m + \\psi_1 n \\wedge \\bar m - \\left ( \\psi_2 - \\phi_{11 } - \\frac{r}{24 } \\right ) m \\wedge \\bar m \\right ] 2 \\iota_{(a } o_{b ) } \\\\ + { } & \\left [ \\phi_{20 } n \\wedge m + \\left ( \\psi_2 + \\frac{r}{12 } \\right )   n \\wedge \\bar m - ( \\psi_3 - \\phi_{21 } ) m \\wedge \\bar m \\right ] o_a o_b.\\\\    \\end{eqtableau}\\ ] ] equating this expression with ( [ curvform ] ) one arrives at a series of conclusions :    1 .",
    "since there is no @xmath191 term in ( [ curvform ] ) , we find @xmath192 where we have used ( [ zeroflux ] ) .",
    "2 .   equating the @xmath193 terms in the two expressions and using ( [ psizero ] ) and ( [ zeroflux ] )",
    "then yields @xmath194 the first expression here says the function @xmath155 is spherically symmetric . in the second expression ,",
    "the left side is real and the quantity @xmath195 on the right is real as well . as a result , the coefficient @xmath196 must be real .",
    "however , @xmath197 is manifestly real and , due to its definition ( [ npphi ] ) , @xmath198 is also real .",
    "thus , the second expression in ( [ abcurv ] ) implies the imaginary part of @xmath199 vanishes .",
    "this encodes the property that @xmath1 is non - rotating .",
    "equating the remaining @xmath200 terms similarly yields @xmath201 and @xmath202 as well as @xmath203 since @xmath102 and @xmath158 are spherically symmetric , @xmath204 must also have this property .    in the later sections of this paper , we will consider the action and phase space formulations of systems containing isolated horizons . in this discussion , it will be most useful to have a formula giving the relations which arise from the boundary conditions among the fundamental gravitational degrees of freedom in a simple , compact form . using ( [ curvpb ] ) , the tetrad decomposition ( [ sigcomp ] ) of @xmath205 and the above restrictions on the newman - penrose curvature components , it is straightforward to demonstrate : @xmath206 \\pback{\\sigma}^{cd}.\\ ] ] in the phase space formalism , only the pull - back to @xmath78 of this formula will be relevant .",
    "this pull - back takes the simpler form @xmath207{f}^{ab } \\hateq \\left ( { \\psi_2 - \\phi_{11 } - \\frac{r}{24 } }   \\right ) \\ , \\pback[2]{\\sigma}^{ab}.\\ ] ] note that the essential content of this equation can be seen already in ( [ abcurv ] ) .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of a maxwell field is given by @xmath208.\\ ] ] this stress - energy tensor satisfies the dominant energy condition and hence , in particular , condition [ bcenergy ] .",
    "furthermore , one can see from its definition that the trace of @xmath39 is zero .    to see the restrictions which the boundary conditions place on the maxwell field , it is useful to recast this discussion in terms of spinors as we did in the previous subsection for the self - dual curvature .",
    "the maxwell spinor @xmath209 is defined in terms of the field strength via the relation @xmath210 it is then straightforward to show that the stress - energy ( [ maxstren ] ) can be expressed in terms of the maxwell spinor as @xmath211 we have already seen in the previous subsections that the general matter field conditions , [ bcgenmat ] , and the raychaudhuri equation imply the stress energy tensor must satisfy ( [ strennull ] ) . using the spinorial definition ( [ nullbase ] ) of @xmath115 , this restriction on the stress - energy tensor gives two important results for the maxwell field : @xmath212 here , @xmath213 is the quantity @xmath179 introduced in ( [ endenscon ] ) specialized to the maxwell field .",
    "the second equation shows the spherical symmetry of @xmath120 we imposed in ( [ emcon ] ) does indeed guarantee the spherical symmetry of @xmath213 required by ( [ endenscon ] ) .",
    "however , the remaining newman - penrose component of the maxwell field , @xmath129 , is completely unconstrained .",
    "in particular , it need not be spherically symmetric .",
    "since @xmath120 is spherically symmetric , we can express it in terms of the electric and magnetic charges contained within the horizon . to do so , consider the general form of the maxwell field compatible with ( [ maxspinres ] ) : @xmath214 here , @xmath215 denotes the volume form on @xmath78 and @xmath216 denotes its ( space - time ) dual . now , since @xmath215 is defined with respect to the _ inward _ pointing unit space - like normal ( see appendix [ conv ] ) , we have    [ charge ] -4q_&_s",
    "_ ^ -2 _ s _ ^2 < > + -4p_&_s _ -2 _ s _ ^2 < > , +    where @xmath217 and @xmath218 denote the electric and magnetic charges contained _ within _ @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath120 is spherically symmetric , its real and imaginary parts can be pulled outside the integrals and we calculate it to be @xmath219 here , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are naturally spherically symmetric , but may as yet vary from one @xmath78 to another .",
    "however , the remaining boundary condition on the maxwell field , ( [ bcmaxeq ] ) , requires the maxwell equations hold at the horizon .",
    "the maxwell equations pulled - back to @xmath1 applied to the field strength ( [ maxtensres ] ) with @xmath120 given by ( [ npcharge ] ) imply the charges @xmath217 and @xmath218 must be constant over the entire horizon @xmath1 . it should be noted that this constancy is caused by _",
    "boundary conditions _ and not by equations of motion in the bulk . as a result ,",
    "@xmath217 and @xmath218 are constant over @xmath1 in any history satisfying our boundary conditions and not just ` on - shell ' .",
    "as we have seen in this section , the boundary conditions place many restrictions on both the gravitational and electro - magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "we will collect the results we have found here .",
    "these results use not only the boundary conditions , but also the fact that the only form of matter we consider is a maxwell field .",
    "the newman - penrose components of the maxwell field at the horizon are constrained by @xmath220 the remaining component , @xmath129 , is an arbitrary complex function over @xmath1 .",
    "the newman - penrose components of the ricci tensor are @xmath221 the second equation is simply a consequence of the einstein equation and ( [ spinstren ] ) .",
    "the newman - penrose components of the weyl tensor satisfy @xmath222 the component @xmath128 is an arbitrary complex function over @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining component , @xmath199 , is related to the acceleration @xmath155 of @xmath115 and the expansion @xmath166 of @xmath116 via : @xmath223 where @xmath76 is the cosmological constant .",
    "it follows in particular that @xmath199 is real and spherically symmetric .",
    "finally , these components also satisfy @xmath224 where @xmath188 is a connection on the frame bundle of @xmath78 and @xmath215 is its volume form .",
    "the zeroth law of black hole mechanics states that the surface gravity @xmath11 of a stationary black hole is constant over its horizon . in subsection",
    "[ redgauge ] , we will extend the standard definition of @xmath11 to arbitrary non - rotating isolated horizons using only structure available at the horizon .",
    "a key test of the usefulness of this definition comes from the zeroth law : does the structure of @xmath1 enable us to conclude @xmath11 is constant on @xmath1 without reference to a static killing field ? in section [ s5.2 ] we will show the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "thus , our more general definition of surface gravity is consistent with our notion of isolation of the horizon .",
    "furthermore , we will see that the structure of @xmath1 is rich enough to enable us to express @xmath11 in terms of the parameters @xmath225 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 of the isolated horizon .",
    "our set - up suggests we define surface gravity using the acceleration , @xmath155 , of the vector field @xmath115 .",
    "however , since the acceleration fails to be invariant under the rescalings of @xmath115 , we need to normalize @xmath115 appropriately .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the usual treatments of black hole mechanics in static space - times accomplish this by identifying @xmath115 with the restriction to the horizon of that static killing field which is unit at infinity . for a generic isolated horizon , there will be no such killing field and our procedure can only involve structures defined _ on _ the horizon . since @xmath115 is null , and its expansion , twist and shear vanish , we can not hope to normalize it by fixing one of its own geometric characteristics .",
    "however , the normalizations of @xmath115 and @xmath116 are intertwined and we _ can _ hope to normalize @xmath116 by fixing its expansion . the normalization of @xmath115 will then be fixed .    to implement this strategy ,",
    "let us begin by examining the available gauge freedom .",
    "the correspondence ( [ nullbase ] ) between the fixed spin dyad @xmath113 and the preferred direction fields @xmath226 $ ] breaks the original @xmath184 internal gauge group at @xmath1 to @xmath227 .",
    "however , as we shall see shortly , the residual gauge invariance has a somewhat unusual structure . to see the nature of the residual gauge , it is simplest temporarily to consider a fixed soldering form and a variable spin dyad .",
    "the most general transformation of the spin dyad which preserves the correspondence ( [ nullbase ] ) is @xmath228 here , @xmath229 and @xmath230 are both real functions over @xmath1 . under these residual gauge transformations , one can show the null tetrad transforms as @xmath231 thus , @xmath229 accounts for the rescaling freedom in @xmath115 and @xmath168 which must be eliminated to define the surface gravity unambiguously .",
    "@xmath229 is restricted to be spherically symmetric by ( [ equivrel ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath230 is arbitrary and allows a general transformation on the frame bundle of each @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath102 appearing in ( [ derivcon ] ) is not gauge invariant , but transforms according to @xmath232 note , however , that the spherical symmetry and nowhere - vanishing property of @xmath102 are preserved by this transformation .",
    "finally , the fields @xmath155 and @xmath188 introduced in section [ s4.1 ] transform as @xmath233 the transformation of @xmath155 is the usual one for the acceleration of a vector field when that field is rescaled , and preserves the spherical symmetry of @xmath155 . meanwhile",
    ", the transformation of @xmath171 is that of a @xmath234 connection .",
    "we are now ready to fix the normalization of @xmath115 .",
    "the strategy outlined in the beginning of this subsection can be implemented successfully thanks to the following three non - trivial facts .",
    "first , the expansion of the properly normalized @xmath116 in a reissner ",
    "nordstrm solution is ` universal ' : irrespective of the mass , electric and magnetic charges or cosmological constant , on the future , outer black hole event horizons in these solutions , @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the radius of the horizon .",
    "motivated by this and the relation @xmath237 ( see ( [ expnf ] ) ) we are led to set to be strictly positive .",
    "this issue will be discussed in section [ s6 ] . for",
    "now , we focus on black hole horizons and assume @xmath102 is strictly negative .",
    "modifications required to accommodate positive @xmath102 are straightforward . ] @xmath238 on a _ generic _ , non - rotating , einstein  maxwell isolated horizon of radius @xmath239 ( i.e. , of area @xmath240 ) .",
    "second , the gauge - freedom ( [ tetgauge ] ) available to us is such that we can _ always _ achieve the normalization ( [ fixreal ] ) of @xmath102 .",
    "third , it is obvious from ( [ expngauge ] ) that this condition exhausts the freedom in @xmath229 completely . in particular",
    ", therefore , in a single stroke , this procedure fixes the normalization of @xmath116 ( and @xmath115 ) _ and _ gets rid of the awkwardness in the gauge freedom .",
    "the restricted gauge freedom is now given simply by : @xmath241 where @xmath230 is an arbitrary real function on @xmath1 ; the local gauge group is reduced to @xmath242 .",
    "we can now return to our usual convention wherein the spin dyad is fixed while the soldering form varies .",
    "the true residual gauge transformations are then the duals of ( [ actgauge ] ) , with @xmath243 , acting on the soldering form .",
    "the effect of these residual transformations on the null tetrad and the other fields discussed here remain the same as those in ( [ tetgauge2 ] ) .    from now on",
    ", we will assume that @xmath116 and @xmath115 are normalized via ( [ fixreal ] ) , denote the resulting acceleration of @xmath115 by @xmath11 and refer to it as the _ surface gravity of the isolated horizon _ @xmath1 . by construction",
    ", our general definition reduces to the standard one in reissner  nordstrm solutions .    to conclude this subsection ,",
    "let us consider the gauge freedom in maxwell theory .",
    "we just saw that a partial gauge fixing of the @xmath184 freedom in the gravitational sector is necessary to define the surface gravity in the absence of a static killing field .",
    "the situation with the electric and magnetic potentials is analogous . in conventional treatments @xcite",
    "these can be defined using the global static killing field which , however , is unavailable for a generic isolated horizon .",
    "the idea again is to resolve this problem through a partial gauge fixing .",
    "since the only available parameters are the radius @xmath225 and the charges @xmath244 , dimensional considerations suggest the electric potential @xmath245 is proportional to @xmath246 on the horizon .",
    "we fix the proportionality factor using the standard value of @xmath247 in reissner  nordstrm solutions .",
    "thus , in the general case , we partially fix the gauge by requiring @xmath248 it turns out that this strategy of gauge - fixing also makes the variational principle well - defined for the maxwell action .",
    "the situation with the magnetic potential , however , is more subtle .",
    "since there is no obvious expression for the magnetic potential in terms of @xmath19 , we can not formulate a definition similar to ( [ fixmax ] ) .",
    "instead , we will appeal to the well - known duality symmetry of the maxwell field .",
    "thus , in the remainder of the paper , we set @xmath249 _ in the main discussion_. the results for isolated horizons with both electric and magnetic charge will follow from those including only electric charge by a duality rotation .",
    "we already know from ( [ abcurv ] ) that @xmath11 is spherically symmetric .",
    "therefore , to establish the zeroth law , it only remains to show that @xmath250 also vanishes .",
    "recall first from ( [ actbc ] ) that on @xmath1 , @xmath251 is given by : @xmath252 \\pback{\\sigma}^{cd}.\\ ] ] let us now consider the bianchi identity @xmath253 .",
    "transvecting it with @xmath254 , we obtain @xmath255 in the einstein  maxwell system , @xmath256 and @xmath120 is constant on @xmath1 ( see ( [ npcharge ] ) ) .",
    "similarly , since the stress - energy tensor is trace - free , @xmath257 is also a constant .",
    "hence it follows that @xmath258 .",
    "finally , ( [ psi2prime ] ) and our gauge condition ( [ fixreal ] ) immediately imply : @xmath259 hence , we conclude @xmath260 , as desired .",
    "this establishes the zeroth law of the mechanics of isolated horizons in the einstein  maxwell theory .",
    "we will now obtain an explicit expression for @xmath11 in terms of the parameters of this isolated horizon .",
    "the key fact is that the first chern number of the pull - back to @xmath78 of the connection @xmath188 introduced in ( [ nudef ] ) is two .",
    "this can be seen in a number of ways , but it is essentially equivalent to the gauss - bonet theorem for a 2-sphere because @xmath261{\\nu}$ ] can be identified with a @xmath262 connection in the frame bundle of @xmath78 .",
    "using this property , we have @xmath263 \\cdot \\tensor ^2<\\epsilon>,\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ abcurv ] ) in the last equality here .",
    "now , we have seen in ( [ kapcurv ] ) that the first term in the brackets here is spherically symmetric , and in ( [ zeroflux ] ) that the second term is proportional to the quantity @xmath179 which has been restricted to be spherically symmetric . as a result",
    ", the entire integrand on the right side of [ chern ] can be pulled through the integral .",
    "the remaining integral simply gives the area @xmath139 of @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath264 let us now specialize to the einstein  maxwell case .",
    "then , @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "therefore , using ( [ psi2 ] ) we can express surface gravity in terms of @xmath225 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 : @xmath267 we conclude with a few remarks .",
    "to 0pt1 . the final expression ( [ surfgrav ] ) for @xmath11 is formally identical to the expression for the surface gravity of a reissner  nordstrm black hole in terms of its radius and charge .",
    "this may be surprising since we have not restricted ourselves to static situations .",
    "however , if it is possible to express @xmath11 in terms of the parameters @xmath225 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath76 alone , this agreement _ must _ hold if the general expression is to reduce to the standard one on event horizons of static black holes . in our treatment",
    ", the agreement can be technically traced back to our general strategy for fixing the normalization of @xmath115 .    to 0pt2 .",
    "it may also be surprising that , although we do not have a static killing field at our disposal , it was possible to define @xmath11 unambiguously and it turned out to satisfy the zeroth law .",
    "furthermore , we could express @xmath11 in terms of the parameters of the isolated horizon , irrespective of the details of gravitational and electro - magnetic radiation outside the horizon .",
    "this was possible because of two facts .",
    "first , the boundary conditions could successfully extract just that structure from static black holes which is relevant for these thermodynamical considerations .",
    "second , at its core , the zeroth law is really local to the horizon ; it does not know , nor care , about the space - time geometry away from the horizon .",
    "physically , this meets one s expectation that the degrees of freedom of a black hole in equilibrium should ` decouple ' from the excitations present elsewhere in space - time .    to 0pt3 .",
    "our expression ( [ kapcurv ] ) of surface gravity in terms of weyl and scalar curvature is universal , i.e. , holds independent of the particular matter sources so long as they satisfy the mild energy condition ( [ strencon ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in all these cases , @xmath11 is spherically symmetric and the bianchi identity ensures ( [ bi ] ) .",
    "the restriction to maxwell fields as the only source has been used here only to show that @xmath268 vanishes on @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in the present setting of non - rotating isolated horizons , the zeroth law would hold for more general matter provided its stress energy tensor satisfies this last restriction .",
    "this condition is satisfied , for example , by dilatonic matter @xcite .    to 0pt4 .",
    "in the main definition , we assumed @xmath1 has topology @xmath269 .",
    "if @xmath112 is replaced by a compact 2-manifold of higher genus , the results of section [ s4 ] and the proof of constancy of @xmath11 on @xmath1 remain unaffected .",
    "however , in obtaining the explicit expression ( [ surfgrav ] ) of surface gravity , we used the gauss - bonnet theorem . hence this expression",
    "is not universal but depends on the genus of @xmath78 .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , to arrive at an appropriate generalization of the the first law of black hole mechanics , we first need to define the mass of an isolated horizon . the idea is to arrive at this definition through hamiltonian considerations . in section [ s6.1 ]",
    ", we introduce an action principle which yields the correct equations of motion despite the presence of the internal boundary @xmath1 . in section [ s6.2 ] ,",
    "we pass to the hamiltonian theory by performing a legendre transform and in [ s6.3 ] we discuss hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "we will find that , due to the form of the boundary conditions , there are subtle differences between the lagrangian and the hamiltonian frameworks because the latter allows more general variations than the former .",
    "as in previous sections , in the main discussion we assume the space - time under consideration is asymptotically flat with vanishing magnetic charge and discuss at the end the modifications required to incorporate non - zero @xmath76 and @xmath218 .",
    "recall from section [ s2 ] that , in absence of internal boundaries , the action for einstein ",
    "maxwell theory is given by : @xmath270 + \\frac{1}{8 \\pi } \\int_{\\mathcal{m}}{\\mbb{f}}\\wedge { { } ^\\star}{\\mbb{f}}+\\frac{i}{8 \\pi g } \\int_{c_\\infty } \\tr [ \\sigma \\wedge a]\\ ] ] in the presence of internal boundaries , however , this action need not be functionally differentiable . this is the case with our present boundary conditions at @xmath1 . in @xcite ,",
    "the required modifications were discussed for the case when all histories @xmath271 under consideration induce a fixed area @xmath139 and electro - magnetic charges @xmath217 ( and @xmath218 ) on @xmath1 and a differentiable action was obtained by adding to @xmath272 a surface term at @xmath1 .",
    "( for a general discussion of surface terms in the action , see @xcite . )",
    "the strategy of fixing the parameters of the isolated horizon was appropriate in @xcite because the aim of that analysis was to provide the classical framework for entropy calculations of horizons with _ specific _ values of their parameters . in this paper , on the other hand , we need a hamiltonian framework which is sufficiently general for the discussion of the first law , in which one must allow the parameters to change . therefore , we now need to allow histories with all possible values of parameters .",
    "note , however , that a key consequence of the boundary conditions is that the area @xmath139 and charge @xmath217 of the isolated horizon are constant in time .",
    "therefore , the values of these parameters are fixed in any one history ( although they may vary from one history to another ) .",
    "now , since all the fields are kept fixed on the initial and final surfaces in the variational principle and the values of our dynamical fields on either of these surfaces determine @xmath139 and @xmath273 for that history , one is only allowed to use those variations for which @xmath274 and @xmath275 vanish identically .",
    "this fact simplifies the task of finding an appropriate action considerably : for example , as far as the action principle is concerned , one can continue to use the action used in @xcite .",
    "there is however , a further subtlety which will lead us to use a more convenient boundary term in the action .",
    "because of the nature of the variational principle discussed above , we are free to add _ any _ function of the horizon parameters @xmath139 and @xmath217 without affecting the lagrangian equations of motion . in the framework considered in @xcite",
    ", this just corresponds to the freedom of adding a constant ( with appropriate physical dimension ) to the lagrangian .",
    "however , since the full class of histories now under consideration allows arbitrary areas @xmath139 and charges @xmath217 , the freedom is now more significant : it corresponds to changing the lagrangian by a _ function _ of parameters @xmath276 .",
    "while the variational procedure used to derive the lagrangian equations of motion is completely insensitive to this freedom , the hamiltonians resulting from these lagrangians will clearly be different .",
    "can all these hamiltonians yield consistent equations of motion ?",
    "the answer is in the negative .",
    "the reason lies in subtle differences between the lagrangian and hamiltonian variations . in the hamiltonian framework ,",
    "the phase - space is based on a fixed space - like 3-surface @xmath3 . since the values of @xmath139 and @xmath217 can vary from one history to another , they can also vary from one point of the phase space to another . in obtaining hamilton s equations , @xmath277 , we must now allow phase space tangent vectors @xmath278 which _ can _ change the values of parameters @xmath276 .",
    "consequently , with boundary conditions such as ours , the burden on the hamiltonian is greater than that on the lagrangian .",
    "it turns out that these additional demands on the hamiltonian suffice to eliminate the apparent functional freedom in its expression .",
    "more precisely , the requirement that hamilton s equations of motion be consistent for _ all _ variations @xmath278 in the phase space , including the ones for which @xmath274 and @xmath279 do not vanish , determine the hamiltonian completely .",
    "( there is no freedom to add a constant because , with only newton s constant @xmath280 and the speed of light @xmath281 at our disposal , there is no constant function on the phase space with dimensions of energy . )",
    "one can then work backwards and single out the expression of the action , which , upon legendre transform , yields the correct hamiltonian .",
    "we will follow this strategy .     of space - time considered in the variational principle",

    "the interior boundary @xmath1 is a non - rotating isolated horizon which satisfies the boundary conditions discussed in section 3 .",

    "note that this restriction is _ very _ mild since it only asks that the spherically symmetric part ( with respect to @xmath289 )  or , equivalently , the zero mode  of @xmath290 be real on @xmath1 . then",

    "that discussion will also show that the term added in the passage from ( [ action1 ] ) to ( [ action ] ) is uniquely determined by the consistency requirement .",
    "note that ( [ action ] ) does not have the chern - simons boundary term at @xmath1 used in @xcite .",

    "( the mild restriction ( [ restriction ] ) was not discussed in @xcite but is needed also in the action principle used there . ) in particular , as we will see in section [ s6.2 ] , the symplectic structure obtained from the present action ( [ action ] ) again has a boundary term at @xmath1 .",

    "we have chosen to work with ( [ action ] ) because it is more convenient for the hamiltonian framework with variable @xmath139 , needed in the discussion of the first law .",
    "furthermore , this form of the action appears to extend naturally to isolated horizons with distortion and rotation and also may be better suited for quantization in these more general contexts .      to pass to the hamiltonian framework",

    "the presence of the surface term in the symplectic structure is rather unusual .",
    "for instance , although there is a boundary term in the action at infinity , the symplectic structure does not acquire a corresponding boundary term . also note that we have not added new ` surface degrees of freedom ' at the horizon ( in contrast with , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "maxwell theory ( see section [ s2.2 ] ) and whose values on @xmath78 are determined by their values in the bulk by continuity . if anything , the boundary conditions _ restrict _ the degrees of freedom on @xmath1 by relating fields which are independent in the absence of boundaries .",
    "the symplectic structure on the space of these bulk fields simply acquires an extra surface term . in the classical theory , while this term is essential for consistency of the framework , it does not play a special role . in the description of the quantum geometry of the horizon and the entropy calculation @xcite ,",

    "hamilton s equations are @xmath320 where @xmath321 is the hamiltonian vector field associated with the given time evolution vector field @xmath46 and @xmath278 is an arbitrary variation of the fields . unlike in the discussion of the action , all fields appearing in the hamiltonian are defined only on the space - like surface @xmath3 .",
    "hamilton s equations describe the time evolution of these fields .",

    "thus , it only remains to examine the horizon terms . using the relation ( [ psi2 ] ) among @xmath199 , @xmath11 and @xmath239 , and equating the horizon terms on the two sides of hamilton s equations , we obtain : @xmath324 the first of these equations in particular guarantees that the horizon area does not change under time - evolution .",
    "the second equation follows from ( [ psi ] ) which defines @xmath310 and is thus a consistency condition .",
    "note also that the restriction ( [ restriction : psi ] ) on @xmath310 is preserved in time because of ( [ restriction ] ) .",
    "finally , it is natural to ask whether hamilton s equations imply @xmath325 .",
    "the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "however , this result is a consequence of a bulk equation of motion which guarantees @xmath326 where @xmath132 is any closed two surface .",
    "if we take @xmath327 , the obvious consequence is @xmath328 to summarize , there exists a unique consistent hamiltonian formulation in the presence of inner boundaries which are isolated horizons .",
    "the symplectic structure is given by ( [ sym ] ) , and the hamiltonian by ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the bulk equations of motion are the standard 3 + 1 versions of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations .",
    "there are , however , additional equations on the horizon 2-sphere @xmath78 which guarantee that @xmath239 is a constant of motion .    for simplicity , in the main discussion we restricted ourselves to zero magnetic charge and cosmological constant , only one asymptotic region and only one inner boundary .",
    "however , these restrictions can be easily removed .",
    "if there is more than one asymptotic region and/or isolated horizon inner boundary , one need only include surface terms for each of these boundary 2-spheres .",
    "the incorporation of a non - zero magnetic charge and cosmological constant has a slightly more significant effect . as in section [ s2.2 ] , the presence of a cosmological constant changes the boundary conditions and the surface terms at infinity .",
    "the symplectic structure is unchanged .",
    "but , as discussed in section [ s7.1 ] , the surface term at the horizon in the expression of the hamiltonian acquires additional terms involving @xmath218 and @xmath76 .",
    "in this section , we will examine the expression ( [ ham ] ) of the hamiltonian in some detail and extract physical information from it . in section [ s7.1 ] , we will argue that the surface term at @xmath287 should be identified with the mass of the isolated horizon . in section [ s7.2 ] , we will show that the numerical value of the hamiltonian in any static solution vanishes identically so that the mass of the isolated horizon in such a space - time reduces to the adm mass at infinity .",
    "finally , in section [ s7.3 ] , we will argue that , in any solution to the field equations which is asymptotically flat at null and spatial infinity and asymptotically schwarzschild at future time - like infinity , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) equals the total energy radiated away through future null infinity , @xmath2 . in these space - times",
    ", the mass of the isolated horizon then equals the future limit of the bondi mass , exactly as one would intuitively expect .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that the argument rests on assumptions on the asymptotic behavior of various fields ( particularly near @xmath13 ) and we do _ not _ prove the existence of solutions to field equations with this behavior .",
    "therefore , the discussion of section [ s7.3 ] has a different status from the rest of the paper .",
    "its primary purpose is to strengthen our intuition about the hamiltonian and the mass of the isolated horizon .      for any physical system ,",
    "energy can be identified with the numerical , on - shell value of the generator of the appropriate time translation . in minkowskian field theories , for example , it is the generator of motions on phase space which correspond to space - time diffeomorphisms along a constant time - like vector field .",
    "consider , as a second example , the theory of gravitational and electro - magnetic radiation in general relativity . in this case , one can construct a phase space of radiative modes at null infinity and the total radiated energy is the numerical value of the hamiltonian generating a time translation in the bms group at null infinity @xcite .",
    "finally , in the physics of fields which are asymptotically flat at spatial infinity , the adm energy arises as the on - shell , numerical value of the hamiltonian generating an asymptotic time - translation .",
    "if the space - time under consideration admits several asymptotic regions ( as , for example , in the kruskal picture ) then the energy in any one asymptotic region is given by the generator of a diffeomorphism which is an asymptotic time - translation in the region under consideration and asymptotically identity in all other regions .",
    "these considerations suggest we define the energy associated with a given isolated horizon @xmath1 to be the numerical , on - shell value of the generator of a diffeomorphism which is a time translation at @xmath1 and asymptotically identity . to obtain an expression for this energy ,",
    "let us examine the expression ( [ ham ] ) of the hamiltonian @xmath329 .",
    "the bulk term vanishes on shell and the term at infinity does not contribute if the vector field @xmath46 vanishes at spatial infinity .",
    "thus , the required expression is given simply by the surface term at @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , since the vector field @xmath46 tends to @xmath115 on @xmath1 and , by construction , @xmath115 defines the ` rest - frame ' of the isolated horizon , this energy can be identified with the mass @xmath12 of @xmath1 .",

    "one also knows directly ( i.e. , without making an appeal to black hole uniqueness theorems ) that the adm mass of _ any _ static black hole in the einstein  maxwell theory is given by ( [ mass ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus , as with our definition of surface gravity @xmath11 , although @xmath12 is defined using only the structure at the isolated horizon @xmath1 , it agrees with the standard definition of black hole mass for static solutions .",
    "the reason behind this agreement will become clear in the next sub - section .",
    "however , in general ( non - static ) space - times , due to the presence of radiation , the adm mass at infinity is quite distinct from the isolated horizon mass @xmath12 . when constraints are satisfied , we have @xmath333 and we will see in section [ s7.3 ] that the numerical value of @xmath334 can be identified with the total energy radiated through future null infinity . finally , note that @xmath335 has a specific contribution from the maxwell field .",
    "we will see that this contribution is rather subtle but quite crucial to adequately handle charged processes in the first law .",
    "as far as we are aware , none of the general , quasi - local expressions of mass contain this precise contribution from the maxwell field .",
    "thus , in the charged case , it appears that @xmath335 does not agree with any of the proposed quasi - local mass expressions .",
    "a natural question is whether @xmath335 is positive .",
    "let us first consider the case with zero cosmological constant .",
    "then , by fixing the value of the charge @xmath273 and minimizing @xmath335 with respect to @xmath239 , one finds @xmath335 is not only positive , but also bounded below : @xmath336 . at the minimum ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath337 , the surface gravity @xmath11 vanishes .",

    ". in this case , is natural to impose asymptotically anti - de sitter boundary conditions , whence one only expects ` black - hole type ' horizons .",
    "if @xmath76 is positive , one also has cosmological horizons and the situation becomes more involved .",
    "the resulting complications are illustrated by the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian framework is physically useful only in those situations in which @xmath3 is a partial cauchy surface for the space - time region @xmath15 under consideration .",
    "the isolated horizons in this case are future boundaries of space - time such as ( a ) and ( b ) in the figure .",
    "surface gravity as well as mass are positive on the black hole horizon ( a ) .",
    "the case of the cosmological horizon requires a reconsideration of the sign conventions we previously adopted ( see footnote 4 ) .",
    "specifically , in the construction of the hamiltonian framework of section [ s6.1 ] , we chose our orientations by assuming the projection of @xmath298 into @xmath3 is ` outward pointing ' at @xmath78 relative to @xmath3 . with this choice , the expansion of @xmath298 ( and hence the newman ",
    "penrose coefficient @xmath102 ) is negative on the black hole horizon ( a ) , but positive on the cosmological horizon ( b ) .",
    "since we assumed , again for definiteness , that @xmath102 is negative in sections [ s5 ] and [ s6 ] , certain trivial modifications are needed to accommodate cosmological future horizons of the type ( b ) . with these changes ,",
    "the surface gravity and mass are again positive on ( b ) .    to summarize ,",
    "it is future horizons of type ( a ) and ( b ) that are of physical interest in our hamiltonian framework . for them ,",
    "the surface gravity and mass are positive in schwarzschild  de sitter space - time and we expect the situation to be similar for general isolated horizons with positive cosmological constant .",
    "more detailed considerations suggest that the interpretation of @xmath139 as entropy and @xmath11 as temperature are applicable only to such horizons .",
    "the phase space now under consideration admits a 2-parameter family of static solutions , labeled by @xmath3 and @xmath339  the reissner  nordstrm solutions .",
    "let us begin by evaluating the hamiltonian @xmath329 ( of ( [ ham ] ) ) on these solutions using for @xmath46 the static killing field .",
    "then , the volume integrals will vanish since the constraints are satisfied and only contributions from @xmath340 and @xmath287 will remain .",
    "the term at infinity equals the negative of the adm mass while , as noted above , the horizon term is given by @xmath341 .",
    "now , it is well known from the smarr formula that on a reissner ",
    "nordstrm space - time , the value of the adm mass is precisely @xmath342 .",
    "therefore the value of the hamiltonian @xmath329 when evaluated on static space - times is zero .",
    "( the same reasoning extends to the case when @xmath76 and @xmath218 are non - zero . )",
    "this feature is not accidental ; there is a general argument from symplectic geometry which ` explains ' this vanishing of @xmath329 .",
    "we will conclude this sub - section by presenting the argument .    in symplectic geometry ,",
    "hamilton s equations are @xmath343 , where @xmath278 is an arbitrary variation and @xmath321 is the hamiltonian vector field .",
    "a stationary solution ( such as a reissner  nordstrm solution in the sector of einstein  maxwell theory now under consideration ) is one at which the hamiltonian vector field either vanishes or generates pure gauge evolution . in either case , the symplectic structure evaluated on @xmath321 and any other vector field @xmath278 vanishes .",
    "therefore , at these points of the phase space , @xmath344 for _ any _ variation @xmath278 . in particular @xmath345 for variations relating two nearby stationary solutions .",
    "let us suppose the phase space is such that the space of stationary solutions is connected ( an assumption satisfied by the reissner ",
    "nordstrm family in our case )",
    ". then , the hamiltonian must take some constant ` preferred value ' on all stationary solutions .",
    "now , let us suppose there is no natural energy scale in the theory .",
    "( this assumption is satisfied in our case because @xmath12 and @xmath217 are not fixed on our phase space and because one can not construct a quantity with dimensions of mass from @xmath280 and @xmath281 alone . )",
    "then , this ` preferred value ' must be zero .",
    "we now present a result which provides an intuitive interpretation of the hamiltonian @xmath329 and a further motivation for our definition of the isolated horizon mass @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , using suitable regularity assumptions , we will show that , when the equations of motion ( with @xmath346 ) are satisfied and @xmath46 is adapted to the natural rest frames at the horizon , the numerical value of @xmath329 equals @xmath347 , where @xmath348 is flux of energy radiated across @xmath2 .",

    "then , @xmath358 is a bms time - translation .",
    "diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath358 induce motions on the radiative phase - space .",
    "as one might expect , they preserve @xmath369 and the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xcite : @xmath370 where @xmath371 is the bondi news tensor at the point in the radiative phase space labeled by @xmath363 .",

    "thus , @xmath375 is the flux of energy across @xmath2 carried by gravitational and electro - magnetic waves .",
    "( again , the negative sign arises in ( [ bms ] ) because our signature is @xmath29 . ) the hamiltonian formulation at null infinity @xcite provides a general conceptual setting in support of this interpretation .",

    "consider tangent vectors satisfying linearized constraints at this point and evolve them using linearized field equations . in appendix c , assuming the background and linearized solutions satisfy certain falloff conditions , we find @xmath376 where @xmath369 is evaluated at the point in the radiative phase space defined by the background solution and @xmath377 is the tangent vector in the radiative phase space defined by the linearized solution @xmath278 .",
    "the idea is to let @xmath378 be arbitrary , choose for @xmath379 the hamiltonian vector field defined by a time translation , and use ( [ symeq ] ) to relate the canonical hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) to the radiative hamiltonian ( [ hamscri ] ) .",

    "then , from section [ s6 ] we have @xmath382 , with @xmath383 . from the above discussion of the radiative phase space",
    ", we have : @xmath384 where @xmath385 .",
    "therefore , using the equality ( [ symeq ] ) of the two symplectic structures , we conclude : @xmath386 for all linearized solutions @xmath278 satisfying the asymptotic conditions .",
    "let us assume such solutions span the tangent space at every point in the portion of the phase space under consideration .",
    "then , we conclude that @xmath329 and @xmath387 differ by a constant . to fix the value of that constant , let us examine the reissner ",
    "nordstrm space - times .",
    "we already saw in section [ s7.2 ] that in these space - times @xmath329 vanishes .",
    "since they are static , the bondi news tensor and the electro - magnetic radiation vanish on @xmath2 .",
    "hence , @xmath387 also vanishes in a reissner  nordstrm solution .",
    "thus , the value of the constant is zero and @xmath388 as one might have intuitively expected , the canonical hamiltonian equals the time component of the flux of the 4-momentum that is radiated across @xmath2 .",
    "recall from ( [ hamval ] ) that , when the constraints are satisfied , the value of the canonical hamiltonian @xmath329 is equal to the isolated horizon mass @xmath335 minus the adm energy @xmath389 in the rest frame of the isolated horizon .",
    "therefore , it now follows that @xmath390 .",
    "it is well - known that the difference of the adm energy and the flux of energy through @xmath2 , denoted @xmath391 , is the future limit of the bondi energy ( in the rest frame defined by @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude : @xmath392 thus , @xmath12 can be thought of as the mass remaining in the space - time after all radiation has escaped to infinity , or , equivalently , the mass of the black hole with its static hair .",
    "this simple interpretation provides additional support for our definition of the horizon mass .",
    "as emphasized earlier , the discussion of this subsection is based on a number of technical assumptions ( which are stated in appendix c.2 ) .",
    "we will conclude with a summary of their physical content .",
    "apart from asymptotic flatness at spatial and null infinity , the key assumptions involve the structure of @xmath13 .",
    "we assume there is only one bound state in asymptotic future , represented by the isolated horizon .",
    "this reflects the expectation that , in the einstein  maxwell theory , there would be no gravitational or electro - magnetic radiation hovering around the horizon at late times .",
    "multiple black hole solutions which reach equilibrium asymptotically are excluded , as their structure at @xmath13 would be quite different from that of the schwarzschild space - time . if the black holes do not reach asymptotic equilibrium but accelerate away from each other , the structure at @xmath13 may be similar to ( or even simpler than ) that in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "an example is provided by the c - metric , where , if the parameters are adjusted suitably , the structure at @xmath13 as well as that at @xmath151 is regular as in minkowski space - time . however , the accelerating black holes pierce @xmath2 which is now singular . therefore ,",
    "as it stands , our analysis is not applicable to this case either .",
    "although our analysis could conceivably be generalized to cover these two types of situation , its current form is primarily applicable to the situation depicted in figure 1(a ) in which a single gravitational collapse occurs .",
    "since we now have well - defined notions of surface gravity @xmath11 , electric potential @xmath247 and horizon mass @xmath12 , we are ready to examine the question of whether the first law holds . in section [ s8.1 ] , we will consider the _ equilibrium version _ of the law in which the horizon observables of two nearby space - times are compared .",
    "this version is closer in spirit to the treatment of the first law of thermodynamics in which one compares the values of macroscopic , thermodynamic quantities associated with two nearby equilibrium configurations , without reference to the process which causes the transition between them . in section [ s8.2 ]",
    ", we will consider the _",
    "physical process version _ of the first law in which one explicitly considers the process responsible for the transition .",
    "this version will bring out certain subtleties .",

    ", we will not have to refer at all to the boundary conditions at infinity or to the precise nature of the matter outside the isolated horizon .",
    "we will simply assume the surface gravity @xmath11 , the potential @xmath247 and the mass @xmath12 of the isolated horizon are determined by its intrinsic parameters @xmath239 and @xmath217 via ( [ surfgrav ] ) , ( [ fixmax ] ) and ( [ mass ] ) : @xmath394{2 }      m_\\delta & = \\frac{{\\ensuremath r_\\delta^{}}}{2 g } \\left(1 + \\frac{gq_\\delta^2}{{{\\ensuremath r_\\delta^{}}}^2 }      - \\lambda { { \\ensuremath r_\\delta^{}}}^2\\right )      & \\hspace{1 cm }   { \\ensuremath a_\\delta^{}}&= 4\\pi r_\\delta^2 \\\\",

    "( recall from section [ s3 ] that the notion of isolated horizons is not tied down to einstein  maxwell theory . )",
    "this viewpoint is similar to that normally adopted for the adm 4-momentum and angular momentum defined at spatial infinity .",
    "these quantities are first derived from hamiltonian considerations adapted to specific matter sources ( e.g. , klein gordon , maxwell , dirac and yang - mills fields ) but then used also for total 4-momentum and angular momentum for more general forms of matter ( e.g. fluids ) for which a satisfactory initial value formulation and hamiltonian framework may not exist .",
    "thus , one often uses the expressions of 4-momentum and angular momentum at infinity without specifying the precise matter content , assuming only that the stress - energy tensor satisfies physically reasonable conditions and falls off appropriately . in the same spirit",
    ", we now assume that @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath247 of an isolated horizon @xmath1 of radius @xmath239 and charge @xmath217 are given by ( [ mkappa ] ) , irrespective of the matter content outside , so long as that matter does not endow the horizon with additional intrinsic parameters ( such as a dilatonic charge or a new @xmath242 charge ) .    given a space - time @xmath351 in @xmath393 and a tangent vector @xmath278 at this point , we can consider a smooth curve in @xmath393 passing through this point with @xmath278 as a tangent vector there and examine how @xmath12 and @xmath11 associated with the isolated horizon @xmath1 in the background change .",
    "straightforward algebra yields : @xmath395 this equation tells us the relation between infinitesimal changes in the mass , area , and charge of two nearby , non - rotating isolated horizons . it is our generalization to isolated horizons of the _ equilibrium version _ of the first law of black hole mechanics .",
    "we will conclude this sub - section with a few remarks .    to 0pt1 .",
    "the above calculation leading to the first law is trivial .",
    "the non - trivial part of the analysis was to arrive at expressions ( [ mkappa ] ) of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in absence of a static killing field .",
    "again , although our boundary conditions allow the presence of radiation arbitrarily close to the horizon , they successfully extract the structure from event horizons of static black holes that is relevant for thermodynamic considerations . as with the zeroth law",
    ", the veracity of the first law can be taken as additional support for our definitions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    to 0pt2 .",
    "the laws of black hole mechanics were first derived by bardeen , carter and hawking @xcite .",
    "they considered stationary black holes possibly surrounded by a perfect fluid in a circular flow and arrived at the first law by comparing two nearby stationary solutions . for purposes of comparison , it is more convenient to use an extension of that work to more general matter fields discussed by heusler @xcite . in the non - rotating case , their main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "identities governing the komar integral of the static killing vector imply the mass @xmath396 measured at spatial infinity is given by @xmath397 where @xmath398 is the area of the horizon , @xmath3 is a partial cauchy surface from the horizon to spatial infinity , @xmath107 is the stress - energy of the matter field , and @xmath399 is the static killing field . under variations @xmath278 from one such stationary black hole solution to another , it was then shown that @xmath400 where @xmath401 is the 3-form dual to @xmath399 and @xmath402 , the 3-form dual to @xmath403 . in the einstein ",
    "maxwell case , it turns out that the two _ volume _ integrals in ( [ 1law ] ) collapse to a single term at the horizon which is precisely @xmath404 , where @xmath405 .",
    "thus , in this case , the first law relates the change in the adm mass to changes in quantities at the horizon .",
    "the final form is the same as ( [ firstlaw ] ) ( with @xmath12 replaced by @xmath396 ) .",
    "similarly the final expression of @xmath396 is just the right side of ( [ mass ] ) .    however , there are some important differences from our approach .",
    "first , in the above derivation , one restricts oneself to _",
    "static _ solutions of field equations and makes a heavy use of the komar integral associated with the killing vector @xmath399 .",
    "second , the permissible variations @xmath278 are only those which relate nearby static solutions .",
    "third , the term @xmath406 at the horizon arose from the volume terms in ( [ 1law ] ) ; that its value depends only on the fields evaluated at the horizon is not fundamental to this derivation .",
    "the whole calculation of @xcite is based on an interplay between infinity and the horizon which is possible only because the assumption of staticity makes the problem elliptic and field variations ` rigid ' . the black hole is not studied as an isolated , separate entity ; the quantities defined at the horizon are tightly tied to the exterior fields .",
    "indeed , there is no useful analog of the mass @xmath12 , associated with the horizon .",
    "perhaps the closest analog is the komar integral evaluated _ at _ the horizon , sometimes denoted @xmath407 @xcite .",
    "however , in the charged case , this integral does not include the maxwell contribution @xmath408 and can not therefore be used directly in the first law .",
    "our derivation , by contrast , makes no reference to a killing vector and allows radiation fields outside the horizon .",
    "all our considerations are local to the isolated horizon ; in the variation , we did not have to refer to bulk fields on @xmath3 at all .",
    "finally , the mass which appears in our first law is the isolated horizon mass , @xmath12 , and _ not _ the adm mass @xmath396 .    to 0pt3 .",
    "a treatment of the first law based on hamiltonian considerations was given by wald and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the final result of this work is more general than that of bardeen - carter - hawking type of analyses .",
    "the background space - time is again a stationary black hole , possibly with matter fields in the exterior .",
    "however , the perturbations @xmath278 are no longer required to be stationary ; they can relate the background stationary solution to any nearby solution .",
    "since our approach is also based on the hamiltonian framework , the two treatments share a number of common features .",
    "however , there are also a number of important differences , both in methodology and final results .",
    "while boundary conditions play a key role in our analysis , their analogs are not specified in references @xcite .",
    "consequently , the issue of differentiability of action is not discussed . in particular , while our action @xmath132 of ( [ action ] ) _ can not _ be written as a pure bulk term , in @xcite there is no surface term in the action either at infinity or at the horizon .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian contains only bulk terms and there is no analog of our horizon mass @xmath12 .",
    "when restricted to non - rotating black holes , the first law of @xcite has the same form as ( [ firstlaw ] ) .",
    "however , as in the bardeen - carter - hawking approach , our @xmath12 is replaced by the adm mass @xmath396 and the background space - time is assumed to be a stationary black hole solution .    to 0pt4 . as indicated in section [ s3.2 ] , the space @xmath393 of space - times admitting isolated horizons in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory is infinite - dimensional .",
    "the space @xmath409 of static solutions is a finite - dimensional subspace of @xmath393 . in the bardeen - carter - hawking type approach",
    ", the first law holds only at points of @xmath409 and for tangent vectors @xmath278 to @xmath409 . in the wald approach",
    ", it holds again only at points of @xmath409 but the variations @xmath278 need not be tangential to @xmath409 . in the approach developed in this paper , the first law holds at _ all _ points of @xmath393 and for _ all _ tangent vectors to @xmath393 .",
    "thus , the generalization involved is very significant .",
    "however , since our boundary conditions imply the intrinsic geometry of @xmath78 is spherically symmetric , distorted black holes are excluded from our analysis . by contrast , the other two approaches _ can _ handle static , distorted black hole solutions . in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory , there are no such solutions .",
    "however , if we allow charged fluid sources , such solutions presumably exist .",
    "therefore , in the general context , our framework misses out certain situations which are encompassed by the other two approaches .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize our framework to overcome this limitation .",
    "let us now consider the situation depicted in figure 1(b ) .",
    "we are given a space - time with a non - rotating , isolated horizon @xmath4 ( with parameters @xmath410 and @xmath411 ) .",
    "suppose a small amount of matter falls in to the horizon and after a brief dynamical period the horizon settles down to a new equilibrium configuration @xmath5 ( with parameters @xmath412 and @xmath413 ) .",
    "the question is : how do the observables associated with the horizons change in this physical process ?",
    "the difference from the situation considered in the previous subsection is that one is now considering a physical process occurring in a single space - time rather than comparing two nearby space - times .",
    "it is completely straightforward to analyze the process in our framework since the two masses and surface gravities are determined by their intrinsic parameters via ( [ mkappa ] ) .",
    "the actual algebraic calculation is the same as in the last sub - section ; only the physical meaning of the variation @xmath278 is different .",
    "hence , we again find the changes in mass , area and charge are governed by ( [ firstlaw ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to analyze this relation in terms of properties of the matter which fell across the horizon . using the raychaudhuri equation , and keeping only first order terms in variations , it is straightforward to show @xcite @xmath414 where @xmath415 is the portion of the horizon ( between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) crossed by the matter and @xmath416 is the 3-form dual to @xmath417 .",
    "let us first suppose @xmath418 , i.e. , the charge of the horizon did not change in this physical process . then , comparing ( [ flux ] ) with ( [ firstlaw ] ) , we arrive at a simple physical picture : the change in the mass of the horizon is equal to the total energy flux @xmath419 across the horizon .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , if @xmath420 , there is an extra contribution , @xmath406 , to @xmath421 .",
    "what is the origin of this term ?",
    "it arises due to ` book - keeping ' in the following sense .",
    "as we observed in section [ s7 ] , @xmath12 contains not just the ` raw energy of the content of the horizon ' , but also the energy of the electro - magnetic hair outside the horizon .",
    "( recall that in static solutions , @xmath12 equals the adm mass and , more generally , it equals the future limit of the bondi mass , both of which include the contribution from energy in the coulombic electro - magnetic field outside the horizon . ) before the physical process began , the charge @xmath422 is outside the horizon and the energy in its coulomb field does not contribute to @xmath282 . at the end of the process , however , the black hole charge changes by @xmath279 and the energy in the corresponding coulombic field does contribute to @xmath283 .",
    "this accounts for the term @xmath423 in the expression of @xmath424 .",
    "thus , the physical process version of the first law is subtle .",
    "the first order change in the mass of the horizon has a two - fold origin : a contribution due to flux of energy across horizon and another contribution from book - keeping of the energy in the coulombic hair of the horizon .",
    "what is the situation in the standard framework , where one uses @xmath396 in place of @xmath12 ?",
    "to our knowledge , the physical process version of the first law has been discussed only in the uncharged case @xcite .",
    "one assumes that the background space - time is globally static and considers a ( non - static ) matter perturbation which falls across the horizon .",
    "the adm mass of the unperturbed space - time is taken to be @xmath282 and the adm mass of the background plus perturbation is taken to be @xmath283 . then , using the reasoning given above , one arrives at the first law @xmath425 and interprets @xmath7 as the change in the mass of the black hole due to the energy flux across the horizon .",
    "however , in the charged case , if @xmath279 is not equal to zero , it seems difficult to account for the term @xmath406 which also contributes to @xmath7 without bringing in @xmath12 .",
    "that comes from the first order change in the stress energy of the maxwell field .",
    "however , a closer examination shows that the integral of the maxwell contribution vanishes identically .",
    "] it is interesting to note that , in this respect , there is a key difference between the angular momentum work term @xmath426 and the electro - magnetic term @xmath427 : while the angular momentum contribution is coded easily in the flux of the stress - energy across the horizon , the electro - magnetic contribution is not .",
    "this is why , unlike the electro - magnetic work term , the angular momentum work term can be easily incorporated in the physical process version in the standard approach @xcite .",
    "let us begin with a summary of the main ideas and results .    in section [ s3 ]",
    "we introduced the notion of a non - rotating isolated horizon @xmath1 .",
    "while one needs access to the entire space - time to locate an event horizon , isolated horizons can be located quasi - locally .",
    "event horizons of static black holes in einstein  maxwell theory do qualify as isolated horizons .",
    "however , the definition does not require the presence of a killing field even in a neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "rather , physically motivated , geometric conditions are imposed on the null normal @xmath115 to @xmath1 and on an associated inward pointing null vector @xmath116 _ at _ @xmath1 .",
    "these conditions imply the lie derivative along @xmath115 of the intrinsic ( degenerate ) metric of @xmath1 vanishes which in turn implies the area of an isolated horizon is constant in time . in this sense ,",
    "the horizon itself is isolated or ` in equilibrium ' . however , the space - time may well admit electro - magnetic and/or gravitational radiation .",
    "the quasi - local nature of the definition of @xmath1 and the possibility of the presence of radiation suggest the space of solutions to the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations admitting isolated horizons would be _",
    "infinite_-dimensional , in striking contrast to the space of _ static _ black holes which is only three - dimensional .",
    "recent mathematical results by a number of workers @xcite show this expectation is indeed correct .",
    "while the conditions used in the definition seem mild , they lead to a surprisingly rich structure . in particular , the intrinsic metric of @xmath1 , the shear , twist and expansion of @xmath115 and @xmath116 and several of the newman - penrose gravitational and electro - magnetic curvature scalars _ at _ @xmath1 have the same functional dependence on the radius @xmath239 and charges @xmath244 as in the reissner  nordstrm solutions .",
    "this rich structure enables one to fix naturally the scaling of the null normal @xmath115 and leads to an unambiguous definition of surface gravity , @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , using only the structure available at @xmath1 , one can show that @xmath11 is constant on @xmath1 ; the zeroth law is thus extended from static black holes to isolated horizons .    to formulate the first law ,",
    "we need a notion of the mass @xmath12 of the isolated horizon .",
    "since we allow for the presence of radiation outside @xmath1 , we can not use the adm mass @xmath396 as @xmath12 , nor do we have a static killing field to perform a komar integral at @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately , we can use the hamiltonian framework .",
    "although the presence of the internal boundary introduces several subtleties , a satisfactory hamiltonian framework _ can be _ constructed .",
    "when the constraints are satisfied , the hamiltonian turns out to be a sum of two surface terms , one at infinity and one at @xmath1 . as usual , the term at infinity yields the adm energy and we define @xmath12 to be the surface term at @xmath1 .",
    "this definition is supported by several independent considerations . in particular , under suitable conditions",
    ", @xmath12 turns out to be the future limit of the bondi mass . having expressions for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 at our disposal , we ask if the first law holds .",
    "the answer is in the affirmative for both the ` equilibrium state ' and the ` physical process ' versions .",
    "this provide a significant generalization of the first law of mechanics of static black holes in the einstein  maxwell theory .",
    "furthermore , in the charged case , this analysis brings out some subtleties associated with the ` physical process ' version .",
    "however , since our framework focusses on isolated horizons and small perturbations thereof , it does not shed new light on the second law of black hole mechanics which refers to fully dynamical situations .",
    "these underlying ideas overlap with those introduced in references @xcite . in @xcite , hayward introduced , and very effectively used , the notion of ` trapping horizons ' .",
    "our isolated horizons are a special case of trapping horizons , the most important restriction being our assumption that the expansion of the horizon is zero .",
    "this assumption is essential to capture the notion that the horizon is in equilibrium , which underlies the zeroth and the first law .",
    "furthermore , our method of defining the surface gravity @xmath11 and the mass @xmath12 of isolated horizons differ from those used by hayward for trapping horizons and consequently our treatment of the two laws is also different .",
    "( to our knowledge , in the context of trapping horizons , a satisfactory definition of surface gravity is available only for spherically symmetric space - times . ) however , the notion of isolated horizon is clearly inadequate for the treatment of dynamical situations which are considered , for example , in the second law and it is these situations that provide a primary motivation in the analysis of trapping horizons .",
    "the relation between the ideas discussed in this paper and those introduced in @xcite is closer .",
    "both papers deal with isolated horizons .",
    "however , while the focus of reference @xcite is on constructing a hamiltonian framework suitable for quantization and entropy calculations , the focus of the present paper is on the mechanics of isolated horizons .",
    "the two overlap in their constructions of hamiltonian frameworks .",
    "however , as explained in section [ s6 ] , reference @xcite only considers isolated horizons with _ fixed",
    "_ parameters @xmath428 and therefore ignores several subtleties which are critical to our present treatment of the first law .",
    "reciprocally , in @xcite , significant effort went into the construction of a hamiltonian framework in terms of _ real _ variables which is necessary for quantization but not for the laws of mechanics .",
    "finally , in sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] and in appendices a and b , we took the opportunity to present the necessary background material from a perspective which is different from but complementary to that adopted in @xcite .",
    "we will conclude by indicating a few avenues to extend the present work .",
    "let us begin with the non - rotating case .",
    "although we did not explicitly require the intrinsic metric of an isolated horizon to be spherically symmetric , our assumptions on properties of the null vector fields @xmath115 and @xmath116 _ at _ the horizon led us to this conclusion .",
    "the discussion of section [ s2.2 ] shows the assumptions are not overly restrictive : the class of space - times satisfying them is infinite - dimensional .",
    "typically , these space - times will admit radiation and will _ not _ be spherically symmetric in the bulk .",
    "nonetheless , it is of interest to weaken our assumptions to allow space - times with ` distorted ' horizons on which the intrinsic geometry will not be spherical . for simplicity , consider the case in which there is no matter in a small neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "then , we would expect only to have to weaken the conditions on @xmath116 and allow @xmath102 to be non - spherical .",
    "the structure at event horizons of static , distorted black - holes has been recently examined by fairhurst and krishnan and their analysis confirms this hypothesis .",
    "the extension of the framework presented here to incorporate distortion should be fairly straight forward .    to 0pt2 .",
    "inclusion of rotation would provide an even more interesting extension .",
    "again , conditions on @xmath115 would remain unchanged .",
    "only the conditions on @xmath116 and the sphericity requirement on the component @xmath429 of stress - energy tensor at @xmath1 will have to be weakened .",
    "in particular the newman - penrose spin - coefficient @xmath125 can no longer be zero since it is a potential for the imaginary part of @xmath430 which carries the angular momentum information .",
    "work is already in progress on this generalization .    to 0pt3 .",
    "in the stationary context , using hamiltonian methods and noether charges , wald @xcite has extended the notion of entropy and discussed the first law in a wide variety of gravitational theories , possibly coupled to bosonic fields , in any space - time dimension .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend the present framework for isolated horizons in a similar fashion .",
    "as a first step , one would recast the framework in terms of tetrads @xmath431 and the associated real , lorentz connections @xmath432 .",
    "the extension of the resulting ( einstein - matter ) action and hamiltonian framework to higher dimensions should then be straight - forward .",
    "the first step is easy to carry out since the tetrads can be easily obtained from soldering forms and the lorentz connection is just the real part of our self - dual connection .",
    "thus , the 4-dimensional tetrad action is , in effect , just the real part of ( [ action ] ) and the corresponding hamiltonian is just the real part of ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "hence , it should be rather easy to extend the present results to higher - dimensional general relativity , possibly coupled to matter .",
    "furthermore , since the basic variables are tetrads rather than metrics , it should be straightforward to allow fermionic matter as well .",
    "incorporating general gravitational theories , on the other hand , could be highly non - trivial .",

    "the expression of the 3-form @xmath485 involves 4-dimensional fields .",
    "however , when we integrate it over @xmath3 to obtain the symplectic structure , only the pull - backs to @xmath3 of these fields contribute .",
    "the main idea behind our calculation can be summarized as follows .",
    "when equations of motion are satisfied , the 3-form @xmath485 is curl - free .",
    "therefore , the integral of @xmath505 trivially vanishes in the 4-dimensional region @xmath15 bounded by the isolated horizon @xmath1 , a partial cauchy surface @xmath3 and null infinity @xmath2 .",
    "hence , provided all fields remain regular ( in a conformal completion in which @xmath13 is a single point ) , the integral of @xmath485 on @xmath3 equals the sum of the integrals over @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us first consider the integral over @xmath1 . using the isolated horizon boundary conditions one can show the sum of the first and last terms",
    "can be expressed as an exact differential which is precisely the negative of the one appearing in the second term of @xmath485 .",
    "thus , the integral of the symplectic current over @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "hence , the integral of the symplectic current over @xmath3 equals that over @xmath2 .",
    "the former is just the canonical symplectic structure ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "the idea now is to show that the latter is the radiative symplectic structure at @xmath2 .",
    "let us therefore evaluate @xmath506 .",
    "it is immediate from the falloff condition @xmath507 that the exact part ( i.e. , the second term in the expression ) of @xmath485 does not contribute at @xmath2 .",
    "next , using the conformal invariance of maxwell s equations , it is fairly straightforward to evaluate the electro - magnetic part ( i.e. the third term ) of this integral . since @xmath508 satisfies maxwell s equations on @xmath350 , the maxwell potentials @xmath41 are well - behaved at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we impose the gauge condition ( [ emacond ] ) at @xmath2 and evaluate the electro - magnetic contribution to the integral of @xmath485 over @xmath2 .",
    "it equals precisely the electro - magnetic part of the symplectic structure ( [ symscri ] ) at @xmath2 .      the gravitational symplectic structure ( [ sym ] )",
    "is expressed in terms of the fields @xmath22 and @xmath25 . to compare it with the symplectic structure at @xmath2 , we first need to re - express it in terms of the metric @xmath354 and its variations .",
    "since we are assuming the equations of motion , and in particular gauss law @xmath509 , the connection @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the soldering form @xmath36 as @xmath510 an arbitrary variation to the soldering form @xmath36 can be written as @xmath511 where @xmath512 is symmetric and @xmath513 is antisymmetric .",
    "it is easy to check that the above variation in @xmath36 induces a variation @xmath514 in the metric .",
    "also , by performing an internal gauge transformation on @xmath515 _ without _ changing the background field @xmath36 , @xmath513 can be set equal to zero .",
    "this gauge transformation leaves the variation of the metric @xmath512 unchanged .",
    "hence , from now on , without loss of generality , we assume we are in a gauge in which @xmath513 has been set to zero .",
    "this choice of internal gauge will simplify our calculations considerably but is _ not _ essential since the symplectic structure is gauge invariant .",
    "we can now express @xmath515 in terms of the conformally rescaled soldering form @xmath516 as @xmath517 now , one would naively expect @xmath518 to be finite at @xmath2 .",
    "however , in the context of vacuum general relativity , geroch and xanthopoulos @xcite have shown that perturbations with @xmath519 initial data of compact support have a better behavior : in a suitable gauge , @xmath518 in fact vanishes at @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath520 is well defined and @xmath519 at @xmath2 and satisfies the following conditions : @xmath521 at @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the trace - free part of the field @xmath522 at @xmath2 is precisely the field @xmath523 representing the change in the equivalence class of connections at @xmath2 , i.e. the tangent vector to the phase space of radiative modes induced by @xmath512 @xcite @xmath524 we will _ assume _ the tangent vectors @xmath278 under consideration have this asymptotic behavior .    with this structure at hand , a straightforward but lengthy calculation enables one to express the variations of @xmath25 and @xmath22 in terms of fields which are smooth at @xmath2 : @xmath525 \\\\",

    "assuming that at least one of the two perturbations , @xmath527 and @xmath528 vanishes at @xmath151 and @xmath13 , we can therefore write the gravitational part of the canonical symplectic structure as @xmath529 where the volume form @xmath530 on @xmath2 is given by ( [ volscri ] ) .    to bring this expression to the same form",
    "as appears in ( [ symscri ] ) it is necessary to replace the fields @xmath522 with their trace - free parts @xmath523 in the first integral .",
    "this will not introduce any additional terms because of the properties ( [ gx2 ] ) of @xmath522 .",
    "also , since @xmath2 is divergence - free , we can replace @xmath531 with @xmath532 .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that , when the equations of motion hold , both the gravitational and electro - magnetic parts of the symplectic structure can be rewritten in terms of fields living at @xmath2 .",
    "combining these results , it follows that @xmath533 provided the background and the tangent vectors have certain asymptotic properties .    to conclude ,",
    "let us collect the assumptions on the behavior of various fields that were necessary to arrive at ( [ symeq ] ) .",
    "the background solution is assumed to be asymptotically flat at spatial and future null infinity and asymptotically schwarzschild at future time - like infinity . in a conformal frame",
    "in which @xmath2 is divergence - free , the linearized fields @xmath522 are assumed to satisfy the geroch - xanthopoulos conditions ( [ gx ] ) , ( [ gx2 ] ) and the maxwell potential @xmath534 is assumed to satisfy ( [ emacond ] ) at @xmath2 .",
    "next , at least one of @xmath527 and @xmath528 has to vanish at @xmath13 and at least one of them has to vanish at @xmath151 .",
    "this last assumption can easily be met in the actual application of ( [ symeq ] ) in the main text ( section [ s7.3 ] ) .",
    "there , @xmath379 is the hamiltonian vector field associated with a bms time translation @xmath358 ; @xmath535 . now , up to numerical factors , the total energy radiated across @xmath2 in the ( background ) space - time is given by the integral of squares of these two fields .",
    "hence , it is physically reasonable to restrict oneself to space - times in which the two fields go to zero as one approaches @xmath13 and @xmath151 along @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", @xmath528 will automatically satisfy the last requirement .",
    "finally , for the main result ( [ heqerad ] ) of section [ s7.3 ] to hold , an additional condition must be satisfied : the linearized fields @xmath522 and @xmath536 satisfying ( [ gx ] ) , ( [ gx2 ] ) and ( [ emacond ] ) should span the tangent space at each point of the sector of phase space considered .    while these assumptions seem plausible , we do not know of general results which will ensure that a ` sufficient number ' of such background solutions exist or that they will admit a ` sufficient number ' of linearized fields satisfying our conditions . indeed , at this stage , one does not even have a conclusive proof of existence of a ` sufficient number ' of radiating solutions which have smooth and complete @xmath2 .",
