    "one of the main mysteries of the quasar phenomenon is the associated powerful outflows that come in a variety of forms .",
    "these outflows can be manifest as extremely energetic relativistic jets @xmath3  kpc in extent or massive broad absorption line ( bal ) winds .",
    "furthermore , the existence of large scale jets and bal winds are almost mutually exclusive .",
    "the propensity for suppressed large scale emission increases strongly with balnicity index @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that this definition specifically excludes the so - called  mini - balqsos , \" with the balnicity index = 0 @xcite .",
    "this is desirable since the dr5 statistical analysis of @xcite indicate that these types of sources ( mini - balqsos have a large overlap in definition with the intermediate width absorption line sources of @xcite ) tend to resemble non - balqsos more than balqsos in many spectral properties .",
    "mini - balqsos also tend to have much smaller x - ray absorbing columns than balqsos @xcite . typically , ",
    "balqso \" radio targets are actually mini - balqsos since they have larger radio fluxes than bona - fide balqsos , e.g. @xcite . ] . from very long baseline array ( vlba )",
    "studies of the bal quasar ( balqso ) mrk231 in @xcite and other radio quiet quasar studies , it has become evident that radio quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can have relativistic outflows with significant kinetic luminosity , but possibly only for short periods of time @xcite .",
    "so this raises the question what is it that makes some sources radio quiet and others radio loud ? does the bal wind inhibit the efficacy of jet initiation or does it simply limit the ability of a jet to propagate to large distances , or both ? at a redshift of @xmath4 ,",
    "mrk231 is one of the nearest radio quiet quasars to earth .",
    "the radio core is perhaps the brightest of any radio quiet quasar ( and certainly the brightest balqso core ) at high frequency ( 22 and 43  ghz ) . studying",
    "the radio core at high frequency can provide vital clues to the origin of both the large scale radio jets and the bal winds in agn .",
    "thusly motivated , the authors have embarked on a program of high frequency vlba observations @xcite and long term high frequency , densely time sampled , low resolution radio monitoring .",
    "we report our first four years of radio monitoring results here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 will describe previous evidence of the blazar - like nature of mrk231 .",
    "this is the motivation for expected dramatic behavior in the high frequency light curve .",
    "the next section describes the observational details of our monitoring . in section  4",
    ", we compare our most recent epoch of monitoring to typical strong blazar flares . throughout this paper , we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath5=71 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the most striking finding in our summary of the vlba observation in @xcite was the strong 22  ghz flare that emerged from the core between epochs 2006.07 and 2006.32 ( @xmath9 increase in less than 3 months ) .",
    "all attempts in @xcite to model the high frequency peak of the spectral turnover , 19.5  ghz , in combination with the steep spectral index throughout . ] above 22  ghz ( @xmath10 ) indicate that the flare is synchrotron self - absorbed and the brightness temperature is @xmath11 , unless the flux density is doppler boosted .",
    "the doppler boosted models indicated an intrinsic ( rest frame of the plasma ) brightness temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the modeling of the flare in @xcite also requires that the bulk of the flare emission is from a region on the order of @xmath13  cm .",
    "there is strong corroboration in the literature of this blazar - like behavior .",
    "a @xmath14  mjy flux density variation in 1  day at 22.2  ghz was reported in @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] . using the methods of @xcite ,",
    "the time variability brightness temperature was found in @xcite to be @xmath15  k. if the brightness temperature ( @xmath16 ) exceeds @xmath17  k , it requires a nearly pole - on orientation and relativistic motion for the jet in order to avoid the  inverse compton catastrophe \" @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the line of sight to the jet is restricted kinematically to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the program utilized long term monitoring with the vla ( very large array ) and evla ( expanded very large array ) at 22  ghz and ami ( arcminute microkelvin imager ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 13.5  18  ghz .",
    "these data are plotted in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] along with historical data both from the literature @xcite and from the vla public archive ( project codes ab783 , an030 , au015 ) .",
    "both our monitoring data and the data from the vla archive were calibrated using nrao s aips package via the parseltongue interface @xcite in the standard way .",
    "3c286 served as the primary flux calibrator in all the vla observations . in our vla / evla monitoring observations ( 2009  2012 ) we also made use of j1219 + 4829 as a nearby secondary flux calibrator .",
    "flux density error estimates on mrk231 were confirmed by short scans on another vla calibrator ( j1400 + 6210 ) located at a similar separation from the secondary calibrator as mrk231 and calibrated in an identical fashion to mrk231 . both ami s large array and small array",
    "were used , but the small array data are preferred , as explained below .",
    "the ami data were calibrated using the standard ami pipeline .",
    "mrk231 appears to have no significant 20  ghz emission on scales larger than an arcsecond ( it appears as a point source to the vla in all configurations ) , so the wide range in spatial resolution provided by the various instruments in the historical observations of this source has little effect on the measured flux densities .",
    "the exceptions are the vlbi measurements which resolve out some of the larger scale , presumably diffuse , emission . in order to convert the vlba data in @xcite to that which would have been detected with an array containing shorter baselines ( such as the vla ) , we separate out the steady background components . in 1996.93",
    "the vla measured @xmath19  mjy at 22  ghz and the nuclear double was observed simultaneously with the vlba to be @xmath20  mjy @xcite .",
    "we designate this as @xmath21 mjy , which must be added to the vlba measurement flux density to get the total flux density at 22  ghz ( i.e. , the 2006 data points in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the scientific interest here is to detect the flaring core on the background of the quasi steady component .",
    "three separate vlba observations resolve the nuclear double at 22 ghz @xcite .",
    "the secondary flux density , @xmath22 , is fairly steady ranging from 36 to 43  mjy .",
    "thus , to find the core flux density from the total flux density at any epoch @xmath23    the first two monitoring efforts were with the vla at 22  ghz in the final quarters of 2009 and 2010 ( project codes ar699 and ar717 ) . in 2009 ,",
    "the flux density was steady and slightly elevated relative to the long term average . in 2010 ,",
    "the flux density was steady again and slightly suppressed relative to the long term average .",
    "the third monitoring campaign utilized the evla at 22  ghz ( vla11b-019 ) and was executed between october 2011 and january 2012 .",
    "we detected the decay of what must have been a very strong flare earlier in 2011 . in the last quarter of 2012",
    ", we switched to ami for monitoring which is continuing .",
    "the advantage of ami is that it can provide more frequent monitoring with a lower calibration overhead than the evla .",
    "the disadvantage is that the maximum available frequency is only 18  ghz , ( total useful frequency range 13.5  18  ghz ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ami ] shows the 15.3  ghz light curve from the 8  months of monitoring with ami .",
    "the observations began with the ami large array .",
    "however , we noticed flux density variations that exceeded the formal error estimates from the ami pipeline but seemed unlikely to be due to source variability .",
    "in order to test this hypothesis we began taking simultaneous measurements with the small array .",
    "the small array data appeared much more consistent .",
    "we conjecture that the large array variations were associated with a high sensitivity to weather conditions which could not be properly calibrated . after realizing this",
    ", we switched to only small array monitoring .",
    "considering the magnitude of the flare , the accuracy of the large array data is adequate as a whole for finding the start of the flare , although any measurement taken individually would be suspect .",
    "this is verified by taking the linear fit to the small array data near the overlap region and extending it to earlier times in the bottom frame of figure  [ fig : ami ] .",
    "the flare start is approximately mjd 56185  56190 .",
    "we only show the ami data at one frequency in figure  [ fig : ami ] for the sake of clarity since the spectrum is flat and the data points overlap .",
    "typically the spectral index is about @xmath24 .",
    "however , the data are formally consistent with @xmath25 .",
    "the flare in figure  [ fig : ami ] seems to have a magnitude and decay time similar to that indicated by the declining flux density seen in our evla observations in the last quarter of 2011 ( see figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of this flare is larger than the highest previously measured flux density , @xmath26  mjy in 1976 at 22.2 ghz @xcite .",
    "on mjd  56363 , the 17.6  ghz flux density was @xmath27  mjy with a spectral index @xmath28 , the corresponding spectral energy , was @xmath29 .",
    "given the blazar - like properties of mrk231 noted in section  2 , we compare the strong flare in the 17.6  ghz light curve from ami to archival 22  ghz blazar flare light curves in this section .",
    "large blazar flares are typically associated with the ejection of components from the nucleus that can be detected on parsec scales with vlbi .",
    "famous examples include 3c273 and bl  lacertae @xcite .",
    "however , counter - examples exist when the core brightens , yet no ejected component is resolved with vlbi @xcite .",
    "we pick the frequency of 22  ghz since it is high enough that the total flux density will be dominated by the flat spectrum radio core . furthermore",
    ", a large data set at 22  ghz of blazar light curves can be found in @xcite .",
    "we define a flare as _ an abrupt change in a light curve that results in a dramatic increase above the quiescent background that precedes the flare . _ there are two quantitative components to describe this behavior : the abrupt change that is expressed in terms of the time rate of increase of the light curve , @xmath30 , and the large local maximum of the light curve , @xmath31",
    ". these parametric descriptions are best expressed in units that are normalized to the quiescent flux density level , @xmath32 , that precedes the flare , i.e. , the normalized amplitude @xmath33 and @xmath34/(flare rise time ) .",
    "the reason for the normalization is the following .",
    "consider a source with a quiescent flux density of @xmath35 mjy .",
    "a @xmath36 mjy increase in flux density is a very significant relative change , @xmath37 .",
    "by contrast if the quiescent flux density is @xmath38 jy , @xmath39 mjy increase in flux density is imperceptible , @xmath40 .",
    "a second critical aspect of defining a peak in the flux density is that the local maximum be statistically significant above the noise level of the quiescent background .",
    "this is important since high frequency survey observations can have significant uncertainty if the flux density is modest @xcite .",
    "the standard that we adopt for defining a local maximum corresponding to a flare peak in the light curve is that the putative peak is @xmath41 above the quiescent baseline level , where @xmath42 combines the uncertainty in the baseline and peak measurements in quadrature , @xmath43 .",
    "a key element for defining the flare is the determination of quiescent flux density that precedes the putative flare .",
    "this can be difficult in general due to source flickering that is on the same order of magnitude as the statistical uncertainty in each measurement and occasionally a second flare occurs during the rise of a previously initiated flare .",
    "generally , in the latter circumstance , these flares are not considered in our statistical analysis since there is so much uncertainty created by this circumstance .",
    "the only exception is if the second flare is clearly much weaker than the first flare ( i.e. , it is essentially large flicker noise ) .",
    "our working definition of the baseline is a minimum of 4 consecutive observations which agree within the 1@xmath44 uncertainty and do not show a trend of increasing in time .",
    "this data is linearly fit to determine the local ( in time ) baseline quiescent level .",
    "we compare the flare in mrk231 to those of the flares discovered by long term monitoring of @xmath45 200 flat spectrum radio sources at 22 ghz @xcite .",
    "we compare the flares in the 22 ghz light curves to the flares in mrk 231 . due to the condition defining a statically significant flare , @xmath46 ,",
    "all flares satisfy @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we effectively segregate traditional blazars from other less violently variable flat spectrum agn ( non - blazars are rare in this high frequency selected sample ) .",
    "the other implication of the @xmath46 condition is that for noisy light curves , many flares can not be discerned cleanly from the noise using this standard and are excluded from our analysis .",
    "a second complicating feature are gaps in the temporal coverage that do not allow one of the following three quantities to be determined , @xmath32 , @xmath31 or the start of the flare .",
    "other flares are excluded from our analysis due to a poor determination of @xmath32 that arises not only from gaps in sampling , but noise superimposed on low flux density levels or uncertainty due to two or more compound flares . in the end , we found 106 suitable flares in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath30 and @xmath33 is plotted in figure 3 . in order to compare @xmath30 of objects at different redshifts ,",
    "the data were converted into the elapsed time as measured in the qso rest frame .",
    "the comparison of @xmath30 and @xmath33 from the blazar sample and the mrk231 flare shows that the 2013 flare is in - family ( rise time and relative magnitude ) with blazar flares . if we consider the background contributions from equation  1 , @xmath48 tripled in 2013 , from @xmath49  mjy to @xmath50  mjy in @xmath51 150 days .",
    "based on two observations with vlba , we can get crude estimates of the parameters for the 2006 flare in figure 1 , @xmath52 , @xmath53/month , also in - family with the blazar flares in figure 3 .",
    "in this letter , we demonstrated that strong , blazar - like , flares were detected in the radio quiet quasar , mrk231 .",
    "furthermore , this is occurring in a balqso in which the radio jets are typically suppressed .",
    "ostensibly , mrk231 is on the verge of becoming radio loud , but the relativistic energy stream from the central engine is being stifled by the bal wind .",
    "another example of a strong radio flare in a radio quiet quasar is iii zw 2 .",
    "the magnitude of the flare in 1999 in this object is much more extreme .",
    "the 22 ghz flux increases by a factor of @xmath5115 in 1.8 years @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is off the chart in the top frame of figure 3 and @xmath54/month is also larger than the 2013 flare for mrk231 .",
    "such extreme behavior occurs preferentially in radio quiet quasars since @xmath32 is generally small and the occasional large flare will be amplified by this normalization .",
    "for example , the 1976 flare at 22.2 ghz in mrk231 discussed in @xcite , is very abrupt .",
    "it increased by @xmath55 mjy in 0.033 months , which leads to a relatively large @xmath56 and an extremely large value of @xmath57/month , which is off the chart in the bottom frame of figure 3 . in spite of such dramatic behavior in these radio quiet quasars",
    "there is one benign property of these flares that indicates the radio quietness .",
    "the increase in the intrinsic radio flux density of the flare ( in the qso rest frame ) is very low compared to the much higher redshift blazars in @xcite .",
    "thus , the variability brightness temperatures for the 2013 mrk 231 and the 1999 iii zw 2 flares are modest , @xmath58 k and @xmath59 k , respectively , per the methods of @xcite , @xmath60 orders of magnitude less than strong blazar flares .    in conclusion ,",
    "blazar - like flares are not rare in mrk231 , we detect one in various stages of evolution half the time that we observe the source",
    ". further comparison to blazar flares can be made if superluminal ejections are detected with vlbi observations that are triggered by a flare detected with ami monitoring .",
    "we currently have approved vlba observations to pursue this .",
