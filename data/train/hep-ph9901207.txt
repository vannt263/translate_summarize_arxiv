    "explosive particle production at the end of the period of inflation is a crucial element of inflationary cosmology .",
    "it determines the effectiveness of energy transfer between the inflaton ( the scalar field driving the exponential expansion of the universe during inflation ) and ordinary matter . as was first pointed out in @xcite and discussed in detail in @xcite and in many other papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a coherently oscillating scalar field ( such as the inflaton during the period of reheating ) induces a parametric resonance instability in the mode equations of bosonic matter fields to which it couples .",
    "it has recently been realized that this resonance may also amplify gravitational waves @xcite , scalar gravitational fluctuations @xcite , and - within the limits imposed by the exclusion principle - fermionic modes @xcite .",
    "resonance instabilities are , in general , quite sensitive to the presence or absence of noise . in a real physical system one",
    "expects some noise in the evolution of the scalar field driving the resonance . in the case of inflation",
    ", such noise could be due to quantum fluctuations ( the same fluctuations which on larger length scales may develop into the seeds for galaxies and galaxy clusters ) or to thermal excitations . in both cases ,",
    "the amplitude of the noise is expected to be small . nevertheless , it is important to study the effects of noise on the parametric resonance instability .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied the effects of spatially homogeneous noise on the energy transfer between the inflaton @xmath0 and a second bosonic matter field @xmath1 .",
    "we were able to prove that - provided the noise is temporally uncorrelated on time scales on the order of the period of oscillation of the inflaton - the presence of noise increases the rate of energy transfer between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see also @xcite for similar results ) . more specifically , the exponential growth rate of a particular fourier mode @xmath2 of @xmath1 is given by the generalized floquet exponent @xmath3 .",
    "then , if the noise is given by a space - independent function @xmath4 , the following result holds @xcite : @xmath5 if @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , this implies that the stability bands ( the bands of @xmath7 values for which @xmath8 ) disappear completely .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the above result to the physically more realistic case of spatially inhomogeneous noise .",
    "this extension involves introducing nonlinearities into the physical system .",
    "inhomogeneous noise couples different fourier modes of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the mathematical analysis of the dynamics is much more complicated since the partial differential equation describing the evolution of @xmath1 can no longer be reduced via fourier transformation to a system of decoupled ordinary differential equations . however , by introducing an ultraviolet cutoff and by considering the system in a finite volume , we can reduce the problem to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "we are then able to show that the methods used in @xcite extend to this case .",
    "thus , for a given cutoff theory , the result ( [ eq1 ] ) can be shown to hold .",
    "when the cutoffs are removed , we obtain the slightly weaker result @xmath9 if @xmath10 , where the lyapunov exponent @xmath11 is the maximal lyapunov exponent of the inhomogeneous system .    by fourier transforming the configuration @xmath12 at each time , it is possible to define a generalized lyapunov exponent @xmath13 for each fourier mode .",
    "mode mixing induced by the inhomogeneous noise has the effect of distributing the energy which in the absence of noise would be dumped only into the original instability bands to all of the modes of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , it is not unreasonable to expect that a much stronger result than ( [ eq2 ] ) holds , namely that @xmath13 becomes larger than the maximal floquet index @xmath14 of the system in the absence of noise .",
    "indeed , we find numerical evidence which supports the following conjecture : @xmath15 for a general inhomogeneous noise function @xmath16 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "in the following section we introduce the dynamical system to be studied and review the approach of @xcite to proving ( [ eq1 ] ) . in section 3 ,",
    "the mathematically rigorous generalization of the proof to inhomogeneous noise is outlined , relegating some technical details to a companion paper @xcite .",
    "this yields a proof of ( [ eq2 ] ) . in section 4",
    "we indicate how the main result can be seen via a perturbative approach , and in section 5 we present numerical evidence for the much stronger statement of ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "our results apply for both systems with narrow and broad - band resonance . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the expansion of the universe ; however , we do not believe that including effects of expansion would change our main conclusions .",
    "the model we consider consists of two scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 with an interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a coefficient which parameterizes the strength of the interaction . in our application to inflationary cosmology , @xmath0 represents the inflaton field , the scalar field which drives inflation .",

    "we consider @xmath22 to be a background field .",

    "implies that the noise is ergodic , and therefore the generalized floquet exponent is well defined .",
    "the main result which was proved in @xcite is that @xmath11 is strictly larger than @xmath64 ; @xmath65 which demonstrates that the presence of noise leads to a strict increase in the rate of particle production .",

    "@xmath54 we obtain the action of the transfer matrix operator in the lie algebra of infinitesimal displacements @xmath115 @xmath116 this construction will be used in the derivation of our main results .",

    ", it is important to prove that the transfer matrix @xmath128 in the continuum system is a compact operator perturbation of the transfer matrix operator without noise .",
    "this implies that the perturbation can be well approximated by the corresponding transfer matrix operators of the finite dimensional approximate problem obtained after imposing the cutoffs . since a product of compact operators is compact , it is sufficient to prove that both @xmath129 and @xmath130 are compact independently ( the first term describes the difference in the transfer matrix when the periodic part of the perturbation , namely @xmath113 , is turned on , the second term expresses the effect of non - vanishing @xmath131 ) .",

    "discrete \" fourier transform of equation ( [ eq21 ] ) to get @xmath237 \\chi_{\\bf k}(t ) = - \\sum_{\\bf k ' }   q_{{\\bf k ' } - { \\bf k}}(t ) \\chi_{\\bf k'}(t)\\ , , \\label{eqnr1}\\ ] ] where @xmath238 $ ] , etc .",
    "let us analyze the time evolution of a given mode @xmath211",
    ". we can write ( [ eqnr1 ] ) in the following form @xmath239 \\chi_{\\bf k}(t ) =   f_{\\bf k}\\ , , \\label{eqnr2}\\ ] ] where @xmath240 does not contain @xmath241 and then may be thought of as an external force .",
    "the general solution to ( [ eqnr2 ] ) has the form @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the solution to the homogeneous equation @xmath244 \\chi_{\\bf k}(t ) =   0\\ , , \\label{eqnr4}\\ ] ] and @xmath245 is the particular solution of ( [ eqnr2 ] ) @xmath246 @xmath192 is the green function associated to ( [ eqnr4 ] ) @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are the two independent solutions of ( [ eqnr4 ] ) and @xmath250 is the wronskian , which in the present case is a constant .    equation ( [ eqnr4 ] ) is the same as the evolution equation for the @xmath211-mode of the boson field coupled to the inflaton during the pre - heating phase of the universe and in the presence of homogeneous noise .",
    "this problem was studied at length in @xcite .",
    "according to the results obtained in that analysis , the presence of ergodic noise strictly increases the rate of particle production .",
    "in other words , the generalized floquet exponent in the presence of noise @xmath251 is greater than @xmath121 , the floquet exponent for @xmath252 . we can write @xmath253 with @xmath254 .",
    "we then have two distinct situations to analyze depending upon whether the @xmath211 mode is in a resonance band or not .",
    "modes in a stability band have @xmath255 , while the modes in a resonance band have @xmath256 .    to simplify the discussion we neglect the contribution of @xmath257 , i.e. set @xmath258 in eq .",
    "( [ eqnr4 ] ) .",
    "this assumption will not change the qualitative results derived below . moreover , for the situations we are interested in , where the noise is in general small when compared to the amplitude of the inflaton , and for modes close to the center of the resonance band , @xmath259 is small compared to @xmath121 and can be neglected .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath211 is in a resonance band . then according to the theory of the hill equation , the solution to ( [ eqnr4 ] ) with @xmath252 is @xmath260 where @xmath261 and @xmath262 are bounded ( periodic ) functions of time .",
    "the solution to ( [ eqnr2 ] ) for the modes within any resonance band and for late times can be written as @xmath263 from the above result we see that @xmath264 has an exponentially growing component independent of @xmath265 .",
    "therefore , the exponential growth of a mode in a resonance band can only be destroyed by inhomogeneous noise if there is an exact cancellation between @xmath266 and @xmath265 .",
    "this is only possible if @xmath265 is given by ( at least for late times ) @xmath267 , which is very unlikely since the initial conditions for all the modes are involved ( see below ) .",
    "notice that @xmath265 can in fact grow exponentially in time and reinforce the increase of @xmath134 , since all modes are coupled through the term on the right hand side of ( [ eqnr1 ] ) .",
    "the result is a stimulated resonance effect on the particular components , even for modes in a stability band ( see below ) .",
    "we now study the time evolution of non - resonant modes .",
    "our goal is to estimate the rate of growth of such modes .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we take @xmath268 as above . therefore",
    ", the homogeneous solution @xmath266 is given by two independent periodic functions @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "as we are interested in the exponentially growing components , we are left with only the particular solution @xmath265 to compute . in the following",
    "we proceed to find an upper bound for this  particular \" solution .",
    "the results hold for all modes in a stability band . in order to estimate this solution , which is given by ( [ eqnr5 ] )",
    ", we first need an approximation for @xmath271 .",
    "let us then explicitly determine the contribution from the homogeneous and particular solutions of each mode . using ( [ eqnr3 ] ) and the definition of @xmath271 , we can write @xmath272 where @xmath273 and @xmath274 are periodic functions of @xmath122 . let us recall that @xmath275 , the floquet exponent , is ( according to our definition ) zero for modes in a stability band and positive for resonant modes . to begin with , we neglect bounded and decaying components in the above equation and keep just exponentially growing terms .",
    "thus , using ( [ eqnr6 ] ) and recalling that in the present case the solution @xmath248 and @xmath249 that enter the green s function @xmath192 are periodic functions of @xmath122 , we can write @xmath276 where @xmath277 stands for the sub - sets of the @xmath211-space @xmath278 , such that @xmath211 is in a resonance band . continuing our approximations , we consider the fastest growing term on the right had side of ( [ eqnr10 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath279 denote such a mode so we can cast ( [ eqnr10 ] ) in the form @xmath280 where @xmath281 stands for terms that grow slower than @xmath282 .",
    "the first term in the above equation guarantees an exponential growth of @xmath265 with the same rate as the fastest growing resonant mode .",
    "it is also worth noting that this leading term does not depend on the initial condition of the mode itself , but just on the initial conditions of the mode @xmath283 .",
    "this result holds for every mode in a stability band and is confirmed by numerical calculations as depicted in figure 2(a ) .",
    "note that in equation ( [ eqnr11 ] ) @xmath284 , since we assumed that @xmath211 is in a stability band while @xmath283 is the central mode of the broadest resonance band of the specific model considered . in a narrow resonance band regime",
    "@xmath283 corresponds to the central mode of the first resonance band . in a broad resonance regime",
    ", however , @xmath283 may not be the central mode , but it is still the mode which has the fastest exponential growth .",
    "for instance , in the model studied in @xcite , @xmath285 is the mode with the greatest floquet exponent .    to verify the previous qualitative results we performed a numerical analysis of the problem . following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is a constant , and the noise given in the form @xmath288 . here",
    ", @xmath33 is a positive constant , @xmath31 is a random function of time with characteristic time @xmath289 and amplitude equal to unity , and @xmath290 , also a random function with characteristic rate @xmath291 and amplitude 1 , depends only upon the magnitude of @xmath211 .",
    "we use the dimensionless time @xmath122 ( @xmath292 ) so that the evolution equation for @xmath2 reads @xmath293\\chi_k = \\lambda\\ , g\\ , n(t ) \\sum_{k'}\\chi_{k ' } m_{k'-k } \\ , , \\label{eqnr12}\\ ] ] where @xmath287 and @xmath294 are normalized with respect to the frequency @xmath125 of the inflaton field .",
    "let us stress that the amplitude of the noise was chosen to be very small , in such a way that all the corresponding homogeneous samples of the noise would not change the solution significantly .",
    "this choice assures that the effects we are about to show are consequence solely of the inhomogeneity of the noise .",
    "figure 2 shows a particular case of broad resonance where @xmath294 is of the form @xmath295 ( @xmath7 is also in units of @xmath125 ) , with @xmath296 . in this particular case , @xmath297 is chosen to be a smooth function of @xmath7 which helps us to show that the growth of modes outside a resonance band does not depend upon their initial conditions ( see below ) .",
    "this figure shows clearly the stimulated resonance of the modes in a stability band .",
    "2(a ) shows a particular case of broad resonance in the absence of noise .",
    "the random peaks arise because we have chosen random initial conditions for both @xmath134 and @xmath298 at @xmath299 . in fig 2(a ) the ratio between the amplitudes of the modes in the stability band ( for @xmath300 ) and the central mode is @xmath301 , while in fig 2(b ) , which shows the results when inhomogeneous noise is present , that ratio is @xmath302 .",
    "observe that in fig 2(b ) all modes outside the resonance band have almost the same amplitude .",
    "the absence of peaks in that region demonstrates the independence of the amplitudes on the initial conditions of such modes .",
    "those amplitudes depend strongly on the initial conditions and floquet exponent of the central mode @xmath303 .",
    "only @xmath304 modes were taken into account in this example .",
    "figures 3(a)3(c ) show even more explicitly the effects of inhomogeneities in the noise . in this case",
    "@xmath7 is normalized in such a way that it assumes @xmath305 different values between @xmath306 end @xmath307 . in 3(a ) no noise is present and we can identify the first resonance band .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the result when we introduced homogeneous noise .",
    "the noise is random in both @xmath122 and @xmath7 and the amplitude is small , @xmath308 .",
    "very small effects due to the noise are observed . only modes within the resonance band",
    "grow exponentially , exactly as in the case of fig .",
    "3(a ) . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "3(c ) we observe a very distinct behavior of the modes outside the resonance gap .",
    "all the modes have explosive growth , and we can not distinguish the stability region from the resonance band anymore .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the noise has large effects even in the case studied here , where the amplitude of the noise is small compared to the amplitude of the potential @xmath113 .",
    "another interesting point is related to the abovementioned spacing @xmath126 between two successive modes .",
    "we can easily see how the floquet exponent depends on @xmath126 by comparing fig .",
    "3(c ) with fig .",
    "4 . in the last case we used the same parameters as in 3(c ) ,",
    "only the normalization of @xmath7 is different : @xmath305 modes are placed between @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "@xmath311 was chosen to be a symmetric ( otherwise random ) matrix in @xmath7 and @xmath312 in both the cases of fig .",
    "3(c ) and fig .",
    "4 . the floquet exponent increases when the number of fourier modes is increased .",
    "this can be understood since it corresponds to decreasing @xmath126 between two neighboring modes . as a result",
    ", we are adding the contribution of a larger number of very close modes which are inside the resonance band , all of them contributing with exponentially growing amplitudes , on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqnr12 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown ( modulo some technical points which will be demonstrated in a companion paper ) that spatially inhomogeneous noise in the oscillating field which induces the parametric resonance instability does not decrease the floquet exponent of the instability .",
    "this extends the results of @xcite where it was shown that homogeneous noise leads to an increase in the floquet exponent for each fourier mode .",
    "crucial to our proof was the truncation of the dynamical system to a finite dimensional one by means of infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs , use of the furstenberg theorem concerning the lyapunov exponent of products of identically distributed random matrices , and the use of compactness arguments to carry over the main results as the cutoffs are removed .",
    "we have also provided numerical evidence ( backed up with approximate analytical calculations ) which indicate that a much stronger result is true , namely that inhomogeneous noise will spread the exponential growth of the most resonant mode of the system without noise to all of the fourier modes .",
    "an interesting challenge is to provide a mathematically rigorous proof of this stronger result .",
