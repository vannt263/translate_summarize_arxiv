    "sextans  a and sextans  b are both dwarf irregular galaxies ( ir v and ir iv - v morphological types , respectively , cf .",
    "van den bergh @xcite , hereafter vdb00 ) with approximately the same v luminosity , belonging to the outer fringes of the local group .",
    "their distances from the barycenter of the lg are quite similar ( 1.60 and 1.72 mpc , see vdb00 ) and their separation on the sky is relatively small ( @xmath0 10 degree ) , which corresponds to about 280  kpc .",
    "moreover their velocity difference is only 23 @xmath16 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these results suggest the hypothesis of a common formation of these two galaxies , probably together with ngc  3109 and the antlia galaxy . considering the mean distance of the four galaxies from the barycenter of the lg , 1.7  mpc ,",
    "this sub - group is located beyond the zero velocity surface of the lg ( cf .",
    "vdb00 ) and thus it can be considered the nearest external group of galaxies . as said by mateo ( @xcite )",
    "`` no two local group dwarfs have the same star - formation history '' .",
    "this is true also when comparing very similar galaxies .",
    "in fact , in spite of a probable common formation , sextans  a and sextans  b show a different star formation history as indicated by the different amounts of stars in the various evolutionary phases , and also reflected in the different number of pne and hii regions observed .",
    "sextans a shows a large amount of old stellar population , whereas it has a modest intermediate ( 4 - 10  gyrs ago ) and recent star formation ( 1 - 4  gyrs ago ) . on the other hand ,",
    "sextans b exhibits a very strong recent star formation ( 1 - 4  gyrs ago ) , together with a very old population ( cf .",
    "( @xcite review about the star formation history of the lg dwarfs ) .    in this context ,",
    "pne represent an useful tool to trace the chemical enrichment history of galaxies , moreover when compared with chemical abundance derived from h  ii regions , because they are tracers of stellar population in a wide range of ages , from old to intermediate age .",
    "pne ( 1 in sextans  a and 5 in sextans  b ) and h  ii regions ( 10 and 9 , respectively ) have been observed in december 2003 with vlt ( eso , paranal ) equipped with fors2 spectrograph in multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) observing mode . the fors2 spectrograph was used with two setup : the 300  v and 300  i gratings providing a dispersion of 3.0  / pixel .",
    "the total resulting spectral range , from @xmath03200 to @xmath010000  , includes basic lines needed for the determination of chemical abundances .",
    "for each galaxy , a total of six exposures were taken , three with the 300  v grating ( total exposure time 5400  s ) and three using the 300  i one ( 3600  s ) .",
    "a spectrophotometric standard star , gd  108 , was observed once during each night .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf longslit package and complemented with midas ( mos and long packages ) .",
    "the spectra are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . identified emission lines are marked with the name of the corresponding ion and/or wavelength .",
    "chemical abundances have been derived with the classic ionization correction factors ( icfs ) method , following kingsburgh & barlow ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the [ o  iii ] 4363 emission line was always measurable with a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio , the [ o  iii ] electron temperature was derived for all pne . as the nitrogen emission lines are so intense in sextans a , the [ n  ii ] 5755 is observed and an electron temperature is derived .",
    "[ s  iii ] infrared emission lines were detected in 4 pne .",
    "they allow a better accuracy in the measurement of sulphur abundance , especially in low metallicity environments where [ s  ii ] lines are extremely faint .",
    "in addition , pne have been modelled with the phoionization code cloudy 94.00 ( ferland et al .",
    "@xcite ) , assuming a blackbody central star with effective temperature derived using the ambartsumian s ( @xcite ) or gurzadyan s ( @xcite ) methods , and a spherical nebula with constant density , derived from [ s  ii ] 6717/6731  flux ratio when available or assumed equal to 3000 @xmath3 in the other cases . for further details on the modelling procedure",
    "see magrini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and perinotto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the chemical abundances derived with the two methods are in good agreement one to each other . the cloudy model allowed to derive also some nebular and stellar parameters as the radius of the nebula , the stellar luminosity and temperature ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . the preliminary chemical abundances and their errors , derived with the icfs method , are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".chemical abundances of sextans  a and sextans  b planetary nebulae derived with the icfs method .",
    "metal abundances are expressed in 12+@xmath4(x / h ) . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    although the definition of type i pne is a function of metallicity of the host galaxy ( cf .",
    "magrini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as a first approximation , we applied the galactic type  i definition by kingsburgh & barlow ( @xcite ) , @xmath4(n / o)@xmath5 - 0.1 . with this definition , the sextans  a pn is a type  i pn , while the sextans  b pne are non - type  i. using the stellar luminosity and temperature derived with the cloudy model , we compared the location of the six pne in the @xmath4t@xmath6-@xmath4l@xmath6 space with the h - burning evolutionary tracks from vassiliadis & wood ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found a more massive progenitor for the sextans  a pn ( @xmath02.5m@xmath7 ) than those of sextans  b pne ( @xmath01 - 1.5m@xmath7 ) , in agreement with its type  i nature .",
    "another interesting aspect from table  [ tab1 ] is the large range of o / h , @xmath00.7  dex , of sextans  b pne in spite of their similar evolutionary age .",
    "since oxygen is not processed by pn progenitors , this represents a sign of the dishomogeneity of the interstellar medium at the time of the formation of the pn progenitors .",
    "we plan to compare this dishomogeneity with the spatial distribution of h  ii regions chemical abundances .",
    "in fig .  [ fig3 ] , the relationship of v - luminosity vs. oxygen abundance from pne in the lg is shown .",
    "galaxies are identified with different symbols according to their morphological type .",
    "a different behaviour of star forming ( irregulars and spirals ) and non - star forming ( spheroidals ) galaxies was already noted by several authors ( cf .",
    "mateo @xcite ) : spheroidal galaxies are generally metal richer than irregular galaxies with the same v luminosity .",
    "there are several hypotesys about this behaviour ( cf .",
    "pilyugin @xcite ) , but a satisfatctory understanding is still missing . the uniform way to derive chemical abundances with pne , which are present in galaxies of every morphological type , will help to understand the origins of this fundamental relation .",
