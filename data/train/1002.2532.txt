    "<S> the branching ratio and direct cp asymmetry of the decay mode @xmath0 have been calculated within the qcd factorization approach in both the standard model ( sm ) and the non - universal @xmath1 model . in the standard model , </S>",

    "<S> although most of the experimental data are consistent with the standard model ( sm ) predictions , it is believed that the sm is just an effective theory of a more fundamental one yet to be discovered . </S>",
    "<S> one way of searching for new physics beyond the sm is by studying the rare @xmath5 decay modes , which are induced by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions , since such rare decays arise only from the loop level within the sm . over the years </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to note that the non - universal @xmath1 couplings could lead to fcnc in the tree level as well as introduce new weak phases , which are essential in inducing the cp asymmetries . </S>",

    "<S> the contribution of the non - perturbative sector is dominated by the form factors of @xmath16 transition and the non - factorizable impact in the hadronic matrix elements is controlled by hard gluon exchange . </S>",
