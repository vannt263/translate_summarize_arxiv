    "the electron spin states in bulk semiconductor and heterostructures have attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "experiments indicate very long spin decoherence times and small transition rates between states of different spin @xcite .",
    "these promising results have motivated proposals for information processing based on electron spins in quantum dots , which might lead to a realization of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "a quantum dot is region where electrons are confined .",
    "the energy spectrum is discrete , due to the small size , and can display atomic - like properties @xcite . here",
    "we will consider quantum dots in gaas - algaas heterostructures .",
    "the main reasons for studying them are that relevant quantum dots are fabricated in such structures and ga and as nuclei have a substantial hyperfine interactions with the conduction electrons .",
    "there are two main types of gate controlled dots in these systems , so - called vertical and lateral dots@xcite .",
    "they differ in transverse confinement , which is approximately a triangular well and a square well for the lateral and vertical dots , respectively .",
    "manipulation the electron spin while maintaining phase coherence requires that it should be relatively well isolated from the environment . coupling a quantum dot , or any closed quantum system , to its environment can cause decoherence and dissipation .",
    "one of the measures of the strength of the coupling to the environment are the transition rates , or inverse lifetimes , between the quantum dot states . in gaas",
    "there are two main mechanisms that can cause finite lifetimes of spin states .",
    "these are the spin - orbit interaction and the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei .",
    "if a magnetic field is applied the change in zeeman energy accompanying a spin - flip has to be absorbed by phonon emission . for two electron quantum dots , where the transitions are between triplet and singlet spin states , both spin - orbit@xcite and",
    "hyperfine@xcite mediated transitions have been studied . in both cases",
    "the transition rates are much smaller than the usual phonon rates , the spin - orbit rate being the higher except when the excited singlet and triplet states cross.@xcite for low magnetic fields , i.e.   away from the single - triplet transition , the energy of the emitted phonon can be quite large and the transitions involve deformation phonons rather than piezoelectric ones .",
    "if there is odd number of electrons in the dot the ground - state is usually a spin doublet so that energy change associated with the spin - flip is the electron zeeman energy .",
    "owing to the small @xmath0-factor in gaas this energy is rather small compared to the level spacing and the dominating phonon mechanism is due to piezoelectric phonons .",
    "recently spin - orbit mediated spin - flip transitions between zeeman levels was investigated@xcite .",
    "due to kramer s degeneracy the transition amplitude for the spin - flip is proportional to the zeeman splitting .",
    "this results in a spin - orbit spin - flip rate proportional to the fifth power of the zeeman splitting .    in this publication",
    "we consider hyperfine mediated transitions between zeeman split levels in a quantum dot .",
    "the transition amplitude remains finite at zero external magnetic field , giving a spin - flip rate ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalrate ] ) ) that is proportional to the cube of the zeeman splitting .",
    "the cause of this is an internal magnetic field due to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "we consider the important concept of internal magnetic field in some detail . since the parameters of hyperfine interaction between conduction band electrons and underlying nuclei in gaas have been extensively investigated @xcite , including the overhauser effect and spin - relaxation in gaas / algaas heterostructures @xcite , we are able now to predict the typical time scale for this process in particular quantum dot geometries .    upon completion of this work we learned about recent results of khaetskii , loss and glazman @xcite .",
    "they consider essentially the same situation and model and obtain _ electron spin decoherence _ without considering any mechanism of dissipation .",
    "this is in clear distinction from the present result for _ spin - flip rate _ that requires a mechanism of dissipation , i.e.  phonons .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sectionii ] the model used is introduced in addition to the basic assumptions and approximations used , section [ sectioniii ] deals with the internal magnetic field due to the hyperfine interaction and section [ sectioniv ] contains the derivation of the transition rates .",
    "finally , in section [ sectionv ] the results are discussed .",
    "we consider a quantum dot embedded in a algaas / gaas heterostructure .",
    "the details of the quantum dot eigenstates are not important for now , it suffices to say that the energy spectrum is discrete and the wave functions are localized in space .",
    "the spatial extension of the wavefunction in the lateral and transverse direction ( growth direction ) are denoted with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "quantum dots in these heterostructures are formed at a gaas / algaas interface , where the confining potential is very strong so that @xmath3 .",
    "we define the volume occupied by an electron as @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dot can be written on the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the eigenenergies which depend on the structure of the confining potential and the applied magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field also couples to the electron spin via the zeeman term .    since the @xmath7 point of the conduction band in gaas",
    "is mainly composed of @xmath8 orbitals the dipole interaction with the nuclei vanishes and the hyperfine interaction can be described by the usual contact term @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes , respectively , the spin and position of the electron ( @xmath14th nuclei ) .",
    "the delta function indicates the point - like nature of the contact interaction will result in a position dependant coupling .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath15 has the dimension volume@xmath16energy . to get a notion of the related energy scale , it is straightforward to relate @xmath15 to the energy splitting of the doublet for a fully polarized nuclear system , @xmath17 @xmath18 being density of nuclei and @xmath19 is the spin of a nucleus . in gaas",
    "this energy is @xmath20mev , which corresponds to a magnetic field of about 5t.@xcite for a given quantum dot geometry the number of nuclei occupying the dot is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "since the ga and as nuclei have the same spin and their coupling constants are comparable , we will assume that all the nuclear sites are characterized by the same hyperfine coupling @xmath15 , and the @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lattice spacing .",
    "for realistic quantum dots @xmath24 , and it is therefore an important big parameter in the problem .    the coupling between the electron and the phonon bath is represented with @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are creation and annihilation operator for the phonon mode with wave - vector @xmath28 on brach @xmath29 . in gaas there are two different coupling mechanisms , deformation ones and piezoelectric ones . for transitions between zeeman split levels in gaas , i.e.  low energy emission , the most effective phonon mechanism is due to piezoelectric phonons .",
    "we will assume that the heterostructure is grown in the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "this is the case for almost all dots and it imposes important symmetry relations on the coupling coefficient .",
    "the square of the coupling coefficient for the piezoelectric phonons is then given by ( see ref .  ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the piezoelectric coefficient , @xmath32 is the mass density , @xmath33 is the speed of sound of branch @xmath29 , @xmath34 is normalization volume and we have defined @xmath35 and the @xmath36 s are the so - called anisotropy functions , see appendix [ app : integral ] .",
    "in this section we will introduce the concept of the effective magnetic field , the _ internal field _ , acting on the electron due to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "this internal field is a semiclassical approximation to the nuclear system , this approximation being valid in the limit of large number of nuclei , @xmath37 . if the nuclei are noticeably polarized , this field almost coincides with the overhauser field that represents the average nuclear polarization .",
    "it is important that the internal field persists even at zero polarization giving rise to doublet splitting of the order @xmath38 .",
    "first we write the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hyperfinehamiltonian ] ) in the basis of the electron orbital states and present it as a sum of two terms @xmath39 where the terms are defined as @xmath40 by definition @xmath41 does not couple different orbital levels . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : electronhamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : h0hyperfine ] ) one obtains the following hamiltonian @xmath42 we will regard the mixing term @xmath43 as a perturbation to @xmath44 .",
    "the justification for this is that the typical fluctuations of the electron energy due to the hyperfine interaction are much smaller than the orbital energy separation , @xmath45 .",
    "we now concentrate on @xmath44 and formulate semiclassical description of it . for this",
    "we consider the operator of the orbitally dependent effective magnetic field ; @xmath46 where @xmath47 our goal is to replace the operator @xmath48 with a classical field . to prove the replacement is reasonable we calculate the average of the square for a given unpolarized nuclear state @xmath49 @xmath50 } ( i+1)/i\\ ] ] where @xmath51}=\\int d\\bm{r } v_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize qd}}}^{n-1 }     on the wave function of the orbital @xmath52 .",
    "we can not simply replace @xmath48 by its eigenvalues : as in the case of the usual spin algebra , different components of @xmath48 do not commute .",
    "in addition its square does not commute with individual components , @xmath53 \\neq 0 $ ] . to estimate fluctuations of @xmath48",
    "we calculate the uncertainty relations between its components @xmath54 since @xmath55 we have proved that the quantum fluctuations in @xmath48 are much smaller than its typical amplitude .",
    "the semiclassical picture introduced above is only valid for high temperatures , @xmath56 , where there are many states available to the nuclear system and the typical length is proportional to @xmath57 . for temperatures below @xmath58 the nuclear system",
    "will predominantly be in the ground state and the classical picture breaks down .",
    "this is similar to the quantum mechanical description of a particle moving in a potential . at zero temperature",
    "it will be localized in some potential minimum and quantum mechanics will dominate . at sufficiently high temperatures the particle occupies higher energy states and its motion",
    "is well described by classical mechanics .",
    "having established this we can replace the average over the density matrix of the nuclei by the average over a classical field @xmath59 , note that it has no ` hat ' , whose values are gaussian distributed @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the average , or overhauser , field assuming small degree of polarization .",
    "the effective magnetic field acting on the electron is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the unit vector along the total field for a given @xmath59 , see fig.[fig : figure1 ] . for this configuration",
    "the spin eigenfunctions are @xmath64 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath65 the effective zeeman hamiltonian is then @xmath66 in this given internal field configuration .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath44 thus consists of many doublets distinguished by the value of @xmath67 .",
    "the magnitude of the effective field @xmath68 determines the zeeman splitting of the each doublet @xmath69 where @xmath70 the external field zeeman energy .",
    "we conclude this section with two remarks concerning time and energy scales .",
    "first , since the dynamics of @xmath59 is essentially the dynamics of the nuclear system it changes on a time scale of the nuclear relaxation , which can be quite long.@xcite for electron dynamics on shorter timescales @xmath59 plays the role of a ` frozen disorder ' . at",
    "longer time scales self - averaging over all configurations of @xmath59 takes place .",
    "second , the rms value of @xmath59 is approximately @xmath71@xmath72ev which corresponds to a 100gauss field ( for a value @xmath73 ) .",
    "we concentrate on the transitions between the doublet components in eq.([eq : doublet ] ) . assuming that the higher energy doublet state is initially occupied",
    ", we will calculate the transition rate to the lower one .",
    "the transition must be accompanied by energy dissipation equal to @xmath74 .",
    "this energy can not be absorbed be the nuclear system.@xcite so we need an external mechanism of energy dissipation .",
    "the most effective one is known to be phonons .",
    "however the phonons alone can not change the electron spin so we need a mechanism which mixes spin and orbital degrees of freedom , that is @xmath43 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vhyperfine ] ) .",
    "thus the transition amplitude is proportional to both @xmath43 and the electron phonon coupling @xmath75 .",
    "here we assume that the electron is in the lowest orbital state @xmath76 since the phonon mechanism will bring the electron to this state from any higher orbital on timescales much smaller than those related to transtions between the doublet components .",
    "thus we consider an initial state of the entire system @xmath77 which is a product state of the electron , nuclear @xmath78 and phonon @xmath79 systems and the final state @xmath80 .",
    "the transition amplitude between them , in second order perturbation theory , reads @xmath81 the summation is over virtual states involving higher orbitals and the denominators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transitionamplitude ] ) contains the energy differences between different orbital states .",
    "the internal field depends on the orbital state , resulting in a rather complicated expression .",
    "albeit the energy related to the internal field is much smaller than the orbital separation so we can safely replace the zeeman splitting with @xmath82 .",
    "the reason for that is that only at high external fields where @xmath83 will the effects of the zeeman splitting be appreciable in the denominator .",
    "the internal field also appears in the phonon rate since it determines the electron energy difference between the initial and final state .",
    "since @xmath75 does not connect different nuclear states and conversely @xmath43 does not mix different phonon states the sums over intermediate phonon and nuclear states reduce to a single term . from this transition amplitude the transition rate is obtained via fermis golden rule @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy difference between the initial and final state of the combined systems . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : transitionamplitude ] ) into eq.([eq : fermisgoldenrule ] ) we get the following relation for the spin - flip rate    @xmath86    the spin - flip rate depends on the initial state of the nuclear system @xmath78 .",
    "this poses the problem of how to deal with the nuclear state @xmath78 , since we already demoted all the spin operators to a collective classical variable .",
    "a conceptually simple solution lies in the fact that when eq.([eq : transitionrate ] ) and ( [ eq : vhyperfine ] ) are considered together one sees that the rate is a sum over all pairs of nuclei in the system .",
    "focusing on a given pair of nuclei @xmath14 and @xmath87 , all the other nuclei are unchanged when the electron spin is ` scattered ' on by this pair .",
    "by simply redefining the classical field such that it is composed of all nuclei except this given pair we can circumvent the problem .",
    "this procedure will not change our previous result regarding the properties of @xmath59 and also defining @xmath88 makes it straightforward to work with the nuclear states in eq.([eq : transitionrate ] ) .",
    "although the transition rate can be very slow , the typical duration of a transition event is set by energy uncertainty , @xmath89 .",
    "this is much shorter than the typical time for nuclear spin relaxation so that the nuclear system is frozen in a given configuration of @xmath90 . in this case",
    "taking an average over @xmath90 is not well motivated since a given configuration of @xmath90 is fixed .",
    "for now we will postpone the average over the classical field . after performing a thermal average over @xmath78 in the transition rate",
    "we obtain the following    @xmath91    where @xmath92 . here",
    "we have introduced the one - site nuclear spin correlation function @xmath93 , which is evaluated in appendix [ app : gcorr ] .",
    "the denominator has been expanded to second order in the zeeman splitting .",
