    "all known normal nuclei are made of the two nucleons , the proton and the neutron .",
    "besides those two lightest baryons there exist still a couple of other stable ( but weakly decaying ) baryons , the hyperons . up to now the inclusion of multiple units of strangeness in nuclei",
    "remains experimentally as theoretically rather largely unexplored .",
    "this lack of investigation reflects the experimental task in producing nuclei containing ( weakly decaying ) strange baryons , which is conventionally limited by replacing one neutron ( or at maximum two ) by a strange @xmath0-particle in scattering experiments with pions or kaons .",
    "there exists nowadays a broad knowledge about single hypernuclei , i.e. nuclei , where one nucleon is substituted by a @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) by means of the exchange reaction @xmath3 . over the last two decades",
    "a rich phenomology has resulted for such hypernuclei .    however , there exist more or less no experimental insight how more than one hyperon behave inside a nuclei .",
    "the technical problem is to create within a tiny moment , smaller than the decay time of a hyperon , enough hyperons and then to bring them together with nucleons to form any potential multihypernucleus . by employing a relativistic shell model calculation , which gives a rather excellent description of normal nuclei and single @xmath1-hypernuclei",
    ", it was found that such configurations might exist as ( small ) bound multihypernuclei ( memo - metastable exotic multihypernuclear object ) @xcite .",
    "strange matter could also be realized in a completely different picture .",
    "indeed , this second and much more speculative possibility was raised by physicists much earlier .",
    "the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics , does not forbid the principle existence of ` larger ' hadronic particles , so called multiquark states .",
    "today only the mesons and baryons are known in nature .",
    "however , there could exist states with more than three quarks .",
    "going further with this speculation one comes to the conclusion that only multiquark states with nearly the same number of up , down and strange quarks might exist as ( meta-)stable configurations @xcite .",
    "such a very speculative form of strange matter is called strange quark matter .",
    "( ultra-)relativistic heavy ion collisions provide the only ( earth based ) source for the formation of either strangelets ( small lumps of strange quark matter ) or multi - hypernuclear objects , consisting of nucleons , @xmath1 s and @xmath4 s , as dozens of hyperons are produced in a single central event . in principle",
    ", strangelets can be produced via two different scenarios : by a condensation out of a quark - gluon plasma or by a coalescence of hyperons out of the created hot and dense fireball .",
    "for the former scenario it is essential that within the phase transition of the deconfined matter to hadronic particles the _ net _ strangeness ( counting a surplus of strange over antistrange quarks ) is getting enriched in the plasma phase .",
    "this distillation ( or separation ) of strangeness , i.e. the possible conglomeration of net strangeness , has been predicted to occur for a first order phase transition of a baryonrich qgp @xcite . in particular , if the strangelet does exist in principle , it has to be regarded as a cold , stable and bound manifestation of that phase being a remnant or ` ash ' of the originally hot qgp - state . on the other hand a further necessary request for the possible condensation",
    "is that the initially hot plasma phase has to cool down considerably during the ongoing phase transition . within our present knowledge of the phase transition such a behaviour",
    "can neither be unambiqously shown to happen nor be excluded .    in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the reasons for the ( possible ) existence of this novel and exotic states . in section 3",
    "the mechanism of strangeness distillation and the possible production of small strange matter states are reviewed .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing the detection possibilities of small and finite strangelets with respect to their lifetimes against strong or weak hadronic decays . in section 4",
    "we finally sketch on how the physics of strange matter can affect the physical picture of dense neutron stars and the issue of baryonic dark matter .",
    "the first speculation about the possible existence of collapsed nuclei was given by bodmer @xcite .",
    "he argued that another form of baryonic matter might be more stable than ordinary nuclei .",
    "indeed it was speculated there both on the possible existence of hyperonic matter with baryons as colorless constituents or strange quark matter with quarks as major constituents .",
    "the paper , however , lacked detailed calculation as the mit bag model or walecka model were only available a few years later .",
    "let us now briefly summarize how a stable or metastable strangelet might look like @xcite : think of bulk objects , containing a large number of quarks @xmath5 , so - called multiquark droplets .",
    "multiquark states consisting only of u- and d - quarks must have a mass larger than ordinary nuclei , otherwise normal nuclei would be unstable .",
    "however , the situation is different for droplets of sqm , which would contain approximately the same amount of u- , d- and s - quarks .",
    "speculations on the stability of strangelets are based on the following observations : ( 1 ) the ( weak ) decay of a s - quark into a d - quark could be suppressed or forbidden because the lowest single particle states are occupied .",
    "( 2 ) the strange quark mass can be lower than the fermi energy of the u- or d - quark in such a dense quark droplet .",
    "opening a new flavour degree of freedom therefore tends to lower the fermi energy and hence also the mass per baryon of the strangelet .",
    "sqm may then appear as a nearly neutral state",
    ".    if the mass of a strangelet is smaller than the mass of the corresponding ordinary nucleus with the same baryon number , the strangelet would be absolutely stable and thus be the true groundstate of nuclear matter @xcite . within the mit bag model very low phenomenological bag parameters @xmath6",
    "mev have to be employed for modeling such a possibility . on the other hand",
    ", it is also conceivable that the mass per baryon of a strange droplet is lower than the mass of the strange @xmath1- baryon , but larger than the nucleon mass ( see fig .",
    "the droplet is then in a metastable state , it can not decay spontanously into @xmath1 s . for bag parameters",
    "b@xmath7 lower than 190 mev strange quark droplets can only decay via weak interactions . for larger b - values strangelets",
    "are instable .",
    "due to the strong finite size effects @xcite and the wider range of the employed model parameters , smaller strangelets are much more likely to be metastable than being absolutely stable .",
    "also the possible influence of color magnetic and color electric potentials has been necglected in these calculations due to their complicated group structure . for very light strangelets with",
    "baryon number @xmath8 it turns out @xcite that such contributions are in fact repulsive , making the possible candidates less stable ( with the well - known exception of the h dibaryon ) .",
    "a classification scheme for metastable combinations of nucleons and hyperons exhibits that combinations of nucleons , @xmath0 s and @xmath9 s are favoured compared to combinations with @xmath10 s due to their q - values in vacuum @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the single particle levels of a strange nucleus consisting of two of each proton , neutron , @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are plotted . note that each baryon sits in the 1s - state .",
    "the reaction @xmath13 can not induce a strong decay because the two @xmath0 s sitting in the 1s - level cause the produced @xmath0 s to escape in vacuum .",
    "but this is energetically unfavoured resulting in an overall metastable compound system .",
    "the calculation was carried out in a relativistic mean field model taking care of the nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - hyperon interaction .",
    "an extension of this model also implements the scarce information about the hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "this is done by introducing two new meson fields into the theory , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which couple to strange baryons only @xcite .",
    "the binding energy for memos will be moderately enhanced ( on a scale of nuclear binding energies ) due to this additional interactions .",
    "indeed , binding energies of @xmath16  mev and more have been found with a net strangeness fraction of @xmath17 .",
    "even negatively charged strange nuclear systems are possible without loosing stability .",
    "the lightest stable object of this type is likely to be @xmath18 .",
    "the global properties of a strangelet or a memo are likely to be identical : a similar small charge @xmath19 and nearly the same average baryon density @xmath20 . in turn",
    ", this would suggest that a nearly neutral and heavy candiate could not unambiguosly be considered as a strangelet . in principle , to distinguish experimentally between both one has in addition to resolve the mass @xmath21 very accurately .",
    "a memo is only bound in the order of @xmath22 mev whereas the strangelet may be bound from @xmath23 mev ( which is , of course , speculation ) .",
    "the resembling microscopic structure gives raise to the speculation that both states might have a strong overlap and correlation .",
    "the memo would decay into a strangelet , if the latter is energetically more favourable .",
    "multiple collisions in the reaction of two bombarding nuclei ensure that the interacting system starts to equilibrate which might be suited to search for the most interesting collective effects .",
    "in particular all exotic objects need for their formation _ large strange particle numbers , high degree of equilibration _ and _ large densities . _ in order to get this kind of states one should therefore use high energies to produce enough strangeness and energy density , and heavy nuclei to gain as much equilibration as possible .",
    "this situation is now achieved at brookhaven ags using au+au and at cern sps using pb+pb .",
    "it may then be possible to produce some of the lightest multistrange objects in the laboratory .      in the following we want to sketch why the production of sqm clusters , if they do exist in principle , is likely , if a baryon rich and hot deconfined qgp is created in such collisions .",
    "the net strangeness of the qgp is zero from the onset , although an equal , however large , number of strange and antistrange quarks has been produced .",
    "however , there is a physical mechanism which separates the strange quarks from their antiparticles @xcite ( see fig .",
    "it is ` simple ' for the antistrange quarks to materialize in kaons k(@xmath24 ) because of the lots of light quarks as compared to the s - quarks which could only move into the suppressed antikaons ( @xmath25 ) or the heavy hyperons .",
    "hence , during a near equilibrium phase transition a large antistrangeness builds up in the hadron matter while the qgp retains a large net strangeness excess .    for modeling the evolution of an initially hot fireball a two phase equilibrium description between the hadron gas and the qgp",
    "was combined with nonequilibrium radiation by incorporating the rapid freeze - out of hadrons from the hadron phase surrounding the qgp droplet during a first order phase transition ( last reference of @xcite ) .",
    "two scenarios may describe the evolution to the final state : the quark droplet may remain unstable until the strange quarks have clustered into @xmath1-particles and other strange hadrons to carry away the strangeness and the plasma has completely vanished into standard particles . this scenario is customarily accepted",
    ". however , if sqm exists at low temperatures in configurations having a mass per baryon lower than the mass of the @xmath1-particle , the hot sqm droplet would remain at the phase transition boundary much longer . as shown in @xcite , producing strange baryons like @xmath0 particles is energetically more expensive and therefore less likely than producing sqm like strangelets . towards the end of the evolution",
    "only baryons are allowed to escape from the droplet , since at this point all of the antiquarks are gone .",
    "the baryons will be mostly nucleons , since the hyperons are heavier and require more energy for formation .",
    "these nucleons remove energy but they do not carry away any strange quarks , so the ratio of strange to nonstrange quarks increases further , refining the distillation of strangeness .",
    "the hot strange matter in fact might cool down to cold lumps of size @xmath26 , depending on the original baryon content of the plasma .",
    "3b gives an impression how the hadronisation proceeds for a large bag constant ( @xmath27 mev  no strangelet in the groundstate ) and a small bag constant ( @xmath28 mev ) .",
    "for the large bag constant the system hadronizes completely in @xmath29 8 @xmath30 , which is customarily expected and thus not too surprising . yet , a strong increase of the net strangeness of the system is found in both situations , and the plasma drop reaches a strangeness fraction of @xmath31 when the volume becomes small .",
    "indeed , for the small bag constant , however , a _ cold _ strangelet emerges from the expansion and evaporation process with an approximate baryon number of @xmath32 17 , a radius of @xmath33 , and a net strangeness fraction of @xmath34 , i.e. a charge to baryon ratio @xmath35 !",
    "if a baryon rich qgp is temporarily created it will assemble the strange quarks during the ongoing evolution and expansion .",
    "it might either lead to the formation of a strangelet , or it will decay mainly into hyperons in its late stage . the strangelet would be a remnant or ` ash ' of the deconfined quark matter phase and thus would provide a signal for the formation of a qgp @xcite .",
    "as emphasized already in the introduction , for the possible condensation of small pieces of strange quark matter out of an initially hot qgp with no net strangeness two mechanisms have to be realized by nature : ( 1 ) strangeness distillation and ( 2 ) ongoing cooling ( e.g. by pion evaporation ) during the phase transition resulting in a loss of internal heat .",
    "the strangeness distillation during the hadronization of a baryonrich qgp is a very intuitive process .",
    "it works for all model parameters like e.g. also much higher bag constants @xcite . in a recent study",
    "the above described model including particle evaporation from the outer surface has been combined within 1-dimensional longitudinal hydrodynamical expansion @xcite with initial conditions expected at cern - sps energies and future rhic energies .",
    "again , a strong accumulation of net strangeness in the plasma phase has been found during the ongoing phase transition . still , the mechanism by which a qgp state is converted into hadrons is a major uncertainty in the different descriptions",
    ". the hadronisation transition has often been described by geometric and statistical models , where the matter is assumed to be in partial or complete equilibrium during the whole expansion phase .",
    "a fully microscopic and numerical model of the hadronization of confined and color - neutral hadrons out of a deconfined plasma has very recently been realized within the friedberg - lee model by traxler et al .",
    "exploratory studies of a baryonrich system within this model have shown in fact that the strangeness distillation is a genuine feature of the hadronisation .",
    "it might , however , be very difficult to experimentally verify that this distillation indeed happens during the transition .",
    "we remark that the separation mechanism might be probed by density interferometry with hyperons or kaons @xcite . the hadrons with negative strangeness , the @xmath1 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "are expected to be produced mainly at the last stage of the phase transition when the size of the quark phase volume has become quite small .",
    "the realization of the second mechanism by nature , i.e. the necessary ongoing cooling for final possible strangelet condensation , is not as obvious .",
    "it was pointed out already in the second ref . of @xcite",
    "that the strangelet formation can only go hand in hand with strong cooling rather than reheating . besides the expansion of the system additional pion and nucleon evaporation should help to allow for a possible , yet necessary cooling . on",
    "the other hand one realizes from fig . 3b",
    "that depending on the bag parameter employed there might be ( moderate to strong ) cooling in the one and reheating in the other case .",
    "in all the numerous and recent studies within thermal hadronic models one tries to find common parameters of the fireball by trying to fit the ratios of measured hadronic abundancies within a few parameters . within the above model of a rapidly disintegrating qgp we had repeated these kind of analysis @xcite and were forced to assume a high bag constant of @xmath38 mev in order to find a similar good agreement like earlier investigations .",
    "then , according to the model , no real cooling would emerge during the phase transition and thus also no strangelet may condense",
    ". the temperature will drop , if the specific entropy per baryon in the hadron phase exceeds that in the quark phase , @xmath39 , otherwise the temperature has to slightly increase during the transition @xcite .",
    "the first is the case ( within the model ) when the bag constant @xmath40 is small or moderate and allows for the existence of ( meta-)stable strange quark matter states .",
    "although this intimate connection between cooling of the plasma phase and the existence of strange quark matter is intriguing , it might be valid only within the simple parametrisation of the quark gluon plasma phase within a bag model description .",
    "ultimately , whether @xmath41 is larger or smaller than @xmath42 at finite , nonvanishing chemical potentials might theoretically only be proven rigorously by lattice gauge calculations in the future , as also the principle existence of ( meta-)stable strange quark matter .",
    "more conservative estimates of production of small multistrange objects ( either strangelets or memos ) without the need of a temporarily present intermediate qgp phase are based on coalescence models being put forward by dover and coworkers @xcite .",
    "such estimates yield very small production rates , for instance @xmath43 events per central au+au collisions at 11.7  agev for the lightest bound @xmath9 system @xmath44he .",
    "very simple coalescence estimates give production probabilities of strange clusters of the order of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the strangeness and @xmath47 the baryon number of the cluster . for a maximum sensitivity of @xmath48 only strangelets or memos with baryon numbers of @xmath49 are expected to be seen . as has been seen recently by the e864-collaboration @xcite the penalty factor @xmath50 for an additional unit of baryon number at ags energies in central collisions",
    "is in fact very small , @xmath51 , implying that the formation of exotic objects by coalescence is even less favorable .",
    "4 shows calculated thermal multiplicities of various hypermatter clusters for central pb+pb collisions at sps energies @xcite . these numbers should serve as an upper limit for the production via coalescence .",
    "the ( thermal ) penalty factor suppresses the abundances of heavy clusters : metastable hypermatter can only be produced with a probability @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( e.g. a \\{@xmath54 } object ) .",
    "hence , only exotic objects with very low mass number are expected to be ( possibly ) seen at the ags or at cern .",
    "it is important to note that these objects are a new form of matter , not a specific new particle .",
    "the strange droplets produced in these reactions do not come in the form of a single type of particle .",
    "many different sizes of droplets may be produced , spanning a range in mass , charge , and strangeness content .",
    "the experimental task of finding the new form of matter is therefore challenging . here",
    "any detected particle having an unusual charge to mass ratio is a potential strange matter candidate .    employing tof - techniques in present settings to reveal the velocity and thus the charge to mass ratio",
    ", the experimental setup sets a natural time scale of @xmath55 ns @xcite .",
    "so , an important question we finally have to adress are the lifetimes of these objects . the lifetime of a memo should be similar to the @xmath1 s lifetime , i.e. @xmath56 sec . however , all the present experiments are unable to observe metastable hyperclusters due to the required lifetimes @xmath57s . on the other hand ,",
    "if a produced strangelet is absolutely stable , the only energetically possible decay mode is the rather slow weak leptonic decay ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , which will turn the strangelet to its minimum value in energy .",
    "it is much more likely , if at all , however , that a small strangelet is a weakly decaying metastable state .",
    "the situation turns out to be even more complicated : strangelets will not be in their ground state when being produced in a heavy ion collision .",
    "suppose a strangelet is created out of the hot and dense matter with some arbitrary strangeness , charge and baryon number .",
    "strong interactions and the distillation process will alter the composition of a strangelet by particle evaporation on a timescale of a few hundred fm / c after the collision .",
    "the strangelet , if surviving this , will cool down until it reaches the domain of weak interactions . weak hadronic decay by hadron emission takes place on a timescale being estimated between @xmath60 s. as a conservative quideline one might even also consider the life - time of the @xmath1-particle .",
    "strangelets stable against further strong decay channels but decaying by the weak hadronic decay will be dubbed as short - lived candidates .",
    "strangelets stable against weak hadronic decay will then still be subject to the weak leptonic decay occuring on a timescale of @xmath61 s. they are dubbed as long - lived candidates .",
    "obviously , the present experiments are probably only capable to look for the long - lived candidates .    following the qualitative and old ideas of chin and kerman @xcite , we had carried out a detailed analysis for small short - lived and long - lived strangelet candidates @xcite , where shell effects are quite pronounced and immportant .",
    "one qualitative outcome is that all candiates are likely to be negative , especially the long - lived candiadates . at first sight",
    "this might appear counter - intuitive .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that strong nucleon decay will drive a strangelet to a higher net strangeness content @xmath62 and carries away positive charge .",
    "consider a system of bulk sqm in the ground - state with a finite total strangeness of e.g. @xmath63 ( compare fig . 1",
    ", @xmath64 mev ) . one",
    "would now naively argue that strange quark matter with @xmath65=0.4 is the ground - state of the system , because the energy per baryon of this state is lower than that of the hyperonic state .",
    "however , the total energy per baryon can be lowered by additional @xmath6650 mev by assembling the non - strange quarks into pure nucleonic degrees of freedom ( i.e. ` @xmath67-particle or nucleon emission ' ) , leaving the strange quarks in a strange matter droplet , its strangeness fraction enriched to @xmath68 slightly _ above _ its minimum value .",
    "this strong nucleon decay will stop to happen for energetical reasons at the so called tangent point ( compare fig.1 ) .",
    "finite size corrections , i.e. strong shell effects , on the other side , of course , will change this picture quantitatively .",
    "a similar reasoning shows that the weak nucleon decay again will change the candidates to become even more negative .",
    "5 shows the result of this investigation for long - lived candidates which are stable against weak hadronic decay modes @xcite .",
    "different bag parameters have been chosen in order to get some feeling for the different possibilities . besides the _",
    "neutral _ so called quark - alpha state @xcite with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) a valley of stability appears at @xmath71 for long - lived , negative candidates . for bag parameters of @xmath72 mev",
    "no long - lived candidates have been found at all .",
    "still there exist a much richer spectrum of shortlived strangelets or memos with a lifetime of the order of the @xmath1 or somewhat below @xcite .",
    "it might well be that only metastable strange clusters with @xmath66 cm flight path seem to have a chance of being created .",
    "future experiments geared to proof the ( non)existence of strangelets therefore should clearly cover such short lifetimes .",
    "an open geometry detectional device will be needed , which clearly is a challenging task due to the large background of charged hadrons at the target in violent events with high multiplicities .",
    "originally ( strange ) quark matter in bulk was thought to exist only in the interiour of neutron stars where the pressure is high enough that the neutron matter melts into its quark substructure @xcite . at least in the cores of neutron stars ( where the density rises up to the order of @xmath73 times normal nuclear density )",
    "it is not very likely that matter consists of individual hadrons .",
    "on the other hand it is also known that the pure ` neutron ' matter is not really a nuclear matter state made solely out of neutrons , but at least at higher densities consists also of a considerable amount of protons as well as hyperons .",
    "indeed , it was shown by glendenning that hyperons @xcite appear at a moderate density of about @xmath74 times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "these new species influence the properties of the equation of state of matter and the global properties of neutron stars",
    ". there may be so many hyperons in the neutron star that the whole object is more appropriately dubbed a giant hypernucleus .",
    "the gross structure of a neutron star like its mass m and radius r is influenced by the composition of its stellar material .",
    "this holds especially in the case of the existence of strangeness bearing `` exotic '' components like hyperons or strange quark matter which may significantly change the characteristic mass - radius ( mr ) relation of the star . for example",
    "hyperons considerably soften the eos and reduce the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "@xmath75    besides the speculative possibility of nearly pure sqm stars , which would be the case , if sqm is absolutely stable in bulk , it is more likely that in the interiour of the star a phase transition to hadronic matter will take place .",
    "the ` neutron ' star would then have the form of a so called hybrid star , i.e. a star which is made of baryonic matter in the outer region , but with a quark matter core in the deep interiour .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to the sqm phase is constructed according to the requirement of global charge neutrality between both phases @xcite .",
    "the pressure of both phases spans up a two dimensional surface over the plane of the relevant chemical potentials of the baryons ( @xmath76 ) and the electrons ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "one finds that the pressure varies smoothly and continuously with the proportion of both phases in equilibrium , which , in turn will lead to a mixed phase of finite radial extent ( of several kilometers ) inside the star @xcite .",
    "7 shows the resulting mr relations for various situations and qcd coupling constants @xmath78 employed within the effective mass bag model discussed in @xcite .",
    "the left hand side ( @xmath79 ) shows the pure sqm star results , which turn out to be rather compact objects .",
    "the situation changes completely for the hybrid stars , depicted on the right hand side of fig.[rm1 ] ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "their mr relation approaches the curve of the pure hadron star ( denoted by h ) if the phase transition occurs deep insight the star .",
    "accordingly it will be difficult to judge from measured properties of pulsars to really disentangle the possible interiour structure of neutron stars. for possible consequences which might be observable , like e.g. timing structure of pulsar spin - down , higher spin rates , or stronger cooling rates , especially relevant for young neutron stars , we want to refer to @xcite .",
    "witten raised the intriguing possibility that strange quark matter might in principle also be absolutely stable and may also provide an explanation for cold ( baryonic ) dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "if being stable and nearly neutral , it could exist at all possible sizes @xcite , as the small coulomb energy is not sufficient for a break up into smaller pieces @xcite .",
    "it might thus span as a charge neutral state the empty ` nuclear desert ' @xcite within the range from @xmath81 up to sizes of neutron stars @xmath82 .    in witten s prospective scenario",
    "hot strange quark matter nuggets could have condensed out of the deconfined phase during the phase transition in the expanding and cooling early universe @xcite .",
    "these would carry most of the tiny surplus in baryon number of the whole universe . the baryon number would remain inside if the heat and entropy of the nugetts is carried away mainly by neutrino emission instead of mesons and especially baryons .",
    "if an absolutely stable groundstate would exist the hot nuggets would further cool and instead of suffering a complete hadronisation they might settle into these new states and hence could resolve the dark matter problem .",
    "since then the idea of absolute stability has stimulated a lot of work on potential consequences in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "today it is fair to say that there is still no real evidence for absolutely stable sqm to be a possible dark matter candiate .",
    "there had been early conjectures @xcite that escpecially smaller glumps of sqm could not have survived the ongoing and still hot epoch of the cosmological evolution , but would have in fact been completely evaporated into single hadrons .",
    "hence , particle physicists were led to look for other possible ( and maybe even more exotic ) explanations on the issue of dark matter . on the other side , in a very recent ( and speculative ) study @xcite",
    "the issue of stable quark matter was taken up again .",
    "there it is speculated that a ( stable ) pre quark - matter phase might in fact also explain the formation of galaxies clusters , the formation of massive black holes in the galactic centres , and also might be a source of the @xmath83-ray bursts .",
