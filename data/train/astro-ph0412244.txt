    "the detection of quasars at @xmath4 ( becker et al . 2002 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; hu et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests that the intergalactic medium is highly ionized by @xmath5 and therefore reionization began at redshifts @xmath6 due to uv emitting source other than quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "quasars are not considered to be such sources because their comoving number density decreases rapidly at @xmath7 ( shapiro & giroux 1987 ; madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) . by virtue of the wmap results ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) an era of reionization is associated with the epoch of early star formation at @xmath8 .",
    "the number of massive popiii stars forming then produces sufficient uv photons to at least partially ionize the igm ( barkana & loeb 2001 , 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , the discovery of a large number of lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) ( steidel et al .",
    "2003 ) at redshifts ( @xmath9 ) could also explain the completion of reionization by @xmath10 due to the population of proto - galaxies that form earlier ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in that case , massive galactic type stars , which are abundant at @xmath6 ( madau et al .",
    "1999 ) , would be the ionizing sources of a galaxy - dominated uv background ( haenhelt et al .",
    "simulations can be `` fine - tuned '' to describe one or the other scenario ( razoumov et al . 2001 ; giardi et al .",
    "2003 ; sokasian et al .",
    "2003 ) . regardless of whether such results will become",
    "the standard accepted theory in the study of reionization one conclusion has gained substantial confidence .",
    "hydrogen reionization was most likely caused by a soft , stellar type uv radiation field with a large softness index ( @xmath12 ) between redshifts @xmath13 .",
    "the large optical depth due to electron scattering detected by the wmap places the beginning of reionization much earlier than the highest redshift ly@xmath2 emitter ( sdss 1148 + 5251 ) detected to date in ground based observations at @xmath14 ( hu et al .",
    "if the universe was permanently globally reionized after @xmath15 then the ly@xmath2 opacity evolution is expected to be smooth down to small redshifts ( songaila 2004 ) .",
    "however , lyman-@xmath2 forest observations in the spectrum of sdss  1030 + 0524 ( z=6.28 ) shows an optical depth trough at @xmath16 ( becker et al .",
    "2002 , songaila & cowie 2002 ; fan et al .",
    "the lack of transmitted flux has been interpreted as the detection of the reionization tail .",
    "however , songaila ( 2004 ) has shown that the previous conclusion was based on an incorrect conversion of ly@xmath17 opacities to ly@xmath2 opacities .",
    "the correct conversions show a smooth evolution of the optical depth up to @xmath18 .",
    "this suggests that the trough in the sdss  1030 + 0524 spectrum might be a dark gap occurrence due to the large variance in absorption at high redshifts , although it is not clear whether the line of sight variance ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) or the cosmic variance ( songaila 2004 ) is responsible .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution the mean transmitted flux and flux variance using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the ly@xmath2 forest in a concordance @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "we adopt a picture of hydrogen reionization that begins at @xmath19 due to the galactic radiative feedback and is rapidly completed by @xmath20 .",
    "that does not exclude the possibility of recurring reionization events prior to @xmath19 but does exclude a single reionization instance at @xmath21 . in our picture",
    ", the transmitted ly@xmath2 flux evolves smoothly from small redshifts up to @xmath22 which is consistent with the songaila ( 2004 ) result . knowing the exact moment and shape of reionization in our simulation allows the investigation of the statistical properties of the ly@xmath2 transmission using synthetic spectra even within the reionization tail .",
    "we find that , although the mean transmitted flux deviates from the extrapolated smooth evolution as it enters the reionization tail , the large scatter in the transmitted flux from one line of sight to another makes it a poor indicator of reionization .",
    "an observation could miss the reionization tail or underestimate the redshift at which the tail begins .",
    "instead we propose that the line of sight variance be used for tracing the reionization tail because it shows a larger sensitivity to the hydrogen opacity .",
    "we have performed a @xmath0cdm hydro - cosmological simulation using our eulerian code enzo ( bryan & norman 1997 ; norman & bryan 1998 ; bryan et al . 1999 ) with @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 kms@xmath26 ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the primordial distribution of gas and dark matter was initialized in a comoving box of @xmath29 mpc using the linear power spectrum from eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) with @xmath30 .",
    "the cosmic , hydrodynamic and ionization evolution of the igm was then computed from z=99 to z=2.0 .",
    "enzo solves the coupled system of the multispecies , fluid , self - gravity and ionization equations on an eulerian comoving grid for the redshift evolution of the 3d distribution of the gas variables ( e.g. temperature , density etc . ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath31 collisionless cold dark matter particles is also computed at every time - step and is used to calculate the large - scale gravitational field in the box .",
    "the grid resolution of @xmath31 cells gives our simulation box a comoving spatial resolution of @xmath32 kpc .",
    "bryan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that in order to resolve the ly@xmath2 forest in a numerical simulation one needs at least 40 kpc spatial resolution . for our choice of the hubble constant and box size ,",
    "we resolve comoving scales of  37 kpc per grid cell .",
    "enzo uses a volume averaged uv background that evolves with redshift and photo - ionizes the primary cosmic chemical elements ( h & he ) . until recently , enzo used the mean intensity spectrum computed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) ( hm96 ) which was based on quasar counts alone .",
    "such a spectrum is insufficient to describe the ionization and thermal state of the igm at redshifts @xmath33 .",
    "our current understanding of hydrogen re - ionization places the onset of re - ionization at redshifts @xmath34 where quasar counts alone can not provide the needed flux for the igm to ionize .",
    "one possible source for the missing flux is the population of dwarf - galaxies , which form in shallow gravity wells between @xmath35 and contribute to a soft , stellar uv background .",
    "the other possible source for the ionizing flux due to popiii objects at redshifts @xmath36 is not addressed in this paper .",
    "haardt & madau ( 2001 ) ( hm01 ) have computed the redshift evolution of the volume averaged uv intensity which takes into account the evolving populations of both galaxies and qsos .",
    "we have incorporated into enzo this radiation background in the form of the frequency - integrated photo - ionization rates , @xmath37 , and photo - heating rates , @xmath38 . in our notation , i indicates the chemical species ( i = hi , hei , heii ) , @xmath39 the species ionization frequency , @xmath40 the ionization cross section and @xmath41 the mean intensity frequency distribution at redshift z. the photo - ionization and photo - heating rates are used to update the local chemical abundances and local gas energy respectively . in figures  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 )",
    "we show parametric fits to the redshift evolution of the species photo - ionization and photo - heating rates . at redshifts",
    "@xmath42 we note the effect that the galactic contribution has on the uv flux .",
    "the qso contribution diminishes rapidly at @xmath43 due to the decrease of their comoving number density .",
    "however , the galactic component , which peaks around @xmath44 , provides enough ionizing flux to at least ionize hi and hei ( the softness of the stellar radiation makes it a poor ionizer of heii which requires a harder spectrum ) .",
    "a self - consistent calculation will compute the 3d propagation and percolation of the ionization fronts ( i - fronts ) emanating from the uv production regions ( shapiro & giroux 1987 ; abel & haehnelt 1999 ; gnedin 2000 ; razoumov et al .",
    "2002 ; giardi et al .",
    "2003 ; sokasian et al .",
    "2003 ) . in that scheme , reionization begins when the individual i - fronts begin to merge and is completed when the volume filling factor of ionized matter is @xmath45 .",
    "prior to the merging , regions of fully neutral hydrogen in the space between the i - fronts have large column densities and therefore large optical depths .",
    "quantitatively , a comoving stencil ( @xmath46 ) of neutral hydrogen at the cosmic mean gas density will have a column density of @xmath47 @xmath48 . at z=7 and for @xmath49 kpc , the spatial scale that resolves the ly@xmath2 forest ( bryan et al .",
    "1999 ) , we get @xmath50 @xmath48 which corresponds to @xmath51 . despite this seemingly large continuum optical depth the i - fronts will eventually burn through as the number density of the ionizing sources increases and the volume is rarefied by cosmic expansion and structure formation . since most of the volume is at overdensities below the cosmic - mean the i - fronts are rapidly propagating in underdense regions while slowly ionizing denser clumps of neutral material .",
    "this mechanism of reionization accelerates as the i - fronts merge because at that point two or more uv sources can ionize the same region of space .",
    "this accelerated pace is illustrated in the steep decrease within a very short time ( @xmath52 or 25 - 40 myrs ) of the gunn - peterson optical depth computed by razoumov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the study of reionization using a rising uniform uv background , which is applied at every point in the cosmic volume , lacks the mechanism of percolating i - fronts and therefore _ can not _ self - consistently simulate the effect of reionization via the merging of ionized regions . in order to proceed",
    "we need to closely emulate the current understanding of _ reionization mechanics _ in our numerical setup .",
    "first , we need to choose the redshift at which reionization begins which corresponds to the phase of initial merging of the i - fronts . at that point , we initialize our background uv field to a tiny value .",
    "this approach is not far from reality because , despite the presence of bubbles filled with uv - radiation in the volume , most of the hydrogen mass is not yet ionized .",
    "the effect of our initialization is to begin to ionize the most underdense regions with a value for the photo - ionization rate that does not yet have an effect on higher density regions .",
    "the last claim is based on the fact that higher gas densities will have smaller recombination time - scales than lower gas densities and therefore achieve ionization equilibrium faster .",
    "the underdense regions on the other hand may never achieve ionization equilibrium and therefore their state of ionization is effectively determined by the ionization time - scale ( @xmath53 myrs between z=7 - 6 ) .",
    "ignoring the effects of recombination for small overdensities allows for a simplified estimate of the time required for a fixed volume element @xmath54 to be fully ionized .",
    "this is determined by the balance between the number of ionizing photons per unit time and the available targets per unit volume to be ionized @xmath55 .",
    "the last expression suggests that for a uniform ionization rate the most underdense regions photo - ionize first .",
    "this bottom - up ionization mechanism emulates the preferred i - front propagation channel which is the expansion into the underdense igm .",
    "our second free parameter is the choice for the time - scale at which we would need to ramp - up the ionization ( and heating ) rates to a volume averaged values that is physically valid in the cosmic medium at high redshifts . in reality",
    ", the ramping of the volume - averaged rates is expected due to the rapid increase of the uv - radiation volume - filling factor as the i - fronts merge .",
    "in addition , as the cosmic volume becomes transparent to more sources of radiation photo - ionization of the igm accelerates . since the current highest - redshift ly@xmath2 emitter lies at z=6.56 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) our choice for the onset of reionization needs to be @xmath56 .",
    "we adopt the conclusions from the galactic ionization model by razoumov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and set @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , we ramp the ionization rates to the hm01 values by @xmath58 using an analytic ramp function with a skin - width of @xmath59 .    choosing an earlier initialization redshift for the ionizing background does not have any measurable effect on the opacity of the igm at @xmath60 .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .  3 where we compute the redshift dependence of the gunn - peterson optical depth ( peebles 1965 ) @xmath61 for five cases using a lower grid resolution simulation ( @xmath62 grid cells ) of the same box size and substituting for the @xmath63 the mean hi neutral fraction in the volume .",
    "our first case ( a0 ) uses the qso - only hm96 spectrum where we extrapolate the fit to the rates beyond z=5.0 in order to initialize the radiation field at @xmath64 .",
    "the cases a through d correspond to the hm01 spectrum and use the ionization rates from figure  ( 1 ) .",
    "they differ only in the choice for the redshift of the reionization onset .",
    "our redshift of interest lies at @xmath65 where there are current observations . henceforth , we find no difference in the optical depth evolution between the four models in that redshift range .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath64 for consistency with other theoretical and numerical models .",
    "due to our limited box size , we terminate our calculation at z=2 . however , since our focus is the high redshift ly@xmath2 forest , that our computational box contains enough mass power at these redshifts to make it a representative cosmic realization .",
    "a recently completed simulation of a  54@xmath66 mpc cosmology box with a grid resolution of @xmath67 grid cells and @xmath67 dark matter particles will address the lack of matter power at large scales .",
    "we plan to repeat this work for that simulation in order to determine if the deficiencies of the current simulation has an effect on our conclusions .",
    "the method for generating synthetic spectra of the ly@xmath2 forest is described in zhang et al .",
    "1997 , bryan et al .",
    "1999 and machacek et al . 2000 .",
    "we begin the spectrum calculation by selecting a point in the volume from which we cast random lines of sight . along a line of sight ( los )",
    "we integrate the optical depth of the redshifted ly@xmath2 photons that are scattered at the rest frame of reference of an absorbing grid cell .",
    "the optical depth is given by equation  ( 1 ) ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) , where @xmath2 is the cosmic scale factor and the integration limits are between the redshift of the initial point ( equal to the redshift of the simulation dump ) and the redshift at which we wish to measure the ly-@xmath2 absorption .",

    "@xmath71 is the local thermal speed and @xmath72 is the local proper number ion density .",
    "the projected velocity along the los at the local cell , @xmath73 , is the sum of the projected peculiar velocity plus the hubble expansion speed .",
    "the input fields used to generate the synthetic spectra are the grid distributions of gas temperature , the three components of the gas peculiar velocities and the ion proper density .",
    "our redshift integration range is @xmath74 which corresponds to the frequency of the simulation dumps .",
    "the optical depth integration assumes that the input fields do not have any comoving evolution between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "each line of sight is continuous through redshift space . at the end of integration we store the position of the last absorbing cell and the direction of the ray and",
    "use them at the beginning of the integration step through the next simulation dump .",
    "the size of our simulation box is smaller than the distance traveled by the ly@xmath2 photons in @xmath74 for all redshifts @xmath77 .",
    "therefore each los exits and re - enters the periodic computation box several times before the integration step is completed .",
    "the number of exits and re - entries depends on the redshift due to the volume s proper size increase with cosmic time . for more details on the subject we refer to zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the transmitted flux at every redshift point is simply @xmath78 .",
    "we call the arithmetic mean of the transmitted flux along a los in a redshift bin [ z , z-@xmath79 the mean value @xmath80 at @xmath81",
    ". the los effective optical depth at @xmath82 is then defined by @xmath83 .",
    "following gaztanaga & croft ( 1999 ) , we define the los flux variance , the variance along a line of sight , through @xmath84 .",
    "the normalization by the mean flux is in analogy to normalizing the density fluctuations to the mean density .",
    "the mean los - variance ( mlv ) is then equal to @xmath85 .",
    "the mean values from all lines of sight constitute a population of random samples distributed about the expected value of the mean transmitted flux at that redshift .",

    ". the unbiased variance of the mtf at redshift @xmath87 is computed by @xmath88 , where we follow the same definition convention as with a single line of sight .",
    "finally we define the total mtf - variance ( tmv ) as the product @xmath89 ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "a total of 75 random lines of sight were computed from z=6.6 to z=2 .",

    "each integration redshift bin of @xmath92 was resolved by 30000 points which results in a maximum redshift resolution of @xmath93 .",
    "our spectral resolution then becomes a function of redshift , @xmath94 where @xmath87 is the mean of the redshift interval .",
    "three resolutions are then considered in the present work .",
    "the full resolution case ( fres ) uses our raw synthetic spectra . a high resolution ( hres )",

    "appear in the ly@xmath2 forest that , as we shall show , are underionized high opacity overdensities .",
    "the size of the dark gaps increases between @xmath107 and @xmath108 as the smaller gaps at lower redshifts merge and the amplitude of the high transmission region decreases .      in figure",

    "the smoothness of @xmath112 persists in our calculation up to @xmath113 which is consistent with the conclusion by songaila ( 2004 ) .",
    "the solid red line through the red crosses is a power law least squares fit between @xmath114 .",
    "the last red cross in figure  ( 6 ) lies well within the reionization tail and was not included in the fit : @xmath115 the cosmic parameters in our simulation were chosen in order to match low redshift observations and indeed the match with observed data at @xmath116 is good .",
    "the blue lines in figure  ( 7 ) are a measure of the scatter of the los mean transmitted flux .",
    "they correspond to the minimum and maximum los mean values ( converted to optical depths ) in each redshift interval . within the los scatter range we are in decent agreement with the observed values across the entire redshift space .",
    "the solid lines in figure  ( 6 ) correspond to the full resolution of our synthetic spectra ( fres ) .",
    "the spectral resolution does not have an effect on the mean flux value in a redshift interval but it does alter the scatter of the data about the mean .",
    "low resolution spectra will have smaller scatter about the mean as is illustrated by the dashed blue lines in figure  ( 6 ) where we plot the los scattering in the lres case for @xmath99 .",

    "however , the use of equation  ( 3 ) instead of equation  ( 2 ) allows for the determination of the normalized ionization rate from the synthetic spectra perspective .",
    "the solid line on the right panel of figure  ( 7 ) is the normalized ionization rate as inferred from the power law assumption in equation  ( 3 ) . the effect that the @xmath128 deviation of the scaling factor @xmath120 , has on the ionization rate fit",
    "is shown as small dashed lines .",

    "the latter accounts for a clumpy baryon distribution but not for the relative difference between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "we compensate for that by adjusting the normalized rate rather than the functional form of equation  ( 3 ) .",
    "the result is shown as a thick dashed line on the right panel of figure  ( 7 ) . the mean absolute deviation between the raw simulation data and the power law fit ( spectra )",
    "is then improved from @xmath137% to @xmath138% .",
    "nonetheless , the shape of the input ionization rate still does not conform to that of a power law .",
    "the fits we considered to analytically represent the mean flux evolution at @xmath7 do not include the last point at @xmath139 which is located above the fit - curves in figure  ( 6 ) and figure  ( 7 ) .",

    "those two points lie either inside or too close to the reionization tail which in our setup is located at redshifts @xmath141 . to better relate observables to the underlying physical properties we show on the top - left panel of figure  ( 8) the profile of reionization , as is traced by the mean baryon fraction in neutral hydrogen ( @xmath142 ) between z=5 - 7 .",

    "overplotted are the margins of error to the mtf at two confidence levels ( cl ) ( bars : cl=68% open : cl=90% ) .",
    "the margins of error were determined by the distribution of the los mean fluxes at each redshift bin and they systematically increase with redshift for a fixed number of lines of sight .",
    "this is due to the increase with redshift of the los - variance which is used to compute the margin of error .",
    "the los - variance dependence on redshift is expected because it is effectively determined by the cosmic variance which increases as neutral hydrogen becomes more abundant .",
    "small values of cosmic variance will yield mean fluxes along a set of lines of sight that are closely clustered about the los - averaged transmitted flux and therefore returning a small value for the los - variance . on the other hand , mean fluxes computed along a set of lines of sight would be widely spread ( large los - variance ) if the cosmic variance at that redshift has a large value .",
    "the margin of error determines whether a particular mean transmitted flux value statistically deviates from a smooth evolution or not .",
    "the mtf value in the redshift interval z=6.28 - 6.44 can not be used to conclude a deviation from a smooth evolution because the upper error margin ( at both confidence levels ) includes the extrapolated curve from lower redshifts . that particular redshift interval should be statistically excluded from being in the reionization tail even though it samples the last 1% of it . however , this conclusion is based upon the available number of lines of sight since the margin of error scales as @xmath157 .",
    "it is highly unlikely though that near future observations at high redshift will exceed 75 ly@xmath2 transmission lines .",
    "if we consider fewer lines of sight then the increased margin of error will only solidify our conclusion about the particular redshift interval .",
    "therefore , transmitted flux values recorded close to the end of reionization give no `` statistical '' indication of sampling the tail despite the high probability that an individual transmitted flux value may lie well beneath the smooth evolution curve .",
    "the transmitted flux values measured in the redshift interval z=6.44 - 6.60 are located well within the reionization tail .",
    "they in fact sample most of reionization s completion level curve .",
    "the mean transmitted flux is 0.95 dex below the extrapolated power law of equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "the upper error bar at cl=90% is also below the power law curve by 0.55 dex which statistically places that redshift interval within reionization .",
    "however , there is a non - zero probability that a single line of sight would yield a value for the transmitted flux above @xmath158 where @xmath159 from equation  ( 2 ) . that probability depends on the extent of the redshift interval in which the los - spectra are sampled .",
    "the larger the extent the more low transmission pixels are included from higher redshifts and therefore the probability of a high transmission pixel becomes smaller .",
    "for @xmath160 the probability that a line of sight would yield a mean flux value more than @xmath161 is @xmath162% .",
    "if instead we resolve the last redshift interval with four bins of @xmath163 then p=[0.2,0.08,0.01,0.001 ] in each of the intervals [ 6.44 - 6.48],[6.48 - 6.52],[6.52 - 6.56 ] & [ 6.56 - 6.60 ] respectively .",
    "the mean redshift in each bin corresponds to rcp values of rcp=[0.97,0.90,0.70,0.28 ] which suggests that the probability of a single line of sight missing the last 10% of the reionization epoch is more than 8% .",
    "although this number is relatively small and model dependent it illustrates the importance of variance when synthesizing or observing spectra in proximity to or within the reionization tail .",
    "the right - bottom panel shows the evolution of the tmv - variance ( solid line ) and mlv - variance ( dashed : fres dashed - dot : lres ) .",
    "we note that the lres variance is smaller when compared to the fres case as expected .",
    "the tmv - variance is the same in all cases since the mean flux is not affected by the spectral resolution .",
    "the data were fitted to linear - log profiles for @xmath164 which are overplotted in the figure .",
    "all types of variance show a break from a linear - log profile for @xmath165 which is earlier ( time moves backward in this picture ) than the corresponding break of the mtf from it s fit .",
    "however all cases remain within @xmath128 from their lower - redshift fit curves up to @xmath166 . in the following section , we examine more closely the difference between the two types of variance we defined and their significance in mapping reionization .      in section  ( 2 )",
    "we defined the mtf - variance as the measure of dispersion of the los - mean flux values in each redshift bin about the mean transmitted flux ( mtf ) .",
    "in addition , we defined the mlv - variance as the los - average of the variances along individual lines of sight .",
    "we plot in figure  ( 9 ) the total mtf - variance @xmath167 and mlv - variance against redshift from z=2.5 - 6.6 . the black triangles show the tmv - data while the dashed and dot - dashed lines connect the mlv - data for the fres and lres cases respectively .",
    "we find only a very small difference between fres and hres cases at @xmath168 , therefore only the last one is shown in that range .",
    "overplotted as color - points are the variance values from the individual lines of sight ( green : fres ; blue : hres ; red : lres ) which are scattered about their respective mlv lines . across the redshift range z=2.5 - 5.8 ,",
    "a linear - log least squares fit in the form @xmath169 , matches our variance data from figure  ( 9 ) with better than 5% mean absolute deviation .",
    "the constants @xmath170 and @xmath171 depend on the resolution and the type of variance and are given in table - i .",
    "the redshift point z=5.8 was selected visually because of an apparent break of the tmv - data from a straight line there ( solid line in figure  ( 8)-bottom left panel ) .",
    "however , only data at @xmath172 have variance values @xmath173 .",
    "this redshift value matches the point of departure from a smooth profile of the mtf evolution shown in figure  ( 8) ( bottom right panel ) and corresponds to the redshift interval ( @xmath174 ) which samples the very last stages of reionization .",
    "it is however , the simultaneous significant break from a smooth profile of both the mean flux and variance that a large enough margin of error is introduced to the mtf to infer a possible continuation of a smooth evolution through that redshift interval .",
    "the steep increase of the transmitted flux variance as we cross into the reionization phase is expected because the variance at each redshift is equal to the total transmitted flux power ( tytler et al .",
    "1997 ) . in turn",
    "the total transmitted flux power is proportional to the total mass power of neutral hydrogen which decreases rapidly as reionization takes place .",
    "our computation volume is limited in that respect because the largest length scale it simulates , ( smallest wave - number ) corresponds to the box size of 6.816@xmath66 mpc .",
    "larger length scales can be sampled by wrapping a synthetic line of sight through the simulated volume .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the cosmic volume is an ensemble of such volumes .",
    "however , in doing so there is no additional gain in flux power . in this section",
    "we attempt a description of the flux variance cosmic evolution which within the limitations of the present simulation is a lower bound estimate .",
    "a redshift profile with the functional form @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) can be inferred from theory ( appendix ii ) for the transmitted flux variance .",
    "this equation was derived by computing the second moment of the local transmission over the volume distribution of densities following songaila and cowie ( 2002 ) and it should generally be valid in the post - reionization era ( z=4 - 6.25 ) where equation  ( 3 ) f(g , z ) also fits our optical depth data . in the range of @xmath177 the constant @xmath178 ( appendix ii ) . using the discrete los variance values in the fres case from figure  ( 9 ) we can estimate that between @xmath179 to @xmath180 the ratio @xmath181 scales between 16.6 - 25.7 .",
    "this range compares well with the one inferred from @xmath182 for @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively . in the last approximation",
    ", the values of @xmath185 were obtained from the equation  ( 3 ) fits to our data ( figure  ( 7)-left panel ) .",
    "the validity of the analytic expression does not however suggest a deterministic dependence of the variance to the mean transmitted flux but rather reflects that both quantities are correlated through their dependence on the mean igm opacity .",
    "both the mtf - variance and the mean los - variance are measures of the `` cosmic variance '' from two different perspectives .",
    "the mtf - variance measures the normalized dispersion of a random sample of los - mean fluxes .",
    "mlv in our setup measures the mean value of a random sample of normalized los - variances .",
    "statistically the mean value @xmath186 of a sample of random values @xmath187 drawn from a larger population is a point - estimate of the population mean @xmath188 . on the other hand ,",
    "the variance of n random means @xmath189 underestimates the variance to the population mean by a factor n. thus , we multiply the computed mtf - variance by nlos ( number of lines of sight ) to recover the total mtf variance ( tmv ) which is an estimate of the cosmic flux variance .",
    "figure  ( 9 ) shows that for redshifts @xmath190 both types of variance have values within the scatter of the individual los data ( points ) .",
    "the comparison also shows that only the fres / hres mlv - data can be related to the total mtf - variance results which are not sensitive to resolution .    despite both variance types scaling in a similar manner with redshift , they are not equal because of the different normalization and therefore a unique measurement of the cosmic variance of the transmitted flux",
    "can not be derived from either of them . to directly compare one type of variance to the other , we are required to revert to the standard ( un - normalized ) variance definition .",
    "the standard total mtf variance is equal to @xmath191 .",
    "the standard mean los - variance is similarly equal to @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the mean flux along a line of sight j. is used in literature to describe the linear mass variance . here",
    "the notation stands for the weighted mean of the variances along lines of sight .",
    "] in theory , if the individual los - mean fluxes ( @xmath193 ) are independent random measurements then @xmath194 ( appendix iii ) .    on the top left panel of figure  ( 10 )",
    "we plot @xmath195 and @xmath196 in the redshift range z=2.5 - 6.6 .",
    "the first quantity is tmv from figure  ( 9 ) ( triangles ) .",
    "the second quantity is the renormalized mlv - variance in the fres case ( dashed - line ) .",
    "parametric fits to the data following a linear - log profile are provided in table - i , which shows that the @xmath197 of the fits increases if we include values up to @xmath198 compared to the fits obtained from @xmath164 .",
    "nonetheless , the curves only break away from a linear - log profile above the @xmath128 scatter of the fits upon crossing into the reionization phase in the redshift interval [ 6.28 - 6.44 ] .",
    "the value for the variance increases by @xmath199dex between @xmath200 .",
    "the decrease in the mtf ( ignoring errors ) is @xmath201dex in the same @xmath87 range .",
    "this difference in the degree of change of the two quantities ( mean flux and flux variance ) within the reionization tail has a significant implication .",
    "the baryon mass in our computation box has a mean value equal to the cosmic mean and therefore we do not expect the calculation of the mtf to be appreciably biased by the finite volume . however , as discussed previously , our calculation of the flux variance in our finite volume , yields at best a lower - bound estimate .",
    "this implies that a bigger computation volume or line of sight observation , which would better sample the mass power spectrum at large scales , would in turn yield a larger flux - variance and a bigger degree of change within the reionization tail .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the difference in the degree of change within the reionization tail between the mean flux and flux variance would be generally larger than the 0.6 dex we measured in this work .",
    "this suggests that the flux variance exhibits a greater sensitivity to the evolution of the hi distribution than the mean flux does and it could be used instead of the latter in mapping reionization .    the above conclusion is based upon the assumption that both types of variances we defined are estimates of the cosmic variance of the transmitted flux in our synthetic ly@xmath2 spectra .",
    "however , the validity of such an assumption depends on whether the two estimates agree with one another .",
    "the logarithmic y - axis on the top - left panel of figure  ( 10 ) might mask any significant differences between the two quantities .",
    "we address this by plotting the ratio between @xmath202 and @xmath203 , each normalized to the square of the mean transmitted flux , in the redshift range z=2.5 - 6.6 ( top - left panel of figure  ( 10 ) : squares ) . for comparison",
    ", we overplot ( triangles ) the ratio where we substitute in the denominator the mean los - variance ( @xmath204 ) .",

    ", @xmath204 agrees with @xmath205 up to @xmath206 . at redshifts",
    "@xmath207 the mean los - variance consistently yields smaller values than the weighted by the ratio @xmath208 average los - variance .",
    "the difference can be explained by the fact that @xmath204 is a straightforward arithmetic average of the individual normalized variances along each line of sight . at redshifts close to reionization",
    "high transmission regions become rare .",
    "most lines of sight in fact do not include high transmission regions in the last redshift interval ( z=6.44 - 6.62 ) .",
    "therefore , at redshifts close to reionization , the arithmetic mean of variances will be biased by the large number of small flux variance spectra along lines of sight which do not include high transmission regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the weighted average los - variance is dominated by the few high transmission regions , as we will explain in the section  ( 5 ) , and therefore it yields a larger value . at redshifts",
    "@xmath209 the mean los - variance and weighted average los - variance have approximately the same ratio to the mean transmitted flux variance .",
    "this is not unexpected despite the different normalization .",
    "small values for the individual los - variances ( at low to medium redshifts ) suggest that the individual los - mean fluxes are less scattered about the corresponding mtf value . therefore , if @xmath210 ( j=1,nlos ) then @xmath211 .    finally , it is important that one samples the cosmic ly@xmath2 transmission with a statistically adequate number of lines of sight .",
    "any random sample introduces a margin of error which becomes important to minimize at high redshifts where the cosmic variance is large .",
    "small number of lines of sight will retain the skewness of the original population of transmission values but as long as the distribution is highly peaked then the global average of mean fluxes can be trusted . for our 75 lines of sight , equal to the number of mean fluxes per redshift interval , we compute the redshift evolution of the skewness and kyrtosis of the mean flux sample . following croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) they are defined as @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively . in our notation , @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) , @xmath216 and @xmath217 denotes an arithmetic averaging over all lines of sight .",
    "the results are shown in the lower two panels of figure  ( 10 ) .",
    "we find that the distribution of line of sight mean fluxes per redshift interval has on the average a skewness that fluctuates about zero with redshift and but is consistently positive at redshifts close to reionization ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "the kyrtosis on the other hand consistently decreases with redshift which shows that the distribution of los - mean fluxes becomes flatter .",
    "therefore , if one requires an estimate of the global average of the transmitted flux with a fixed margin of error , a progressively increasing with redshift number of lines of sight is needed in order to compensate for the flattening of the distribution of mean fluxes , which arises from the increasing cosmic variance .    on the left panel of figure  ( 11 ) we plot the margin of error relative to the mtf as it scales with redshift . at the 90% confidence level ( cl )",
    "the margin of error is @xmath218% the mtf value at @xmath219 ( @xmath220% at cl=68% ) and larger than 100% at @xmath221 for both confidence levels .",
    "this shows that 75 lines of sight undersamples the distribution of mean fluxes at high redshifts . in distributions with significant skewness",
    "the margin of error is different for the two ends .",
    "the margin of error reported in figure  ( 11 ) for those cases is the average margin of error between the two tail ends .",
    "if we assume that the los - mean flux measurements are normally distributed at all redshifts then we can estimate the los number required to determine the margin of error within 10% of the mtf . for our simulated cosmic volume we would need 1200 lines of sight for the mtf to be computed within 10% ( cl=90% ) at @xmath222 . at cl=68%",
    "the required number of lines of sight drops to about 600 at @xmath222 .",
    "the acquisition of a few hundred high redshift ly@xmath2 observations is currently unattainable and therefore the large margins of errors due to small size samples are unavoidable .",
    "the distribution of los - means at high redshifts is positively skewed because they are derived from the positively skewed transmitted flux distributions along the individual lines of sight .",
    "therefore extreme los - mean fluxes at high redshifts are associated with rare high transmission regions . that in turn results in a few `` large '' los - mean fluxes dominating the mean transmitted flux ( mtf ) .",
    "the few high transmission regions also dominate the variance . if @xmath223 then the mtf - variance is the weighted sum of the individual los - variances ( @xmath224 ) , @xmath225 , where @xmath226 .",
    "if there exists a number of high transmission lines with los - mean fluxes @xmath227 then @xmath228 and therefore the variance calculation would be biased by such lines of sight .    on the top panels of figure  ( 12 )",
    "we plot the transmitted flux ( left panel ) and flux variance ( right panel ) against redshift for @xmath229 while eliminating the statistical contribution of the rare high transmission regions at large redshifts .",
    "we do that by substituting for @xmath230 .",
    "@xmath231 selects the most frequent los - mean transmitted flux value .",
    "@xmath232 denotes the mean flux of line of sight j , at redshift z. the mean fluxes from our 75 lines of sight were binned into 24 optical depth bins from the minimum los - mean flux value ( converted to optical depth ) to the maximum one at each redshift .",
    "the number of lines of sight within each bin were then counted and the mode was computed from the peak of the distribution .",
    "the variance was calculated by modifying the @xmath233 formula as follows .",
    "if @xmath234 is the number of lines of sight with mean fluxes within the bin of the mode and k is the array of indices the represents those los then @xmath235 .",
    "our intent is to measure how the low transmission lines of sight at high redshifts , which are more numerous and therefore have a higher probability of being measured , affect mapping reionization .",
    "our calculations show that the high - z low transmission lines of sight ( solid curve ) will indeed underestimate the global average of the mtf value ( dashed curve ) by @xmath236dex ( solid curve in lower left panel ) during the last redshift interval ( z=6.44 - 6.60 ) , which samples the reionization tail . however , the use of such lines of sight will not alter the instance where the flux redshift evolution breaks from a smooth profile .",
    "in fact , the break is steeper when compared to the mtf evolution .",
    "therefore , a sample of low transmission lines of sight might offer insight to when the reionization is almost complete but they will not offer a reliable measurement of the global average of the transmitted flux during reionization . on the other hand , rare high transmission lines of sight at high redshifts",
    "will miss the break of the mtf evolution at the end of reionization and infer the continuation of a smooth profile .",
    "such is the case of the cross points on the left panels of figure  ( 12 ) , where we plot the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux based on lines of sight that have los - mean values @xmath237 in the last redshift interval .",
    "our conclusion is reinforced by the calculation of the variance for the low transmission lines of sight which is indeed smaller for @xmath238 when compared to the global mtf variance computed in the previous section ( right panels ) .",
    "the computed difference of @xmath239dex ( in standard deviation units ) in the last redshift interval may be considered small however it increases the confidence in the mean transmitted flux value inferred by a sample of high - z low transmission lines of sight .",
    "our differentiation between low and high transmission lines of sight was based upon examining los - mean values computed from the arithmetic mean of pixel flux values across the redshift interval of our choice ( @xmath240 )",
    ". therefore , the same type of bias exists toward high transmission regions when computing the flux average along a single line of sight .",
    "this effect depends on the size of the redshift interval . with fixed redshift resolution ,",
    "the smaller the size of the redshift bin at high redshifts the more susceptible our mean value is to the presence of a high transmission region .",
    "if the majority of the transmitted flux has values much less than the arithmetic mean then the size of the redshift bin should be increased to give statistical power to the low transmission segments within a line of sight .",
    "on the left panel of figure  ( 13 ) we plot the discrete flux distribution ( dfd ) in constant logarithmic bins ( @xmath241 ) in the redshift interval z=5.95 - 6.45 , in the lres case only .",
    "the curve was computed by averaging the number of pixels from all lines of sight in each bin and hence the presence of error bars at large flux values .",
    "the curve was then normalized to the total number of pixels . for reference , we overplotted the mean - flux ( solid - line ) and the upper - bound extreme of the becker gap ( shaded area ) .",
    "the graph shows that low transmission regions have the largest probability of detection at high redshifts .",
    "we can then compute from the graph , that flux values less than the upper - bound of the becker - gap have a probability of @xmath242% of being recorded in our synthetic spectra .",
    "however , the mean flux computed in the redshift interval and represented by the dashed line , lies in high transmission flux bins . in the right panel of figure",
    "( 13 ) we plot the mean transmitted flux in each of the flux bins of the dfd curve is plotted against the mean flux in each bin .",
    "in addition to the discrete flux distribution curve we also compute the cumulative distribution of transmissions ( rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , following songaila and cowie ( 2002 ) . on the left panel of figure",
    "( 14 ) we plot the cumulative lres - flux distribution ( cfd ) for the redshift bins ( from bottom up ) ( 4.25 - 4.75 ) , ( 4.95 - 5.45),(5.45 - 5.95 ) . in addition , we include the dfd redshift bin ( 5.95 - 6.45 ) which samples the transmitted flux close to the reionization tail .",
    "the data points for the first three bins are extracted sample values from the observed cdf - curves in figure  ( 8) from songaila and cowie ( 2002 ) .",
    "for each transmitted flux threshold ( x - axis ) we average the fraction of the flux that lies below the threshold value ( y - axis ) from all lines of sight and compute the standard deviation .",
    "the shaded areas are included between the @xmath243 curves .",
    "there is a general agreement with the observed data in the low and medium transmission region .",
    "we believe that the disagreement in the high transmission end of the x - axis is due to the sensitivity of the cfd to the extrapolated continuum in the observed data .",
    "the right panel of figure  ( 14 ) is an x - axis logarithmic zooming into the cdf profile of the last redshift bin .",
    "similarly to the right panel of figure  ( 13 ) we overplot the becker - gap mean flux and upper - bound extreme .",
    "the curve shows that @xmath242% of all the flux pixels in the redshift interval z=5.95 - 6.45 are below the becker upper - bound extreme .",
    "in the previous sections , we have determined that high transmission regions in the ly@xmath2 forest at large redshifts become rare close to the epoch of reionization .",
    "therefore an alternate method to analyzing the statistical properties of the transmitted flux is instead the distribution of dark gaps ( croft 1998 ) . by convention a transmission gap",
    "is defined as a contiguous region of the spectrum with @xmath244 over rest - frame wavelength intervals greater than @xmath245 .",
    "the gap distribution is then the frequency distribution function of the gap wavelength width ( gww ) .",
    "songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) obtained the gap distribution in the ly@xmath2 region of the high redshift quasars br 1202 - 0725 and sdss 1044 - 0125 in four redshift intervals ( 3.5 - 4.0 ) , ( 4.0 - 4.5 ) , ( 4.5 - 5.0 ) and ( 5.0 - 5.5 ) which showed a slow variation below z=5.0 and a rapid increase in the number of gaps at @xmath246 . in this section ,",
    "we repeat their analysis using our synthetic spectra samples adding two higher redshift intervals , ( 5.5 - 6.0 ) and ( 6.0 - 6.5 ) .",
    "in figures  ( 15,16 ) we plot the gap width distribution ( gwd ) against the gww in constant logarithmic bins of size 0.25 .",
    "the number of gaps per gww - bin is averaged from all lines of sight and then normalized to the redshift path , @xmath247 $ ] , where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are the upper and lower bounds of the redshift interval .",
    "overplotted in figure  ( 15 ) are the observed data ( diamonds ) from songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) .",
    "the vertical lines are the observational error bars .",
    "if no diamond - points are associated with a vertical line then what is plotted is an upper bound estimate . in order to compare with the observed redshift evolution of the gwd",
    ", we consider contiguous gaps where the ly@xmath17 optical depth also satisfies the dark - gap threshold ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath17 optical depth is derived from the sum of the direct ly@xmath17 absorption and the ly@xmath2 absorption at the redshift @xmath251 ( songaila & cowie 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath252    where @xmath253 is the ratio of the product between the oscillator strength and the resonant scattering wavelength for @xmath254 and @xmath255 . in figures  ( 15,16 ) the red symbols ( triangles : fres ,",
    "crosses : hres & squares : lres ) show the computed gwd distributions .",
    "there is a general agreement with the observations in matching the redshift evolution of the gwd .",
    "however , our calculations generally predict higher frequency values in the in the gww range @xmath256 ( in log units ) at z=3.5 - 5.5 .",
    "the lres data are below the corresponding full / high resolution results for gww values @xmath257 and therefore tend to be in closer agreement with the observed points .",
    "the difference between the high and low resolution can be explained as follows .",
    "the sharp wings of two high transmission regions , separating a single gap in the hres / fres cases are smoothed out in the lres case and this results in a smaller gww value for the gap .",
    "small size gaps are more sensitive to the convolution process because the spread of the gap is more influenced by the wings of the two bounding high transmission regions .",
    "therefore , a reduction in the computed gww value for the small size gaps effectively causes the translation of the fres / hres distribution leftward .",
    "however , due to the cutoff value of 1   in the gww size some gaps would be dropped in the lres gwd calculation .",
    "all computed gwd curves have power - law segments but also exhibit a power - law break below a redshift dependent gww value . when compared to the observed results in the bin z=4.5 - 5 , which have a clear power law distribution",
    ", the power - law portion of the computed gwd has a steeper slope .",
    "our calculations essentially mean that we detect more smaller size gaps than observed and most likely fewer larger size gaps .",
    "we believe that this is due to our limited box size . due to our fixed integration redshift step ( @xmath258 ) , each line of sight would cross the simulated volume a number of times before progressing to the next redshift dump .",
    "therefore , there is a non - zero probability that a number of different lines of sight could register a resonant absorption feature from the same cosmic neighborhood .",
    "thus , an excess in the number of gaps of a particular size , when compared to the observed value , may be an effect of oversampling .",
    "on the other hand , the size of our simulated volume does not adequate sample the high end of the mass power spectrum . in massive objects , like large galaxies",
    ", the large abundance of neutral hydrogen would register as large dark gap features in a transmission spectrum .",
    "the absence of such features in the computed gwd curve could be due to the lack of such objects in the volume or that , our sample of lines of sight simply missed them .    despite the disagreement on the exact shape of the gwd profile , our calculations reproduce in general the redshift evolution of the gap distribution inferred by observations .",
    "the slow evolution toward larger gaps between z=3.5 - 5.0 is followed by a rapid change in the gwd in observed and simulated data alike .",
    "between z=5 - 5.5 , both relay an increase in the total number of gaps .",
    "specifically , the number of gaps with gww values @xmath259 ( in log units ) exhibit a sharp increase which causes the gap distribution to flatten .",
    "moreover , if we take into account the observed upper limit error estimates then the observed power - law profile featured in the previous redshift bin evolves to one similar to our calculation .",
    "however , we are compelled to note that the decrease of the observed gap distribution in the smallest gww bin ( @xmath260  ) between z=5 - 5.5 does not occur in our synthetic spectra until @xmath261",
    ". that may be due to comparing between results sampled and normalized by radically different number of lines of sight ( 2 versus 75 ) or that the reionization epoch inferred by the observed lines of sight occurs earlier than in our setup .",
    "figure  ( 16 ) shows that between z=5.5 - 6 the larger size gaps continue to grow in numbers while the smaller ones increasingly disappear .",
    "this `` gap size reshuffling '' trend continues in the last redshift interval which also includes gaps with sizes @xmath262  .",
    "in addition , we plot in figure  ( 17 ) the total number dark - gaps per redshift path which decreases at @xmath263 after reaching a peak at @xmath264 .",
    "this evolutionary trend of the gwd at high redshifts is more profoundly shown in the lres case .",
    "a narrow `` high transmission '' region separating two adjacent gaps in the full / high resolution cases maybe convolved to a profile below the dark flux cutoff ( @xmath265 ) in the lres case .",
    "this would manifest as a merging between the individual gaps , which would disappear in the lres sample , and the creation of a single larger size gap .",
    "the lres case simply illustrates more profoundly how the `` gap size reshuffling '' occurs in all spectral resolution cases . as the redshift increases towards the reionization phase , not only the frequency but also the amplitude of high transmission regions decreases . therefore ,",
    "when the transmitted flux in a previously `` high transmission region '' drops below the dark flux cutoff , the adjacent gaps merge into a single one of a bigger size .",
    "this may explain why small size gaps rapidly disappear while large gaps rapidly appear in the gwd between z=6 - 6.5 .",
    "the rate of the gap size increase is shown in figure  ( 18 ) where we plot ( left panel ) the mean gww against the mean redshift in each interval . we note the accelerated rate of increase at redshifts @xmath266 .",
    "it is evident that the slope would have been steeper if the results were plotted against cosmic time rather than redshift .",
    "the evolution progresses toward the reionization phase linearly with redshift up to @xmath267 followed by a steep power - law type increase . to infer a power - law profile we used cubic interpolation between the data to acquire more points .",
    "two least square fits are shown in figure  ( 18 ) .",
    "a linear regression fit to the data at @xmath268 yields the following parametric fit , @xmath269 , where @xmath270 , @xmath271 .",
    "the numbers in the parentheses refer to the low resolution data ( dashed curves in figure ) . for simplicity",
    "we treated the fres and hres cases as identical and used the full resolution data only . at @xmath272 a power - law fit in the form @xmath273 yields @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "we reported our fits in high precision because the profiles are very sensitive to the exact values in a linear - linear plot .",
    "as before , the parentheses refer to the lres data .",
    "the normalized to the mean standard deviation ( @xmath276 ) ( right - panel ) exhibits a similar evolutionary trend .",
    "a linear evolution up to @xmath277 is followed by a rapid increase under a strong power - law ( @xmath278 ) for larger redshifts . as a result ,",
    "the 1@xmath279 deviation becomes comparable to the mean gww at about @xmath280 which reflects the broadening of the gwd in the two high redshift intervals ( figure  ( 16 ) left - panel ) .",
    "the extrapolation of our crude fits to z=6.9 , which within @xmath258 corresponds to the beginning of reionization in our setup , yields an estimate of the statistical mean value for the gap wavelength width of @xmath281   ( lres fits ) . in comparison ,",
    "the ly@xmath2 transmission at z=6.9 in a redshift interval of @xmath258 corresponds to @xmath282   which is less than 1@xmath279 from the mean gap width . in effect",
    ", we can characterize the entire spectral region at that redshift as a `` trough '' and infer that the igm is in effect neutral .",
    "our calculation begun by making an educated guess of the initial redshift and the profile of reionization which allowed for the derivation of the igm s global ionization properties and evolution . even though synthesizing spectra at small rcp ( reionization completion parameter ) values was impractical with our method ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) , the extrapolation of fits to the redshift evolution of the mean gap width allowed for a consistent determination , within the statistical errors , of when reionization begun .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the mean gap width can be used as an alternative method of reionization mapping .",
    "the clear advantage of gap statistics over using the mean transmitted flux at redshifts right after or during reionization , is that the mtf is biased by high transmission regions , in real and redshift space alike , that become increasingly rare and narrow as the redshift increases .",
    "any conclusions drawn in that case will be affected by small number statistics ( too few lines of sight ) and the large flux variance as we discussed in previous sections of this work . on the other hand ,",
    "as the dark gaps grow in size they include an increasingly larger portion of the local optical depth along a line of sight and therefore volume fraction of the igm , which is significant if we are to make any claims about the igm s global ionization state .",
    "gaps also have the advantage that they are insensitive to the exact flux values of the high transmission regions that bound them .",
    "in addition , since the measurement of transmission values below the cutoff is more probable as we approach the reionization phase , we expect that the line of sight variance will not be as important factor as it was in examining the mtf properties .",
    "nonetheless , a disadvantage of the gap size analysis we have performed so far is that we can not directly infer quantitative properties of the underlying baryon distribution inside the gaps since all opacity information is reduced down to a single optical depth value , the optical depth threshold . for the remainder of this section , we investigate a possible correlation between the size of a gap and some measure of the gap s optical depth .",
    "the motivation is that if such association exists it is a measure of the coupling between dark gap statistics ( size ) and transmitted flux statistics ( amplitude ) .",
    "one choice is the arithmetic `` mean pixel optical depth '' within each gap region . in figures  ( 19,20 )",
    ", we scatter plot the mean ly@xmath2 against the mean ly@xmath17 optical depth for each gap with wavelength width spread larger than 1   and for mean pixel optical depth greater than 2.5 .",
    "the slope of the straight line is equal to the ratio @xmath283 .",
    "the color bar on figure  ( 19 ) shows the allocation of color for each pair of optical depths based on their measured gap width .",
    "the points were sequentially plotted from the smallest to the largest gww value and therefore each color represents the largest gap value measured in the local of a mean optical depth pair @xmath284 .",
    "the solid colored regions on the graph represent the `` exclusion zones '' where both the ly@xmath2 and ly@xmath17 optical depths are smaller than 2.5 .",
    "since every pixel across a contiguous gap has optical depth above the cutoff threshold , ( @xmath285 ) , the average pixel optical depth in a gap is also above the same cutoff value .",
    "this measure of a gap s optical depth would be heavily biased by the presence large pixel optical depth values and is equivalent to associating the size of a gap to the opacity of the most underionized region(s ) ( largest overdensities ) it contains .",
    "the scatter of the data in figures  ( 19,20 ) is due to the second term , @xmath286 , in equation  ( 5 ) which we used to compute the ly@xmath17 optical depth .",
    "the data points are scattered upwards , along the y - axis and off the constant slope line because of the contribution to @xmath287 from ly@xmath17 photons redshifted to the ly@xmath2 frequency at a later redshift @xmath288 . for @xmath289 values between 15.625 - 2.5 the second term",
    "needs to contribute at least between 0 - 2.1 optical depth units respectively to @xmath287 for the pixel to be part of a `` dark gap '' . for @xmath290",
    "all associated ly@xmath17 pixel optical depths are above the optical depth cutoff .",
    "since the numbers of pixels with @xmath291 increases as the redshift decreases , the identification of `` dark gaps '' fitting all the constrain parameters becomes increasingly more dependent on the value of the @xmath286 term . on the other hand ,",
    "as the redshift decreases the average igm opacity at @xmath292 is smaller ( @xmath293 ) while the baryon mass clumping is larger ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "consequently , it becomes increasingly rare for the redshifted ly@xmath17 photons to be resonantly scattered from a high opacity region . on average , the contribution of the @xmath286 term decreases with redshift and that results in an increasing number of `` off - slope dark gap '' candidates being flagged out .",
    "the above argument explains why the scatter of the averaged optical depth gap pairs decreases with decreasing redshift .",
    "we can measure the scatter off the constant slope line by computing the median ratio between the mean ly@xmath17 and ly@xmath2 gap optical depths at each redshift interval .",
    "it is difficult to gauge such relation from figures  ( 19,20 ) since in each local of mean optical depths we can only visualize the largest gap size . any information of the scatter plot density is effectively masked out by the size of the plotting symbols . for comparison purposes , we will also introduce an alternate method of measuring the optical depth properties of a gap .",
    "that is the gap `` effective optical depth '' which is computed by the negative natural logarithm of the transmitted flux averaged within the bounds of the dark region .",
    "contrary to averaging pixel optical depths which is sensitive to large values and therefore biased by the least ionized regions , this approach relates a gap to the opacity of regions ionized the most within the gap s bounds .",
    "the effective optical depth of a spectral region can be associated to a characteristic overdensity value where @xmath295 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath296 is the optical depth at the cosmic mean density and @xmath17 is a function of the adiabatic index @xmath297 ( appendix i , ii ) . on the left panel of figure  ( 21 )",
    ", we plot the redshift evolution of @xmath298 , between @xmath299 for different choices of the normalized ionization rate , along with @xmath112 from figure  ( 6 ) .",
    "the latter is consistently below the @xmath298 curves which indicates that it corresponds to overdensities @xmath300 .",
    "if we overplot about the effective optical depth the evolution of @xmath301 , for three adiabatic index values using the ionization rate inferred by the equation  ( 3 ) fit to our data ( @xmath130 ) , we see that the three curves contain the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth . therefore , the latter can be associated to a characteristic overdensity @xmath302 . the exact value scales with redshift as shown on the right panel where we compute @xmath303 from @xmath304 in the redshift interval z=4 - 6.4",
    ". irrespective of the normalized ionization rate type or adiabatic index , which are listed on the figure , the characteristic overdensity @xmath303 associated with the effective optical depth decreases with increasing redshift . for @xmath305 and @xmath306 , @xmath303 scales between 0.42 to 0.32 at z=4 and z=6.4 respectively . in conclusion ,",
    "the effective optical depth is biased by the highly ionized low overdensity regions .",
    "the previous statement is based on properties of the entire spectrum regardless of an optical depth cutoff .",
    "nonetheless , we can apply the method to the transmission fraction sampled by the dark gaps .",
    "since that fraction increases as we approach reionization , it is expected that the characteristic overdensity associated with the gap effective optical depth at high redshifts to closely match the one inferred by all transmitted flux pixels .",
    "we first compute in figure  ( 22 ) the redshift evolution of the scatter between the mean optical depth and the effective optical depth for each dark gap in the redshift intervals we considered .",
    "the two types are not correlated for mean optical depths larger than @xmath307 at @xmath308 but are positively correlated at @xmath4 .",
    "they are also positively correlated for @xmath309 at all redshifts .",
    "we then proceed to convert the scatter plots in figure  ( 22 ) to the scatter plots in figure  ( 23 ) between the characteristic overdensities @xmath303 estimated by @xmath310 for @xmath311 and @xmath312 ( mean optical depth ) or @xmath313 .",
    "the figure shows that the effective optical depth is biased by smaller overdensities than the mean optical depth . in the redshift range approaching reionization",
    "the characteristic overdensity inferred by the effective optical depth of the dark gaps is entirely in the underdense ( @xmath300 ) range .",
    "an overdensity average in the last redshift interval ( 6 - 6.5 ) yields @xmath314 which is comparable to @xmath315 , the value derived from figure  ( 21 ) at @xmath316 for the same @xmath297 and choice of the normalized ionization rate . for comparison , the overdensity average inferred from the gap mean optical depth in the same redshift range is @xmath317 which statistically samples the cosmic mean density .",
    "it is evident from the preceding analysis that the two gap optical depth definitions offer two competitive perspectives on the properties of the underlying baryon distribution sampled within the dark regions and therefore together they yield a more complete description of the gap opacity evolution .",
    "we can now plot on the left panel of figure  ( 24 ) the evolution of the median ratio between the mean ly@xmath17 and mean ly@xmath2 optical depths from figures  ( 19,20 ) ( blue histogram ) .",
    "in addition , we also plot ( red histogram ) the median ratio if we instead use the effective optical depth of a gap . as expected , the redshift evolution of both histograms show a progressive reduction of the median ratio at smaller redshifts which illustrates the decrease of the data - scatter off the constant slope line observed in figures  ( 19,20 ) .",
    "the asymptotic value of the ratio in the mean optical depth case approaches 0.16 by z=3.5 as predicted by equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "both computed ratios show that the ly@xmath17 optical depth is an important selection bias in the flagging process of a low transmission region as a `` dark gap '' . according to figure  ( 24 ) , at redshifts following reionization completion , the mean ( effective ) gap ly@xmath17 optical depth can be as much as @xmath220% ( @xmath242% ) that of the mean ( effective ) ly@xmath2 optical depth .",
    "a detailed examination of the redshift profiles in each case , which primarily depend on the spectral slope and evolution of the uvb ( songaila & cowie 2002 ) , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we can however , estimate their relative scale averaged across the redshift range .",
    "the evolution of the gap mean optical depth yields an average median offset @xmath318 between z=3.5 - 6.5 .",
    "in addition , we can postulate that during the post - reionization smooth evolution of the igm opacity , the offset in the effective optical depth ratio can be approximated by @xmath319 , where @xmath320 .",
    "substituting for the power law exponent @xmath321 from equation  ( 2 ) we can then estimate that @xmath322 and an average scale between the two median rations of @xmath323 which is consistent with the median histograms in figure  ( 24 ) .",
    "we have shown in figure  ( 22 ) that in general , @xmath324 at all redshifts .",
    "this is also illustrated on the left panel of figure  ( 24 ) where the median ratio of ly@xmath17 to ly@xmath2 optical depths is larger in the case of @xmath325 . in scatter plot layouts similar to figures  ( 19,20 ) , points corresponding to pairs ( @xmath326 ) will be distributed in regions further to the left of the constant slope line when compared to @xmath327 pairs .",
    "however , as we shall shortly show , the ly@xmath2-ly@xmath17 distributions for @xmath325 lack an important attribute that the @xmath327 distributions have . in figure",
    "( 20 ) , the scatter plots for the last two redshift intervals , gaps with sizes larger than 100   ( red color symbols ) , measured after @xmath5 in our setup , correspond to mean ly@xmath2 optical depths larger than @xmath328 .",
    "this suggests a correlation between the gap size and the gap mean optical depth which is in fact illustrated by the way the data are plotted .",
    "the sequential color plotting from smaller gap sizes to larger ones reveals that there is a trend in the color scheme(size ) to move to the right along the x - axis ( ly@xmath2 mean optical depths ) and upwards along the y - axis ( ly@xmath17 mean optical depths ) , in other words toward larger mean optical depth values . in order to measure this trend ,",
    "we plot on the right panel of figure  ( 24 ) the redshift evolution of the `` pearson correlation coefficient '' between the distributions of the gap ly@xmath2 mean optical depth ( @xmath327 ) and wavelength width ( gww ) .",
    "we note a weak but positive correlation persistent throughout the redshift range , with values between @xmath329 ( blue histogram ) . the same calculation between @xmath325 and",
    "gww yields a positive but much weaker correlation ( @xmath330 ) in the last redshift interval only . for @xmath308",
    "the gap effective optical depth and size are uncorrelated .",
    "this result is not a surprise because in figure  ( 22 ) we showed that there is little correlation between @xmath325 and @xmath327 at @xmath308 .",
    "finding a positive correlation between @xmath327 and gap size precludes a positive correlation between @xmath325 and gap size .",
    "the two optical depth types are largely uncorrelated because the mean optical depth is sensitive to a more extended range of baryon overdensities .",
    "as the dynamical range of overdensities becomes smaller at large redshifts the correlation improves .",
    "intuitively , the result on the right panel of figure  ( 24 ) can be understood in terms of the opacity averaging procedure in each case .",
    "the mean optical depth method gives equal statistical weight at each local optical depth value along the gap .",
    "therefore , the bigger the size of a gap the more extended the dynamical range of opacities sampled and consequently the direct mean being a `` point - estimator '' of all opacity data within the gap will reflect that .",
    "hence , the two quantities will be to some degree correlated irrespective of redshift .",
    "on the other hand , the effective optical method gives equal statistical weight to the local flux .",
    "the optical depth estimate in this case is biased by a fraction of the gap , the regions of lowest opacity associated with the low end of the overdensity range sampled along the gap .",
    "hence , the total size and the effective optical depth of a gap are in principle uncorrelated . however , the approach of reionization in the last redshift interval shifts the overdensity bias in this method entirely in the underdense range , shown in figure  ( 23 ) , which dominates the volume filling factor .",
    "thus the segment of the gap to which the effective optical depth is sensitive to rapidly increases to a size comparable to the gap width , hence the sharp change from the uncorrelated profile at @xmath308 to a weak but positive correlation at @xmath331 .",
    "a similar jump of the same magnitude is also evident in the blue histogram , however it is a more dramatic effect to traverse from completely uncorrelated data to some correlation at larger redshifts .",
    "the exact values of the correlation coefficients in each case will depend on the redshift bin - size .",
    "the bin - size of @xmath332 , which was chosen for constructing the gap width distribution , is most likely too large to showcase the transition to high correlation coefficients between size and optical depth as we cross into the reionization phase .",
    "our values in the interval z=6 - 6.5 from the histograms on the left panel of figure  ( 24 ) are probably smooth out averages between large values at @xmath333 and small values at @xmath108 .",
    "in this work we investigate properties of the ly@xmath2 transmission at redshifts during and after reionization . we have performed a numerical simulation of the ly@xmath2 forest where ionization of the primary species is due to a homogeneous uvb ( fig.1,2 ) which we switch on at a redshift that is consistent with numerical and observational results which place the era of reionization at @xmath34 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "we synthesized noiseless synthetic spectra along a fixed number of lines of sight through the simulated volume and measured the ly@xmath2 flux transmission between z=6.6 - 2.5 ( samples shown in fig.4 ) .",
    "in addition to the full pixel resolution spectra we obtain two more by convolving our spectra down to the hires kecki and the esi resolution values .    because of limits placed by our finite box size",
    ", we made no effort to explicitly match high redshift data , rather study a realization of the ly@xmath2 forest consistent with the results by songaila ( 2004 ) , that asserts a smooth profile for the effective optical depth beyond the becker trough .",
    "the specific input parameters for our calculation were chosen to match low and intermediate redshift data derived in previous simulations ( jena et al .",
    "our reionization profile is for all practical purposes artificial .",
    "it serves the purpose of measuring the effect a reionization phase has on observable quantities by it s mere presence in the high redshift universe .",
    "we use the reionization completion parameter ( rcp ) as a dimensionless variable to quantify the degree of reionization based on deviations from a smooth profile of the mean hi ionization fraction . in doing",
    "so we introduce a visualization technique to probe the fraction of the reionization profile that our observable quantities sample ( fig.8 ) .    by placing the beginning of reionization at z=7 ,",
    "we achieve full reionization by @xmath334 and derive a smooth power law profile for the effective optical depth from low redshifts up to the tail of reionization ( fig.5,6 )",
    ". the smooth profile of our data between z=4 - 6.4 can also be fitted by the songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) analytic parametrization of the mean transmitted flux which was based on expanding the uniform igm optical depth formulation to a clumpy baryonic distribution ( fig.7 ) .",
    "the inferred slope for the normalized photoionization rate is shallower than the fit to the observed data however the inferred photoionization rate is consistent within errors to the one determined by our input uvb and computed temperature distribution ( fig.7 ) .",
    "as we enter the reionization tail , the mean transmitted flux ( mtf ) diverges away from the profile inferred from earlier redshifts which is the standard method of asserting the beginning of the reionization tail .",
    "however , we found that the large margins of error due to the inter - related effect of the cosmic and line of sight variances can be detrimental in the degree of certainty behind claiming a reionization era measurement at low rcp values , especially when high resolution spectra are used ( fig.8 ) .",
    "a measurement within the reionization tail can be statistically excluded if the margins of error to the mtf include the extrapolated smooth profile from earlier redshifts .    in section  ( 4.3 )",
    "we studied the evolution of the flux variance and found that the variance to the mtf is inherently related to the mean line of sight of variance ( fig.10,11 ) .",
    "each line of sight variance is a measure of the cosmic variance along that direction , which increases as the igm becomes more neutral .",
    "however , the increased variance along a line of sight introduces an increasing with redshift uncertainty in measuring the mean flux value and that error is carried over to the mtf computation , which is the average over all line of sight mean fluxes . in the end , the ability to determine a highly certain value for the mtf at high redshifts is inadvertently degraded as is indicated by the small kyrtosis value of the los - mean flux distribution within the reionization tail ( fig.11 ) . the only way to statistically measure the mtf value with a relatively small margin of error is to use an extraordinary number of lines of sight which is highly unlikely to be obtained observationally ( fig.11 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the uncertainty in the mean transmitted flux is unavoidable .",
    "the problem is compounded by the use of a mean flux analysis at high redshifts .",
    "the mean transmitted flux is a quantity that is biased by high transmission regions and the contribution of low transmission or dark segments of the spectrum is diluted away by the exponentiation of the local optical depth .",
    "this is an important issue at high redshifts where such high transmission regions become rare .",
    "however , their presence along a line of sight will result in a mean flux calculation which will closely resemble the magnitude of the high transmission region ( or few high transmission regions ) .",
    "this is the basis of the distinct probability of having to contend with a few large los - mean flux values within our sample of random lines of sight .",
    "their subsequent contribution to the mtf will also skew the results toward a larger value when compared to the result obtained if such high transmission los were to be excluded ( fig.12 ) . because that skewed value enters the calculation of the mtf variance",
    ", the deduced margins of errors will also be large and that finally will yield a picture that is statistically close to a smooth profile at a redshift when we are clearly within the reionization tail .",
    "a much clearer association between the properties of the transmitted flux and reionization is derived when instead of the mtf we use the mode ( most frequent value ) of the los mean fluxes ( fig.12 ) . in doing so",
    ", we effectively exclude rare high transmission measurements at high redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , what is more probable or less probable in the high redshift universe does not directly translate to the ability of observations to do measurements of the transmitted flux .",
    "in fact , due to noise and the selection bias of sky objects , there is a higher probability to observe a high transmission line of sight rather than a low transmission one which are more frequent but harder to measure . in the end",
    ", our conclusion is that observing a simultaneous steepening of the redshift profiles of the mtf and the flux variance ( irrespective of definition , type and spectral resolution ) relative to an extrapolated smooth evolution solidly points to the time when reionization terminates .",
    "however , the measurement of global properties of the igm and the uvb during reionization depends on the profile of reionization itself which is difficult to derive because of the intrinsic high degree of uncertainty of the data .",
    "another way to look at our result is that each line of sight appears to correspond or effectively is an attempt to measure it s own unique reionization profile along it s redshift path .",
    "the difficulty lies in ascertaining a single global reionization profile even if one is provided .",
    "we have come to this conclusion even when a uniform reionization uvb was used as an input . however , the assumed homogeneity of reionization through the global average of the igm opacity is a stretchy assumption .",
    "even if the uvb is uniform , the network of chemical reactions `` operates '' on an inhomogeneous baryonic distribution .",
    "the resulting opacity distribution is non - uniform and depending on the scale at which we view it , inhomogeneous as well .    in section  ( 5 )",
    "we also examined the properties of the flux distribution at high redshifts ( 5.45 - 6.45 ) ( both discrete and cumulative ) which shows that most of the transmitted flux ( @xmath242 % ) lies at values below @xmath335 or the upper limit of the becker ( 2001 ) trough .",
    "in contrast , the mean transmitted flux at these redshifts lies in the top 20 % of the flux distribution ( fig.13,14 ) .",
    "this suggests that the mean flux at high redshifts reflects the opacity properties of a portion ( volume fraction ) of the igm which becomes smaller as we approach reionization .",
    "therefore , even though becker - type troughs dominate at high redshifts , a mean transmitted flux analysis fails to register their contribution .",
    "our conclusion is that the traditional method of measuring properties of the ly@xmath2 forest through the mtf is deficient and needs to be supplemented by an analysis that directly involves low transmission regions .    in section  ( 6 )",
    ", we studied the distribution of `` dark gap '' sizes and it s evolutionary properties which becomes relevant at high redshifts because an increasingly larger fraction of the igm is sampled within them . when compared to the observed data of dark gap sizes",
    "our results differ marginally in the exact shape and extent of the distribution ( fig.15,16 ) . that maybe due to the fact that the observed data we considered consisted of only two lines of sight , when in this work we took into consideration all of our 75 lines of sight",
    "nonetheless , the redshift evolution towards reionization , from small to large redshifts , is consistent with the one deduced from observations .",
    "the results show an accelerated `` creation '' rate of larger size dark gaps at high redshifts ( fig.15 ) .",
    "the inclusion of two higher redshift intervals , which we did not have any observed data to compare to , reinforced the previous conclusion ( fig.16 ) .",
    "we suggested a mechanism of gap merging as a possible explanation of the occurrence of larger gap sizes as we approach reionization and measured the redshift evolution of the average gap width ( fig.18 ) .",
    "similarly to the mean transmitted flux analysis , the mean gap width and the error introduced by the increasing with redshift spread of the gap distribution steepen as the profile approaches reionization redshifts .",
    "crude fits of the computed results to a power law functional form and extrapolation to higher redshifts yields a mean gap size that with the error is comparable to the size of the transmission spectrum .",
    "the redshift at which the above occurs coincides with the beginning of reionization in our setup therefore , we conclude that such an extrapolation of the mean gap width to high redshifts , offers an appealing method in pinpointing the time at which reionization begun .",
    "finally , we found that there is positive correlation between the gap size and the mean optical depth of the pixels it contains ( fig.19,20,24 ) .",
    "such correlation couples the size of dark regions to the underlying opacity distribution .",
    "therefore , we conclude that by combining the analysis of the mean transmitted flux and dark gap sizes one can infer the properties of the entire igm structure sampled by a line of sight through the cosmic volume .",

    "standard calculation of an analytic approximation of the ly@xmath2 optical depth begins with the hi photo - ionization equilibrium condition that relates the number density of hi to the photo - ionization rate ( @xmath336 ) , the recombination coefficient @xmath337 , a function of the gas temperature , and the baryon density of hii under the assumption of the electron abundance being determined by hydrogen ionization only :    @xmath338    in a uniform igm after reionization @xmath339 , where @xmath340 is the cosmic hydrogen abundance and @xmath341 is the baryon cosmic mean . integrating the optical depth along a line of sight from redshift z to the present yields the uniform ly@xmath2 optical depth expression @xmath342 , where g is the normalized photo - ionization rate given in equation  ( 3 ) .",
    "a non - uniform igm approximation can be obtained by assuming that @xmath343 and integrating the rms value @xmath344 of the 3d hydrogen distribution along a line of sight . since @xmath345 , where @xmath346 is the baryon clumping factor , the non - uniform igm ly@xmath2 optical depth is then @xmath347 .",
    "the condition @xmath348 recovers the uniform expression .",
    "an expansion can be obtained ( hui & gnedin 1997 , croft 1998 , mcdonald & miralda - escud 2001 ) by assuming a power law dependence of the local optical depth to the local overdensity @xmath349 where @xmath350 .",
    "the mean transmitted flux , equation  ( 2 ) , can then be computed ( songaila & cowie ) by integrating @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the baryon distribution function ( miralda - escud , haehnelt & rees 2000 ) .",
    "the basis for the above approximations is the assumption @xmath343 .",
    "according to the top - left panel of figure  ( 8) this is good global approximation even during the late stages of reionization ( @xmath353% ) where the volume averaged neutral fraction decreases from @xmath354 at @xmath355 .",
    "however , the volume averaged neutral fraction of hydrogen is biased toward low overdensities which dominate the volume filling factor",
    ". at large overdensities , the approximation will not be as valid and therefore there will be a discrepancy between the distribution of hii in respect to the underlying baryons . in the context of homogeneous reionization",
    "that discrepancy is less significant when compared to inhomogeneous reionization with self - shielding but it s effect can not be ignored at times close to reionization . in our simulation",
    "the ratio of hii to baryon clumping factors scales between 0.5 at @xmath58 and 0.95 by @xmath356 . because the previous optical depth functional forms do not account for this `` chemical '' effect",
    "we do not allow the approximation @xmath357 but still use @xmath358 .",
    "@xmath359    where the ratio @xmath360 can be approximated by @xmath361 .",
    "therefore , the previous equation can be written in the form @xmath362 .",
    "the argument we make is that if the fgpa equation was the basis for expanding @xmath363 then to account for the difference in the clumping factor between the baryon and hii distributions at redshifts close to reionization we assume that equation  ( 2 ) applies under the expansion @xmath364 , where @xmath365 .",
    "the ratio of the clumping factors is then effectively absorbed in the normalized ionization rate .",
    "the mean transmitted flux , equation  ( 2 ) , was computed in songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) from the integral @xmath366where @xmath367 , @xmath368 is the optical depth in a uniform igm , @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "@xmath352 is the functional dependency of the volume density distribution ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "2000 ) on overdensity @xmath371 and @xmath372 .",
    "the integration via the method of steepest descents ( songaila & cowie 2002 ) yields a general functional form for the mean transmitted flux : @xmath373\\]]where @xmath374 is the value of @xmath371 at which the exponent in equation  ( 8) sharply peaks .",
    "the function f(g , z ) is then derived through the dependence of @xmath368 on the normalized ionization rate g , @xmath375 .",
    "the mean square value of the transmitted flux is similarly expressed by integrating @xmath376 instead of @xmath377 over the volume density distribution function .",
    "we can view the multiplication factor of 2 as a modifier of a constant ( @xmath368 ) in the integration and therefore we simply rewrite equation  ( 9 ) with @xmath378 instead of @xmath379 .",
