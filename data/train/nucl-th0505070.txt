    "the past decades have seen many successes in the relativistic treatment of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the relativistic framework has big advantages in several aspects @xcite : a useful dirac phenomenology for the description of nucleon - nucleus scattering @xcite , the natural incorporation of the spin - orbit force @xcite and the saturation properties of nuclear matter in the microscopic treatment with the dirac brueckner hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach @xcite .",
    "these results conclude that there are large attractive scalar and repulsive vector - fields , and that the nucleon effective mass is very small in the medium .",
    "however this small effective mass leads to small fermi velocity , which makes some troubles in the nuclear properties : too big magnetic - moment @xcite and too big excitation energy of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) state @xcite . as for the isoscalar magnetic - moment",
    ", this enhancement is cancelled by the ring - diagram contribution @xcite ; this relation is completely realized by the gauge invariance @xcite . as for the isovector one",
    ", however , this contribution does not plays a significant role because the symmetry force is not efficiently large .    in this subject",
    "most of people believed that the momentum dependence of the dirac fields is negligible in the low energy region , particularly below the fermi level .",
    "a momentum dependence of the schrdinger equivalent potential automatically emerges as a consequence of the lorentz transformation properties of the vector - fields without any explicit momentum dependence of the scalar and vector fields .",
    "in fact , only very small momentum dependence has appeared in the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) calculation @xcite .    in the high energy region , however , the vector - fields must become very small to explain the optical potential of the proton - nucleus elastic scattering @xcite , and the transverse flow in the heavy - ion collisions @xcite . the momentum - dependent part is not actually small though it has not been clearly seen in the low energy phenomena . furthermore s.  typel @xcite introduces the non - local parts and succeeded to improved nuclear properties .    in the previous paper @xcite we showed that the momentum dependence of the dirac - fields is very sensitive to the fermi velocity though it affects little the nuclear equation of state . in that work we introduced the one - pion exchange force , which produce the dominant contribution of the momentum dependence and",
    "suppresses the fermi velocity , and explain the isgqr energy .",
    "we can easily imagine that the one - pion exchange force largely produce the momentum dependence because the interaction range is largest .",
    "since the momentum - dependent fields break the current conservation , we have to define the new current caused by the vertex correction .    in this paper , thus , we investigate the nuclear current using the momentum - dependent dirac fields . for this purpose",
    "we define a new current to hold the current conservation in the momentum - dependent dirac fields , and discuss its effect on the the nuclear static current . in this work",
    "we focus only on the convection current which is sensitive to the fermi velocity , and omit the spin current .    in the next section",
    "we explain our formalism to make a conserved current under the momentum - dependent selfenergies . in sec .",

    "on the other hand the one - pion exchange force is a long range one and makes for a large momentum dependence while it does not contribute to the local part in the spin - saturated system .",
    "subsequently we make the local part by rh of the @xmath18- and @xmath19-meson exchanges , and the momentum - dependent part by rhf of the pion exchange , and thus we omit the kinetic energy part mesons except pion in eq.([lag ] ) .",

    "this term is very small if the selfenergy is independent of momentum @xcite , and their momentum dependence is actually very small as shown later .",
    "if the selfenergy has a momentum dependence , the current operator must be also changed to satisfy the current conservation .",

    "[ selfp ] we draw the momentum dependence of the scalar selfenergy @xmath125 and that of the time component of the vector selfenergy @xmath126 .",
    "it can be seen that the variation of the momentum - dependent selfenergies is only 2.5 % at most below fermi level , which looks very small .    in fig .",
    "[ selfd ] we show the density - dependence of the dirac selfenergies @xmath6 and @xmath127 on the fermi - surface ( a ) and the landau mass ( b ) with the parameter - sets , pf1 and pm1 .",

    "gives @xmath130 which overestimates the excitation energy of isgqr .",
    "hence it is shown that the very small momentum dependence in the nucleon selfenergies enhances the fermi velocity about 15 % , and gives a significant difference in the landau mass .",
    "furthermore we can also see an interesting behaviour of @xmath131 in pf1 , namely , its value agrees with the bare mass at @xmath132 and becomes larger with the decrease of the density .",

    "[ isosj ] . as for the isovector channel the core polarization does not affect the total current density noticeably .    the most direct observable for the nuclear static current must be the magnetic moment ; the nuclear medium effect is examined as the discrepancy from the schmidt value .",

    "on the other hand , the core polarization does not have significant effect . here",
    "we can see very interesting result that the total current density is 10 % less than the normal current density in low density region around @xmath138 .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental fact that the isovector magnetic moment is 10 % less than the schmidt value ; here we should note that the magnetic moment indicates the medium effect in surface region .",
    "of course our calculation is performed for the infinite matter , and does not include the contribution from the anomalous part .",
    "the result does not directly show the experimental observable , but this results is very suggestible .",
    "in this paper we have defined a current operator which is consistent with the momentum - dependent dirac fields .",
    "it was shown that this current operator automatically include the exchange current .",
    "this current operator describes the static spatial current which is determined by the landau mass @xmath131 independently of the effective mass @xmath61 .",
    "this fact is satisfied in all cases though we here show it only in the one - pion exchange case which is the most effective .",
    "furthermore we calculate the static current in the system with one valence nucleon on the fermi surface of the saturated nuclear matter . in this calculation",
    "we introduce the core polarization effect .",
    "we can confirm that the core polarization cancels the enhancement caused by the effective mass in the isoscalar current , but hardly affects the isovector current .",
    "as shown in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the very small momentum dependence in the nucleon selfenergies enhances the fermi velocity , even if this momentum dependence is negligibly small for the nuclear eos ; in the present calculation the fermi velocity is enhanced 15 % by the momentum dependence caused by the one - pion exchange .",
    "then we succeed to reduce the isovector current density in low density region ; the value of the current density is almost equivalent to the current density without effective mass at @xmath132 , and 10% suppressed around @xmath139 . the latter result is consistent with that the observed isovector magnetic moment is 10% smaller than the schmidt value ; of course the quantitative conclusion has not been so clear .    as seen in this paper the momentum - dependent parts , which are non - local in the finite nuclei , are very effective in observables related with fermi velocity even if these parts are small . in future",
    "we need to discuss effects of the non - local parts of dirac fields to study nuclear structure and reactions .",
    "the typical value of effective mass is empirically known as @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "if we use other parameter - set which give smaller effective mass than ours , the effects of the momentum - dependent part created by the one - pion exchange does not have a sufficient effect to explain the fermi velocity expected from experimental analysis .",
    "exchange forces of other mesons , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , also contribute to suppressing the fermi velocity if we choose the pv - coupling for @xmath24- and @xmath141- nucleon coupling .    here",
    "we should give a further comment .",
    "bentz et al . have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the landau mass is reduced by the one - pion exchange , which is opposite to ours .",
    "this result is consistent with the nonrelativistic analysis on the magnetic moment with the exchange current @xcite . in",
    "this work miyazawa showed that the exchange current enhances the convection part , reduces the spin part , and totally reduces the isovector magnetic moment . in the calculation",
    "@xcite bentz et al .",
    "have used the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) coupling , and the sign of @xmath143 was taken to be opposite to ours . the full hf calculation with the ps coupling makes too large contribution to the dirac selfenergies @xcite while bentz et al .",
    "calculated the fock term with a perturbative way .",
    "thus a calculation with the pv coupling must be more reliable than that with the ps coupling .",
    "the large discrepancy between the ps and pv coupling comes from relativistic effects in the one - pion exchange . since the pion mass is smaller than the nucleon fermi energy , relativistic effects must be larger in the one - pion exchange .",
    "miyazawa treated the one - pion exchange in the nonrelativistic way .",
    "thus it is not strange that our results qualitatively disagree with miyazawa s one .    in this work",
    "we calculate and discuss only the convection current , but not spin current .",
    "however our formalism is satisfied for the whole dirac current , thus the spin - current except for the anomalous current must be affects by the momentum dependence of the selfenergy in the same way . as for the anomalous current we have to consider the vertex correction in another way .",
    "since there is no connection between the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor in this current , we can suppose that a perturbative treatment gives sufficient results .",
    "it is one of the future works .",
    "since the fock effects are largely seen in the wide energy region @xcite , the new current we suggested here also plays an important role with the large momentum - transfer @xmath50 . in future",
    "we need to discuss effects of this current in the high momentum transfer phenomena such as the quasielastic electron scattering @xcite",
