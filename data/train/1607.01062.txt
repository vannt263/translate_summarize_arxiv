    "photo - ionised or `` warm '' absorbers are commonly observed in at least 50% of the uv / x - ray spectra of seyfert 1s and type-1 qso and are an important constituent of agn ( reynolds 1997 , crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 , porquet et al .",

    "the seyfert warm absorbers that are frequently observed at high spectral resolution with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ are now known to give rise to numerous narrow absorption lines , usually blue - shifted  implying outflowing winds  of a few hundred kms@xmath2 up to a few thousand kms@xmath2 .",

    "an open question is whether ark120 is intrinsically bare and devoid of circumnuclear x - ray emitting and/or absorbing gas , which may pose a challenge for unified schemes of agn that imply the existence of wide scale obscuring and emitting gas ( antonucci 1993 ) .",

    "spectra from the rgs1 and rgs2 were then also combined into a single rgs1 + 2 spectrum for each of the four xmm - newton sequences , having checked that the resultant spectra were consistent with each other before and after combining the two rgs modules .",
    "note that the spectral response files were subsequently averaged over the effective areas of the two rgs modules . in order to provide a very simplistic parameterization of the rgs spectra",
    ", we fitted the 0.352.0kev energy range ( or 6.20 35.4 ) with a continuum comprising a powerlaw plus blackbody component , whereby the blackbody emission provides an initial zeroth order description of the known soft excess towards this agn ( vaughan et al .",

    "an initial galactic absorption of hydrogen column density of @xmath28@xmath10 ( kalberla et al .",

    "( 2000 ) .",
    "figure1 shows the combined rgs1 + 2 spectra for each of the 4 sequences , whereby the spectral parameters are all consistent within the margin of error ; the average photon index was found to be @xmath29 , a blackbody temperature of @xmath30ev and a neutral absorbing column in the local ( @xmath31 ) galactic frame of @xmath32@xmath10 , slightly lower compared to the expected galactic neutral hi column from 21 cm measurements above .",
    "nonetheless the fit is statistically poor , with a reduced chi - squared of @xmath33 ( where dof is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit ) , with strong residuals around the position of the neutral oi edge as well as systematic - like residuals throughout the spectrum .",
    "however it can be seen that all 4 sequences are consistent with each other , aside from some small differences in their absolute fluxes , with the brightest spectrum corresponding to the first _ xmm - newton _  observation ( 0.42.0kev band flux , @xmath34erg@xmath10s@xmath2 ) and the faintest corresponding to the 2nd and 4th observations as above ( @xmath35erg@xmath10s@xmath2 ) .",
    "as the four spectra are consistent in shape , aside from a small difference in absolute flux of @xmath36% between the observations , they were subsequently combined to produce a single , deep , high signal to noise rgs spectrum of ark120 .",
    "this yielded net source count rates of @xmath37s@xmath2 and @xmath38s@xmath2 for each of the combined rgs1 and rgs2 spectra , with net exposures of 431.9ks and 430.8ks respectively .",
    "note the total number of source counts over all four sequences , obtained from combining both of the rgs1 + 2 modules , is @xmath39 counts , with an effective total exposure of 862.7ks providing a very high s / n soft x - ray spectrum of ark120 .",
    "the subsequent combined spectrum was binned into @xmath40  bins , which over - samples the rgs spectral resolution by at least a factor of @xmath41 compared to the fwhm resolution . due to the high count rate statistics ,",
    "@xmath42 minimization was employed in the subsequent spectral fitting , as typically there are @xmath43counts per @xmath44   resolution bin , corresponding to a s / n of @xmath45 per bin .      the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) onboard _ chandra _   also observed ark120 from 17 march to 22 march 2014 . due to scheduling constraints ,",
    "the _ chandra _  observations were split into 3 sequences , overlapping with the 1st , 2nd and 3rd of the _ xmm - newton _  sequences , with the 2nd sequence shorter than the other two , see table1 for details .",
    "spectra were extracted with the ciao package v4.3 .",
    "only the first order dispersed spectra were considered for both the meg ( medium energy grating ) and heg ( high energy grating ) and the @xmath46 orders for each grating were subsequently combined for each sequence .",
    "no significant spectral variability was observed between the 3 sequences and the spectra were consistent , with only modest @xmath47% variations in source flux .",
    "therefore the spectra were combined from all three sequences to yield a single 1st order spectrum for each of the meg and heg , yielding respective net source count rates of @xmath48s@xmath2 and @xmath49s@xmath2 respectively for a total exposure time of 120.5ks .",
    "thus the total counts obtained exceeded @xmath50 and @xmath51 counts for meg and heg respectively .",
    "note that the background contribution towards the count rate was negligible .",
    "due to the high flux ( @xmath52erg@xmath10s@xmath2 from 0.5 - 10kev ) and high count rates obtained from ark120 , the zeroth order image and spectra were not usable due to severe pile - up of the central source .",
    "the resultant 2014 1st order source spectra were subsequently binned to @xmath53  and @xmath54  bins for meg and heg respectively , which over - samples their respective fwhm spectral resolutions by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "the c - statistic was employed in the subsequent spectral fits with the hetg , as although the overall count rate is high , towards the lower energy ( longer wavelength ) end of each grating spectrum the total source counts per bin drops below @xmath56 in some bins . in the case of @xmath42 minimization , this would lead to the continuum level being somewhat underestimated at soft x - ray energies .",
    "initially we concentrated on the analysis of the time - averaged 2014 _ xmm - newton _  rgs observations .",
    "figure2 shows the overall 2014 @xmath57 rgs spectrum of ark120 , fluxed against a powerlaw of @xmath58 in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the spectrum shown in figure 2 is largely devoid of any strong ionized absorption lines in the agn rest frame , as might be expected for ark120 given its past record as a bare seyfert 1 galaxy and the lack of any warm absorber in the agn ( e.g. vaughan et al .",
    "the expected rest frame positions of several @xmath59 resonance lines ( e.g from the he and h - like ions of n , o , ne and mg ) are marked in the figure and there appears to be no significant absorption lines at any of these positions .",
    "however in the local ( @xmath31 ) observed frame , there appears to be several absorption features , in particular around the position of the neutral oi edge at @xmath60  there is a strong resonance absorption line ( at 23.5  or 527ev ) which may be identified with the k@xmath16 absorption line due to oi in our galaxy ( gorczyca et al .",
    "in addition another strong absorption line is observed near 31.2 , which likewise may be attributed to the neutral k@xmath16 resonance line of n. thus it appears clear we need to account for the absorption in the ism due to our own galaxy in the soft x - ray spectrum of ark120 , which we investigate below .",
    "furthermore , although there appears little in the way of intrinsic ionized absorption towards ark120 , there may be some indication ionized x - ray _ emission _",
    "lines associated with the agn , for instance associated with ovii , oviii , neix or mgxii .",
    "before investigating the presence of any ionized gas in emission ( or absorption ) intrinsic to ark120 , we first attempt to model the absorption associated with the line of sight through the ism of our own galaxy . due to the relatively low galactic latitude of ark120 ( @xmath61 ) , the galactic hi column is thought to be relatively high , with @xmath62@xmath10 as measured from 21 cm surveys ( stark et al .",
    "1992 , kalberla et al . 2005 ) and thus this absorption needs to be modeled before we can accurately determine the intrinsic emission properties of the agn . the galactic hydrogen column was allowed to vary , noting that there can also be an additional contribution associated with molecular hydrogen ( e.g. willingale et al . 2013 )    we fitted the combined mean 2014 rgs spectrum , adopting a powerlaw plus blackbody form to parameterize the soft x - ray continuum of ark120 . as the rgs bandpass contains a contribution from both the hard x - ray powerlaw extending up to higher energies up to at least 70kev ( e.g. matt et al .",
    "2014 , porquet et al .",
    "2016 ) , as well as the prominent soft excess below 2kev , we adopt both components in order to account for any spectral curvature present in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the agn continuum emission was parameterized by a photon index of @xmath63 and a blackbody temperature of @xmath64ev .",
    "for the galactic absorption , we initially adopted the tbvarabs model of wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which accounts for the photoelectric absorption edges due to abundant elements in the x - ray band and allows for the possibility of variable abundances compared to chosen tabulated solar values",
    ". a neutral hydrogen column of @xmath65@xmath10 was found , close to the reported 21 cm value above , with a relative o abundance compared to those in wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) of @xmath66 .",
    "however while this model provides a reasonable first order parameterization of the soft x - ray continuum of ark120 , the fit is statistically very poor , with a reduced @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "the tbvarabs or tbabs models only include the bound  free photoelectric absorption associated with the k and l - shell edges of abundant elements , but do not include any resonance absorption line structure due to the neutral ionization states of these elements .",
    "for instance figure3 ( upper panel ) shows the fluxed rgs spectrum ( obtained against a simple unabsorbed @xmath58 powerlaw model ) around the neutral o edge region , with the above tbvarabs photoelectric absorption model super - imposed upon the spectrum .",
    "it is apparent that the prominent oi k@xmath16 absorption line observed near 23.5  ( or 527ev ) is left unmodelled , whilst in reality the drop in the spectrum around the o edge ( observed between 22.7 23.0 ) is not sharp , which is likely due to the presence of several resonances around the edge threshold energy ( see de vries et al .",
    "2003 , gorczyca et al .",
    "2013 , gatuzz et al .",
    "indeed if we parameterize the 23.5  absorption with a simple narrow ( @xmath69ev ) gaussian absorption line we obtain an observed frame line energy of @xmath70ev ( or @xmath71 ) , which is in very good agreement with the expected energy of 527.4ev , as also found from measurements towards galactic binary systems ( gatuzz et al .",
    "furthermore a second strong absorption line is present at @xmath72ev or @xmath73   ( e.g. see figure 2 , lowest panel ) , which is in agreement with the expected position of the ni k@xmath16 line at 396.1ev ( kaastra et al .",
    "the parameters of these galactic absorption lines are also listed in table2 .",
    "upon addition of both of these ad - hoc galactic absorption lines , the fit statistic to the rgs data improves to @xmath74 , although the model is still formally rejected by the data .",
    "a more physical model was then adopted to model the galactic ism absorption towards ark120 , using the tbnew model , which is an improved higher resolution version of the original tbabs or tbvarabs ism absorption model of wilms et al .",
    "the tbnew model includes the various resonance absorption lines around the positions of the neutral o k - shell , ne k - shell and fe l - shell edges .",
    "the ism abundance table of wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was also adopted for the modeling .",
    "the power - law plus blackbody continuum form was retained from before , although the parameters are allowed to vary freely .",
    "the goodness of fit obtained is subsequently improved compared to the simpler tbvarabs model ( @xmath75 ) and the model is able to self consistently account for the strong oi @xmath76 absorption line present observed at 527.2ev ( or @xmath77 ) in the @xmath31 frame .",
    "figure 3 ( lower panel ) also shows a zoom - in around the o k - shell region , but with the best - fit tbnew overlaid on the fluxed rgs spectrum .",
    "in addition to the oi @xmath76 absorption line , the model provides a better description of the data around the o k - shell edge , due to the various higher order resonance line structures , which produces a more gradual decrease at the position of the o k - shell edge .",
    "figure 4 displays the same model , but now folded through the rgs instrumental response , versus the count rate spectrum and it can be seen that the model reproduces both the oi k@xmath16 edge region .",
    "we note here that the excess emission blue - wards of the o k - shell edge region is likely associated with emission from the ovii triplet , in the region from 561ev to 574ev in the agn rest frame , as can be seen in figure 4 . indeed",
    "several ionized emission lines are observed from the agn in the rgs spectrum , predominantly from the he and h like ions for n , o , ne and mg and the fit statistic improves considerably upon their inclusion in the model to @xmath78 .",
    "the soft x - ray emission line properties of ark120 are discussed in detail in section 5 .",
    "in addition the tbnew model also self consistently models the absorption around the neutral fe l and ne k edges respectively , for instance some structure around the fe l edge is also visible at 17.5  ( but much weaker than at oxygen ) in the fluxed spectrum in figure 2 .",
    "however the absorption line structure is not included around the ni k - shell edge region in tbnew and therefore we retain the simple gaussian absorption line to parameterize the visible ni k@xmath16 absorption line at 396.6ev .",
    "we subsequently adopt the tbnew model of the galactic absorption as our initial baseline model for the ism absorption towards ark120 , with the baseline absorption and continuum ( powerlaw plus blackbody ) parameters listed in table2 . note that while the oi k@xmath16 absorption line is self consistently fitted in the tbnew model , the simple gaussian line parameterization obtained from before is listed also in table2 for completeness .",
    "overall the hydrogen column density obtained by the tbnew model is @xmath79@xmath10 , which is slightly below the reported 21 cm value of @xmath62@xmath10 .",
    "however the neutral oxygen abundance relative to the ism values collated in wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( of @xmath80 ) is left free to vary ( other elements are fixed at solar ) . with respect to this value",
    ", the o abundance along the line of sight in the galactic ism is found to be mildly super - solar , with @xmath81 .",
    "if instead we adopt the earlier photospheric solar abundance table of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , which has a higher absolute oxygen abundance ( of @xmath82 ) , then the relative o abundance compared to this value is lower ( @xmath83 ) , while the hydrogen column is consistent with the previous value ( @xmath84@xmath10 ) .",
    "we then compared the ark120 soft x - ray spectrum with the ismabs absorption model ( gatuzz et al .",
    "in addition to the updated resonance line cross - sections around the o , ne k - shell and fe l - shell complexes , the model also can include the contribution from ism absorption from once and twice ionized ions from most of the cosmically abundant elements , as has been observed towards both galactic sources and agn ( pinto et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "a further advantage of the ismabs model is that it allows the user to directly determine the column density of both the neutral atoms of abundant elements ( as well as the ionized species ) , which can also be inferred indirectly from the tbnew model from the hydrogen column and then relative abundance ratio .",
    "applying the ismabs absorption model to the ark120 rgs spectrum results in a very similar fit as per the tbnew model ( with @xmath85 ) and the comparison of the parameters between these two ism models are tabulated in table3 .",
    "the hydrogen column density along the line of sight through our galaxy is also similar , with @xmath86@xmath10 .",
    "the neutral o column density was also allowed to vary , which primarily contributes towards the oi k@xmath16 absorption line as well as the higher order absorption , as per the tbnew model .",
    "the neutral o column density is found to be @xmath87@xmath10 , which thus corresponds to an abundance ratio of @xmath88 , which is a factor of @xmath89 above the relative o / h abundance value tabulated in wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , although again it is consistent with the higher o abundances tabulated by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .    the column densities of neutral n , ne and fe were also allowed to vary , the best fit values obtained from the ismabs model are:- @xmath90@xmath10 , @xmath91@xmath10 and @xmath92@xmath10 respectively .",
    "( see table3 ) .",
    "note the @xmath93 and @xmath94 abundances are consistent with the solar values in wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as tabulated in table 3 , while the @xmath95 abundance appears slightly higher compared to these tabulated values .",
    "all other elemental column densities were fixed according to their default solar abundances in the ismabs model , which otherwise assumes values calculated from grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , for a given hydrogen column .",
    "finally there appears to be no evidence for any ionized absorption associated with the galactic ism towards ark120 .",
    "if for the ismabs model we allow the column densities of once ionized o ( denoted o@xmath96 ) and twice ionized o ( denoted o@xmath97 ) to vary ( at @xmath31 ) , then only upper limits are found corresponding to @xmath98@xmath10 and @xmath99@xmath10 .",
    "these limits are at least a factor of @xmath100 and @xmath101 smaller respectively than the neutral o column through our galaxy .",
    "neither is there any evidence for any ism absorption associated with the host galaxy of ark120 , in the rest frame at @xmath8 .",
    "the limit on the column of any neutral o absorption at @xmath8 is @xmath102@xmath10 , which translates into a hydrogen column of @xmath103@xmath10 assuming a solar abundance of @xmath104 according to wilms et al .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising upon inspection of the rgs data ; at a redshift of @xmath8 , the oi k@xmath16 absorption line at 527.2ev ( or 23.52 ) corresponds to an observed energy of 510.5ev ( or 24.29 ) and there is subsequently no evidence for absorption at these positions in either figure 3 or 4 .",
    "the above analysis suggests that at least the oxygen abundance ( and possibly ne ) in the galactic ism towards ark120 could be somewhat higher than some of the tabulated solar ism values ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 , lodders 2003 , asplund et al .",
    "however while the column densities of o , ne and fe are well determined from the discrete atomic features ( absorption lines and edges ) in the rgs spectrum , the absolute hydrogen column density is inferred from the downwards curvature of the spectrum towards the lowest energies .",
    "thus the measured @xmath105 values may depend on how the soft x - ray continuum is modeled .",
    "therefore instead of the simple powerlaw plus blackbody continuum form , a continuum consisting of a powerlaw ( responsible for the continuum above 2kev ) and a comptonized disk blackbody spectrum was adopted , parameterized in this case by the comptt model ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1985 , titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "the latter component represents the compton upscattered wien tail of the optically - thick inner disk emission , which may be produced by a warm scattering layer above the disk and it has been suggested that such an emission component could reproduce the mainly featureless uv to soft x - ray excesses observed in many agn ( done et al . 2012 , jin et al .",
    "the main effect on the spectrum is that this produces a broader soft excess than a single unmodified blackbody component , as the latter would peak only in the uv band .    upon adopting instead",
    "comptt form for the soft x - ray excess , it is found that the hydrogen column density was somewhat higher compared to the powerlaw plus blackbody case .",
    "the absorption parameters are tabulated in table3 and applied to both the tbnew and ismabs absorption models ( denoted as tbnew2 and ismabs2 respectively in table3 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the neutral hydrogen column has increased for both cases , e.g. for the tbnew case , then @xmath106@xmath10 , slightly higher than the galactic value reported from 21 cm measurements . on the other hand",
    ", the column density of neutral oxygen remained consistent regardless of which form is adopted for the soft x - ray continuum , i.e. for the tbnew absorption model , then @xmath107@xmath10 ( for the blackbody case ) vs. @xmath87@xmath10 ( for the comptt case ) .",
    "thus when the soft x - ray spectrum is modeled with the comptonized disk spectrum , due to the higher implied @xmath105 values , the relative abundances are lower , largely consistent with the solar values . thus for oxygen , the relative abundances with respect to the solar values of wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are @xmath108 ( for tbnew ) and @xmath109 ( for ismabs ) respectively .",
    "finally we note the continuum parameters associated with the comptt model .",
    "as the hard powerlaw constrained primarily above 2kev is not well determined , its photon index has been fixed @xmath110 ( close to the best - fit value obtained for the epic - pn data , nardini et al .",
    "2016 ) , with a corresponding photon flux ( normalization ) at 1kev of @xmath111photons@xmath10s@xmath2 .",
    "for the comptonized disk spectrum , an input temperature for the seed photons of @xmath112ev is assumed , which may be reasonable for the emission from the inner optically thick disk around a black hole of mass @xmath113  in ark120 , with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath114ergs@xmath2 , as determined from the broad - band sed ( porquet et al .",
    "2016 ) , which suggests accretion occurs at a rate of at least 10% of the eddington value .",
    "these input seed disk photons are then assumed to be upscattered by a warm scattering medium , which we initially assume has an electron temperature of @xmath115kev ; for this temperature the optical depth required to account for the soft excess is @xmath116 .",
    "however @xmath117 and @xmath118 are largely degenerate upon each other ; if instead we adopt a lower temperature of @xmath119kev for the comptonizing electrons , then a higher optical depth of @xmath120 is obtained . in either case , the soft excess corresponds to between @xmath121% of the total unabsorbed 0.42.0kev band flux of @xmath122erg@xmath10s@xmath2 . note that the comptt model produces a similar goodness of fit compared to the simple powerlaw plus blackbody model , given the relatively narrow band of the rgs spectrum .    a further more detailed discussion into the nature of the soft excess will be presented in a subsequent paper ( porquet et al .",
    "2016 ) , which will investigate the broadband xmm - newton and _ nustar _ observations , as well as the modeling of the optical to hard x - ray sed obtained from simultaneous data as part of the 2014 campaign .",
    "having adequately described the galactic line of sight absorption towards ark120 , the intrinsic emission spectrum of ark120 was then investigated .",
    "it is known that ark120 is a bare seyfert 1 , which contains no intrinsic absorption associated with the agn , such as a warm absorber , which is also confirmed later in section5.5 from the contemporary 2014 observations .",
    "however one open question is whether the agn is truly bare , or indeed whether there is evidence for emission from photoionized gas surrounding the agn instead of absorption along our line of sight through the agn , as might be expected in the context of agn orientation dependent unified schemes ( antonucci 1993 , urry & padovani 1995 ) .    as a baseline model ,",
    "the powerlaw plus blackbody continuum model was adopted , using the tbnew model for the galactic ism absorption , with parameters reported in table 2 and described in the previous section .",
    "note that any dependency of the emission line spectrum on either the continuum form or the galactic ism model was checked and the subsequent parameters found to be consistent within errors . to provide an initial inspection of the contribution of any emission component , the summed 2014 rgs spectrum was first binned to a more coarse resolution of @xmath123  per spectral bin . this is a little worse than the intrinsic resolution of the rgs , which is typically @xmath124  ( fwhm ) over the 635  bandpass , but serves to highlight any prominent emission lines in the spectrum .",
    "the rgs spectrum binned to this resolution is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the baseline continuum and galactic absorption model overall provides a very good description of the shape of the rgs spectrum ( see upper panel ) , however several strong positive deviations at @xmath125 level are apparent in the lower panel .",
    "indeed the fit statistic of the baseline model to the binned rgs spectrum is poor , with @xmath126 , formally rejected with a corresponding null hypothesis probability of @xmath127 . indeed",
    "the addition of seven gaussian emission lines to the model significantly improves the fit statistic to @xmath128 , which is now statistically acceptable ( null hypothesis probability of @xmath129 ) .",
    "the centroids of the gaussian profiles are close to several strong expected k - shell lines of n through to mg ; their centroid energies and likely identifications are:- @xmath130ev ( nvii ly@xmath16 ) , @xmath131ev ( ovii he@xmath16 ) , @xmath132ev ( oviii ly@xmath16 ) , @xmath133ev ( fexviii @xmath134 or oviii rrc ) , @xmath135ev ( neix he@xmath16 ) , @xmath136ev ( mgxi he@xmath16 ) and @xmath137ev ( mgxii ly@xmath16 ) .",
    "thus most of the emission lines appear to be associated with the he and h - like transitions of abundant elements .",
    "several of the he - like lines appear to be resolved , especially for ovii , which when modeled with a single gaussian requires a line width of @xmath138ev .",
    "if these line widths are intrinsic , they would imply a significant degree of velocity broadening , with fwhm values in the range @xmath139kms@xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", the widths may be the result of a blend of contributions from the forbidden , intercombination and resonance emission components associated with the triplet emission , which is investigated further in section5.3 .      in order to provide a more accurate parameterization of the emission line spectrum and the line profiles",
    ", we reverted back to the spectrum binned at a finer resolution which adopted spectral bins of width @xmath140 over - sampling the fwhm resolution of the rgs by a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "the multiple spectral panels in figure6 show the data / model ratio of the rgs spectrum at this resolution to the baseline absorbed ( tbnew ) continuum model , over the 0.41.6kev range , whereby the expected rest energies or wavelengths of the main emission lines are marked with vertical dashed lines on the panels .",
    "the above emission line profiles are revealed in the residuals , in particular spectral structure is resolved around the he - like triplets especially from ovii and neix .",
    "furthermore positive residuals are also present in the region of the he - like nvi triplet around @xmath142ev , although this part of the spectrum has been more coarsely binned by a factor of @xmath143 as the signal to noise of the spectrum declines below 0.5kev .    as before ,",
    "the fit statistic improves considerably , now upon the addition of 8 gaussian line profiles including the emission from nvi , with the fit statistic decreasing substantially from @xmath75 without any line emission ( null hypothesis probability of @xmath144 ) to @xmath78 with the lines included .",
    "initially the he - like line profiles have been modeled with single broad gaussian emission lines and their properties , along with the h - like emission lines , are reported in table4 .",
    "for instance the ovii profile is resolved with a width of @xmath145ev , noting that the fit is significantly worse ( by @xmath146 ) if the line width is restricted to @xmath147ev .",
    "similar widths are also derived from the other he - like profiles ( although mgxi is less well determined , as is its centroid energy ) .",
    "the centroid energy of the ovii line at @xmath148ev suggests an identification with the intercombination emission from he - like oxygen , which may imply a high electron density ( porquet & dubau 2000 , porquet et al .",
    "2010 ) , which is discussed further later .",
    "the nvi triplet ( seen in the upper panel of figure 6 ) is similar in this regard , the line centroid energy of @xmath149ev is consistent with the majority of the emission originating from the intercombination transitions ( near 426.3ev ) , but is inconsistent with the expected energies of the forbidden ( at 419.8ev ) and resonance ( 430.7ev ) emission lines .",
    "conversely the centroid energy of the he - like triplet of neix measured at @xmath150ev is consistent with the expected energy of the forbidden line at 905.1ev , but appears inconsistent with the positions of the intercombination and resonance lines at 914.8ev and 922.0ev respectively .",
    "the modeling of the he - like triplets and the question of whether they are intrinsically velocity broadened or instead arise from a combination of the forbidden , intercombination and resonance components is discussed later in section 5.3 .",
    "the h - like lines from nvii , oviii and mgxii are all significantly detected close to their expected rest frame energies or wavelengths , with only the h - like line of nex not being formally detected , as listed in table4 . at first sight , unlike the emission from the he - like ions , the h - like lines generally appear to be unresolved , with the corresponding upper - limits given to their @xmath151 gaussian widths in table 4 .",
    "the h - like profiles are also discussed in further detail in the next section .",
    "the only uncertain identification is for the emission measured at @xmath152ev , which may be associated to l - shell emission from iron ( e.g. fexviii @xmath153 ) , but could also contain a contribution from the radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) of oviii .",
    "none of the higher order lines are detected , generally with tight upper limits .",
    "for instance the upper - limit on the flux from the ovii he@xmath154 emission ( @xmath155ev ) is @xmath156photons@xmath10s@xmath2 ( or an equivalent width of @xmath157ev ) , which implies a ratio of the @xmath158 emission of @xmath159 .",
    "likewise the ratio of fluxes of oviii ly@xmath16 to ly@xmath154 lines is @xmath160 .",
    "this may imply the line emission is associated with recombination ( and subsequent radiative cascade ) following photoionization rather than radiative decay following photo - excitation , as the latter process generally boosts the strengths of the higher order ( e.g. ly@xmath154 and he@xmath154 ) emission lines ( see kinkhabwala et al .",
    "if this is the case , detectable rrc emission may be expected .",
    "the data are consistent with the presence of the oviii rrc as noted above , with a total flux of @xmath161photons@xmath10s@xmath2 , while the limit obtained on the temperature is @xmath162ev ( or @xmath163k ) .",
    "formally the ovii rrc is not detected , with an upper limit of @xmath164photons@xmath10s@xmath2 on the photon flux .",
    "note that in the latter case , it may be difficult to detect an rrc feature , due to the large velocity width of the ovii emission , resulting in a weak and broadened profile .",
    "overall , the line emission is consistent with a photoionized plasma , a view supported by the xstar emission modeling presented later in section6.4 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum does not allow for any strong contribution from a collisionally ionized plasma , which appears consistent with the lack of any strong iron l - shell emission lines .",
    "furthermore , any resonance components in the he - like triplets are weak ( section5.3 ) , which generally implies a low temperature plasma . for a @xmath165kev temperature plasma with solar abundances ,",
    "the upper limit on the luminosity of any emission from a collisionally ionized plasma is @xmath166ergs@xmath2 , which is @xmath167% of the total 0.42.0kev band soft x - ray luminosity from the agn . in comparison",
    "the total luminosity derived from the gaussian emission line profiles is @xmath168ergs@xmath2 , thus any thermal plasma contributes less than 25% of the total line emission . in practice ,",
    "the contribution of a collisionally ionized plasma towards the observed emission lines is likely much smaller , as a significant proportion of the luminosity of any collisional plasma arises in the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum , rather than in the lines themselves .      in order to derive further constraints on the kinematics of the line emitting gas ,",
    "velocity profiles of six of the strongest emission lines were constructed , from adopting the data / continuum model ratios for each line and transposing them into velocity space , with respect to their expected lab rest frame energies , with negative values denoting blueshift . for the he - like lines ,",
    "velocity profiles were constructed for nvi , ovii and neix , which are the best defined he - like complexes ( mgxi being poorly constrained in the rgs ) . for the nvi and ovii he - like line complexes , the velocities were centered ( at zero velocity ) on the expected positions of the intercombination emission , as from the previous fits it appeared that both of these line profile centroids lie close to these transitions .",
    "in contrast , the neix profile is centered ( with zero velocity ) at the expected position of the forbidden line at 905.1ev , as also indicated in the above spectral fits .",
    "velocity profiles were also created for the h - like ( lyman-@xmath16 ) emission lines of nvii , oviii and mgxii , centered at zero velocity on the expected centroid energy of the emission line doublets ( the separation of which is unresolved in the rgs data ) .",
    "the velocity profiles of the three h - like and three he - like profiles are plotted in figure 7 .",
    "the profiles have initially been fitted with single gaussians , with the centroid position and @xmath151 width ( in velocity space ) as well as the gaussian normalization ( flux ) allowed to vary . for the he - like complexes ,",
    "the vertical ( dashed - dotted ) lines indicate the relative positions in velocity space of the resonance , intercombination and forbidden emission line components compared to the line centroids , while for the h - like profiles , the expected center position of the doublet is marked with a vertical line ( at zero velocity ) .",
    "the results of these single gaussian fits to the six line profiles are also tabulated in table 5 .",
    "the centroid emission of the h - like profiles are generally close to zero velocity and do not appear to be resolved in terms of their widths compared to the resolution of the rgs spectrometer .",
    "indeed , after correcting for the instrumental width due to the response function of the rgs , only upper - limits are obtained for the intrinsic velocity widths of the h - like nvii , oviii and mgxii lines .",
    "for instance the limit on the width of the nvii profile is @xmath169kms@xmath2 ( or fwhm , @xmath170kms@xmath2 ) , while for oviii the velocity width is restricted to @xmath171kms@xmath2 ( or fwhm , @xmath172kms@xmath2 ) ; see table 5 for details .",
    "there is an marginal indication that the line centroids are slightly blueshifted in the case of nvii and oviii ( with velocities of @xmath173kms@xmath2 and @xmath174kms@xmath2 respectively ) .",
    "there is also a hint of positive residuals on the blue - wing of the nvii line ( between @xmath175 to @xmath176kms@xmath2 ) and on the red - wing ( near @xmath177kms@xmath2 ) of the oviii profile , although neither are statistically significant .",
    "thus although we can not exclude an underlying broad component to either of these profiles , it is likely to be weak . finally for the oviii profile , there appears to be a marginally significant ( at the @xmath178 level ) absorption feature , observed at @xmath179kev and redshifted by @xmath180kms@xmath2 with respect to the oviii ly-@xmath16 centroid .",
    "however this may be spurious , as no other absorption lines are associated to any of the other profiles at a similar velocity .",
    "in contrast , the he - like profiles shown in figure 7 all appear significantly broadened when fitted with a single gaussian profile , with intrinsic @xmath151 velocity widths of between @xmath181kms@xmath2 typically ( see table5 for the corresponding fwhm values ) . in comparison",
    "the contribution of the width from the instrumental resolution of the rgs is negligible at the positions of these lines .",
    "the centroid of the gaussian profile of the nvi emission is close to that of the intercombination transitions , albeit with a small blueshift of @xmath182kms@xmath2 .",
    "likewise the ovii profile is centered at the position of the intercombination emission , with no velocity shift required , which is limited to @xmath183kms@xmath2 .",
    "note that for the broad ovii profile to be primarily associated to the forbidden line would instead require a significant blueshift of @xmath184kms@xmath2 .",
    "however there may still be some contribution of the forbidden line to the overall ovii profile , as some excess is observed near its expected position in the profile .",
    "in contrast the broad neix gaussian appears centered at the forbidden line , with any velocity shift of the profile limited to @xmath185kms@xmath2 .",
    "next , the he - like profiles were modeled using a combination of the forbidden , intercombination and resonance components , with the widths of these components limited to the instrumental rgs resolution , i.e. they are initially assumed to be intrinsically narrow and the overall he - like complex consists of a blend of these narrow lines . the fit with narrow lines to the profiles",
    "are displayed in the left hand panels of figure 8 . in the case of nvi , which is the least",
    "well determined of the three he - like line profiles , an acceptable fit to the profile of @xmath186 is obtained from the combination of three narrow components .",
    "this is comparable to the fit obtained above with a single broad profile , where @xmath187 .",
    "however in order to model the profile with 3 narrow components , a significant blueshift ( of the order @xmath175kms@xmath2 ) is required , as can be seen in panel ( a ) in figure 8 with respect to their expected positions .",
    "nonetheless , allowing the intercombination emission to have some intrinsic width does improve the fit statistic somewhat to @xmath188 , with an intrinsic width of @xmath189kms@xmath2 ( see fig 8 , panel b ) .",
    "in contrast the ovii profile is poorly modeled ( @xmath190 ) with a combination of 3 narrow lines , as is seen in figure 8(c ) , where significant flux is left unmodeled by the narrow emission lines . thus allowing a broad component ( while retaining a possible contribution from any narrow emission if required ) , results in a significant improvement in the fit statistic to @xmath191 .",
    "the line width then becomes significantly broadened as before , with the line centroid consistent with the expected position of the intercombination emission . a weak contribution from a narrow forbidden line",
    "may still be present in the model , as can be seen near @xmath192kms@xmath2 ( wrt the intercombination emission ) in figure 8(d ) , which shows the composite narrow plus broad profile .",
    "likewise , the neix line profile is also poorly modeled with a combination of three narrow line components , with @xmath193 and significant line flux is left on both the red and the blue side of the narrow forbidden line ( figure 8 , panel e ) . thus allowing the width of the forbidden line to increase results in a substantial improvement in the fit statistic to @xmath194 , while the contribution of any narrow intercombination and resonance lines are negligible ( figure 8f ) .",
    "it is also possible that the line triplets are composed of a blend of broadened emission from each of the components , i.e. with the same velocity width as might be expected if they originate from within the same zone of gas . to test this and to determine the relative contribution of the three components towards the overall broad profiles , each he - like profile",
    "was fitted with three gaussian components near the expected positions of the forbidden , intercombination and resonance emission lines .",
    "a common ( tied ) velocity width was adopted between each of the gaussians .",
    "although the subsequent three gaussian fits were statistically identical to a fit with a single broad gaussian profile as above , the results give an indication of the relative contribution of each component towards the overall profile .",
    "the results of this deconvolution are shown for each triplet in table5 .",
    "for the ovii triplet , the emission can be equally composed of contributions from the forbidden , intercombination and resonance emission .",
    "the line width is then somewhat lower than for a single broad gaussian , but is still significantly broadened , with @xmath195kms@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast the neix broad profile is dominated by the forbidden emission , which is not surprising as the overall line profile is centered very near the expected position of the forbidden line . the resulting common line width in this case",
    "is @xmath196kms@xmath2 ( table5 ) .",
    "thus for the he - like lines , the broad component appears to dominate these profiles , with any narrow line contribution representing a relatively small component of the total line flux .",
    "the high flux ratio of the intercombination to forbidden emission , for at least the nvi and ovii triplets , suggests that the electron density of the gas may be relatively high .",
    "in contrast , the velocity widths of the highest ionization h - like lines are generally narrow or unresolved , while some profiles may have a modest outflow velocity .",
    "in addition to the deep rgs exposure , a 120ks exposure was also obtained with chandra / hetg over the same time frame . given the much shorter hetg exposure and lower area at the lowest energies , the signal to noise below 1kev does not provide any additional constraints on the ovii or neix line emission .",
    "although the primary purpose of the _ chandra _ exposure was to measure the fe k profile at high resolution , the hetg does provide additional constraints on any possible emission from mg , si and s above 1kev , where in particular its higher resolution compared to the rgs makes the hetg more sensitive to any narrow components of the line emission .",
    "the most significant soft x - ray line emission detected in the hetg spectrum arises from the mgxi he - like triplet , which is shown in figure9 .",
    "indeed at this energy , the resolution of the heg spectrum is a factor @xmath197 higher compared to the rgs .",
    "significant line emission ( at @xmath198% confidence with @xmath199 ) is revealed in the heg spectrum just bluewards of the expected position of the mgxi forbidden line ( at @xmath200ev ) , with a measured rest energy of @xmath201ev ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is @xmath202ev , which is consistent with the tentative detection of the mgxi line in the rgs spectrum at lower resolution . interesting the forbidden line profile",
    "appears somewhat broadened in the _ chandra _ spectrum , compared to the heg fwhm resolution of 320kms@xmath2 at this energy .",
    "indeed the best fit line width is @xmath203ev , corresponding to a velocity width of @xmath204kms@xmath2 ( or @xmath205kms@xmath2 at fwhm ) ; see tables 4 and 5 .",
    "this is consistent with the widths of the narrow h - like components measured above in the rgs , which are largely unresolved at lower resolution ; e.g. oviii lyman-@xmath16 has a velocity width constrained to @xmath206kms@xmath2 in the rgs spectrum .",
    "thus the forbidden emission detected and resolved in the _ chandra _ spectrum appears consistent in origin with the narrow line emitting gas revealed in the rgs spectrum .",
    "curiously the mgxi line profile appears slightly blue - shifted with respect to the expected position of the forbidden line , with an overall blue - shift of @xmath207kms@xmath2 .",
    "this is also consistent with the narrow line profiles observed in the rgs , which may also have a modest blueshift ; e.g. nvii ly-@xmath16 with @xmath208kms@xmath2 or ovii ly-@xmath16 with @xmath174kms@xmath2 ( see table 5 and figure 7 ) .",
    "thus the narrow line gas may be associated to a slight outflow velocity , while the small line widths suggest that it is located further from the nucleus than for the broad line profiles .",
    "note that unlike the detection of the forbidden emission , there is no detection of emission from either the intercombination or resonance components of the mgxi line triplet ( see figure 9 ) , with upper limits of @xmath209ev and @xmath210ev on the equivalent widths respectively .",
    "this suggests that the narrow lined emission originates primarily from lower density gas ( given the dominance of the forbidden over the intercombination emission ) ; the line diagnostics from the triplets will be discussed further in section6 .    aside from at mgxi ( and also at the iron k@xmath16 line , which will be presented by nardini et al .",
    "2016 ) , there are no other significant detections of line emission in the hetg spectrum",
    ". there are some weak indications of emission associated with the forbidden lines of sixiii and sxv , although neither of these are formally significant ( with @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) , with upper limits of @xmath213ev and @xmath214ev respectively on their equivalent widths .",
    "neither are any of the h - like lines from mg , si or s detected .",
    "generally this is expected given the continuum dominated nature of ark120 , while it is the exceptionally deep rgs exposure that has enabled the detection of the soft x - ray line emission for the first time from this agn .",
    "in addition to the emission , here we place limits on any intrinsic ionized absorption towards ark120 .",
    "we included a solar abundance xstar multiplicative table of photoionized absorption spectra in the spectral model fitted to the rgs at the rest frame of the agn , while the outflow velocity was allowed to vary between @xmath215kms@xmath2 to allow for any velocity shift .",
    "a turbulence velocity of @xmath216kms@xmath2 was chosen , to account for any narrow absorption lines .",
    "the ionization parameter of the absorption table was varied between @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the ionizing luminosity measured between 11000 rydberg , @xmath219 is the electron density and @xmath220 is the radial distance from the x - ray source .",

    "the total @xmath105 column was recorded for each value of the ionization parameter , in increments of 0.1 in @xmath221 space .",
    "tight limits were placed on the total absorbing column density , of between @xmath222@xmath10 and @xmath223@xmath10 over the ionization range of @xmath224 , with a less stringent constraint towards higher ionization values ( @xmath225@xmath10 for @xmath226 ) .",
    "furthermore the limits on the total o column , over the ionization range @xmath224 ( where typically most of the absorption due to ovii and oviii is expected to occur ) , varies between @xmath227@xmath10 and @xmath228@xmath10 .",
    "indeed upon inspection of the rgs spectra ( figure 6 ) there are no apparent absorption features at positions close to the expected resonance transitions of the strongest lines in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the findings and constraints on the column density of the absorption here are consistent with those of vaughan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who published their findings from a single orbit ( 112ks rgs exposure ) xmm - newton observation taken in 2003 and whom also found no evidence for any intrinsic x - ray absorption towards ark120 .",
    "furthermore there is no known uv absorber associated with ark120 ( e.g. crenshaw et al . 1999 , crenshaw & kraemer 2001 ) .",
    "this confirms ark120 as the prototype bare seyfert 1 agn , with no known intrinsic absorption along the line of sight towards the agn .",
    "while there is no intrinsic x - ray absorption towards ark 120 ( aside from the neutral ism absorption due to the milkyway ) , the high signal to noise rgs spectrum has revealed several broad and narrow emission line profiles associated to the agn . as shown in section5 ,",
    "these broad profiles are associated with the he - like emission from nvi , ovii and neix with velocity widths in the range from 40008000kms@xmath2 ( fwhm ) .",
    "in addition , the line profile modeling in section5.3 appears to exclude the possibility of the he - like triplets being composed of purely a blend of narrow unresolved emission lines from the forbidden , intercombination and resonance components , with the intrinsic velocity widths being resolved by the rgs ( see figure 8) .",
    "in contrast the h - like profiles from nvii , oviii and mgxii are narrow , for instance for the oviii ly@xmath16 emission the upper limit on the gaussian velocity width is @xmath171kms@xmath2 .    thus while there is no direct absorption along the line of sight associated to the agn ( see also vaughan et al .",
    "2004 , matt et al .",
    "2014 ) , the fact that there is significant soft x - ray line emission associated with ark120 suggests the agn is not intrinsically bare .",
    "thus the lack of absorption may just indicate that we are viewing the agn along a preferential line of sight , with relatively little ionized gas along our direct view .",
    "the detection of narrow soft x - ray emission from many seyfert galaxies , associated with photoionized or photoexcited gas , has proven common from grating observations of obscured agn ( kinkhabwala et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the origin likely to be on scales consistent with the agn narrow line region ( nlr ) and perhaps arising from a large scale outflow .",

    "indeed another agn that bares some similarity to ark120 is the bare seyfert 1 galaxy , mrk590 . here _",
    "xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  showed no intrinsic absorption , but the presence of narrow ionized emission associated with highly ionized iron ( fexxv and fexxvi ) as well as from ionized oxygen ( oviii ) ; see longinotti et al .",
    "in addition , the extended soft x - ray emission detected in the _ chandra _ image of mrk590 implies the presence of ionized gas on larger ( kpc ) scales .",
    "the overall picture may be similar to what is observed in ark120 , namely that little ionized gas is detected along the line of sight , but evidence for photoionized gas is still seen from the circumnuclear gas out of the direct view . in ark120 , the detection of both narrow and broad lines implies the existence of soft x - ray emitting gas over a wide range of spatial scales , from the sub - pc blr gas out to the more distant nlr , with the narrow highly ionized h - like emission possibly associated to the warm scattering gas on larger scales . in the following section , we attempt to quantify the location and physical properties of the soft x - ray emitting gas in ark120 .",
    "the lack of intrinsic x - ray absorption towards ark120 allowed a clean measurement of the emission from the he - like triplets .",
    "given the constraints on the he - like line triplets , we can place an estimate on the density and subsequently infer the likely radial location of the emitting gas .",
    "the line ratios @xmath229 and @xmath230 give a measure of the temperature and density of the gas , where @xmath231 corresponds to the forbidden line , @xmath232 to the intercombination emission and @xmath233 to the resonance line ( porquet & dubau 2000 ) . taking the ratios of the fluxes of the line components measured from the ovii triplet ( table5 ) , then @xmath234 , resulting from a relatively equal contribution of the broad forbidden and intercombination components .",
    "this indicates that the gas is of relatively high density . from the calculations of porquet & dubau ( 2000 )",
    ", this ratio corresponds to an electron density of @xmath235@xmath4 . on the other hand",
    "the high g ratio , of @xmath236 , indicates that the gas being photoionized rather than collisionally ionized , with a temperature of @xmath237k .",
    "note that photoionization rather than photo - excitation appears the more dominant mechanism in ark120 , given the relative weakness of the higher order emission lines ( see fig 5 , kinkhabwala et al .",
    "2002 ) ; for instance for ovii the ratio of the he@xmath16 to he@xmath154 emission is @xmath238 .",
    "in contrast for the he - like triplet of neix , the forbidden line appears to dominate over any intercombination emission ( see table 5 ) , as generally the neix triplet is more sensitive towards higher densities compared to ovii .",
    "thus the r ratio of @xmath239 implies a limiting density of @xmath240@xmath4 .",
    "so for ark120 , the broad lined soft x - ray emitting gas appears consistent with a density in the range from @xmath241@xmath4 .",
    "the g ratio from the neix triplet is @xmath242 , consistent with a photoionized plasma .",
    "note that the constraints on @xmath243 obtained from the nvi triplet are consistent with this , with a resulting lower limit on the density of @xmath244@xmath4 .",
    "thus the above density would seem to imply an origin of the broad line emission consistent with the optical blr ( davidson & netzer 1979 ) .",
    "the ionization of the emitter can also be constrained , given the measured line flux ratio of ovii he@xmath16/oviii ly@xmath16@xmath245 , e.g. table  4 . indeed from fitting an xstar emission model with a density of @xmath246@xmath4 to model the ovii emission ( see section6.4 ) , an ionization parameter of @xmath247 is required in order for the less ionized he - like emission to dominate over the h - like emission .    from this an estimate of the radial distance of the emitter can be obtained via the definition of the ionization parameter , i.e. @xmath248 , where @xmath218 is the @xmath249rydberg luminosity and @xmath250 is the electron density . from the broad - band uv to hard x - ray sed , the ionizing luminosity of ark120 is @xmath251ergs@xmath2 ( porquet et al .",
    "if we adopt a density of @xmath246@xmath4 from the above considerations , then the emitting radius is @xmath252 cm ( or @xmath253pc ) , again consistent with typical blr radii ( kaspi et al .",
    "furthermore the distance to the optical blr , inferred from time delays of the h@xmath154 line wrt to the continuum in ark120 is @xmath254light days ( peterson & gaskell 1991 , wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) , equivalent to a distance of @xmath255 cm . the radius of the emission can also be estimated from the ovii or neix velocity widths of @xmath256kms@xmath2 or a fwhm of @xmath1kms@xmath2 , adopting the more conservative lower value from the triplet deconstruction ( see table 5 ) . assuming a standard virial relation between the black hole mass and the radius @xmath220 , of @xmath257 and adopting a black hole mass of @xmath258   for ark120 from reverberation mapping ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , gives a radius of @xmath259 cm , consistent with the above estimates .    in comparison",
    "the optical h@xmath154 fwhm line width of ark120 is @xmath260kms@xmath2 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) , which is similar to ( or slightly smaller ) than the typical x - ray broad line widths measured here .",
    "furthermore the core of the 6.4kev iron k@xmath16 emission line is also resolved in the simultaneous chandra / hetg spectrum , with a fwhm width of @xmath261kms@xmath2 ( nardini et al .",
    "2016 ) , consistent with the above estimates .",
    "thus the observations suggest that the soft x - ray broad emission lines originating from a higher ionization phase of the agn blr , with radii in the typical range from @xmath262 cm .",
    "in contrast the h - like profiles measured in the spectra from n , o and mg appear narrow and are unresolved by the rgs ",
    "see figure 7 and table 5 .",
    "the constraints on the density of the narrow lined emitting gas are not as tight as for the broad lines , with the mgxi triplet measured from _",
    "( forbidden dominating over intercombination with @xmath263 ) indicating @xmath264@xmath4 .",
    "thus although we can not directly measure the density of the narrow line emitting gas from line diagnostics , we can calculate its likely radial location from the limits on the velocity widths . if we take the line width for the resolved mgxi forbidden line from the _ chandra _ spectrum , with @xmath265kms@xmath2 , then the likely radius of the emitting gas is on pc scales .",
    "note this is also consistent with the limits on the widths of the narrow lines seen in the rgs , e.g. for the oviii ly@xmath16 line then @xmath171kms@xmath2 . for comparison ,",
    "the expected distances of the torus and of the narrow line region ( nlr ) are about 3pc and 100pc , using the following formula of krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) and mor , netzer & elitzur ( 2009 ) respectively :    @xmath266    @xmath267    thus , unlike for the broad line emitting gas , the narrow line x - ray emission appears consistent with radial locations commensurate with the pc scale torus or innermost nlr .",
    "this is also at a similar location to some of the soft x - ray warm absorbers inferred in seyfert 1 agn ( see tombesi et al . 2013 and references therein ) , which may imply that we are viewing similar ionized gas in ark120 out of our direct line of sight .",
    "the luminosity of the soft x - ray line emission can also be used to calculate the global covering factor of the gas ( see also nucita et al .",
    "2010 ) . from the photoionization modeling , the normalization ( or flux ) ,",
    "@xmath268 , of an emission component is defined by xstar ( kallman et al . 2004 ) in terms of : @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the ionizing luminosity in units of @xmath271ergs@xmath2 , @xmath272 is the distance to the agn in kpc .",
    "here @xmath273 is the covering fraction of the gas with respect to the total solid angle , where @xmath274 . for a spherical shell of gas , @xmath275 , while @xmath276 is the quasar ionizing luminosity that illuminates the photoionized shell .",
    "the ionizing luminosity obtained from the best fit spectral model and corrected for the intervening galactic absorption , is @xmath277ergs@xmath2 over the 11000rydberg bandergs@xmath2 . ] .",
    "thus for ark120 with @xmath278mpc and for a spherical shell , the expected xstar normalization from above is @xmath279 .",
    "hence for a given column density of gas , this sets the total luminosity of the soft x - ray photoionized emission .",
    "as a first step , model emission line spectra were then generated with this overall normalization factor within xstar , which gives the predicted emission originating from a fully covering spherical shell of gas ( with @xmath275 ) , illuminated by an agn ionizing luminosity of @xmath276 .",
    "the ionization of the gas was fixed at @xmath247 , consistent with the xstar fits to the lines ( see below ) . taking as an example the case of the strong ovii he@xmath16 broad emission line observed in the rgs spectrum , we then compared the observed line luminosity to that predicted by the xstar model and then used the ratio of the observed to predicted line luminosity to calculate the global covering fraction of the gas . from the ark120 spectrum , the observed luminosity of the broad ovii emission is @xmath280ergs@xmath2 . in comparison , for a column density of @xmath281@xmath10 ,",
    "the ovii luminosity predicted by the xstar model for a fully covering shell of gas is @xmath282ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of the observed to predicted luminosity then gives the geometric covering fraction of the emitter , which for @xmath281@xmath10 is @xmath283 .",
    "similarly , for a higher column of @xmath284@xmath10 , the predicted ovii luminosity of a spherical shell is higher , with @xmath285ergs@xmath2 and thus the covering fraction is then lower , with @xmath286 .    to provide a more quantitative estimate of the covering fraction , the rgs spectrum",
    "was then fitted with the xstar emission models . in order to reproduce the strongest emission lines present in the ark120 spectrum ,",
    "three different photoionized emission zones were required and their properties are summarized in table6 .",
    "two of these emission zones appear to be broadened ( with @xmath287kms@xmath2 ) ; these are required to model ( i ) the broad ovii emission ( as well as at nvi ) and ( ii ) the broad neix emission , with the lower ionization zone ( with @xmath288 ) responsible for ovii .",
    "a third , highest ionization zone ( @xmath289 ) with a narrow velocity width ( @xmath216kms@xmath2 ) is responsible for the narrow h - like lines , such as from oviii ly-@xmath16 .",
    "the column density of the gas in emission is not known a priori ( due to the lack of absorbing gas ) and is highly degenerate with the emission normalization . thus instead of directly fitting both the column and the normalization of the xstar emission zones , the column density was varied over the range @xmath290@xmath10 , adopting 8 different values and at each fixed @xmath105 value",
    "the spectrum was refitted to obtain the normalization of the xstar component .",
    "thus by comparing the observed normalization ( @xmath291 ) of a fitted emission component with the predicted value from equation3 ( @xmath268 ) , the covering fraction for a given column can be calculated by @xmath292 .",
    "the resulting plot of covering fraction vs. column for the ovii emission zone is shown in figure10 , noting that similar results are also found for the neix zone and the ( narrow ) oviii zone ( see table 6 ) .",
    "the overall trend is for the covering fraction of the gas to decrease with increasing column .",
    "this would be expected as increasing the column density of the gas clouds increases their soft x - ray luminosity , requiring the overall covering fraction to decrease in order to compensate . a minimum column density of @xmath293@xmath10",
    "is required to reproduce the required ovii luminosity , if the gas is fully covering the agn with @xmath275 .",
    "this fully covering scenario appears less likely , as the upper - limit to the line of sight column of soft x - ray warm absorbing gas towards ark120 is at least factor of @xmath100 lower ; with @xmath294@xmath10 for @xmath295 , see section 5.5 .",
    "instead the covering fraction is likely to be lower , with no significant distribution of gas along the line of sight , allowing the column density out of the direct line of sight to be higher .",
    "indeed once the column density approaches @xmath284@xmath10 , then the covering reaches a limiting value of @xmath296 .",
    "this corresponds to a likely _ minimum _ covering fraction of gas as increasing the column density above @xmath297@xmath10 has little effect on the total line luminosity ; i.e at these columns and higher , the emitting clouds become optically thick at soft x - rays , with little change in the resulting soft x - ray line luminosity .      thus the above calculations , in order to reproduce the broad soft x - ray line emission , requires the emitting gas to have a typical column of up to @xmath298@xmath10 , with a covering fraction of at least 10% of @xmath5 steradian and for the gas to lie out of the direct line of sight .",
    "the mass of the emitting gas implied from these calculations is @xmath299m@xmath15 , for @xmath284@xmath10 and @xmath296 .",
    "overall this scenario is similar to what is usually inferred from studies of the optical  uv blr ( baldwin et al .",
    "1995 , gaskell 2009 ) , with the distribution of emitting blr clouds likely non - spherical and following a flattened or disk - like geometry ( krolik et al .",
    "1991 , eracleous & halpern 2003 ) .",
    "the latter distribution of emitting clouds can also account for the lack of absorption towards ark120 if the gas lies out of the direct line of sight and our view of the agn is relatively pole - on compared to the plane of the disk .",
    "this may also be consistent with the morphology of the host spiral galaxy being relatively pole - on in ark120 ( nordgren et al .",
    "the opposite may be the case in agn where variable x - ray obscuration events occur , when the line of sight can be intercepted by compact clouds consistent with observed blr distances .",
    "such x - ray obscuration events have been observed several seyfert galaxies , such as in mrk 335 ( longinotti et al . 2013 ) , ngc 3227 ( lamer et al .",
    "2003 ) , ngc 1365 ( risaliti et al . 2005b , braito et al .",
    "2014 ) , ngc 4051 ( terashima et al .",
    "2009 , lobban et al .",
    "2011 ) , ngc3516 ( turner et al . 2008 ) and ngc 5548 ( kaastra et al . 2014 ) .",
    "in contrast to the broadened emission , the kinematics of the narrow soft x - ray emission lines are consistent with arising from pc scale distances or higher . the typical column density and covering fraction of the narrow emission line gas",
    "is similar to broad lined gas ; for a column of @xmath300@xmath10 , the covering fraction is consistent with @xmath275 , while the covering fraction decreases to @xmath47% for @xmath301@xmath10 .",
    "thus the derived columns and covering fractions are thus likely too low to be commensurate with emission from a compton thick pc - scale torus .",
    "however the origin of the gas in emission may arise from the agn narrow lined region ( nlr ) and is in general agreement with the typical columns and spatial locations of matter inferred along the line of sight in the warm absorbers that are observed in many other seyfert 1 agn ( e.g. mrk 509 , kaastra et al . 2012 ) .",
    "indeed the kinematics of the narrow emission lines , in terms of the velocity widths and a tentative indication of modest blueshift ( both of the order of a few hundred kms@xmath2 ) , may imply we are observing emission from a pc scale outflow , but viewed out of the line of sight towards ark120 .",
