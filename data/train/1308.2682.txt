    "synthetic photometry is used to scale the spectra to match the sdss @xmath24band image of each field .",

    "we typically achieve a s / n of @xmath32 per pixel at a surface brightness brighter than @xmath33 mag arcsec@xmath34 .",
    "as discussed in detail in paper i , we will use lick indices as a tool to trace the stellar populations , rather than full spectral synthesis models , given both the imperfect flux calibration of our data and the difficulty in modeling the effects of abundance ratio changes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) self - consistently ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "in particular , the emission from h@xmath35  is weak in all cases , but even a 0.1    error in the h@xmath35  ew can lead to errors of @xmath22 gyr in the modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .        in paper",
    "i , we utilized ppxf+gandalf developed by m. sarzi @xcite and m. cappellari @xcite to simultaneously model the stellar absorption and emission lines . here ,",
    "instead , we fit each spectrum with an empirical template drawn from the composite spectra of @xcite .",
    "we then fit the [ ]  emission in the residual spectrum , and subtract both [ ]  and h@xmath35 , assuming that the h@xmath35  emission is 70% of the [ ]  flux ( good to within a factor of two , * ? ? ?",

    "we found that our gandalf results were sensitive to template mismatch , and so adopted this iterative approach that gives us more control over the templates but less control over the line strengths .",

    "there is no net offset between the two sets of indices in any case , with @xmath39 .",
    "h@xmath35  and @xmath40fe@xmath41 each have a scatter of @xmath26 while mg@xmath9  and the g - band each have a scatter of @xmath42 .",
    "as in paper i , we use the stellar population modeling code _ ez_ages _ @xcite to convert the lick indices from the composite spectra to physical parameters ( age , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath6/fe ] ) .",
    "the code works on a hierarchy of index pairs , starting with h@xmath35  and @xmath43 , and iteratively solves for the age , abundance and abundance ratios .",
    "the models of @xcite include abundance ratio differences using the methodology of @xcite and the response functions of @xcite . in our default runs , we utilize the @xmath6-enhanced isochrone from @xcite and the default assumption that [ o / fe]@xmath44 .",
    "we revisit this final assumption in  [ sec : dstarform ] .",
    "our error budget is dominated by small errors in sky subtraction , particularly when sky lines fall within the bands of the lick index measurements .",
    "thus , for each extracted spectrum , we generate eight perturbed spectra with the fiducial sky subtraction scaled by @xmath45 respectively .",
    "we then run our entire procedure on these perturbed spectra .",
    "the final errors represent the spread in ews produced by these variations in sky subtraction .",
    "as described in paper i , our sky subtraction uncertainty is unlikely to exceed 3% , so these error bars are conservative .    in paper",
    "i , all of our targeted galaxies had similar sizes and distances .",
    "therefore , at a given radial distance , we achieved similar quality spectra for all galaxies . in this sample",
    "we span a much wider range in galaxy stellar mass , and reach our limiting surface brightness at different radii for each galaxy . at a certain point , the lick index measurements are no longer reliable . to ensure some consistency across all galaxies ,",
    "we do not consider lick index measurements from spectra with s / n per pixel @xmath46 .",
    "while measuring lick indices is a very powerful technique at high s / n , at the large radii that we are working systematic effects such as small errors in sky subtraction and flux calibration can cause large uncertainties in the lick indices measured from individual objects . with our sample size",
    ", we benefit from averaging over multiple galaxies at each radial bin .",
    "the composite spectra will suffer less from the vagaries of sky subtraction and flux calibration , which occur at different wavelengths in each galaxy rest - frame ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we are able to examine radial variations in the composite spectra at the percent level .",
    "we first divide the galaxies into three bins of central @xmath0  of @xmath47@xmath0@xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath0@xmath50 , and @xmath51 @xmath0@xmath52  km  s@xmath2 , since we know that the stellar population properties are a strong function of @xmath0(e.g .",

    "note that the bins would not change if we used @xmath0  within @xmath11 , but that in this way our bins are more consistent with the large literature based on the sdss measurements .",
    "we combine spectra that have already been emission - line  corrected .",
    "we interpolate the rest - frame spectra onto the same wavelength grid and then smooth each galaxy to the highest dispersion in the stack ( @xmath53  km  s@xmath2  for the high - dispersion bin and 200  km  s@xmath2  for the low - dispersion bin ) .",
    "however , to increase the contrast , we will focus exclusively on the highest and lowest dispersion bins here .",
    "we remove the continuum by dividing each spectrum by a heavily smoothed version of itself .",
    "this step simultaneously normalizes all spectra to the same level and ensures that differences in continuum shape ( whether real or due to small errors in sky subtraction or flux calibration ) do not impact the final line strengths .",
    "we then combine all pixels at each wavelength using the biweight estimator , which should be robust even with limited statistics @xcite .",
    "we experiment with multiplying the composite spectrum by the median continuum before measuring indices , but the changes to the lick indices are negligible in all cases .",
    "the composite spectra are shown in figure [ fig : coadd ] .",
    "again we focus only the lowest and highest - dispersion bins , which contain 11 galaxies each ( excluding ngc 219 due to severe night sky contamination and ngc 6482 due to contamination from a neighboring galaxy ) .",
    "the spectra are strikingly similar as a function of radius , so we use ratio spectra to highlight the percent level radial variations ( figure [ fig : coadd ] , right ) .",
    "specifically , we divide each composite spectrum , at each radial position , by the composite spectrum at 0.5 - 1 @xmath11 .",
    "we choose this radius , rather than the central bin , because as we will see below the largest variance in spectral properties occurs in the very center .",
    "we will examine the radial trends in these spectra in detail in ",
    "[ sec : radial ] . for",
    "now , we note only that the strongest variations are seen in carbon , mg@xmath9 , and perhaps nitrogen .",
    "to determine the level of variation in the composite spectra , we generate 100 trial composite spectra by randomly drawing from the total list of galaxies within that @xmath0  bin , with replacement .",
    "we measure lick indices from each of these 100 trial spectra .",
    "we then assign errors on the lick indices measured from the stack derived to enclose 68% of the lick indices measured from the 100 trials .",
    "we have extracted spectra out to 2.5@xmath11 for a sample of 33 local massive elliptical galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions ranging from @xmath54  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we use the composite spectra to measure high fidelity radial trends in the stellar population properties , including age , [ fe / h ] , and detailed abundance ratio gradients . from the gradients , we make inferences about when , where , and how the stars in the outer parts were formed .",
    "first , we confirm that we can recover reliable lick indices from our composite spectra (  [ sec : lickrad ] ) .",
    "second , we look at the dominant radial trends as revealed in ratios of the composite spectra (  [ sec : coaddrad ] ) .",
    "third , and finally , we present the radial trends in stellar populations (  [ sec : coadd_stellarpop ] ) .",
    "we first investigate the average radial profile in the lick indices as a function of radius in the high - dispersion ( @xmath51@xmath0@xmath52  km  s@xmath2 ) and low - dispersion ( @xmath47@xmath0@xmath55  km  s@xmath2 ) galaxies .",
    "we use lick indices measured from the composite spectra (  [ sec : composite ] ) and plot them as filled points as a function of radius in figure [ fig : radial ] . as a check on the composite spectra",

    "these median profiles are shown as lines in figure [ fig : radial ] .",
    "the consistency between the composite and median measurements gives us confidence in the measurements from our composite spectra .",
    "we show radial profiles both as a function of radius scaled to @xmath11 and in physical units of kpc .",
    "using bins scaled to the effective radius is convenient when comparing galaxies of varying size .",
    "however , there are two problems with using @xmath11-normalized units .",
    "first , @xmath11 is difficult to measure , and becomes more so for high - mass galaxies that have an extended low surface - brightness halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , @xmath11 grows with cosmic time .",
    "therefore , if we are searching for changes in stellar populations that correspond to different epochs in galaxy growth , we may want to look at physical as well as @xmath11-scaled radii .",
    "interestingly , most of the variation in the lick indices occurs within the central @xmath56 kpc or @xmath57 . from photometric",
    "fitting , @xcite find evidence for a distinct outer ( @xmath4 kpc ) component , perhaps formed via accretion .",
    "we see a tantalizing hint that the index values are converging beyond @xmath12 between the low- and high - dispersion galaxies . if indeed the central compact regions of elliptical galaxies were formed in a very rapid event at high redshift , with the outer parts accreted later ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we might be reaching a radius where a large fraction of the mass has been accreted from smaller galaxies .",
    "as our next means of studying radial stellar population trends , we examine the stacked spectra as a function of radius .",
    "in addition to measuring more reliable lick indices at large radius , we examine percent - level variations directly from the stacked spectra . while we do not derive any quantitative conclusions from this exercise , it is nevertheless revealing to see where the largest radial variance occurs in the spectra .",
    "we create composite spectra for two groups of galaxies divided by high ( @xmath0@xmath58  km  s@xmath2 ) and low ( @xmath0@xmath59  km  s@xmath2 ) stellar velocity dispersion , and we add them radially in units of @xmath11 ( fig . [",

    "[ fig : coaddphys ] ) . since the largest variations occur within the central bin , we have made ratio spectra (  [ sec : composite ] ) dividing by the composite spectrum in the @xmath60 or the @xmath61 kpc bin respectively .",

    "the strong radial decrease in the c@xmath63 , cn , and mgh molecular bands reflects the decreasing [ z / h ] . at lower metallicity molecules",
    "do not form as effectively . however , as we show below , we also find compelling evidence for true abundance ratio gradients as a function of radius , particularly in [ c / fe ] .",

    "in contrast , if stars at large radius were accreted from smaller systems that formed their stars rapidly and early ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect stars in the outskirts to be uniformly old , @xmath6-enhanced , and metal - poor , as we find for our galaxies .",
    "we note three caveats in interpreting the more detailed abundance ratios , such as [ c / fe ] .",
    "first , our cn measurements are potentially problematic , due to the steep continuum shape around the 4000break and the difficulties of accurate flux calibration and sky subtraction at the blue edge of our spectra . the [ n / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] abundances , because they depend on both cn and the c@xmath63 measurements , are both impacted by the uncertainty in measuring cn . however",
    ", the cn index measured from our central spectra shows no systematic offset from the cn index measured from the sdss spectra , with ( cn@xmath68 - cn@xmath69)/cn@xmath70 .",
    "this agreement gives us confidence that our cn index measurement is not driven by systematics in our reductions .",
    "second , we do not directly model [ o / fe ] , but the assumed oxygen abundance directly impacts the [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] values @xcite . because most of the c is locked up in co , a slightly supersolar [ c / o ] leads to a large increase in the strength of the c@xmath63 swan bands ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to bracket the uncertainty in [ o / fe ] , we run a second set of stellar population models with [ o / fe]@xmath71 ( rather than the default [ o / fe]@xmath44 ; dotted lines in fig . [",
    "fig : radialagefeafe ] ) .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that as an @xmath6  element [ o / fe ] tracks [ mg / fe ] , as has been seen in recent studies of elliptical galaxy centers .",
    "@xcite model oxygen abundance in sdss galaxies using full spectral fitting and find that the o / mg ratio is constant to within 0.05 dex .",
    "likewise , @xcite find o / mg@xmath72 for all @xmath0 .",
    "thus , adopting a range of [ o / mg ] spanning @xmath73 dex should bracket the range of allowed [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , and [ ca / fe ] .",
    "figure [ fig : radialagefeafe ] shows that as expected , only [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] are strongly impacted by different values of [ o / fe ] . at lower [ o / fe ] , the absolute value of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] are both correspondingly lower , and we note that a value of [ n / fe]@xmath74 dex is consistent with values reported for the most massive sdss galaxies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the radial behavior of c and n relative to each other are not impacted by the overall o abundance .",
    "third , we note that the models do not include carbon stars @xcite .",
    "however , the incidence of carbon stars is low at the metallicities considered here , and then increases strongly at yet lower metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we do not believe carbon stars can be dominating the observed [ c / fe ] trends .",
    "we find that stellar population gradients are strongest within @xmath75 , while at larger radius the gradients begin to flatten .",
    "furthermore , the differences between the high- and low - dispersion galaxies in terms of age and @xmath6-abundance decrease with @xmath67 ; at all dispersions , stars at large radius are old , @xmath6-enhanced , and relatively metal poor .",
    "note that we include s0s in this analysis ; we do not yet have a large enough sample to separate them , but will do so in future work .",
    "finally , we infer strong negative gradients in [ c / fe ] with radius , while the [ n / fe ] abundances are high ( at least [ n / fe]@xmath74 ) and flat .",
    "we now discuss the ramifications of our results for the formation histories of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "if elliptical galaxies are built from the inside - out , with an early dissipational phase making a compact ( @xmath22 kpc ) central component followed by late - time accretion of satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect to see the imprint of that process in the stellar populations as a function of radius .",
    "the detailed stellar population properties provide clues about when the stars formed , how quickly they were formed , and the depth of the potential well that they formed in .      each stellar population property shown in figure",
    "[ fig : radialagefeafe ] tells us something about the provenance of these stars .",
    "the stellar age obviously provides one important clue .",
    "the metallicity presumably maps onto the depth of the potential well in which the star formed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , [ @xmath6/fe ] and the more detailed abundance ratios we consider here reflect how rapidly the stellar population was formed .",
    "high [ @xmath6/fe ] indicates a preponderance of type ii supernova relative to type ia , and thus rapid formation timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , although their origins are less clear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] provide complementary information about star formation timescales , as they are likely produced at least partially in intermediate - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to a large extent , the stellar populations in the centers of elliptical galaxies scale with the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "luminosity - weighted mean age , total metallicity [ z / h ] and formation timescale [ @xmath6/fe ] all correlate with @xmath0(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the more detailed abundance ratio patterns are likewise monotonic functions of @xmath0  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we discussed in paper i , the stars at large radius do not share the detailed stellar population properties of the stars at the center of any present - day galaxy .",
    "the stellar ages are old and [ fe / h ] is 0.3 - 0.4 dex subsolar . however , despite the low metallicity , the [ @xmath6/fe ] abundance ratios are high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "the low [ fe / h ]  values are best explained by formation in shallow potential wells , either of small galaxies as advocated in the two - phase model of galaxy formation , or the outer parts of big galaxies .",
    "however , given the old ages and high [ @xmath6/fe ] ratios , these stars must have formed early and over short timescales . to estimate how rapidly , we adopt the scaling from @xcite between [ @xmath6/fe ] and star formation timescale , which is based on a simple closed - box model . assuming that [ o / fe ] tracks [ mg / fe ] , we find a timescale of 250 myr for [ mg / fe]@xmath76 .",
    "likewise , the ratio of c / n apparently falls at large radius , while it remains constant in the centers of elliptical galaxies . as we argued above ,",
    "while the absolute values of carbon and nitrogen are uncertain due to the unknown [ o / fe ] , their ratio as a function of radius should be robust .",
    "we will first discuss the radial behavior of [ c / fe ] , and then turn to the more puzzling [ n / fe ] trends .",
    "carbon is made in the triple alpha process in intermediate mass ( @xmath77  @xmath78 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stars .",
    "massive , metal - rich stars also release significant c through stellar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rising [ c / fe ] seen in the centers of massive elliptical galaxies , where the star formation timescales are short , seems to require that a significant fraction of the carbon actually is made in massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "carbon from massive stars is also needed to explain the correlation between the c / o and o / h ratios observed in  regions and individual milky way stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yield calculations find that massive metal - rich stars can provide enough carbon to explain the galactic observations @xcite .",
    "based on their high [ @xmath6/fe ] , stars at large radius were likely formed rapidly , so the declining [ c / fe ] presumably reflects the declining carbon yields from lower - metallicity massive stars , and supports our inference of rapid star formation timescales .",
    "nitrogen is more complicated .",
    "we must explain both the very super - solar [ n / fe ] values that we observe ( at least [ n / fe]@xmath79 ) and the falling c / n with radius .",
    "nitrogen is produced in intermediate - mass stars as part of the cno cycle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but c is required before n can be produced .",
    "the c is either synthesized in the star through the triple alpha process ( `` primary '' ) or present in the star to begin with ( `` secondary '' ) . while some primary n is required from low - metallicity massive stars to explain the floor in n abundances seen in regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the yields from massive stars alone are not high enough to produce the super - solar enrichment that we observe .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , high [ n / fe ] ratios then provide a lower limit on the star formation timescale of at least a few myr , the lifetimes of intermediate - mass stars",
    ". therefore , the star formation timescales inferred from [ @xmath6/fe ] of 250 myr are consistent with the timescales required by [ n / fe ] .",
    "since synthesizing n requires existing c @xcite , it is possible that the high [ n / fe ] results from the supersolar [ c / fe ] .",
    "however , we would not expect [ n / fe ] to remain high at large radius where [ c / fe ] is falling .",
    "longer star formation timescales could provide higher [ n / fe ] ratios , but presumably would flatten [ c / fe ] as well .",
    "it could be that n is more effectively released by lower metallicity stars , although we do not have a proposed mechanism here . a changing imf , in particular a bottom - heavy imf as have been invoked for the most massive elliptical galaxies @xcite can not help , since the c is made by massive stars .",
    "we do note that the nucleosynthis of n is a puzzle in globular clusters as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it may be that these problems have a similar solution .",
    "intriguingly , an ultra - compact dwarf in virgo recently discussed by @xcite also appears to have solar carbon abundances but supersolar [ n / fe]@xmath80 dex , perhaps providing an additional link between small stripped galaxies and elliptical stellar halos .",
    "finally , there is always the possibility that our [ n / fe ] values are biased high due to uncertainties in the cn measurements , although as mentioned above , we find no systematic differences between our measurements and the sdss measurements .",
    "we have no clean explanation for the observed radial decrease in c / n .",
    "the conclusions for galaxy assembly are as follows .",
    "we have seen that stellar populations at radii @xmath12 do not look like those found at the centers of _ any _ elliptical galaxies today ( paper i , and this work ) . according to our stellar population modeling ,",
    "stars at @xmath81 are similar at all @xmath0  ( see how they converge at large radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : afe_feh ] ) .",
    "the typical star is old ( @xmath4 gyr ) , relatively metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) , and @xmath6-enhanced ( [ mg / fe]@xmath7 ) . we infer that stars at large radius are formed at @xmath8 in shallow potential wells over @xmath82 myr timescales . declining [ c / fe ] ratios support this picture : with rapid star formation timescales , the declining c yields from massive stars at low - metallicity leads to a decline in this ratio with radius . on the other hand , the high and flat [ n / fe ]",
    "ratios are unexpected , but possibly also seen in stripped dwarf galaxies .      given our observed radial trends in stellar population properties , we return to the assembly history of massive elliptical galaxies . based on the striking average size growth of elliptical galaxies between redshift two and the present ,",
    "numerous papers have proposed a two - phase model for their growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our observations are consistent with this picture .",
    "the stars are converging towards similar properties at large radius independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the stellar populations at large radius demand that the accreted galaxies must be small ( to explain the low [ fe / h ] ) and form early and rapidly ( to explain the old ages and high [ @xmath6/fe ] ) .",
    "simulations make similar predictions @xcite .",
    "while the stars in the outskirts of massive ellipticals do not resemble the centers of any elliptical galaxies today , there must be present - day stars with similar metallicities and abundance patterns that did not end up in massive elliptical galaxy outskirts . in figure",
    "[ fig : afe_feh ] , we show that the average star in the outskirts of our ellipticals resembles thick - disk milky way stars . perhaps the notion of a thick disk is outdated .",
    "instead , we can say that stars in elliptical galaxy outskirts are similar to the luminosity weighted mean star in the milky way disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bovy private communication ) .",
    "since stars form in disks , and low - density disks are easier to disrupt than centrally concentrated ellipticals , we suggest that the outer parts of our elliptical galaxies were built by the shredding of disky galaxies at early times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    based on the stellar populations , similar stars , formed at @xmath83 in disks but never accreted by a more massive halo , form the thick disk components of present - day spiral galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : afe_feh ] ) .",
    "our observations are thus consistent with a two - phase model for elliptical galaxy growth",
    ".    on the other hand , our observations alone do not require such a model .",
    "instead , the average size growth in the elliptical galaxy population may occur as larger galaxies join the red sequence at later times @xcite , consistent with the observation that at a given velocity dispersion , more diffuse galaxies quenched later @xcite .",
    "if stars are formed in situ at large radius , followed by global star formation quenching , then we might expect stellar population gradients as predicted by classic monolithic collapse models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "monolithic collapse naively predicts very steep metallicity gradients as a function of radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the shallower observed [ fe / h ]  gradients , as well as flat [ @xmath6/fe ] gradients , can be reproduced in monolithic scenarios by varying the star formation efficiency and gas inflow rate @xcite . in situ formation at large radius also more naturally explains the observation that mg@xmath9  ew correlates strongly with local escape velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both assembly paths ( two - phase and all in situ ) likely occur in nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the future ,",
    "we hope that combining our stellar population measurements with kinematics may provide further clues to the level of dissipation involved in forming stars at large radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we will grow more sensitive to any such trends as our survey continues ( raskutti et al . in preparation ) .",
    "eventually , we would like to examine the radial behavior of elliptical galaxies as a function of their fundamental plane location ( or compactness ) as in @xcite .",
    "in the meantime , we can look at one spectacular outlier in our sample : ngc1270 .",
    "this galaxy has a half - light radius of @xmath22  kpc , and a central stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath84  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite highlight ngc 1277 as the prototype of these compact high - dispersion galaxies , which also appear to contain very massive ( @xmath85  @xmath78 ) supermassive black holes .",
    "van den bosch and collaborators have found a handful of galaxies like ngc 1277 , including ngc 1270 ( for low - mass versions see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have disky light profiles and are rotationally dominated at large radius .",
    "ngc 1270 appears to be an extreme example of a compact galaxy that formed at high redshift , and then grew no more .",
    "with a central age of @xmath86 gyr , it is one of the oldest galaxies in the sample ( paper i ) , has a very high central mg@xmath9  ew , and shows no gradients as a function of radius ( @xmath65 log age/@xmath65 log @xmath87 ) . as far as we can tell , ngc 1270 follows the mg@xmath9-@xmath0  relation ( paper i ) but the statistics are very limited for velocity dispersions so high .",
    "based on color gradients and spectroscopy respectively , ngc 1277 and sdss j151741.75@xmath88004217.6 also seem to fit this picture @xcite .",
    "we will look in more detail at the stellar population gradients for a larger set of the entire van den bosch sample ( yildrim et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we have presented stellar population information as a function of radius for 33 massive elliptical galaxies with stellar dispersions @xmath0@xmath89  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the well - known gentle decline in [ fe / h ]  with radius , we find that the @xmath6-abundance ratios , as traced by [ mg / fe ] , are constant with radius ( even perhaps rising slightly at @xmath0@xmath48  km  s@xmath2 ) , implying rapid star formation timescales at all radii .",
    "the declining [ c / fe ] radial trends , we believe , reflect declining carbon yields from metal - poor massive stars , in line with the rapid star formation timescales .",
    "however , we do not have a complete understanding of the rising n / c ratio that we observe in the outer parts .",
    "at large radius , the stellar populations of the stars depend very weakly on central @xmath0 ; in general they have [ fe / h]@xmath90 , [ mg / fe]@xmath7 , and age@xmath91 gyr .",
    "these are properties akin to stars in our own milky way thick disk , lending credence to the idea that the outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies comprise shredded disky galaxies whose star formation was truncated at @xmath8 .",
    "the one very compact galaxy in our sample has old ages and no abundance ratio gradients , apparently because it never accreted any gas or stars at late times .",
    "we should note that we only reach @xmath92 in this study .",
    "there is evidence from a small number of integrated light studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and resolved studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the stellar populations may change more dramatically at yet larger radius . in the case of coccato",

    ". it is still extremely observationally challenging to reach such large radius for more than a handful of targets .    in the short term , we are in the process of doubling the current sample . with a larger sample ,",
    "we hope to use the combination of stellar populations and kinematics to pin down the formation paths of individual elliptical galaxies . to derive meaningful stellar population measurements out to @xmath93 for individual galaxies we will utilize full spectral synthesis models with @xmath6  dependence , to mitigate sensitivity to systematics such as sky subtraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
