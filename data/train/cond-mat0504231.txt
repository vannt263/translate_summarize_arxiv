    "the transition temperature of a thin superconducting film in contact with a normal metal is reduced .",
    "this is known as the superconducting proximity effect ( spe ) .",
    "the double layer sn or a multi layer ( sn)@xmath4 can consist ( i ) of a superconductor s and normal conductor n or ( ii ) of two superconductors with different transition temperatures ( the one with the lower @xmath5 is generally denoted as n ) . its systematic experimental investigation started in 1960 s by the hilsch group in goettingen @xcite , @xcite and stimulated a number of further experimental investigations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the dirty case ( mean free path of the conduction electrons is much smaller than the coherence length ) werthamer @xcite derived a set of implicit equations for the transition temperature of double layers consisting of two superconductors .",
    "after some modification according to de gennes boundary condition @xcite between the superconductors , the wertheimer theory described the experimental results for double layers of two superconductors quite well ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the wertheimer theory is restricted to short mean free path , ( using the diffusion approximation ) and uses what is now called the single mode approximation ( the gap function is approaximated by a @xmath6-dependence ) .",
    "theoretical results for the clean case where the mean free path @xmath0 is larger than the bcs coherence length @xmath7 are more difficult and the case where @xmath8 and the film thicknesses are of the same order of magnitude are much more challenging .    in recent years",
    "the superconducting proximity effect has experienced a renewed interest .",
    "a large number of papers studied the spe theoretically @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and experimentally @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite particularly during the last 10 years .",
    "the studies have been extended to double layers of a superconductor and a ferromagnet ( sf ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently our group revisited the superconducting proximity effect using it as an experimental tool @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one interesting information the spe provides is the transparency of the interface between the two metal films for the conduction electrons .",
    "the reduction of @xmath5 in the superconducting component of the sn double layer depends on the rate at which electrons can cross the interface between s and n. this interface transparency is of interest in a number of other disciplines and applications in solid state physics .    when our group tried to compare the experimental results for the transition temperature with theoretical predictions we found that only a few recent theoretical investigations calculated the transition temperature of sn double layers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these papers considered the extreme cases , either the clean limit for infinitely large mean free path @xcite  or the dirty limit @xcite where the mean free path is much shorter than the bcs coherence length .",
    "reference @xcite considered superconductor - ferromagnet double layers in the `` dirty limit '' .",
    "it includes the case of an sn double layer by setting the exchange energy in the ferromagnet equal to zero .",
    "a multi - mode expansion of the order parameter is used in the superconductor .",
    "this yields a complex set of equations which contain the transition temperature implicitely .",
    "their single mode approximation is similar to wertheimers result .    since our experiments used films with short and large mean free paths the author prefered to develop a numerical procedure which is capable of calculating the transition temperature of arbitrary sequences of superconductors and normal conductors in a wide range of the mean free path .",
    "this calculation uses a simple interpretation of the gap equation which was stimulated by degennes work @xcite .",
    "below i will sketch the ( simple ) numerical procedure . in chapter",
    "ii the theoretical background is reviewed and the numerical procedure discussed in detail . in chapter",
    "iii some of the numerical results are presented . in the discussion of chapter iv",
    "i will point out a discrepancy between all experiments i am aware of which study the change of @xmath5 of a superconducting film when covered with a thin normal conducting film , i.e. the normalized intial slope @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the thickness and transition tmperature of the superconductor and @xmath12 is the initial slope of the @xmath5-reduction for zero thickness @xmath13 of the normal conductor .",
    "the superconducting phase transition in zero magnetic field is generally of second order .",
    "therefore , close to transition temperature @xmath5 of the double layer , the gap function @xmath14 , which is the order parameter of the phase transition , is small and only terms linear in the gap function contribute .",
    "this linear gap equation , first formulated by gorkov @xcite was rewritten by degennes @xcite as @xmath15    here @xmath14 is the gap function at the position @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the matsubara frequencies , @xmath18 is the effective electron - electron interaction at the position @xmath16 .",
    "the sum is limited to the range @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the debye temperature .",
    "this corresponds to a sum over @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 where @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the debye temperature and frequency and @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath28 is the product of two green functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 which represent a cooperon .",
    "since the green function @xmath31 represents the amplitude of an electron traveling ( at finite temperarture ) from @xmath32 to @xmath16 the product @xmath33 describes the amplitude of a cooperon traveling from @xmath32 to @xmath16 . since the two single - particle green functions are conjugate complex to each other , the product of their amplitudes is proportional to the probability of a single electron to travel from @xmath32 to @xmath16 .",
    "if one interprets in equation @xmath34 @xmath35 as the propagation of single electrons then one has an equivalent problem and its solution is also the solution of the gap equation . in the following the solution of the equivalent problem will be persued .    from the properties of the green functions @xmath36 ( see appendix 6.1 ) it follows that @xmath37 is the electron density if one injects continuously electrons with a rate @xmath38 at the point @xmath39 while their density decays along the path as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance traveled ( not the distance from @xmath32 ) and @xmath42 is the bcs density of states .",
    "the right side of equation @xmath34 @xmath43 ( excluding @xmath44 ) yields the density of electrons at the position @xmath16 when one injects constantly @xmath45 electrons in the incremental volume @xmath46 at the position @xmath32 per time interval @xmath47 which decay during their propagation with the decay rate of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "( @xmath50 represents a ( dimensionless ) number of electrons and the rate of injected electrons per volume is @xmath51 ) .",
    "these electrons propagate with their fermi velocity from @xmath32 to @xmath16 , either directly or diffusively .",
    "their density decays along the path as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the time since the departure from @xmath32 . at the position @xmath16",
    "the surviving density of all arriving electrons is integrated over @xmath54 .",
    "when summed over @xmath55 and multiplied with the attractive electron interaction @xmath18 one has to recover the original @xmath56 .    for further treatment",
    "we define the propagation density @xmath57 .",
    "if an electron with fermi velocity @xmath58 is introduced at the time @xmath59 at the position @xmath32 then @xmath60 describes the probability to find the electron at the time @xmath61 at the position @xmath16 . with this definition we can express @xmath62@xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the sum over @xmath55 in @xmath34 applies only to the exponential decay functions @xmath65 and yields the time function  @xmath66 @xmath67 ( @xmath20=debye frequency ) .",
    "then one can express the gap equation as @xmath68    it is obvious that the superconducting properties of the system occur only in the effective interaction @xmath69 and the decay function @xmath66 .",
    "of course , @xmath14 is the superconducting pair amplitude but in equation @xmath70 it is just the eigen vector of the integral kernel .",
    "the self - consistancy condition requires that this eigen value is equal to one .",
    "this interpretation of the gap equation yields a natural extension to a time dependent pair amplitude or gap function .",
    "one obtains@xmath71 from this equation one can derive a time dependent ginsburg - landau equation @xcite",
    ".    for a homogeneous superconductor one has a constant energy gap .",
    "in this case one can perform the integral over @xmath72 using @xmath73 and dividing by @xmath74@xmath75 which yields@xmath76    the condition ( [ constge ] ) is used to determine the bcs coupling strength @xmath77it has the advantage that it is not restricted to integer values of @xmath78 .",
    "now we can apply the gap equation @xmath70 to the proximity effect .",
    "the direction @xmath79 is chosen perpendicular to the multi - layer and the films are treated as homogeneous in the x - y plane . if there is no magnetic field then the gap depends only on the z direction .",
    "therefore one can perform the integration over @xmath80 .",
    "now the function @xmath81 describes the density at the time @xmath82 and the position @xmath79 integrated over the x and y directions . for the numerical procedure it is more convenient to shift the time integration from the range @xmath83 to the range @xmath84 . @xmath85",

    "the iteration is completed when @xmath336      the important task is to devise a simple fast procedure that describes the ballistic propagation of the electrons for distances shorter than the mean free path @xmath0 and the diffusive propagation for distances larger than @xmath0 .",
    "it helps considerably that only the propagation in z direction has to be modeled properly ( as long as no magnetic field perpendicular to the film is applied ) .",
    "we consider the electrons in a thin layer of thickness @xmath337 in the interval @xmath338 .",
    "half of the electrons have a positive z component @xmath339 of the velocity .",
    "as long as they are not scattered their average velocity in z direction is @xmath340 we take this as the minimum requirement for the ballistic simulation .",
    "the simulation of the diffusion in z direction is rather straight forward . at the time @xmath82",

    "this yields the rule how of one obtains from the occupations at the time @xmath350 the occupation at the next time step @xmath351@xmath352    this yields a one - dimensional diffusion with the diffusion constant @xmath353 .",
    "ballistic propagation requires setting @xmath348 almost equal to 1 . in this case",
    "almost all the @xmath354 electrons move from cell @xmath86 to cell @xmath355 during the time @xmath344 .",
    "this means that they propagate the average distance @xmath356 during the time @xmath344 .",
    "therefore this model does not fulfill the basic requirement for ballistic propagation in three dimension that @xmath357 .",
    "a three - dimensional diffusion can be obtained by a sequential propagation in x , y and z direction , each for a time of @xmath344 with the velocity @xmath58 .",
    "this yields a diffusion constant @xmath358 and triples the average time for the diffusion in z direction .",
    "since the electrons propagate only during every third of the interval @xmath359 in z direction they propagate the distance  @xmath229 during the time @xmath359 , i.e. their average velocity in z direction is only @xmath360 .",
    "we can simulate the average diffusive and ballistic propagation of the electrons in z direction by propagating every other time interval @xmath344 in z direction .",
    "then the time step is @xmath361 . in this case",
    "the diffusion constant is @xmath362 and the ballistic propagation yields @xmath363 as required .",
    "it should be mentioned that it is essential that the electron density is divided into ( at least ) two components , one for motion in the @xmath364 and the other for -z  direction . a single density component with hopping to neighbor places yields only small diffusion constants of @xmath365 and ca nt describe the ballistic propagation at all .    for the normal conductor the same time element @xmath96",
    "is used to simulate the propagation . the thickness @xmath13 is divided in cells ( or layers ) of thickness @xmath366 .",
    "this synchornizes the diffusion in the whole double layer .",

    "the transmission of electrons through an interface between two metals ( which we denote with s and n ) is only in exceptional cases equal to 1 .",
    "if for example the fermi wave number @xmath371 is larger then @xmath372 then any electron in s whose component @xmath373 parallel to the surface is larger than @xmath372 can not cross the interface because afterwards it would have an energy of a least @xmath374 which is larger than the fermi energy @xmath375 in the normal conductor .",
    "an electron in n with fermi energy would not violate the conservation of energy when crossing the interface . however , a plane wave which crosses a step in the potential energy is partially reflected .",
    "therefore the transition probability is less than 1 for any electron .",
    "if one averages the transition probability of all these electrons ( to cross the interface from n to s ) one finds @xmath376 for small @xmath377 the asymptotic expansion is @xmath378 .",
    "the detailed balance requires that in equilibrium the number of electrons which cross from s to n is equal to the number of electron which cross from n to s. let us assume that the electron distribution is in equilibrium and we consider an interface s / n . @xmath379 and @xmath380 are the occupations in the cells on the left and right side of the interface .",
    "the transmission coefficients are by @xmath381 and @xmath382 .",
    "then the occupation at the time @xmath383 is@xmath384 in equilibrium one has @xmath385 and @xmath386 .",
    "this yields @xmath387 since @xmath388 one obtains finally @xmath389    if one considers real metals a considerably more difficult situation arises when the superconductor has a mass enhancement of the density of states ( as most superconductor have , in particular the strong coupling ones ) .",
