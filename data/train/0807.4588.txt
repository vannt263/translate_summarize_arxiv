    "an earthquake is a stick - slip dynamical instability of a pre - existing fault driven by the motion of a tectonic plate [ _ scholz _ , 1998 , 2002 ] .",
    "while an earthquake is a complex phenomenon , certain empirical laws such as the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law and the omori law concerning its statistical properties are known to hold .",
    "one fruitful strategy in understanding such statistical properties of earthquakes might be to properly model an earthquake fault and to elucidate the model properties by numerical computer simulations .",
    "one of popular statistical models of an earthquake fault is the so - called spring - block model originally proposed by burridge and knopoff ( bk ) [ _ burridge and knopoff _ , 1967 ] . in this model ,",
    "an earthquake fault is simulated by an assembly of blocks , each of which is connected via the elastic springs to the neighboring blocks and to the moving plate .",
    "all blocks are subject to the friction force , the source of the nonlinearity in the model , which eventually realizes an earthquake - like frictional instability .",
    "while the spring - block model is obviously a crude model to represent a real earthquake fault , its simplicity enables one to study the statistical properties with high precision .",
    "carlson , langer and others [ _ carlson and langer _ , 1989a ; _ carlson and langer _ , 1989b ; _ carlson et al . _ , 1991 ; _ carlson _ , 1991a ; _ carlson _ , 1991b ; _ shaw et al . _ , 1992 ; _ carlson et al . _ , 1994 ; _ schmittbuhl et al . _ ,",
    "1996 ] studied the statistical properties of the bk model quite extensively both in one dimension ( 1d ) and two dimensions ( 2d ) , paying particular attention to the magnitude distribution of earthquake events . in these studies ,",
    "a simple velocity - weakening friction law was used as a constitutive law .",
    "the spring - block model has also been extended in several ways , _",
    "e.g. _ , taking account of the effect of the viscosity [ _ myers and langer _ , 1993 ; _ shaw _ , 1994 ; _ de and ananthakrisna _ , 2004 ] , modifying the form of the friction force [ _ myers and langer _ , 1993 ; _ shaw _ , 1995 ; _ de and ananthakrisna _ , 2004 ] , considering the long - range interactions between blocks [ _ xia et al .",
    "_ , 2005 , 2008a ; _ mori and kawamura _ , 2008b ] , driving the system only at one end of the system [ _ vieira _ , 1992 ] , or by incorporating the rate- and state - dependent friction law [ _ ohmura and kawamura _ , 2007 ] .    in the previous papers",
    ", the present authors also performed an extensive numerical study of the statistical properties of the 1d and 2d bk models with the velocity - weakening friction law for a wide parameter range , focusing on their _ spatiotemporal correlations _ [ _ mori and kawamura _ , 2005 ; 2006 ; 2008a ; kawamura , 2006 ] .",
    "these studies have revealed several interesting features of the bk model .",
    "for example , the model exhibits either `` near - critical '' ,  supercritical  or `` subcritical '' behaviors primarily depending on its frictional parameter representing the extent of the velocity weakening .",
    "preceding the mainshock , the frequency of smaller events is gradually enhanced , whereas , just before the mainshock , it is suppressed in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming event ( the mogi doughnut ) .",
    "the apparent @xmath2-value of the magnitude distribution changes significantly preceding the mainshock .",
    "although the bk model has widely been used as a useful tool to investigate statistical properties of earthquakes , the block discretization inherent to the model construction is a crude approximation of the originally continuum earthquake fault .",
    "it introduces the short - length cut - off scale into the problem .",
    "therefore , in order to check the validity of the model , it is crucially important to examine the continuum limit of the bk model .",
    "indeed , rice criticized that the discrete bk model with the velocity - weakening friction law was `` intrinsically discrete '' , lacking in a well - defined continuum limit [ _ rice _ , 1993 ] .",
    "rice argued that the spatiotemporal complexity observed in the discrete bk model was due to the inherent discreteness of the model , which should disappear in continuum .",
    "this problem of the continuum limit of the bk model was also discussed by myers and langer [ _ myers and langer _ , 1993 ] , who introduced the kelvin viscosity term to produce a small length scale which allows a well - defined continuum limit .",
    "myers and langer , and subsequently shaw [ _ shaw _ , 1994 ] , observed that the added viscosity term smoothed the rupture dynamics , apparently giving rise to the continuum limit accompanied by the spatiotemporal complexity .",
    "the bk model represents an earthquake fault by an assembly of blocks and springs .",
    "conversely , one can regard the bk model as obtained by discretizing an appropriate wave equation describing the continuum .",
    "in one spatial dimension , an appropriate wave equation might be given by the partial differential equation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the displacement at the spatial position @xmath5 and time @xmath6 , @xmath7 the loading rate by the plate motion , @xmath8 the wave velocity , @xmath9 the characteristic frequency and @xmath10 is the friction force per unit mass .",
    "one may discretize eq.(1 ) as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the grid spacing corresponding to the block size of the bk model . if one regards @xmath13 as the displacement of the @xmath14-th block , eq.(2 ) is the equation of motion of the 1d bk model .",
    "conversely , if one takes the limit @xmath15 starting from the discrete bk model ( 2 ) , one can obtain the continuum limit of the bk model .",
    "as mentioned , the naive continuum limit of the discrete bk model defined by eq.(2 ) has a problem in that the pulse of slip tends to become increasingly narrow in width in the limit @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the dynamics becomes sensitive to the grid spacing @xmath12 .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to introduce the viscosity term @xmath17 into eq.(2 ) to produce a small length scale .",
    "myers and langer showed that , owing to the added viscosity term , the system became independent of the grid spacing @xmath12 as long as a new small length scale @xmath18 , defined by @xmath19 is sufficiently larger than the grid spacing @xmath12 [ _ myers and langer _ , 1993 ] . here , @xmath20 is a viscosity coefficient , and @xmath21 is the velocity - weakening parameter representing the rate of the friction force getting weaker on increasing the sliding velocity ( to be defined below in eq.(7 ) ) .",
    "shaw also showed by adding the viscosity term to the 1d bk model that the magnitude distribution became independent of the grid spacing @xmath12 for sufficiently small @xmath12 [ _ shaw _ , 1994 ] .    in the present paper ,",
    "following shaw , we numerically examine the continuum limit of the 1d bk model by performing extensive numerical simulations on the bk model with successively smaller grid spacings @xmath12 .",
    "namely , with varying the grid spacing @xmath12 , we study how seismic spatiotemporal correlations of the 1d bk model vary and approach the continuum limit .",
    "the two types of the bk model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the one without the viscosity term ( the original bk model ) and the one with the viscosity term ( the modified bk model ) are studied .",
    "our work can be regarded as an extension of the work of shaw concerning the magnitude distribution of the 1d bk model to various types of seismic spatiotemporal correlations of the same model .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we introduce the model and explain some of the details of our numerical simulation . in  3 , we examine the continuum limit of the 1d bk model without the viscosity term .",
    "we analyze the magnitude distribution and various types of seismic spatiotemporal correlation functions , including the recurrence - time distribution , the time - correlation function of seismic events before and after the mainshock , the time development of the spatial correlation function of seismic events before the mainshock , and the time development of the magnitude distribution function before and after the mainshock . in  4 , we make a similar analysis for the 1d bk model with the viscosity term .",
    "finally ,  5 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "let us begin with the 1d wave equation in the continuum with the kelvin viscosity term @xmath17 , @xmath22 in order to make the equation dimensionless , we measure the time @xmath23 in units of the characteristic frequency @xmath9 , the coordinate @xmath5 in units of @xmath24 and the displacement @xmath13 in units of the length @xmath25 , @xmath26 being a static friction per unit mass .",
    "then , the equation of motion can be written in the dimensionless form as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimensionless time , @xmath29 the dimensionless coordinate , @xmath30 the dimensionless displacement , @xmath31 the dimensionless friction force , and @xmath32 is the dimensionless viscosity coefficient .",
    "after the block discretization , one gets @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dimensionless grid spacing , and the notation @xmath35 has been used .",
    "if we put @xmath36 in eq.(6 ) , it reduces to the bk model used in the previous papers with the correspondence @xmath37 [ _ _ m__ori and kawamura , 2005 ; 2006 ] .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath8 has been adsorbed into the definition of the dimensionless variables . in the following , we study the statistical properties of the model ( 6 ) with varying the dimensionless grid spacing @xmath0 in order to see how the spatiotemporal correlation functions behave in the continuum limit @xmath38 .",
    "we investigate both cases of the non - viscosity model with @xmath36 and the viscosity model with @xmath39 .    in order for the model to exhibit a dynamical instability corresponding to an earthquake , it is essential that the friction force @xmath40 possesses a frictional _ weakening _ property , _",
    "i.e. _ , the friction should become weaker as the block slides . here",

    "this observation strongly suggests again that the doughnut - like quiescence might vanish altogether in the continuum limit @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the doughnut - like quiescence observed in the discrete bk model is likely to be a phenomenon closely related to the short - length cut - off scale of the model .",
    "this seems fully consistent with our observation in the previous papers that the one - block events are responsible for the observed doughnut - like quiescence [ _ mori and kawamura _ , 2006 ; 2008a ] .      in figs .",

    "the calculational conditions are the same as in figs . 7 and 8 of the non - viscous case .    in both cases of @xmath48 and 3 , as can be seen from figs .",
    "16 and 17 , the temporal evolution of @xmath68 prior to the mainshock is kept qualitatively similar even when the grid spacing @xmath0 gets smaller .",
    "namely , on approaching the mainshock , weights of larger events are significantly suppressed .",
    "similar behavior was observed in figs . 7 and 8 for the non - viscous case .",
    "we have also studied the `` time - resolved '' local magnitude distributions after the mainshock ( the results not shown here ) . as in the non - viscous case shown in figs . 9 and 10 ,",
    "the magnitude distribution hardly changes on approaching the mainshock even for smaller grid spacing @xmath0 .",
    "overall , the statistical properties of the viscosity bk model in the continuum limit turn out to be qualitatively similar to those of the non - viscosity bk model in the continuum limit , although the `` critical '' aspect , _ e.g. _ , the gr - like behavior , is weakened somewhat .",
    "by contrast , the convergence to the asymptotic continuum limit is much faster in the viscous case than in the non - viscous case .",
    "the manner of this convergence is well controlled by the length scale given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "spatiotemporal correlations of the one - dimensional spring - block ( burridge - knopoff ) model of earthquakes , either with or without the viscosity term , are studied by means of numerical computer simulations .",
    "the continuum limit of the model is examined by systematically investigating the model properties with varying the block - size parameter @xmath0 toward @xmath1 .",
    "the two types of models are analyzed , _",
    "i.e. _ , the 1d bk model with the kelvin viscosity and the one without the kelvin viscosity",
    ". the naive continuum limit of the bk model without the viscosity is known to be problematic in that the dynamics becomes pathological .",
    "the kelvin viscosity term is introduced so that the model dynamics possesses a sensible continuum limit .",
    "the added viscosity term introduces a small - length cut - off scale @xmath103 , which indeed turns out to control the continuum limit of the model .",
    "it also turns out that the viscosity affects the statistical properties of the model somewhat , making large earthquakes smaller and enhancing the deviation from the gr law . in other words ,",
    "the viscosity suppresses the critical feature of the model .",
    "the viscosity tends to make the relative displacement of neighboring blocks being smoother and enhance the correlated motion of blocks .    probably reflecting the intrinsic problem associated with its pathological dynamics , even the _ statistical properties _ of the non - viscosity bk model sometimes continues to change even at our smallest grid spacing studied .",
    "in contrast , those of the viscosity bk model are found to converge well to an asymptotic continuum limit once the grid spacing is taken smaller than the above small - length cut - off scale @xmath93 .",
    "one obvious consequence of the continuum limit @xmath1 limit is that the size of minimum earthquakes gets smaller .",
    "it thus appears that , in the continuum limit of the model , even an infinitesimal earthquake is possible .",
    "by contrast , many of the statistical properties of the original discrete bk model are kept qualitatively the same even in the continuum limit : for example , the model exhibits a seismic acceleration preceding the mainshock .",
    "the magnitude distribution of the model exhibits a significant temporal change before the mainshock , while it exhibits only a negligible change after the mainshock .",
    "this observation in turn gives some guarantee that the original discrete bk model provides a reasonable description of the continuum fault .",
    "one notable difference between the original discrete model and the corresponding model in the continuum limit is the existence / non - existence of the doughnut - like quiescence just before the mainshock .",
    "large events of the original discrete bk model exhibits a seismic acceleration before the mainshock , which is accompanied by a doughnut - like quiescence occurring just before the mainshock in close vicinity of the upcoming mainshock .",
    "it is found that in both viscous and non - viscous cases , as the grid spacing @xmath0 gets smaller , the spatial range of the doughnut - like quiescence becomes narrower , and the doughnut - like quiescence might vanish altogether in the continuum limit .",
    "the doughnut - like quiescence observed in the discrete bk model is then a phenomenon closely related to the short cut - off length scale .",
    "this observation might have some implications to real seismicity .",
    "while the real crust is obviously a continuum , it is not so obvious whether there exists an intrinsic short - length cut - off scale in real seismicity or not . in any case , in real earthquakes , the `` mogi - doughnut '' is occasionally reported to occur [ _ mogi _ , 1969 ; 1979 , _ scholz _ , 2002 ] , although to elucidate its statistical significance is often not easy . our present result might suggest that , if the real crust possesses a cut - off length scale , the `` mogi- doughnut '' quiescence might occur at such a length scale . in other words , spatial inhomogeneity might be an essential ingredient for the `` mogi - doughnut '' to occur .    for the future , it is desirable to extend the present analysis of the continuum limit of the 1d bk model to the corresponding 2d model .",
    "since taking the @xmath1 limit necessarily means taking the large - size limit , performing such analysis in 2d is computationally demanding .",
    "it is also desirable to perform a similar analysis for the bk model based on the rate- and state - dependent friction law [ _ morimoto and kawamura _ , 2007 ] , which is the friction law employed in the study of rice [ _ rice _ , 1993 ] .",
    "this friction law naturally provides a length scale into the problem , even without invoking the kelvin viscosity .",
    "thus , in order to fully resolve the question raised by rice , it would be necessary to perform a similar analysis for the bk model with the rate- and state - dependent friction law .",
    "we leave such interesting extension of the present analysis to a future task .                                                           of earthquake events of the 1d non - viscosity bk model ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "<S> although large events of the original discrete bk model accompany seismic acceleration together with a doughnut - like quiescence just before the mainshock , the spatial range of the doughnut - like quiescence becomes narrower as @xmath0 gets smaller , and in the continuum limit , the doughnut - like quiescence might vanish altogether . </S>",
    "<S> the doughnut - like quiescence observed in the discrete bk model is then a phenomenon closely related to the short - length cut - off scale of the model . </S>"
