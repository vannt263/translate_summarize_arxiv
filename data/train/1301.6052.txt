    "magnetic fields play an important role in determining the evolution of the matter in many astrophysical objects . in highly conducting plasma , the magnetic field",
    "can be amplified by gas contraction or shear motion .",
    "even when the magnetic field is weak initially , the magnetic field can grow rapidly and influence the gas dynamics of the system .",
    "this is particularly important for the high - energy astrophysical phenomena related to strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas associated with objects such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. , urry & pavovani 1995 ) , relativistic jets ( e.g. , mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ; blandford 2002 ) , pulsar winds ( e.g. , gaensler & slane 2006 ; kirk et al . 2009 ) , gamma - ray bursts ( zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ) , and magnetars ( e.g. , woods & thompson 2006 ; mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation is a good description of the global properties and dynamics of such systems well into their nonlinear regimes . in this limit",
    "the electrical resistivity @xmath0 vanishes ( infinite electrical conductivity ) . in this framework",
    ", many multidimensional ideal relativistic mhd ( rmhd ) codes have been developed to investigate relativistic astrophysical phenomena including fully non - linear regimes ( e.g. , komissarov 1999 ; koide et al .",

    "the ideal mhd limit provides a convenient form for solving the equations of rmhd and is also an excellent approximation for many relativistic astrophysical phenomena .",
    "however , in extreme cases such as binary mergers ( the merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star with a black hole ) ( e.g. shibata & taniguchi 2011 ; faber & rasio 2012 ) or the central engine of long grbs ( collapsar ) ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) the electrical conductivity can be small , and regions of high resistivity may appear .    quite often numerical simulations using ideal rmhd exhibit violent magnetic reconnection .",
    "the magnetic reconnection observed in ideal rmhd simulations is due to purely numerical resistivity , occurs as a result of truncation errors , and hence fully depends on details of the numerical scheme and resolution .",
    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most important phenomena in astrophysics .",
    "it is highly dynamic , and it converts magnetic energy into fluid energy . the magnetic reconnection process has been invoked to explain flaring events ( e.g. , lyutikov 2006 ; giannios et al . 2009 ) and magnetic annihilation ( coroniti 1990 ; lyubarsky & kirk 2001 ) in relativistic plasmas . therefore , numerical codes solving the resistive rmhd ( rrmhd ) equations and that allow control of magnetic reconnection according to a physical model of resistivity are highly desirable .    numerical simulation using the ideal rmhd equations",
    "is considerably easier than using the rrmhd equations because the equations become mixed hyperbolic with stiff relaxation terms .",
    "the pioneering work on resistive rmhd done by komissarov ( 2007 ) solved the numerical flux by using the harten - lax - van leer ( hll ) approximate riemann solver and by using strang s splitting technique for the stiff relaxation terms .",
    "more recently , palenzuela et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have proposed a numerical method that solves the stiff relaxation terms in the equations by an implicit - explicit ( imex ) runge - kutta method , and dionysopoulou et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have extended the work of palenzuela et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to 3d .",
    "a different approach has been taken by dumbser & zanotti ( 2009 ) who have applied the high order @xmath1 scheme to solving the resistive rmhd equations , and also takamoto & inoue ( 2011 ) who have used the method of characteristics to solve the maxwell equations accurately .",
    "even more recently , a 3 + 1 resistive general relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) code using mean - field dynamo closure has been developed by bucciantini & del zanna ( 2012 ) .",
    "plasma in the relativistic regime can have three major characteristics : the system has ( 1 ) relativistic fluid velocity ( kinetic energy much greater than rest - mass energy ) , has ( 2 ) relativistic temperature ( internal energy much greater than rest - mass energy ) , or has ( 3 ) relativistic alfvn speed ( magnetic energy much greater than rest - mass energy ) .",
    "the second characteristic of relativistic temperature brings us to the issue of the equation of state ( eos ) of the plasma .",
    "the eos most commonly used in rmhd simulations is designed for plasmas with constant specific heat ratio ( the so - called ideal eos ) . however , this ideal eos is valid only for plasmas with either ultra - relativistic temperature or non - relativistic temperature .",
    "the theory of relativistic perfect gases ( synge 1957 ) has shown that the specific heat ratio can not be constant if consistency with kinetic theory is required .",
    "however , the exact eos involves modified bessel functions and is too complicated to be efficiently implemented in numerical codes . to get around this problem mignone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) introduced an approximate eos given by a simple analytical formulation in the context of relativistic non - magnetized flows .",
    "this approximate eos was applied in the context of relativistic mhd by mignone & mckinney ( 2007 ) . a different eos approximation than that proposed by mignone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) has been proposed by ryu et al .",
    "clearly a determination of the effects of a difference in the choice of the approximate eos is important to further advances in rrmhd .    in this paper , we present the development of a new resistive rmhd simulation code including different realistic eos approximations such as those proposed by mignone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) or by ryu et al .",
    "this new rrmhd code is based on the ideal rmhd code raishin ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 ; 2011 ) which uses a godunov - type scheme to solve the conservation equations of ideal rmhd .",
    "in particular , we apply this new code to the role of the eos in the resistive rmhd regime .",
    "we describe the basic equations of resistive rmhd in  2 , three different equations of state are investigated in  3 , and the numerical methods are described in  4 . the various numerical tests in one - dimension and multi - dimensions are presented in  5 . in  6 we conclude .",

    "this means that high conductivity recovers the ideal - mhd solution . as the conductivity decreases , the maximum gas and magnetic pressure decrease",
    "of course there is no magnetic pressure increase for @xmath151 .",
    "we present calculations of the linear and nonlinear growth of the two - dimensional kelvin - helmhotz instability ( khi ) to investigate the effect of conductivity and the eos on the development of turbulence in the resistive relativistic mhd regime .",

    "saturation in the poloidal field amplitude occurs latter than the transition from the linear to the non - linear khi growth phase .",

    "the difference is likely the result of the reconstruction scheme used here and the different reconstruction scheme used by beckwith & stone . in the nonlinear phase",

    "field amplification is a result of fluid motion in the vortex . in the high conductivity case",
    ", the magnetic field follows the fluid motion , like ideal mhd , and is strongly twisted . when the conductivity declines , the magnetic field is no longer strongly coupled to the fluid motion",

    "the outflow gradually accelerates and nearly saturates by @xmath226 with @xmath227 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the outflow speed in the tm eos case is slightly faster than in the ideal eos case .",
    "the magnetic energy gradually decreases with time",
