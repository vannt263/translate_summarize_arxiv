    "in the recent papers @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite , an original mathematical and numerical framework for modeling biomedical imaging modalities based on mechanical perturbations of the medium is developed .",
    "the objective is to enhance the resolution and stability of tissue property imaging .",
    "many kinds of waves propagate in biological tissues over certain frequency ranges .",
    "each one of them can be used to provide an image of a specific physical parameter .",
    "low - frequency electromagnetic waves are sensitive to electrical conductivity ; optical waves tell about optical absorption , ultrasonic waves reveal tissue s density , mechanical shear waves indicate how tissues respond to shear forces . however , single - wave imaging modalities are known to suffer from low specificity as well as intrinsic instabilities and low resolution ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these fundamental deficiencies are impossible to eliminate , unless additional a priori information is incorporated .",
    "single - wave imaging modalities can only be used for anomaly detection .",
    "expansions techniques for data analysis , which reduce the set of admissible solutions and the number of unknowns , allow robust and accurate reconstruction of the location and of some geometric features of the anomalies , even with moderately noisy data .",
    "one promising way to overcome the inherent limits of single - wave imaging and provide a stable and quantitative reconstruction of a distribution of physical parameters is to combine different wave - imaging modalities ; see again @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a variety of multi - wave imaging approaches are being introduced and studied . in such approaches ,",
    "two or more types of physical waves are involved in order to overcome the individual deficiencies of each one of them and to combine their strengths .",
    "because of the way the waves are combined , multi - wave imaging can produce a single image with the best contrast and resolution properties of the two waves .",
    "three different types of wave interaction can be exploited in multi - wave imaging @xcite : ( i ) the interaction of one kind of wave with tissue can generate a second kind of wave ; ( ii ) a low - frequency wave that carries information about the desired contrast can be locally modulated by a second wave that has better spatial resolution ; ( iii ) a fast propagating wave can be used to acquire a spatio - temporal sequence of the propagation of a slower transient wave .    in @xcite and @xcite , by mechanically perturbing the medium we proved both analytically and numerically the stability and resolution enhancement for reconstructing optical tissue parameters .",
    "we showed how the high contrast of optical tomography @xcite can be coupled to the high resolution of the acoustic propagation in soft tissues .",
    "the use of mechanical perturbations of the medium modeled by acoustics equations in fluids enhance the resolution to the order of the front width of the acoustic wave , which propagates inside the object .",
    "it dramatically increases the low resolution of optical tomography @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation and an extension of the work started in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we keep here the same models for the diffusive light propagation @xcite and for the acoustic perturbations .",
    "our aim is to extend the reconstruction algorithm developed in @xcite to a large class of non smooth functions taken in a subclass of @xmath0 , the set of functions with bounded variation .    the reconstruction and the stability of the inversion are shown in this general case .",
    "such an extension is essential for applying the proposed hybrid method to biological tissues .",
    "indeed , the physiologic parameters that we want to recover can not be considered smooth or piecewise smooth as assumed in @xcite .    under this natural assumption ,",
    "new mathematical difficulties rise to prove that the acousto - optic data contain enough information for reconstructing the absorption map .",
    "the lack of smoothness also causes difficulties to ensure the stability of the algorithm .",
    "this paper resolves these challenging issues .",
    "it provides both an original reconstruction formula and a new stability result in the general setting .",
    "as far as we know , together with the recent work @xcite , it is the first work in imaging discontinuous parameter distributions from internal measurements .    throughout this paper , we denote by @xmath1 the space of schwartz and by @xmath2 its dual .",

    "the extrapolation length @xmath13 , and the bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 are known positive constants .",
    "the incoming illumination @xmath16 is a non negative non zero map and is also supposed to be known .",
    "moreover , the support @xmath17 of @xmath18 is assumed to be smooth .",
    "the acoustic perturbations are assumed to be generated by spherical pressure waves .",
    "let @xmath19 be the front width of the acoustic wave and let @xmath20 be the wave shape .",
    "the acoustic perturbations take the form :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24\\eta,+{\\infty}[$ ] ; see @xcite .",

    "the last assumption ensures that the map @xmath30 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "the effect of the displacement @xmath31 on the absorption map is assumed to be only a shifting effect , that is , to say that @xmath32 becomes @xmath33 implicitly defined on @xmath34 by    @xmath35    or equivalently , by the formula @xmath36 .",
    "we introduce the displaced light fluence as the unique solution of    @xmath37    by extending @xmath33 by @xmath15 if necessary .",
    "computing now the cross - correlation on the boundary @xmath38 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 it follows that    @xmath41    assume that the term in the left - hand side of the above identity can be measured .",
    "we define the measurement as the real quantity given by @xmath42 throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath43 is known for any displacement field @xmath31 given by ( [ eq_defv ] ) .    for a smooth surface @xmath44 and @xmath23 , we assume that we are in possession of    @xmath45\\eta,+{\\infty } [ .",

    "the aim is to prove that the reconstruction algorithm from acousto - optic differential measurements presented in @xcite can be extended for a very general class of discontinuous absorption maps . for doing so , we start from the same differential boundary measurements ( [ imagdata ] ) and consider the case where @xmath32 has bounded variations . under some additional hypothesis ,",
    "we correctly interpret the first order term in the asymptotic formula when @xmath47 goes to zero .",
    "then , by giving a weak definition of the spherical means radon transform @xmath48 , we show how the internal data @xmath49 , satisfying @xmath50 can be reconstructed stably in @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath17 being a smooth domain .",

    "the second part is to show that a stable reconstruction of the absorption map @xmath32 is possible from this internal data @xmath49 . in order to do so",
    ", we establish a system of two coupled elliptic equations for @xmath57 and solve this coupled system by the classical fixed point theorem .",
    "we also show that the solution depends continuously on @xmath49 and therefore can verify the global stability of the reconstruction",
    ".    finally , we present numerical illustrations to substantiate the potential of the proposed method .",
    "we consider the imaging of a highly discontinuous absorption map , chosen from a real biological tissue data .",
    "in order to work with a wide set of discontinuous functions , we introduce @xmath58 and several important subspaces of @xmath58 .      a function @xmath59 is said to have bounded variation if its weak derivative @xmath60 is a finite radon measure . for any @xmath61",
