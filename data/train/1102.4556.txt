    "in this paper , we study traveling waves for monotone ( i.e. , order - preserving ) semiflows @xmath0 with the bistability structure on some subsets of the space @xmath1 consisting of all continuous functions from the habitat @xmath2(@xmath3 or @xmath4 ) to the banach lattice @xmath5 , where @xmath6 or @xmath7 is the set of evolution times . here",
    "the bistability structure is generalized from a number of studies for various evolution equations .",
    "it means that the restricted semiflow on @xmath5 admits two ordered stable equilibria , between which all others are unstable .",
    "we focus on the existence of traveling waves connecting these two stable equilibria , which are called bistable traveling waves .",
    "this setting allows us to study not only autonomous and time - periodic evolution systems in a homogeneous habitat ( media ) , but also those in a periodic habitat . besides",
    ", the obtained results can be extended to the semiflows with weak compactness on some subsets of the space @xmath8 consisting of all monotone functions from @xmath9 to @xmath5 .    to explain the concept of the bistability structure , we recall some related works on typical evolution equations .",
    "fife and mcleod @xcite proved the existence and global asymptotic stability of monotone traveling waves for the following reaction - diffusion equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "clearly , the restriction of system on @xmath12 is the ordinary differential equation @xmath13 , which admits a unique unstable equilibrium between two ordered and stable ones .",
    "the same property is shared by the nonlocal dispersal equation in @xcite and the lattice equations in @xcite .",
    "chen @xcite studied a general nonlocal evolution equation @xmath14 , which also possess the above bistability structure . some related investigations on discrete - time equations can be found in @xcite . for the time - periodic reaction - diffusion equation @xmath15 , the spatially homogeneous equation is a time - periodic ordinary differential equation . in this case , the equilibrium in the bistability structure should be understood as the time - periodic solution . under such bistability assumption ,",
    "alikakos , bates and chen @xcite obtained the existence of bistable time - periodic traveling waves . recently , yagisita @xcite studied bistable traveling waves for discrete and continuous - time semiflows on the space consisting of all left - continuous and non - decreasing functions from @xmath9 to @xmath12 under the assumption that there is exactly one intermediate unstable equilibrium . it should be mentioned that the result in @xcite for continuous - time semiflows requires an additional assumption on the existence of a pair of upper and lower solutions .",
    "note that the restrictions on @xmath12 of the afore - mentioned systems are all scalar equations , and hence , there is only one unstable equilibrium in between two stable ones .",
    "but in the case where @xmath16 , there may be multiple unstable equilibria .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why some ideas and techniques developed for scalar equations can not be easily extended to higher dimensional systems .",
    "volpert @xcite established the existence and stability of traveling waves for the bistable reaction - diffusion system @xmath17 by using topological methods , where @xmath18 is a positive definite diagonal matrix .",
    "fang and zhao @xcite further extended these results to the case where @xmath18 is semi - positive definite via the vanishing viscosity approach .",
    "consider the following parabolic equation in a cylindrical domain @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is of the same type as the nonlinearity in and @xmath22 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary in @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , the restriction of the solution semiflow of on @xmath24 gives rise to the following @xmath25-independent system : @xmath26 one can see from matano @xcite ( or casten and holland @xcite ) that any nonconstant steady state of is linearly unstable when the domain @xmath22 is convex .",
    "it follows that if @xmath22 is convex , then admits the bistability structure : its @xmath25-independent system has two ( constant ) linearly stable steady states , between which all others are linearly unstable .",
    "in such a case , berestycki and nirenberg @xcite obtained the existence and uniqueness of bistable traveling waves . in the case where @xmath22 is an appropriate dumbbell - shaped domain ,",
    "matano @xcite constructed a counterexample to show that has stable non - constant steady states , and berestycki and hamel @xcite also proved the nonexistence of traveling waves connecting two stable constant steady states . for bistable traveling waves in time - delayed reaction - diffusion equations ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "for such an equation with time delay @xmath27 , one can choose @xmath28,{\\mathbb { r}})$ ] so that its solution semiflow has the bistability structure .",
    "recently , there is an increasing interest in reaction diffusion equations in periodic habitats .",
    "a typical example is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a positive periodic function with period @xmath31 .",
    "define @xmath32,{\\mathbb { r}})$ ] and @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath34 and that any element in @xmath35 is a constant function in @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the solution semiflow of on @xmath37 can be regarded as a conjugate semiflow on @xmath36 , and hence , the bistability structure should be understood as : the restriction of the solution semiflow of on @xmath35 has two ordered @xmath38-periodic steady states , between which all others are unstable .",
    "assuming that the function @xmath21 is of bistable type , xin @xcite obtained the existence of spatially periodic ( pulsating ) traveling wave as long as @xmath39 is sufficiently close to a positive constant in a certain sense ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , whether the solution semiflow of admits the bistability structure remains an open problem .",
    "we will give an affirmative answer in section 6.3 and further improve xin s existence result .",
    "meanwhile , a counterexample will be constructed to show that the solution semiflow of has no bistability structure in the general case of varying @xmath40 .",
    "more recently , chen , guo and wu @xcite proved the existence , uniqueness and stability of spatially periodic traveling waves for one - dimensional lattice equations in a periodic habitat under the bistability assumption .",
    "there are also other types of bistable waves ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . for monostable systems in periodic habitats , we refer to @xcite and references therein .    in general",
    ", there are multiple intermediate unstable equilibria in between two stable ones in the case where the space @xmath5 is high dimensional .",
    "meanwhile , it is possible for the given system to have intermediate unstable time - periodic orbits in @xmath5 .",
    "these give more difficulties to the study of bistable semiflows than monostable ones , whose restricted systems on @xmath5 have only one unstable and one stable equilibria . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we will show that all these unstable equilibria and all points in these periodic orbits are unordered in @xmath5 under some appropriate assumptions . with this in mind ,",
    "a bistable system can be regarded as the union of two monostable systems although such a union is not unique . from this point of view",
    ", we establish a link between monostable subsystems and the bistable system itself , which plays a vital role in the propagation of bistable traveling waves .",
    "this link is stated in terms of spreading speeds of monostable subsystems ( see assumption ( a6 ) ) . for spreading speeds of various monostable evolution systems",
    ", we refer to @xcite and references therein .    in our investigation , we consider seven cases : ( i ) @xmath6 and @xmath41 ; ( ii ) @xmath6 and @xmath42 ; ( iii ) @xmath43 and @xmath41 ; ( iv ) @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; ( v ) periodic habitat ; ( vi ) weak compactness ; ( vii ) time periodic .",
    "for the case ( i ) , we combine the above observations for general bistable semiflows and yagisita s perturbation idea in @xcite to prove the existence of traveling waves . for the case ( iii )",
    ", we use the bistable traveling waves @xmath45 of discrete - time semiflows @xmath46 to approximate the bistable wave of the continuous - time semiflow @xmath47 .",
    "this new approach heavily relies on an estimation of the boundedness of @xmath48 as @xmath49 , which is proved by the bistability structure of the semiflow ( see inequalities and ( [ bistabilityinequ2 ] ) ) .",
    "it turns out that our result does not require the additional assumption on the existence of a pair of upper and lower solutions as in @xcite . in the case",
    "( ii ) , both the evolution time @xmath50 and the habitat @xmath2 are discrete , a traveling wave @xmath51 of @xmath52 can not be well - defined in the usual way because the wave speed @xmath53 and hence , the domain of @xmath54 is unknown .",
    "so we define it to be a traveling wave of an associated map @xmath55 .",
    "however , @xmath55 has much weaker compactness than @xmath56 . to overcome this difficulty , we establish a variant of helly s theorem for monotone functions from @xmath9 to @xmath5 in the appendix , which is also of its own interest .",
    "this discovery also enables us to study monotone semiflows in a periodic habitat and with weak compactness , respectively .",
    "further , we can deal with the case ( iv ) by the similar idea as in the case ( iii ) because now traveling waves in the case ( ii ) are defined on @xmath9 . traveling waves for a time - periodic system",
    "can be obtained with the help of the discrete - time semiflow generated by the associated poincar map .",
    "motivated by the discussions in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) , we can regard a semiflow in a periodic habitat as a conjugate semiflow in a homogeneous discrete habitat , and hence , we can employ the arguments for the cases ( ii ) and ( iv ) to establish the existence of spatially periodic bistable traveling waves .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our main assumptions .",
    "section 3 is focused on discrete - time , continuous - time , and time - periodic compact semiflows on some subsets of @xmath57 . in section 4 ,",
    "we extend our results to compact semiflows in a periodic habitat . in section 5",
    ", we further investigate semiflows with weak compactness . in section 6",
    ", we apply the abstract results to four classes of evolution systems : a time - periodic reaction - diffusion system , a parabolic system in a cylinder , a parabolic equation with periodic diffusion , and a time - delayed reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "a short appendix section completes the paper .",
    "throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath5 is an ordered banach space with the norm @xmath58 and the cone @xmath59 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath5 is also a vector lattice with the following monotonicity condition : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
