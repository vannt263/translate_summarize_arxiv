    "* and references therein ) .",
    "also planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the bulge have been studied spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "a group of bulge stars that has so far not been studied in detail by high - resolution spectroscopy consist of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "agb stars represent the last stage of stellar evolution where the energy output is dominated by nuclear burning .",
    "this stage is characterised by strong pulsations of the envelope that enhance the stellar wind , which is accelerated by radiation pressure acting on dust particles formed in the outflowing material . eventually , the stellar evolution is terminated by the high mass loss and the star may enter the pn phase . in the deep interior of the star ,",
    "nucleosynthetic processes take place that produce carbon ( @xmath0c ) and heavy elements .",
    "these may subsequently be brought to the surface by a deep mixing event called the third dredge - up ( 3dup ) .",
    "if enough c is added to the atmosphere , the abundance ratio of c to o ( by number of atoms ) will exceed 1.0 and the star will become a carbon star ( c - star ) . the formation of c - stars depends on the initial mass and metallicity : a star may turn into a c - star only if it is massive enough to undergo enough 3dup events , where the lower mass limit is a function of metallicity , being lower for lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "the lack of c - stars in the inner regions of m31 @xcite suggests that there could be a metallicity threshold above which the formation of c - stars is inhibited altogether .",
    "agb stars in the galactic bulge are interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , it has been shown that intrinsic carbon stars , i.e.  stars that owe their enhancement of c to internal nucleosynthesis and 3dup and not to binary mass transfer , are widely absent in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "this would mean that either the mass of bulge stars is too low or the metallicity too high to undergo ( sufficient ) 3dup to form c - stars .",
    "however , it is known that oxygen - rich agb stars in the outer galactic bulge show absorption lines of technetium ( tc ) , a clear indicator of recent or ongoing 3dup @xcite .",
    "this suggests that 3dup does happen in bulge stars , but probably not enough to form c - stars .",
    "an exception may be the first carbon mira in the direction of the galactic bulge that was recently presented by @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if that star is indeed a member of the galactic bulge ) stars .",
    "these were suspected by cole & weinberg to be infrared carbon stars .",
    "however , these objects lack spectroscopic confirmation of their c - star nature . ] .",
    "samples of non - variable m - type giants , the precursors of variable agb stars , have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one of their main results is that the mean metallicity of m - giants in the bulge is slightly sub - solar , and that stars with super - solar metallicity are not common . on the other hand ,",
    "it was concluded by @xcite that pne in the galactic bulge , the evolutionary successors of agb stars , have a relatively high , i.e.on average super - solar , metallicity . yet",
    "again , @xcite suggests that agb stars in the outer bulge predominantly descend from the _ metal - poor _ population ( @xmath4\\approx-0.6 $ ] ) , not from the metal - rich population ( @xmath4\\approx+0.3 $ ] ) of the bulge .",
    "this latter result was derived from the fact that the radial velocity dispersion of agb stars and also of pne in the outer bulge is similar to that of the metal - poor population , which differs significantly from that of the metal - rich population .",
    "finally , @xcite and @xcite showed that many galactic bulge pne exhibit evidence of mixed chemistry with emission from both silicate dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , the latter being a signature of c - rich chemistry .",
    "such signatures are difficult to explain in an environment with ( assumed ) low c / o ratio , which required @xcite to invoke hydrocarbon chemistry in an uv - irradiated , dense torus around the central stars of the pne . in their chemical model",
    ", the formation of pahs would be considerably eased if the c / o ratio was increased from its initial value by at least a few 3dup events .",
    "these considerations make galactic bulge agb stars interesting targets for further investigation .",
    "a determination of the metallicity and mass of agb stars would help in understanding the lack of intrinsic c - stars in the bulge .",
    "in particular , a metallicity determination would shed light on the discrepancies in the metallicities of non - variable m - type giants and pne in the bulge .",
    "a measurement of the c / o ratio in bulge agb stars would provide observational constraints to explanations for the mixed - chemistry phenomenon in galactic bulge pne .    in this paper we present near - ir",
    "spectroscopic observations of such a sample of stars and the chemical composition derived from them .",
    "the near - ir range has a number of advantages over the optical spectral range for studies of bulge red giants , most of all the lower interstellar extinction , less crowding of lines , and smaller effects of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "also 3d effects are smaller in the near - ir than in the optical range @xcite .",
    "thus , with these data , abundance determinations are done that would not be possible to obtain from optical spectra , as used e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the sample selection , observations , and data reduction are presented in sect .",
    "[ sel_obs_red ] , the analysis of that data is described in sect .",
    "[ analysis ] ; the results and their discussion are to be found in sect .  [ res_disc ] ; and conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "[ conclusio ] .",
    "in order to study the dust formation in the circumstellar environment of agb stars , a mid - infrared spectroscopic survey with the irs spectrograph @xcite on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope was performed on a sample of galactic bulge agb stars ( spitzer proposal i d # 3167 , pi j.  blommaert ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the targets for that survey were selected from the isogal survey @xcite in intermediate bulge fields ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 , corresponding distance from the mid - plane @xmath7pc at @xmath8kpc ) .",
    "the @xmath9)$ ] colour , where [ 15 ] is the 15@xmath10 m band of the iso satellite , is an estimate of the dust mass - loss rate of the stars @xcite and was used to ensure that the full range of mass - loss rates , starting from the onset of ( dust ) mass loss up to the mass - loss rates of the so - called super - winds of oh / ir stars ( @xmath11 ) was included in the sample .",
    "we selected from this _ spitzer _ irs sample those stars for high - resolution near - ir observations for which we expected to be able to model their near - ir spectra , i.e.  oh / ir stars were excluded . nevertheless , four large - amplitude variables ( lavs ) were observed .",
    "following the recommendations of @xcite , these four lavs were selected such that they would be near minimum light at the time of the observing run .",
    "the initial goal of the observations was to determine the c / o and @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios of the stars as an `` evolutionary clock '' along the agb as a result of repeated 3dup .",
    "the observations were carried out in visitor mode ( observer : j.  blommaert ) with the cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ( crires * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in three nights between 09 and 12 june 2008 .",
    "the target stars themselves were used as guide star for the wave - front sensor of the adaptive optics system . an entrance slit width of 0.4was chosen , which results in a nominal resolving power of @xmath12 .    along with the 37 bulge agb stars from the spitzer sample",
    ", spectra were also obtained of a few comparison stars that had been studied previously with high - resolution near - ir spectroscopy by other authors .",
    "these include bmb  78 studied by @xcite , bd@xmath13012971 , which was studied by @xcite , as well as bmb  289 , which was investigated by both these works .",
    "furthermore , spectra of five k / m - type field giants were obtained ; the analysis and results for the field stars are reported in the appendix .",
    "also included in the present paper is an analysis of crires spectra of eight agb stars in the outer bulge , the so - called plaut stars @xcite .",
    "they are much further from the galactic mid - plane than the spitzer stars , at @xmath14 or @xmath15kpc .",
    "these stars were selected from the sample discussed in @xcite and include all four stars that were found to contain tc in their atmosphere , as well as four tc - poor stars .",
    "these observations were done either in the science verification runs ( august 2006 ) or in a regular service mode observing programme ( prog .",
    "i d 383.d-0685(a ) , september 2009 ) .",
    "all stars were observed at least in one setting in the h - band ( grating order 36 ) and in the k - band ( grating order 24 ) .",
    "the h - band spectra cover approximately the range @xmath16 to 1561 nm , with a gap of @xmath17 nm between the detectors . due to contamination from neighbouring orders , only data from detector chips 2 and 3",
    "are considered here .",
    "the h - band spectra are dominated by the @xmath0co band head , a number of oh and cn lines , as well as atomic lines ( fe , ni , si , ti , s ) .",
    "the k - band spectra in grating order 24 cover the range @xmath18 to 2407 nm and are dominated by co @xmath19 lines .",
    "sixteen of the science targets and one of the comparison stars were observed in two additional settings in the k - band to also have lines available of atomic species that are relevant for the dust formation .",
    "these spectra in the grating orders 27 and 26 cover the range @xmath20 to 2134 nm and 2174  2222 nm , respectively . besides being cluttered with abundant cn lines ,",
    "these spectra contain , amongst others , lines of na , mg , al , si , sc , ti , and fe .",
    "the na lines were targeted to check a possible correlation between na line equivalent width measured from low - resolution spectra and dust mineralogy in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this correlation was not reproduced with the high - resolution spectra .",
    "a basic reduction of the data was done with the standard eso crires pipeline , version 1.7.0 .",
    "further processing , in particular wavelength calibration and telluric correction , was done with custom - made idl tools .",
    "the h - band spectra were wavelength - calibrated manually using the thar lamp exposures taken at day time . due to the lack of suitable thar lines in the k - band settings , these spectra were wavelength - calibrated using the numerous telluric features imprinted in them . before dividing the science target spectrum by the telluric standard star spectrum for telluric correction ,",
    "both spectra were re - binned to a common wavelength vector and the airmass of the telluric spectrum was adjusted to that of the corresponding science spectrum according to the lambert - beer law : @xmath21,\\ ] ] with @xmath22 the flux of the telluric standard star spectrum continuum - normalised to 1.0 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 the airmass of the science target and of the telluric standard star , respectively .",
    "the science spectrum was then divided by the adjusted standard star spectrum .",
    "this careful procedure in the telluric correction yielded very satisfactory results .",
    "weak residuals from the division were only discernible in the cores of the strongest telluric lines .",
    "no telluric correction was applied to the h - band spectra because the wavelength range under consideration is essentially free from telluric absorption .",
    "the achieved signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel of the reduced one - dimensional spectra is relatively high ( @xmath25 ) for most stars , only for a few stars it is somewhat low ( of the order of 30 ) .",
    "the s / n is thus not the limiting factor in the analysis of most stars .",
    "particular care was taken in the final step of data reduction , the continuum normalisation .",
    "the prime method used in this step was to identify narrow pieces of spectrum ( a few 0.01 up to 0.10 nm ) that are basically unaffected by line absorption in as many of the sample stars as possible .",
    "the mean flux of the 30% brightest pixels in these ranges was set to define the continuum ( flux=1.0 ) .",
    "this continuum placement was always checked in comparison with synthetic spectra .",
    "figure  [ example_fit ] provides an example of how well the continuum in observed and synthetic spectra are matched . in some cases ,",
    "in particular for the coolest and most strongly variable stars , even these narrow pieces of spectrum were affected by line absorption . in these cases ,",
    "the continuum was placed manually , mostly by dividing it by its maximum flux , except in cases that were obviously affected by bad pixels , residuals of the telluric correction , or emission components .",
    "this method was necessary anyway in the k - band spectra of grating order 24 because this spectral region is heavily cluttered with co @xmath19 lines .",
    "before determining elemental abundances from the high - resolution spectra using spectral synthesis techniques , the main physical parameters of our sample stars need to be determined .",
    "we derived those stellar parameters from low - resolution optical spectra , broad band photometry , and the pulsation periods of the stars .",
    "these data will be described in more detail in a separate paper ( vanhollebeke et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the pulsation periods of the sample stars are an important ingredient for the stellar parameter determination .",
    "k - band photometry of the spitzer sub - sample spanning @xmath26 days was obtained by one of us ( pw ) and analysed by @xcite , who also derived pulsation periods where possible .",
    "furthermore , the vizier database was searched for additional period determinations . the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle)-ii catalogue provided pulsation periods for a few more objects , in particular among the short - period , low - amplitude variables . in cases where two periods were available , the one from @xcite was adopted . for the plaut stars ,",
    "the periods and k - band magnitudes were taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mean k - band magnitudes and adopted periods are listed in columns  4 and 5 , respectively , of table  [ tab_params ] ."
