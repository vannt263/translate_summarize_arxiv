    "the discussion @xcite of the physics that underlies room - temperature ferromagnetism in transition - metal doped semiconductors has largely focussed on _ substitutional _ geometries , e.g. mn@xmath0 site in gaas . indeed , there is a well - established tradition that 3@xmath3 impurities in iii - v semiconductors are largely substitutional @xcite , while in si they are mostly interstitials @xcite .",
    "modern first - principles total - energy calculations afford testing of this classic paradigm .",
    "recent experiments @xcite find that mn atoms occupy both substitutional as well as interstitial positions in gaas .",
    "there have been suggestions from recent theoretical work @xcite suggested that primarily surface energetics will funnel mn atoms in to interstitial sites from surface adatom positions . while mn@xmath0 behaves as a hole - producing acceptor , at the interstitial site , mn@xmath1 behaves as an electron - producing donor .",
    "since ferromagnetism is mediated by free - carriers , mn@xmath1 could modify the magnetic properties from the case where only substitutional mn sites were occupied .    using density - functional theory",
    "as implemented within plane - wave pseudopotential total energy method , we consider here bulk and epitaxial growth conditions , investigating isolated defects ( mn@xmath0 and mn@xmath1 ) and their complexes .",
    "we find that the mn impurity in gaas is stable in both substitutional and interstitial geometries depending on ( a ) the fermi energy ( which can be changed via external doping ) , ( b ) chemical potentials during growth and ( c ) bulk versus epitaxial growth conditions .",
    "the origin of these dependences is as follows : ( a ) as the formation energy of impurities that are neutral with respect to the lattice site they occupy ( _ e.g. _ mn@xmath4 ) does not depend on the fermi energy ( @xmath5 ) , the formation energy of positively charged impurities ( _ e.g. _ mn@xmath6 ) decreases as @xmath5 is shifted towards the vbm .",
    "hence , the difference in the formation energies between mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath7 decreases with @xmath2-type doping , resulting in increased solubility of interstitial mn .",
    "( b ) substitution of ga by mn involves the removal of a ga atom and the introduction of a mn atom at the site vacated by ga .",
    "thus , substitution is generally enhanced under ga - poor , mn - rich growth conditions . on the other hand the formation energy of mn at an interstitial site",
    "does not depend on the ga chemical potential .",
    "thus , one may stabilize substitutional ( interstitial ) doping using ga - poor ( ga - rich ) growth conditions .",
    "( c ) solid solubility can be controlled thermodynamically using epitaxial instead of bulk growth conditions @xcite .",
    "the absence of a substrate under bulk growth conditions allows the growing solid as well as its possible disproportionation products to attain their free - standing lattice geometry .",
    "this is the case when the growth takes place from the melt as in bridgman growth .",
    "then , if phase separation occurs , the precipitate will take up its most stable crystal structure , _",
    "i.e. _ mnas in the nias structure .",
    "in contrast , under thin - film epitaxial growth conditions ( as in mbe , mocvd ) competing phases such as phase separated mnas are forced to be coherent with the gaas substrate . as zincblende mnas strained on gaas is less stable than the nias phase of mnas , phase separation is more costly under coherent epitaxial conditions , and one expects @xcite less phase separation , hence enhanced solubility .",
    "we find the following :    \\(i ) substitutional mn has two stable charge states : neutral ( mn@xmath7 ) and negatively charged ( mn@xmath8 ) charge state which have 1 and 0 holes , respectively . the calculated acceptor transition e(0/- ) between these states occurs at e@xmath9 + 0.13 ev , in good agreement with the experimental value of e@xmath9 + 0.11 ev @xcite . here",
    "e@xmath9 corresponds to the valence band maximum of the host material .",
    "\\(ii ) the interstitial sites that mn can occupy have either tetrahedral ( coordinated to four as or four ga atoms ) or hexagonal symmetry .",
    "we find that mn at the tetrahedral interstitial site coordinated by as is more stable than that coordinated by ga , and exhibits a single charge state mn@xmath10 for all values of the fermi energy .",
    "the ( 0/+ ) and ( + /2 + ) donor transitions are found to lie inside the conduction band , so , isolated mn@xmath1 produce electrons that will compensate the holes created by mn@xmath0 .",
    "\\(iii ) under _ bulk _ growth conditions , the formation energy per mn of substitutional mn is @xmath11h(mn@xmath4)=0.91+@xmath12-@xmath13 ev=0.17  -@xmath14-@xmath13 ev , whereas interstitial mn has @xmath11h ( mn@xmath15)=0.55-@xmath13 + 2@xmath5 ev per mn . here",
    "@xmath5 is the fermi energy measured with respect to the valence band maximum of the host material , and @xmath14 and @xmath13 are the chemical potentials of as and mn respectively .",
    "if we use maximally as - rich growth conditions ( @xmath14=0 ev ) and @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) , then we find @xmath11h(mn@xmath7)=0.91 ev . as one dopes the sample @xmath2-type and @xmath5 approaches the vbm ( @xmath5=0 ) , the energy difference between the formation energies of mn@xmath7 and mn@xmath6 reduces to 0.38 ev .",
    "it could decrease even further if @xmath5 penetrates the valence band with doping , or if the growth conditions are made less as - rich .",
    "the interstitial concentration is then expected to further increase .",
    "this is confirmed by recent experiments @xcite which use ga - rich conditions for growth .",
    "\\(iv ) under _ epitaxial _ growth conditions , the formation energies of both substitutional and interstitial mn decrease by 0.74  ev / mn , so their concentrations increase concomitantly leading to the possibilities of clusters .",
    "there is strong coulomb interactions between the oppositely charged constituents involving two substitutional ( mn@xmath0 ) and one interstitial ( mn@xmath1 ) ; the cluster mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0 is thus strongly stabilized and found to be more stable under @xmath2-type conditions than clusters involving three mn@xmath0 .",
    "epitaxial growth conditions increases the solubility of such mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0 clusters , with formation energy of -0.15 + @xmath5 ev per cluster for the q=+1 charge state under as - rich conditions and @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) .",
    "\\(v ) the presence of interstitial mn in the mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0 cluster provides a channel for the spins on the two substitutional mn to align ferromagnetically even when there are no free carriers present in the cluster .",
    "we therefore conclude that ferromagnetism in gaas : mn can arise both from holes induced by isolated substitutional mn atoms discussed previously ( dietl ) as well as from charge compensated substitutional - interstitial clusters .",
    "the formation energy for a defect comprising of atoms @xmath16 in the charge state @xmath17 was computed using the density functional supercell method using the expression @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total energies of a supercell with and without the defect @xmath16 respectively .",
    "@xmath21 denotes the number of atoms of defect @xmath16 transferred in or out of the reservoir ( equal to 1 for an atom removed and -1 for an atom added ) , while @xmath22 denotes their chemical potentials .",
    "_ total energies : _ the total energies of the charged supercells were computed by compensating any additional charge on the impurity atom by a uniform jellium background and have been corrected for interactions between charges in neighboring cells using the makov and payne correction @xcite . for isolated defects we used both the monopole as well as quadrupole corrections , while for composite defects we have added only the monopole correction to the total energy assuming all the charge to be localized at a single point .",
    "we use the static dielectric constant of gaas ( 12.4 ) @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole moment of the isolated defects was calculated as the difference between the moments of the supercell with the charged defect and that with the neutral defect .",
    "_ transition energies : _ the defect transition energy @xmath23 is the value of the fermi energy @xmath5 at which @xmath24=@xmath25 .",
    "the zero of the fermi energy is chosen as the valence band maximum @xmath26 of the pure host at the @xmath27 point .",
    "_ chemical potential limits : _ as the reservoir supplying the atoms could be elemental solids , or compounds formed from the elements , we express @xmath22 as the sum of the energy of the element in its most stable structure @xmath28 , and an additional energy @xmath29 _ i.e _",
    "@xmath30 = @xmath28 + @xmath29 .",
    "the required ranges of @xmath29 are determined by @xmath12 @xmath31 0 ; @xmath13 @xmath31 0 ; @xmath14 @xmath31 0 ( no precipitation of solid elements ) and by the formation energies of gaas , and mnas .",
    "the allowed values of chemical potential are such that gaas is stable , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath32 , the latter being the formation energy of zinc - blende gaas .",
    "further , as mn should not precipitate as mnas , we restrict @xmath33 , the formation energy of mnas in its most stable ( nias ) structure . for epitaxial growth conditions , the formation energy of zinc - blende mnas lattice - matched to gaas is considered . in this case",
    "we calculate the epitaxial formation energy , @xmath34 , forcing the in - plane lattice constant of mnas to equal that of gaas , while the out - of - plane lattice constant , c , is allowed to vary . for coherent epitaxial growth",
    "the condition that mnas should not form during incorporation of mn in gaas becomes @xmath35 .",
    "the energies e(@xmath16 ) , e(0 ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath34 and @xmath29 are calculated within the density functional formalism , through the momentum - space pseudopotential total energy representation @xcite , using ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "the gga - pw91 version of the exchange - correlation functional @xcite and no correction for the band gap underestimation was made .",
    "the calculations were performed over a monkhorst - pack 4x4x4 k - point grid for 64 @xcite and 216 atom supercells of gaas using vasp @xcite .",
    "changing the k - point mesh from 2x2x2 to 4x4x4 changed the formation energies by @xmath38 20  mev .",
    "larger 256 atom supercells with 1x1x2 k - points were used for the calculations with clusters to ensure a larger separation between clusters .",
    "we used a plane wave cutoff of 227.2 ev for these calculations . increasing the cutoff to 300 ev , changed the formation energies by @xmath38 10 mev .",
    "as the lattice constant of the supercell was kept fixed at the gga optimised value for gaas of @xmath39=5.738 @xmath40 @xcite , the internal coordinates were optimised .",
    "our calculated ( experimental ) formation energies are @xmath41  =  -0.74 ( -0.74 ) , @xmath42  =  -0.74 ( -0.61 ) ev and @xmath43  @xmath38 0 ev . for elemental mn",
    "we assume the nonmagnetic fcc structure @xcite , while for elemental ga , we assume the base - centered orthorhombic structure .",
    "the charge corrected @xcite mn@xmath0 ( 0/- ) transition as well as the difference in formation energies between mn@xmath7 and mn@xmath6 are given in table i for supercell sizes of 64 and 216 atoms .",
    "we see that changing the supercell size from 64 to 216 atoms lowers the acceptor energy by 30 - 50 mev and stabilizes mn@xmath7 over mn@xmath6 by 50 - 150 mev .",
    "the charge correction increases the acceptor energy by 60 - 90 mev and stabilizes mn@xmath7 over mn@xmath6 by 250 - 350 mev .",
    "1 describes the formation energy @xmath11h(mn@xmath7 ) of neutral substitutional mn in gaas as a function of the chemical potentials @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the shaded areas denote chemical potentials that produce unwanted products : ( i ) when @xmath14 becomes greater than zero ( the cohesive energy of solid as ) we have precipitation of elemental as as shown on the left hand side of fig .  1 .",
    "( ii ) in the opposite limit , when @xmath14 takes more negative values than the formation energy @xmath11h(gaas ) , we have maximally as - poor conditions and the host itself becomes unstable , as shown on the right hand side of fig .  1 .",
    "( iii ) the diagonal lines in the main body of fig .",
    "1 denote different values of @xmath13 .",
    "when the chemical potential of mn becomes greater than zero ( the cohesive energy of solid mn ) , metallic mn will precipitate as shown in the bottom right corner of fig .  1 .",
    "conversely , ( iv ) when @xmath13 becomes equal or larger than @xmath11h(mnas)-@xmath14 , we will precipitate a secondary phase of mnas . clearly , since @xmath12+@xmath14=@xmath11h(gaas ) and @xmath13+@xmath44  @xmath11h(mnas ) , one can keep the latter inequality even for moderately negative values of @xmath13 , provided that @xmath14 is adjusted . the lines in fig .",
    "1 show that the lowest @xmath11h(mn@xmath7 ) value is 0.91  ev ( circle at bottom left corner ) .",
    "this can be attained at @xmath14=0 ( maximally as - rich ) ; @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) .",
    "alternatively , the same solubility can be attained for less rich - as conditions , but richer mn conditions , _",
    "e.g. _ for @xmath14=-0.5 ev and @xmath13=-0.24 ev .    having described in fig .",
    "1 the stability of the _ neutral _ substitutional , we next describe in fig .",
    "2 the stability of the _ charged _ substitutionals . here we chose the chemical potentials @xmath14=0 , @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) ( denoted by the circle in fig",
    ".  1 ) and vary the fermi energy .",
    "we see that for @xmath2-type conditions , the lowest energy charge state is mn@xmath7 , whereas for higher fermi energy the stablest charge state is mn@xmath8 .",
    "table i gives the ( 0/- ) acceptor transition energy calculated with various supercell sizes with and without charge correction .",
    "the most converged ( 0/- ) transition energy calculated for the 216 atom cell and corrected for charge interactions is e@xmath9 + 0.13  ev , in good agreement with the measured value of e@xmath9 + 0.11  ev @xcite .",
    "2 shows that under epitaxial conditions ( right y - axis ) , the formation energy of mn@xmath7 is lowered by 0.74  ev .",
    "we next describe the electronic structure of mn@xmath0 . in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) we show the mn @xmath3 projected partial density of states ( pdos ) for two charge states of substitutional mn .",
    "the main features can be understood as arising from the hybridization between the anion dangling bonds generated by a ga vacancy and the @xmath3 levels on the mn ion placed at the vacant site @xcite .",
    "the mn @xmath3 ion levels are split by the tetrahedral crystal field into @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "exchange interactions further split these levels into spin - up ( @xmath47 ) and spin - down ( @xmath48 ) levels . the @xmath45 levels on the mn atom hybridize with the levels with the same symmetry on the as dangling bonds , while the @xmath46 levels have no other states available for significant coupling @xcite . because the location of the mn ion @xmath3 levels is below the dangling bond levels , after hybridization , the deeper bonding @xmath49 states have dominantly mn @xmath3 character ( refered to as cfr : `` crystal field resonance '' ) , while the higher antibonding @xmath49 states have dominantly as @xmath2 character ( refered to as dbh : `` dangling bond hybrid '' ) .",
    "these interactions lead to the energy level diagram depicted schematically on the left - hand - side of fig .  4 showing a fully occupied , mn - localized up - spin cfr of @xmath49 and @xmath50 symmetries . at a higher energy we have the up and down - spin dbh states with @xmath49 symmetry . because of the location of the ga vacancy states @xmath51 between the exchange split @xmath45 states on the mn , a negative exchange splitting is induced as a result of hybridization on the dbh states @xcite with @xmath52 below @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", the neutral substitutional defect mn@xmath4 has the electron configuration [ @xmath54@xmath55 ( @xmath56)@xmath57 , with a total magnetic moment @xmath58=4 @xmath59 , and a hole in the @xmath53 orbital .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the multiplet @xmath60t@xmath61 as observed in electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the partial occupancy of the negative exchange - split dbh states stabilizes the ferromagnetic state over the antiferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "mn interstitial can occupy a site with tetrahedral symmetry ( coordinated by four as or four ga atoms ) or a site with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "we have calculated the total energies of mn at these positions in a 64 atom cell of gaas , and the results for the tetrahedral interstitial sites are given in table ii .",
    "the tetrahedral interstitial mn@xmath1(as ) coordinated by four as atoms is more stable than the one coordinated by four ga atoms , with the difference being 0.16 , 0.31 and 0.31 ev for charge states @xmath17=1,2 and 3 .",
    "in contrast , the hexagonal interstitial has 0.62 ev higher total energy than the most stable mn@xmath15(as ) .",
    "experimentally , the presence of interstitial mn was detected by an analysis of the epr spectrum @xcite as well as by rutherford back scattering @xcite .",
    "the distinction between the two types of @xmath62 interstitial sites ( mn - next to as vs mn - next to ga ) is difficult to determine experimentally and involved an analysis of the experimentally measured contact interaction in terms of the covalency of the mn - x bond .",
    "this analysis suggested that mn@xmath1(ga ) was more stable , while our total energy calculations suggest that mn@xmath1(as ) is more stable .",
    "the formation energy of various charge states of interstitial mn is shown in fig .  2 for @xmath14=0 and @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) .",
    "we see that the stable charge state is mn@xmath6 for the full range of fermi level , with maximum stability at @xmath5=0 . to compare the relative stability of mn@xmath6 at @xmath5=0 with substitutional mn@xmath7",
    ", we show in the upper scale of fig .",
    "1 the difference @xmath11h(mn@xmath6 ) - @xmath11h(mn@xmath7 ) between the formation energies of interstitial and substitutional mn . we see that substitutional ga is stabler on the left hand side of the figure , _",
    "i.e _ sufficiently as - rich , whereas interstitial mn is stabler at the right hand side of the figure , _",
    "i.e. _ sufficiently as - poor .",
    "the energy difference is @xmath63 for @xmath14=0 , the substitutional mn are stabler by 0.38  ev , while for moderately as - rich conditions , say @xmath14 = -0.4  ev , both defects have comparable formation energies",
    ".    these results are in agreement with recent experiments using liquid phase epitaxy @xcite to introduce mn in gaas .",
    "experimentally a decrease in hole concentration is found as the mn concentration is increased . under the ga - rich growth conditions used , as antisites are not expected to be the dominant source of the observed compensation .",
    "hence the major source of compensation is believed to come from mn@xmath1 as expected for ga - rich conditions from fig .  1 .",
    "we next examine the electronic structure of mn at a tetrahedral interstitial site .",
    "when mn occupies a tetrahedral interstitial position , five of the seven electrons occupy the @xmath64 cfr levels , with the remaining two going into the down - spin @xmath65 levels .",
    "this is evident from the pdos for the doubly - ionized mn@xmath6 shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , where mn@xmath6 is found to have the configuration [ @xmath54@xmath55 with a magnetic moment of @xmath58=5@xmath59 . the central panel of fig .",
    "4(a ) shows schematically the levels of mn@xmath1 . as the ( 0/+ ) and ( + /2 + ) transitions are calculated to lie inside the gaas conduction band ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we conclude that mn@xmath1 produce free electrons in gaas .",
    "having dealt with the isolated limit , we investigated whether mn atoms show a tendency to cluster .",
    "recent experiments @xcite on dilute magnetic semiconductors have found a strong tendency of the doped transition metal atoms to cluster and there has been some theoretical work @xcite to support such observations .",
    "we consider as - centred clusters [ ( as)mn@xmath66ga@xmath67 with @xmath68=0,1,2,3 and 4 .",
    "5 shows the formation energy of clusters made of three substitutional mn atoms ( s - s - s ) at lattice locations ( 0,0,0 ) , ( a/2,a/2,0 ) and ( 0,a/2,a/2 ) in the 64 atom supercell .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath68=3 cluster .",
    "here @xmath39 is the cubic lattice constant of gaas .",
    "we see that the neutral cluster ( 3  mn@xmath0)@xmath69 having three holes is stable under @xmath2-type conditions , whereas the charged cluster ( 3mn@xmath0)@xmath70 with 2 holes is more stable above @xmath5 = 0.15 ev .",
    "the energies of the complex with 3(mn@xmath0)@xmath69 is 2.2 + 3(@xmath12 - @xmath13 ) ev while that of three noninteracting mn@xmath0 in their lowest energy charge state is 2.71 + 3(@xmath12 - @xmath13 ) ev . for epitaxial conditions",
    "@xmath11h@xmath71=0.02 + 3(@xmath12 - @xmath13 ) ev / cluster .",
    "thus , as the formation energy is very low , the tendency for the mn atoms to cluster is strongly enhanced under epitaxial growth conditions .    in order to obtain a measure of the tendency to cluster",
    ", we calculate the clustering energy .",
    "the `` clustering energy '' @xmath72 is defined as the energy difference between n substitutional mn atoms surrounding an as site [ ( as)mn@xmath66ga@xmath73 ; @xmath74 and n isolated well - separated constituents .",
    "thus , @xmath75-n[e(1)-e(0)]$ ] , where e(n ) is the total energy of the supercell with as - centered clusters of n mn atoms .",
    "we find that @xmath76(n)= -228 , -482 and -794 mev per cluster of n=2,3 and 4 mn atoms for a 64 atom supercell .",
    "the clustering energy changed to -519 , -1069 mev for clusters involving 2 and 3 mn in a 256 atom supercell .",
    "these results indicate a strong tendency for the neutral substitutional mn atoms to form clusters .",
    "we considered the defect complex formed between mn@xmath0 ( s ) and interstitial mn@xmath1 ( i ) denoted as ( s - i - s)@xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the total charge of the complex .",
    "the geometry for the complex had mn@xmath0 at ( 0,0,0 ) and ( a/2,a/2,0 ) and mn@xmath1 at ( a/2,0,0 ) in the 64 atom supercell of gaas .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "5 that s - i - s exists in two charge states : when the fermi energy is below e@xmath9 + 0.1 ev we have the stable structure is ( s - i - s)@xmath79 , whereas when @xmath5 is above it , the stable structure is the neutral ( s - i - s)@xmath69 .",
    "thus , the donor transition for the cluster is at e@xmath9 + 0.1 ev .",
    "5 also shows that for fermi levels below e@xmath9 + 0.22 ev , the s - i - s complex is stabler than the s - s - s complex . as for the interaction energy of the components of the complex : the formation energy of the non - interacting neutral ( @xmath80 ) components of the complex is 2e(mn@xmath4)+e(mn@xmath81)=4.31 + 2@xmath12  -  3@xmath13 ev per 3 impurities , while the formation energy of the _ interacting _ neutral complex is 1.41 + 2@xmath12 - 3@xmath13 ev .",
    "this represents a @xmath38 2.9 ev per 3 impurities stabilization over the non - interacting , neutral defects .",
    "the energy of the neutral complex measured with respect to the stablest lattice site occupied by isolated mn under particular experimental conditions is found to be -574 mev for @xmath14=0 ev , @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) and @xmath5=0 ev .",
    "hence this complex is strongly stabilized .",
    "the reasons for the stability of the ( s - i - s)@xmath69 complex can be appreciated from fig .",
    "4(a ) . upon bringing together 2mn@xmath7 with mn@xmath81 ,",
    "one electron drops from the higher energy @xmath82 level of mn@xmath1 to the lower energy @xmath83 level of each substitutional site , resulting in @xmath84_{cfr}(t_{\\downarrow}^3t_{\\uparrow}^3)_{dbh}$ ] configuration at each mn@xmath0 site ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) which corresponds to mn@xmath8 .",
    "these conclusions are evident from our calculated dos of the s - i - s complex , projected on the i and s sites shown in fig .",
    "we find that for both @xmath78=0 ( fig .",
    "6(a ) ) and @xmath78=2 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) the i site has the configuration @xmath85_{cfr}$ ] or `` @xmath86 '' . this substitutional - to - interstitial charge transfer lowers the energy of the complex by twice the separation between @xmath82 level of mn@xmath1 and @xmath83 level of mn@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it creates a favorable coulomb attraction between the components s@xmath70-i@xmath10-s@xmath70 of the complex .",
    "this energetically favorable substitutional - interstitial association reaction then eliminates the holes that were present in isolated substitutional mn@xmath0 and could explain the puzzling observation @xcite of the existence of a far lower concentration of holes than mn in gaas .",
    "alternate explanations such as the presence of as antisites @xcite as well as the presence of mn atoms connected to six as atoms ( as in the nias structure ) have been offered . however , samples have been prepared where the concentration of as antisites is too low to explain the observed compensation of holes .",
    "further , six - fold coordinated mn atoms have not been observed in mn doped gaas samples @xcite .",
    "the neutral complex has two mn@xmath8 and one intervening `` @xmath86 '' interstitial .",
    "we find that a ferromagnetic arrangement between mn@xmath0 is favored in the complex ( @xmath88)@xmath69 by 176 mev .",
    "in contrast , our calculations for two mn@xmath8 atoms _ without _ the intervening interstitial atom finds that an _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ arrangement of spins on the substitutional mn atoms is favored by 108 mev .",
    "thus mn@xmath1 is responsible for mediating a ferromagnetic interaction between mn@xmath7 .",
    "how does the presence of the interstitial mn mediate the alignment of spins on the substitutional mn ?",
    "there are three possible arrangements for the spins on the mn atoms making up the neutral complex - ( s@xmath89i@xmath89s@xmath89)@xmath69 , ( s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath89)@xmath69 and ( s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath90)@xmath69 . from our total energy calculations we find that the energy for the configurations ( s@xmath89i@xmath89s@xmath89)@xmath69 and ( s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath90)@xmath69 are higher by 563 mev and 176 mev , respectively , than the energy , e@xmath91 , of the ground state ( s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath89)@xmath69 .",
    "( the energies changed marginally to 602  mev and 192  mev respectively when we increased the supercell size to 256 atoms . )",
    "the stabilization of the s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath89 magnetic arrangement can be understood using simple arguments : in the configuration ( s@xmath89i@xmath89s@xmath89)@xmath69 , as one spin channel is completely filled , there is no channel of hopping available for the electrons to delocalize and lower their energy .",
    "thus , this is a high energy spin configuration with energy e@xmath91 + 563 mev .",
    "in contrast , in the configuration ( s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath90)@xmath69 , two channels of hopping are present ; the first between the electrons on s@xmath89 and s@xmath90 , and the second between those on s@xmath89 and i@xmath90 .",
    "this configuration is found to have the energy , e@xmath91 + 176 mev .",
    "likewise , the configuration ( s@xmath89i@xmath90s@xmath89 ) which has energy e@xmath91 has two channels of hopping present between s and i. the dominant factor in determining the configuration which has the lowest energy are the hopping matrix elements - v@xmath92 between s and i and v@xmath93 between the two s. to a first approximation , these hopping matrix elements are determined by the separation between the atoms involved . as the distance between the two substitutional mn atoms is @xmath94 times the distance between s and i",
    ", the effective hopping matrix element between s is smaller .",
    "hence the presence of an intervening mn@xmath1 provides a channel for the ferromagnetic arrangement of spins between two mn@xmath0 even in the neutral charge - compensated complex . in contrast , the presence of a closed shell donor such as as@xmath0 between two mn@xmath0 gives rise to an antiferromagnetic ( or weakly ferromagnetic ) interaction between mn@xmath0 .",
    "how does the presence of the interstitial affect long - range ferromagnetism ? in order to investigate this we introduced a hole - producing , isolated substitutional mn atom at different lattice locations , indicated in fig . 7 , and investigated whether the spin on this isolated substitutional mn atom prefers to align parallel or antiparallel with respect to the spins on the substitutional mn atoms within the s - i - s cluster .",
    "we find that the substitutional mn likes to align ferromagnetically with the mn@xmath0 of the cluster by 147 , 214 and 81 mev , respectively for the positions 1 , 2 and 3 ( see fig .",
    "hence the presence of the interstitial mn forces a hole which is located @xmath38 12 @xmath40 from the s - i - s cluster to align ferromagnetically and therefore contributes to the long - ranged ferromagnetism observed in these systems .    as discussed earlier",
    ", the basic electronic structure of substitutional mn in gaas can be understood as arising from the hopping interaction between the mn @xmath3 states and the as @xmath2 dangling bond states .",
    "therefore , the coupling between two mn atoms is through the as @xmath2 states .",
    "it is strongest along the directions in which the `` @xmath95 '' coupling of the mn with the as states is the largest and decreases with distance along that direction . when there is a hole , the antibonding @xmath96 orbitals are partially occupied , and there is ferromagnetism .",
    "hence in fig .",
    "7 spins on the mn atoms at sites 2 and 3 prefer to align ferromagnetically with the spins on s when there is partial compensation .",
    "this could happen either because the s - i - s cluster is totally compensated , and a hole exists on the mn at sites 2/3 or the s - i - s cluster is partially compensated .",
    "the mechanism stabilizing the ferromagnetic coupling between s and site 1 is the same as what we discussed for the ( s - i - s)@xmath69 complex earlier and exists even when there is total compensation .",
    "while the neutral complex has no holes , the @xmath78=+1 and + 2 complexes have 1 and 2 holes respectively ( fig .",
    "4(c ) ) and a net magnetic moment of 4 and 3 @xmath59 respectively . for @xmath78=+2 , mn@xmath0 adopts the configuration mn@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "4(c ) ) . we find that ( mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0)@xmath10 prefers the ferromagnetic arrangement of spins on mn@xmath0 by 286  mev , similar to the ferromagnetic preference ( @xmath38 305 mev ) of mn@xmath7-mn@xmath7 pair without an intervening mn@xmath1 .",
    "these results suggest the surprising fact that the spins on mn@xmath0 align ferromagnetically in the charged complexes , almost as if mn@xmath1 did not exist .",
    "the number of holes in the cluster is the same as the number in the pair , though the number of mn atoms are different .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental observation @xcite where above a critical concentration of mn , both the number of holes as well as the ferromagnetic transition temperature remain constant , while the magnetic moment per mn atom decreases @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments that we obtain for the @xmath78=+1 and + 2 charge states translate into average moments of 1.33 @xmath59 and 1 @xmath59 per mn , while the uncompensated pair of mn@xmath0 have a magnetic moment of 4 @xmath59 . in this regime where the @xmath97 is found to saturate ,",
    "the average magnetic moment per mn is found to vary from @xmath38 3 @xmath59 at a mn concentration of 5.54 @xmath98 to 1.74 at 8.3 @xmath98 .",
    "recent experiments @xcite find that the @xmath97 of the as - grown samples increased after annealing .",
    "this was interpreted as the migration of fm - reducing _ interstitial _ mn to fm - enhancing _ substitutional _ positions .",
    "we investigated which clusters could break by annealing and promote ferromagnetism .",
    "as the s - i - s complexes are rather strongly bound with respect to their constituents , we investigated instead complexes s - i , which are bound weakly ( @xmath38 -196 mev in the + 1 charge state for @xmath14 , @xmath13=@xmath11h(mnas ) and @xmath5=0 ev ) .",
    "we find antiferromagnetic spin arrangement in all @xmath78=0 , + 1 , + 2 and + 3 charge states considered .",
    "thus , when these weakly bound s - i clusters are broken , depending on the charge state , there could be an increase in the number of holes and consequently the ferromagnetic transition temperature .",
    "on the other hand , s - i - s clusters appear to be stable and hence do not disintegrate under annealing .",
    "under as - rich conditions , mn prefers to substitute the ga site .",
    "as the growth conditions become less as - rich , or as extrinsic doping pushes @xmath5 towards and even below the vbm , the formation energy of interstitial mn becomes competitive with that of substitutional mn . under coherent epitaxial growth conditions ,",
    "when mnas precipitates are forced to be coherent with the zinc - blende lattice , the formation energy of both substitutional and interstitial decrease . at this point , the solubility is large enough to form clusers .",
    "we find that s - i - s clusters are more stable than s - s - s clusters .",
    "s - i - s clusters are found to be strongly bound with respect to their constituents and exhibit partial or total hole compensation . while isolated mn@xmath1 behaves like a hole - killer and",
    "is expected to destroy ferromagnetism , in ( mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0)@xmath69 , the mn@xmath1 is found to mediate the ferromagnetic arrangement of spins on mn@xmath0 .",
    "the charged complex ( mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0)@xmath10 has a similar ferromagnetic stabilization energy on the two mn@xmath0 sites as in mn@xmath7-mn@xmath7 cluster without mn@xmath1 _ almost as if mn@xmath1 did not exist_. thus ferromagnetism in mn doped gaas arises from holes due to substitutional mn@xmath0 , as well as from mn@xmath0-mn@xmath1-mn@xmath0 complexes .",
