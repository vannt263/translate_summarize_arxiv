    "much attention has been given to studying the transport of particles along narrow channels @xcite .",
    "such strong confinement occurs for example in the ion channels of biological membranes @xcite , in zeolites and other porous materials @xcite and in microfluidic devices @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of colloidal particles confined within grooves etched on a surface @xcite have already addressed the case when confinement is so extreme that particles can not pass one another and so single - file diffusion sets in @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the motion of a file occurs in the presence of a periodic pinning potential .",
    "the latter can be induced , for instance , by defects , such as in the case of superconducting vortices moving in easy - flow channels @xcite , by other particles , as in the case of a fluctuating quasi-1-dimensional ( 1d ) channel @xcite , by a periodic distribution of charges , as in the case of the motor proteins moving along a microtubulus @xcite , or , more generally , by a periodic corrugation of the channel walls @xcite . when the left - right symmetry of the pinning potential is broken , an externally applied center - symmetric ac drive induces a net drift of the file in a certain direction .",
    "the efficiency of such a rectification mechanism strongly depends on the number of particles in the file , their size , and frequency of the drive @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interaction with the channel , the colloids have an excluded volume interaction between them @xcite and may also exhibit mutual attraction , either due to van der waals forces @xcite or because of the presence of other passive molecules in the solution , such as in the case of colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that attractive forces lead to the formation of particle clusters and , consequently , to a dramatic increase in particle diffusion and mobility @xcite .",
    "such enhancement is explained by the mismatch between the size of the particle clusters and the characteristic length scale of the corrugated potential induced by the walls of the channel . in the case of the diffusion of long alkane chains in zeolites",
    ", a similar phenomenon is called the  window effect \" @xcite , namely , the mobility of the alkane chain becomes enhanced , whenever its length is not commensurate with the zeolite cage . more generally , the incommensurability between the lateral dimensions of a biological molecule and the size of a catalyst is known as  shape selectivity \" @xcite , a recurrent scheme utilized by nature to control enzymatic reactions in living cells .",
    "recently , we have developed a theory @xcite , based on dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite , that captures the essential features of the condensation process from the disordered to the condensed state in a randomly distributed single - file of interacting particles .",
    "pair attraction can be used to enhance the transport of colloidal particles in 1d .",
    "for instance , entrained attracting particles can be effectively shuttled along an asymmetric corrugated channel by means of a low frequency ac field .",
    "collective shuttling of entrained particles directly applies to the problem of diffusion of long molecular chains in zeolites and shape selective catalytic reactions in living cells . in particular , we stress that collective shuttles can be much more efficient than some other shuttle mechanisms , as they allow one to control the rate of transport by adding ( removing ) a single molecule to ( from ) the molecular chain .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : our main goal is to analyze the effects of the pair attraction between the particles on the rectification current of single - files of colloidal particles which are confined within a narrow channel with corrugated walls and subjected to dc or ac drives . the general theoretical framework for our analysis of our model system , which is based on ddft , is presented in sec.[ddft ] .",
    "the one body density distribution @xmath0 of the diffusing particles , which is a function of position @xmath1 and time @xmath2 , obeys a nonlinear fokker - planck equation and ddft @xcite provides a closure approximation that allows us to solve for the dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "the ddft dynamical equation for the system takes the form of a conserved gradient dynamics , which requires as input a suitable approximation for the helmholtz free energy functional for the system @xcite . in the presence of a dc drive",
    ", the free energy contains a potential energy term proportional to @xmath1 that acts as a continuous external energy source , i.e. , the system remains permanently out of thermodynamic equilibrium . in consequence ,",
    "the free energy of a single - file of interacting particles is not necessarily a monotonically decreasing function of time .",
    "therefore , the system can exhibit stable time - periodic density profiles and currents .",
    "in particular , in secs[cond ] and [ dc ] we discuss the relation of the onset of time - periodic density variations to the condensation of particles into compact clusters and the depinning of these clusters from the channel corrugations .    in sec.[zerolength",
    "] we examine the dynamics of point - like particles and we demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by attraction leads to the coexistence of stable time - periodic and stationary densities .",
    "multistability of the long - time density distributions indicates that for the same combination of parameters in our model , the channel can operate in two different regimes , transporting the particles with either high or low efficiency . for finite - size particles the range of values of the system parameters that allows for time - periodic density profiles , is much broader than for point - like particles , as explained in sec.[finitelength ] .    in sec.[acdrive",
    "] we discuss the low frequency rectification current for particles driven by an ac ( square wave ) drive through a channel with a spatially asymmetric potential . in sec.[currmax ] we show that the effect of the spatial asymmetry is that the rectification current may be maximized , using the strength of the attraction between the particles as the control parameter . in sec.[strongatt ] we derive an effective equation of motion for a condensate in the limit of infinitely strong attraction between the particles .",
    "we show that the low frequency transport efficiency can be increased by several orders of magnitude for strongly attracting particles as compared to non - interacting particles . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we close with a few concluding remarks .",
    "when finite sized colloids are confined within a long narrow channel , the particle motion becomes one dimensional , and the particles can be modeled as 1d hard rods of length @xmath3 .",
    "we model the dynamics of @xmath4 hard rods using overdamped stochastic equations of motion .",

    "the total instantaneous potential energy of the @xmath4 rods , which move in the periodic external potential @xmath6 under the action of a time - dependent external drive @xmath12 , is : @xmath13+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j \\neq i } w(| x_i -x_j |),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the interaction potential between a pair of particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , which are located at positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and are separated by the distance @xmath20 . in general , the potential @xmath14 can be decomposed into two terms .",
    "one accounts for the attraction ( denoted by subscript `` at '' ) between the particles and the other for the hardcore repulsion ( subscript `` hc '' ) , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "the hard - core repulsive potential ensures that the rods are impenetrable , that is , @xmath22 we assume that @xmath23 becomes negligible at distances @xmath1 much larger than a certain effective interaction range @xmath24 .",
    "the overdamped dynamics of the particles is described by @xmath4 coupled langevin equations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the temperature of the system and @xmath27 are independent gaussian white noises with the correlation functions @xmath28 .",
    "henceforth we set the solvent friction constant @xmath29 .    in the case of a circular geometry , eqs.([langevin ] ) are supplemented with periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) with the period equal to the system size @xmath5 .",
    "this requires that all functions in eqs.([langevin ] ) are periodic with period @xmath5 .",
    "this is not the case if the contribution to the interaction potential @xmath14 from the potential @xmath30 is long ranged , as particles would interact then with themselves .",
    "however , @xmath14 can be made compatible with the desired periodic bc by taking the interaction range @xmath24 to be sufficiently small compared with the system size .",

    "it should be emphasized that the functional in eq.([hr_energy ] ) , is strictly only exact for 1d equilibrium systems of hard - rods treated in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "however , as the ( average ) number of particles in a system is increased , the difference between results from treating a system canonically or grand canonically diminishes , so that the theory can safely be extended to describe single - files with a fixed but large numbers of rods .    in earlier work",
    ", the ddft approach was used to study the dynamics of an ensemble of pure hard rods ( i.e.  with no attractive interactions ) @xcite .",

    "formal similarities between thin film equations and some fokker - planck equations for interacting particles have recently been pointed out in the case of spatially - asymmetric ratchets with a temporal ac drive @xcite . in the present case , we find that some of our results are similar to results for the case of liquid drops on horizontal @xcite and inclined @xcite heterogenous solid substrates .",
    "these similarities arise due to ( i ) the similar gradient dynamics form of the evolution equation for the conserved field ( here @xmath50 ) , ( ii ) the presence of similar physical effects .",
    "the role of the attractive and repulsive force between particles is taken by the partial wettability of the liquid @xcite ; the stabilizing role of diffusion is played by surface tension ; the channel corrugations are similar to substrate heterogeneities ; the dc drive corresponds to constant driving parallel to the substrate ( e.g. , drop on an incline ) ; and the present ac drive is similar to substrate vibrations @xcite or oscillating electric fields @xcite .    here",

    "the system remains permanently out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "therefore , in an infinite domain or in a finite domain with periodic bc , the non - equilibrium dynamics of the system with dc drive is not relaxational , in contrast to the case of zero - flux bc that would correspond to a closed finite system @xcite .",

    "the emerging time - periodic branch is unstable and will not be further considered here .",
    "the only stable solutions with spatial period equal to the system size , @xmath171 , are the time - periodic ones , which correspond along most of the branch to a single compact cluster of particles traveling in the direction of the drive .",
    "close to the hopf bifurcation , it resembles a small amplitude wave moving ` on top ' of the stationary @xmath163 state .",

    "in contrast to the case @xmath194 , the time - periodic branch continues toward large @xmath80 . in other words , for @xmath200 all @xmath161-periodic solutions are depinned . in fig.[f4a](c ) we see that time - periodic solutions have on average a lower free energy than the stable stationary @xmath172-periodic solutions .",
    "however , as the system is permanently out of equilibrium , in general , the solution of lower free energy is not necessarily the one that the system converges to in the long time @xmath204 limit .",

    "within the shaded area , the condensate is pinned by the effective external potential @xmath259 ; depinning occurs either to the left or to the right , depending on the drive orientation .",
    "note that for @xmath260 , the right and left critical amplitudes coincide with the single particle depinning thresholds , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , introduced in sec .",
    "similarly to the case for pointlike particles @xcite , selecting an appropriate combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one can achieve the complete locking of the condensed mode in one direction , but not in the other @xcite , which yields the upper bound @xmath261 for the modulus of @xmath212 .    finally , using eq.([langevin2 ] ) , we compare in fig.[f6 ] the efficiency of the low frequency transport of strongly attracting ( @xmath245 ) and non - interacting ( @xmath262 ) particles .",
    "we fix the size of the particles @xmath3 and change the average density @xmath263 by changing the number of particles @xmath4 in the system .",
    "the unidirectional currents for the condensate oscillate with @xmath4 and hit the respective upper ( lower ) bound , @xmath264 , for @xmath208 equal to a multiple of @xmath7 . in the absence of particle attraction ,",
    "@xmath265 increases monotonically with @xmath4 and attain the same upper bound only for @xmath266 .",
    "the corresponding rectification currents are shown in fig.[f6](b ) . for certain combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the magnitude of the current of the condensate is several orders of magnitude larger than for non - attracting particles .",
    "in this paper we have developed a ddft for studying the dynamics of a file of attracting colloidal particles confined within a channel that exerts a periodic ratchet potential on the colloids .",
    "we find that the attraction between the colloids leads to rather rich behavior in the ddft model when the particles are driven , including transitions from stationary to time - periodic density profiles as the strength of the attraction between the particles is increased .",
    "we also find that for strong enough attraction , there can be coexistence of stable stationary density profiles with different spatial periods and time - periodic density profiles , each with different values for the particle current @xmath67 .    these dynamical transitions in our model stem from the fact that the approximate free energy functional on which our ddft is based , predicts that the system exhibits gas - liquid phase separation for sufficiently large values of the ratio @xmath267 .",
    "this prediction comes as a consequence of the mean - field approximation made in constructing the free energy . in reality , for a system containing a finite number of particles , there is no true phase transition .",
    "furthermore , since the system is one - dimensional , there is no phase transition even in the infinite sized system ( i.e  in the thermodynamic limit when @xmath268 , with average density @xmath269 remaining constant ) . in 1d systems such as",
    "that studied here , as the attraction strength @xmath80 is increased , the particles increasingly tend to gather together , but no true phase transition can be defined .",
    "thus , in reality , as can be inferred from our brownian dynamics simulation results , there are no ` sharp ' transitions from the pinned to the depinned ( time - periodic ) state , as @xmath80 is increased .",
    "thus , we expect that fluctuations will round the predicted transitions .",
    "nonetheless , as the comparison with the brownian dynamics simulations show , the results from our ddft do capture the main features of the system - i.e.  that for lower values of the attraction strength @xmath80 , the particles are uniformly distributed and that at higher values of @xmath80 the particles gather to form a cluster , and that if the system length @xmath5 is sufficiently long , this clustering leads to time - periodic currents @xmath67 when the system is driven .    in our discussions",
    "above we have pointed out that similarities exist between the ddft equation for the particle density employed here and thin film equations that are used to model the dynamics of films and drops of partially wetting liquids on heterogenous solid substrates with and without additional driving forces @xcite .",
    "the similarities result from the fact that in both cases kinetic equations for conserved fields are used , and that the respective free energy functionals contain terms which result in similar physical effects .",
    "for instance , the role of the particle - particle interactions in the present work is taken by wettability effects in the context of droplet dynamics .",
    "the parallels between the two systems have allowed us to use the knowledge gained from studying one system to understand aspects of the other .",
    "in particular , in the present work we have drawn on the understanding of depinning mechanisms developed for thin films in refs .  @xcite . furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that one might encounter rich nonlinear behaviour when considering the behaviour of attractive hard - core particles in wider corrugated channels , i.e. , without the ` restriction ' of single file motion .",
    "note , however , that there are clear limits to the similarities : the thin film models referred to above do not account for any effect that is equivalent to the freezing instability discussed above .",
    "we believe that studying in detail the similarities and differences between ddft and thin film models is worthwhile , as it will allow for much cross fertilisation of ideas and techniques between the two fields .",
    "one of the most striking features of our system is that the current @xmath67 depends very sensitively on the size of the particles @xmath3 and on the total number of particles in the system @xmath4 , particularly when the particles are strongly attracted to one another so that they are bound together to form a cluster that moves as a unit through the system , when there is an external drive on the system .",
    "in fact , the direction of travel can be completely reversed when the system is driven by an ac potential , simply by changing the number of particles in the file by one ",
    "i.e.  adding an extra particle to a file can cause it to reverse its direction of motion without changing the external drive .",
    "this means that one can use the present system to form a molecular shuttle that moves back and forth between two docking stations , loading and unloading single particles from a source to a sink docking station @xcite .",
    "as the process repeats , a steady flux is established along the channel .",
    "this mechanism can be highly efficient if the system parameters are carefully tuned .",
    "the present model thus provides a useful system for developing a deep understanding of the behavior of driven macromolecular and colloidal systems occurring in nanoscience and biology .",
    "in particular , by using ddft , which is based on a fully microscopic expression for the helmholtz free energy functional , we are able to build into our theory a reliable description of the correlations between the particles , and their influence on the dynamics of the system as a whole .",
