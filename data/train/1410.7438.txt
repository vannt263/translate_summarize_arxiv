    "the simulations analysed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have one crucial aspect in common : each group used a variant of the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) to identify and group their dark matter particles into haloes .",

    "identifying dark matter haloes as groups of particles within simulation data is a challenging affair , and there are numerous codes with different feature sets employing different algorithms . @xcite compared a number of halo finders in both cosmological and idealized scenarios .",
    "overall , they found most to be in agreement with one another , with only subtle variations among the results .",
    "but in detail and for specific types of systems , the differences can be substantial .",
    "here we employ two popular group finding algorithms to group dark matter particles into haloes : a friends - of - friends algorithm , and a six - dimensional phase - space halo finder .",
    "the fof algorithm used in this study is a simplified version of the parallel friends - of - friends group finder subfind @xcite with the post - processing subfind algorithm disabled .",
    "the code groups the particles into dm haloes if their positions lie within a specified linking length . this linking length is a fraction of the initial mean inter - particle separation , for which we adopt a standard value of @xmath51 @xcite . additional groupings with",

    "we also use a six - dimensional phase - space algorithm called rockstar  ( hereafter rs ; * ? ? ?",

    "rs initially divides the simulation into 3d friends - of - friends groups using a @xmath53 .",
    "the velocity and positions of each halo are then normalized by the group position and velocity dispersions , which gives rise to a natural phase - space metric .",
    "next , a phase - space linking length is adaptively chosen such that 70% of the group s particles are linked together in subgroups ; the normalization process is then repeated for each subgroup .",
    "once all levels of substructure are found , seed haloes are placed at the lowest substructure levels and particles are assigned hierarchically to the closest seed halo in phase space . finally , unbound particles are removed from the group .",

    "the algorithm however , is not without weaknesses . in major mergers or",
    "when sub - haloes lie close to the centers of their host haloes , the density contrast is not strong enough to distinguish which particles belong to which halo . if the two haloes have some relative motion , six - dimensional halo finders ( such as rs ) can additionally use particle velocity information to determine halo membership @xcite .",

    "the mass functions of the two halo finders match remarkably well .",
    "this agreement is not surprising , because the virial masses calculated by rs include all substructure and should be comparable to the fof halo masses .",
    "we truncate the fof halo mass function at 32 particles , but we show the rs mass function below this in order to visualize the level of incompleteness owing to poor numerical resolution at low halo masses ; we will only be concerned with haloes @xmath56 , above which the mass function is not limited by our resolution , and in this regime there is little difference in the mass function between the two codes .    the black dashed line in figure  [ fig : massfunc ] is the @xcite dm halo mass function at @xmath55 .",
    "our simulations with both groupings slightly underpredict with regards to analytic theory at the low - mass end , and slightly over predict at the high - mass end .",

    "the overall distribution is gaussian - like , with a peak at @xmath72 .",

    ". hence such high velocities are only likely to arise in systems that are merging towards each other .    the probability for a _",
    "pair is the area under this curve above the velocity threshold , divided by the total area under the curve . because this high pairwise velocity tail is sampled by a small number of haloes owing to the limited simulation volume",
    ", it may not be a fair representation of the true statistics to simply count pairs above this threshold .",
    "one approach to mitigate this is to fit the pdf with an analytic function and integrate this function out to infinity .",
    "previous works have used a gaussian for this purpose @xcite , but @xcite argues for the use of  extreme value statistics \" ( evs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) since the extreme tail of the pdf can deviate significantly from a gaussian .",
    "here we instead follow the approach of fitting a skewed gaussian , but we force the fit to be very good particularly for the pdf above @xmath74 .",
    "this is accomplished by allowing large fitting errors at @xmath75 , and small ones at @xmath31 .",
    "a least - square - fit then obtains a very good fit at high velocities , at the expense of a poorer fit at lower velocities .",
    "however , we do not need to use the fit at lower velocities , since there we can directly count pairs within a large and representative sample .",
    "we then calculate the probability of finding a _",

    "our p@xmath78 is slightly larger than the value calculated by @xcite which may be due to our simplified approach .",
    "if we run the same analysis on fof groupings with @xmath52 as opposed to @xmath51 , we find p@xmath79 , which is slightly smaller than the value of p@xmath40 that @xcite obtained using @xmath51 for their fof groupings . regardless of this difference",
    ", p@xmath80 remains almost two orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates using fof .",
    "repeating the same exercise on the smaller boxes results in similar probabilities .",
    "for the l3214 run , we find p@xmath81 and p@xmath82 . and",
    "p@xmath83 and p@xmath84 for the l1607 run .",
    "note that the distribution gets noisier with decreasing box size , hence the probabilities become more unreliable .",
    "even so , the probabilities remain roughly similar in order of magnitude , showing that this approach is stable against reasonable box size variations .",
    "if we instead employ evs and fit a generalized pareto distribution ( gpd ) of the form @xmath85 as was done in @xcite , we find that the probabilities do not differ drastically from our above described method .",

    "these fits are shown in figure  [ fig : gpd ] for our largest simulation as the dashed lines . integrating these from 3000 @xmath90 to infinity we find p@xmath91 and p@xmath92 , which are different by a factor of 1.02 and 1.45 when compared to our skewed normal fits .",
    "these minor differences indicate that our method is sufficient at fitting the high-@xmath20 tail of the distribution .    in figure",

    "the pdfs are very similar for @xmath93 , but above this value the rs probability increases markedly relative to fof , such that by @xmath94 it is two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the ratio of rs & fof pdfs in the l3214 and l1607 runs have the same trend as the l6249 run , suggesting that the statistical relation between massive rs & fof velocity pairs does not vary drastically even in volumes as small as @xmath95 .    using the methods described above , we impose an additional mass criteria of @xmath96 ( mb08 ) and calculate the probability of finding a _ massive , high-@xmath20 _ halo pair within our largest volume to be p@xmath97 and p@xmath98 .",

    "rs bullet - like candidates # 1 and # 2 are each grouped into a single fof halo . pair three however , is identified as two separate fof groups , but with a @xmath20 that is less than half of its rs counterpart ( and hence fails to meet the _ massive , high-@xmath20 _ criteria ) .",
    "we note that we used @xmath51 to group fof haloes ; if we had used the canonical value of @xmath52 , fof identifies system # 3 as a single group .    by visualizing these systems",
    "we can better understand the differences between rs and fof . in figure",

    "arrows indicate the mean velocity of the rs - identified particles within a given bin minus the bulk velocity of the corresponding ( single ) fof halo .",
    "the directions and magnitudes of the different rs groupings provides clear evidence that the single object identified by fof is indeed two separate objects when viewed in velocity space .",
    "we do not show fof velocity information , but it is very similar to that of rs since the actual particles grouped into rs and fof haloes are quite similar ; the difference is that , by using velocity information , rs is able to separate these systems into two distinct haloes whereas fof ( which does not use velocity information ) lumps them into one .",

    "we further show the median velocity vectors for both fof - identified particles ( red ) and rs - identified particles ( blue ) . while some bins have similar mean velocities , others are considerably different from one another .",
    "most notably , two of the dark center bins where the majority of the mass lies show nearly opposing velocity vectors between fof and rs .",
    "what has happened is that there are multiple objects in this region , and fof has overgrouped them resulting in a velocity much closer to that of the main halo ( not shown ) .",

    "the overgrouping results in an fof halo that is @xmath130 more massive than the rs counterpart , and double in radius .",

    "the overall bulk velocity can easily get washed out .",
    "consider this simple example : two head - on merging haloes are grouped together ; their bulk velocities would effectively cancel out leading to a much lower bulk velocity for the final group .",

    "<S> we find that algorithms that do not account for the kinematics of infalling groups yield vastly different statistics and probabilities . when employing the rockstar  halo finder that considers particle velocities , we find numerous bullet - like pair candidates that closely match not only the high pairwise velocity , but also the mass , mass ratio , separation distance , and collision angle of the initial conditions that have been shown to produce the bullet cluster in non - cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of finding a high pairwise velocity pair among haloes with @xmath2 is @xmath3 using rockstar , while it is @xmath4 lower using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) based approach as in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the typical spatial extent of bullet progenitors is such that fof tends to group them into a single halo despite clearly distinct kinematics . further requiring an appropriately high average mass among the two progenitors , we find the comoving number density of potential bullet - like candidates to be on the order of @xmath5 . </S>",
