    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are some of the most luminous objects in the universe , frequently outshining their host galaxies . historically agns have been classified based on their optical and radio characteristics and",
    "were originally believed to be a variety of completely different objects .",
    "it is now thought that all agns share a common central engine : an accreting supermassive black hole ( smbh ) located at the center of its host galaxy .",
    "angle - dependance and obscuration can explain some of the observed differences in these objects but are not enough to explain the great variety of agn properties that have been discovered .",
    "agns display a wide variety of observed behaviors , making it difficult to place them neatly into categories .",
    "the most general distinction between agn types is jet - dominated versus non jet - dominated .",
    "blazars , which are radio bright with typically featureless continua , have particularly strong jet components which happen to be oriented along our line of sight .",
    "therefore emission from the beamed jet dominates over disk / coronal emission from the central region of the agn .",
    "the remaining categories of agns , quasars , seyferts , radio galaxies and low luminosity agns ( llagns ) , may have jets which are not beamed toward us or may have no jets at all .",
    "quasars are very luminous , distant agn while llagns are much fainter and detected only nearby ; however according to unification these objects may differ only in their masses and accretion rates .",
    "optical observations are used to identify seyfert 1 s and broad line radio galaxies ( blrg s ) , which display broadened optical emission lines , versus seyfert 2 s and narrow line radio galaxies ( nlrg s ) , which display only narrow emission lines .",
    "a special subset of seyfert 1 s are the so - called narrow line seyfert 1 s ( nlsy1 s ) which display narrower broad emission lines than typical seyfert 1 s ( h@xmath1<2000 kms@xmath2 ) and are thought to be relatively small smbh s accreting very near the eddington limit with very steep ( i.e.  soft ) x - ray spectra ( see , e.g. , pounds et al.1995 ; grupe et al.1999 ) .",
    "one thing that nearly all agns have in common is a strong x - ray component ( elvis et al.1978 ) .",
    "it is believed that the x - ray power law continuum arises very near the central black hole , either from the accretion disk itself or a hot corona surrounding the black hole , or in some cases possibly from the base of a launching jet .",
    "in addition to the continuum , seyfert x - ray spectra can show a variety of components : emission lines ( most commonly from fe ) , absorption by gas which may be ionized ( `` warm '' ) or neutral ( `` cold '' ) , an excess below about 2 kev known as the `` soft excess , '' and compton reflection peaking around 2030 kev in the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "seyfert 2 s and nlrg s tend to have more absorption in the line of sight to the nucleus than seyfert 1 s ( antonucci et al.1993 ) , giving rise to the idea that we are seeing them `` edge on '' and that their broad line regions ( blr ) exist but are hidden from view by the compton - thick dusty torus which is seen in the infrared .",
    "this classical picture of seyfert 1/2 unification is still up for debate however , with evidence to suggest that while they may share a central engine , differences in the geometry of the circumnuclear material including the accretion disk , corona , broad line region , and compton - thick torus lead to the differences in observed characteristics that we see ( see , e.g. , ramos almeida et al.2011 ) .",
    "placing tighter constraints on the geometry of this material may help unravel this mystery of seyfert 1 s and 2 s .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) performed numerous observations of agns over its 16-year lifespan in the energy range from 3 kev to 200 kev .",
    "this energy range is ideal for quantifying the underlying continuum parameters as well as measuring the compton reflection hump ( crh ) , fe k@xmath3emission , and absorption by cold gas with column densities above @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "we have performed detailed analysis of all agns in the _ rxte_archive for which high - quality spectra could be obtained , totaling 100 objects in all . for many of these objects ,",
    "continuous long - term monitoring data provides long - term baselines for quantities such as the continuum photon index ( @xmath6 ) , the compton reflection strength ( @xmath7 ) and the column density of absorbing material in the line of sight ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "relating these components gives us a clearer picture of the geometry of the circumnuclear material in seyfert agns and allows us to test unification schemes .",
    "this paper is a follow - up to rivers et al.(2011 ; hereafter rmr2011 ) which analyzed 23 agn spectra with a particular focus on high quality data from 20100 kev , finding average values for the crh strength , fe line equivalent width ( @xmath9 ) , and photon index .",
    "this survey also found limited evidence for high energy rollovers below 100 kev ( caused by the thermal shape of the corona not being able to produce many very high energy photons ) with only two objects showing a significant rollover and ruling out the presence of a rollover in all but one of the other sources .",
    "we have quadrupled the sample size and include now all agns with high enough data quality to accurately measure @xmath6 , as well as the crh and fe k@xmath3line @xmath9 in most cases .",
    "the energy range for these spectra was from 3.5 kev up to at least 20 kev and as high as 200 kev for some objects .",
    "this sample will allow us to analyze the spectral components discussed above with an emphasis on bulk properties of different types of agn , providing a test of the unified model .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way : section 2 contains information on the _ rxte_archive and the data reduction process , section 3 details analysis methods , and section 4 contains a discussion of our findings .",
    "the _ rxte_satellite made x - ray observations from 1996 january to 2012 january with its two pointed observation instruments , the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al.2006 ) and the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; rothschild et al.1998 ) . in 16 years it observed 153 agns : 54 seyfert 1 s , 47 seyfert 2 s , and 52 blazars , many of them multiple times .",
    "note that we have included subtypes seyfert 1.2 and 1.5 in with the seyfert 1 s and seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 s in with the seyfert 2 s .",
    "the sampling of these objects has been highly inhomogeneous since different viewing schemes were proposed for each object at various times and for various scientific goals .",
    "we have included in our analysis all data for each object , regardless of sampling , in order to construct our overall averaged spectra .",
    "we wanted to construct energy spectra of as many of these agns as possible , however several of these object were observed only once or twice for a handful of kiloseconds .",
    "it was therefore important for us to find the necessary conditions required to construct useful spectra .",
    "we decided to include a source in our sample if fitting the pca data with a simple absorbed power law gave errors on the photon index of @xmath10 .",
    "we included hexte data if the source was detected by hexte at the 3@xmath11 level at 50 kev , otherwise only the pca data were used . for the pca we found that @xmath1240,000 total net counts was sufficient to give error bars of @xmath10 on @xmath6 . for hexte we found that @xmath125,500 counts were necessary to detect the source at the 3@xmath11 level at 50 kev , however the steepness of the spectrum was also a factor in general . for hexte , the whole energy range ( 20250 kev )",
    "was used whenever the data were included , though in many cases it did not help to constrain the model fitting past @xmath1250100 kev . there were two exceptions which had significant background features around 100 kev that affected fitting and so were only included to 8090 kev .    using these selection criteria we constructed time - averaged spectra for 100 agn .",
    "we identified these objects by their optical classifications per the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( `` ned '' ) , dividing our sample into 34 blazars and 66 seyferts , including 30 seyfert 1 s , 10 narrow line seyfert 1 s , and 26 seyfert 2 s , 7 of which were compton - thick ( defined as @xmath8@xmath13 ) .",
    "the names , redshifts , exposure times , and maximum energy included for each object in our sample are listed in table [ tabsample ] .",
    "those agn in the archive which did not yield usable spectra are summarized in appendix a.    ll@c@c@rrr|ll@c@rrr + source name & type & w.a . &",

    "an additional complication is the presence of excess soft emission ( below @xmath010 kev ) , usually modeled as a power law .",

    "additionally , dadina ( 2008 ) found correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and between @xmath83 and the @xmath9 of the neutral fe k@xmath3line , the  x - ray baldwin effect , \" neither of which could be confirmed in our data .",
    "again , the inclusion of several compton - thick sources could have an effect given the degeneracy in measuring @xmath6 and @xmath7 in these sources .",
    "patrick et al.(2012 ) analyzed a sample of 46 seyfert 1 s observed with _",
    "swift_-batand found that 39 out of their 46 seyfert 1 s showed a significant crh , exactly in line with our 85% of sources .",
    "however since they used a different compton reflection model we can not directly compare our @xmath7 values with their results , necessitating an alternative measurement of the strength of the crh , as detailed in the following section .",
    "they found an average @xmath6 for their sample of 1.82@xmath750.03 , in agreement with our value for seyfert 1 s of 1.86@xmath750.27 .",
    "their inclusion of seyfert 1.81.9 in their sample should not have an effect on this value since we find that there is no difference in the average value of @xmath6 between seyfert 11.5 s and compton thin seyfert 1.8 - 2 s .",
    "other surveys have been performed with more limited energy ranges and/or fewer objects . a survey of seyferts at high x - ray energies was done by ricci et al.(2011 ) using stacked _ integral_-isgri data in the 17250 kev range for different classes of seyferts to obtain bulk spectral properties .",
    "discrepancies between their results and ours may be due to their lack of coverage below 17 kev , making it difficult to quantify the underlying power law in sources with strong compton reflection , modeling of the crh ( assumptions about inclination angle can change measured @xmath7 values ) , and stacking itself , which as we have discussed above can lead to domination by just a few sources .",
    "they also fitted their spectra with models that included high energy rollovers in the 100300 kev range .",
    "when they modeled high energy rollovers their average @xmath6 and @xmath7 values for seyferts 1 s were 1.8 and 0.1 , for compton - thin seyfert 2 s 1.6 and 0.4 , for compton - thick seyfert 2 s 1.9 and 1.4 , and for nlsy1 s 2.3 and 4.2 , demonstrating the degeneracy between @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath34 .",
    "nandra & pounds ( 1994 ) analyzed _ ginga _ data of 27 seyferts in the 1.537 kev range and found average @xmath6 and @xmath7 values of 1.95 and 1.60 .",
    "gondek et al.(1996 ) produced stacked seyfert 1 spectra using combined _ cgro_-osse , _ ginga _ and _ exosat _ data ( taken at different times ) with average values for @xmath6 and @xmath7 of 1.90@xmath220.05 and 0.76@xmath220.15 . both these samples are consistent with our average values for the entire sample of 1.9 and 0.54 respectively .",
    "winter et al.(2009 ) found an average @xmath6 of 1.78 with a standard deviation of 0.24 for a sample of 102 _",
    "swift_-bat selected agn , however they did not model any compton reflection .",
    "our _ rxte_results are consistent with previous analyses and our sample has a number of advantages over previous surveys in the medium  hard x - ray bandpass .",
    "since the pca and hexte have always operated simultaneously , we do not have the ambiguity from source variability that comes from combining non - simultaneous soft and hard x - ray data sets from different missions as is commonly necessary to obtain broadband coverage .",
    "the broad bandpass is necessary to accurately constrain compton reflection and gain insight into the geometry and characteristics of the circumnuclear material .",
    "additionally , many of these sources were monitored over long periods of time and for these sources the spectral parameters can be taken as good longterm average baselines for time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "there are a number of factors that affect the shape and relative strength of the crh : the photon index of the incident power law , the inclination angle , the covering fraction of the material relative to the illuminating source , elemental abundances , and the geometry of the reflecting material .",
    "unfortunately , the changes in shape are very subtle and high energy spectrometers are not sensitive enough to these subtle differences to deconvolve all of these effects through spectral modeling .",
    "this has led to simplifications in the models and assumptions about the geometry of the reflecting material .",
    "common crh models in use typically assume either a flat disk or a uniform torus , but since both produce such similar spectral signatures , we must use other techniques to discern the geometry of the compton thick material .",
    "the pexravmodel has been widely used to model reflection off a disk of compton thick material such as the accretion disk .",
    "it assumes a plane of compton - thick material covering between 0 and @xmath122@xmath91 sterradians of the sky from the point of view of the illuminating source corresponding to @xmath7 between 0 and @xmath121 .",
    "however , a number of objects in our sample have reflection fractions greater than 1 , which is unphysical in this model , as is freezing the inclination angle to 30@xmath58 for all objects .",
    "it may seem tempting at this point to choose more accurate inclination angles on an object by object basis , however accurate estimates are very difficult to come by",
    ". it is sometimes assumed , based on seyfert 1/2 unification schemes , that seyfert 1 s will have smaller inclination angles ( i.e.  `` face on '' to the observer ) while seyfert 2 s will have larger angles ( i.e.  `` edge on '' to the observer ) , but this poses a number of problems .",
    "the first is that if we assume these objects have inherent differences we will inevitably find that we are correct . for example assuming seyfert 2 s are on average at an angle of @xmath92 will inflate the value of @xmath7 by a factor of 1.21.5 , leading to the possibly erroneous conclusion that there is more compton thick material surrounding seyfert 2 s .",
    "additionally , this does not take into account what effect a torus may have if present .",
    "we attempted to apply the torus model mytorus ( murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) to our data .",
    "this model is a simple donut shape of uniform density with an opening angle of 60@xmath58 .",
    "unfortunately , the model s assumption that the torus has a uniform density leads to a steep change in the line - of - sight absorption at the edge of the donut - shaped torus , causing all compton - thin sources to have fitted inclination angles close to 60@xmath58 .",
    "most sources also required additional fe line emission from compton - thin material , which meant that the fe line could not be used to constrain the amount of compton - thick material in these sources .",
    "for the majority of our sources this led to two parameters , angle and torus density , to characterize only one measurable quantity : the flux of the crh .",
    "we concluded that the best way to proceed was with the results of the pexravmodel , but to utilize it in a predominantly phenomenological way . since pexravis not the only crh model available , we also report the flux ratios in tables [ tabpar1 ]  [ tabpc ] , the relative flux of the crh to the underlying power law near the peak of the crh between 15 and 50 kev , which we can use to compare to results using other models , including ionized reflectors , such as reflionx , or torus models such as mytorus .",
    "we calculated this flux ratio ( @xmath21 ) by finding the 1550 kev flux for the power law continuum and for the crh , then defining @xmath93 .",
    "there is a linear proportionality between @xmath21 and @xmath7 for fixed values of cos@xmath57 and @xmath6 . at 30@xmath58 with @xmath94 , we find that @xmath95 .",
    "patrick et al.(2012 ) reported @xmath21 values for their 46 seyfert 1 s modeled with reflionx . comparing their distribution of reflection fractions ( their figure 12 ) with ours , shown in figure [ frdist ] , we see a very similar smooth distribution with the majority of objects falling below @xmath7=1 ( @xmath21=0.8 ) but with a long tail towards higher values .    using the kolmogorov - smirnov test to compare our distributions of @xmath7 for seyfert 1 s versus seyfert 2 s we find a p value of 0.999 ( p=0.982 comparing distributions of @xmath21 ) , where we have ignored the outliers ngc  6240",
    ", circinus and ngc  4945 , and included only well - determined @xmath7 values ( i.e. , with @xmath96 and upper limits @xmath970.5 ) . here",
    ", @xmath98 denotes the likelihood that the two distributions of values of @xmath7 ( or @xmath21 ) can arise from the same parent population and thus confirms that the distributions are statistically similar between both classes of objects these distributions are likely not consistent with the simple disk geometry and the standard seyfert 1/2 unification since we would expect to see more compton reflection in face - on seyfert 1 s than in side - view seyfert 2 s , which we do not observe . the similarity in reflection fractions in our",
    "seyfert 1 s and 2 s is consistent with reflection off the inner wall of a torus , where viewing angle does not change the amount of observed reflection significantly .",
    "we tested this empirically using the mytorus and pexravmodels and found a factor of @xmath9910% difference in @xmath21 going from 0viewing angle to 60for the torus , in contrast to a factor of @xmath1240% difference over the same angle change for a disk . at viewing angles greater than @xmath1260obscuration from the torus",
    "becomes a factor .",
    "another way to probe the circumnuclear material is to compare the strength of the fe line with the strength of the compton hump .",
    "george & fabian ( 1991 ) calculated the expected flux of the fe line produced by reflection off a compton - thick disk with respect to the flux of the compton hump ; it s expected that the fe line ew will be @xmath12150 ev for @xmath1001 at an angle of 30 @xmath58 . in figure [ rvsew ] we show the strength of the crh plotted versus the ew of the fe line for all seyferts . from our analysis , compton - thick reflection accounts for @xmath1240% of the fe line flux on average , however the variation is quite large .",
    "the remainder of the fe line flux may arise in compton - thin neutral gas in the nlr or in the blr clouds ( although there is a limit to how much fe line flux compton - thin gas can produce ; see de rosa et al.2012 ) and/or be from ionized compton - thin gas in the vicinity of the nucleus . with the limited resolution of the pca around 67 kev we can not disentangle these possible origins .",
    "approximately three quarters of seyfert 1 s and compton - thin 2 s show more fe line flux from sources other than from compton reflection , assuming a disk geometry . note that compton - reflection from a torus may have a slightly different expected ratio of the fe line to the crh flux , depending on the particular geometry assumed .",
    "most of the blazars in our sample were well fit by a simple power law .",
    "four bl  lac type objects were fit better by a broken power law with break energies below @xmath1210 kev and steepening by @xmath120.2 ( note that this small a change in @xmath6 is due to a very gradual rollover of the spectrum which we are only sensitive to in our brightest sources ) .",
    "the average @xmath6 for our sample was 2.1 with a variance of 0.15 .",
    "the average @xmath6 for flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq s ) was 1.8 while the average for bl  lac objects was 2.3 with variances of 0.2 and 0.1 respectively .",
    "the distribution of @xmath6 for the blazar sub - types is shown in figure [ gdistbl ] .",
    "in addition to the lower photon index , the fsrq s also tend to be much more luminous than the bl  lac s .",
    "figure [ lgblaz ] shows the x - ray 210 kev luminosity versus the photon index for our sample of blazars .",
    "we found a weak anti - correlation between these quantities with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.40 , significant at the 99% level .",
    "this is consistent with the `` fossati sequence '' ( fossati et al.1998 ) which predicts that for higher luminosities the peak of the broadband emission humps would shift to lower energies . at lower luminosities the upper end of the synchrotron hump dominates the x - ray band while at higher luminosities the lower end of the inverse compton hump dominates",
    "the means a softening of the x - ray portion of the sed and an increase in the photon index as luminosity decreases .",
    "donato et al.(2001 ) published a large x - ray sample of blazars observed by _",
    "bepposax_which also confirmed this trend .",
    "dai & zhang ( 2003 ) analyzed _ exosat _ , _ asca _ and _ bepposax_data to obtain hard x - ray photon indices for 20 sources .",
    "they reported average @xmath6 of 2.78@xmath280.25 for high - frequency - peaked bl  lac objects ( hbls ) , 1.85@xmath280.35 for low - frequency - peaked bl  lac objects ( lbls ) , and 1.64@xmath280.28 for fsrqs .",
    "fan et al.2012 focused on fermi - selected blazars , finding average values of @xmath6 in the x - ray band of 2.39@xmath280.35 for hbls , 1.97@xmath280.38 for lbls , and 1.89@xmath280.37 for fsrqs . noting that the majority of our bl  lac objects are high - frequency or intermediate - frequency peaked , these measurements are all in good agreement with ours .",
    "we have analyzed data for 100 agn in the _ rxte_archive in order to explore the geometry of circumnuclear material around smbh s and characterize their x - ray spectra .",
    "we present a large sample of x - ray bright agn which has a number of advantages over previous surveys in the medium  hard x - ray bandpass : the simultaneity of the @xmath9710 kev and @xmath1610 kev x - ray data eliminates ambiguity , the relatively broad bandpass is necessary to accurately measure the continuum power law and the crh in order to gain insight into the geometry and characteristics of the circumnuclear material , and the long monitoring campaigns make this sample ideal for using as a baseline average for future time - resolved spectral analysis . to that end",
    ", we have presented the spectral parameters of our sample including absorption , fe line equivalent widths , compton reflection strengths , photon indices , and 210 kev fluxes in tables [ tabpar1][tabbp ] along with average values by type in table [ tabavg ] .",
    "the similar distributions of @xmath6 for type 1 and 2 seyferts supports the idea that they share a common central engine .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 showed no difference in the reflection from compton - thick material in seyfert 1 s and 2 s .",
    "this is counter to what we would expect from reflection off a disk under classical unification schemes where face - on seyfert 1 s would be expected to show significantly more reflection than edge - on seyfert 2 s .",
    "the similar distributions are more consistent with reflection off a torus .",
    "we did not find a significant correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath83 for the seyferts in our sample , however nlsy1 s showed significantly higher photon indices .",
    "this is consistent with a common central engine for all seyferts with the primary differences between types being dependent on accretion rate and the geometry of the circumnuclear material .",
    "additionally , a few of the seyfert 2 s in our sample had very soft x - ray spectra , similar to nlsy1 s , and could be type 2 analogs of nlsy1 s , as expected under unification .",
    "we found that roughly 85% of seyferts showed significant contribution from the crh . comparing the strength of the crh with the amount of the fe emission seen allowed us to estimate the ratio of compton - thick to compton - thin material in agn with the average being around 40% , however with large object to object variation .",
    "we found a negative correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath83 for blazars in agreement with the fossati sequence and the luminosity dependance of the broad band sed hump peak energies .",
    "we confirm that it is likely agn do share a common engine across the various types , concluding that the differences in their observed properties are likely based on mass , accretion rate , and geometry of the circumnuclear material .",
    "the ratio of compton - thick to compton - thin material was not consistent from object to object and did not seem to be dependent on optical classification .",
    "while seyfert 2 s were more likely to have high absorption columns , they were as likely to show strong compton reflection humps as seyfert 1 s , inconsistent with reflection off a disk , assuming type depends on inclination angle . a more complex reflecting geometry such as a torus , combined disk and torus , or clumpy torus is likely a more accurate picture of the compton - thick material .",
    "as a resource for future analyses of agn , we plan to make spectra and light curves available online .",
    "these spectra may serve as baselines for future missions such as _ nustar _ , which which will look at a large number of agn in the 680 kev band with excellent sensitivity and spectral resolution .",
    "they could potentially be combined with multi - wavelength data to create sed s for future analysis or with information about abundances of the different types to create the agn contribution to the cxb .",

    "circinus is a bright , well - studied , reflection - dominated source with a very strong crh , a compton - thick absorber , and a soft power law component , the origin of which is a combination of ionized plasma commensurate with the nlr and contamination from nearby point sources ( matt et al.1999 ; sambruna et al.2001 ) .",

    "it was possible to fit this source with with a power law continuum plus a crh ( table [ tabpar2 ] ) or with a compton - thick absorber with leaked emission and a crh ( table [ tabpc ] ) .",
    "matt et al.(1997 ) and colbert et al.(2002 ) modeled the spectrum below 10 kev with an ionized reflector plus a neutral reflector , however because the source is so faint we can not distinguish between this and a power law . since we are unable to place constraints on the compton - thick absorber in this source due to the extremely high column density and lack of good data above @xmath030 kev , we adopt the parameters from the base model given in table [ tabpar2 ] for this source .",
    "ngc4945 was best fit by a hard x - ray power law with a compton - thick absorber and an additional power law visible below about 10 kev due to nuclear starburst activity ( see , e.g. , schurch et al.2002 and references therein ) .",

    "ngc6300 has been reported to have very interesting spectral behavior , changing from a reflection dominated to a regular compton - thin seyfert 2 ( leighly et al.1999 ; guainazzi 2002 ) , while a variability study by awaki et al.(2005 ) has indicated that it may be a seyfert 1 core obscured by heavy absorption .",
    "however , the faintness of the source means that it has been difficult to properly constrain these models in order to test these ideas . with only 27 ks of data and a flux of @xmath141 erg@xmath5s@xmath2 , we are not able to constrain these models very well either .",
    "fitting the data with a reflection - only model yields @xmath25/dof@xmath142 , and @xmath143 , while a partial - covering compton - thick absorber model with no reflection yields @xmath8@xmath144 @xmath5 and @xmath25/dof@xmath145 .",

    "note that if _ rxte_caught the source sometimes compton - thick and sometimes compton - thin ( piconcelli et al.2007 , bianchi et al.2009 ) , then a partial covering absorber model would provide a good fit of the time - averaged data and would make it difficult to measure accurately the actual quantity of reflected emission .",
    "for almost all of the blazars in our sample a simple or broken power law gave a good description of the spectrum , however 3c273 is something of a special case with an fe line and compton hump having been detected previously in this source ( e.g. , grandi et al .",

    "the blazars 1es 1218 + 304 and mkn  766 are located 0.73 degrees from each other .",
