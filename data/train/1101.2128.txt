    "since yangian algebra was presented by drinfeld in 1985 , it has attracted much attention . not only can yangian algebra describe the symmetry of quantum integrable models , but also can present the transitions of the states between different weights beyond the lie algebra . for a bi - spin system",

    "this important link between the two subspaces and yangian algebra is suitable for any bi - spin systems , not only the xy model .",
    "the effect of yangian operators will contribute to the boost of the high fidelity .    to illustrate the effect of yangian algebra on the fidelity , we discuss it as follows . by the transition characteristic of the yangian algebra ,",
    "first let us act the transition operators @xmath105 on the initial state @xmath69 , the corresponding final states are given by    @xmath106    with the normalization condition .",

    "6 and 7 . by comparing figs . 6 and 7 with fig .",
    "3 , one can find that by making use of the operator @xmath108 , the high fidelity transits from @xmath81 to @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and vanishes when @xmath111 ; accordingly , it only was centered on @xmath112 and @xmath111 by taking advantage of @xmath113 in ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) space . by comparing the effect before and after the transition of yangian algebra from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 6 , we can clearly find that the high fidelities are complemented in addition to the partial regular extinction .",
    "it is the similar case by comparing figs .",
    "3(b ) and 7 .",
    "high fidelity transits from the third and the fourth quadrants to the second quadrant by the operator @xmath108 and to the first quadrant by @xmath113 in ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) space . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the ground state is @xmath69 , and there is not degeneracy in the case of @xmath82 .",
    "the initial state is orthogonal to the final states @xmath114 and @xmath115 , namely , the overlap between two final states and the ground state passes out .",
    "hence @xmath116 , and there is not a long tail as shown in fig .",
    "6 . however , the degeneracy of the ground states will appear for @xmath74 , namely , the ground state is made up of @xmath69 and @xmath76 .",
    "the overlap between two final states and the ground state is not zero .",
    "so one can see a long tail around @xmath82 in fig .",
    "7 . whatever , the high fidelities are concentrated more on the one quadrant of a plan and are almost sudden death in the others through the transition effect of yangian generators in the tensor product space .",
    "these results show that yangian has the better hand , as a switch , to turn on or off the fidelity . to the better properties ,",
    "possible applications are expected .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the properties of the energy level crossings of the ground states in the two subspaces and the evolution of the thermal fidelity in the two - qubit system with a transverse non - homogeneous magnetic field respectively .",
    "we also discussed the effects of the quantum algebra on the states and high fidelity in the isotropy subspace and anisotropy subspace .",
    "for important parameters , we plotted the contour figures of energy gap , with the help of which the ground state can be distinguished and the level crossings are easily recognized . the thermal fidelity is completely calculated in both the xy model ( @xmath71 ) and ising model ( @xmath74 ) . in the two models the evolution tendencies of thermal fidelity versus the temperature are uniform when @xmath117 ; but when @xmath51 at @xmath118 , the value of the @xmath83 in xy model is two times than one in ising model , because the energy level crossing appears . at @xmath75",
    "the contours of fidelity versus the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 show @xmath83 rapid death around @xmath51 besides minimal region like @xmath119 function . therefore the anisotropic factor of the magnetic field @xmath6 , one of the focus in this paper , can be modulated to control the thermal fidelity .",
    "in addition , the thermal fidelity figures between the two final states and the state of the system at temperature @xmath0 are obtained by the transition effect of yangian generators , and show that the high fidelity only appears in the one branch ( @xmath112 ) of the equilateral hyperbola in the ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) plane . moreover ,",
    "yangian algebra plays important roles in enhancing the high @xmath83 and making it more concentrate on the one quarter plane .",
    "so to speak , we present a more optimal proposal to turn on or off the fidelity as a switch .",
