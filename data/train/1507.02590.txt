    "due to their high temperature , many plasmas , such as the ones encountered in the core of tokamaks or in the magnetosphere , can be considered as collisionless .",
    "consequently , they may be well described by kinetic equations such as the vlasov - maxwell system where the particle dynamics is described by a distribution function @xmath1 defined on a six - dimensional phase space @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the position and @xmath4 the velocity .",
    "it is particularly challenging to solve such kinetic models , even using advanced numerical techniques .",
    "in addition , a full kinetic description of the system might provide unnecessary information , depending on the phenomena under investigation .",
    "this is the justification , e.g. , for gyrokinetic theories where a strong magnetic field assumption@xcite leads to the perpendicular component of the velocity being replaced by the magnetic moment considered as an adiabatic invariant .",
    "similarly , anisotropy due to a strong magnetic field is also used to reduce the complexity of the original kinetic problem in the double adiabatic theory@xcite .",
    "more generally , and ideally , reduced models obtained by some kind of closure leads to a decrease in the complexity of the original kinetic problem , while maintaining accuracy and providing physical insights about the processes at work . consequently , fluid reductions of kinetic equations are often sought .    generally speaking ,",
    "fluid models are obtained by projecting the distribution function as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-th fluid moment defined as the @xmath7-th moment of the distribution function with respect to the velocity @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath8 for all @xmath9 and @xmath10 is some specific fixed set of basis functions .",
    "the dynamics of the distribution function @xmath1 is then given by the dynamics of the fluid moments that are functions of the configuration space coordinate @xmath3 only .",
    "this makes fluid models , which involve quantities such as , the density @xmath11 , the fluid velocity @xmath12 and the pressure @xmath13 , convenient to interpret .",
    "furthermore , since fluid variables only depend on @xmath3 at each time , they are substantially less expensive to solve numerically than their kinetic counterpart .",
    "clearly accurate reduced fluid models are desirable , but finding effective fluid closures is a difficult and largely open problem . indeed , despite their strong physical relevance , a general or optimal procedure for obtaining them for the vlasov equation does not exist .",
    "for example , consider the following simple free advection equation : @xmath14 which is the vlasov equation with field dynamics removed . multiplying eq .   by @xmath15 and integrating with respect to the velocity , yields the following infinite hierarchy of moment equations :",
    "@xmath16 for all @xmath9 . in order to be able to solve eqs .",
    ", one has to truncate the infinite set of equations at some order @xmath17 .",
    "however , because the time evolution of @xmath18 involves @xmath19 , the latter must be neglected or expressed in terms of lower order moments , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "this is the ubiquitous closure problem for fluid reductions of kinetic equations .    in conventional fluid closure theory a collision process and",
    "assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is basic . instead ,",
    "in this article we consider hamiltonian fluid reductions , where we investigate closures based on whether or not they preserve hamiltonian structure .",
    "this allows us to select out a subset of all possible fluid closures that preserve the geometrical structure and this prevents the introduction of non - physical dissipation in the resulting fluid moment system , without requiring nearness to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the case of two moments@xcite corresponds to the well - known exact water - bag reduction , so it is not surprising that it is hamiltonian .",
    "however , as one increases the number of moments , this increases the dimension of the subset @xmath21 , and the constraints needed to preserve the hamiltonian structure become more difficult to solve@xcite , so that eventually , it is not possible to obtain a general analytic expression for the closure @xmath20 .    the problem of deriving hamiltonian fluid models can , however , be tackled from different angles .",
    "indeed , instead of eq .",
    ", other representations of the distribution function can be used to decrease the complexity of the initial problem . in this paper",
    "we consider a general water - bag model@xcite , which has also been used , e.g. , in gyrokinetics@xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "this projection is obtained by replacing the distribution function with a piecewise constant function in the velocity @xmath22 such that @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are constants , @xmath25 denotes the heavyside distribution and @xmath26 is a set of contour velocities . like with the fluid moment projection ,",
    "the dynamics of the distribution function @xmath27 defined on phase space has been replaced by the dynamics of @xmath28 fields defined on configuration space , namely @xmath26 for all @xmath29 .",
    "the use of the water - bag projection constitutes an exact reduction and consequently the resulting system is intrinsically hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "when the number of field variables expressed in terms of fluid moments and the number of contour velocities are the same , the water - bag projection is easier to handle than that of the usual fluid moments representation ; in particular , this is the case for the computation of a poisson bracket .",
    "however , even though the contour velocities @xmath30 are rather convenient to handle from a computational point of view , their macroscopic physical interpretation is less obvious than for the fluid moments .",
    "consequently , there is a balance to seek between the computational simplicity of the closure provided by the water - bag model and the physical relevance of the fluid moments .    in this article",
    ", we investigate links between the water - bag and the fluid moment representations in order to generate new hamiltonian closures .",
    "indeed , any truncation of the infinite series given by eq .   is preserved by the dynamics and hence constitutes a closure . as a consequence ,",
    "the subset of all the water - bag distribution functions is invariant .",
    "following the water - bag projection , we perform a fluid reduction of the distribution function to obtain a hamiltonian fluid model . then , we construct a systematic procedure to obtain a fluid reduction from the water - bag distribution function by preserving the hamiltonian structure of the parent kinetic model .",
