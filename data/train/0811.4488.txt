    "the general solution of ( [ sl1 ] ) has the form of a power series with respect to the spectral parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that under certain conditions @xmath4 is a complex analytic function of @xmath7 has long been known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the representation from @xcite gives a simple procedure for constructing its taylor coefficients .",
    "our main purpose here is to show that this representation gives us , among other possible applications , a simple and powerful method for numerical solution of initial value , boundary value and spectral problems .",
    "we will generalize slightly by considering the equation @xmath8 and representing its general solution in terms of a solution of ( [ sl0 ] ) , which does not depend on the coefficient @xmath9 .    in section [ sectsl ]",

    "this fact and the simple form of the solutions make the spps method appropriate for solving initial and boundary value problems .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the representation of a solution of the sturm - liouville equation in the form of an spps is well - suited for solving spectral problems as it reduces problem to calculation of zeros of an analytic function defined by its taylor series . in section [ sectsp ] we show that even difficult examples like the coffey - evans potential can be handled by the spps method ; there is little doubt that the numerical performance of the method can be significantly improved using additional computational techniques discussed in the paper . in section [ sectspdbc ]",
    "we show that the appearance of the spectral parameter in the boundary conditions does not provoke additional difficulties in application of the spps method . as an example of application of the spps method to singular sturm - liouville problems we consider in section [ sectsingproblems ] a very interesting example of a highly non - self - adjoint operator ( with complex and singular coefficients ) discussed in a number of recent publications @xcite .",
    "the spps method makes it possible to obtain eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the problem even when other known algorithms encounter numerical difficulties .",
