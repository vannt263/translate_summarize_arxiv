    "for many decades now , there has been a sustained interest in the physics of one - dimensional quantum systems , in no small part due to bethe s fundamental paper on the heisenberg spin chain @xcite .",
    "this publication laid the foundation for what has today become one of the most important fields of mathematical physics , namely the theory of bethe ansatz integrable models .",
    "more recently , renewed motivation for the study of interacting quantum models in 1d has come from their growing number of experimental realizations .",
    "the simplest system to consider is probably the one - dimensional gas of bosons with local ( delta function ) interaction ( known as the lieb - liniger model @xcite ) , which can effectively describe atoms confined using optical lattices @xcite . a wide range of interactions",
    "are accessible , even the strongly - interacting ( free fermion - like ) limit considered long ago by tonks and girardeau @xcite .",
    "the integrability of the lieb - liniger model is by now textbook material @xcite , and many of the standard methods now used in the field were in fact first developed and applied to it .",
    "for example , after the construction of the ground state and elementary excitations in @xcite , the yang - yang approach to thermodynamics was introduced in @xcite , leading the way to nonperturbative results on the equilibrium properties of the infinite system at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to help further our understanding of the interacting bose gas in one dimension , by addressing one of the long - standing unresolved problems associated to it : the calculation of correlation functions .",
    "the importance of this is clear , in view of the fact that most experimentally - accessible response functions are expressible in terms of a few basic dynamical correlation functions of local physical fields .    because of the relative complexity of the bethe ansatz eigenfunctions , it has proved much more difficult to provide information on correlation functions than on thermodynamics . for the interacting bose gas ,",
    "the first set of results probably dates back to the work of girardeau @xcite , who considered the strongly - interacting limit .",
    "this represents a major simplification in that the spectrum becomes that of free fermions .",
    "the bosonic density operator then coincides with a free fermionic one , in view of its blindness to particle statistics .",
    "handling particle statistics in the same limit allows to obtain the one - body density matrix as the determinant of a fredholm integral operator , both at zero and nonzero temperatures @xcite .",
    "away from the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit , static local moments of the density operator can be obtained .",
    "the second moment @xmath0 is given directly from the derivative of the partition function with respect to the interaction parameter ( the hellmann - feynman theorem ) @xcite , but higher moments @xmath1 with @xmath2 are more challenging .",
    "these were computed for arbitrary temperature in a large coupling expansion in @xcite .",
    "at zero temperature , the third moment @xmath3 was obtained exactly for any interaction in @xcite using an integrable lattice regularization of the lieb - liniger model coupled with conformal field theory @xcite considerations .",
    "the full calculation of correlation functions beyond either the static of local cases remains analytically intractable to this day . besides formulations for the asymptotics based on conformal field theory ,",
    "there exist important results providing determinant representations of the exact correlators in terms of auxiliary quantum fields , which ultimately map the infinite - volume problem to the calculation of the determinant of a fredholm operator obeying a completely integrable integro - differential equation @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics of the correlation functions can then be obtained by solving a riemann - hilbert problem ( see @xcite and references therein for an introduction to the subject ) .",
    "closed - form analytical expressions for general correlation functions have however not yet been obtained .    here , we make use of another strategy which one of us originally developed for dynamical spin - spin correlation functions in heisenberg spin chains @xcite .",
    "our objective is not to give final answers to the theoretical computation of correlation functions , but rather to provide a reliable and practical computational scheme for obtaining them to very high precision .",
    "this will be of great help for experimental comparisons ( where finite resolutions are inevitable ) or comparison with other theoretical methods .",
    "we specialize here to one - body correlations , following on our earlier work @xcite on dynamical density - density correlations .",
    "the overall strategy is summarized as follows : two - point correlation functions are expressed as an appropriate sum of form factors over intermediate states , and the summation is carried out numerically .",
    "the form factors of local operators are expressed as determinants of matrices whose entries are simple functions of the sets of bethe rapidities of the two eigenstates involved ( for the density , they were obtained in @xcite ; see however the more practical representaion we offer here for the field form factor ) .",
    "the summation over intermediate states can itself be aggressively optimized by making use of the fact that not all intermediate states contribute equally to the desired correlator .",
    "such an optimized method is in principle applicable to any integrable model as long as the determinant representations of the form factors are known , and was baptized the abacus method @xcite .",
    "we here carry on with our study of the lieb - liniger model by providing the corresponding computations for its one - particle dynamical correlation function .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first review the basic formulation of the theory , and define the correlations we will be interested in .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz for the model is thereafter presented , and used to derive a simplified representation for the one - particle form factor in terms of the determinant of a single matrix .",
    "we then present the results for the correlation functions for a range of values of the interaction parameter , and discuss the results in detail , in particular their specialization to the static case ( momentum distribution function and one - body density matrix ) .",
    "conclusions and directions for future work are presented at the end .",
    "we consider a ring of length @xmath4 , with @xmath5 bosonic particles interacting repulsively with each other through a local potential of strength @xmath6 .",
    "the time evolution of this system is controlled by the lieb - liniger hamiltonian @xcite @xmath7 an alternate second - quantized formulation is obtained by introducing canonical bose fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 with equal - time commutation relations @xmath10 = \\delta ( x - y ) , \\hspace{0.5 cm } \\left[\\psi(x ) , \\psi(y ) \\right ] = \\left[\\psi^{\\dagger}(x ) , \\psi^{\\dagger}(y ) \\right ] = 0.\\ ] ] the fock vacuum @xmath11 is then defined by @xmath12 and thus the model corresponds to the quantum nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath13.\\ ] ] the bethe ansatz provides a basis for the fock space .",
    "more precisely , in the repulsive case @xmath14 which we are considering , each eigenfunction in the @xmath5-particle sector is fully described by a set of @xmath5 real parameters @xmath15 , solution to a set of coupled nonlinear equations ( the bethe equations , which we will review and discuss in more details in the next section ) .",
    "our aim here is to present computations of the zero temperature one - particle dynamical correlation function @xmath16 as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath6 ( we consider here only the repulsive case @xmath14 ) . by identifying the state @xmath17 with the ground state and using the closure relation of bethe eigenstates",
    ", this correlation function can be represented as a sum over form factors of the local field operator between ground- and excited state as @xmath18 the evaluation of this expression can be performed in three steps : first , finding the solution of the bethe equations ; second , computing the form factors ; finally , performing the summation over intermediate states .",
    "we begin by providing a new representation for the form factors , using the algebraic bethe ansatz , which allows all these steps to be efficiently implemented numerically for finite numbers of particles .",
    "the central object of the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite ( or quantum inverse scattering method ; for an introduction to the concepts and terminology , see @xcite ) is the @xmath19-matrix , which solves the yang - baxter equation and takes the following form for the lieb - liniger model ( quantum nonlinear schrdinger equation ) : @xmath20 in which @xmath21 other standard functions which we will use later are defined as @xmath22 the monodromy matrix , which will be used to construct all the conserved charges ( in particular , the hamiltonian ) is represented in auxiliary space as @xmath23 where the @xmath24 operators act in the fock space as follows .",
    "the vacuum is an eigenvector of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , whereas @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively act as raising and lowering operators with the annihilation properties @xmath32 the commutation relations between these operators are quadratic , and given by @xmath33 the hamiltonian is related by trace identities to the trace of the monodromy matrix , @xmath34 , and these can therefore be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are constructed as @xmath35 provided that the rapidities are solution to the bethe equations @xmath36 or in logarithmic form , @xmath37 where the quantum numbers @xmath38 are half - odd integers for @xmath5 even , and integers for @xmath5 odd .",
    "proper eigenfunctions are obtained for sets of non - coincident rapidities @xmath39 .",
    "since the left - hand side of ( [ logbethe ] ) is a monotonous function of @xmath40 , it can be proven that all solutions are real @xcite ; we can moreover span the whole fock space by choosing sets of ordered quantum numbers @xmath41 meaning that @xmath42 .",
    "once the bethe equations are solved for the rapidities , the eigenstate is fully characterized .",
    "the state norm is obtained from the gaudin - korepin formula @xcite , which can be proven by making use of the commutation relations between @xmath30 and @xmath31 operators : @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is the gaudin matrix , whose entries are simple analytical functions of the rapidities , @xmath45 - k ( \\lambda_j , \\lambda_k ) \\label{gaudin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kernel is @xmath46 the energy and momentum of an eigenstate are also given by simple functions of the rapidities , namely @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a chemical potential used to set the filling in a grand - canonical ensemble .    for our purposes",
    ", we also need explicit expressions for the form factors of the field operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 between bethe eigenstates . by making use of the fact that the energy and momentum are diagonal operators in this basis",
    ", we can explicitly take the space and time dependence into account and write @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the conjugate . in these notations ,",
    "the correlation function ( [ g2 ] ) becomes @xmath54 in which @xmath55    the explicit evaluation of the summation in ( [ g2sum ] ) to obtain a closed - form expression for the correlation function remains an open problem in the theory of integrable models .",
    "we will here however make use of the building blocks which were developed in this spirit .",
    "namely , in @xcite , the following useful expression was obtained for the field operator form factor : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 although equation ( [ formfactor_old ] ) offers an exact representation of the form factors for fixed @xmath5 , ( [ mi_old ] ) is not convenient for numerical purposes .",
    "we therefore here first rewrite the form factors in terms of a single matrix determinant without derivative , which is much more economically evaluated numerically .",
    "the trick is simple , and consists in getting rid of the auxiliary parameter @xmath59 in ( [ mi_old ] ) by using the fact that , given two matrices @xmath25 and @xmath30 of which @xmath30 has rank @xmath60 , the following identity holds : @xmath61 therefore , @xmath62 consider now the @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath63 matrix @xmath65 with entries @xmath66 since the lines of this matrix are proportional to @xmath67 , the determinant of this matrix is easily computed : @xmath68 consider now rewriting ( [ mi_one ] ) as @xmath69 the matrix product above can be calculated explicitly .",
    "consider the sum @xmath70 and the auxiliary contour integral @xmath71 the integration contour is a big circle of radius @xmath19 containing all poles of the integrand .",
    "the value of this integral is then given by the residue at infinity , which equals zero since the integrand behaves like @xmath72 at @xmath73 .",
    "on the other hand , the sum of the residues at points @xmath74 , @xmath75 inside the contour gives exactly @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , there is a pole at @xmath77 and , for @xmath78 , we also have a pole at @xmath79 .",
    "since the sum over all of these residues is zero , we obtain @xmath80 similarly , we have the identity @xmath81 this whole procedure allows us to rewrite the matrix product @xmath82 , finally leading to @xmath83 in which the matrix @xmath84 s entries are functions of the rapidities of the left and right eigenstates , @xmath85 in which @xmath86 for the repulsive bose gas which we are considering , the @xmath84 matrix has purely real entries .",
    "the matrix elements also conveniently coincide with those obtained in @xcite for the ( integral of the ) local density operator , and which we used in @xcite to compute density correlation functions .",
    "from the results of the previous section , we can therefore rewrite the one - body dynamical correlation function ( [ g2 ] ) as @xmath87 in which the correlation weight for a given intermediate state is explicitly given by the following function of its rapidities @xmath88 and of the set of ground state rapidities @xmath15 : @xmath89 ^ 2}{||\\ { \\lambda \\}_n ||^2 ||\\{\\mu \\}_{n-1}||^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath84 matrix entries are given by equation ( [ u ] ) , and the state norms are given by ( [ norm ] ) and ( [ gaudin ] ) .    in the present context , it is more convenient to consider the space and time fourier transform of the correlation function , @xmath90 which explicitly displays that each intermediate bethe eigenstate contributes all its correlation weight @xmath91 at a single point in the @xmath92 , @xmath93 plane .",
    "a particular intermediate state can be composed of a number of single - particle excitations . due to the fermion - like structure of the ground state ,",
    "these take two different basic forms , namely ( following the terminology of @xcite ) type i ( particle ) and type ii ( hole ) .",
    "particle - like excitations are obtained by adding an extra occupied quantum number outside the ground state interval , while the hole - like excitations are obtained by removing one of the occupied ground state quantum numbers .",
    "type i modes are bogoliubov - like particles existing at any momentum , and whose dispersion relation ( in the infinite system ) interpolates between @xmath94 at the noninteracting @xmath95 point to @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the density ) as @xmath98 .",
    "type ii particles do not appear in bogoliubov theory .",
    "their dispersion relation coincides with the lower threshold of the correlation function , and vanishes at @xmath99 , with the fermi momentum given by @xmath100 .",
    "both types of excitations have a dispersion relation which approaches @xmath101 with a slope equal to the velocity of sound @xmath102 .",
    "the action of the field operator on a bethe eigenstate is found to be relatively innocuous , in the sense that the size distribution of its matrix elements in this basis is very strongly peaked .",
    "there are in other words only relatively few form factors of large value , and all of these involve only up to a handful of elementary excitations .",
    "the trace over the fock space of intermediate states can thus be performed in a highly optimized way by searching for and concentrating the computational effort on these important intermediate states ( part of the idea of the abacus method ) .",
    "this is implemented with a recursive search algorithm .    in order to verify the accuracy of our results ,",
    "we make use of the observation that integrating the one - body correlation function ( [ g2komega ] ) over frequency and summing over momenta simply yields back the density of the gas , @xmath103 which provides a convenient sumrule for our method . physically ,",
    "for large enough @xmath5 and @xmath4 , there is only one important physical parameter , which is defined as @xmath104 .",
    "all the results presented here are obtained by setting the density to one , and varying the interaction parameter @xmath6 .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in the case of finite coupling constant , only the asymptotic expansion for small and large momenta are known .",
    "the infrared behavior can be obtained from the hydrodynamic theory of low - energy excitations @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the speed of sound .",
    "the above result holds for @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the healing length .",
    "the corresponding behavior of the one - body density matrix is @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "the exponent @xmath59 interpolates between @xmath112 and @xmath113 when the coupling constant @xmath114 is increased from @xmath112 to @xmath115 .",
    "the large momentum tail can be elegantly obtained by using simple theorems on the fourier transform @xcite and can be related to the previously calculated second moment of the density operator @xcite , yielding ( @xmath116 corresponds to @xmath117 in ref .",
    "@xcite and not to @xmath118 ) @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the ground - state energy per particle in the thermodynamic limit ( in the tg limit this formula was previously obtained in ref .",
    "similarly a small @xmath121 expansion can be written for the one - body density matrix : @xmath122 the @xmath123 law for @xmath116 implies that the lowest odd power in this taylor expansion is @xmath124 , thus @xmath125 .",

    "now this interesting regime has been investigated only with purely numerical methods as quantum monte carlo @xcite and density matrix renormalization group @xcite . however , these methods , although very powerful , were unable to describe all the physics from the infrared to the ultraviolet .",

    "in conclusion , we have presented results for the one - body dynamical correlation function of the one - dimensional bose gas ( lieb - liniger model ) by using the abacus method , mixing integrability and numerics .",

    "<S> the momentum- and frequency - dependent one - body correlation function of the one - dimensional interacting bose gas ( lieb - liniger model ) in the repulsive regime is studied using the algebraic bethe ansatz and numerics . </S>",
    "<S> we first provide a determinant representation for the field form factor which is well - adapted to numerical evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function is then reconstructed to high accuracy for systems with finite but large numbers of particles , for a wide range of values of the interaction parameter . </S>",
    "<S> our results are extensively discussed , in particular their specialization to the static case . </S>"
