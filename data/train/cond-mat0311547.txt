    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is a valuable tool to study the experimental band - structure(bs ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is energy and @xmath5 is momentum of electrons in a solid .",
    "recent ultra - violet - arpes ( arups ) studies of correlated materials have provided important results like spin and charge collective modes in a quasi 1-d ( dimensional ) metal  @xcite , dimensional crossover  @xcite , exotic characteristics of the high-@xmath6 cuprates  @xcite , etc .",
    "while arups is extremely well suited to study electronic bs of low - dimensional solids , it probes the top 12 layers of the surface  @xcite . in order to determine bulk bs of 3-d correlated systems which can depend on the probed layer  @xcite ,",
    "it is meaningful to use higher energies .",
    "as the excitation energy is increased , the probing depth or mean free path(mfp ) increases  @xcite , but to date , no layer dependent variation of in - plane band dispersion ( bd ) beyond the top 2 layers has been reported . in this work , using tunable soft x - ray arpes , we study layer dependence of in - plane bds of nickel metal .    nickel is a prototype of a correlated ferromagnetic metal and has been extensively studied using pes and inverse - pes spectroscopies  @xcite . beginning with the work of slater  @xcite and stoner  @xcite ,",
    "the bs of nickel has remained a suitable testing ground for a variety of experiments and theory .",
    "recent theories have addressed the major inconsistencies with experiment : 3@xmath7 bandwidth extent , temperature(t)-dependence of magnetization , and a satellite structure which appears at about 6 ev below the fermi level(@xmath8 ) .",
    "the 3@xmath7 bandwidth and exchange splitting(es ) of nickel observed by arups are reduced by 25% and 50% , respectively  @xcite , compared to the values obtained from spin - polarized local density approximation ( s - lda ) calculations  @xcite . the 6 ev satellite obtained in pes experiments",
    "@xcite is the two - hole bound state due to correlation effects .",
    "it is missing in bs calculations in the one - electron picture  @xcite but obtained in ",
    "generalized hubbard models \"  @xcite or the  lda ( gwa ) + dmft \" ( dynamical mean - field theory )  @xcite which explicitly include coulomb interactions .",
    "a recent study discusses the inability of s - lda to reproduce the position of the minority spin state @xmath9 below @xmath8 obtained by arups  @xcite .",
    "the energy position of @xmath9 states determines the electron count associated with the hole pocket of minority spin character at @xmath10-point , which in turn influences the magnetic moment , a macroscopic property .",
    "although recent theoretical efforts reproduce the experimental bs of nickel by including correlation effects  @xcite , the results were compared with experimental bs obtained using arups .",
    "the present study reports new experimental results of the bulk bs of nickel obtained using soft x - ray arpes .",
    "experiments were performed at beam line 27su of spring-8  @xcite using linearly polarized light .",
    "total energy resolution was 50160 mev .",
    "the beam line has a figure-8 undulator  @xcite , enabling an easy switch of the polarization vector from horizontal(h)- to vertical(v)- polarization .",
    "ni(100 ) surface was prepared by ar@xmath11 sputtering and annealing .",
    "the surface was checked by core level photoemission spectra obtained using 780 ev photons and the contamination due to oxygen and carbon was measured to be @xmath12 .",
    "the surface crystallinity was confirmed to be a sharp ( 1@xmath131 ) leed pattern .",
    "arpes measures @xmath4 and @xmath5 of electrons in a solid according to the following equations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are parallel and perpendicular components of @xmath5 , respectively , @xmath18 is electron emission angle , @xmath19 is work function , and @xmath20 is inner potential .",
    "the angular resolution of the electron energy analyzer was better than @xmath210.2@xmath22 which corresponds to resolutions of about @xmath210.014 , @xmath210.021 , and @xmath210.028 ( @xmath23 ) in @xmath16 at @xmath0 = 190 , 435 , and 780 ev , respectively ( eq .  ( [ e.1 ] ) ) .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) and  ( [ e.2 ] ) indicate that when arpes with fixed @xmath0 is used for measurement of in - plane ( @xmath16 ) bds , @xmath17 also changes .",
    "the variation of @xmath17 can be substantial in arups  @xcite , but diminishes with increasing @xmath0 , making it an advantage . in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) , we plot @xmath17 versus @xmath16 in units of ( @xmath23 ) for @xmath0 = 190 , 435 ,  and 780  ev in the experimental geometry of fig .  [ f.1](b ) , using eqs .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) and  ( [ e.2 ] ) with @xmath20 = 9.3 ev .",
    "actually , the momentum transfer of the photon is not negligible in soft x - ray arpes .",
    "however , since our experimental geometry is near grazing incidence ( fig .",
    "[ f.1](b ) ) , the momentum transfer of the photon results in a constant shift of parallel component of the momentum @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is negligibly influenced  @xcite .",
    "therefore , from fig .  [",
    "f.1](a ) the spectra of @xmath16 = 0 at these @xmath0 ( 190 , 435 , and 780 ev ) are expected to probe an equivalent @xmath17 point ( @xmath24 ) in the 3-d brillouin zone ( bz ) of ni(100)(fig .  [ f.1](c ) ) .",
    "we first validate this by @xmath0-dependent arpes of @xmath16 = 0 in successive bzs ( figs .",

    "( the spectra of @xmath16 = 0 are identified from the observed band dispersion in the ( @xmath18-dependent ) arpes at each photon energy . )",

    "the similarity of spectra in figs .",
    "[ f.1](d ) and  [ f.1](e ) measured in successive bzs confirm we are at equivalent momentum regions and the @xmath24-point can be precisely measured according to eq .",
    "( [ e.2 ] ) even by soft x - ray arpes .",
    "further , since the difference of @xmath17 along @xmath24-@xmath10 ( @xmath26-line)of @xmath16 is already small with 190 ev photons ( fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) ) , the in - plane bd along @xmath24-@xmath10 can be measured by arpes with 190 , 435 , and 780 ev photons . the probing depth or mfp",
    "is estimated to be about 5 , 8 , and 12   at @xmath0 = 190 , 435 , and 780 ev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "thus we can probe up to the third , fifth , and seventh layer of equivalent regions in the 3-d bz ( figs .",
    "[ f.1](a)-(c ) ) .",
    "arpes with soft x - rays can also lead to indirect transitions caused by the phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "however , recent arpes studies with soft x - rays have shown that this can be avoided and the band dispersion can be measured by cooling the sample  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present arpes experiments were performed at 50 k to minimize the influence of thermal diffuse scattering and hence maximize the direct transition component .",
    "in figs .  [ f.1](f ) and  [ f.1](g ) we show the arpes spectra of ni(100 ) excited by 780 ev photons with h- and v - polarization , from @xmath24 to @xmath10 .",
    "the spectra show angular dependence in @xmath5-space from @xmath24 to @xmath10 due to bds , as marked with triangles . at the @xmath24-point in fig .",
    "[ f.1](f ) , the two peaks correspond to the critical points @xmath27 and @xmath28 at 1.21 ev and 0.51 ev binding energy .",
    "two bands disperse from @xmath27 towards @xmath10-point and a third band disperses from @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bands , respectively ( fig .  [ f.1](f ) ) .",
    "features due to a fourth weak band ( @xmath25 ) are also barely seen .",
    "these bds are almost consistent with arups results  @xcite . especially , the energy positions at the high symmetry @xmath24- and @xmath10-point are very consistent with ( spin - integrated ) arups results indicated by bars in fig .",
    "[ f.1](f ) .",
    "[ f.1](g ) ( v - polarization ) reproduces the energy positions of the critical points @xmath28 and @xmath32 , with consistent bds as in fig .",
    "[ f.1](f ) ( h - polarization ) , but enhances the @xmath31 band relative to other bands  @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that soft x - ray arpes can be surely used to obtain bds of solids .",
    "however , there is one important discrepancy in the present data compared with arups results .",
    "the @xmath31 band crosses the @xmath8 in the present spectra and its energy position at the @xmath10-point , that is @xmath33 , is evidently above @xmath8 .",
    "this is in contrast with arups studies  @xcite which show that the majority and minority bands of @xmath31 symmetry do not cross @xmath8 , but remain below @xmath8 all along the @xmath26-line .    as a check of the @xmath31 bd measured using @xmath0 = 780 ev , and",
    "if truly so , to investigate its deviation from arups results , we measured bds with @xmath0 = 435 and 190 ev .",
    "in order to clearly see bds , we plot band maps ( bm ) ( second derivative of raw spectra after smoothing ) . figs .",
    "[ f.2](a)-(c ) show bms made using the raw spectra shown in figs .",
    "[ f.2](d)-(f ) obtained with v - polarization using @xmath0 = 780 , 435 , and 190 ev , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) , the @xmath31 bd can be followed unambiguously and the @xmath8 crossing is clearly observed ( arrow mark ) , corresponding to the @xmath2 minority band .",
    "the @xmath34 majority bd also can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) but is more clear in figs .  [ f.2](b ) and  [ f.2](c ) , with @xmath35 located at 0.27 ev binding energy .",
    "the spectral intensity very close to the @xmath8 crossing of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) , just next to the arrow mark ) , disperses to higher binding energy and is assigned to @xmath36 .",
    "additional confirmation comes from the 435 ev bm in fig .",
    "[ f.2](b ) which shows nearly identical bds , but for a small change of the @xmath8 crossing point in @xmath5-space ( arrow mark ) .",
    "the changed bd of the @xmath2 band with 435 ev photons ( fig .  [ f.2](b ) ) results in overlapping the @xmath36 band at @xmath8 , which are separated with 780 ev photons in fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) .",
    "the most important result is obtained with the @xmath0 = 190 ev bm shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2](c ) .",
    "this bm shows well - resolved majority ( @xmath34 ) and minority ( @xmath2 ) bands .",
    "probing just beyond the arups regime changes bds which are clearly intermediate to the bulk bds ( obtained with @xmath0 = 435 and 780 ev ) and surface bds obtained by arups  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 band crosses @xmath8 at @xmath37(@xmath24-@xmath10 ) in fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) , at @xmath38(@xmath24-@xmath10 ) in fig .",
    "[ f.2](b ) , whereas it is @xmath39(@xmath24-@xmath10 ) in fig .",
    "[ f.2](c ) .",
    "the shift of the @xmath8 crossing is also seen in the raw arpes spectra ( fig .",
    "[ f.2](d)-(f ) ) , which show clear @xmath8 crossings with each photon energy(blue curves ) .",
    "the group velocity at @xmath8 also changes systematically from 0.62 ev  ( 190 ev ) , to 0.82 ev   ( 435 ev ) and 1.11 ev  ( 780 ev ) .",
    "since the @xmath2 bd changes systematically , the results indicate that the @xmath31 bandwidth and the ( @xmath40 ) es is increased in the bulk compared to the arups results . from arups",
    "the es is estimated to be 170 mev , an anomalously low es measured only for the @xmath41 point on the surface  @xcite .",
    "we next check how the @xmath8 crossing of @xmath2 is sensitive to the @xmath17-point in ni band structure .",
    "the bms with 800 ev and 760 ev photons ( fig .",
    "[ f.2](g ) and ( h ) ) , which corresponds to @xmath4210 % variation in @xmath17 along @xmath24-@xmath10(see fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) ) as compared to data obtained with 780 ev photons ( fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) ) show very similar bds and also the @xmath8 crossing of @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) .",
    "therefore , the bd is insensitive to the @xmath17 variations in the range of @xmath1 0.1(@xmath24-@xmath10 ) for high energies and the change in @xmath8 crossing is not due to a change of the @xmath17-point .",
    "since , at any photon energy , the experiments actually measure an integral of the intensity , weighted by an exponential factor for the mfp , we try to extract the bulk bd from arpes with 780 ev photons .",
    "the spectra with 780 ev photons is estimated to roughly contain about 50% contribution from the top 4 - 5 layers , which is the probing depth at @xmath0 = 435 ev .",
    "the arpes spectra with 780 ev photons is subtracted by the 435 ev spectra weighted by the exponential factor ( 0.52 ) and assuming atomic cross - sections .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2](i ) and confirms that the bd seen for bulk ni are similar to the data of fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) .",
    "in particular , the separate bds are more clear at the @xmath10 point .",
    "the data thus prove that the @xmath2 bd is different in the bulk compared to surface sensitive arups studies(overlaid as green line ) .",
    "thus , the reduced probing depth measurements indicate bulk in - plane bd of @xmath2 band systematically connects to the arups results  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 band which is pinned just below @xmath8 at @xmath10-point ( @xmath9 ) in surface sensitive arups , crosses @xmath8 in bulk sensitive arpes with @xmath9 lying above @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to an additional minority spin @xmath9 hole pocket .",
    "there exists an early spin polarized study by kisker et al .",
    "@xcite showing that the @xmath9 state lies above @xmath8 although later studies have concluded it lies below @xmath8 . in view of the present results , the larger mfp used but at very low energy ( 4 - 6 ev ) by kisker et al .",
    "@xcite reflects the bulk bs  @xcite . while de haas - van alphen measurements also showed only the @xmath43 hole pocket along @xmath24 to @xmath10  @xcite , magneto - crystalline anisotropy measurements  @xcite indicated evidence for the additional @xmath9 hole pocket .",
    "the layer dependent bd is coupled to the widening of the @xmath31 band width observed in arpes using high @xmath0 , suggesting weaker electron - electron correlations in the bulk .",
    "theoretical calculations which include coulomb correlations show that @xmath9 is located below @xmath8",
    "@xcite in contrast to s - lda calculations  @xcite and the 6 ev satellite is also reproduced  @xcite .",
    "hence , we checked for variations of arpes spectra in the 6 ev satellite region as a function of @xmath0 ( figs .",
    "[ f.3](a ) and  [ f.3](b ) ) .",
    "the arpes spectra show the @xmath25 band dispersing across and overlapping the 6 ev satellite between @xmath24 to @xmath10 , as expected from s - lda calculations  @xcite and arups studies  @xcite . even though the @xmath44 character @xmath25 band crossing makes quantification very difficult , an attempt to do so with the @xmath24 point spectra ( fig .",
    "[ f.3](c ) ) , where the @xmath25 band is separated , shows a reduction of @xmath120@xmath214% in the 6 ev satellite intensity on increasing @xmath0 from 190 to 780 ev .",
    "this reduction in intensity is small and not conclusive but suggestive of reduced correlations in the bulk  @xcite , consistent with the layer dependent change of @xmath2 band dispersion in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] . also , since the electron correlation in nickel leads to a reduced es compared to s - lda calculation  @xcite , the reduced correlation is consistent with",
    "the enhancement of es observed at @xmath33 .",
    "since the 6 ev satellite feature is still observed with 780 ev photons as in angle - integrated x - pes studies  @xcite , it shows that arpes is necessary to check for the bulk to surface changes in the valence bs . in fig .",
    "[ f.3](d ) , we plot a bm for 2.5 to 9.0 ev binding energy and @xmath0  = 780 ev , where @xmath25 bd is clearly seen , consistent with arups results .",
    "we have also confirmed that the @xmath25 bd is similar to that obtained by applying the sum rule as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another important point to note is that the @xmath30 and @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ f.1](f ) ) bds do not change with @xmath0 i.e.  as a function of probing depth . since @xmath30 and @xmath29 band originate in @xmath45-type states , it is not modified by electron correlations like the @xmath46-derived states  @xcite . even between the @xmath46-derived states , the @xmath31 band ( @xmath47 ) possibly shows more layer dependent correlation than the @xmath25 band ( @xmath48 ) since the ( @xmath47 ) orbital extends outwards along the surface normal direction ( 100 ) .",
    "this suggests similarity to recent results showing varying correlations between the @xmath45-orbitals of ( @xmath49 ) , ( @xmath50 ) , and ( @xmath51 ) symmetry for correlated oxides  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , tunable soft x - ray polarization dependent arpes makes it possible to resolve the changes in bds with specified symmetry and layers .",
    "we observe layer dependent @xmath2 band dispersion , which leads to an additional minority spin @xmath9 hole pocket .",
    "however , the @xmath30  and @xmath29   ( @xmath45)-symmetry bands are not affected by the existence of the surface . thus , the observed bulk versus surface difference in behavior of the electronic states depends on the band symmetry .",
    "the results show layer dependent bd changes , suggesting correlation effects and es being coupled to changes in the probing depth , and the importance of coulomb correlations in theoretical calculations for the surface electronic bs .",
    "soft x - ray arpes is thus shown to be a very important tool to study layer dependent bd of 3-d solids .",

    "i ( springer - verlag , berlin ) 1978 , p.  261 .    this",
