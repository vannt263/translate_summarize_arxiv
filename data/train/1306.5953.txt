    "a central effort in trapped ion quantum computation is the realization of controllable interactions between spatially separated qubits  @xcite .",
    "this is key to establishing qubit entanglement for quantum information processing  @xcite and for transferring quantum information between remote qubits  @xcite . in trapped ion quantum computation",
    "an effective qubit - qubit interaction  @xcite is typically engineered by a state - dependent laser coupling of ions to quantum harmonic oscillations ( phonons ) of the ion crystal  @xcite .",
    "this use of phonons as quantum bus is currently limited to rather small arrangements of ions as the vibrational mode structure of a crystal becomes increasingly dense and complex as the number of ions grows . executing gates in large ion crystals",
    "therefore can become very slow if one requires individual phonon modes to be spectroscopically resolved as proposed in many gate schemes  @xcite .",
    "hence , when scaling up a trapped ion quantum computer , the resulting slow gate speeds make it challenging to maintain quantum coherence within qubit which typically have a finite coherence time .",
    "an alternative to the phonon induced effective interaction among qubits are long range dipolar interactions which are currently much studied in the context of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "these interactions occur when two atoms are excited to electronically high - lying ( rydberg ) states  @xcite . depending on the specific rydberg state",
    "the corresponding interaction strength can reach tens of mhz over a distance of several micrometers .",
    "this has pronounced consequences for the excitation dynamics of atoms which are excited from electronically low - lying ( ell ) states to rydberg states . in the extreme case",
    "it can lead to the so - called dipole blockade effect @xcite , i.e. the suppression of multiple excitation of rydberg atoms within a certain volume  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been extensively explored in the context of many - body physics and it has been shown to be a central ingredient for the realization of two - qubit gates  @xcite . recently ,",
    "the experimental demonstration of two - atom entanglement  @xcite and a controlled - not quantum gate  @xcite using the dipole blockade between rydberg atoms has been reported .    motivated by this ,",
    "attempting to integrate dipolar interaction into trapped ion systems has generated considerable interest  @xcite . in terms of electronic structure , an atom and a singly charged ion in a rydberg state share many similarities .",
    "one would therefore intuitively think that one could simply migrate the ideas developed for neutral atoms to the trapped ions .",
    "however , dramatic differences between neutral rydberg atoms and trapped rydberg ions emerge in both the motional and electronic dynamics . for neutral atoms ,",
    "one commonly encounters situations where the atomic motion is frozen during the course of the rydberg excitation  @xcite .",
    "this condition can typically not be fulfilled for trapped ions and coherent couplings between electronic states and phonon motions are vitally important for understanding the trapped ion excitation dynamics",
    ".     ions form a crystal along the @xmath1-axis of the linear paul trap .",
    "the equilibrium position of the @xmath2-th ion is @xmath3 . in rydberg",
    "states the size of the valance electron orbit becomes comparable or even larger than the width of the ionic wave packet ( sketched as gaussian in gray ) .",
    "the two ions ( separated by @xmath4 ) interact through a dipolar interactions once excited to rydberg states .",
    "( b ) relevant electronic levels used to describe the laser excitation and the mw dressing . a laser couples the low - lying @xmath5-state with the target rydberg state , @xmath6 .",
    "the mw field couples the @xmath6-state with a rydberg @xmath7-state .",
    "( c ) for a strong mw field , the dressed rydberg states are separated by a large energy splitting given by the microwave rabi frequency . here",
    ", the selective laser addressing of individual mw dressed rydberg state is possible.,width=307 ]    in rydberg states the weakly bound electron can strongly couple to the ionic vibration .",
    "this is rooted in the fact that the rydberg ion can not be regarded as a point - like particle but rather a composite object  @xcite : the orbital length of the rydberg electron scales as @xmath8  @xcite ( with @xmath9 the principal quantum number of the rydberg state ) .",
    "this length can be tens of nm at large @xmath9 , which is several times larger than the typical oscillator length corresponding to the ionic vibration , @xmath10 nm ( the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : level]a ) . the strong coupling not only affects the electronic dynamics but also generates an additional ponderomotive potential for the external ionic motion  @xcite .",
    "this potential is proportional to rydberg polarizability ( @xmath11 ) and thus modifies significantly the rydberg ion trapping potential compared to ions in ell states .",
    "this affects the laser excitation of ions from ell states to a rydberg state through the emergence of non - trivial franck - condon ( fc ) factors which characterize the overlap of phonon modes belonging to the two different potential surfaces . in general",
    "this leads to the mixing of vibrational state during the laser excitation which can cause qubit decoherence .",
    "in addition a second issue arises , namely that the dipolar interaction between rydberg ions is generally weaker than between neutral rydberg atoms .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction ( which typically is used to establish interactions among rydberg atoms ) scales as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the net charge of the ionic core .",
    "this scaling immediately shows that the vdw interaction strength of rydberg ions ( with @xmath14 ) is relatively weak compared to neutral atoms ( with @xmath15 ) .",
    "indeed , we will later show for the case of ca@xmath0 and typical trap parameters that it is not advantageous to use the vdw interaction for realizing two - qubit gates .    in this work",
    "we show how to overcome these two problems .",
    "our solution relies on the application of a microwave ( mw ) field which couples ionic rydberg states which have a polarizability of opposite signs ( see level scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : level]b ) . the polarizability of the emerging dressed rydberg states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : level]c ) can be dynamically switched off . in this case",
    "the difference of the potential surface of ions in the rydberg state and the ell states is lifted and the rydberg excitation decouples from the phonon dynamics .",
    "in addition , the large permanent ( rotating ) dipole moment of the mw dressed rydberg states generates a dipole - dipole ( dd ) interaction which is substantially stronger than the vdw interaction .",
    "this permits the implementation of a fast and robust quantum gate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this will have an impact , e.g. , on the laser excitation dynamics . in the following",
    "we will discuss this in detail .      in an ell state , the dynamics of the valence electron is hardly affected by the electric fields of the trap and the electronic and phonon dynamics are essentially decoupled . at sufficiently low temperature",
    "the ions form a wigner crystal as a result of interplay between the coulomb repulsion and the trap confinement  @xcite . for our linear two - ion crystal",

    "we find that the population @xmath183 of the initial state @xmath200 slightly deviates from the probability to remain in the state @xmath192 , which is obtained by tracing out the cm phonons .",
    "the same behavior is found for other pair states which indicates that there is a slight population of the phonon states during the laser pulse .",
    "the magnitude of this phonon excitation is controlled by the trap frequency and can be reduced to an arbitrary degree if the confinement strength is increased .",
    "let us briefly discuss further gate errors caused by the spontaneous decay of ions from the rydberg state . for @xmath146 , the lifetime of the mw dressed @xmath84 state is @xmath201s .",
    "the corresponding loss from the pair states @xmath182 and @xmath202 can be estimated by @xmath203 with @xmath204 being the excitation probability in the state @xmath182 .",
    "this loss can be further reduced by increasing the gate speed and considering even higher rydberg states with longer lifetimes .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the implementation of a two - qubit phase gate in trapped ions which relies on the dipolar interaction between ionic rydberg states .",
    "we have discussed in detail a number of technical difficulties which highlight central differences with respect to the implementation of similar gates among neutral atoms , and showed that they can be in principle overcome by utilizing mw dressed rydberg states . based on these dressed states",
    "we have briefly discussed the implementation of a controlled two - qubit phase gate and gave a first account on the effect of the electron - phonon coupling on the gate dynamics . in the future , it will be interesting to extend our analysis to larger ion crystals with thermal phonon states , in order to assess the usefulness of dipolar interactions for achieving a scalable ion trap quantum computer .",
