    "the electric field is mainly directed along the @xmath34-axis , i.e. parallel to the electric field in the laser excitation region .",
    "hence , molecules that were initially prepared in a @xmath21 sublevel and have not made a microwave transition will not be deflected .",

    "@xcite , but is a 100 times more accurate .    an important motivation for this work is to estimate the possible accuracy that might be obtained on the two - photon transition connecting the @xmath10 level to the @xmath60 level that is exceptionally sensitive to a possible time - variation of the fundamental constants  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this transition is that the @xmath61 transition can be measured directly , thus avoiding the problems with the stability of the magnetic bias field .",
    "a disadvantage is that the population in the @xmath62 level is much smaller than the population in the @xmath18 level , reducing the number of molecules that is observed , while the stark shift is considerable less , making it necessary to use a longer deflection field .    in order to obtain a constraint on the time - variation of @xmath11 at the level of 5.6 @xmath63 10@xmath64/yr , the current best limit set by spectroscopy on sf@xmath65  @xcite",
    ", we would need to record the @xmath66 two - photon transition at 1.6ghz with an accuracy 0.03  hz over an interval of one year . to reach this precision within a realistic measurement time , say 24 hours",
    ", the number of detected molecules should be at least 2500 per shot , i.e. , 50 times more than detected in the current experiment but now starting from the less populated @xmath62 level .",
    "although challenging , this seems possible by using a more efficient detector  @xcite and/or by using quadrupole or hexapole lenses to collimate the molecular beam  @xcite .",
