    "decades before the nucleon substructure was discovered , numerous models were developed that successfully describe most nuclear phenomena only in terms of nucleons , their excited states and strong force mediators - mesons .",
    "nucleons and mesons are often called the `` conventional '' degrees of freedom of nuclear physics .",
    "the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , describes physical processes in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "qcd is very successful in describing the interaction of quarks at short distances , where perturbative methods , similar to those of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in atomic physics , are applicable .",
    "however , the same perturbative methods can not be applied to solve qcd at the length scales of a nucleus .",
    "the present difficulty to make rigorous predictions based on qcd at low momenta ( corresponding to large distance scales ) leaves us no choice but to continue to employ nuclear theories based on `` effective '' degrees of freedom - nucleons and mesons . in an attempt to resolve this discontinuity of theories ,",
    "the focus of modern nuclear physics has turned to the intermediate region where qcd is not yet solvable , but the quark - gluon substructure of the nucleons must be taken into account in the nuclear models .",
    "one example of the interface between a hadronic and a quark - based description is the ( possible ) modification of the ( quark ) structure of a nucleon that is part of a tightly bound pair . due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle",
    ", large momenta of the nucleons inside the nucleus can be associated with small internucleon spatial separations .",
    "the kinematical conditions are particularly clean in the case of the deuteron , where the relative motion of the two nucleons is completely described by the wave function in momentum space , @xmath7 . in all models of the deuterium nucleus ,",
    "the nucleons have mostly low momenta and therefore are relatively far apart .",
    "however , even in the wave functions obtained from non - relativistic models of the nucleon - nucleon potential , there is a probability for the nucleons to have momenta high enough so that the proton and neutron can come very close together or even overlap . in such high density configurations",
    "the quark distribution within a nucleon can become modified either through off - shell effects @xcite or through direct modification of the shape and size of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that under these conditions the nucleons start to exchange quarks with each other or even merge into a single `` six - quark bag '' @xcite .",
    "the quark - gluon degrees of freedom thus might play a direct role in modifying nucleon structure in high - density nuclear configurations .",
    "the analysis presented here is aimed at advancing the understanding of high density , high momentum nuclear matter .    to study these high density configurations ,",
    "we have used electron scattering from a high - momentum nucleon within a nucleus . in the case of a deuteron target",
    "this can be easily verified by taking advantage of the inherently simple structure of the two - nucleon system .",
    "if all the momentum and energy is transferred to the neutron , the proton is a spectator to the reaction and recoils with its initial momentum . assuming that the detected proton was indeed a spectator to the reaction",
    ", the initial momentum of the struck neutron can be obtained using momentum conservation .",
    "thus the neutron is `` tagged '' by the backward going spectator proton ( for a extensive discussion of the spectator picture see , e.g. , the papers by simula  @xcite and meltnitchouk _ et al . _",
    "measurement of a high - momentum proton emitted backwards relative to the momentum transfer direction allows us to infer that the electron interacted with a high - momentum neutron in deuterium .",
    "energy conservation applied to the deuterium nucleus requires that the total energy of the proton and neutron bound within a deuteron equals the mass of the deuterium nucleus :    @xmath8    at the same time , the mass of the deuteron is less than the mass of a free proton plus the mass of a free neutron , @xmath9 . therefore , both the bound neutron and proton can not be on the mass shell at the same time . in the `` instant form '' dynamics , one of the nucleons",
    "is assumed to be on - shell , while the other one is off - shell and its off - shell energy is @xmath10 .",
    "the final state motion of the on - shell ( `` spectator '' ) nucleon can be described by its momentum @xmath2 or the light cone fraction",
    "@xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spectator proton momentum 4-vector .",
    "the component @xmath14 of the proton momentum is in the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is transverse to @xmath15 .    using a non - relativistic wave function @xmath17 ,",
    "the `` target density '' of neutrons which are correlated with spectator protons of momentum @xmath2 can be expressed as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a flux factor that accounts for the motion of the struck nucleon .",
    "the probability @xmath20 is related to the spectral function : @xmath21 which yields @xmath22 .    in the light - cone dynamics framework",
    ", a non - relativistic deuterium wave function can be rescaled to account for relativistic effects at high momenta @xcite : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath11 is the light - cone fraction of the nucleus carried by the spectator nucleon and @xmath26 is its internal momentum , with @xmath27 .",
    "the relativistic effect , in this picture , manifests itself in that the measured momentum of the nucleon @xmath14 is rescaled in the lab frame from the internal momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting deuterium momentum distribution is given by the spectral function : @xmath29 the spectral function is normalized to satisfy the relation : @xmath30 in the pwia spectator approximation , the recoiling proton is on - shell at the moment of interaction and receives no energy or momentum transfer , so that its initial and final momenta in the lab are the same .",
    "the differential cross - section on a moving nucleon ( with kinematics defined by the spectator variables @xmath31 ) can then be calculated as : @xmath32\\\\ \\times f_{2}(x^{*},\\alpha_{s},p_{t},q^{2})\\cdot s(\\alpha_{s},p_{t})\\frac{d\\alpha_{s}}{\\alpha_{s}}d^{2}p_{t}\\end{array } , \\label{eq : ccoffshell}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the probability to find a spectator with the given kinematics . in this expression",
    ", @xmath34 is the `` off ",
    "shell '' structure function of the struck neutron and @xmath35 is the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse cross sections .",
    "the asterisk is used for variables that have been defined in a manifestly covariant way .",
    "for instance , the bjorken scaling variable @xmath36 and the variable @xmath37 that are valid for the scattering from a free nucleon at rest are replaced with their counterparts for the scattering on a moving neutron inside the deuteron : @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the momentum transfer 4-vector , @xmath41 is the momentum 4-vector of the incident electron , @xmath42 is the momentum 4-vector of the off - shell neutron and @xmath43 is the mass of the deuterium nucleus . in this approximation",
    "the struck nucleon is assumed to be on the energy shell , but off its mass shell .",
    "the mass of the free nucleon @xmath44 is therefore replaced with the off - shell mass of the bound nucleon : @xmath45 the invariant mass of the final hadronic state in @xmath46 scattering can be expressed as : @xmath47 where it was assumed that @xmath48 . in the ( bjorken )",
    "limit of @xmath49 the fraction in the brackets of the last term in equation ( [ eq : wstar ] ) takes the familiar form of the light - cone fraction of the nucleus carried by the spectator proton @xmath50 , yielding : @xmath51    if one assumes that @xmath52 is equal to its on - shell form , @xmath53 , and integrates over the spectator kinematics , one obtains the usual convolution result for the inclusive nuclear structure function @xmath54 . in this picture the nucleus is built from free nucleons , i.e. the struck nucleon has the same quark distribution as a free nucleon .",
    "any observed modification of the cross section from that of a collection of free nucleons is just due to the kinematic rescaling ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : x_star ] ) because of the motion of the nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "however , the difference in the @xmath55 dependence of the inclusive deep inelastic cross section for free and bound nucleons observed by the european muon collaboration ( known as the emc - effect @xcite ) , can not be interpreted solely in terms of such a kinematic shift .",
    "a large number of models have been proposed to explain the emc - effect .",
    "a good review of this subject is given by sargsian _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "the most conservative approach assumes that any modification of the bound nucleon structure function is solely due to the fact that the struck nucleon is off its mass shell ( @xmath56 ) ; for example see ref .  @xcite .",
    "other models invoke a change of the nucleon size and therefore a rescaling of the structure function with momentum transfer @xmath57 , as in ref .",
    "frankfurt and strikman  @xcite link the modifications to the structure function with a suppression of small ( point - like ) valence configurations of a strongly bound nucleon .",
    "the most unconventional attempt to explain the emc - effect is that of carlson and lassila @xcite where nucleons inside of a nucleus in its high - density configuration are thought to merge and form multiquark states .",
    "for the case of deuterium , as much as 5% of the wave function would be in a 6-quark state in this model .",
    "the cross section for backward proton production is then expressed as a convolution of the distribution function for the valence quarks in a 6-quark cluster @xmath58 and the fragmentation function for the 5-quark residuum into a backward proton , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "although all of these models can describe at least some aspects of the emc ",
    "effect , they predict considerably different changes of the internal structure of deeply bound nucleons . these changes are masked in inclusive measurements , where one averages over all bound nucleons , most of which are below the fermi surface . by selecting tightly bound nucleon pairs ( with a fast backward going spectator as `` tag '' )",
    ", our experiment can study these possible modifications more directly .",
    "the pwia picture described above has to be modified to include the effect of final state interactions ( fsi ) and two - body currents ( meson exchange currents ) .",
    "according to existing models ( see below ) , there are kinematic regions where fsi are thought to be small , and other regions where fsi are enhanced .",
    "reliable models of fsi exist for nucleon - nucleon rescattering  @xcite . in the resonant and deep inelastic region ,",
    "the estimation of fsi is a lot more challenging .",
    "fsi can be modeled by replacing the spectral function in eq .",
    "[ eq : ccoffshell ] with a distorted one : @xmath61 .",
    "melnitchouk , sargsian and strikman @xcite use the @xmath62 reaction as a first estimate of fsi in electron scattering from the deuteron .",
    "this calculation shows that for @xmath63 and @xmath16 close to zero fsi are small . in this model @xmath64",
    "is evaluated using a distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) . according to this paper",
    ", fsi effects should not strongly depend on @xmath55 , thus the ratios of the cross section for different ranges in @xmath55 should be a good tool to look for the emc - effect in the semi - inclusive @xmath65 process . in the limit of large @xmath55 , fsi",
    "become much more important for heavier nuclei , where rescattering hadrons produced in the elementary deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off the short - range correlation are dynamically enhanced . therefore , deuterium targets , in the authors opinion , provide the best way of studying the origin of the emc effect .    a more recent publication by cioffi _ et al .",
    "@xcite discusses backward proton production and fsi associated with dis by evaluating @xmath64 within a hadronization framework .",
    "the reinteraction of the backward - going spectator protons with the debris formed in a hadronization process is modeled using an effective cross section : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the total nucleon - nucleon and meson - nucleon cross sections , respectively , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the effective numbers of created mesons and radiated gluons .",
    "the cross section asymptotically tends to exhibit a simple logarithmic behavior .",
    "the magnitude of the effective reinteraction cross section differs significantly for different models , especially at angles of proton emission @xmath71 .",
    "this kinematic region is proposed by the authors as the best place to test various models of hadronization .",
    "in contrast with the calculation discussed in the beginning of the section , the model of @xcite predicts significant fsi for proton momenta @xmath72 even at extreme backward angles .",
    "few data exist on the semi - inclusive scattering of a lepton from deuterium with a recoiling nucleon in the backward direction with respect to the momentum transfer .",
    "the data published so far were taken using either neutrino or antineutrino beams and had very low statistics that do not allow detailed investigation of the cross sections of interest . these experiments ( see berge and efremenko @xcite ) focused on measuring the momentum , energy , and angular distributions of protons in the backward hemisphere relative to the beam line .",
    "despite the low statistics , a notable difference in the distributions for backward and forward protons was observed .",
    "the data were shown to agree well with a pair - correlation model in which the detected backward proton is assumed to be a spectator to the reaction .",
    "the cross section ratio @xmath73 measured by the european muon collaboration @xcite ( where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are cross sections per nucleon for iron and deuterium respectively ) showed deviations from unity ( now known as the emc - effect ) that could not be explained only in terms of nucleon fermi motion .",
    "that was the first evidence that the nuclear medium influences dis processes .",
    "it provided an indication that nuclear matter is getting modified as its density increases .",
    "the effect was later confirmed by data from slac @xcite and cern @xcite .",
    "an independent measurement of the modification of the quark structure of nuclei was later done at fermilab @xcite using continuum dimuon production in high - energy hadron collisions , known as the drell - yan process @xcite .",
    "the measurement has shown no nuclear dependence in the production of the dimuon pairs in the region @xmath76 , and therefore , no modification of the antiquark sea in this range .",
    "a number of models developed to explain the emc - effect in terms of strong enhancement of the pion cloud were ruled out by this experiment .",
    "a recent polarization transfer measurement by dieterich and strauch @xcite in the @xmath77 reaction suggested medium modification of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the observed 10% deviation from unity could only be explained by supplementing the conventional nuclear description with effects due to medium modification of the nucleon as calculated by the qmc model @xcite .    a model in which the neutron and proton form a single 6-quark cluster was recently tested @xcite against old backward proton production data from neutrino scattering on deuterium collected at fermilab @xcite .",
    "these data had sufficient acceptance for backward protons but were not previously analyzed for this signal . the proton spectrum from neutrino and antineutrino scattering from deuterium , taken at cern @xcite , was also discussed .",
    "the authors compared the momentum distribution of backward protons with the prediction of a 6-quark cluster model .",
    "predictions of the model were shown to be in good agreement with the data , however , the statistics of the data were not sufficient to study the dependence on any other kinematic variables .    in summary",
    ", existing data on inelastic scattering off nuclei average over at least some of the relevant kinematic variables ( @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and the momentum of the struck nucleon ) and are often limited in statistics . only a more detailed analysis of",
    "the dependence of the cross section on these variables can yield clear distinctions between different models and theoretical descriptions of nucleons bound in nuclei .",
    "the experiment on the reaction   described here is the first to collect sufficient statistics for this purpose .",
    "the data were collected over a period of 46 calendar days in february and march of 2002 at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) .",
    "we used a 5.75 gev electron beam with an average current of @xmath78 .",
    "the experiment was staged in hall b of the tjnaf , where the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) is installed .",
    "six superconducting magnetic coils divide clas into six sectors symmetrically located around the beamline .",
    "each sector covers almost @xmath79 in azimuthal angle and between @xmath80 and @xmath81 in polar angle , thus providing almost @xmath82 acceptance for charged particles .",
    "clas sectors are equipped with identical sets of detector systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clas ] ) : 1 ) three regions of drift chambers ( dc ) track charged particle s passage though the region of magnetic field ; 2 ) a layer of scintillating paddles form the clas time - of - flight system ( tof ) ; 3 ) the cherenkov counters ( cc ) are installed in the forward region ( @xmath83 ) of the detector and efficiently discriminate electrons from pions up to the particle momenta @xmath84 ; 4 ) several layers of lead and scintillating paddles form the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ec ) designed to separate electrons from minimum ionizing particles .",
    "clas is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a conical cryogenic @xmath85 target , installed in the center of clas , was filled with liquid deuterium at a temperature of 22 k and pressure of 1315 mbar with a density of @xmath86 .",
    "the average beam current of 8 na produced a luminosity of @xmath87 .",
    "the clas trigger was formed by a coincidence between cc and ec . the signal level for the trigger coincidence",
    "was set to be at least 1 photoelectron in cc and 0.5 gev in ec .",
    "the level 2 trigger required a dc track candidate in the sector of the calorimeter hit . with this trigger configuration ,",
    "the data rate was about @xmath88 and the dead time was usually less than 13% .",
    "out of 4.5 billion events collected over the experimental run , only 350 thousand contain an electron in coincidence with a backward proton .",
    "the typical event of that type detected in clas is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clas ] .",
    "the collected data sample has wide coverage in kinematics of the electron and proton ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_cov ] ) . the momentum transfer @xmath3 ranges between 1.2 and @xmath89 , while the invariant mass covers the quasi - elastic , resonant and deep inelastic regions .",
    "protons were detected at large angles relative to the momentum transfer vector @xmath90 , up to angles of @xmath91 and with momenta above @xmath92 gev / c .",
    "in this section we discuss all the key analysis steps that led to the extraction of the final results .      the focus of this analysis is the @xmath93 reaction , therefore events containing coincidences between the scattered electron and recoiling proton have to be selected first .",
    "the scattered relativistic electron is expected to be the first particle that arrives at the detectors after interacting with the target nucleus .",
    "the particle was identified as an electron if it was the first in the event and its charge was measured by the dc to be negative .",
    "electron identification ( i d ) cuts on the response of two of the remaining detector systems , cc and ec , reduce the background of @xmath94 in the electron spectrum .",
    "the cc are very efficient in pion rejection up to @xmath95 , where pions start to emit cherenkov light . for lower momenta of the particle @xmath96 gev",
    "/ c a software cut of 2.5 photoelectrons was required to identify an electron . for the part of the data with particle momentum @xmath97 gev / c ,",
    "a software cut of 1 photoelectron was used ( and the fiducial region increased - see below ) to increase acceptance .",
    "the electron produces an electromagnetic shower in the ec immediately after it enters , while pions make mostly a minimum ionizing signal with a small sampling fraction ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the minimum ionizing particles can be easily rejected by requiring that the visible energy deposited in the first 15 layers of the ec is @xmath99 and the total visible energy in the ec is @xmath100 .    in order to reduce the systematic uncertainty in the quality of electron identification ,",
    "detector fiducial cuts are applied .",
    "the fiducial region of cc is known to be within the limits of the ec fiducial region ; therefore only a cc cut needs to be applied .",
    "we defined the fiducial region such that the cc was at least 90% efficient .",
    "in addition to the particle charge information , the dcs also measure the length from the target to the tof system and the curvature of the track . from the curvature of the track",
    "the particle momentum can be reconstructed .",
    "the proton is identified using tof time measurement ( @xmath101 ) and dc momentum ( @xmath102 ) and track length ( @xmath103 ) information .",
    "assuming a positively charged particle is a proton , its velocity is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is proton mass .",
    "then the time the proton travels from the target to the tof is @xmath106 .",
    "the particle is identified as a proton if the time difference @xmath107 , corrected for the event start time , is within a time window @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "a vertex cut is applied to ensure that the interaction took place within the volume of the target .",
    "the electron was required to have a vertex @xmath110 while the proton vertex cut was set to @xmath111 ( the target extends from -2.5 cm to 2.5 cm ) .",
    "additionally the vertex difference between @xmath112 and @xmath113 was required to be less than @xmath114 to reduce the background from accidental coincidences .",
    "the geometrical and structural complexity of clas is responsible for minor discrepancies in the measurement of the momentum and direction of a particle .",
    "these discrepancies are thought to be primarily due to the uncertainty in the magnetic field map and dc position .",
    "the effect of a displacement of the drift chambers and possible discrepancies in the measured magnetic field on the measured scattering angle @xmath115 and momentum @xmath116 can be parameterized .",
    "the correction function contains 8 parameters describing the drift chamber displacements and rotations and 8 parameters describing the possible uncertainties in the magnitude of the magnetic field on the path of the particle .",
    "these parameters can be determined using multi - particle exclusive reactions which are fully contained within the clas acceptance . in an exclusive reaction all of the products of the reactions",
    "are detected and no mass is missing .",
    "therefore , the kinematics of the reaction are fully defined and the goodness of fit can be evaluated using momentum and energy conservation .",
    "more details on this method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for low - energy protons ( @xmath117 )",
    "energy loss in the target and detector is significant and needs to be corrected for .",
    "this energy loss was studied with the clas geant simulation and an appropriate correction was applied to the data .      even after the i d cuts described above",
    ", pions remain a non - negligible background in the electron spectrum .",
    "their contribution needs to be estimated and appropriate corrections applied to the data .",
    "this was done using a sample of pions within ec cuts of @xmath118 gev and @xmath119 gev .",
    "the spectrum of photoelectrons in the cherenkov counters of this pion sample was scaled such that the sum of the normalized spectrum and that of a `` perfect '' electron sample ( from a simulation normalized to data within a tight ec cut ) agreed with the measured cherenkov spectrum for electron candidates within our regular ec cuts .",
    "this normalized pion spectrum was then integrated above the software i d cuts of 2.5 and 1.0 photoelectrons ( depending on the data momentum range ) and used to estimate the fraction of pions remaining in the electron sample after the cherenkov i d cut .",
    "this fraction was fit to an exponential in pion energy and the resulting estimate of the pion contamination ( ranging to no more than 6% ) was used to correct the extracted data .",
    "a similar technique was used to measure the rate of positrons relative to that of electrons , by taking positive charge tracks and fitting their energy spectrum in the ec with a combination of `` pure '' pions ( based on cherenkov response ) and `` golden electrons '' ( very high cherenkov cut ) .",
    "this positron to electron ratio can be used to estimate the fraction of the detected electrons which were not scattered from the beam but came from pair production @xmath120 or the dalitz decay @xmath121 . once again , an exponential fit to the ratio was used to estimate this contamination for all kinematic bins and correct our final data accordingly .    despite the vertex cuts there is still a chance of having an accidental coincidence between an electron and a proton in the data sample .",
    "the background of accidentals has to be estimated and subtracted . at the same time ,",
    "the loss of `` true '' protons due to the time and vertex cuts has to be determined .",
    "a purely accidental proton was defined as a positively charged particle with the time - of - flight measured by the tof to be at least 12 ns longer than the expected time - of - flight of a proton with that momentum .",
    "the time window for the accidental proton was taken to be 9 ns , the same as the proton i d time window , so that the expected arrival time for the accidental proton would not be more than 21 ns different from the expected arrival time of the real proton . in the case where the time window of accidentals is less than 5 ns away from",
    "when the deuteron ( from elastic scattering events ) would have arrived at the tof counter , the accidental proton is defined to be within a 9 ns window starting at 5 ns after the expected arrival time of a deuterium ion .",
    "the average background of accidental coincidences per nanosecond of the proton time vertex was calculated from the rate in the `` accidental time window '' described above and compared with the unbiased data sample of coincidences with good proton pid .",
    "the level of understanding of accidentals was also tested using the simulation results .",
    "the sum of the measured accidentals and the simulation is in agreement with the data on good electron - proton coincidences as selected by pid cuts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acc ] ) .",
    "a small discrepancy on the positive side of the @xmath122 distribution is due to another type of unwanted coincidences where a particle originating from the first electron vertex reinteracts further along the target cell , liberating a ( backward ) proton which arrives on - time with respect to the tof .",
    "protons produced in such a way enhance the positive side of the vertex difference distribution .",
    "the selected sample of accidentals contains only off - time events , and therefore does not fully reproduce the shape of the vertex difference distribution .",
    "a properly scaled sample of these excess events was added to the sample of purely accidental coincidences defined using off - time protons .      to extract absolute results from our experimental data",
    ", the detector acceptance has to be evaluated and an appropriate correction applied to the data .",
    "an idealized model of all the detector systems of clas is implemented in the code known as `` gsim '' .",
    "the program is built on the foundation of the geant simulation software package , supported by cern .",
    "gsim allows simulation of the detector response to a propagating particle , simulating energy loss as well as emission of secondary particles during the passage of the particle through parts of the detector .",
    "after the response of the ideal detector is simulated , existing detector inefficiencies are introduced .",
    "this is done using a separate program called `` gpp '' ( gsim post - processor ) .",
    "gpp uses precompiled information on dead regions of the dc and tof to remove the signal for these parts of clas from the gsim output .",

    "the nucleon form factors were taken from ref .",

    "the free neutron structure function @xmath124 was extracted from fits to the world data on the deuteron in a self - consistent manner by ensuring that our model , integrated over all spectator kinematics and summed over both proton and neutron contributions to electron scattering , agrees with those fits .",
    "three different versions of the code were compiled to satisfy our needs for simulation of electron scattering on @xmath125 : 1 ) elastic scattering on one nucleon in the deuteron ( with the other being a spectator ) , including the elastic radiative tail ; 2 ) inelastic scattering on one nucleon in the deuteron ( with and without radiative corrections ) ; and 3 ) elastic scattering off the deuteron nucleus as a whole .",
    "radiative effects can be included in the simulation following the prescription by mo and tsai  @xcite . in the first two cases ,",
    "these radiative corrections are applied to the electron scattering cross section for the struck nucleon in its rest frame , while the spectator simply determines the kinematic transformation into the lab system .",
    "the generator is capable of simulating both inclusive   ( by adding the first two processes for both protons and neutrons with the third one ) and semi - inclusive   processes , which is controlled by a configuration file .",
    "while this generator may not be very realistic in its description of the underlying physical processes ( since it does not contain fsi , non - nucleonic currents in deuterium , or modifications of the nucleon structure function for off ",

    "the high event count of the monte carlo assures that the statistical error of the data points are not dominated by the statistical error of the simulation .",
