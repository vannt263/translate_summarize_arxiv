    "since the proposal of bagger - lambert - gusstavson ( blg ) model@xcite , three - dimensional supersymmetric chern - simons theories have attracted a great interest as low energy effective theories of multiple m2-branes in various backgrounds .",
    "blg model is @xmath5 chern - simons theory with bi - fundamental matter fields which possesses @xmath6 supersymmetry .",
    "this is the first example of interacting chern - simons theory with @xmath7 supersymmetry . following the blg model , various chern - simons theories with @xmath7",
    "have been constructed @xcite , and their properties have been studied intensively .    in this paper , we discuss a field - operator correspondence in ads@xmath8/cft@xmath9 . in general field - operator correspondence",
    "claims that there is one - to - one correspondence between gauge invariant operators in cft and fields in the ads space , and is one of most important claims of ads / cft correspondence . for the @xmath10 chern - simons theory , aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ( abjm ) model@xcite , we need to take account of monopole operators to reproduce the desired moduli spaces@xcite .",
    "namely , some of kaluza - klein modes on the gravity side correspond to local operators carrying magnetic charges .",
    "( see also @xcite for similar analysis for blg mode . )",
    "monopole operators in abjm model are further investigated in @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in theories with less supersymmetries . in the case of @xmath11 quiver gauge theories which describe m2-branes in toric calabi - yau @xmath12-folds ,",
    "the relation between mesonic operators and holomorphic monomial functions , which are specified by the charges of toric @xmath1 symmetries , was proposed in @xcite . in the reference , a simple prescription to establish concrete correspondence between kaluza - klein modes and mesonic operators",
    "is given by utilizing brane crystals@xcite .",
    "when this method was proposed , it had not been realized that the quiver gauge theories are actually quiver chern - simons theories . after the importance of the existence of chern - simons terms",
    "was realized , this proposal was confirmed@xcite for special kind of brane crystals which can be regarded as `` m - theory lift '' of brane tilings@xcite .",
    "monopole operators enter the correspondence again as well as the case of abjm model .",
    "the results in @xcite indicate , however , that the set of primary operators corresponding to the supergravity kaluza - klein modes includes only a special kind of monopole operators , `` diagonal '' monopole operators , which carries only the diagonal @xmath1 magnetic charge and are constructed by combining the dual photon fields and chiral matter fields .",
    "( we now consider abelian quiver chern - simons theories and assume that the gauge group for each vertex is @xmath1 . )",
    "the other monopole operators , which we call non - diagonal monopole operators , have no correspondents in the bulk kaluza - klein modes . in @xcite",
    ", it is suggested that such non - diagonal monopole operators correspond to m2-branes wrapped on @xmath13-cycles in the internal space .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study this correspondence in more detail for @xmath0 abelian quiver chern - simons theories described by circular quiver diagrams@xcite .",
    "because we consider abelian chern - simons theory , whose gauge group is the product of @xmath1 , the dual geometry has large curvature . by this reason , we mainly focus only on the charges of global symmetries , which are quantized and are hopefully reproduced on the gravity side correctly .",
    "we do not attempt to reproduce the conformal dimension of monopole operators by using the gravity description .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly explain the relation between the dual photon field and monopole operators in quiver chern - simons theories . in  [ radial.sec ] we review the radial quantization method used in @xcite to compute the conformal dimension and global @xmath1 charges of monopole operators . after explaining the @xmath0 chern - simons theory in  [ n4.sec ] and the structure of the dual geometry in  [ int.sec ] , we discuss the duality between non - diagonal primary monopole operators and wrapped m2-branes in  [ pmo.sec ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "to briefly review basic facts about monopole operators , let us consider a generic @xmath11 quiver chern - simons theory described by a connected quiver diagram with @xmath14 vertices .",
    "we label vertices and edges by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the gauge group of every vertex is @xmath1 .",

    "we also proposed that the quantum number @xmath38 may represent the spin of excited m2-branes .    in this paper we considered abelian chern - simons theories only .",
    "it is important to generalize the analysis to non - abelian case .",
    "then , we can take the large @xmath135 limit , and more reliable analysis on the gravity side becomes possible .",
    "furthermore , such a generalization enables us to study the relation between general discrete torsion and spectrum of monopole operators .",
    "if we take a general discrete torsion quantized by ( [ conskk2 ] ) , the quantization of the momentum @xmath112 is changed .",
    "this should be realized as the monopole spectrum .",
    "more challenging issue is the generalization to theories with less supersymmetries . in the case of @xmath175 ,",
    "the large quantum corrections are expected and the r - charges may be largely corrected . on the gravity side ,",
    "two - cycles have in general non - vanishing area , and in such a case the computation on the gravity side predicts the conformal dimension of order @xmath176 .",
