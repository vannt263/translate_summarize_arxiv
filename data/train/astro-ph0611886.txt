    "* ) are able to reproduce the properties of present - day elliptical galaxies by assuming that their vigorous star formation at high redshift is quenched by the feedback ( i.e. galactic winds ) .",
    "this process is likely triggered by the qso activity fed by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the center of the galaxy itself ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". in this framework the detailed determination of properties of high redshift qsos is fundamental in understanding the phenomena driving galaxy formation .",
    "in particular the study of the luminosity function ( lf ) provides strong constraints for the physical mechanisms involved .",
    "a great improvement in the determination of this statistical quantity has been achieved thanks to the large amount of data coming from major observational programs such as the _ two degree field qso redshift survey _ ( 2qz , * ? ? ? * ) and in particular the third edition of the _ sloan digital sky survey _ quasar catalog ( dr3qso , * ? ? ?",
    "however , at high redshift the sdss is sensitive only to the brightest qsos ; on the other hand the faint - end of the high - z qso lf plays a key role for comparing different predictions of the formation and evolution of galaxies . in this work",
    "we estimate the qso lf and space density at @xmath3 , down to @xmath4 .",
    "we combine a bright quasar sample extracted from the dr3qso , with a faint sample recently determined by @xcite and @xcite using optical and x - ray observations in the framework of the _ great observatories origins deep survey _",
    "( goods ) project .",
    "the selection of qso candidates at different redshift in sdss field has been carried out using color criteria : @xcite presented the updated version of these criteria and in the following we use their eq .  6 and  7 as sdss selection criteria to select a high - z qsos sample out of the dr3qso .",
    "the dr3qso is a sample with an incomplete spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we consider those objects in the sdss photometric catalogue that satisfy the sdss criteria and we compare them to the corresponding sdss spectroscopic catalogue : this way , we estimate that @xmath5 of the high - z qso candidates have a spectrum .    in order to select a sample of faint qsos from the goods catalogues we consider the optical catalogues obtained using the acs ( advanced camera for surveys ) in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 bands @xcite .",

    "expected qso colors in different photometric systems are estimated as a function of redshift using a template spectrum of @xcite for the qso spectral energy distribution ( sed ) convolved with a model of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption .",
    "four optical criteria has been tailored to select qsos in the redshift interval @xmath16 as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these color selection criteria are known to select a broad range of high-@xmath10 agn , not limited to broad - lined ( type-1 ) qsos , and are less stringent than those typically used to identify high-@xmath10 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , within an error radius corresponding to the @xmath17 x - ray positional uncertainty .",
    "the x - ray completeness limits over @xmath18  90% of the area of the goods fields are similar , with flux limits ( s / n@xmath19 ) of @xmath20  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath22 ( 0.52.0  kev ) and @xmath23  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath22 ( 28  kev ) in the hdf - n field and @xmath24  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath22 ( 0.52.0  kev ) and @xmath25  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath22 ( 28  kev ) in the cdf - s field .",
    "the sensitivity at the aim point is about 2 and 4 times better for the cdf - s and hdf - n , respectively .",
    "given those flux limits , type-1 qsos with @xmath26 are detectable up to @xmath27 , up to an optical - to - x - ray flux ratio @xmath28 .",
    "recently @xcite provide an estimate of @xmath29 statistics ( their table 5 ) : at this optical luminosity they observed a mean value lower than this limit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "conversely , any @xmath31 source in the goods region detected in the x - rays must harbor an agn ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "in addition to the already known qso at @xmath44 @xcite , it brings to two the total number of objects in the redshift range @xmath45 , where our selection criteria are expected to be most complete and reliable .",
    "in order to build up the high - z qso lf from the joint analysis of goods and sdss observations a monte - carlo technique is adopted .",
    "mock qso catalogues in goods and sdss photometric systems are generated , starting from an assumed parameterization of the lf and they are compared to real catalogues using a @xmath46 estimator to quantify the agreement between real data and the functional form of the lf . in order to clone the properties of high - z objects we define a qso template library , tailored using high - quality sdss qso spectra at lower redshift .",
    "we choose the redshift interval @xmath47 , for which the sdss sample had the highest possible level of completeness and the continuum of the qsos was sampled in the largest possible wavelength interval from the @xmath48 emission upward .",
    "the rest - frame spectrum of each selected object blueward of the @xmath48 line is estimated using the continuum fitting technique derived from @xcite .",

    "similar results hold for the goods survey .    in order to estimate the qso lf ,",
    "the approach of @xcite is adopted .",
    "an lf of the form of a double power law is assumed , a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) or a pure density evolution ( pde ) with a power law form and , alternatively , with an exponential form are adopted .",
    "given a value for the break luminosity @xmath53 , the slopes @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the double power law , the normalization @xmath56 , and the redshift evolution parameter @xmath57 , it is possible to calculate the expected number of objects from the lf up to a given magnitude in a given area of the sky .",
    "for each object a value of absolute @xmath58 , a redshift and a template spectrum are extracted .",
    "we then use the template k - correction and colors at the corresponding redshift to simulate the apparent magnitudes in the sdss and acs photometric systems .",
    "the photometric errors in each band are estimated using sdss and goods main photometric catalogues , and added to the simulated magnitudes .",
    "the corresponding color selection criteria are applied to the generated catalogues to obtain mock sdss and goods qso catalogues . in order to limit the statistical error multiple realizations",
    "are considered for each parameter set .",
    "the agreement between real and mock catalogues is evaluated using both a @xmath46 statistic and a kolmogorov - smirnoff test .",

    "[ fon : fig2 ] ( left panel ) .",

    "this result is at variance with @xcite .    in order to understand the origin of this discrepancy",
    "we focus our attention on the completeness of the samples selected using the goods and sdss criteria . to obtain a robust estimate of this quantity",
    "we apply the selection criteria to our template library and analyze the fraction of qsos recovered at various redshifts .",
    "the resulting completeness is shown in figure  [ fon : fig1 ] ( right panel ) . as a comparison @xcite estimated the completeness of their criteria to be well above 90% in the whole range of redshift of interest .",
    "we check that this is related to the fact that the sdss selection criteria are tailored on a qso template spectra whose mean continuum slope @xmath62 is `` bluer '' ( @xmath63 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the mean slope in our template library ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the inferred completeness has a direct consequence on the shape and evolution of the estimated qso lf . assuming the @xcite completeness , the models with a shallow bright - end score higher probabilities with respect to models with a steep bright - end .",
    "we use our best estimate for the lf to compute the qso contribution to the uv background at redshift @xmath0 , following the method outlined by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the qso contribution is insufficient for ionizing the igm at these redshifts .    when compared to physically motivated models ,",
    "the present results show that to reproduce the observations it is necessary to suppress the formation / feeding of low - mass bhs inside dmhs at high redshift . as a consequence",
    "the present estimate of the space density of high - z faint qsos gives strong constraints to models of joint formation and evolution of galaxies and agn . in fig .",
    "[ fon : fig1 ] ( right panel ) we compare the evolution of the qso space density in bin of bolometric luminosity with the predictions of the morgana model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the detailed description of the model is beyond the scope of present proceedings and can be found in that paper ) . in @xcite",
    "we propose that kinetic feedback is the key process responsible for the downsizing of the agn population : in that paper we demonstrate that the velocity dispersion of cold clouds @xmath65 , due to turbulence induced by exploding sne , scales with the star formation time - scale @xmath66 as @xmath67 ; the normalization @xmath68 regulates the level of turbulence , so that a high value ( @xmath69 km s@xmath22 ) induces significant mass loss from small star - forming bulges at high redshift .",
    "different lines in fig .",
    "[ fon : fig1 ] ( right panel ) refer to model with different values for @xmath68 ( see caption for more details ) .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the space density evolution of high - z low - luminosity agn is of fundamental importance to constrain this physical mechanism .",
