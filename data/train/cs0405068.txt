    "event systems ( des ) are systems whose state space is discrete and whose state can only change as a result of asynchronously occurring instantaneous events over time .",
    "such systems have been successfully applied to provide a formal treatment of many man - made systems such as communication systems , networked systems , manufacturing systems , and automated traffic systems .",
    "the behavior of a des is described in terms of the sequences of events involved .",
    "supervisory control of des pioneered by ramadge and wonham @xcite and subsequently extended by many other researchers ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and the bibliographies therein ) provides a framework for designing supervisors for controlling the behavior of des .",
    "usually , a des is described by finite state automaton with events as input alphabets , and the behavior is thus the language accepted by the automaton .",
    "it is worth noting that such a model can only process crisp state transitions . in other words ,",
    "no uncertainty arises in the state transitions of the model .",
    "there are , however , many situations such as mobile robots in an unstructured environment @xcite , intelligent vehicle control @xcite , and wastewater treatment @xcite , in which the state transitions of some systems are always somewhat imprecise , uncertain , and vague .",
    "a convincing example given in @xcite and @xcite is a patient s condition , where the change of the condition from a state , say  excellent \" , to another , say ",
    "fair \" , is obviously imprecise , since it is hard to measure exactly the change .",
    "vagueness , imprecision , and uncertainty are typical features of most of the complex systems .",
    "it is well known that the methodology of fuzzy sets first proposed by zadeh @xcite is a good tool for coping with imprecision , uncertainty , and vagueness . to capture significant uncertainty appearing in states and state transitions of des ,",
    "lin and ying have incorporated fuzzy set theory together with des and thus have extended crisp des to fuzzy des by applying fuzzy finite automaton model @xcite . under the framework of fuzzy des , lin and ying have discussed state - based observability and some optimal control problems .",
    "excitingly , the first application of fuzzy des has recently been reported by ying @xmath0 @xmath1 in @xcite , where fuzzy des are used to handle treatment planning for hiv / aids patients .",
    "it is worth noting that fuzzy finite automata and fuzzy languages have some important applications to many other fields such as clinical monitoring and pattern recognition ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    as a continuation of the works @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we have developed supervisory control theory for fuzzy des modelled by ( maxmin ) fuzzy automata in @xcite .",
    "the behavior of such systems is described by their generated fuzzy languages .",
    "informally , a fuzzy language consists of certain event strings associated with membership grade .",
    "the membership grade of a string can be interpreted as the possibility degree to which the system in its initial state and with the occurrence of events in the string may enter another state .",
    "although strings in a probabilistic language @xcite,@xcite are also endowed with weight , it should be pointed out that fuzzy languages are different from probabilistic languages in semantics : the weight in a fuzzy context describes the membership grade ( namely , uncertainty ) of a string , while the weight of a string in a probabilistic context reflects a frequency of occurrence .",
    "this difference appeals for distinct control action and can also satisfy diverse applications .    for control purposes , the set of events",
    "is partitioned into two disjoint subsets of controllable and uncontrollable events , as usually done in crisp des .",
    "control is exercised by a fuzzy supervisor that disables controllable events with certain degrees in the controlled system , also called a plant , so that the closed - loop system of supervisor and plant exhibits a pre - specified desired fuzzy language .",
    "the controllability of fuzzy languages has been introduced in @xcite as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a fuzzy supervisor that achieves a desired specification for a given fuzzy des .",
    "a similar controllability condition based on different underlying constituents of fuzzy automata and uncontrollable event set has also been given independently by qiu in @xcite .    in @xcite and @xcite , both qiu and",
    "we have restricted our attention to the problem of centralized control under full observation .",
    "there are , however , some systems in which supervisors can not  see \" or  observe \" all the events . for example , in a diagnosis on a disease , if we regard the evolvement of the disease as a system with some physicians as supervisors , it is a fact that the physicians can not see all the events that result in the evolvement of the disease .",
    "unobservability of events arises principally from the limitations of the sensors attached to the systems and the distributed nature of some systems such as manufacturing systems and communication networks where events at some locations are not seen at other locations . for crisp des ,",
    "the issue of partial observation has been extensively studied in both centralized and decentralized control ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however , in terms of fuzzy des , this issue is investigated only as a global property of systems in @xcite ; a further study is desired .    the purpose of this paper is to develop these earlier works @xcite and address the supervisory control problem for fuzzy des with partial observation .",
    "this requires that we have to deal with the presence of unobservable events in addition to the presence of uncontrollable events .",
    "we are mainly concerned with what controlled behavior can be achieved when controlling a fuzzy des with a partially observable fuzzy supervisor and decentralized fuzzy supervisors , respectively .",
    "the contribution of this paper is as follows .    1 ) .",
    "to characterize the class of fuzzy languages achievable under the partially observable architecture , in section iii we introduce the notions of observability and strong observability of fuzzy languages which are generalized versions of observability of crisp languages .",
    "we show that there exists a partially observable fuzzy supervisor synthesizing a desired fuzzy language if and only if the fuzzy language is controllable and observable .",
    "the property that observable fuzzy languages are closed under arbitrary intersections leads to the existence of infimal controllable and observable fuzzy superlanguage .    2 ) .",
    "decentralized supervisory control with global specification has been investigated in section iv . by generalizing co - observability of crisp languages to fuzzy languages ,",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of local fuzzy supervisors that achieve a given legal fuzzy language is derived .",
    "3 ) . in order to obtain an approximation for a given fuzzy language by using controllable and observable sublanguages , normality of fuzzy languages which is stronger than observability",
    "is defined in appendix i. some properties of normal fuzzy languages and the relation between normality , observability , and controllability are also presented .",
    "besides the sections mentioned above , section ii provides the necessary preliminaries ; section v addresses an illustrative example ; section vi concludes the work presented and identifies some future research directions .",
    "the paper also contains two appendices : appendix i is devoted to the normality of fuzzy languages and appendix ii shows the proofs of theorems , propositions , and lemmas .",
    "in the first subsection , we will briefly recall a few basic facts on the supervisory control of crisp des under partial observation . for a detailed introduction to the supervisory control theory",
    ", readers may refer to @xcite .",
    "the second subsection is devoted to the background on the supervisory control of fuzzy des .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the finite set of events , and @xmath3 denote the set of all finite sequences of events , or stings , in @xmath2 , including the empty string @xmath4 .",
    "a string @xmath5 is a prefix of a string @xmath6 if there exists @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath9 .",
    "the length of a string @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "any subset of @xmath3 is called a language over @xmath2 .",
    "the prefix closure of a language @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath13 , consists of the set of strings which are prefixes of strings in @xmath12 .",
    "a language @xmath12 is said to be prefix closed if @xmath14 .    a crisp des , or plant ,",
    "is usually described by a deterministic automaton : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a set of states with the initial state @xmath17 , @xmath2 is a set of events , and @xmath18 is a ( partial ) transition function . the function @xmath19 is extended to @xmath20 in the obvious way . in a logical model of a des , we are interested in the strings of events that the system can generate .",
    "thus the behavior of a des is modelled as a prefix closed language @xmath21 over the event set @xmath2 .",
    "recall that associated with the system is a set @xmath22 of events that can be disabled , and there is a set of events , @xmath23 , that can be observed by partial observation supervisors .",
    "the sets of uncontrollable and unobservable events are denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "now , we are able to introduce the model of fuzzy des",
    ". a fuzzy des is modelled by a fuzzy automaton which is known as maxmin automaton in some mathematical literature @xcite , @xcite and is somewhat different from max - product automata used in @xcite .",
    "a _ fuzzy automaton _ is a four - tuple @xmath106 , where :    * @xmath16 is a crisp ( finite or infinite ) set of states ; * @xmath2 is a finite set of events ; * @xmath107 is the initial state ; * @xmath19 is a function from @xmath108 to @xmath84 $ ] , called a fuzzy transition function .    for any @xmath109 and @xmath31 , we can interpret @xmath110 as the possibility degree to which the automaton in state @xmath111 and with the occurrence of event @xmath112 may enter state @xmath113 .",
    "contrast to crisp des , an event in fuzzy des may take the system to more than one states with different degrees .",
    "the concept of fuzzy automata is a natural generalization of nondeterministic automata .",
    "the major difference between fuzzy automata and nondeterministic automata is : in a nondeterministic automaton , @xmath110 is either @xmath114 or @xmath115 , so the possibility degrees of existing transitions are the same , but if we work with a fuzzy automaton , they may be different .    an _ extended fuzzy transition function _ from @xmath116 to @xmath84 $ ] , denoted by the same notation @xmath19 , can be defined inductively as follows : @xmath117 @xmath118 for all @xmath119 and @xmath31 .",
    "the possibility degrees of transitions here are given by the operation @xmath120 @xmath121 ; this is the main difference between maxmin automata and max - product automata used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further , the language @xmath122 generated by @xmath54 , called _",
    "fuzzy language _ , is defined as a fuzzy subset of @xmath3 and given by @xmath123 this means that a string @xmath10 of @xmath124 is not necessarily either  in the fuzzy language @xmath122 \" or  not in the fuzzy language @xmath122 \" ; rather @xmath10 has a membership grade @xmath125 , which measures its degree of membership in @xmath122 .",
    "if the state set of a fuzzy automaton @xmath54 is empty , then it yields that @xmath126 , i.e. , @xmath127 for all @xmath6 ; otherwise , from the definition we see that @xmath122 has the following properties :    p1 ) @xmath128    p2 ) @xmath129 for any @xmath130    conversely , given a fuzzy language @xmath131 ( over the event set @xmath2 ) satisfying the above properties , we can construct a fuzzy automaton @xmath132 , where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 for all @xmath137 and @xmath31 .",
    "there is no difficulty to verify that @xmath138 .",
    "thus a fuzzy language and a fuzzy des amount to the same thing in our context , which is analogous to the equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata due to kleene @xcite .    note that in the rest of the paper , by a fuzzy language we mean the empty fuzzy language @xmath97 or a fuzzy language that satisfies the above properties p1 ) and p2 ) , unless otherwise specified .",
    "in particular , the supports of such fuzzy languages are prefix closed by the property p2 ) .",
    "we use @xmath139 to denote the set of all fuzzy languages over @xmath2 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath140 .",
    "union and intersection of fuzzy languages can be defined as follows : @xmath141 @xmath142    it has been shown in @xcite that fuzzy languages are closed under arbitrary unions and intersections , respectively .",
    "the concatenation @xmath143 of two fuzzy languages @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which is again a fuzzy language @xcite , is defined by @xmath146 for all @xmath6 .    to model the control action of fuzzy des , we partition the event set @xmath2 into _ controllable _ and _ uncontrollable _ events : @xmath147 , as usually done in crisp des .",
    "however , unlike controllable events in crisp des , a controllable event in fuzzy des can be disabled with any degree .",

    "let us first introduce a fuzzy subset @xmath156 of @xmath3 , which is given by @xmath157    a fuzzy language @xmath158 is said to be _ controllable _ @xcite ( with respect to @xmath122 and @xmath44 ) if @xmath159 or equivalently , @xmath160 for any @xmath30 and @xmath151.[dfcont ]    we remark that a similar concept , called fuzzy controllability condition which is the same as the above when considered for the same underlying constituents of fuzzy automata and uncontrollable event set , has been introduced independently by qiu in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the fuzzy languages @xmath97 and @xmath122 are always controllable with respect to @xmath122 and any @xmath44 .",
    "a good property of controllable fuzzy languages is that they are closed under arbitrary unions and intersections , respectively @xcite .",
    "let @xmath158 be a nonempty fuzzy language .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that there exists a ( fully observable ) fuzzy supervisor @xmath161 for @xmath54 such that @xmath162 if and only if @xmath163 is controllable .",
    "up to this point it has been assumed that all of the events in a fuzzy des can be directly observed by the fuzzy supervisor .",
    "however , in practice we usually only have local or partial observations .    to model a fuzzy des with partial observations",
    ", we bring an additional event set @xmath164 of observable events that can be seen by the fuzzy supervisor , and a natural projection @xmath165 , as usual in crisp des .",
    "more formally , the event set @xmath2 is partitioned into two disjoint subsets : @xmath166 , where @xmath23 and @xmath167 denote the observable event set and the unobservable event set , respectively .",
    "the natural projection @xmath46 is defined in the same way as crisp des , that is , @xmath168 the action of the projection @xmath46 is extended to strings by defining @xmath28 , and @xmath169 .    due to the presence of @xmath46 , the fuzzy supervisor can not distinguish between two strings @xmath170 and @xmath171 that have the same projection , namely , @xmath172 . for such pairs , the fuzzy supervisor will necessarily issue the same control action . to capture this fact , we define a _ partially observable fuzzy supervisor _ as a map @xmath173\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{f}}(e)$ ] satisfying @xmath150 for any @xmath174 $ ] and @xmath151 .",
    "this means that the control action may change unless an observable event occurs .",
    "we shall assume that the control action is instantaneously ( i.e. before any unobservable event occurs ) updated once an observable event occurs .",
    "the assumption is necessary as we may wish to update the control action for some of these unobservable events .    the behavior of @xmath175 when @xmath51 is controlling @xmath54 is defined analogously to the case of full observation .",
    "the fuzzy language @xmath176 generated by @xmath175 is defined inductively as follows :    \\1 ) @xmath177",
    "\\2 ) @xmath178(a)\\wedge{\\mathcal{l}}^{s_p}(s)$ ] for any @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , the possibility of an event @xmath112 following a string @xmath170 under a partially observable fuzzy supervisor only depends on the physically possible degree of @xmath179 in the controlled system , the enabled degree of @xmath112 after the occurrence of @xmath180 , and the physically possible degree of @xmath170 in the closed - loop system .",
    "clearly , @xmath181 and @xmath182 . for simplicity , we sometimes write @xmath131 for @xmath122 .    before introducing the concepts of observability and strong observability from the view of event strings , we remark that based on state estimation ,",
    "lin and ying have already introduced the same terms with different essence to fuzzy des in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have used observability measure to measure the observability of a fuzzy des , which is a good approach to describing the global property of the system . for our purpose",

    "intuitively , for observable fuzzy language , we require that for each controllable event , there is an enabled degree which can be used after seeing the two strings that are the same under the supervisor .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is included in the definition in order for the property of observability not to overlap with the property of controllability . as we will see , observability will only be used in conjunction with controllability , and the latter ensures that the requirements of the definition hold for @xmath151 .    in what follows , ( strong ) observability will always be with respect to @xmath131 , @xmath46 , and @xmath22 ; controllability is with respect to @xmath131 and @xmath44 .",
    "we simply call @xmath163 ( strongly ) observable or controllable if the context is clear . note that we do not make any specific assumptions about the relation between the controllability and observability properties of an event .",
    "thus , an unobservable event could be controllable , an uncontrollable event could be observable , and so forth .    in terms of crisp languages where membership grades are either @xmath114 or @xmath115 , the above observability as well as strong observability",
    "is the same as the observability in @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath131 and @xmath97 are always observable .",
    "it is obvious by definition that the concept of strong observability implies that of observability .",
    "but an observable fuzzy language need not to be strongly observable .",
    "for example , let @xmath188 and @xmath189 one can easily check that @xmath131 is observable , but not strongly observable .    intuitively , a strongly observable fuzzy language @xmath163 allows the associated fuzzy supervisor to take more flexible control action than that of an observable fuzzy language , in order to exactly achieve @xmath163 .",
