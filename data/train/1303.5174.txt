    "collisionless shocks and the associated acceleration of charged particles are among the most important processes in space physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the theory of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) describes quantitatively the acceleration process in the vicinity of shock waves .",
    "it predicts a power - law energy spectrum downstream of the shock , which is a common characteristic of the energetic charged particles observed in space .",
    "however , dsa does not address the physical processes involved with the acceleration of thermal and/or low energy particles which , presumably , constitute the source of the high - energy particles .",
    "this is known as the `` injection problem '' which has received a lot of recent attention but , as yet , there is not a common consensus on its resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "collisionless shocks propagating in magnetized plasmas are usually divided into two classes based on the angle , @xmath0 , between the incident magnetic field vector and shock normal vector .",
    "quasi - parallel shocks are those for which @xmath1 and quasi - perpendicular shocks are for @xmath2 . for quasi - parallel shocks ,",
    "there have been several mechanisms proposed in order to solve the injection problem .",
    "it is usually thought that for parallel shocks alfven waves excited by the streaming of protons can scatter ions in pitch angle .",
    "the particles can be accelerated by dsa when their anisotropy is small enough .",
    "@xcite first proposed a monte carlo model for dsa that includes the injection process , where the injected particles originate from the shock - heated ions downstream of the shock that then leak back upstream of the shock .",
    "subsequently , the particles are `` injected '' into the standard dsa process of scattering back and forth across the shock .",
    "the model assumes that all the particles are scattered by magnetic fluctuations and ignores the details of the shock structure .",
    "it has been used to fit and compare with observations at earth s bow shock @xcite .",
    "similar models have also been discussed by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is usually referred to as the  thermal leakage \" model .",
    "however , a number of authors have found a different scenario for the initial energization at parallel shocks based on self - consistent hybrid simulations @xcite .",
    "they find that the accelerated ions originate from the shock transition layer rather than the downstream region .",
    "some initially thermal ions are accelerated to high energies as they execute cycloidal motion within the electric and magnetic fields in the shock layer .",
    "although the average incident magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal , as the enhanced upstream magnetic fluctuations steepen and convect through the shock layer , the angle between the incident magnetic field and the shock normal right at the shock front can significantly deviate from the average value and even be close to a quasi - perpendicular shock locally ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a particle can gain the first amount of energy by moving against the electric field within the shock layer @xcite .",
    "it has been clearly shown by @xcite that most of the accelerated particles are reflected by the shock and gain the first increment of energy at the shock layer itself .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xcite also used hybrid simulations and found that the leakage of protons dominated the accelerated particles .",
    "we suggest that the reason they obtained a different result from other authors may be due to the method they used to drive shocks . in their simulations ,",
    "the upstream and downstream plasmas are initially connected smoothly by assuming a hyperbolic tangent function for the shock parameters with a thickness of several ion inertial lengths .",
    "the magnetic fluctuations that are important to reflect ions at shock front are ignored at the beginning of the simulation . since the simulation only lasts for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gyrofrequency of protons in the asymptotic upstream magnetic field , it is difficult to determine if the leakage of protons can dominate the accelerated population of particles after the shock is fully developed .",
    "there is observational evidence in support of the idea that particles originate in the shock layer .",
    "for example , signatures of ion reflection at quasi - parallel portion of earth s bow shock has been reported @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that although the initial acceleration in these two processes are quite different , these two models are closely connected and it is difficult to distinguish between them in observations .",
    "the monte carlo model has been explicitly compared with the results of the hybrid simulations .",
    "the comparison generally has a good agreement but some obvious differences @xcite .",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite for a complete review of these two models .",
    "the injection process at quasi - perpendicular shocks is thought to be more complicated .",
    "the required pre - acceleration may be achieved by processes such as shock drift acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and shock surfing acceleration @xcite . in shock drift acceleration ,",
    "charged particles drift because of the gradient in the magnetic field at the shock front .",
    "the direction of the drift is in the same direction as the motional electric field vector @xmath5 , and the particles gain energy during this drift motion . in shock surfing acceleration , it is thought that the cross shock potential electric field is a barrier to some particles incident on the shock leading to their reflection at the shock and a drift against the motional electric field leading to the particle acceleration .",
    "recent progress has been made to distinguish the relative importance for these two processes .",
    "for instance , it has been found that in order for shock surfing acceleration to be efficient , the thickness of the shock layer has to be very thin  on the scale of an electron inertial length @xcite , which is not consistent with the shocks observed in space and in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the shock thickness has to be fairly large compared to electron gyroradii to be consistent with the observation of electron heating at shocks @xcite .",
    "using one - dimensional hybrid simulations , @xcite showed that the reflection by cross shock potential electric field is inefficient for suprathermal particles . @xcite and @xcite have used one - dimensional and two - dimensional full particle simulations with test - particle simulations to show that shock drift acceleration dominates the initial acceleration and shock surfing acceleration can sometimes have a considerable contribution .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that large - scale magnetic turbulence which is present in the background plasma can efficiently lower the injection threshold at perpendicular shocks by increasing the transport of charged particles normal to magnetic field .",
    "recent numerical simulations for the acceleration of charged particles ( both ions and electrons ) in the existence of large - scale magnetic fluctuations show very efficient acceleration , which indicates that there is _ no _ injection problem at perpendicular shocks @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that observationally there seems _ no _ injection problem at quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "for instance , the voyager spacecraft clearly show energetic particles ( at least several @xmath6 ) are accelerated at the solar wind termination shock @xcite .",
    "strong interplanetary shocks observed by ace and wind at @xmath7 au ( mostly quasi - perpendicular shocks ) can accelerate protons to energies more than @xmath8 kev @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that , in order to accurately model the acceleration of charged particles at shocks , one has to consider fully three - dimensional electromagnetic fields .",
    "this is because in a field that has at least one ignorable coordinate , the motions of particles are artificially restricted in the sense that any individual charged particles must remain within one gyroradius of the magnetic field line on which it began its motion @xcite .",
    "many previous hybrid simulations were performed using only one or two spatial dimensions ( scholer et al . , 1993 ) , and , thus , are subject to this constraint .",
    "the effect of cross - field diffusion must be included and requires fully three - dimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "recent two - dimensional and three - dimensional particle - in - cell simulations have shown signatures of energetic particles at parallel shocks but did not examine the initial acceleration process at the shock front @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we employ a three - dimensional self - consistent hybrid simulation to study the initial particle energization at a parallel shock .",
    "we find that all particles accelerated to high energies gain the first amount of energy right at the shock front .",
    "in the three - dimensional simulation , the accelerated protons can move off their original field lines . nevertheless , the initial acceleration process is consistent with that is found in previous one - dimensional and two - dimensional hybrid simulations .",
    "this finding clarifies the acceleration of low energy particles and the injection process for dsa found in other works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "c    we perform three - dimensional hybrid simulations of parallel shocks and compare the results with that of one - dimensional hybrid simulations .",
    "although our simulations resolve the full proton distribution function , we are particularly interested in those particles that are accelerated to high energies . in the hybrid simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ions are treated kinetically and thermal electrons are treated as a massless fluid .",
    "this approach is well suited to resolve ion - scale plasma physics , which is crucial to describe supercritical collisionless shocks and particle acceleration from thermal to suprathermal energies .",
    "we have improved the efficiency of our one - dimensional , two - dimensional , and three - dimensional hybrid simulation models ( section 3.3.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the new codes have been implemented and tested on the nasa s pleiades supercomputer using a few thousand cpu cores .",
    "for the three - dimensional simulations , we consider a three - dimensional cartesian grid ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "all the physical vectors such as the positions and velocities of protons , and electric and magnetic fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 have components in three directions and also spatially depend on @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for the one - dimensional simulations , the physical vectors have components in three directions but only depend on @xmath14 .",

    "the shock front is highly turbulent due to its interaction with upstream fluctuations , which produces various enhancements of magnetic field at different regions .",

    "it clearly shows the reflection of the particle at shock front , and the particle gains energy during the gyromotion . eventually the particle can gain a energy up to @xmath78 and drift several tens of ion inertial lengths away from its original location along the @xmath13 direction",
    "cc +    however , even in the three - dimensional simulation we find that the acceleration process is quite similar to what is found in the one - dimensional simulation",
    ". the particles still gain their first amount of energy at the shock front .",
    "we have examined several hundred accelerated particles in the three - dimensional simulation and found that they all get the initial acceleration right at the shock layer . in figure [ fig8 ] we randomly selected @xmath8 accelerated particles in the three - dimensional simulation and show their positions in the @xmath14 direction as a function of time .",
    "the particles are tracked until they gain energies several times of the plasma ram energy .",
    "this clearly shows that the accelerated particles are originated from the shock layer , _ not _ in the downstream region of the shock .",
    "this is consistent with previous one - dimensional hybrid simulations @xcite .",
    "c    since field lines themselves meander in space , it is difficult to demonstrate that particles move off of field line simply by examining individual trajectories . to address this , in the upper panel of figure [ fig9 ]",

    "this method has been used by @xcite and @xcite to show that in one - dimensional and two - dimensional simulations , the motions of charged particles are restricted .",
    "it can be seen that in the one - dimensional simulation , the distribution of the particles is along a fluctuating field line , meaning that they are restricted on the field line . in the three - dimensional simulation ,",
    "we inject @xmath81 test - particles ( the same number of particles as in the one - dimensional simulation ) at the beginning of the simulation and track their motions during the simulation .",
    "the test - particles are initially evenly distributed along line at @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the @xmath14 direction ( along the same field line ) . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig9 ] , we show the displacements of those particles with energies larger than @xmath79 at @xmath42 similar to the one - dimensional case .",
    "we find that the distribution of the particles has no obvious structure , indicating they move off their original field line . @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that in one - dimensional and two - dimensional numerical simulations , the motions of charged particles are restricted on their original field lines .",
    "here we show that this restriction is indeed removed in the three - dimensional hybrid simulation .",
    "we also observe that some test - particles can move a large distance ( @xmath84 ) transverse to the magnetic field in the three - dimensional simulation .",
    "c    in figure [ fig8 ] we plot the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the transverse displacement from the initial location @xmath85 from the two cases shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "the black solid line represents the results from the three - dimensional simulation and the red dashed line represents the results from the one - dimensional simulation .",
    "the pdfs have been normalized using the counted number of particles .",
    "it can be seen that a significant fraction of the particles can move a large distance ( @xmath84 ) in the transverse direction because the particles can move off their original field line . in the one - dimensional simulation , the transverse motion is restricted within about @xmath86 . in our case the field line meandering due to the large - amplitude magnetic fluctuation can cause some particles to move transverse to the @xmath14 direction .",
    "however , the results for the one - dimensional simulation ( figure [ fig9 ] and figure [ fig10 ] ) are consistent with @xcite , who demonstrated the particles have a restricted cross - field motion in one- and two - dimensional fields by simulating a quasi - perpendicular shock with @xmath87 .    in figure [ fig11-spectra ]",
