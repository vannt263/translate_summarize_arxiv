    "dark matter is a compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "observations from a variety of experiments and physical scales have by now conclusively established the existence of dark matter . although most of the dark matter must be non - relativistic ( or `` cold '' ) to satisfy observations of how structures form in the universe , in the last few years an intriguing evidence for the existence of additional _ relativistic _ degrees of freedom in the early universe has started to accumulate . albeit in no sense is the @xmath0cdm paradigm being conclusively challenged , the question of how new physics could accommodate this extra relativistic degrees of freedom is by all means intriguing .",
    "the planck collaboration has recently reported their accurate measurements of the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the collaboration claimed no evidence for an extra radiation component , which is usually interpreted in terms of the number of relativistic species ( @xmath1 ) at the decoupling of the cmb .",
    "indeed , planck has reported @xmath2 at @xmath3 c.l together with a fairly low value for the expansion rate of the universe today , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been pointed out by the planck collaboration that two recent observations of cepheid variables by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) yielded @xmath5 which is @xmath6 discrepant from the planck value@xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath7 are _ positively _ correlated , a larger value for @xmath7 implies an increase in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the planck collaboration has obtained @xmath8 when the larger value for @xmath7 is incorporated in the planck data .",
    "furthermore , when baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data is taken into account , a similar value of @xmath9 has been found .",
    "it is important to notice that , at present , measurements of @xmath1 are in agreement with each other at the @xmath10 level .",
    "the tension between direct @xmath7 measurements and the cmb and bao data based on the standard @xmath0cdm paradigm can be relieved at the cost of additional neutrino - like species , as explicitly pointed out by the planck collaboration @xcite .",
    "additionally , a recent analysis has been performed pointing to an evidence for dark radiation in the planck data at @xmath3  c.l , if one takes into account at the same time observations of the cmb large angular scale polarization from wmap9 @xcite . besides analyses including planck data , recent studies involving the south pole telescope and atacama telescope find an evidence for @xmath11 when data from different searches are taken into account @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we seek to account for the tentative dark radiation component via partial non - thermal production of dark matter , which has been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite , but just recently has arisen as an interesting scenario to reproduce the measured number of effective neutrinos @xcite . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown with a model independent approach that when a heavy particle decays into a wimp - photon pair ( where wimp indicates a generic weakly interacting massive particle ) , the relativistic state for the non - thermally produced wimps could mimic the effect of one neutrino species at matter - radiation equality while evading big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and structure formation bounds .",
    "recent examples of explicit realizations of the non - thermal , relativistic wimp scenario for the `` dark radiation '' include effective theories as well as a supersymmetric construction and many other models @xcite . here",
    ", we show that such a scenario may also arise with a weak - scale wimp in the context of a non - supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model , an electroweak extension of the standard model ( sm ) featuring a gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "this model is a compelling alternative to the sm with a smoking gun signature given by the presence of charged gauge bosons and scalars , as well as a spectrum of particles whose phenomenological aspects have been investigated extensively @xcite .",
    "this model is also consistent with all electroweak bounds , while offering plausible explanations to many open problems in particle physics , such as dark matter @xcite and the number of particle generations @xcite .    in the 3 - 3 - 1 model we consider here ,",
    "the dark matter particle is dominantly a thermally produced wimp , which arises in the early universe via the standard thermal freeze - out picture , or `` wimp miracle '' .",
    "however , some fraction of the abundance of the dark matter particle has a non - thermal origin due to the decay of a right - handed singlet neutrino , @xmath13 , which decays into wimp - neutrino pairs , similar to the gravitino - sneutrino setup of certain supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "we also comment here on possible constraints on the injection of high energy neutrinos at early stages of the universe @xcite , and show that in our framework this is not a concern .",
    "lastly , we show that the non - thermal production process we invoke within our model is able to simultaneously reproduce the number of effective neutrinos measured by planck and evade bounds from bbn , cmb and structure formation .",
    "this study is organized as follows : in the next section we review the notion that wimps produced in a relativistic state can act effectively as `` dark radiation '' ; in the following section iii we outline the particular particle physics setup we will hone in for the present analysis : the 3 - 3 - 1lhn model ; section iv describes in general how dark radiation is realized in the context of 3 - 3 - 1lhn models , while section v examines in detail the relevant parameter space .",
    "section vi , finally , we summarize and conclude .",
    "in the standard @xmath0cdm picture , dark matter particles are non - relativistic at the time of structure formation . nevertheless ,",
    "if a fraction of the dark matter particles were produced with large enough kinetic energies , they would effectively behave as radiation , with their energy density being redshifted away until matter - radiation equality , i.e. , quite similar to sm neutrinos . in order to determine the fraction and energy density of the non - thermally produced dark matter particles allowed by bbn and structure formation bounds , we remind the reader that at matter - radiation equality the energy density of one neutrino species is equal to @xmath14 of the total dark matter density .",
    "hence , if all the dark matter particles had an increase of @xmath14 in their boost factor , at matter - radiation equality , this would produce the same effect as one additional neutrino species .",
    "of course this scenario where @xmath15 of the dark matter particles are produced relativistically is completely ruled out by structure formation . in other words , structure formation limits the fraction of dark matter particles produced with a large kinetic energy .",
    "concrete examples of this mechanism were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a heavy particle decaying into a wimp - photon pair .",
    "it was shown there that for suitable choices of the lifetime and daughter - to - mother mass ratio , such a mechanism would provide an interesting alternative to explain the currently mild evidence for @xmath16 discussed above .",
    "more interestingly , a setup where some non - thermal production occurs after bbn is also a plausible explanation to why bbn and cmb probes indicate different values for the number of relativistic species ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "if the decay of the mother particle happens at a lifetime much greater than 100 seconds ( bbn epoch ) then no extra radiation would have been present during bbn . however , at the decoupling of the cmb , which happens at @xmath18  sec , some dark radiation could be detected due to the relativistic nature of some fraction of the dark matter particles .",
    "this effect is clearly pointed out in figs .",
    "1 - 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "`` wimpy dark radiation '' is thus a potentially successful explanation to the tentative evidence for additional relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe",
    ". a non - thermal production setup would be devastating for damping the evolution of structures at small scales , having an impact similar to hot dark matter if a significant fraction of the dark matter particles were indeed produced with a large kinetic energy .",
    "quantitatively , it has been shown that in order to be consistent with structure formation bounds , at most roughly @xmath19 of all dark matter particles might have had a non - negligible kinetic energy at matter - radiation equality @xcite",
    ". moreover , bbn bounds are quite stringent as well , imposing limits on the energy released and on the lifetime of the mother particle .",
    "when the particle produced along with the wimp interacts mostly electromagnetically ( such as a photon or electron ) , it has been concluded that for lifetimes shorter than @xmath20  seconds , bbn bounds are evaded and structure formation limits are circumvented as long as at most @xmath19 of the dark matter particles are produced with large kinetic energies ( see fig .  1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "turning again our attention to the relation between the non - thermal production of dark matter particles and the number of effective neutrinos . in this work",
    "we will derive this relation following closely the procedure in ref .",

    "( [ deltaneff2 ] ) does not depend on the nature of the particles involved and therefore it is valid for any decay mode , as long as the mass of the mother particle is significantly heavier than the mass of the decay products , and of the stable wimp in particular .",
    "therefore , in principle , any particle physics model that contains a long lived particle decaying into dark matter particles after wimp freeze - out might induce @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ deltaneff2 ] ) shows that if @xmath19 of the whole dark matter of the universe was produced by the decay of a heavy particle with a lifetime equal or shorter than @xmath40  sec one needs to have a mass , for the heavy mother particle such that @xmath41 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this implies , in particular , that in order to explain the planck result of @xmath42 when including the direct measurements of @xmath7 from hst , we need @xmath43 . in other words , the mother particle must be _ significantly heavier _ than its decay products .",
    "it is worth reiterating that , in this framework , the majority of the dark matter particles would still have to be produced as cold , i.e. non - relativistic particles , presumably with a thermal cross section at the electroweak scale providing the right thermal relic abundance .",
    "our goal here is to investigate if this scenario is feasible in a well - motivated electroweak gauge group extension of the sm named 3 - 3 - 1lhn which we briefly introduce below .",

    "concerning right - handed quarks , they are all singlets , with hyper - charges exactly equal to their electric charges . notice that the three quarks ( @xmath54 ) shown above are new quarks added to the standard model .",
    "three triplets of scalars , @xmath55 , are necessary to induce the proper pattern of symmetry breaking after they develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) different from zero , @xmath56 and then generate , at tree level , masses for all massive particles in the model . besides the standard gauge bosons , @xmath57 and the photon , the model contains five new gauge bosons indicated as @xmath58 , @xmath59 and a @xmath60 from the enlarged gauge group .",
