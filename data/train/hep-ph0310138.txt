    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , as well known , is one of the solid pillars of the standard cosmological model .",
    "the theory predicts that relevant abundances of light elements , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , have been produced during the first minutes of the evolution of the universe .",
    "the predictions span about 9 orders of magnitude and are in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "theoretical calculations are well defined and very precise .",
    "the largest uncertainty arises from the values of cross - sections of the relevant nuclear reactions .",
    "theoretical accuracy is at the level of 0.2% for @xmath2 , 5% for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and 15% for @xmath3 .",
    "however , comparison of theoretical results with observational data is not straightforward because the data are subject to poorly known evolutionary effects and systematic errors .",
    "still , even with these uncertainties , bbn permits to constraint important cosmological parameters and to eliminate many modifications of the standard model , thus allowing to derive restrictions on the properties of elementary particles and , in particular , of neutrinos .    in this paper , we briefly review the physics of bbn . in sect .",
    "[ bbn - phys ] we introduce the essential parameters and inputs . in sect .",
    "[ obs ] we summarize the present situation of observational data . in sect .",
    "[ param ] we discuss the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "the last section is dedicated to bbn bounds on non - standard neutrinos and , specifically , to bbn and neutrino oscillations .",
    "to understand primordial nucleosynthesis , we must follow in detail the histories of nucleons in the early universe .",
    "this is usually done by using numerical codes ( among which the fortran code by wagoner @xcite , updated by kawano @xcite has become a standard tool ) .",
    "however , the main features of big - bang nucleosynthesis can be obtained by simple analytic arguments described in this section ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis occurs at temperatures @xmath4 mev , which are small with respect to nucleon masses . at these temperatures ,",
    "the number of nucleons is simply equal to the initial baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it is useful to describe this quantity in terms of the _ present _ baryon to photon ratio : @xmath5 the parameter @xmath6 is simply related to the baryon density of the universe , being @xmath7 .",
    "the neutron to proton ratio is controlled by the weak processes @xmath8 which interconvert neutron and proton .",
    "when the temperature @xmath9 of the universe is about 1 mev , these reactions are fast enough to maintain neutron and proton in chemical equilibrium . the neutron abundance is thus given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 mev is the neutron - proton mass difference and @xmath12 is the dimensionless chemical potential of electron neutrinos ( in standard bbn @xmath13 is assumed to be negligible ) .",
    "when the temperature @xmath9 drops below @xmath14 mev , the neutron - proton inter - conversion rate , @xmath15 , becomes smaller than the expansion rate the universe , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 counts the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom of the early universe .",
    "the deviation of @xmath17 from the standard value , @xmath18 , is usually described in terms of an _ equivalent _ number of massless neutrinos @xmath19 according to : @xmath20    for temperatures @xmath21 , chemical equilibrium can no longer be maintained .",
    "the neutron abundance @xmath22 evolves only due to neutron decay , according to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the neutron lifetime .",
    "one should note that the `` freeze - out '' temperature @xmath25 scales as @xmath26 and thus is sensitive to the particle content of the early universe .",
    "the larger is @xmath17 ( or equivalently @xmath27 ) , the earlier is the freeze - out of the neutron abundance , at an higher value , and hence , the larger is the @xmath2 abundance produced in bbn .",
    "when the temperature of the universe is equal to @xmath28  mev neutrons and protons start to react each other to build up light nuclei .",
    "the exact value of @xmath29 depends on the baryon to photon ratio @xmath6 .",
    "only two body reaction are indeed important in bbn , such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "deuterium must be produced in appreciable quantity before the other reactions can proceed at all .",
    "however , due to the large number of photons per baryon , photodissociation of deuterium is not suppressed until the temperature decreases well below the deuterium binding energy @xmath33mev . following @xcite , one can see that the temperature @xmath29 below which deuterium production is favoured scales as @xmath34 .",
    "once deuterium is formed , nucleosynthesis begins and light nuclei are produced rapidly .",
    "essentially all available nucleons are quickly bound into @xmath2 , which is the most tightly bound light nuclear species .",
    "in addition to @xmath2 , substantial amounts of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are produced .",
    "no heavy elements ( @xmath35 ) are produced , due both to the fact that coulomb - barrier suppression is very significant and to the absence of stable isotopes with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in fig.1",
    "we show the light element abundances produced during bbn , as calculated by using the kawano code @xcite , for @xmath6 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath40he abundance includes small corrections due to radiative processes at zero and finite temperature , non - equilibrium neutrino heating during @xmath41 annihilation , and finite nucleon mass effects @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions are affected by uncertainties at the level of 0.2% for @xmath2 , 5% for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and 15% for @xmath3 .",
    "these uncertainties are due to uncertainties in the weak rates ( which are `` normalized '' to the measured neutron lifetime @xmath42 , see @xcite for details ) and in the values of the relevant nuclear reaction rates .",
    "they have been estimated by montecarlo or semi - analytical methods @xcite .",
    "recently the nuclear data have been re - analyzed , leading to improved precision in the abundance predictions @xcite .",
    "the abundances of light elements synthesized in the big bang have been subsequently modified through chemical evolution of the astrophysical environments where they are measured .",
    "the observational strategy is to identify sites which have undergone as little chemical processing as possible and rely on empirical methods to infer the primordial abundances .",
    "for example , measurements of deuterium are made in in quasar absorption line systems ( qas ) at high redshift ; if there is a `` ceiling '' to the abundance in different qas then it can be assumed to be the primordial value .",
    "the @xmath43 abundance is measured h ii regions in blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) which have undergone very little star formation .",
    "its primordial value is inferred either by using the associated nitrogen or oxygen abundance to track the stellar production of helium , or by simply observing the most metal - poor objects .",
    "closer to home , the observed uniform abundance of @xmath3 in the hottest and most metal poor pop ii stars in our galaxy is believed to reflect its primordial value .",
    "( we do not consider @xmath1 whose post - bbn evolution is more complex . )",
    "as observational methods have become more sophisticated , the situation has become more , instead of less , complex .",
    "relevant discrepancies , of a systematic nature , have emerged between different observers . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief summary of the present situation for deuterium and helium-4 ( looking from outside by a non - expert ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more complete and up - to - date discussion .",
    "_ deuterium _ + post - bbn evolution of deuterium ( d ) is simple .",
    "deuterium is burnt in stars producing @xmath1 .",
    "any deuterium measurement provides thus a lower limit for the primordial d abundance and an upper limit for baryon density of the universe .    in recent years",
    ", measurements of deuterium have been made in quasar absorption line systems ( qas ) at high redshift .",
    "these systems are presumably not contaminated by stellar processes and thus the observed deuterium should be close to the primordial one .",
    "since deuterium isotope shift corresponds to velocity of only @xmath44 , clearly qas with simple velocity structure are needed for reliable determinations .",
    "moreover , ionization corrections , possible `` interlooper '' etc . further increase systematic uncertainties .    in tab .",
    "[ deuterium ] we give the results of recent deuterium determinations in qas @xcite .",
    "an estimate of primordial deuterium abundance can be obtained from the weighted mean of data in tab .",
    "[ deuterium ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the dispersion among the different determinations is not consistent with errors in the single measurements ( see  @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "we will use , in the following , the value @xmath45 given in @xcite , which is the weighted mean of the log  d / h values given by @xcite .",
    "the quoted error is the 1@xmath46 error in the mean , given by the standard deviation of the five log d / h values divided by @xmath47 .",
    "this error is used instead of the usual error in the weighted mean , in order to take into account the `` anomalous '' dispersion of deuterium data .",
    ".deuterium abundance in quasar absorption line systems at high red - shift ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath48 this system was first analyzed by @xcite with the result @xmath49 .",
    "the quoted value is from @xcite .",
    "[ deuterium ]    _ helium-4 _ + as a result of stellar processing , @xmath50 is produced , increasing its abundance above the primordial value , together with `` metals '' , such as nitrogen , oxygen and other elements heavier than @xmath50 , which are not produced in bbn .",
    "the observed @xmath50 abundance provides thus an upper bound to the primordial one , @xmath51 .",
    "helium observations are done in h ii regions in blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) which have undergone very little star formation ( at present @xmath52 h ii regions have been studied for their helium content ) . in order to infer the primordial value @xmath51 ,",
    "one extrapolates to zero metallicity ( @xmath53 ) the observed relation between helium ( @xmath54 ) and metals ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is usually done using by nitrogen ( @xmath56 ) or oxygen ( @xmath57 ) as metallicity tracers .",
    "alternatively , one can simply average helium abundances in most metal poor objects .",
    "the present situation is that independent determinations of @xmath51 have a statistical errors at the level of @xmath58 but differ among each others by about @xmath59 . in particular , by using independent data sets , olive and steigman  @xcite and olive et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained @xmath60 , while izotov et al .",
    "@xcite and izotov and thuan  @xcite have found @xmath61 .",
    "the discrepancy between different determinations is possibly related to different description of the complex physical processes acting in h ii regions .",
    "several sources of systematic uncertainties may , in fact , affect the helium determination at a level comparable or larger than the reported statistical errors , like e.g. the evaluation of the ionization correction factor ( which is related to how much neutral helium is in the object under scrutiny ) , of the temperature correction factor , of underlying stellar absorption , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) .    as discussed in the next section ,",
    "it is extremely important to have a better determination of the @xmath2 primordial abundances and a reliable estimate of the total ( statistical + systematic ) associated error . for our estimates",
    ", we will use the central values for @xmath51 reported above ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , and the error estimate @xmath64 , which is obtained e.g. in @xcite from the dispersion of the various @xmath51 determinations .",
    "the deuterium abundance @xmath45 can be used to determine the baryon density of the universe . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the quoted value corresponds to @xmath65 ( in standard bbn ) or , equivalently , to @xmath66 .",
    "the error budget is dominated by the observational uncertainties which are about a factor 3 larger than uncertainties in theoretical prediction .",
    "the obtained value for @xmath67 has to be compared with independent determination of the baryon density of the universe . in particular with the result @xmath68 given in @xcite which is obtained from a combined fit to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) data .",
    "the agreement of these two independent determinations is extremely important because they rely on completely different physical phenomena ( which occurred at different time during the evolution of the universe ) .",
    "we note that cmb ( and lss ) are presently more accurate than bbn in determining the baryon density of the universe .",
    "the value of @xmath6 deduced from deuterium can be used , in standard bbn , to predict the abundance of the other elements and to compare with observations .",
    "following @xcite , one obtains @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is evident that there is tension between the quoted values and the observational results .",
    "the `` predicted '' abundance for @xmath2 is higher than the `` high '' helium value of izotov et al .",
    "moreover , the `` predicted '' @xmath3 abundance is a factor 2 - 3 larger with respect to the present observational results @xcite .",
    "the origin of these differences has to be clarified .",
    "they could be due to systematic errors in the measurements or to evolutionary effects ( e.g. @xmath3 depletion ) or they could be a real indication for non - standard effects in bbn .    in particular , the present d and @xmath2 data seems to favour an equivalent number of neutrino families @xmath72 . in order to understand the present situation , it is useful to combine the deuterium value @xmath73 , with the `` low '' helium abundance , @xmath74 , or with the `` high '' helium abundance , @xmath75 .",
    "the error @xmath76 is the `` estimated '' systematic error in @xmath2 measurements ( see above ) . if we fit these data in the plane @xmath77 following @xcite , we obtain the bound @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) in the first case , and @xmath80 ( @xmath79 ) in the second . in both cases ,",
    "the central values are below three , even if the errors are large enough to allow for the standard value @xmath81 .",
    "the described results clearly indicate that a large number of effective neutrinos is disfavoured .",
    "one can conclude , in principle , that an upper bound on the number of _ extra _ neutrinos , @xmath82 , is @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear , however , that the situation is quite delicate .",
    "the error @xmath84 is completely dominated by systematic error in @xmath2 measurements . for this reason , we believe that , at present stage , a more safe upper bound on the number of extra neutrinos is @xmath85 . hopefully in the near future we will be able to derive a stronger limit .",
    "other physical parameters which can be bounded by bbn are the chemical potentials of different neutrino species , @xmath86 where @xmath87 . the possible role of neutrino degeneracy in bbn was noted already in @xcite and then discussed in a number of papers . a non vanishing chemical potential for @xmath88 , @xmath89 or @xmath90 would increase the neutrino contribution to the energy density and can be described as an increase in @xmath27 . an additional ( and dominant ) effect exists for electron neutrinos which directly participate to n - p interconversion reactions .",
    "a non vanishing @xmath91 would shift the equilibrium between neutrons and protons , see eq .",
    "( [ np - eq ] ) , with large effects on light elements production .    several analysis have been made of the bbn limits on neutrino chemical potentials . a recent analysis which include also cmb data",
    "@xcite concludes : @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the dimensionless chemical potentials . for further implications and for a discussion of the case in which both @xmath27 and @xmath13 are free to vary see @xcite .",
    "effects of neutrino oscillations on bbn are much different if only active neutrinos are mixed , if only one active and one sterile neutrino are mixed or if we consider the more `` complete '' case of mixing between three active and one sterile neutrino",
    ".      if neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium with vanishing chemical potentials , mixing between active neutrinos does not introduce any deviation from standard bbn results .",
    "the situation is more interesting if neutrinos are degenerate . in particular , it was shown recently @xcite that , for the mixing parameters which explain the solar neutrino problem @xcite ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , asymmetries in the muonic and/or tauonic neutrino sectors would produce , through oscillations , an asymmetry into the electronic neutrino sector .",
    "this means that , in presence of oscillations , the restrictive bounds on the chemical potential of electron neutrinos applies to all neutrino flavours .",
    "it is thus possible to obtain the restrictive bound : @xmath98 valid for any flavour @xcite .",
    "there are three possible effects on bbn created by mixing between active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "first is the production of additional neutrino species in the primeval plasma , leading to @xmath99 .",
    "the second effect is a depletion of the number density of electronic neutrinos which results in a higher neutron freezing temperature .",
    "both these effects lead to a larger neutron - to - proton ratio and to more abundant production of primordial deuterium and helium-4 ( for the details see e.g. review  @xcite ) .",
    "if mixing between active neutrinos is absent the second effect would manifest itself only in the case of @xmath100-mixing , if we neglect relatively weak depopulation of @xmath101 through the annihilation @xmath102 .",
    "the third effect is a generation of large lepton asymmetry due to oscillations between active and sterile species  @xcite .",
    "however , this effect takes place only for very weak mixing , much smaller than the experimental bound and is not discussed in this paper .",
    "the problem of active - sterile neutrino oscillation is quite complex and has been discussed in many papers starting from 1990 ( a large list of references can be found in ref .",
    "the problem was recently re - considered in @xcite both analytically and by solution of the complete system of integro - differential kinetic equations .",
    "earlier derived bounds have been re - analyzed and significantly different results have been found in the resonance case .    the results of @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . the effect on bbn",
    "is expressed in term of variation of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath103 .",
    "the upper panels are for the case of @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) mixing , while the lower panels refer to the case of @xmath106 mixing .",
    "the obtained results clearly depend on the sign of the mass differences . for positive",
    "is positive if sterile neutrino is heavier than active neutrino , in the limit @xmath107 . ]",
    "mass differences , @xmath108 ( left panels ) , sterile neutrino production occurs through non - resonant transitions . for @xmath109 ( right panels )",
    ", one has instead resonant active - sterile transitions which result in much stronger bounds on the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the solid lines in fig.[f2 ] correspond to numerical results , while the red dotted lines corresponds to analytic approximate results .",
    "it is evident that an observational bound on extra neutrinos much better than unity , say @xmath110 , could give very restrictive limits on active - sterile neutrino mixing .",
    "unfortunately , the present observational bound @xmath111 is not accurate enough to put relevant constraints .",
    "it is practically established now that all active neutrinos are mixed with parameters given by the large mixing angle solution to solar neutrino problem ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) and by atmospheric neutrino data ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "existence of fast transitions between @xmath101 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 may noticeably change bbn bounds on mixing with sterile neutrinos , expecially for small values of mass difference .",
    "in particular , due to oscillations between active neutrinos , a deficit of @xmath112 or @xmath113 would be efficiently transformed into a deficit of @xmath101 , leading to stronger bounds on active - sterile mixing .",
    "the effects of mixing between active neutrinos on the bbn bounds on a possible active - sterile admixture has been investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "comparison of bbn theoretical results with observational data is not straightforward because the data are subject to poorly known evolutionary effects and systematic errors .",
    "still , even with these uncertainties , bbn permits to constraint important cosmological parameters , like e.g. the baryon density @xmath114 , the effective number neutrino families @xmath27 , the neutrino degeneracy parameters @xmath115 etc .",
    "the present bound on the number of extra neutrinos species @xmath116 is about unity and is not accurate enough to put relevant constraints on active - sterile neutrino mixing .",
    "if this limit could be reduced in the next future , say to @xmath110 , very restrictive limits on active - sterile admixture could be obtained .",
