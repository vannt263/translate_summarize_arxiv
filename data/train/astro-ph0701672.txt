    "the reionization and heating history of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has not yet been fully understood . in particular",
    ", the nature of the sources of these processes is mostly unclear .",
    "an important contribution might arise from the first stars ; but other more exotic sources ( e.g. intermediate mass black holes , decaying dark matter particles , etc . )",
    "have been proposed as well.@xcite in this proceeding , we focus on the possible role of dark matter ( dm ) decays and annihilations on reionization and heating of the igm .",
    "the rate of energy released by dm decays / annihilations and absorbed ( per baryon ) by the igm can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fraction of energy absorbed by the igm , @xmath3 is the mass of the dm particle and @xmath4 is the decrease rate of the number of dm particles per baryon .",
    "the expression of @xmath4 depends on the density of dm particles and on the decays lifetime or on the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section , in the case of decays and annihilations , respectively.@xcite    the most crucial parameter in equation  ( [ eq : fabs ] ) is @xmath2 .",
    "previous studies@xcite assumed a complete and immediate energy absorption by the igm ( i.e. @xmath5 ) , deriving upper limits to the effects of dm on reionization and heating .",
    "annihilating heavy dm particles ( @xmath6 gev ) have no effects on such processes , even assuming @xmath5 , because of the very small allowed interacting rate . instead",
    ", under the assumption of complete absorption , lighter particles ( @xmath7100 mev ) could be important sources of partial early reionization and heating@xcite .",
    "@xmath2 can be hardly calculated in the case of heavy particles ( @xmath8100  mev ) , because of the uncertainties in modeling the cascade associated with massive product particles . ] . on the other hand , for relatively light ( @xmath9 mev ) dm candidates",
    "it is possible to derive the correct behaviour of the absorbed fraction@xcite @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , the possible decay / annihilation products of these light particles are only photons , electron - positron pairs , or neutrinos ( which are assumed to have negligible interactions with matter ) . for photons the effects of compton scattering and photo - ionization must be considered ; for pairs , the relevant processes are inverse compton scattering , collisional ionizations , and positron annihilations .    if the decay products are both photons and pairs , @xmath2 is found to be high at early epochs ( @xmath10 ) , when photo - ionization ( considering photons ) and inverse compton scattering or / and positron annihilations ( considering pairs ) are efficient processes . in both cases , @xmath2 drops at lower redshifts . as an example , in fig .  1 we show the behaviour of @xmath2 in the case of sterile neutrinos which decay into photons ( left panel ) and light dark matter ( ldm ) particles which annihilate producing pairs ( right panel ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for decaying ldm particles@xcite .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    [ fig : fig1 ]",
    "we can now calculate how the behaviour of @xmath2 affects the impact of dm decays / annihilations on reionization and heating@xcite . as an example , in fig .",
    "2 we again consider the case of sterile neutrinos decaying into photons ( left panel ) and of ldm particles annihilating into pairs ( right panel ) . the thin and thick lines in both panels refer to the case where we assume complete absorption and to the case in which @xmath2 is the same as shown in fig .  1 , respectively .",
    "the effect of sterile neutrino decays on reionization and heating is strongly suppressed , if we consider the correct @xmath2 .",
    "a similar result can be found for ldm decays@xcite .",
    "also in the case of ldm annihilations this suppression is apparent , even if less dramatic .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]    in summary , we can conclude that the correct calculation of @xmath11 is crucial@xcite : if the correct values of @xmath2 are taken into account , the impact of dm decays and annihilations on reionization and heating is almost negligible , a factor @xmath12 to 1000 lower than previous estimates based on the hypothesis of complete and immediate absorption .",
