    "quantum fields in curved spacetime have been the source of many interesting surprises and useful theoretical insight .",
    "many investigations of quantum dynamics in curved backgrounds have focussed on fields in spacetimes with non - trivial causal structure , such as black holes or cosmological backgrounds .",
    "nevertheless , it is also interesting to consider fields in causally trivial backgrounds , with the hope of gaining not only some insights into the response of the field theory to background curvature , but also to ascertain the non - trivial constraints imposed by the background on the quantum dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on an important example of this type , the dynamics of conformally invariant quantum field theories ( cfts ) on global anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetime .",
    "the interest in this background is manifold .",
    "for one , ads is a conformally flat geometry and is a maximally symmetric spacetime . recall that in @xmath3 dimensions , has as its isometry group @xmath4 .",
    "this isometry algebra is as large as the poincar algebra , and this makes a natural arena for investigating the behaviour of @xmath3-dimensional cfts ; the latter have a global @xmath5 symmetry which includes the ads isometries .",
    "the ads geometry is not globally hyperbolic , and in fact has a time - like future null infinity @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that one has to prescribe boundary conditions in order to completely specify any dynamical system on this background , be it classical or quantum .",
    "in particular , this fact allows one to investigate in a covariant manner the effect of boundary conditions on the dynamics of cfts .",
    "in fact , in the early days of supergravity it was realized that there are interesting boundary conditions that can play a role in the dynamics of fields in ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "the interest in those days was in understanding gauged supergravity theories ; our main consideration is for quantum dynamics of cfts on a fixed ( non - dynamical ) ads background .",
    "it was also realized in @xcite that the ads spacetime provides a geometric and uniquely symmetric ( by virtue of its maximal symmetry ) infra - red cut - off which makes it useful to study dynamics of field theories which require an infra - red regulator .",
    "the discussion of @xcite was incomplete in that it did not account for the most general set of boundary conditions available , which as we shall see play a rather crucial role in the dynamics .",
    "of particular interest to us will be the dynamics of strongly coupled conformal gauge theories in ads backgrounds .",
    "this has two important physical applications , which we now describe .",
    "let us first consider the case where we have a strongly coupled cft on whose dynamics we understand , and then turn on the gravitational interaction weakly .",
    "it is a well known fact that any consistent gravitational theory on ads spacetime has a dual holographic avatar from the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "specifically , if it can be embedded into a consistent background , the dynamics of weak gravity together with the strongly coupled cft on the background , can be described by a dual cft@xmath7 which lives on a space isomorphic to the boundary of . usually in the context of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the couplings of the matter ( cft@xmath8 ) degrees of freedom are commensurate with the gravitational coupling .",
    "there is however no reason not to have a hierarchical separation of the couplings , and the models we focus on correspond to the extreme limit where gravitational interactions have been switched off ( which is always a consistent setup in itself ) . understanding the dual field theory",
    "as we slowly turn on the gravitational interaction can provide interesting insights into the ads / cft correspondence and into the dynamics of field theories in ads .    on the other hand , one can start with a @xmath3-dimensional conformal field theory which is known to have a holographic dual in terms of gravity in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "consider for instance the well known duality between @xmath9 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) in four dimensions and type iib string theory on @xmath10 .",
    "one can consider the dynamics of @xmath11 sym on any background geometry ; in particular is an appropriate ( and for reasons mentioned earlier a particularly interesting ) candidate . to understand the holographic dual of @xmath12 sym on one would need to construct asymptotically locally @xmath10 geometries whose boundary is . while a class of such geometries is easy to construct , using the fact that can be written in an foliation , it turns out that the precise answer is much more subtle than naively anticipated .    to appreciate the subtlety",
    "let us return to the issue of boundary conditions to which we have previously alluded .",
    "if there was a unique choice of boundary conditions for the @xmath0 sym fields on , then one would indeed be tempted to look for `` the holographic dual '' of this system in terms of the aforementioned foliations of .",
    "however , the choice of available boundary conditions is quite rich and large , and different boundary conditions lead to different theories and different gravitational duals , lending this system much of its intricacy .",
    "it therefore behooves us to understand both the choices of available boundary conditions and their implications for the dynamics of the system .    the richness accorded by the boundary conditions",
    "can be understood by recalling that for scalar fields in in a certain mass range , close to the breitenlohner - freedman bound , one is allowed two distinct choices of local boundary conditions that are linear in the field and consistent with the ads symmetries . in the ads / cft context , these two choices lead to different dual conformal field theories .",
    "this fact was already appreciated in the seminal work of breitenlohner and freedman @xcite , and was clarified in the ads / cft context in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it turns out that one can also pick from a choice of boundary conditions for massless vector fields in @xcite ; this was used to understand the s - duality transformation properties of abelian gauge fields in in @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion was subsequently provided in @xcite , based on the linearized analysis of @xcite . since almost all",
    "known conformal theories in four spacetime dimensions are gauge theories , these general boundary conditions are of relevance in the study of interacting cfts on backgrounds .    focussing on gauge theories in four dimensions , it transpires that one can impose at least two distinct boundary conditions which we call dirichlet / standard / electric or neumann / modified / magnetic , respectively @xcite .",
    "for the dirichlet choice , one fixes the boundary value of the gauge field , while with the neumann boundary condition , it is the normal component of the field strength to the boundary that gets fixed . for an abelian gauge theory in ads these two boundary conditions are s - dual @xcite .",
    "however , for non - abelian theories , despite this innocuous sounding distinction , these two boundary conditions operate quite differently . a crucial difference between the two choices",
    "is that with the dirichlet boundary conditions , one is allowed to consider electrically charged states in the ads geometry ; the flux lines from the charge simply go off to the boundary .",
    "however , with the neumann boundary conditions , one has a gauss law constraint operating on the charged states ; electrically charged states are forbidden , and instead one is allowed magnetically charged states .",
    "a key point is that in perturbation theory , one usually has light electric states , but heavy magnetic states .",
    "this implies that for weakly coupled field theories , one should expect to see only a few light degrees of freedom for neumann boundary conditions . for weakly coupled field theories with large gauge groups ,",
    "the distinction between the two boundary conditions is thus quite striking : for the dirichlet boundary conditions one has @xmath13 light states for a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath14 , , @xmath15 etc . , and the corresponding lie algebra in lower - case gothic font , @xmath16 etc .. ] while the neumann boundary conditions only allow @xmath17 light states .",
    "if the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions were to be exchanged under s - duality , as in the abelian theory , then one would have an interesting scenario . for , starting with the dirichlet boundary conditions for the gauge theory , with @xmath18 , one would have a large number of electric states , which under the s - duality map would morph into a few magnetic states due to the neumann boundary condition .",
    "of course , this statement involves an unjustified extrapolation from weak coupling to strong coupling , and it is also suspicious since a pure gauge theory does not have s - duality ; one would need to consider a gauge theory with additional matter degrees of freedom , such as for instance the @xmath9 sym , which does exhibit s - duality . in this case one",
    "has to worry about the boundary conditions on the matter fields as well , in order to make any statements about s - duality and exchange of boundary conditions . in any case , as we shall review below , the dirichlet and neumann boundary condition are not s - dual in non - abelian gauge theories , thereby providing a simple resolution to the disparity in the low energy spectrum .    before getting to the issue of the s - duals of various boundary conditions , it is also worthwhile to pause to ask whether one can use the holographic gauge / gravity correspondence to study field theories on backgrounds . for superconformal field theories such as @xmath19 sym ,",
    "the answer must clearly be yes , since we know that the theory on @xmath20 or on @xmath21 does indeed have a holographic dual in terms of type iib string theory on @xmath22 .",
    "in general one can consider the cft on any curved manifold @xmath23 , which then requires that the bulk spacetime includes an asymptotically locally ads geometry @xmath24 whose boundary is in the same conformal class as @xmath23 . the simplest such geometries which one can write down are foliations of ( used for instance in the brane - world context in @xcite , see ) .",
    "there is however an interesting puzzle associated with the dirichlet boundary conditions for large @xmath1 gauge theories from the gravity viewpoint .",
    "we know that the free theory with dirichlet boundary conditions has a large number of light excitations , since the electrically charged adjoint fields of @xmath14 are admissible operators for these boundary conditions . if these states remained light as we increased the t hooft coupling constant of the theory , then one expects that the holographic dual of @xmath9 sym at strong coupling will correspond to a geometry with @xmath25 states .",
    "note that these states should live in all of ads and not just in the interior as in black hole backgrounds ; for instance , with these boundary conditions the group @xmath14 is a global symmetry , and there should be @xmath26 gauge fields in the bulk whose boundary conditions determine the sources for the global symmetry currents . in the large @xmath1 limit this bulk gauge group is strongly coupled ( at least in the limit of large @xmath27 where one expects the holographic dual to be under control ) , so it seems unlikely that any weakly coupled description of the bulk physics exists for these boundary conditions ( unless there is some phase transition at a finite value of the t hooft coupling in which almost all the light states disappear ) ; the naive holographic dual mentioned above can not be valid .",
    "it turns out that in order to understand the strongly coupled theory in light of both the issues with s - duality and the puzzles associated with the holographic description , one has to go back to the drawing board and carefully disentangle the way the boundary conditions are imposed . for a theory like @xmath9",
    "sym one has a large number of boundary conditions that can be imposed on the boundary of , and not all of them are expected to be tractable .",
    "we need to identify those that can be followed from weak to strong coupling , using either the electromagnetic s - duality of the theory or holographic methods .",
    "the class of boundary conditions which best lend themselves to such an analysis are the supersymmetric boundary conditions preserving sixteen supercharges .",
    "it turns out that there is a vast number of such boundary conditions .",
    "fortunately , these have been discussed in detail for a closely related problem by gaiotto and witten @xcite , who have also described the role of s - duality for these same boundary conditions in @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite was for the field theory on the half - space @xmath28 , which can be realized by d3-branes ending on other branes , but this geometry is conformal to ; we will exploit this feature to port the results of @xcite to the situation at hand . as we will discuss , the choice of a boundary condition for the theory on the half - space maps to a choice of supersymmetric vacuum for the theory on .",
    "one main feature of the supersymmetric boundary conditions for @xmath19 sym on with @xmath29 is that the simplest dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are no longer s - dual to each other @xcite .",
    "in fact , the s - dual of the simplest neumann boundary condition does involve a dirichlet - type boundary condition , but it is one in which the gauge group @xmath14 turns out to be broken completely .",
    "this is easy to understand in the d - brane language : the neumann boundary conditions may be realized by requiring @xmath1 d3-branes to end on a single ns5-brane ( which can not accept fundamental string charge , and so forces the total electric charge on the d3-branes to vanish ) .",
    "thus , the s - dual involves d3-branes ending on a single d5-brane .",
    "but since the world - volume flux on a single d5-brane is abelian , it is not possible for a non - abelian configuration of d3-branes to end on a single d5-brane . rather , one must ` higgs ' the d3-brane world - volume theory appropriately so that its gauge group is completely broken .",
    "these boundary conditions are obtained by prescribing a class of allowed singularities for the scalars of @xmath30 sym on the boundary of the half - space , which break the gauge symmetry , and via a conformal transformation lead to vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for the scalars on , and thus to masses ( and modified conformal weights ) for the corresponding gauge fields in .",
    "the simplest dirichlet boundary condition for @xmath9 sym with @xmath29 ( that does not break the gauge symmetry ) actually arises from @xmath1 d3-branes ending on a commensurate number of d5-branes .",
    "its s - dual , corresponding to @xmath1 d3-branes ending on @xmath1 ns5-branes , has a non - trivial @xmath31 dimensional cft living on the boundary , coupled to the dynamics of the @xmath12 sym degrees of freedom via the boundary conditions . in this case",
    "the theory on has an @xmath32 global symmetry , implying that a potential gravitational dual must include @xmath32 gauge fields , so as mentioned above it can not be described by a background with a fixed spectrum in the large @xmath1 limit , and it seems that due to the large number of fields the dual is not weakly coupled ( at least near the boundary ) . note that even the neumann boundary condition described above presents a challenge for finding a gravitational dual , since it requires understanding the near - horizon geometry of @xmath1 d3-branes ending on a single ns5-brane , which is a challenging proposition ; however , in this case it is possible that a smooth gravitational dual could exist ( though it is not yet known ) .",
    "this raises the question of whether we can construct any examples of boundary conditions for @xmath12 sym on which can be usefully analyzed at large t hooft coupling using holographic techniques . to this end",
    "we investigate a more general class of boundary conditions described in @xcite , involving orientifold / orbifold fixed planes .",
    "we argue that there are specific classes of such examples , whose string theory dual involves @xmath33-planes or orbifold loci whose world - volumes are @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 in type iib string theory . with these more general boundary conditions",
    "one breaks the gauge group @xmath14 down to a subgroup @xmath15 , with neumann boundary conditions imposed on @xmath15-valued gauge fields ( and dirichlet on the others ) . for sufficiently large @xmath37",
    "the theory has only a few light excitations . for such boundary conditions we find holographic duals which are weakly curved @xmath38 quotients of type iib string theory on @xmath36 ( for @xmath39 ) , and the s - duals have similar properties .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in with a brief summary of the boundary conditions allowed for free quantum fields in .",
    "since our primary focus is on four dimensional gauge theories , we describe the basic issues involved in the choice of boundary conditions for massless vector fields in , which then sets the stage for our analysis of free @xmath9 sym on in .",
    "in particular , we compute the spectrum and the finite temperature partition sums of the free theory on with different choices of boundary conditions .",
    "one physical result we derive is that the free theory with neumann boundary conditions undergoes a large @xmath1 hagedorn transition on .",
    "the precise numerical value for the critical temperature depends on the choice of boundary conditions for the scalar fields , but it is clearly set by the length scale , @xmath40 . in we take preliminary steps to understanding the strongly coupled theory ; we are quickly led to a more comprehensive discussion of the boundary conditions , and this we undertake in .",
    "the simplest class of supersymmetric boundary conditions will turn out to be hard to understand holographically . as a result , in we will describe the supersymmetric boundary conditions involving quotients , some of which turn out to admit holographic duals which we can use to address the strong coupling phase structure of the theory .",
    "we end in with a discussion of open issues .",
    "two appendices contain some technical details .",
    "let us begin with a consideration of free quantum fields in .",
    "a well known fact about spacetimes is that they possess a time - like future null infinity @xmath6 , which implies that these spacetimes are not globally hyperbolic .",
    "this means that to have a well - posed cauchy problem one needs to prescribe sensible boundary conditions on the time - like boundary , which for global spacetimes is the einstein static universe , @xmath41 .    from early investigations on the subject",
    "@xcite it was clear that one can have non - trivial choices of boundary conditions to impose .",
    "we will first recall some of the basic facts regarding such boundary conditions for fields up to spin @xmath42 , since we will be primarily interested in quantum fields without gravity in asymptotically backgrounds .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of higher spins . to describe the boundary conditions it is useful to fix a metric on the spacetime .",
    "we find it convenient to work with global coordinates on : @xmath43 in these coordinates the conformal boundary of is obtained as @xmath44 .",
    "we will often use intuition from the ads / cft correspondence and discuss the interpretation of our boundary conditions from the point of view of a hypothetical dual cft living on ; .",
    "formally one can still view the spectral data of fields in in terms of representations of the isometry group @xmath4 , which is the conformal group for a @xmath45-dimensional cft . in some cases it may be possible to really have a physical dual conformal field theory , if the quantum field theory on ads space can be part of a consistent theory of quantum gravity , but we will not discuss this possibility here . ] independently of this , in certain cases the boundary conditions will lead to having physical degrees of freedom located on the boundary .    another useful fact to keep in mind is that itself , being conformally flat , can be mapped into a space conformal to via a simple coordinate change @xmath46 , which leads to the metric @xmath47 , \\label{globalesu}\\ ] ] where now the boundary is located at @xmath48 .",

    "since the two physical degrees of freedom of the gauge field in obey the conformal scalar wave equation , it follows that both these modes can be allowed to have either of the two natural boundary conditions discussed above .",
    "it is physically more intuitive however to phrase the boundary conditions in terms of the electric and magnetic components of the gauge field . while one can think of the electric component as related to @xmath310 , the magnetic component is really related to @xmath309 via electric - magnetic duality .",

    "the magnetic scalar has neumann boundary conditions , so one has a gauss law constraint forbidding magnetically charged states in the theory .",

    "one can however consider magnetically charged states in the theory , since now there is no gauss law constraint for the magnetic gauge field . in the context of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the dual cft@xmath90 now has a dynamical gauge field ( though with no three dimensional kinetic term ) instead of a conserved global current , and the lowest - dimensional gauge - invariant operator is its field strength . in the abelian case , electric - magnetic duality relates this field strength to a global symmetry current by @xmath325 .",

    "on the other hand the modified ( neumann ) boundary conditions entail treating @xmath310 as a dimension 2 operator and @xmath309 as a dimension 1 operator .",

    "the only issue to worry about is the one described earlier of having to impose gauss law for electrically charged or magnetically charged states in the theory .",
    "note that the boundary condition for the gauge field affects also other fields ; for instance , if we have a neumann boundary condition for the gauge field , we can not introduce sources for any electrically charged fields in the bulk , since such sources would not be gauge - invariant .",

    "there are two important issues to keep in mind whilst prescribing boundary conditions .",
    "one is that the dirac equation being first order , dirichlet boundary conditions can be quite constraining . secondly , the spinor representations in the bulk and boundary could have different number of components . as described in @xcite these two facts",

    "moreover , the chirality of the spinor is correlated with the sign of the mass term in ; positive chirality implies we should impose dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath347 and hence @xmath348 . * in even spacetime dimensions , on the other hand",
