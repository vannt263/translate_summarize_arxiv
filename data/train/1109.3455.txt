    "asteroseismology promises to expand our knowledge of the stars through the study of their oscillations .",
    "this promise has driven efforts to measure oscillations in solar - type stars with ground - based observations , but the requirement for precise measurements ( at the level of ms@xmath2 in radial velocity ) that are well - sampled over a long period of time have limited the number of detections to only a handful of stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "space - based missions are ideal to ensure continuous data sets and the _ corot _ satellite has measured oscillations in several stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the _ kepler mission _ is set to revolutionize the study of oscillations in main - sequence and subgiant stars by increasing the number of stars with high - quality observations by more than two orders of magnitude @xcite .    with the large number of stars observed by _",
    "it becomes possible to perform ensemble asteroseismology of stars with solar - like oscillations .",
    "this includes constructing asteroseismic diagrams , in which different measurements of the oscillation spectrum are plotted against each other , revealing features that are dependent upon the stellar structure .    for acoustic modes of high radial order , @xmath3 , and low angular degree , @xmath4 ,",
    "frequencies are well - approximated by the asymptotic relation @xcite : @xmath5 here , @xmath0 is the so - called large separation between modes of the same @xmath4 and consecutive @xmath3 , while @xmath6 is the small separation between modes of different @xmath4 , and @xmath1 is a dimensionless offset . to a good approximation",
    ", @xmath0 is proportional to the square root of the mean density of the star @xcite and in section [ scale ] we investigate the validity of this approximation .",
    "the small separations , @xmath6 , are sensitive to the structure of the core and hence to the age of the star , at least on the main sequence .",
    "these somewhat orthogonal dependencies leads to their use in the so - called c - d  diagram , in which the large and small separations are plotted against each other @xcite .",
    "calculating the c - d  diagram is one of the main aims of this paper .",
    "previous studies of the c - d  diagram and its variations have determined the expected evolution of stars with varying mass and metallicity @xcite , and assessed the feasibility of applying the diagram to real data @xcite . however , none of these studies followed the evolution beyond the end of the main sequence .",
    "recently , @xcite computed the theoretical spectrum of solar - like oscillations in red - giant stars , finding that the small separation @xmath7 depends almost linearly on @xmath0 , in agreement with the red - giant results from _ kepler _ @xcite . in section [ cd ]",
    "we bridge the gap , extending the c - d  diagram beyond main - sequence stars to the subgiants and up towards the tip of the red - giant branch .",
    "a complication with the c - d  diagram for subgiants and red - giant stars arises from mode bumping .",
    "as stars evolve , the convective envelope expands and the acoustic oscillation modes ( @xmath8 modes ) decrease in frequency . at the same time , @xmath9-mode oscillations that exist in the core of the star increase in frequency as the core becomes more centrally condensed .",
    "eventually , @xmath8- and @xmath9-mode frequencies overlap , resulting in oscillation modes that have a mixed character , behaving like @xmath9 modes in the core and @xmath8 modes in the envelope .",
    "the frequencies of these modes are shifted as they undergo avoided crossings @xcite , which leads to significant deviations from the asymptotic relation , equation  ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "this so - called mode bumping only affects non - radial modes , particularly @xmath4=1 but also @xmath4=2 , and so it complicates the measurement of the small separations .",
    "nevertheless , as we show , it is still possible to measure average separations that can be plotted in the c - d  diagram .    in this paper",
    "we also discuss an asteroseismic diagram that uses the quantity @xmath1 ( section [ epsilon ] ) . despite being investigated by @xcite ,",
    "this dimensionless phase offset has since been largely overlooked for its diagnostic potential .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that it could be useful in distinguishing odd and even modes when their identifications are ambiguous due to short mode lifetimes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using _",
    "kepler _ data ,",
    "@xcite have found that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are related in red giants , implying that , like @xmath0 , @xmath1 is a function of fundamental parameters .",
    "a similar analysis was done for _ corot _ data by @xcite .",
    "we discuss the use of @xmath1 for mode identification in section [ modeid ] .",
    "finally , we discuss an asteroseismic diagram for red - giant stars .",
    "a recent breakthrough has been made with the discovery of sequences of mixed modes in _ kepler _ red giants @xcite . because these mixed modes exhibit @xmath9-mode behavior in the core of the star , they are particularly sensitive to the core structure .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used the observed period spacings of these mixed modes , @xmath10 , to distinguish between red giants that are burning helium in their core and those that are still only burning hydrogen in a shell . @xcite",
    "have found similar results in _ corot _ red giants . in section [ gperiod ]",
    "we present the expected evolution of @xmath10 with @xmath0 in an asteroseismic diagram for red giant stars .",
    "a grid of 51000 stellar models was calculated from the zams to almost the tip of the red - giant branch using astec @xcite with the eff equation of state @xcite .",
    "we used the opacity tables of @xcite and @xcite for @xmath11k , with the solar mixture of @xcite .",
    "rotation , overshooting and diffusion were not included .",
    "the grid was created with fixed values of the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath12 ) and the initial hydrogen abundance ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the grid covered masses in the range 0.7 to @xmath14 with a resolution of @xmath15 and metallicities in the range @xmath16 with a resolution in @xmath17 of 0.2 dex .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the h - r diagram for models of near - solar metallicity ( @xmath18 ) for masses from 0.7 to @xmath19 .",
    "models that are hotter than the approximate cool edge of the classical instability strip @xcite are colored gray ; they are not expected to show solar - like oscillations because they do not have a significant convective envelope .",
    "many of these stars will show classical pulsations as @xmath20 scuti , @xmath21 dor or roap stars .",
    "however , we do note that @xcite announced evidence for solar - like oscillations in a @xmath20 scuti star .",
    "the model parameters chosen , and the physics included in the models , do have an impact on the model frequencies obtained .",
    "several studies have already investigated the impact of the choice of these parameters , including composition , mixing , overshooting and diffusion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we have not investigated the breadth of this parameter space with our model grid . our aim is to investigate the bulk behavior of asteroseismic observables across a wide range of evolutionary states , from the zams to the tip of the rgb .",
    "the adiabatic frequencies of every model were calculated using adipls @xcite , adjusted to enable proper sampling of the extremely high order eigenmodes that occur in red giants .",
    "oscillation frequencies determined from stellar models include more modes than can be observed .",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine asteroseismic parameters from them with care so that they are directly comparable to the parameters measured from data . here",
    "we outline our approach .",
    "it is important that we treat the frequencies from models and data the same , as much as possible , so that the comparisons between the two may be validly made .",
    "we therefore consider the observed characteristics of oscillations when deciding on a method for fitting to frequencies that can be consistently applied to both models and observations .",
    "the amplitudes of solar - like oscillations are modulated by an envelope that is approximately gaussian .",
    "the peak of this envelope is at @xmath22 , the frequency of maximum power . since it is near @xmath22 that the oscillations have the most power , and are therefore the most easily observed , we chose to measure the oscillation properties about this point . to determine @xmath22 for models we used the scaling relation @xcite , @xmath23    we must then choose which model frequencies to include in our calculation of asteroseismic parameters .",
    "we could simply take the frequencies within a specified range around @xmath22 , and fit to these frequencies .",
    "however , this causes difficulties when , as @xmath22 varies , frequencies at the top and bottom fall in and out of this range from one model to the next .",
    "this will result in jumps in the derived quantities that are not physical . to overcome this",
    ", we instead performed a weighted fit , using weights that decrease towards zero away from @xmath22 .",
    "inspired by the approximately gaussian envelope of the oscillation amplitudes , we weighted the frequencies by a gaussian window centered on @xmath22 .",
    "the width of this gaussian needs to be selected appropriately .",
    "the window should not be so wide as to include model frequencies that are unlikely to be observed .",
    "on the other hand , a narrower window is sensitive to departures from the asymptotic relation as a result of acoustic glitches .",
    "we have found that a full - width - at - half - maximum of @xmath24 is a good compromise .    to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we performed a weighted least - squares fit to the radial ( @xmath25 ) frequencies as a function of @xmath3 . by equation  ( [ asymp ] ) ,",
    "the gradient of this fit is @xmath0 and the intercept is @xmath26 .",
    "an example of a fit to the @xmath25 frequencies of a stellar model is shown in figure [ fig2 ] in chelle format , in which the frequencies are plotted against frequency modulo @xmath0 .",
    "in the chelle diagram , frequencies that are separated by precisely @xmath0 will align vertically .",
    "the curvature in the @xmath25 and @xmath27 ridges indicates variation in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or both ) as a function of frequency .",
    "our choice of the fitting method could potentially impact on our measured values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have tried different widths for the gaussian envelope and found that the measured value of @xmath0 does not vary significantly . however , there is a substantial change in the value of @xmath1 due to the influence of acoustic glitches @xcite .",
    "as the gaussian is made wider , more orders contribute to the fit , averaging over the curvature in the chelle diagram .",
    "narrower gaussians are more susceptible to curvature , which leads to a significant change in @xmath1 , which in extreme cases can approach a shift of 0.2 in @xmath1 .",
    "this is a greater concern for higher - mass stars , for which models exhibit greater curvature .",
    "our chosen gaussian window ( @xmath24 ) is wide enough to average over much of the curvature , while ensuring that no more frequencies are included in the fit to the models than can reasonably be expected to be observed .",
    "more sophisticated approaches , involving a fit to the curvature , are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "there are several small separations that can be measured .",
    "only modes with @xmath28 have been detected from solar - like oscillations in stars other than the sun , and in most cases , @xmath29 modes are not easily observed .",
    "the @xmath30 modes in subgiants can be significantly shifted in frequency due to avoided crossings , as exhibited by the model in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "although the @xmath27 modes also undergo avoided crossings , those modes that are bumped significantly in frequency have much greater inertia than non - bumped modes and hence much smaller amplitudes .",
    "this contrasts with mixed @xmath30 modes , for which even strongly bumped modes retain observable amplitudes .",
    "it follows that the @xmath27 ridge in the chelle diagram is quite well - defined , even in subgiant stars . for this reason",
    ", it is the small separation @xmath7 , between modes of @xmath25 and 2 , that we have chosen to measure . to minimize the effect of bumped modes on our measurement of @xmath7 from the models , we ignored those @xmath27 modes ( gray squares in figure [ fig2 ] ) whose inertia was significantly larger than that of adjacent non - bumped modes , typically by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "another consideration is that @xmath7 decreases with frequency .",
    "this can be seen in the gradual decrease of the separations between @xmath25 and @xmath27 modes , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "guided by the sun , for which @xmath7 decreases approximately linearly with frequency @xcite , we fitted the changing small separation by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a slope to be determined by the fit .",
    "we weighted this fit by the same gaussian envelope used in section [ measurelargesepeps ] . as for @xmath0",
    ", we did not find any significant change in the determined value of @xmath7 when we varied the envelope width .",

    "as previously mentioned , it is well - established that @xmath0 is approximately proportional to the square root of the mean density of the star .",
    "this leads to the scaling relation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean density of a star , @xmath0 is its large separation , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding quantities for the sun .",
    "this rather simple relation allows an estimate of the mean density of any star for which @xmath0 can be measured .",
    "given its widespread use , it is important to validate equation  ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "observationally , this can only be done for the handful of stars whose masses and radii have been measured independently . however , we can at least ask how accurately equation  ( [ scaling ] ) is followed by models .",
    "detailed model calculations have confirmed the scaling relation for main - sequence stars of low mass ( @xmath43 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite investigated the relation up to @xmath19 by calculating @xmath0 from the integral of the sound speed , @xmath44^{-1}$ ] .",
    "however , they only showed the relation between @xmath44^{-1}$ ] and @xmath0 measured from the frequencies for a restricted set of models .",
    "@xcite have also compared @xmath0 as calculated from the scaling relation to the average @xmath0 from calculated model frequencies for a representative subset of models of various masses and evolutionary states .",
    "while they found the scaling relation broadly applies , they did not investigate smaller scale deviations . with our calculations of @xmath0 , we are able to investigate the validity of the scaling relation more directly over a broader range of masses and evolutionary states .",
    "we show in figure [ fig4 ] the ratio of @xmath45 to @xmath46 as a function of @xmath0 for models of mass 0.72.0  @xmath47 and initial metallicity @xmath18 , close to the solar value .",
    "the section of the evolutionary tracks for which the models have a higher effective temperature than the approximate cool edge of the classical instability strip @xcite are colored gray . for reference ,",
    "four ` features ' in the evolutionary tracks of figure [ fig4 ] are indicated in the h - r diagram in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "these features relate to the onset of a convective envelope ( solid line ) and of a convective core ( long dashes ) , the hertzsprung gap towards the base of the rgb ( dot - dashes ) and the so - called ` bump ' ( short dashes ) where the hydrogen - burning shell burns through the discontinuity in molecular weight left from the deep convective envelope ( ` first dredge up ' ) during the early ascent of the rgb @xcite .",
    "since we are testing the scaling relation in models , it is appropriate that we use the value of @xmath42 from a solar model rather than the observed value in the sun .",
    "these values differ due to the offset between observed and computed oscillation frequencies .",
    "this offset is known to arise from an improper modeling of near - surface layers @xcite and is presumably a problem for other stars as well @xcite .",
    "the offset increases with frequency , at least in the sun , and so affects the large separation , with @xmath0 being @xmath48% greater in solar models than observed @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopted @xmath49 , derived from a fit to frequencies of the well - studied model  s of @xcite .",
    "we note that the surface offset also has a significant effect on @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "from figure [ fig4 ] we can see that the scaling relation holds quite well for lower - mass main - sequence stars , but there is a significant deviation at other masses and evolutionary states .",
    "these deviations can be as large as 3% for low - mass red giants and are over 10% within the instability strip .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the ratio against effective temperature , @xmath51 . from this",
    "we see that the deviation from the scaling relation is predominantly a function of effective temperature , which suggests that the scaling relation could be improved by incorporating a function of @xmath51 .",
    "a rough approximation to the models suggests a variation of the scaling relation of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 for stars with temperatures between 4700 and 6700k , except main - sequence stars below @xmath54 , for which it seems best to set @xmath55 . the function in equation  ( [ scaling3 ] ) is the black dashed line shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "making this adjustment improves the accuracy of the scaling relation to approximately 1% for these models .",
    "does metallicity also have an impact on the scaling relation ?",
    "in figure [ fig6 ] we show the ratio of @xmath45 to @xmath46 as a function of temperature for metal - poor ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 dex ) and metal - rich ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 dex ) models .",
    "we see that metallicity has little effect except for red giants , for which there is a slight dependence .",
    "after all this , however , we must keep in mind the surface correction . as discussed above",
    ", there is a frequency - dependent offset between models and observations that affects @xmath0 .",
    "a full investigation of this must await improvements to the models , but meanwhile we recommend that using equation  ( [ scaling2 ] ) ( or equation  ( [ scaling ] ) ) to estimate stellar densities from observed frequencies be based on the _ observed _ value of @xmath42 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the c - d  diagram is shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the solid lines show the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath7 for models with a metallicity close to solar and various masses .",
    "stars evolve from the top - right of the diagram to the bottom - left .",
    "isochrones are also shown as dashed lines . in applying this diagram",
    "it should be recalled that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are affected by the errors in the treatment of the near - surface layers .",
    "modeling indicates that , e.g. , the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath0 is less sensitive to surface layer effects @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows a modified c - d  diagram , which uses this frequency - separation ratio , although the surface dependency remains in @xmath0 .",
    "the isochrones are close to horizontal in this figure , showing that this ratio is an effective indicator of age .",
    "we note that @xmath0 is typically measured from the @xmath30 modes when calculating this ratio , but since the @xmath30 modes depart significantly from the asymptotic relation for more evolved stars , we have determined @xmath0 using only @xmath25 modes . in the absence of avoided crossings , the difference between @xmath0 as measured from @xmath25 and @xmath30 modes is small , so we expect this change in the definition of the ratio @xmath7/@xmath0 to have little impact .",
    "variations on the c - d  diagram may be constructed by using different small separations in place of @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have investigated the c - d  diagram using @xmath63 for main - sequence and rgb stars , respectively . for subgiants ,",
    "@xmath63 becomes poorly defined due to avoided crossings causing a major departure from the asymptotic relation ( see figure [ fig2 ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples ) .",
    "we have therefore not considered the @xmath63@xmath0 c - d  diagram here .",
    "the c - d  diagram is clearly most useful for main - sequence stars , particularly for masses @xmath64 , for which the evolutionary tracks are well separated .",
    "as stars evolve off the main sequence , their tracks converge for the subgiant and red - giant evolutionary stages .",
    "this convergence of the tracks means that the c - d  diagram is not a good discriminant of age and mass for these stars .",
    "this behavior of the model tracks is consistent with early results of red giants observed by _ kepler _ @xcite and the modeling results of @xcite , for which it was found that @xmath7 is an almost fixed fraction of @xmath0 .",
    "this also explains the observation by @xcite , when modeling the _ kepler _ subgiant kic11026764 , that including @xmath7 in the fit to the models did not provide an additional constraint beyond that provided by @xmath0 .    to compare the models with observations we have measured @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 from the published frequency lists of 20 stars using the methods outlined in section [ measure ] .",
    "the method described above was used for calculating @xmath7 except that , apart from the sun , the data did not justify the inclusion of @xmath32 as an extra parameter in the fit to the frequencies .",
    "we have therefore kept @xmath32 fixed at the solar value ( @xmath65 ) when fitting the other stars .",
    "doing so did not significantly affect the measured value of @xmath7 , or its uncertainty .",
    "the measured values are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] , along with the values adopted for @xmath22 when fitting the frequencies of each star .",
    "note that for two _ kepler _ main - sequence stars and 470 red giants we used published @xmath0 and @xmath7 values .    for three of the stars , the correct mode identification is ambiguous , and so we report both of the possible scenarios . in hd49933 , scenario b",
    "is now accepted as the correct identification @xcite , and scenario 1 in hd181420 seems most likely @xcite . with procyon",
    "the situation is not yet settled , as we discuss below .    in comparing the models with observations ,",
    "it is clear that the positions of main - sequence stars in the c - d  diagram can constrain their masses and ages . given the typical uncertainties in the observed values of @xmath0 and @xmath7 , the mass can be determined to a precision of a few percent , assuming that other model parameters , such as the mixing - length parameter , are valid for the stars .",
    "age is more difficult to constrain , owing to the considerably larger fractional uncertainty in @xmath7 .",
    "extreme cases are @xmath35  cen  b and @xmath33  ceti , which have large uncertainties in @xmath7 due to having few reported @xmath66 frequency pairs .",
    "it is worth noting that the published _",
    "kepler _ stars already have quite small uncertainties in the small separation , and this will further improve as more data are collected .    until now , we have only considered the c - d  diagram for models with near - solar metallicity . as shown by previous studies",
    ", the metallicity has a major impact on the tracks , as does the physics in the models used @xcite . the c - d  diagram for a series of metal - poor models (",
    "@xmath56 , blue ) and metal - rich models ( @xmath58 , red ) are plotted in figure [ fig9 ] . for metal - poor models , the tracks for a given mass shift up and to the left , and in the opposite direction for metal - rich models .",
    "the size of the shift underlines the importance of obtaining spectroscopic abundances for asteroseismic targets .    for subgiants , where the tracks converge for different masses , the position of the star could largely depend on metallicity .",
    "however , the presence of mixed @xmath27 modes can affect the measured small separation .",
    "furthermore , the expected shift in the small separation due to metallicity differences is similar in magnitude to the present measurement uncertainties in the small separation , limiting the usefulness of the small separation as a proxy for metallicity in subgiants .",
    "having extended the c - d  diagram beyond the main sequence , we have found that the evolutionary tracks converge for stars of different masses during the subgiant and red - giant phases .",
    "we now discuss the @xmath1  diagram , which breaks this degeneracy to some extent .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the @xmath1  diagram with evolutionary tracks for models of mass 0.72.0 m@xmath67 and @xmath18 .",
    "stars evolve from the top to the bottom in this diagram . unlike in the c - d  diagram",
    ", the evolutionary tracks in the @xmath1  diagram remain well separated for subgiants .",
    "this raises the possibility of using this diagram to constrain mass and age .",
    "however , some difficulties arise that make this challenging , as we now discuss",
    ".    there can be a large uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath1 , as is apparent for several stars shown in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "this can not be readily overcome by obtaining higher quality data because it is often due to the intrinsic curvature of the @xmath25 ridge in the chelle diagram . to resolve this",
    ", it may be necessary to fit to this curvature , although it may be difficult to do this consistently between models and observations in which only a few radial orders are observed .",
    "the value of @xmath1 from observations may also be ambiguous by @xmath68 since the radial order , @xmath3 , of the modes is unknown ( unlike for models ) . for the stars considered here",
    ", it seems that only scenario a of procyon has an ambiguous value of @xmath1 .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath1  diagram is the well - known offset between observed and computed oscillation frequencies , as mentioned earlier , which manifests itself as an offset in @xmath1 .",
    "this is the reason that the observed values of @xmath1 in figure [ fig10 ] are systematically offset from the models .",
    "one way to address this issue is to correct the model frequencies empirically , as suggested by @xcite",
    ". a more satisfactory approach would naturally be to improve the modeling of the near - surface layers .",
    "as in the c - d  diagram , metallicity has an impact on the evolutionary tracks in the @xmath1  diagram .",
    "diagrams for metal - poor stars ( @xmath56 ) and metal - rich stars ( @xmath58 ) are shown in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "the variation in the position of tracks due to metallicity further emphasizes the importance of supporting spectroscopic measurements .    for red giants",
    "the evolutionary tracks are seen to converge and become independent of mass and metallicity .",
    "it has previously been suggested that the near - surface offset is negligible in red giants @xcite .",
    "this was based upon finding model frequencies that were a close fit to observed frequencies without any need for a correction .",
    "however , figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] clearly show an offset between the models and observations .",
    "we suggest that the published models referenced above do not agree with observations as well as first thought .",
    "while the frequencies may appear to agree , the models may have a large separation slightly greater than than the observations . due to the low frequencies of red giant oscillations and the few orders observed this effect is subtle , but",
    "if more orders were observed the discrepancy would become clear .",
    "we have measured @xmath0 and @xmath1 consistently in models and observations and conclude that the near - surface offset is significant for red giants .",
    "finally , we address whether @xmath1 really does discriminate between different stellar masses .",
    "models indicate that it does , but given the significant contribution to @xmath1 from near - surface layers , which are presently poorly modeled , it is not yet known how the near - surface offset varies with mass , age or metallicity .",
    "it is therefore important to verify that stars of higher mass really do have lower values of @xmath1 , as the models predict . to do this , we consider the relative positions of stars with known masses in the @xmath1  diagram .",

    "the masses determined from the modeling and the spectroscopic metallicities are given in table [ tbl-2 ] , along with the the measured values of @xmath1 .",

    "the only deviations from this trend are kic11395018 and @xmath38 boo , both of which are substantially more metal - rich than the other subgiants . increased metalicity results in a larger @xmath1 for a star of a given mass ( figure [ fig11 ] ) , so it is no surprise that kic11395018 and @xmath38 boo have a slightly larger @xmath1 than kic11026764 , despite being more massive .",
    "this qualitative comparison shows that @xmath1 does depend on fundamental stellar parameters , such as mass and metallicity and confirms that @xmath1 is useful as an additional asteroseismic parameter .",
    "it has been difficult to establish the correct mode identification in f stars .",
    "short mode lifetimes in these stars result in large linewidths , blurring the distinction between the @xmath4=0,2 and @xmath4=1,3 ridges .",
    "it is common for both possible mode scenarios to be fitted .",
    "usually , it is noted that one of these identifications may be statistically more likely , although the alternative can not be ruled out .",
    "indeed , the initially favored ` scenario a ' of hd49933 @xcite was , with more data , found to be less likely than ` scenario b ' @xcite .",
    "@xcite favored the ` scenario b ' identification of the f5 subgiant procyon .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite favored ` scenario a ' based upon their analysis of the combined ground - based radial velocity and most space - based photometric observations . in modeling procyon",
    ", @xcite found scenario a to be least problematic from a modeling perspective , but could not rule out scenario b.    @xcite suggested that @xmath1 may be able to resolve this problem .",
    "they reasoned that , if @xmath1 varies slowly with stellar parameters then by scaling the frequencies of one star whose identification is clear and comparing to those of another should reveal the correct identification of the second .",
    "however , the @xmath1  diagrams presented in this paper cast doubt upon the validity of the assumption that @xmath1 varies slowly with stellar parameters . in some cases ,",
    "@xmath1 is seen to vary quite rapidly as the star evolves , particularly for higher - mass subgiants such as procyon .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that @xmath1 is still a useful quantity for determining the most plausible identification , especially if we plot it against effective temperature .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath85 for models , and for stars in which the mode identification is secure . in this figure",
    "the model tracks for different masses have much less spread than when plotted against @xmath0 ( figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "once again , the near - surface offset is apparent , with the models having a systematically lower @xmath1 than the observed stars .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig13 ] , there is little metallicity dependence in this relationship , except for red giants .",
    "therefore , given the effective temperature of a star , @xmath1 can be very useful in deciding the correct mode identification .    in figure [ fig14 ]",
    "we again plot @xmath1 against @xmath85 , but this time adding three f stars for which mode identifications are ambiguous : procyon , hd49933 and hd181420 . for hd49933 ,",
    "as previously mentioned , scenario  b is now considered to be correct , and indeed this is the identification that falls along the observed @xmath1@xmath85 trend .",
    "scenario  1 is the preferred identification in hd181420 , and again this matches the trend .",
    "unfortunately the situation in procyon is not completely clear .",
    "the trend with which we hope to identify the correct @xmath1 is still loosely defined due to the scarcity of f stars for which we have measured @xmath1 unambiguously .",
    "scenario b appears to lie towards the top of any range we could expect for @xmath1 for a star of its effective temperature .",
    "on the other hand , scenario a appears to be at the minimum . expecting a correction for near - surface effects ,",
    "we are inclined to believe scenario b is more likely , but we can not rule out the alternative . we anticipate that a measurement of @xmath1 in many f stars observed by _ kepler _ could help clearly define the observational @xmath1@xmath85 relation , clarifying the correct mode identification in procyon .",
    "theoretical studies of red giants predict a very dense frequency spectrum of non - radial modes @xcite .",
    "the vast majority are almost pure @xmath9 modes that are largely confined to the core of the star and thus have surface amplitudes that are too low to be observable .",
    "asymptotically , these modes are expected to exhibit an approximately equal period spacing , which we denote @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "there also exist @xmath8 modes in the convective envelope of the star that are equally spaced in frequency . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes of the same angular degree may undergo coupling .",
    "the modes undergoing this interaction take on a mixed character , with @xmath8-mode characteristics in the envelope and @xmath9-mode characteristics in the core .",
    "the mixed modes with enough @xmath8-mode character will be observable due to their reduced mode inertias and we can expect to see a few @xmath30 modes for each @xmath8-mode order . due to the weaker coupling between @xmath27 @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes ,",
    "few additional mixed modes are likely to be observed .",
    "early _ kepler _ results revealed that there were multiple @xmath30 peaks due to mixed modes in each radial order @xcite , which have recently been shown to have identifiable period spacings @xcite . since these gravity - dominated mixed modes propagate deeply into the core of the star , they are key indicators of core structure .",
    "@xcite found that the observed period spacing of the mixed @xmath30 modes can distinguish red giants burning helium in their cores from those still only burning hydrogen in a shell .",
    "similar results have also been found with _",
    "data @xcite .    as mentioned , in the absence of any interaction with @xmath8 modes",
    ", the @xmath9 modes will be approximately equally spaced in period . however , due to mode bumping , the observed period spacing ( @xmath10 ) is substantially smaller than the ` true ' , asymptotic @xmath9-mode period spacing ( @xmath86 ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that for red giants with the best signal - to - noise ratio , in which several mixed modes are observed in each radial order , the true period spacing may be recovered . however , for the vast majority of stars in their sample , this was not possible .",
    "instead they measured the average period spacing of the observed @xmath30 modes , @xmath10 .",
    "we have done likewise with models .    to measure @xmath10 from models",
    "it is first necessary to determine which modes would be observable .",
    "the mode with the lowest inertia in each order has the greatest amplitude and we calculated the period spacing between this mode and the two adjacent modes .",
    "we take the average of these period spacings in the range @xmath87 to calculate @xmath10 . in general",
    ", there will be variation in the number of @xmath30 modes observable in each order and detailed modeling of any star will have to take this into account . nevertheless , our method of including only the central three modes is sufficient to follow the expected evolution and mass dependence of @xmath10 .    in figure [ fig15 ]",
    "the solid lines show @xmath10 as a function of @xmath0 for our red - giant models . except for the highest mass model ( @xmath88 )",
    ", we have not evolved the models past the helium ignition .",
    "stars on the rgb evolve from right to left in this figure and we see a gradual decrease in @xmath10 through most of this phase . for stars with @xmath89",
    "we see only a weak dependence on mass .",
    "we confirm that @xmath10 as determined from the models for these lower - mass stars ( @xmath90s ) matches well with the @xmath10 seen in observations of red giants ( @xmath91s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as shown in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "higher - mass stars show larger @xmath10 .",
    "this raises the possibility that higher - mass rgb stars could be mistaken for helium - core - burning stars , although we note that few of these higher - mass stars may be expected to be observed due both to their lower abundance relative to lower - mass stars and their rapid evolution .",
    "following the evolution of low - mass stars past the tip of the red giant branch is difficult because they undergo a helium flash .",
    "models computed from the helium main sequence by montalbn et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "indicate period spacings around @xmath92s , in agreement with observations of core helium - burning stars @xcite .",
    "we were able to compute the evolution of a higher - mass star ( @xmath14 ) , which undergoes a more gradual onset of helium - core burning .",
    "after the model reaches the tip of the rgb , the period spacing increases rapidly due to the onset of a convective core @xcite , followed by an increase in the large separation .",
    "the loop in the track during this phase occurs during a lull in the energy generation from the core ; helium ignition occurs in pulses for this higher - mass model .",
    "the model then settles onto the secondary clump , where it spends a ( relatively ) long period of time , with period spacing increasing slowly while the large separation remains relatively constant .",
    "the model period spacings agree well with the observations by @xcite .",
    "as the model begins to move up the asymptotic giant branch , the period spacing and large separation decrease once more . to help indicate the evolution through this diagram , the blue diamonds in figure [ fig15 ] are equally spaced in age by 10myr , starting from 516.5myr . clearly , the secondary - clump stage of evolution is the longest , which is why we observe many more stars in this stage of their evolution than in other stages @xcite .",
    "the agreement of this track with observations is excellent .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of several measurements of the oscillation spectra of stars that exhibit solar - like oscillations .",
    "we conclude :    1 .",
    "the standard scaling relation for @xmath0 with density ( equation  ( [ scaling ] ) ) does quite well for lower - mass main - sequence stars , being correct to within a few percent , but larger deviations are found for other masses and evolutionary states .",
    "these deviations are predominantly a function of effective temperature and we suggest that the scaling relation may be improved by including a function of @xmath85 ( equation  ( [ scaling2 ] ) ) .",
    "2 .   for main - sequence stars ,",
    "their position in the diagram is able to significantly constrain their mass .",
    "age is less well - constrained due to the uncertainty in @xmath7 generally being relatively larger than that in @xmath0 . when stars evolve into subgiants the tracks converge , which limits the ability of the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath7 to constrain the mass and age .",
    "3 .   in the @xmath1  diagram ,",
    "the degeneracy of the evolutionary tracks during the subgiant stage is partially broken .",
    "this suggests that the position of stars in this diagram could help constrain their masses and ages , although difficulties in measuring @xmath1 and the near - surface offset presently limit this diagram s usefulness .",
    "we find the near - surface offset is non - negligible for red giants , contrary to earlier claims .",
    "4 .   measuring @xmath1 shows promise for mode identification in stars where this is ambiguous due to short mode lifetimes .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 is seen to depend mostly on effective temperature .",
    "provided @xmath85 is known , the correct @xmath1 and therefore the correct mode identification may be deduced .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of g - mode period spacings ( @xmath10 ) in models of red giant stars .",
    "models with masses below @xmath93 show a weak dependence of @xmath10 on mass . for higher - mass stars , the observed position of the secondary clump in the @xmath10@xmath0 diagram",
