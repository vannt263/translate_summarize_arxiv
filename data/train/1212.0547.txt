    "the physics of interacting electrons in strongly disordered media involves a delicate interplay between cooper pairing , anderson localization , and coulomb repulsion .",
    "the nature of the resulting low - temperature phases has long been an active topic of research  @xcite : although a quantum superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) is generally believed to occur , the actuating mechanism(s ) , the nature of the insulating phases and of their charge carriers , and the possible existence of a zero - temperature metallic regime  @xcite are still open and much - discussed questions  @xcite .",
    "theories of the transition vary , e.g. , in whether they incorporate the composite nature of cooper pairs and the repulsive and/or long - range parts of the coulomb interaction , and in the nature of the disorder considered ; the importance of each of these factors in the condensed - matter systems studied is not , in general , understood _ a priori_.    it is thus hoped that the microscopically well - characterized settings provided by ultracold atomic gases , trapped in controllably disordered environments  @xcite , can shed light on the sit . beyond this general motivation for studying the sit in ultracold atomic gases , we note that two major approaches to the sit correspond to the limits of bcs and bec pairing respectively  namely , ( i )  those that investigate the bcs pairing of localized electrons , ignoring phase fluctuations and repulsion  @xcite ; and ( ii )  those that address tightly bound , repulsively interacting bosons via ( e.g. ) the bose - hubbard model , ignoring their composite character  @xcite .",
    "as these approaches correspond respectively to the bcs and bec limits , interpolating between them is equivalent to understanding how the sit evolves as one tunes across the bec - bcs crossover via a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "this question has not , to our knowledge , been previously considered in detail ; the limiting cases are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and disorder effects on the superconducting transition temperature have been treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "as these works observe , superconductivity is more robust to disorder in the bcs regime than in the bec regime , owing to anderson s theorem  @xcite ; however , the properties of the sit in the intermediate , near - unitary regime have received little attention .    in the present work",
    "we address the nature of the sit in the intermediate region , focusing on the morphology of the zero - temperature phase diagram .",
    "our treatment is quantitatively valid for narrow feshbach resonances and/or dense gases  @xcite ; the former of these limits can be realized in experiments with @xmath0li  @xcite ( which has a narrow resonance at approximately 543 g  @xcite ) . in the narrow - resonance limit ,",
    "we show that the superconductor - insulator phase boundary is , for a certain range of disorder strengths , nonmonotonic as a function of detuning from the feshbach resonance , involving an intermediate insulating phase for detunings slightly below the mobility edge .",
    "we establish this central , unexpected , result both for bounded disorder and for unbounded gaussian disorder ( which is most relevant , e.g. , to optical speckle potentials ) .",
    "we argue that the shape of the phase diagram can be understood in terms of a competition between the pairing instability and the tendency of cooper pairs , which are bosons , to condense into deeply localized states ; thus , the intermediate insulating phase has fermions of large localization length coexisting with deeply localized bosons .",
    "we discuss the feasibility of realizing this intermediate insulating phase , and finally note possible connections between our analysis and the @xmath1-expansion approach pioneered by nishida and son  @xcite .",
    "we consider the two - channel model of a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "this model involves fermionic gases consisting of consisting of two `` spin '' species ( i.e. , internal states ) , coupled to a gas of bosonic molecular states , such that two fermions can pair up to form a bosonic molecule :    [ eq : model ] h & = & d^d x _ _ ^ ( ) ( - + v ( ) - ) _ ( ) + & & + ^ ( ) ( - + v ( ) + - 2 ) ( ) + & & + u ( ^ ( ) ( ) ) ^2 + g ( ^ ( ) _ ( ) _ ( ) + ) this hamiltonian was analyzed for clean systems in ref .",
    "@xcite in the small-@xmath2 limit ; note , however , that a weakly - coupled two - channel description applies near unitarity for _ all _ short - range fermionic interactions near four dimensions  @xcite . for disordered systems , we have supplemented the hamiltonian of ref .",
    "@xcite with a contact repulsion of strength @xmath3 among the bosons , which is assumed to be smaller than the other energy scales ; this contact term , always physically present , can be neglected for clean systems , but must be included for disordered systems in order to circumvent the pathological behavior of the disordered noninteracting bose gas .",
    "as we shall see , our results are insensitive to @xmath3 .",
    "the potential @xmath4 includes both disorder and ( in principle ) a periodic potential ( note , however , that the narrow - resonance model does _ not _ correspond to the attractive-@xmath3 hubbard model , as pair hopping is explicitly included in @xmath5 and does not arise by a superexchange mechanism ) .",
    "we shall focus on three- ( or higher- ) dimensional systems , in which the single - particle ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) hamiltonian has both localized and extended eigenstates , separated by a mobility edge  @xcite at some energy @xmath7 . for most of the present work , we shall take the disorder distribution to be specified through @xmath7 ( which scales with the disorder strength ) and the single - particle density of states @xmath8 .",
    "we first analyze the case of a bounded disorder distribution without spatial correlations ( e.g. , a box distribution  @xcite ) and then turn to the case of unbounded gaussian disorder with short - range correlations ( which is relevant , e.g. , to the current speckle - potential - based experimental realizations  @xcite ) .",
    "while our work does not explicitly treat the case of smoothly varying or correlated disorder , such an extension would be straightforward .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "first , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 ( known as the infinitely - narrow resonance limit  @xcite ) , in which it consists of decoupled fermionic and bosonic channels ( fig .  [",
    "fig : narrowres ] ) .",
    "the equation of state for each of these channels is known , and these results can be combined to form a `` zeroth - order '' theory valid throughout the crossover . having established the structure of this @xmath6 theory , we include the effects of @xmath2 perturbatively , to lowest order , adapting the results of ref .",
    "this perturbative analysis shows the existence of regimes of reentrant superconductivity , which , we argue , offer a conservative estimate of the parameter range in which reentrant behavior takes place .",
    "the primary motivation for choosing the narrow resonance approach is that it enables us to study the entire bec - bcs crossover while working at strong disorder ( in contrast with previous works  @xcite ) .     and is therefore unoccupied ; all the particles are in the fermi channel .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath9 is taken to be above the mobility edge @xmath7 .",
    "( b )  crossover region : @xmath10 is lower than @xmath9 ; therefore , fermions with energies above @xmath10 pair and migrate into the molecular channel .",
    "the molecules can not all populate the lowest bosonic state owing to repulsive interactions between them ; therefore , they occupy a finite energy range . ]",
    "in this section we briefly outline the general properties that the sit is expected to exhibit in the bec and bcs limits , without specific reference to the narrow - resonance model . for the purposes of this section",
    "we shall assume that there is no underlying lattice .",
    "we then proceed , in the following sections , to show that the narrow - resonance approach both reproduces these expectations and provides a useful scheme for interpolating between them .",
    "_ bcs limit_. in the bcs limit , the nature of the ground state depends on the location of the fermi energy @xmath9 with respect to the mobility edge @xmath7  @xcite . in particular , if @xmath11 then for any infinitesimal attraction ( i.e. , any detuning ) the ground state is superconducting  @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath12 then a finite minimum attraction  @xcite is necessary to give rise to a superconducting state .",
    "thus , for @xmath12 an insulating ground state obtains deep in the bcs regime , but as the detuning is decreased ( and the bcs coupling becomes stronger ) a transition to a superconductor takes place .",
    "thus , at fixed disorder , the critical density behaves as in the `` bcs '' side of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagb](a ) : it is asymptotically given by the criterion @xmath13 , but closer to resonance the critical density decreases .",
    "_ bec limit_. in the bec limit , the sit is governed by a competition between the repulsion between the cooper pairs and the disorder strength . for weak repulsive interactions the bosons occupy isolated deep wells of the disorder potential ; as the repulsive interaction strength ( or density ) is increased , they occupy more and more wells of the disorder potential , until eventually the josephson coupling between the wells is strong enough to give rise to global phase coherence .",
    "an approximate criterion  @xcite for the critical repulsive interaction strength is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the boson - boson scattering length ( which decreases to zero as one tunes away from resonance ) .",
    "thus , sufficiently deep in the bec limit , the ground state is always insulating , as shown in the `` bec '' side of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagb](a ) ; this is in sharp contrast with the bcs limit discussed above .",
    "_ crossover_. the considerations above suggest that , for a given disorder strength , the lowest critical density for the sit occurs in the crossover regime ( or , equivalently , that superconductivity is most robust against disorder in the crossover regime ) .",
    "thus , the critical disorder is evidently a non - monotonic function of density , with quite different functional forms in the two limits . in what follows",
    ", we shall discuss this nonmonotonic function at a more quantitative level .",
    "we first address the conceptually simple case of bounded disorder , and then extend our results to uncorrelated gaussian disorder . as discussed above , we consider the decoupled ( @xmath6 ) limit first , then work perturbatively in @xmath2 .",
    "we begin with the limit of an infinitely narrow resonance ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , so that the fermions and bosons are decoupled .",

    ", all fermions are tightly bound into molecules interacting via the weak contact repulsion @xmath3 .",
    "the case of @xmath19 is pathological , as it involves all bosons occupying the lowest single - particle state ; for small nonzero @xmath3 , however , the bosons form a `` bose glass '' consisting of widely separated , mutually phase - incoherent , puddles of bosons at deep disorder minima : thus , the system is insulating regardless of the relative locations of @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath3 ( or the corresponding scattering length @xmath20 ) is small enough , and the relevant densities low enough ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) , that the molecules are located in the exponentially rare lifshitz tail states  @xcite of the disorder potential .",

    "as one decreases @xmath10 until it is lower than @xmath9 , the chemical potential @xmath22 begins to track @xmath10 , as it is favorable for fermions with energies greater than @xmath10 to pair up into molecules , which then form a bose glass .",
    "in contrast with the clean case  @xcite , we must self - consistently determine the chemical potential , as the bosons trapped in deep rare wells interact .",
    "we first determine the chemical potential due to a dilute gas of interacting bosons at density @xmath23 , adapting the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite as detailed in the appendix ; the result is :    [ chempot ] + ^-2/3 where @xmath24 is the characteristic energy scale associated with the disorder , and @xmath25 , where @xmath15 is the scattering length for bosons .",
    "( note that the chemical potential therefore depends weakly on @xmath3 . ) given this expression , one can determine the density of bosons in the intermediate regime , assuming they are able to equilibrate with the fermions , by setting the two chemical potentials to be equal , and noting that the number of molecules created is one half the number of fermions depleted from the fermi sea :    [ nb ] n_b ( ) = _ ^e_f ( e ) de , where @xmath8 is the density of states for the fermions .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ chempot ] , [ nb ] ) together comprise an equation of state for the composite system in the @xmath6 limit ; the dependence of the chemical potential on detuning is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mumoves ] .",
    "the qualitative behavior they imply is as follows . in the `` metallic '' case where @xmath11",
    ", @xmath22 decreases past @xmath7 for some @xmath10 ; at this point , the fermionic sector undergoes a metal - insulator transition , and consequently ( as the bosons are trapped in isolated wells ) the composite system becomes insulating . on the other hand , in the `` insulating '' case where @xmath12 , the system is always insulating .",
    "therefore , in this limit one is led to the schematic phase diagram denoted by the black dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagb](a ) .",
    "the above discussion extends trivially to the case of a lattice with one or more bands ; each band generically has an upper and a lower mobility edge , and metal - insulator transitions occur whenever the chemical potential ( which is approximately @xmath10 ) coincides with a mobility edge . for sufficiently small @xmath3",
    ", bosons always occupy localized states near the bottom of the lowest band , and do not contribute to transport .",
    "we now consider how the above picture is altered for small but finite @xmath2 .",
    "we first briefly sketch how the narrow - resonance formalism reproduces the known qualitative features of both the bcs and bec regimes  @xcite , and then turn to the intermediate regime .",
    "_ bcs regime , @xmath17_. in this regime , there is a gap to the creation of molecules ; therefore , the bosonic channel can be integrated out .",
    "the nature of the ground state depends on the position of @xmath9 relative to @xmath7 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the fermi energy is among the extended states ( i.e. , the @xmath6 state is metallic ) , and bcs pairing occurs for arbitrary @xmath27 and arbitrary @xmath10 , with a gap scale set by @xmath28 $ ] . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the fermi energy is among the localized states ; pairing occurs in this regime , but only for couplings above some critical value @xmath30 ( or , more relevantly to the present discussion , above some critical value @xmath31 ) , for which a rough estimate is given by the following implicit expression  @xcite :    [ feigel ] ( ) ^3 1 . where @xmath32 is the localization length critical exponent , which is approximately unity  @xcite .",
    "thus , at zero temperature the system is insulating in the deep bcs regime ( @xmath33 ) , but undergoes an sit upon sweeping toward resonance , as @xmath10 decreases and the effective superconducting coupling @xmath34 correspondingly increases .",
    "_ bec regime , @xmath35_. in this regime , all fermions are dimerized and there is a gap to the breaking of molecules ; therefore , the fermions can be integrated out , giving rise , for any @xmath27 , to an effective repulsive interaction among the molecules .",
    "the strength of this induced interaction depends on the associated energy denominator .",
    "in particular , deep in the bec regime , the induced interaction is parameterized by the scattering length  @xcite    [ eq : ab ] a_b = , which decreases as @xmath36 .",
    "note that , while the narrow - resonance behavior of @xmath15 differs quantitatively from the broad - resonance value  @xcite , the _ trend _ that interactions weaken far from the resonance is true in both cases .",
    "moreover , as previously discussed , our results for the disordered system depend only logarithmically on @xmath15 , so that the distinction between the narrow- and broad - resonance scattering lengths is immaterial for our purposes . note that if the quantity    exceeds the characteristic disorder scale @xmath24 , the bose glass undergoes a transition to a superfluid state . consequently",
    ", the ground state in the bec regime is a superfluid for sufficiently high densities _ and _ interaction strengths , whereas in the bcs regime it is a superfluid at high densities , _ regardless _ of the interaction strength .",
    "the intermediate regime poses greater difficulties : in this regime , the system possesses both fermionic and bosonic excitations at the chemical potential , so that , in principle , neither channel can safely be integrated out .",
    "the argument of the present section is that one can nevertheless compute certain properties of the phase diagram in this regime , and show , in particular , that the critical coupling is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath10 . for specificity , we shall focus during this argument on the case of a three - dimensional anderson lattice model  @xcite , with on - site energies drawn from the uniform distribution",

    "the density of states @xmath8 is known  @xcite to be analytic around @xmath7 , so it follows that , if @xmath7 is near the center of the band , @xmath8 is approximately constant near @xmath7 . under these conditions",

    "we argue that , under the assumptions above , @xmath30 is in general a non - monotonic function of @xmath22 and therefore of @xmath10 .",
    "we now discuss how pairing arises in this regime , and estimate the pairing strength .",
    "in contrast to the bcs and bec limits , the intermediate regime requires us to consider _ which _ bosonic states mediate the pairing interactions  in the clean system , one can assume that pairing is mediated by the zero - momentum bosonic state  @xcite , but this has no direct analog in the disordered system . to address this issue ,",
    "we first note that there are , in principle , two kinds of bosonic states that can mediate pairing : ( i )  the exponentially rare , but strongly interacting lifshitz tail states within @xmath2 of the chemical potential , and ( ii )  the more abundant but relatively weakly interacting states with appreciable gaps .",
    "we argue that , under the assumptions listed above , the lifshitz - tail contribution to pairing is negligible , so that all the _ relevant _ bosonic degrees of freedom are in fact gapped and can be integrated out , allowing us to adapt the bcs - limit results with some effective energy denominator @xmath47 .",
    "( we shall qualitatively address the role of the tail states in the next subsection , and show that they _",
    "accentuate _ the nonmonotonicity of the phase diagram . )",
    "the argument for neglecting the lifshitz tail states runs as follows .",
    "the resonant pairing mediated by the tail states within a window @xmath48 of the chemical potential can be estimated as    m _",
    "g p_b where @xmath23 is the density of bosons ; @xmath49 is the number of resonant tail states @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 is related to @xmath52 ; and the coupling is modulated by a typical overlap integral ( of the form @xmath53 ) associated with the fermion - boson coupling [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) ] .",
    "by contrast , the off - resonant pairing mediated by higher - energy bosonic states within an energy window @xmath48 can roughly be estimated as    m(e ) ~ _ b(e ) de ^2 , where @xmath54 is the bosonic density of states at @xmath55 .",
    "comparing these two expressions , one finds that ( even ignoring the nature of the overlaps ) , the exponential increase in the number of states outweighs the decreased coupling to each state , so long as @xmath56 , which is always true for @xmath57 ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) .",
    "furthermore , the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that wavefunctions far apart in energy are in fact spatially _",
    "anticorrelated_. this effect would further suppress the interactions between the fermions and the tail - state bosons , and therefore extend the regime of quantitative validity of the present analysis .",
    "having established that the tail states contribute negligibly to pairing , we now estimate which states do provide the dominant pairing interactions .",
    "one can easily see that states that are too high in energy can not contribute to pairing , as for these states the matrix elements of the form @xmath59 are products of three rapidly oscillating functions and must vanish . combining these observations ( viz .",
    "that both states with very small energy denominators and those with large energy denominators are negligible ) , one sees that @xmath60 must be peaked at some @xmath47 measured from @xmath10 .",

    "the fermions would primarily interact with the lowest , nodeless bosonic modes supported on these sites . ] .",
    "however , for our purposes we only need the fact that it is nonzero , which enables us to estimate a bcs pairing interaction of strength @xmath63 .",
    "it is crucial to note that @xmath64 _ increases _ as one tunes toward resonance , because @xmath65  constant , and @xmath66 increases as the tail states fill up with bosons .",
    "the arguments above lead us to a problem involving only fermionic states at the chemical potential and virtual bosonic states @xmath67 away from it .",

    "the discussion above suggests a simple physical picture of the insulating phase in the intermediate regime : viz . that it consists of two interpenetrating insulators , a lifshitz glass  @xcite and a `` fractal insulator ''  @xcite , which are essentially _ mutually noninteracting _ because of the lack of wavefunction overlap .",

    "the coupling between the systems grows for smaller @xmath10 and/or higher densities , as the chemical potential then no longer lies in the bosonic lifshitz tail ( defined as the region in which the density of states grows exponentially with energy ) ; in this regime , a more suitable model is to treat the fermions as being strongly proximity - coupled to puddles of bosonic superfluid  @xcite .",
    "we now extend our results to the case of uncorrelated gaussian disorder of the same characteristic energy scale @xmath24 , the case most directly relevant to recent experiments in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the essential distinction between bounded and unbounded disorder is the nature of the lifshitz tail  @xcite ; in the uncorrelated gaussian case , the density of states in the tail scales as @xmath86 . for unbounded disorder",
    ", there is some finite probability of finding states at arbitrarily low energies , so the bosonic band is not bounded below .",
    "thus , the bcs and bec regimes are not sharply separated : at any detuning , there are _ some _ molecular states as well as _ some _ fermionic states , and",
    "the system is always in the intermediate regime discussed above . to extend the previous analysis to this case",
    ", it suffices to replace eq .",
    "( [ chempot ] ) with the following expression  @xcite :    [ chempot2 ] = - ^2 note that eq .",
    "( [ chempot2 ] ) , unlike eq .",
    "( [ chempot ] ) , predicts that , regardless of @xmath10 , @xmath87 ( although the difference vanishes as @xmath88 in the clean system limit ) . this replacement changes various quantitative features of the phase diagram , but our qualitative conclusions ( and in particular , the possibility of a nonmonotonic superfluid - insulator boundary ) still hold ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagb](d)-(e ) ) .",
    "another frequently considered , unbounded disorder distribution is the lorentzian distribution , for which the density of states can be computed exactly  @xcite ; however , this distribution does not possess an exponential lifshitz tail ( instead , the tail density of states falls off as @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , the relative contribution of tail states to pairing is much larger than in the bounded or gaussian cases .",
    "while the qualitative considerations of the previous section are expected to apply here , the parameter - dependence of the transition line is expected to differ substantially .",
    "this work has addressed the behavior of the superfluid - insulator transition for disordered fermi gases across a bec - bcs crossover , focusing on the intermediate ( i.e. , near - unitary ) regime .",
    "we have established that the superfluid - insulator phase boundary is nonmonotonic as a function of detuning , so that an experiment sweeping across a feshbach resonance can in principle see three separate transitions .",
    "we were able to establish these conclusions quantitatively only in the narrow - resonance regime ( i.e. , where the energy scale associated with the feshbach resonance width  @xcite is smaller than the fermi energy ) ; however , it is plausible that , as long as the resonance is not too broad ( i.e. , if @xmath90 ) , the proximity to an insulating phase will manifest itself in a nonmonotonic critical temperature .",
    "moreover , narrow feshbach resonances do exist ( e.g. , @xmath91 in @xmath0li  @xcite ) , and have been proposed as a way of realizing higher - temperature superconducting transitions in ultracold atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "finally , one should note that , as the width of the resonance is measured relative to the fermi energy , all experiments at sufficiently high densities ( e.g. , in tightly confining traps ) can be described by a narrow - resonance model . in order to stress the importance of the mobility edge",
    ", we have restricted our analysis to three - dimensional disordered systems ; however , the generalization to systems of reduced dimensionality is straightforward .",
    "a separate limitation of our analysis , which applies generally to the dynamics of disordered quantum systems , is that in considering the equilibrium state we have neglected the experimentally relevant question of whether equilibrium is achieved on the relevant timescales ( which must , at a minimum , be much larger than @xmath92 in the narrow - resonance limit ) .",
    "indeed , recent work on the many - body localization problem  @xcite suggests that closely related systems do not equilibrate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "_ near - unitary system in @xmath93 dimensions_. finally , we note that the weakly - coupled two - channel model [ eq .  ( [ eq : model ] ) ] becomes valid for any feshbach resonance , near unitarity , as the dimensionality of space approaches four .",
    "( the resemblance arises because the two - body wavefunction at resonance is sharply peaked when the particle positions coincide , so that weakly bound or even resonant fermion pairs behave like pointlike bosons  @xcite . )",
    "it follows that the ground state at unitarity is insulating for arbitrarily weak disorder near four dimensions .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the ground state near unitarity is also generically insulating near _ two _ dimensions , by the following logic . near two dimensions",
    ", unitarity corresponds to vanishingly attractive interactions ; however , a finite disorder strength would localize all single particle states in two dimensions , thus overcoming an infinitesimal pairing term . as a consequence , the phase diagram and transition temperature of a disordered unitary fermi gas",
    "are nonmonotonic as a function of dimensionality , in contrast with the clean - system limit  @xcite .",
    "that the sit occurs for weak disorder in both the @xmath94- and @xmath95-dimensional limits suggests the @xmath1-expansion as a promising strategy for future studies of the unitary - gas sit using renormalization - group methods  @xcite .",
    "i am indebted to markus mller , philipp strack , arijeet pal , johannes bauer , and paul goldbart for helpful discussions , and to markus mller , arijeet pal , and philipp strack for a critical reading of this manuscript .",
    "this work was supported in part by the doe division of materials science under grant no .",
    "de - fg02 - 07er46453 , and in part by the harvard quantum optics center .",
    "we briefly sketch how the density of bosons confined in lifshitz tail states can be estimated , for the case of bounded disorder .",
    "( the unbounded case is addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) for concreteness we assume the on - site disorder takes on two values , @xmath96 .",
    "suppose the chemical potential is in the lifshitz tail ; then , according to a standard argument  @xcite , the single - particle states that can be filled must have dimensions of at least @xmath97 .",
    "in the thomas - fermi approximation ( valid for the relatively large wells in the lifshitz tail ) , a well of size @xmath98 typically holds @xmath99 particles ; put differently , a typical well at energy @xmath55 holds @xmath100 particles . the total number of particles is given by    n = n(e ) ( e ) de , where we can use the well - known result  @xcite for the density of states , @xmath101 .",
    "this integral is dominated by the contribution from energies around @xmath22 . therefore , to logarithmic accuracy , one can invert the relation between @xmath102 and @xmath22 to write        m. ma and p. a. lee , phys . rev .",
