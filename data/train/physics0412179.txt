    "molecular wave packet engineering has attracted much attention in the works collected under the rubric of `` quantum control '' @xmath2 .",
    "current world - wide efforts in the problematic have been mounted to develop efficient methods for breaking selected molecular bonds @xmath3 or to harness specific molecular states for optical processing devices and spectroscopic uses .",
    "the rapid progress did not take a long time , because it was prepared by the enormous lore in photomolecular spectroscopy accumulated since lord rayleigh epoch and the beginning of quantum mechanics . from the other hand ,",
    "optimal control theory comprising dynamic programming and modern variational calculus has been the subject of mathematical studies enabling to propose a theoretical apparatus to the quantum control .    of prime importance were the minimum quantum uncertainty",
    "states introduced by schrdinger . for decades",
    "they were meant of only as `` gedankenexperimente '' .",
    "up - to - date femtosecond technique has made it possible to observe both classically confined states of rydberg atoms @xmath4 and space - localized wave packets in molecules @xmath5 .",
    "the title of this paper obliges us to restrict ourselves by the latter .",
    "the quantum control theory of ultrafast events close to dissociation limit of diatomic molecules is our major concern .",
    "the challenge here is to find optimal laser excitation of picosecond scale causing femtosecond radiation of an optically thin sample .",
    "we shall deal with the subject regarding the iodine @xmath1 molecule as our test example .",
    "diatomic iodine in gas or condensed state has become the reference standard @xmath6 and ideal benchmark @xmath7 in modelling the wave packet evolution .",
    "our task is greatly facilitated by the considerable volume of researches , in which the quantun control of molecular motion has been exploited theoretically @xmath8 .",
    "the following experiments @xmath9 with the laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) have supported the idea of wave packet localization inside a molecule .",
    "these works have again emphasized the link of the phase modulated photoexcitation and molecular vibrations , which was broadly known in raman spectroscopy from 1920s @xmath10 .",
    "the goal yet achieved in the dynamic quantum control @xmath11 includes localization of the vibrational wave packet at the attractive side of molecular potential .",
    "this scheme was referred to as the molecular reflectron @xmath12 .",
    "bulk literature has been devoted to focusing the matter states @xmath13 .",
    "the right posed theoretical limits @xmath14 indicate an existence of femtosecond coherence .",
    "our approach to the problem of a drastical shortening optical transient of a single molecule is started from a crucial relation between a time - reverse molecular dynamics and phase conjugate resonance scattering field .",
    "a considerable interest presents a justification of the relation , which , despite its generality , we have not been able to find in the literature .",
    "there are two aspects : designing a right chosen objective and tailormaking optimal optical pulses . to understand how they appear , it is worth noting , that the rapid improving of femtosecond techniques is based on compression of chirped light pulses provided by the well - established wave guides in optics .",
    "one can borrow the key element of the pulse compression physics to apply it to squeezing an optical coherence inside molecular space .",
    "namely , the franck - condon region must play a role both dispersive wave guide and frequency modulator owing to molecular vibrations .",
    "the vibrational wave packet is expected to be focused at will on inner franck - condon region , since the franck - condon factor is at its maximum at the steep repulsive curve .",
    "simultaneously the momentum variance @xmath15 will be maximal at this point with @xmath16 being the wave packet velocity .",
    "the uncertainty principle @xmath17 guarantees a tight localization @xmath18 of the rebound wave packet .",
    "thus , its overlap with the ground state , having the variance @xmath19 , lasts just for recoil lifetime ( @xmath20 ) and gives rise to ultrashort coherent transient .",
    "this picture appeals to the `` billard ball '' model , @xmath21 which still remains to be extended to involve spreading wave packets on molecular curves .",
    "as example we shall look at the reflectron scheme .",
    "the specific iodine reflectron @xmath22 works at certain frequency above the ground state x. a tailored electric field excites the b state until the wave packet begins to concentrate near an outer turning point far removed from the location of the original franck - condon transitions .",
    "the closer the excitations to the dissociation limit , the longer a delay before the wave packet will be reflected from the outer curve and moves back to inner repulsive core . from here",
    "the wave packet recoils and may radiate photons of resonant frequency to the b - x transition , so that , an optical coherence begins to appear with a some delay .",
    "this `` dark '' period might cause a fluorescence to spark at a chosen time .    having the name drawn from the electronic prototype ,",
    "the molecular reflectron is the scheme to create vibrational wave packet and to focus it on a desired material target .",
    "our prime interest is a radiation process , in which the wave packet is periodically returning into resonance franck - condon region and recoiling from it .",
    "hence , a molecular `` magnetron '' is the best - fitting term to our design , which underlines a parallel between optical - molecular and radio - electronic phenomena .",
    "in fact , the vibrational wave packet spreading assisted by molecular anharmonicity could be negated by the tailored laser pulse , because an interplay between its modulation and quantum dispersion squeezes the wave packet , as does a properly chirped radio pulse propagating along a dispersive delay line .",
    "molecular states promoted nearby their dissociation limit can be localized more tightly than the ground state by itself . for the excited levels",
    "are quasiclassical in their nature .",
    "thus , we can treat the recoil lifetime @xmath23 as a kinematical overlap of the state x and b presented schematically in figure 1 . here",
    ", the resonance franck - condon transitions are drawn by the vertical arrows ; the horizontal arrows designate the wave packet motion .",
    "the wave packet velocity @xmath24 and recoil time @xmath23 are found from the potential functions ( molecular curves shown in figure 1 ) as    @xmath25^{1/2 } , \\qquad \\tau_{rec}\\approx\\int\\limits^{r_0+\\delta r}_{r_0}\\,dr / v(r).\\ ] ] the distance @xmath26 is the equilibrium molecular position in the ground x state of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath27 is a maximum variance for the overlapping states , where @xmath28 is the energy of excitation ( equal to an optical frequency ) and @xmath29 being the reduced mass of @xmath1 .",
    "the variance @xmath27=@xmath30 ( with @xmath31 ) for the ground state is more than it for focused b wave packet on the inner molecular wall .",
    "furthermore , if its variance is disregarded , the recoil lifetime is limited below by the magnitude @xmath32 .",
    "the state b can be populated at the energy @xmath33 for a more long time than the recoil time @xmath23 .",
    "setting the gate of excitation by the typical vibrational period @xmath34 at @xmath28 , one can measure the squeezing by the ratio @xmath35 which is expected about 30 or more .",
    "as it will be clear later , even subtle details of controlling the atomic motion inside diatomic molecules can be understood by means of the classical characteristics and semiclassical distribution functions .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we apply the optimal control theory to optical polarization in the weak field response .",
    "`` a priori '' pulse shape will not be conjectured .",
    "an exact and unique solution to a maximum coherence peaked at target time is derived for isolated @xmath1 molecule in optically thin media . a time reverse ( phase cojugate ) resonance raman scattering providing for a feedback to the vibrational spreading",
    "is represented as a basic principle of the quantum control . controlling the pure and mixed states",
    "is considered . in section 3",
    "we reconcile the quantum machinery with a reasoning appealing to the classical kinematics and discuss the phase modulated field of the scattered radiation associated with the classical action of the recoiling wave packet .",
    "section 4 illustrates the general formulation by the numerical simulation . in section 5",
    "we conclude and outline the future prospects .",
    "a rigorous mathematical treatment of molecular `` magnetron '' necessitates to solve the quantum equations dealing on equal footing with vibrational motions and nonadiabatic electronic transitions .",
    "the adiabatic dynamics of a diatomic molecule is governed by hamiltonian operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the operator of radial kinetic energy , where the only active coordinate is a distance between atoms , @xmath39 and @xmath40 model the adiabatic potentials of the b and x states respectively .",
    "having the fastest vibrational motion in diatomic molecule , we neglect the more slow molecular rotations ( and the fine structure as well ) , since those transients are separated by time scales @xmath6 . for heavy molecule as @xmath1 , the vibrational",
    "transient occurs on a subpicosecond time , while the rotational transient occurs on a longer time scale of 10 ps .",
    "then , we can limit our consideration by the former , because the angular correlations happen past the vibrational ones .",
    "in fact , the rotational correction will only require a modification of the hamiltonians and averaging over initial rovibrational states . as justified in the works @xmath41 , the inclusion of the molecular rotations",
    "does not abandon the dynamic quantum control of vibrational wave packet towards a desired goal .    throughout this paper the condon approximation for dipole transition moment @xmath42 is used , with @xmath42 being independent of internuclear separation in molecule .",
    "this assumption is valid for the weak field quantum control , when the molecular ground state is being well localized .",
    "the electronic states are coupled by the electric dipole operator @xmath43 , where the laser field is @xmath44 and its slow envelop @xmath45 of allocated duration @xmath46 is to be found under a constrain limiting the pulse energy , @xmath47 this laser field should prepare the molecular transition to a desired goal .",
    "let optical dipole target be a linear superposition of weighted dirac @xmath48-like envelopes shifted on @xmath49 , @xmath50 the wisdom of that representation to the resonance coherence will be obvious further .    the schrdinger equation for the wave functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 reads as @xmath53 the empty b state and populated ground x state ( at zero temperature ) will be of use as our initial condition @xmath54 . also , the rotating wave approximation is utilized in eq ( 3 ) to avoid fast oscillations of optical frequency of the b - x transition .",
    "then , the resonance interaction is given by the slow amplitude @xmath55 .",
    "our objective consists in controlling the polarization , @xmath56 which in its turn manifests in the molecular optical susceptibility .",
    "the first correction to the transition dipole moment @xmath57 in the weak field regime is @xmath58 to characterize the molecular transition , it is useful to extract a temporal structure factor independing of the excitation field envelope @xmath59 . for this goal",
    "we introduce a wave - packet correlation function as @xmath60 this formula describes the optical polarization caused by the @xmath48-like pulse of electric field @xmath61 .",
    "modulation of the b - x transitions is formed while the @xmath62 replica propagates on the b curve .",
    "the bound wave packet oscillates spreading between turning points and permits the molecule to radiate the raman scattering signal . in frequency domain ,",
    "the erratic spectral pattern @xmath63 of the resonance raman intensity is accordingly observed .",
    "the spectral profile of the @xmath64 correlator is represented by the khd formula for the fundamental raman overtone .",
    "its resonance dependence is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the damping constant ; the eigenstates @xmath67 and eigenleveles @xmath68 can be found from eigenequation @xmath69 .",
    "the stokes overtones are manifested when the wave packet reaches a favorable position to overlap the vibrational x states .",
    "@xmath70    to maximize the overlap between the franck - condon density @xmath71 and optical dipole target @xmath72 , we define the field functional as @xmath73 one should note , that given functional does not confine the optical polarization throughout the time . however , it does guarantee a maximal dipole moment at our objective @xmath72 .",
    "the frank - condon transitions develop freely beyond the target time constrained only by the field energy in eq 1 .",
    "the dynamic quantum control begins with the x state @xmath62 , which is tightly localized in the i - i distance at the start .",
    "the b state must be optimally driven below the dissociation limit to avoid bound - free transitions resulting in losses .",
    "evident wave nature will impede the control , in which the b wave packet having undamped oscillation between turning points , must be focused on the inner steep core with a maximum velocity at target time .",
    "those requirements will be met under a global maximum of the field functional @xmath74 .",
    "this condition is set by small variation of the probe field @xmath75 in the variational equation , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the langrange multiplier enabling to enforce the energy constrain .",
    "herefrom the basic problem of dynamic quantum control in the weak field regime reduces to the fredholm eigenequation , @xmath78 where the kernel of the homogeneous equation is given by the complex hermitian matrix , @xmath79 the integral kernel @xmath80 depends exclusively on a chosen dipole target and specification of the electronic transition being a pump - independent in the weak field limit . in some sense , it copies the material properties of the molecule to a light field .",
    "the time - dependent matrix elements eq ( 5 ) forming the kernel in eq ( 9 ) have long been known in the `` matter - radiation '' interaction theory , benefited to understanding nonlinear optics and utilized in quantum control of wave packets with different material objectives : the minimum space variance of wave packets ( i.s.averbukh , m.shapiro @xmath81 ) , the delta - like space density target ( v.dubov , h.rabitz @xmath82 ) , the minimum quantum uncertainty state ( k.r.wilson et al .",
    "@xmath22 ) .    to recall their argumentation",
    ", we shall take a quick look at another field functional , which describes a total b population in the weak field regime , @xmath83 where the self - conjugate kernel @xmath84 in eq 5 is proportional to the @xmath64-correlator depending on the difference argument @xmath85 , because the molecular potentials are independent of time @xmath86 again one can repeat above steps searching a global maximum for the functional @xmath87 , which gives a maximum population yield per unit field energy .",
    "considering a small field variation @xmath75 for the variational equation @xmath88 , we obtain an eigenequation @xmath89 we obtain the degenerated kernel having separated the time arguments @xmath90 and @xmath91 by means of the unity decomposition @xmath92 .",
    "then , a solution to the integral equation can be cast as    @xmath93    unkno wn coefficients @xmath94 are found from the system of linear equations taken at a maximal eigenvalue @xmath95 @xmath96 the matrix @xmath97 is formed by the franck - condon factors and energy levels of the b state @xmath98    the optimal field @xmath59 depends on the oscillator strengths of the molecular transition in eq(16 ) , which includes factors of the increasing frequency due to the energy ladder @xmath99 of vibrational levels .",
    "this field must steadily populate the molecular states .",
    "it is expedient to put on the textbook condon s model of the molecular transition between the parabolic curve @xmath100 and flat continuum @xmath101 , where the s - correlator is the following :    @xmath102 the phase profile @xmath103 is provided by the spreading wave packet in continuum which is projected to the ground vibrational state . on using a slope molecular curve @xmath104 models the repulsive franck - condon region and recoiling wave packet .",
    "the phase correction @xmath105 is explicitly derived in the model dealing with the momentum representation of wave packet dynamics .",
    "the amplitude correction turns out to be of gaussian type and like the debye - waller factor is given by the ratio of the recoil energy @xmath106 to vibrational quantum @xmath107 , i.e.    @xmath108 the flat and slope continuum of molecular states provide for the kernel @xmath109 with negative chirp of frequency for a short time duration @xmath91 , when the expansion in the power of @xmath91 is legitimate .",
    "the conclusion holds also in a general picture of semiclassical approximation as demonstrated in next section .",
    "thus , a short pulse having positive frequency chirp slows down the fast integrand oscillations in eq ( 13 ) enabling one to maximize its eigenvalue , ( i.e. the yield of the population ) .",
    "the maximum population has to involve a gain of fluorescence.@xmath110    other trends of wave packet correlations make it possible to control a selected molecular state or coherent transients . according to eq 9 , a top eigenvalue @xmath77 gives a maximum optical dipole transition per unit of field energy having eigenvector @xmath111 as the globally optimal field of the allocated duration @xmath46 . to demonstrate this statement we address the @xmath112-dirac model as the simplest optical dipole target , where the coherent envelope @xmath113 will be peaked at time @xmath114 after turning off the excitation pulse .",
    "the condition @xmath115 means , that the `` spontaneous '' polarization will stand out on the pulse - free background .",
    "the delta - like target model results in the degenerate fredholm kernel .",
    "an unique solution to the integral equation is explicitly written as    @xmath116    where @xmath114 marks a moment when the optical polarization is regained with @xmath77 being the normalized coherent yield , @xmath117 the indication of optimality according to bellman principle is indeed realized : the control depends on the state of system at the current moment alone .",
    "this globally optimal fields can be understood in general terms , for their envelopes @xmath111 match those of the wave packet correlations representing the time - reversed resonance scattering .",
    "the delay time @xmath118 fits an absolute maximum of the optical transient to target time @xmath119 .",
    "the dipole transition moment is given by the convolution integral    @xmath120    the optimal field in eqs 17 , 19 cancels out the fast oscillating behaviour of the integrand as being designed to have the phase conjugate wave - packet correlations excited by the @xmath48-like pulse .",
    "the optical transient by virtue of eq 19 exhibits periodical recurrences , having the maximum magnitude @xmath121 exactly at the target time @xmath118",
    ".    the straightforward extension of the @xmath48-dipole target to the realistic shape @xmath72 specifies an eigenvalue problem in eq 9 .",
    "the integral operator @xmath80 can be decomposed into sum of the degenerate kernels according to eq 10 in the weak field limit .",
    "the solution is @xmath122 where the @xmath123 being the eigenstate at a top eigenvalue of the system @xmath124 the matrix coefficients are given by , @xmath125 so that the optimal field satisfies the energy constrain by the definition .",
    "we have established an important fact , which merits to be reformulated as a reversibility theorem asserting sufficient conditions to reverse the spread wave packet in time : _ in order to drive molecular transition to the polarization target @xmath72 , the optimal field should be made of superimposed phase conjugate fields of the resonance raman scattering of ultrashort pulses of amplitudes @xmath126 at the delay time @xmath127 .",
    "_    the resonance scattering radiation itself may seem to be `` erratic '' in time .",
    "the wave - packet collapse and spreading and destructive interference are responsible for the apparent noise due to molecular `` disorder '' on account of potential anharmonicity , uncommensurate frequencies , curve crossing etc . but",
    "phase conjugate feedback with respect to molecular correlations ( resonant scattering ) allows the wave packet to be recovered at a fixed space - time point at will .",
    "the optical coherence can be restored not only for the raman fundamental overtone .",
    "our treatment might be readly extended to controlling the high overtones of molecular resonance scattering .",
    "we term the field enabling to squeeze the optical coherence as a quantum hologram to note its key role for a wave packet interference in the franck - condon region .",
    "the quantum holography is relying on the wave packet correlations , which can be found by detecting a fluorescence or population created by two phase locked ultrashort pulses .",
    "accordingly , in the limit of weak field , the excited state b is obtained from eq 3 , in the first order to the resonance interaction as , @xmath128 this superposition is obvious analog of an incident and object waves in optical holography .",
    "to produce the quantum interference of wave packets , the first laser pulse at @xmath129 must be followed by the delayed pulse at @xmath130 . if the laser pulses are phase - locked and their areas are small with respect to @xmath131 , the population @xmath132 of the state b contains the contribution @xmath133 of the one photon two - pulse interference , i.e. @xmath134 the alternative pathways in course of the franck - condon transitions depend on the delay time @xmath135 between pulses .",
    "this dependence is being just required to controlling the wave packet motion .",
    "the phase locked laser pulses must retrieve synphase and quadrature components of the @xmath136 correlator .",
    "the lif signal @xmath133 , ionization channel @xmath137 , or other means for the matter - wave interferometry may be employed .",
    "then , the use of programmable optics @xmath138 and algorithms based on the reversibility theorem fed into computer codes can be made to tailor the optimal field .",
    "this quantum holography program must be realized to rebuild the well localized replica of the ground state or to squeeze optical coherence as called on even for unknown molecular curves as well as collisional or intramolecular dephasing and relaxation .",
    "the reversibility theorem still holds for mixed states inevitably residing in statistical systems , for which irreversible processes hamper the quantum control of the wave packets . by considering the nondiagonal density matrix of the resonance transition @xmath139 , the brackets @xmath140 symbolize an ensemble averaging in quantum kinetic theory",

    "experiments in solids , liquids and gas cell conditions indicate an existences of coherent vibrational transients of @xmath1 to tens of picoseconds @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the quantum control theory within the matrix density formalism , in which the relaxation will not be scrutinized further , may be applied .    just as for pure states , we take care of the optical polarization @xmath149 at target time .",
    "one can immediately maximize the overlap between the optical transition @xmath150 and its dipole target in eq 2 . by letting the polarization operator",

    "the merit of the average density valid for all paths , having the quantum spreading fixed by the initial distribution , is evident at the caustic and turning points . here",
    ", the zeroth derivative @xmath220 provides for the concentration of the classical paths , for which the van vleck s determinats diverge @xmath221 .",
    "however , our determinantal relation still remains to be a good solution for the quantum amplitude .",
    "it is necessary to look more closely at the semiclassical recipe to gain insight about a frequency modulation of wave - packet correlations .",
    "the @xmath64-correlator is written as a trace of the polarization density matrix , see also eq 30 , @xmath222 with initial condition @xmath223 , a solution formally satisfies to @xmath224 the transport equation for the nondiagonal matrix element @xmath225 is immediately obtained with accuracy @xmath226 to be sure containing the description of quantum interference on the franck - condon transition : @xmath227 the difference potential @xmath228 defines corresponding resonant frequencies .",
    "an average potential is the half sum of the molecular curves @xmath229 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath230 so that , the @xmath64-correlations are represented as an integral of local density with fast oscillating exponential prefactor in the space @xmath203 given by the expression , @xmath231 at the start , the function @xmath232 has a quite simple shape of gaussian distribution .",
    "its contour lines look like the stretched ellipses .",
    "then , the map exhibits a complicated topology due to winding motion around a minimum of the average potential and its anharmonicity . together with the fast oscillating functional for the difference potential of the b - x states",
    ", it presents a challenge to calculating the trace integral representation for topological singularities of the turning point structure which is common for the semiclassical approximations of wave mechanics @xmath233 .",
    "the solution to our problem is written down in langrange coordinates @xmath234 . by virtue of liouville theorem ,",
    "the phase volume in the jacobian transformation from euler to lagrange variables is invariant , whilst molecular potentials are independent of velocity . in the langrange picture",
    "@xmath235 the basic integrand becomes a function of r , p @xmath236 to expand the path functional @xmath237 in the exponent to the second order in departures from the point @xmath211 , we use a series    @xmath238    where @xmath239 and the path @xmath240 obeys eq 45 .",
    "by re - using the vector and matrix notation again , one can represent the final expression as a two - dimensional gaussian integral ,    @xmath241    where the vector @xmath242 and matrix @xmath243 are given by @xmath244 the phase modulation is set by the function @xmath245 .",
    "additional corrections in the exponent are responsible also for the decay amplitude giving generalized debye - waller factors for wave packet recoiling .",
    "the phase and amplitude formulae may be simplified due to peculiar features of molecular curves , short times evolution etc .",
    "this approach would be of interest to address landau - ziner transitions , and the spectral lines structure from impact center to static wings may be uniformly exploited .",
    "an analytical formulation of the globally optimal fields has some advantage of being used to model the molecular wave packet correlations .",
    "on propagating in a space the laser pulse might be tailormade to mimic the known optimal fields . with this aim the high frequency filtering in optical guides , nonlinear frequency dispersion , reflection from holographic film , gratings etc . giving the right temporal and spectral trends",
    "may be adapted to perform the quantum control .    as an example",
    ", we will discuss a chirping in static wing of spectral molecular line .",
    "accessed by the ultrashort pulse , the wave packet develops in the average potential @xmath246 between points connected by the direct path . for a small @xmath90 ( a femtosecond scale ) , these points are close together on the trajectory @xmath247 the difference potential in eq 46 can be expanded for the small departures from the equilibrium point @xmath211 , and we may rewrite the frequency in @xmath248 as a power series for a small @xmath90 @xmath249 since the condition @xmath250 ( zero force ) should be met in @xmath251 ( at a minimum of x curve ) , the result is the quadratic chirp lowering the pulse frequency with a correction coefficient of 0.25 to its classical rate in eq 34 .",
    "the correction of this sort is not surprising for the classical - semiclassical - quantum correspondence .",
    "moreover , considering more closely the phase and amplitude modulation of wave packet correlations resulted from @xmath252 in eq 49 , one can find additional corrections due to recoil from the slope molecular curve .",
    "the first non - vanishing terms of the power @xmath90 and @xmath253 in the exponent are an exact match the quantum formulae in the condon model ( see sec .",
    "ii after eq 16 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that the wave packet is found in the coherent superposition of two resonance states , i.e. b and x , and their mixing will reduce the chirp rate on the classically gained formula in eq 34 , because the molecular force acts only through the curve b ( in recoiling from the inner curve ) , and does not in the equilibrium point of curve x.    this argumentation must be revised further for returning trajectories on a long time duration . in the case ,",
    "our uniform treatment warrants a more careful study that will be reported elsewhere . for completeness",
    "sake , the basic ideas of quantum control should be examined in a quantum simulation , which is favored to the semiclassical treatment , if one can not limit by one classical path .",
    "thus , in the next section , we shall rely on the quantum computation leaving aside a detailed numerical analysis of the classical equations .",
    "the quantum model eq 3 for the motion along one active i - i coordinate and electronic transition belongs to the polynomial class of numerical complexity of @xmath132 linear equations , where n is the number of grid points .",
    "there is more that one recipe with which to perform their computations @xmath254 .",
    "the qr diagonalization requires the @xmath255 operations . in specific cases , the qr algorithm , as a stable spectral decomposition ,",
    "can be used for the wave packet propagation .",
    "the time implicit symmetrical schemes of gaussian elimination @xmath256 necessitate @xmath257 operations . the symmetrized split operator method does @xmath258 steps based on the fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xmath259 .",
    "the fft propagates the wave packet similar to feynman s path integral and alternates the coordinate and momentum representations involving the thorough dynamical picture in hand .",
    "these methods are in good agreement .",
    "the practical value of ffts or gaussian elimination is that they enable to get rid of the matrix diagonalization .",
    "the absorbing boundary condition has been used in the numerical simulations .",
    "the imaginary negative optical potential discriminates the outgoing wave packet at outer edge of the numerical grid and has no effect on the bound states .",
    "this feature is visible in figure 2 , where the molecular dynamics following impact resonance interaction on b - x transition is shown .",
    "the ground state replica transforms into a wave - packet which is scattering above the molecular dissociation limit and binding below it .",
    "the scattering states , shown in the foreground of figure 2 , are involved due to impact photodissociation ( i.e. , the @xmath48-like pulse action ) .",
    "this branch is not mixed with the bound - bound transitions responsible for coherent recurrences , while the wave packet recoils against the molecular walls and oscillates spreading for the b state anharmonicity .    the resonance scattering radiation in the wake of ultrashort pulse proceeds in two stages : a fast monotonic decay due to direct photodissociation gives way to a `` non - regular '' reviving .",
    "this picture is shown in figure 3 for the fundamental overtone of raman intensity . since a damping out",
    "is assumed to be small , the wave packet correlations hold during many molecular periods",
    ". the amplitude and phase profile will follow in reverse order .",
    "thus , figure 3 showing its fundamental overtone intensity must be read `` from right to left '' . the phase conjugate scattering signal in figure 4(a )",
    "has been designed to drive the spread waves towards @xmath118 .",
    "the target time @xmath118 exactly represents the starting point of wave - packet correlations .",
    "furthermore , on going back in time their envelope @xmath260 is not delta correlating as a white noise signal .",
    "there are two regular trends : the negative frequency chirp , which has been explained with the semiclassical arguments , and amplitude growing to the pulse end .",
    "the last feature stemmed from the reversibility theorem can be also understood qualitatively .",
    "since the wave packet is spreading between turning points , the result is a small amplitude almost everywhere in the classically accessible franck - condon region .",
    "the optimal field on its start is set by a projection of the spread wave packet to the x state .",
    "the s - correlations undergo fast oscillations due to multiple recoils of the wave packet against molecular walls and its spreading accompanied by decreasing amplitude . evolving back in time ,",
    "the wave packet becomes more regular , and its shape is recovered and copies well localized replica of the ground x state .",
    "focussing the wave packet in the vicinity of the inner turning point results in a further rise of its amplitude .",
    "the projection to the ground x state grows together .",
    "this explains why the globally optimal field behaves in such a way in figure 4(a ) .",
    "induced resonance transient given by eq 4 is shown in figure 4(b ) .",
    "the 1 ps square gate of optimal field creates the transient spike at delay time 1.5 ps .",
    "the temporal full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equals @xmath261 fs that is in good agreement with the kinematical overlap lifetime @xmath262 .",
    "this semiclassical estimate is astonishingly accurate although less then quantum computed .",
    "there are two main reasons of this distinction .",
    "the wave packet interference is absent in the classical kinematics and the dispersion of excited state is not taken into account .",
    "thus , the ignorance of quantum wave nature underestimates the width of the coherent peak . to cure the situation , the semiclassical uniform approach , which copes with initial quantum distribution , classical motions , caustic and turning points ,",
    "may be applied .",
    "for definiteness sake , setting @xmath263 fs square gate of optical target @xmath264 at the delay time 1.5 ps , we now can consider a realistic optical transient .",
    "averaging the globally optimal envelope over @xmath264 washes out the high frequency components as shown in figure 5 .",
    "however , the average pulse shape is yet endowed with a chirp .",
    "this feature is exhibited in figure 6 ( a ) , where wigner spectrogram is shown .",
    "the wigner function of the optimal fields is defined as @xmath265 picosecond square gate envelope and periodic boundary condition have been used in evaluating the spectrograms .",
    "the frequency - time maps manifest a striking correlation between the optimal fields and wave packet evolution .",
    "for instance , the envelop of allocated duration @xmath266 consists of more shorten subpulses .",
    "their number is associated with the number of vibrational cycles between turning points during @xmath46 . for every recoiling from inner molecular core",
    "the wave packet gives rise to a subpulse .",
    "the contour levels of the two - dimensional wigner spectrogram are taken at one - half a maximum height .",
    "a slope and concavity characterizes respectively a linear and quadratic frequency chirp of subpulse .",
    "the semiclassical reasoning relate the chirping to wave packet velocity and acceleration .",
    "the chirp is in fact linear because time duration of pulse @xmath267 ( in picosecond range ) is much more than the recoil lifetime @xmath268fs .",
    "thus , the wave - packet is far from turning points and does not accelerate most of the time .",
    "the spectral fwhm in figure 6 ( a ) is about @xmath269 being consistent with the reciprocity relation @xmath270 @xmath271 .",
    "a minor decoherence of the objective as shown in figure 6b is obtained in our numerical simulation .",
    "the temporal fwhm is about 60 fs being 10 fs over the square gate target width @xmath263 fs . the distinction stems from the wave packets quantum dispersion .",
    "the wave packet dynamics is displayed in figure 7 and figure 8 .",
    "the resonance frequency is @xmath272 above the ground x term ; the excitation bandwidth is about @xmath273 ( fwhm ) .",
    "thus , the wave packet b is created below the molecular continuum to spread from @xmath274 to @xmath275 not far from its dissociation limit .",
    "given intensity of transitions , the depopulation of state x is involved to the pulse end , although the x state localization is not affected at the saturation .",
    "the optical transient rises and falls , following the wave packet recoils from the inner core .",
    "the spatial variance of a maximum focused wave packet at target time reaches 0.04 @xmath276 , being slightly less than the original localization in agreement with our qualitative reasoning .",
    "the result is robust to slow sinusoidal or gaussian aberrations of optimal fields and akin to known stability of phase conjugate fields due to the wave speckle structure @xmath277 .",
    "the numerous possible applications in femtosecond spectroscopy are rested on the concept of coherence .",
    "the proceedings of femtochemistry iii conference in lund testify ( see the special issue of the journal of physical chemistry ) , that this realm of knowledge is flourishing and another lines of researches have now been opened . as an example we refer the field of deemed quantum computers@xmath278 . here",
    ", controllable coherence of logic gates could boost performance of massive parallel computation exponentially with number of quantum nodes .",
    "these nodes may be constituted from clusters or single molecules and their resonance optical transitions must act in concert with vibrational wave packets captured by `` molecular cavities '' .",
    "a run stage of a quantum computer , its coherence may not be affected by environment @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the danger of dephasing requires the optical coherence to be actively controlled according to a state - mapping protocol . from this point of view",
    ", the reversibility theorem stated in our paper exemplifies a paradigm of controllability expected for wave packets dynamics and optical transients .",
    "in fact , the fundamental connection between physical laws and computations based on time reversable hamiltonians has been addressed yet by r.feynman @xmath280 .",
    "the computational quantum networks requires the reversable transmission among distant nodes @xmath281 .",
    "the central aim of this paper is to set a globally optimal solution to a maximum squeezing the optical coherence of a single molecule .",
    "the sufficient conditions of recovering coherence have been stated in the reversibility theorem .",
    "our time reversed fields have been tested in the model computation of @xmath1 b - x transition confirming effeciency of the phase conjugate resonant raman scattering for quantum control .",
    "the result is not limited only to diatomic molecules in gas or condensed states , but is valid for the quantum control of electron wave packets as well @xmath282 .",
    "the four - wave mixing interaction and related stimulated raman emission is deserving of mention .",
    "these optical transients would make it possible to automate the quantum control to be held both for bound states and molecular continuum .",
    "to take one example , ultrashort transform limited pulses driving bound - free transitions result in the photon echo of photodissociation @xmath283 , to mean an automated controlling wave packet motion .",
    "photon echoes @xmath21 imply that dynamical holograms are written on resonance franck - condon transitions . but",
    "it takes more strong laser fields to induce at least the third order nonlinear polarization .",
    "a self - adaptive `` quantum mirror '' has been devised @xmath284 to reverse wave evolution on curing the optical aberrations of a noise wave front propagated trough inhomogenious media .",
    "moreover we have seen that the phase cojugate ( time - reverse ) raman scattering negates also delocalization of molecular wave packets .",
    "the use of the phase conjugate signals presents an intriguing illustration of how the original quantum state is restored in the matter - wave interferometry .",
    "an uniform semiclassical formula has been derived for the optimal field envelop .",
    "the simple estimates are contrasted with quantum simulation .",
    "we conclude that femtosecond coherence of a single molecule must exist in varied conditions ( even on resonant transitions saturated to the pulse end ) .",
    "robustness of our molecular magnetron design has been demonstrated also .",
    "we propose to test experimentally the molecular magnetron design verifying the quantum holography directly on observing delayed sparks of femtosecond fluorescence which is excited by a more long picosecond pulse in optically thin sample .",
