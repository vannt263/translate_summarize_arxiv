    "the modeling of nonlinear propagation in optical fibers is a key component in the efficient design of fiber - optic communications .",
    "although computer simulations have long reached a state of maturity allowing very accurate prediction of system performance , their use is prohibitively complex in many cases of relevance , where approximate analytical models become invaluable . in a wavelength division multiplexed ( wdm ) environment ,",
    "nonlinear propagation phenomena can be classified as either intra - channel @xcite , or inter - channel @xcite effects .",
    "intra - channel effects manifest themselves as nonlinear inter - symbol interference , which can in principle be eliminated by means of post - processing ( such as back - propagation @xcite ) , or pre - distortion @xcite .",
    "inter - channel effects consist of cross - phase - modulation ( xpm ) and four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) between wdm channels , and in a complex network environment , where joint processing is prohibitively complex , distortions due to inter - channel effects are random and it is customary to treat them as noise .",
    "the chief goal of analytical models of fiber propagation is to accurately characterize this noise in terms of its statistical properties .    while early attempts of characterizing the properties of nonlinear interference noise ( nlin ) in the context of fiber - communications date back to the previous millennium @xcite , two recent analytical approaches are of particular relevance to this paper .",
    "the first approach , which relies on analysis in the spectral domain , originated from the group of p. poggiolini at the politecnico di torino @xcite and its derivation has been recently generalized by johannisson and karlsson @xcite and by bononi and serena @xcite .",
    "the model generated by this approach is commonly referred to as the gaussian noise ( gn ) model and its implications have already started to be addressed in a number of studies @xcite . the second approach has been reported by mecozzi and essiambre @xcite , and it is based on a time - domain analysis .",
    "the results of the latter approach @xcite are distinctly different from those of the former @xcite .",
    "most conspicuously , in the results of @xcite , the nlin is treated as additive gaussian noise and its power - spectrum is totally independent of modulation format .",
    "conversely , the theory of mecozzi et al . predicts a strong dependence of the nlin variance on the modulation format , consistently with recent experimental observations @xcite .",
    "it also predicts that in the presence of non - negligible intensity modulation a large fraction of nlin can be characterized as phase noise .",
    "this property has a very important practical consequence .",
    "if nlin indeed has a large phase - noise component , as argued in @xcite , then it can be canceled out easily by making use of its long temporal correlation @xcite , and the effective nlin becomes much weaker than suggested by its overall variance .",
    "the consequences of this reality in terms of the predicted channel capacity have been recently studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we review the essential parts of the time - domain theory of @xcite , as well as those of the frequency domain gn approach .",
    "we argue that the difference between the two models results from three subtle , but very important shortcomings of the frequency domain analysis .",
    "the first is the implicit assumption that nlin can be treated as additive noise , while ignoring its statistical dependence on the data in the channel of interest . while it is true that within the framework of a perturbation analysis nlin can always be expressed as an additive noise term , its dependence on the channel of interest is critical . in the case of phase noise , for example",
    ", the signal of interest @xmath4 changes into @xmath5 , and the noise @xmath6 may be uncorrelated with @xmath4 , but it is certainly not statistically independent of it .",
    "the second shortcoming of the frequency domain approach is the assumption that in the limit of large chromatic dispersion the electric field of the signal and the nlin that accompanies it can be treated as a gaussian processes whose distribution is uniquely characterized in terms of its power density spectrum . the third shortcoming that we find in the gn analysis , is the claim that non overlapping frequency components of the propagating electric field are statistically independent of each other .",
    "we show here that these components are statistically dependent in general and it is the assumption of independence that is responsible for the fact that the nlin in @xcite appears to be independent of modulation format .",
    "we supplement the nlin variance obtained in the frequency domain analysis of @xcite with an extra term that follows from fourth - order frequency correlations and which , as we believe , settles the discrepancy with respect to the time - domain theory of @xcite .",
    "the study contained in this paper was performed only for the case of single carrier transmission , where xpm constitutes the predominant contribution to nlin , a fact which is confirmed by our simulations .",
    "for this reason the analytical parts of this paper focus exclusively on xpm .",
    "moreover , in order to isolate only the nlin caused by inter - channel nonlinear interference , we back propagate the channel of interest so as to eliminate the distortions that are induced by spm and chromatic dispersion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tda ]",
    "we review the main analytical steps of @xcite , occasionally recasting them in a form that emphasizes the aspects of most relevance to this paper , and supplement them by the calculation of the autocorrelation function of the nonlinear phase - noise @xcite .",
    "we then review the spectral approach in section [ sda ] and explain the consequences of the assumptions on gaussianity and statistical independence that were made in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] we describe a numerical study that validates the analytical prediction of secs .",
    "[ tda ] and [ sda ] . section [ discussion ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "we consider a channel of interest , whose central frequency is arbitrarily set to zero , and a single interfering channel whose central frequency is set to @xmath7 .",
    "since xpm only involves two - channel interactions , the nlin contributions of multiple wdm channels add up independently , and there is no need to conduct the initial analysis with more than a single pair . we also ignore nonlinear interactions that involve amplified spontaneous emission noise , which are negligible within the framework of a perturbation analysis such as we are conducting here . while a second - order analysis such as in @xcite is possible in principle , we find the first - order approach sufficiently accurate in the context of the study conducted here . as a starting point",

    "most importantly , the simulations in @xcite do not eliminate intra - channel effects through back - propagation , as we do here , but use adaptive equalization , which may leave some of the intra - channel interference uncompensated .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the phase - noise that we report ( which is characterized by a very long temporal correlation ) is inadvertently eliminated in the process of adaptive equalization .",
    "additionally , some of the discrepancy could result from the fact that the system simulated in @xcite assumed lumped amplification , as opposed to distributed amplification that we assumed here .",

    "[ chi12]b include the contribution of phase - noise , the relation to the error - rate is not straightforward .",
    "having reviewed the essential parts of the time domain model and the frequency domain gn model , we have pointed out that the difference between the models results from three unjustified assumptions in the frequency domain approach .",
    "the assumption that nlin can be described as an additive noise term that is statistically independent on the signal , the assumption that in the large dispersion limit the electric field of the signal and the noise forms a gaussian process that is uniquely characterized in terms of its spectrum , and the claim of statistical independence between non - overlapping tones in the spectrum of the interfering signal .",
    "we have shown that by correctly accounting for fourth - order correlations in the signals spectrum an extra term  the fon  arises .",
    "the fon ( which can be positive , or negative depending on the modulation format ) needs to be added to the noise power obtained in the gn model ( the son ) in order to obtain the correct overall nlin .",
    "the inclusion of the fon recovers the dependence of the nlin power on modulation format , a property that is absent from the existing gn model and reconciles between the frequency domain and the time domain theories .",
    "we stress that the current gn model of @xcite which does not contain the fon term , can not be considered a valid approximation , since with standard modulation formats ( e.g qpsk , 16-qam ) , the magnitude of the fon is comparable to that of the son , which is the quantity calculated in @xcite .",
    "the numerical validation of the theoretical results has been performed in the case of a five - channel wdm system with idealized distributed amplification . in this case",
    "the fon term was almost identical to the son term , implying that the error in the nlin power predicted by the gn model is very significant .",
    "while the study presented in this paper focused on the single polarization case , the effect of polarization multiplexing can be be anticipated by considering the relevant factors . the son part of the nlin variance changes in the presence of polarization multiplexing by a factor of 16/27 @xcite , whereas it can be shown that the fon part changes by 40/81 .",
    "the small difference between these factors has practically no effect on the conclusions made in this paper regarding the importance of accounting for fon .",
    "the numerical study of polarization multiplexed transmission , as well as the effects of lumped amplifications and the many other practical system parameters , is beyond the scope of this work and will be addressed in the future .",
    "finally , we note that when treating the nlin as an additive , signal - independent noise process , its bandwidth appears to be comparable to that of the signal itself .",
    "thus , one can not take advantage of the fact that phase noise that dominates the variance of nlin in many cases of interest is very narrow - band as we have shown here ( see eq .",
    "( [ acftheta2 ] ) and fig . [ acftheta ] ) .",
    "the importance of this property of nlin is immense as it allows cancelation of the phase - noise part of nlin by means of available equalization technology @xcite , such that the residual nlin ( whose variance is much smaller than that of the nlin as a whole ) determines system performance .",
    "the system consequences of this reality have been addressed in @xcite .",
