    "if @xmath231 and @xmath232 are negative , then the fluid is unstable with respect to clumping . to see this",

    ", entropy scales with particle number @xmath237 , and so @xmath238 where from above , @xmath239 is the energy density , and @xmath240 is the specific entropy , which is a function of temperature but not particle number .",

    "this result can be extended to singular @xmath101 as well .",
    "to study local stability , it is enough to consider the equation of motion in a small neighborhood of a given point @xmath290 .",
    "in such a neighborhood , we can ignore spacetime dependence of @xmath291 and solve the equation in terms of fourier modes with momenta @xmath292 .",

    "since @xmath96 and @xmath285 are of the same sign definiteness , the matrix @xmath294 can be positive definite , and therefore the model is ghost - free , only if @xmath287 .",
    "then , from the previous section , the combined requirement that the model be both causal and ghost - free can be satisfied only if @xmath286 and @xmath287 .    )",
    "are all determined by the sign - definiteness of matrices @xmath101 and @xmath96 .",
    "the nec holds for @xmath286 ; the model is causal for @xmath280 and ghost - free for @xmath287 .",
    "a model is ghost - free and causal only if it obeys the nec.,width=226 ]    from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath296 it follows that the nec is equivalent to @xmath297 .",

    "we see that nec violation and the absence of ghost instability imply non - causal behavior for this model .",
