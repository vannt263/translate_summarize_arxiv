    "resolving the ly@xmath0 forest in he  2347 - 4342 with fuse @xcite has led to a detailed picture of the ionization if the igm . the cosmic uv background which governs the / column density ratio",
    "was found to fluctuate by at least two orders of magnitude , with the highest values observed in the low density part ( voids ) of the ly@xmath0 forest @xcite .",
    "we present here fuse observations of hs  1700 + 6416 ( @xmath5 ) , a second line of sight of comparable quality .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in tab . [ observations ] .",
    "the data reduction of the fuse spectrum was performed by g. kriss .",
    "the wavelength range of the ly@xmath0 forest is covered by two keck / hires spectra @xcite .",
    "we coadd these two datasets .",
    "the simcoe spectrum reaches down to 3200 so this portion is used as well for the analysis of the metal line systems along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , we have stis data from the hst archive , taken with the echelle e140 m grating .",
    "because of their low signal - to - noise ratio only the best part of the spectrum is used for consistency checks constraining the models of the metal line systems .",
    ".summary of the observations . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     datasets published in @xcite and @xcite    [ observations ]    to estimate the continuum in the fuse portion we have taken low resolution hst / stis data in may 2003 .",
    "the covered wavelength range ( 1150  3200 ) includes an overlap with the fuse data , where the two spectra match despite the uv variability of the qso .",
    "we extrapolate the continuum from the stis data correcting for extinction , the seven lls , and considering the intrinsic qso power law continuum .",
    "we derive models for 18 metal line systems with redshifts in the range of @xmath6 using the photoionization code cloudy @xcite . a haardt ",
    "madau uv background at the appropriate redshifts @xcite serves as ionizing radiation field in most of the cases .",
    "three systems require a power law continuum .",
    "the ionization parameter is fixed on the basis of column density ratios of two ionization stages of at least two different elements .",
    "metallicities and relative abundances are scaled to match the observed column densities . using this procedure we describe the observed column densities and get a prediction for the distribution of metal lines in the fuse wavelength range . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] some rather strong features can be identified with metal lines .",
    "we fit all absorbers with doppler profiles and model the corresponding features at the same redshifts assuming pure turbulent broadening . if necessary , we add lines without counterpart .",
    "the result for the column density ratio @xmath7 , taking into account the metal line prediction , is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the distribution resembles the result of he  2347 - 4342 .",
    "the consideration metal absorption lines has no dramatic influence on the result in comparison to a simple model , even though 13.5% of the features would have been biased by metal lines .",
    "the average value @xmath8 decreases by @xmath9 17% and we have to add 7% less lines without counterpart .",
    "the average column density ratio @xmath10 corresponds to a haardt ",
    "madau ionizing background , but individual values are in a range from @xmath11 to more than 1000 , which implies highly fluctuating ionization conditions .",
    "furthermore , we confirm the correlation between column density and @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right panel ) as found in previous studies @xcite , where weak absorbers have high @xmath7-values .",
