    "_ in situ _ measurements of solar wind turbulence consistently show one dimensional magnetic energy spectra that obey a broken power law , typically having spectral indices @xmath2 in the inertial range and steepening in the dissipation range @xcite .",

    "although measurements of the magnetic energy spectrum are common , the spectrum alone does not provide direct insight into the nature of solar wind fluctuations . since the solar wind turbulence is electromagnetic",
    ", the expectation is that the solar wind fluctuations will exhibit characteristics of the three basic electromagnetic plasma wave modes at the large scales of the inertial range : alfvn , fast magnetosonic , and slow magnetosonic @xcite .",
    "similarly , the dissipation range is expected to be populated by the kinetic scale counterparts of the three wave modes .    based upon a variety of metrics",
    ", the alfvn mode appears to be the dominant wave mode in the inertial range @xcite .",
    "the composition of solar wind fluctuations in the dissipation range is less well constrained due to the dearth of high frequency measurements in the free solar wind necessary to probe this region , but recent observations suggest the kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) is the dominant mode in the free solar wind @xcite  the kaw is the dissipation range extension of the inertial range alfvn wave in the @xmath7 region of wavenumber space , where parallel and perpendicular are with respect to the local mean magnetic field , @xmath8 .",
    "one of the commonly used metrics is the magnetic variance anisotropy ( @xmath0 ) , first introduced by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 is a measure of the fluctuation anisotropy and has come to be defined as @xmath9 , where angle brackets indicate averages , the @xmath10 are fluctuating quantities about the local mean magnetic field , and @xmath11 is the total energy in the plane perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field .",
    "it is important to not confuse this quantity with the wavevector anisotropy inherent to and often discussed in plasma turbulence : the wavevector anisotropy and the @xmath0 are not directly related quantities @xcite .",
    "physically , the @xmath0 can be viewed as a measure of the magnetic compressibility of the plasma , @xmath12 , since @xmath13 .",
    "the version of the @xmath0 first introduced by @xcite has been expanded upon in recent papers using the @xmath0 defined above , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we attempt here to provide a discussion that includes a theoretical basis for the interpretation of @xmath0 measurements in the solar wind . in  [ sec : waves ] , we describe in detail the expected behaviour of the @xmath0 of the three constituent electromagnetic wave modes in the solar wind inertial range and discuss their transition into the dissipation range . in  [",

    "we begin by enumerating the properties of the three linear wave modes which are the collisionless counterparts to the alfvn and fast and slow magnetosonic modes in compressible mhd @xcite . since the solar wind is a weakly collisional plasma , we focus here on the roots provided by the collisionless vlasov - maxwell ( vm ) system of equations , which are a function of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the ion ( protons only ) thermal speed . @xmath19 and @xmath20 unless otherwise stated .",

    "when the turbulence is in critical balance ",
    "i.e , the nonlinear cascade rate is of order the linear frequency  the theoretical values for @xmath29 and @xmath30 are expected to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the model of goldreich - sridhar @xcite or @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the dynamic alignment model @xcite .",
    "which model is correct is not completely settled .",
    "solar wind observations typically show a magnetic field spectrum with @xmath35 and total ( kinetic plus magnetic ) energy spectrum with @xmath36 @xcite , while mhd turbulence simulations suggest the dynamic alignment model may be more correct @xcite . for the purpose of modelling the energy cascade ,",
    "we assume the goldreich - sridhar model for simplicity .",
    "the choice of model does not significantly affect the behaviour of the @xmath0 .",
    "the properties of the mhd alfvn root are well understood .",
    "however , the mhd solution of the alfvn root is incompressible since @xmath37 , suggesting the alfvnic @xmath0 is unbounded .",
    "the full collisionless vm solution of the alfvn root in the inertial range has a small but non - vanishing @xmath38 which increases with @xmath39 , thereby causing the @xmath0 to decrease with @xmath39 .",

    "the solution assumes an inertial range spectral anisotropy as described by the goldreich - sridhar model , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the isotropic outer - scale of the turbulence and is taken to be @xmath47 , consistent with _ in situ _ solar wind measurements at @xmath48  au @xcite .",
    "continuing along the critical balance cascade to kinetic scales naturally produces spectral anisotropy with @xmath49 .",
    "so , we next consider the alfvn root with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . at these scales , the alfvn wave transitions into the kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) .",
    "the kaw is dispersive , damped , and much more compressible than the alfvn wave .",
    "the dispersive nature of the root steepens the magnetic energy spectrum to @xmath52 in the undamped case @xcite , while the inclusion of damping steepens the spectrum further @xcite .",
    "damping here refers to collisionless wave - particle interactions , primarily ion transit time damping on the parallel magnetic field that peaks at ion scales for @xmath53 @xcite and electron landau damping on the parallel electric field that peaks at electron scales @xcite .",
    "the spectral anisotropy of the kaw is assumed to scale as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the increased compressibility of the kaw can be seen at scales @xmath50 in figure [ fig : betas ] , where the kaw @xmath0 is seen to have a @xmath15 dependent plateau .",
    "the kaw @xmath0 in the dissipation range also depends upon the ion - to - electron temperature ratio , @xmath55 .",
    "an analytical form for the kaw @xmath0 can be derived ( see appendix [ app : ermhd ] ) within the framework of electron reduced mhd ( ermhd ) developed in @xcite , @xmath56 the kaw @xmath0 has no wavenumber dependence and thus plateaus at a value determined by @xmath15 and @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath15 and temperature ratio dependence of the kaw @xmath0 derived from vm theory is plotted in figure [ fig : kaw_beta_dep ] , where the value for the @xmath0 is averaged across the plateau at @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the behaviour of the alfvn root becomes more complicated for scales @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the alfvn root becomes the alfvn ion cyclotron mode .",
    "this mode is strongly cyclotron damped and characterized by a left - handed magnetic helicity and left - handed electric field polarization . because of the strong damping and _ in situ _ solar wind observations suggesting this mode is less common than the kaw @xcite",
    ", we do not consider it further .",
    "when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the behaviour of the alfvn root has not been thoroughly explored . the ion bernstein wave ( ibw ) @xcite",
    "is conventionally assumed to couple to the kaw at the ion gyrofrequency ; however , the kaw root that exists for @xmath51 may continue undamped at higher frequencies @xcite . since the behaviour in this region of wavenumber space is uncertain , we do not attempt to describe it here .",
    "dependence of the kaw root for @xmath62 , @xmath48 , and @xmath63 ( dotted , solid , and dashed respectively ) averaged across @xmath57 $ ] . ]",
    "the majority of _ in situ _ solar wind observations of the inertial range suggest the component responsible for most of the measured free solar wind compressibility are pressure balanced structures ( pbss ) @xcite ; however , linear pbss are degenerate with the @xmath64 , non - propagating limit of slow waves @xcite . for simplicity , we classify linear pbss as slow modes .",
    "the association of the compressible portion of the solar wind to pbss is due to the measured anti - correlation of the thermal and magnetic pressure @xcite or anti - correlation of density and magnetic field magnitude @xcite at inertial range scales .",
    "recent analyses @xcite exploring the more telling anti - correlation of density and parallel magnetic field suggest that the compressible portion of the solar wind is primarily composed of propagating slow modes rather than pbss .",
    "these analyses suggest that on average alfvn modes comprise @xmath65 of the energy and slow modes @xmath66 of the energy .",
    "the notion that the warm , @xmath67 , @xmath68 propagating slow mode exists in the solar wind defies conventional wisdom that the slow mode is strongly damped in such plasmas @xcite , so we here elucidate this point .",
    "theory @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite suggest the slow mode does not have its own active turbulent cascade ; rather , the slow mode is passively cascaded by the alfvnic turbulence .",
    "the slow mode damping rate is proportional to the parallel wavenumber , @xmath69 , and the strong damping of the slow mode suggests @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the parallel wavenumber , linear damping rate , and frequency of the slow mode .",
    "however , the passive cascade of the slow mode implies that the slow modes are cascaded by the alfvn cascade on the alfvn timescale , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , at a given @xmath75 , the parallel wavenumber of the slow mode compared to the parallel wavenumber of the alfvn mode determines the strength of the damping relative to the cascade rate : at a particular scale , @xmath75 , a slow mode with @xmath76 can be passively cascade before being damped since the slow mode damping rate will be smaller than the alfvn cascade time , @xmath77 .    for slow waves in the mhd limit , @xmath78 ( see appendix [ app : mhd ] for the derivation of this equation ) , and the vm solution does not deviate significantly from the mhd solution until finite larmor radius effects become dominant at @xmath79 .",
    "the vm solution for the slow mode @xmath0 ( blue ) is plotted in figure [ fig : betas ] assuming a passive cascade of slow waves with @xmath80a more anisotropic cascade decreases the @xmath0 below that in the figure but does not alter the qualitative behaviour .",
    "the @xmath0 for a pbs , i.e. , @xmath64 slow mode , is identically zero since @xmath81 for these modes .",
    "since the slow mode is strongly damped at large @xmath82 unless @xmath83 , we will exclude a discussion of the behaviour of this root for @xmath58 .      at inertial range scales ,",
    "the fast mode is well described by mhd , whose solution provides an @xmath0 identical to that of slow waves : @xmath78 . however , the distribution of fast waves in wavenumber space is not as well constrained as that of slow modes since the fast mode is not strongly damped for parallel propagation .",
    "further , compressible mhd turbulence simulations indicate that the fast mode is cascaded isotropically in wavenumber space @xcite .",
    "therefore , a turbulent cascade of fast modes has a @xmath0 that can take on all possible values , and the measured average value of the @xmath0 will depend sensitively on the distribution of fast modes in wavenumber space . to represent the fast mode turbulence , we plot in figure [ fig : betas ] the @xmath0 for a fast wave ( red ) with @xmath84 .",
    "we choose this value as representative because the average @xmath0 of an isotropic distribution of fast modes will be dominated by those modes with @xmath85 and the largest measured @xmath0 in a large ensemble of solar wind data is @xmath86 @xcite .    in the dissipation range at scales @xmath58 ,",
    "the fast mode transitions to a parallel whistler ( @xmath87 ) or an oblique whistler ( @xmath50 ) wave with @xmath88 .",
    "the whistler mode is well described by the electron mhd ( emhd ) equations @xcite , which describes phenomena on scales @xmath89 .",
    "note , one must take care when applying the emhd equations , because emhd is only valid for @xmath90 . for scales",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath51 , emhd describes the cold ion limit of kaws and not whistler waves @xcite . solving the emhd equations provides @xmath92 ( see appendix [ app : emhd ] ) , which is a good approximation of the vm solution and can again attain all values between @xmath48 and infinity and is sensitively dependent upon the wavenumber distribution .",
    "therefore , if the propagation angle or whistler wavenumber distribution does not change from that of the inertial range fast modes , the average @xmath0 will approximately double in the dissipation range . however , theory @xcite and simulation @xcite suggest the cascade of whistler waves is highly anisotropic in the same sense as critically balanced kaws , @xmath54 .",
    "the anisotropic nature of the dissipation range cascade suggests the average @xmath0 of a distribution of whistler waves will decrease rapidly to a @xmath15 independent value @xmath93 as the cascade progresses to smaller scales .",
    "the whistler portion of the fast modes plotted in figure [ fig : betas ] follows the critical balance prediction described above , with @xmath94 up to @xmath95 and then @xmath54 .",
    "note that the @xmath0 of whistler waves has a very weak @xmath15 and ion - to - electron temperature ratio dependence .",
    "the apparent @xmath15 dependence of the whistler branch in figure [ fig : betas ] is due to the fast - whistler break point being at @xmath96 ; therefore , the @xmath15 dependence in the figure would vanish if the x - axis were normalized to the ion inertial length .    for completeness",
    ", the fast mode to whistler transition @xmath0 is shown for several different propagation angles , @xmath97 , in figure [ fig : beta1_whistler_var ] .",
    "the @xmath0 agrees well with the predictions above , except in the @xmath98 case . for such highly oblique angles , the fast mode transitions to an ibw : at scales @xmath61 and @xmath99 , the fast mode transitions to the electrostatic ibw with frequency approximately equal to an integer multiple of the ion cyclotron frequency @xcite .",
    "the transition to the ibw is clear in the fast / whistler wave dispersion relations in figure [ fig : beta1_whistler_freq ] corresponding for the same angles as the @xmath0 presented in [ fig : beta1_whistler_var ] .",
    "although the ibw is electromagnetic during the transition from electromagnetic fast or alfvn modes , ibws are dominantly electrostatic @xcite .",
    "the properties of the transition electromagnetic ibw have not been fully explored in the literature , so we will not consider the potential contribution of ibws to the dissipation range @xmath0 .    the wavenumber distribution of whistler waves generated in a local instability such as the parallel firehose @xcite and whistler anisotropy instabilities is not easily determined and depends upon the instability ,",
    "so we will not consider them further .",
    "assuming the solar wind consists of combinations of the three wave modes described in the preceding section both in the inertial and dissipation ranges , we need to consider the effect of superposing the modes .",
    "the three linear modes can be combined into a total @xmath0 measure    @xmath100}{ac~c_{\\parallel a } + ( 1-ac ) \\left[fs~c_{\\parallel f } + ( 1-fs ) c_{\\parallel s}\\right ] } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 is the fraction of alfvn to total energy , @xmath102 is the fraction of fast to total compressible ( fast plus slow ) energy , @xmath103 , and subscripts a , f , and s refer to alfvn , fast , and slow modes . note that @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 for each mode can both be written in terms of the @xmath0 as @xmath108 and @xmath109      the assumptions that only slow modes with @xmath110 are weakly damped and approximately parallel fast modes dominate the inertial range fast mode @xmath0 lead to asymptotically small and large values of the slow and fast mode @xmath0s , respectively . due to the asymptotically",
    "large and small values of the component @xmath0s , we can estimate the value of @xmath111 in the inertial range provided @xmath112 and @xmath113 by using the @xmath0 of each mode from figure [ fig : betas ] to estimate the compressibilities , which have only a very weak @xmath15 dependence : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , in the inertial range ,    @xmath120    note that whether the slow modes are in fact propagating slow modes or pbss does not effect the estimate because @xmath121 is asymptotically small in either case .",
    "therefore , the inertial range @xmath0 depends only on the ratios of alfvn to total energy and the fast to total compressible energy ratio and is unable to differentiate between propagating slow modes and pbss .",
    "note that for observed average solar wind values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xcite , the @xmath0 can be further reduced to @xmath124 .",
    "we take as fiducial solar wind values @xmath125 and @xmath126 , or equivalently @xmath127 alfvn , @xmath128 slow , and @xmath129 fast wave energy .",
    "although we take @xmath126 , there is very little quantitative difference between @xmath126 and @xmath130 ( see figure [ mva_contour ] ) .    plotted in green in figure [ fig : betas ] is a single mixture of the three modes representing fiducial solar wind values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath0 has virtually no @xmath15 or wavenumber dependence in the inertial range , as expected from the above analysis . to explore the dependence of the @xmath0 on fluctuation composition , we plot in figure [ mva_contour ] the @xmath111 given by equation  . to confirm the quality of the estimate given by equation  , we plot in figure [ fig : inertial_sum ] the @xmath111 given by equation   ( thick ) and the estimate given by equation   ( thin ) .",
    "the figure demonstrates that equation   provides a good estimate for the total @xmath0 in the inertial range .     for different mixtures of fluctuations determined by the fractions of alfvn to total energy ( @xmath101 ) and fast to total compressible energy ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "]     ( thick ) and the inertial range estimate given by equation   ( thin ) for different combinations of the three roots .",
    "the different line types represent alfvn to total energy ( @xmath101 ) and fast to total compressible energy ( @xmath102 ) fractions : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 are solid , dotted , short dashed , long dashed , short dash - dotted , and long dash - dotted . ]",
    "also highlighted by the figure is the degeneracy of the @xmath0 , since different mixtures of modes can replicate nearly identical @xmath0s in the inertial range .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0 when used alone is not a good metric for differentiating modes in the inertial range ; however , the @xmath0 can be a useful secondary metric .",
    "for instance , when used together with density - parallel magnetic field correlations to identify the proportion of fast to slow wave energy , the @xmath0 can provide an estimate of the alfvn to compressible energy proportion , thereby quantifying the total population of the solar wind .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath0 in the transition between the inertial and dissipation ranges and in the dissipation range is markedly different from the inertial range . unlike the inertial range , where the asymptotically large and small values of the alfvn , fast , and slow waves leads to an @xmath0 that is controlled by the mode fractions @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the kaw dominates the dissipation range @xmath0 for typical solar wind parameters ( see figure [ fig : betas ] for @xmath50 , where the @xmath0 for the mixture closely follows the @xmath0 for kaws ) .",
    "the strong @xmath15 and @xmath55 dependence of the kaw @xmath0 implies that for certain values , namely @xmath53 , the whistler and kaw dissipation range @xmath0 become approximately degenerate ( see figure [ fig : betas ] for @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , the behaviour through the transition range for the alfvn to kaw and fast to whistler mode transitions differs considerably .",
    "for example , the curves in figure [ fig : inertial_sum ] with @xmath137 ( solid black ) and @xmath138 ( short dash - dotted black ) are nearly identical in the inertial and dissipation ranges , but exhibit very different behaviour across the transition range .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath0 is best presented as a function of wavenumber rather than as a quantity averaged over a band of wavenumbers , as has often been done in the literature @xcite .",
    "the conventional method for calculating the @xmath0 is as defined in  [ sec : intro ] ; however , different methods of averaging can be performed .",
    "we here consider two physically motivated alternatives for measuring the @xmath0 and compare them to the linear prediction .",
    "we also explore the validity of using linear theory to describe the @xmath0 in a fully nonlinear turbulent situation .      in the solar wind",
    ", the mean magnetic field direction is constantly changing and can sweep through a wide range of angles over a period of tens of minutes . as such , defining @xmath139 becomes questionable since @xmath140 is averaged over long , global , periods relative to the rapidly fluctuating field  this is especially problematic when measuring in the dissipation range when @xmath38 is even smaller and more rapidly fluctuating .",
    "the poor definition of parallel and perpendicular in the global analysis will pollute the parallel energy with perpendicular energy , thereby decreasing the measured solar wind @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a local analysis employing a local mean magnetic field @xcite must be employed to accurately measure @xmath38 .",
    "the local analysis has the added advantage of being able to differentiate between different @xmath141 measurements , where @xmath141 is the angle between the mean magnetic field and the solar wind flow velocity .",
    "this can be helpful because the @xmath0 will have different inertial / dissipation range breakpoints for kaws and whistlers when plotted against @xmath82 or @xmath39 .",
    "the conventional @xmath0 is constructed by calculating separately the perpendicular and parallel fluctuating magnetic energies and finding their quotient ,    @xmath142    however , a similar measure could be constructed from the normalized perpendicular and parallel energies , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , @xmath145 this measure has the physically motivated advantage of avoiding possible small denominators due to small @xmath38 .",
    "another possible measure of the @xmath0 is @xmath146 this method has the conceptual advantage of maximizing any local effect of the mean magnetic field since it averages the @xmath0 at each point rather than separately averaging the energies .",
    "however , the expression @xmath147 will be dominated by those terms with small denominators , which could make it an unphysical measure of the @xmath0    to explore the effect different averaging procedures have on the @xmath0 , we employ synthetic spacecraft data .",
    "the details for constructing the synthetic spacecraft data are discussed in @xcite , so we here only detail the relevant parameters .",
    "a three - dimensional box is populated with a spectrum of all three wave modes , where the proportion of each mode is given by @xmath125 and @xmath126 , corresponding to @xmath127 alfvn , @xmath128 slow , and @xmath129 fast wave energy .",
    "the alfvn and slow modes satisfy critical balance , with all modes less than the critical balance envelope equally populated .",

    "the averaged anisotropy , equation  , ( dotted ) approach is a poor measure of the @xmath0 because at any given point in space , the superposition of a collection of wave modes can lead to anomalously small values of @xmath38 due to cancellation .",

    "they find that the @xmath0 is proportional to a power of @xmath15 or @xmath170 but are unable to identify which is the source of the functional relationship since @xmath15 and @xmath171 are themselves positively correlated in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "they follow the identification of the @xmath0 relationship with a discussion of possible sources for the relationship based on a variety of considerations , some of which contradict the discussion in  [ sec : waves ] of this paper .",
    "@xcite do not consider the superposition of modes that has been shown to exist in the solar wind , neglect the contribution of slow modes due to the belief that they are completely damped outside of local excitation , consider alfvn waves to be completely incompressible ( @xmath172 ) , consider pbss but assert that the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath38 of pbss could contribute the the @xmath15 dependent @xmath0 despite @xmath173 for all @xmath15 .",
    "the findings of @xcite seem to be in direct contradiction to the conclusions drawn in  [ sec : mva_inertial ] ; however , there are possible reasons for the apparent discrepancy . as noted in @xcite , the proton temperature and fluctuating magnetic field",
    "are positively correlated .",
    "it has also been shown that the proton temperature and bulk solar wind speed are positively correlated @xcite .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath0 might depend on any or a combination of @xmath15 , @xmath171 , or @xmath174 .",
    "if the underlying dependence is actually on @xmath174 , then the observed variation of the @xmath0 could be from different types of solar wind launched from different regions of the sun having a variable population of alfvn to compressible components .",
    "for instance , slower wind may have evolved to a more alfvnic state , because fast modes would have had time to be dissipated in shocks and slow modes could have collisionlessly damped , leaving a primarily alfvnic and pbs population . since no measure other than @xmath0 binned by @xmath15 or @xmath170 was used in @xcite , it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion .    @xcite extend the study of the same dataset employed in @xcite to the dissipation range , defined to be @xmath175  hz  @xmath176  hz .",
    "they find that dissipation range fluctuations are less anisotropic than those in the inertial range .",
    "although not discussed in @xcite , this result is consistent with the mixtures of wave modes discussed in this paper .",
    "the linear predictions of kaw @xmath0 presented in figure [ fig : kaw_beta_dep ] for @xmath156 pass through the core of the measured @xmath0 for open magnetic field data for the measured @xmath0 in the dissipation range presented in the lower panel of figure 8 of @xcite .",
    "further , the kaw @xmath0 for @xmath177 and @xmath178 bound the core of the low @xmath15 magnetic cloud data for the measured dissipation range @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "the temperature ratio is not provided for the dataset in @xcite ; however , magnetic clouds are typically characterized by low proton temperatures @xcite , so @xmath179 for the cloud data is expected .",
    "@xcite also noted that the @xmath180 portion of the same dataset is well fit by the kaw solution ; however , the temperature ratio dependence was not explored .",
    "@xcite suggest the shallow slope at low @xmath15 might be suggestive of a whistler component .",
    "another possible explanation for some of the very low values of the dissipation range @xmath0 in @xcite is the use of a global measurement of the magnetic field , which will tend to decrease the measured @xmath0 , especially in the dissipation range .",
    "also , due to the limited high frequency information available from ace measurements @xmath181  hz @xcite , the region defined as the dissipation range corresponds to the transition region between the inertial and dissipation ranges .",
    "@xcite return again to the same ace dataset but focus on @xmath182 intervals and augment the set with 29 additional high @xmath15 ace measurements .",
    "as such , this dataset suffers from the same high frequency limitations noted above for the @xcite analysis .",
    "@xcite suggest that the measured dissipation range @xmath0 is consistent with kaws , but the inertial range @xmath0 can not be explained by a purely alfvnic population .",
    "this observation is partially used to conclude that the alfvn / kaw model can not explain solar wind measurements . however",
    ", their @xmath0 measurements agree well with a solar wind population dominated by alfvn / kaws with a small component of slow waves .",
    "therefore , we find no contradiction between the ace @xmath0 measurements and the alfvn mode dominant @xmath0 model constructed herein .",
    "using stereo measurements , @xcite employ a variant of the @xmath0 , @xmath183 , as a secondary metric to the magnetic helicity to differentiate between kaws and whistlers , which both have right - handed helicity for oblique propagation@xcite .",
    "however , they consider fast modes propagating at fixed @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , and only the @xmath184 root connects to an oblique whistler .",
    "the other two oblique roots connect to ibws , which is made clear in the upper right panel of figure 3 of @xcite , where the dispersion relation for these two roots do not extend above @xmath187 . due to this mischaracterization of the roots , they mistakenly find the oblique whistler root @xmath188 . as noted in  [ sec : fastmode ] , the whistler ( fast mode for @xmath58 ) @xmath189 for all propagation angles and @xmath15 and is thus of the same orientation as kaw and does not provide a useful secondary metric to the helicity .",
    "using cluster measurements , @xcite use magnetic compressibility , which is related to the @xmath0 in equation  , as a secondary metric to the ratio of the electric to magnetic field , @xmath190 , which is degenerate between kaws and whistlers .",
    "although the dissipation range asymptotic behaviour of the fixed propagation angle kaws and the whistlers at certain angles is similar , the transition from the inertial range to dissipation range for the two modes is different , and it is the transition region that is used to differentiate the two modes .",
    "@xcite find the cluster data to be most consistent with a spectrum of kaws .",
    "although much of the work does not directly address the @xmath0 , some recent solar wind analyses of the magnetic field have moved toward three dimensions @xcite . presenting the full three dimensional structure of the magnetic field",
    "is of obvious potential benefit ; however , there are complications due to geometrical and sampling effects of the fluctuations being advected past the spacecraft @xcite . to elucidate the complications",
    ", we follow @xcite and choose a coordinate system with @xmath8 in the @xmath191 direction and @xmath192 in the @xmath193 direction . under taylor",
    "s hypothesis , the measured components of magnetic energy in the perpendicular plane are then @xmath194 if a scaling between @xmath82 and @xmath39 is assumed , then @xmath195 @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the two - dimensional spectrum , @xmath30 is the one - dimensional scaling exponent , and @xmath198 .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath199 , implying a nonaxisymmetric energy distribution in the perpendicular plane .",
    "this complication is obviated by measuring @xmath0 in the standard way , since @xmath200 avoids the angular sampling issue altogether .      to compare the analysis method outlined in ",
    "[ sec : waves ] and [ sec : combos ] to solar wind measurements , we choose a 5 day interval , 2008 feb 12 06:00 to feb 17 06:00 , of magnetic field data captured by the stereo a spacecraft .",
    "this interval is one of 20 similar intervals analysed by @xcite , where details concerning the data selection and analysis can be found .",
    "so , we here summarize only the most pertinent aspects of the measurement and analysis .",
    "the interval was chosen because it represents an interval of high - speed wind , which typically satisfies the assumption that the solar wind flow direction is in the heliocentric radial direction , @xmath201 . also , the interval is sufficiently long to include a statistically large sample of periods during which the mean magnetic field , @xmath140 , is nearly perpendicular to the radial direction , which in practice includes the range @xmath202 .",
    "focusing on these orthogonal periods is helpful because it facilitates easier comparison to theory since the measured wavenumber in the solar wind corresponds more closely to the perpendicular wavenumber used in linear theory .",
    "the magnetic field data was analysed using wavelet techniques to determine the local mean magnetic field , @xmath203 , at a given scale @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular magnetic energies are then given by @xmath205 and @xmath206 , where @xmath207 .",
    "the proton plasma parameters for the interval were supplied by the plastic instrument @xcite .",
    "the relevant proton plasma parameters are @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , where all quantities are averaged over the entire interval except @xmath212 whose median is taken because of its high variability .",
    "electron thermal data is unavailable due to problems with the impact solar wind electron analyzer aboard stereo @xcite , so we assume the electron temperature to be the average for fast wind streams found by @xcite , @xmath213 .",
    "this assumption for the electrons implies @xmath214 for the data interval .    to convert spacecraft - frame frequency , @xmath215 , to wavenumber , we employ taylor s hypothesis , which states that @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the plasma rest - frame frequency . for oblique alfvnic and kaw fluctuations , @xmath218 @xcite , and we can assume @xmath219 . to compare to linear theory , we convert spacecraft frame frequency to wavenumber using @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is computed from the average solar wind proton quantities for the measured interval .    in figure [",
    "fig : stereo ] , we compare the measured @xmath0 for this interval ( blue ) to the @xmath0 from linear theory with @xmath222 and @xmath223 for two different mixtures of wave modes that reproduce the solar wind @xmath0 in the inertial range : a mixture that is dominantly alfvnic ( black ) with @xmath224 and a mixture that is dominantly fast mode ( red dashed ) with @xmath225 . although both mixtures of linear wave modes reproduce well the behaviour in the inertial range , the fast mode dominant construction displays markedly different transition and dissipation range behaviour ; whereas , the alfvn dominant mixture fits well the _ slope _ of the transition range and the asymptotic value in the dissipation range . from this , we can conclude that the measured interval is most likely dominated by alfvn wave fluctuations at @xmath59 and kaw fluctuations for @xmath61 .",
    "we speculate that the positive slope in the measured inertial range @xmath0 may be attributable to a decreasing fraction of slow wave energy due to collisionless damping as the turbulent cascade proceeds to kinetic scales . also , the approximate factor of two difference between the predicted @xmath0 from linear theory and the solar wind values in the transition and dissipation ranges are likely due to averaging @xmath15 and @xmath221 over the entire 5 day interval .",
    "the @xmath0 of kaws has a moderately strong @xmath15 dependence ( see figures [ fig : betas ] and [ fig : kaw_beta_dep ] ) . for the purposes of comparison",
    ", we use a median @xmath222 .",
    "however , the @xmath0 of kaws increases with decreasing @xmath15 , so periods of low @xmath15 will tend to dominate the average @xmath0 and shift it upward from the prediction based on a median value of @xmath222 .",
    "similarly , we use a value for @xmath221 based on quantities averaged over 5 days of data to determine the relationship between frequency and wavenumber . the variance associated with the averaged @xmath221",
    "could cause an apparent horizontal shift of the data in the transition and dissipation ranges .    for comparison ,",
    "we also plot in figure [ fig : stereo ] the measured @xmath0 for the stereo a data computed via a more conventional global analysis ( green ) .",
    "the @xmath226  day interval of data was segmented into @xmath227 @xmath48  hr intervals . in each @xmath48",
    "hr segment , the mean magnetic field was calculated , the data rotated into mean field coordinates , and a welch windowed fft was applied to compute the parallel and perpendicular magnetic energies .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular magnetic energies were then averaged over the @xmath227 @xmath48  hr segments and binned into logarithmic wavenumber bins to smooth the spectra .",
    "the global @xmath0 ( green ) was then calculated from the binned and averaged magnetic field data . as expected , this method is inappropriate to compare to linear theory and produces a significantly reduced @xmath0 compared to the wavelet analysis because the parallel magnetic energy is polluted with perpendicular energy , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : sw_model ] .",
    "this analysis of solar wind data highlights the importance of performing a local analysis and the weaknesses and strengths of the @xmath0 for determining the solar wind fluctuation composition : the @xmath0 is a poor tool to use in the inertial range due to degeneracies of different wave mode mixtures .",
    "however , if the inertial range @xmath0 is augmented with a second measure that identifies the the fast to total compressible energy fraction ( @xmath102 ) , such as the density - parallel magnetic field correlation , the @xmath0 can provide a measure of the alfvn to total energy fraction ( @xmath101 ) .",

    "we have developed a framework for interpreting the measured solar wind magnetic variance anisotropy ( @xmath0 ) and comparing the measurements to linear theory . in  [ sec : waves ] we reviewed the linear properties of the collisionless counterparts to the three mhd wave modes , which are expected to be the primary constituents of the solar wind in those relevant regions of wavenumber space spanning the inertial and dissipation ranges where collisionless damping rate is small compared to the rate nonlinear energy transfer .",
    "the @xmath0 of each wave mode for a range of plasma betas , @xmath15 , is shown in figure [ fig : betas ] versus perpendicular wavenumber .    in  [ sec : combos ] we examined how superpositions of the three wave modes affects the @xmath0 . due to the asymptotically large @xmath0 of the alfvn and",
    "fast modes and asymptotically small @xmath0 of the slow mode in the inertial range , the inertial range @xmath0 is dictated by the fraction of each mode rather than the individual behaviour of each mode and has little @xmath15 dependence .",
    "note that linear pressure balanced structures ( pbss ) are equivalent to @xmath64 , non - propagating slow modes , and are thus classified as slow modes .",
    "an estimate of the inertial range @xmath0 is given by equation  , where the @xmath0 is determined by the fraction of alfvn to total ( alfvn plus fast plus slow ) energy and the fraction of fast to total compressible ( fast plus slow ) energy . for @xmath53 , the dissipation range value of the @xmath0 for kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) and whistler waves is approximately degenerate ; however , the behaviour of the @xmath0 through the transition to the dissipation range differs in form for kaws and whistlers .",
    "the degeneracy in the dissipation range highlights the value of displaying the @xmath0 as a function of wavenumber .    in  [ sec : sim ] we employ a suite of fully nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence simulations that span from the inertial range to deep into the dissipation range for @xmath155 and @xmath48 to demonstrate that the predictions of the @xmath0 from linear theory are applicable to nonlinear turbulence .",

    "since the @xmath0 of previous solar wind studies typically bins the @xmath0 over a band of wavenumbers and computes the @xmath0 via a global analysis , the data is difficult to interpret and compare to linear theory ; however , the @xmath0 observed in previous studies is mostly consistent with solar wind composed primarily of alfvnic fluctuations and conforms well to the theory outlined in this paper .
