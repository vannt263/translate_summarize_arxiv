    "the effective field theory of qcd , called chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , has become a very successful methodology for low - energy hadron physics .",
    "this effective field theory is based upon the goldstone character of the low - lying pseudoscalar mesons and incorporates the appropriate symmetries of the strong interaction . in this approach ,",
    "one obtains a systematic expansion in powers of external momentum and light quark masses , or equivalently in the number of loops .",
    "however , in order to be renormalized order by order , additional low - energy constants have to be introduced at each order in the chiral expansion .",
    "these low - energy constants are not fixed by chiral symmetry alone but have to be determined phenomenologically .",
    "at one - loop order in the chiral expansion only a small number of low - energy constants have to be introduced @xcite .",
    "these are known rather accurately @xcite and have been used in order to relate different observables to each other .",
    "therefore , one - loop chpt provides finite predictions for many different low - energy observables in terms of only a very limited amount of empirical input .",
    "even though this has been remarkably successful , the two - loop corrections are important in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions . however , two - loop computations are very laborious and have until now only been accomplished in a limited number of cases .",
    "furthermore , the total number of low - energy constants increases dramatically at this order in the chiral expansion @xcite . since an extensive phenomenological analysis of these new two - loop low - energy constants is not available at present , they have so far been evaluated either from the given process or from underlying models .",
    "since chpt provides a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of external momentum and light quark masses , it will satisfy unitarity perturbatively .",
    "this implies that the deviation from exact unitarity at a given order provides an estimate of the energy range where the truncation of the chiral expansion is applicable , i.e. the energy range where higher order corrections can be neglected .",
    "although these higher order corrections could in principle be calculated and thereby increase the energy range of the chiral expansion , chpt is in practice limited to the first few powers in the loop expansion .",
    "this is due to the rapid increase in both computational effort and new low - energy constants at each additional order .",
    "thus , the unitarity restriction will give a major limitation on the applicability of chpt .",
    "an important special case of this fact is in the presence of resonances where higher order unitarity corrections become essential .",
    "therefore , in order to extend the range of applicability of chpt , unitarity will be of the utmost importance . a rather general way to impose unitarity on the chiral expansion",
    "is by the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite , which can be justified by the use of unitarity in a dispersive approach .",
    "since this method combines unitarity and dispersion relations with the chiral expansion , it is likely that it will be more powerful than chpt alone .",
    "the iam applied to one - loop order in the chiral expansion has been extensively analysed @xcite and has indeed proven to be a successful method to extend the range of applicability of one - loop chpt .",
    "however , the iam is not restricted to the one - loop approximation but can in general be applied to any given order in the chiral expansion .",
    "therefore , it might well be that the iam applied to a given order can be improved by applying it to the next order .",
    "if this turns out to be the case , the iam could be considered as a systematic way of improving chpt order by order in the chiral expansion .",
    "the iam was originally applied to @xmath0 scattering and the pion form factors to one loop in chpt @xcite . by now",
    ", the full two - loop @xmath0 scattering amplitude has been evaluated by a dispersive analysis @xcite and a field theory calculation @xcite , respectively .",
    "the pion form factors have also been evaluated to two loops some time ago @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is now possible to apply the iam to two loops in the chiral expansion for both @xmath0 scattering and the pion form factors . in the present paper ,",
    "this extension of the iam is analysed and compared to both the one - loop case and one- and two - loop chpt in order to study whether the iam is a systematic way of improving chpt .",

    "recently , the two - loop correction @xmath22 has also been evaluated by a dispersive analysis @xcite and a field theory calculation @xcite , respectively .",
    "these two approaches agree insofar as the general structure of the amplitude is concerned",
    ". however , the field theory calculation contains additional information regarding the dependence of the chiral low - energy constants which is not obtained in the dispersive analysis .",
    "the full @xmath0 scattering amplitude to two loops in chpt is given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the contributions of @xmath23 have been omitted here . at one - loop order , there are four low - energy constants @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , whereas six additional low - energy constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 have to be introduced at two - loop order .",
    "the superscript @xmath34 indicates that these low - energy constants depend on the renormalization scale @xmath35 , whereas the full amplitude is scale independent .",
    "the projection onto partial waves of the chiral @xmath0 scattering amplitude ( [ eq : chptexam ] ) gives the following expansion @xmath36 these partial waves will satisfy the elastic unitarity relation ( [ eq : pfuni ] ) perturbatively , i.e. one has to two - loop order @xmath37 the first inelastic channel is the four pion intermediate state , which is a three - loop effect of @xmath23 . other inelastic channels with more pions are of even higher order in the chiral expansion .",
    "this implies that the perturbative elastic unitarity relations to two loops will hold at least up to the @xmath14 threshold .",
    "in fact , in the framework of su(2 ) chpt the relations ( [ eq : ppuni ] ) are satisfied for all energies above threshold , whereas in su(3 ) chpt they have to be generalized above the @xmath14 and @xmath38 thresholds .",
    "the generalization above the @xmath14 threshold is obtained from the perturbative interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epfuni ] ) @xmath39 the further extension of these perturbative relations above the @xmath38 threshold is obtained in a straightforward manner .",
    "the two - loop @xmath0 scattering amplitude has hitherto only been evaluated within the framework of su(2 ) chpt @xcite .",
    "this implies that in the derivation of the iam applied to two loops in the chiral expansion , the elastic approximation is used .",
    "however , the limitations of this approximation and the possible extension to su(3 ) chpt will also be discussed in some detail .      from the fundamental principles of s matrix theory",
    ", it can be shown that the @xmath0 partial waves are analytic in the complex @xmath40 plane with a right or unitarity cut for @xmath41 and a left cut for @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 partial waves can be expressed in terms of dispersion relations with a number of subtractions to ensure the convergence of the integrals .",
    "the same is also true for the inverse of the partial waves or more exactly for the function @xmath43 . neglecting possible pole contributions arising from zeros in the partial waves @xcite",
    ", the four times subtracted dispersion relation for the iam is @xmath44 four subtractions are used in order to ensure that two - loop chpt satisfies a similar dispersion relation . on the right cut , the elastic unitarity relation ( [ eq : pfuni ] )",

    ", one finds that the left cut can be approximated by @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the subtraction constants can also be evaluated to two - loop order in the chiral expansion . denoting these subtraction constants",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , the following dispersion relation is obtained for the iam @xmath53 ds'}{s'^4(s'-s - i\\epsilon ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this dispersion relation implies that the partial wave @xmath54 can be obtained from the two - loop chiral expansion .",
    "however , the relation between the iam and two - loop chpt can be simplified by writing down a four - subtracted dispersion relation for the function @xmath55 .",
    "since this is the function @xmath46 expanded to two - loop order , the left cut and subtraction constants in the dispersion relation for @xmath56 will be the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispinv1 ] ) . for the right cut ,",

    "( [ eq : dispinv1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the iam to two loops in the chiral expansion gives the partial wave @xmath54 in the simple form @xmath59 since this is formally equivalent to the [ 0,2 ] pad approximant applied on chpt , the expression ( [ eq : pade2 ] ) will coincide with the chiral expansion up to two - loop order .",
    "however , in deriving ( [ eq : pade2 ] ) two - loop chpt has only been used for the left cut and the subtraction constants , whereas the important unitarity cut was computed exactly .",
    "this is in contrast to chpt where the unitarity cut was only computed perturbatively . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the [ 0,2 ] pad approximant ( [ eq : pade2 ] ) satisfies the elastic unitarity relation ( [ eq : pfuni ] ) exactly and not only perturbatively as in chpt .",
    "the iam can in general be applied to any given order in the chiral expansion , but has up to now almost entirely been restricted to the one - loop approximation @xcite . in this case , the iam gives the partial waves in the form @xmath60 which is formally equivalent to the [ 0,1 ] pad approximant .",
    "this form also satisfies unitarity exactly and coincides with the chiral expansion up to one - loop order .",
    "it is derived in the same way as described above , the only difference being that the left cut and subtraction constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispinv1 ] ) are now approximated only to one - loop order in the chiral expansion .",
    "this shows how the iam to two loops improves the iam to one loop , even though the dominantly unitarity cut is computed exactly in both cases .",
    "the above discussion rests upon the assumption that the leading order term @xmath61 does not vanish .",
    "in fact , this is only true for the lowest partial waves with @xmath62 , whereas the higher partial waves start at one - loop order in the chiral expansion . in these cases ,",
    "the iam must be slightly modified by writing down a dispersion relation for the function @xmath63 . since perturbative",
    "unitarity implies that @xmath64 is real on the right cut for these higher partial waves , the elastic unitarity relation ( [ eq : pfuni ] ) gives @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the right cut can also in these cases be computed exactly , whereas the left cut and subtraction constants can be approximated by means of chpt as above .",
    "however , in order to relate the dispersion relation for the iam to a corresponding one for chpt , one has to go to three loops in the chiral expansion .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the higher partial waves the imaginary part on the right cut starts at @xmath23 in chpt .",
    "should such a three - loop calculation be undertaken in the future , the iam could also in these cases be directly related to chpt in the same way as discussed above .",
    "it would be desirable if the iam could be applied beyond the elastic approximation .",
    "the first important inelastic channel in @xmath0 scattering opens up at the @xmath14 threshold and is due to the @xmath14 intermediate state . at a slightly higher energy",
    "the @xmath38 inelastic channel will also appear , but this is a rather unimportant effect . only at still higher energies will the four - pion intermediate state begin to be significant , together with other inelastic channels .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath38 intermediate states are already present at one - loop order in su(3 ) chpt @xcite , and will therefore also appear in an extension of the present two - loop calculation to the su(3 ) case .",
    "thus , it might be that the iam applied to two loops in the su(3 ) chiral expansion could include these inelasticities . in order to try to include the four - pion intermediate state , one would need to apply the iam to three loops since this effect is of @xmath23 in the chiral expansion .",
    "therefore , the following discussion is restricted to the @xmath14 and @xmath38 inelastic channels .",
    "in fact , it will be limited to the important @xmath14 case since the extension to the @xmath66 case is rather obvious .",
    "to include the @xmath14 inelastic channel , the extended unitarity relation ( [ eq : epfuni ] ) has to be used above the @xmath14 threshold in computing the right cut in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispinv1 ] ) , whereas the other parts are computed in exactly the same way as before . thus , since the relation ( [ eq : epfuni ] ) gives @xmath67 , this expression has to be used above the @xmath14 threshold in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispinv1 ] ) .",
    "however , in this case it is not possible to compute the inelastic part @xmath68 exactly , so this part must be evaluated to two loops in the su(3 ) chiral expansion @xmath69 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to simplify the relation between the iam and chpt for the su(3 ) case , the right cut in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispchi ] ) has to be evaluated with the inclusion of the @xmath14 intermediate state . from the extended perturbative unitarity relations ( [ eq : eppuni ] )",
    ", one finds that @xmath70 is given by an expression exactly similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : inelaex ] ) .",
    "thus , the inelastic case also gives a result of the form ( [ eq : pade2 ] ) , the only difference being that in this case the chiral su(3 ) expansion is used . in a similar way , by expanding the inelastic part @xmath68 to one - loop order , the iam gives a result of the form ( [ eq : pade1 ] ) with chpt evaluated within su(3 ) .",
    "in the presence of the @xmath14 inelasticity , the unitarity cut can not be computed exactly , but one has to expand the inelastic part to a given chiral order . since the inelastic part starts at the @xmath14 threshold , the one- and two - loop chiral expansions would seem to lead to rather unreliable approximations .",
    "however , it is important to realize that for the inelastic iam the exact extended unitarity relation has been applied before the inelastic part is approximated by the chiral expansion . furthermore , if one compare the expansion of the inelastic part for the iam ( [ eq : inelaex ] ) with the corresponding expansion for chpt ( [ eq : eppuni ] ) , the two - loop correction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inelaex ] ) is likely to be more suppressed compared to the two - loop correction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eppuni ] ) .",
    "therefore , one might expect that the expansion of the inelastic quantity @xmath68 converges rather rapidly , i.e. the one- and two - loop expansion could be used over a large energy range .",
    "indeed , as will be shown in the case of the pion form factors , the expansion of a similar quantity works very well up to rather high energies .    in order to evaluate",
    "how well the inelastic iam agrees with the extended unitarity relation ( [ eq : epfuni ] ) , one needs to determine the @xmath71 partial waves . to do this ,",
    "the iam could be applied to one- and two - loop order for these partial waves . in this way",
    "one finds that the inelastic iam satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : epfuni ] ) exactly , provided that the quantity @xmath68 is determined by the leading order term .",
    "thus , the iam is a rather consistent approach , but there is of course no way to know a priori to what extent this method can reproduce the inelasticities .",
    "the chiral expansion depends on a number of low - energy constants not fixed by chiral symmetry alone .",
    "these have to be determined before chpt and the iam can be compared with experimental data . in the present paper , this comparison is limited to the lowest @xmath0 partial waves with @xmath62 , since they are the best known experimentally .",
    "since the chiral low - energy constants depend on the renormalization scale @xmath35 , this scale has to be chosen before the low - energy constants can be fixed .",
    "this scale will be set at the mass of the @xmath72(770 ) resonance , i.e. @xmath73 mev .",
    "in addition , throughout this paper the values @xmath74 mev and @xmath75 mev are used for the pion decay constant and pion mass , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 partial waves depend on four low - energy constants @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 to one - loop order in the chiral expansion .",
    "these have been determined phenomenologically rather accurately in one - loop chpt @xcite with results displayed in the first column in table [ table1 ] . for chpt to two loops , these low - energy constants should in principle be re - evaluated taking into account the two - loop corrections . however , since a thorough reevaluation seems rather out of reach at the moment , the one - loop values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are also used in two - loop chpt .",
    "the additional low - energy constants to two loops @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 may be estimated with the assumption that they are dominated by resonance contributions at the scale of the resonance , an assumption that is well satisfied in one - loop chpt @xcite .",
    "in particular , including contributions from vector and scalar exchange together with terms of @xmath76 coming from su(3 ) one - loop chpt @xcite , one obtains the values for these two - loop low - energy constants given in the second column in table [ table1 ] @xcite .",
    "the iam to a given order depends on the same low - energy constants as chpt to the same order . however , the phenomenological determination of these low - energy constants by the iam do not necessarily coincide precisely with the values obtained in chpt .",
    "this is due to the fact that the iam contains higher order unitarity corrections , which will effect the phenomenological determination of the low - energy constants . some of the low - energy constants in the iam to one and two loops may be determined phenomenologically by fitting the experimental @xmath0 phase shifts . in this",
    "fitting , the data obtained from @xmath77 decays @xcite are used together with the data from high statistics medium energy experiments @xcite . for a recent discussion of the experimental @xmath0 scattering data",
    "@xcite .",
    "the low - energy constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the iam to one loop may be determined in this way , whereas the fit will be rather insensitive to the precise values of the other low - energy constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for these latter low - energy constants ,",
    "the values obtained in one - loop chpt are also used in the iam to one loop . in the case of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "one is used to fix the @xmath72(770 ) resonance defined to be at @xmath78 , whereas the other is determined by fitting the @xmath79 and @xmath80 experimental phase shifts for @xmath81 gev .",
    "this will give an acceptable fit with values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 given in the third column in table [ table1 ] , whereas if one increase the energy range to @xmath82 gev , the fit will not be acceptable .    however , the iam to two loops might improve the agreement with the experimental phase shifts up to @xmath83 gev . in this case",
    "the fit is mainly sensitive to @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , so the other low - energy constants will be given by the same values as in two - loop chpt . with the use of the @xmath72(770 )",
    "resonance to fix @xmath33 and varying @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath32 around the values used in two - loop chpt , these low - energy constants are determined by fitting the @xmath79 and @xmath80 experimental phase shifts up to @xmath83 gev . in this case",
    "one obtains an acceptable fit with values of the low - energy constants given in the fourth column in table [ table1 ] .",
    "there is no point in extending this fit further up in energy since inelastic effects will become essential above approximately 0.9 gev .",
    "the low - energy constants in table [ table1 ] have not been assigned any error bars since it is difficult to estimate these error bars taking into account the higher order corrections . in addition , it is not possible to assign reliable error bars on the two - loop low - energy constants estimated from resonance exchange .",
    "nevertheless , from table [ table1 ] it is observed that the values of the low - energy constants in chpt and the iam to both one and two loops are rather consistent with each other .",
    "however , some variations are indeed to be expected due to the different treatments of the higher order corrections .      close to threshold",
    ", the @xmath0 partial waves can be parametrized in terms of scattering lengths @xmath84 and slope parameters @xmath85 @xcite . in table",
    "[ table2 ] , the values obtained from chpt and the iam are compared to the experimental information for these threshold parameters . it is observed that one - loop chpt gives relatively large corrections to the leading order current algebra results , whereas the additional two - loop chpt corrections are somewhat smaller .",
    "however , the difference between one and two - loop chpt is in general larger than the corresponding difference between the iam to one and two loops , which supports the expectation that the iam to one loop already includes the most important unitarity corrections .",
    "in fact , the iam to both one and two loops compares remarkably well with two - loop chpt for the @xmath86 s wave , where the unitarity corrections are important even at low energies .",
    "for the other channels , where the higher order unitarity corrections are less important at low energies , the iam compares in general rather well with both one and two - loop chpt .    regarding the comparison with the experimental information , both the iam and chpt to one and two loops are quite consistent with the data .",
    "unfortunately , the precision of these data does not allow one to distinguish the higher order corrections from the one - loop contribution , but this might be improved with the forthcoming accurately determination of @xmath87 from the measurement of the lifetime of the @xmath88 atom @xcite .",
    "even though the chiral expansion only satisfies unitarity perturbatively , chpt is not in general restricted to the threshold region .",
    "however , the deviation from exact unitarity will give an estimate of the actual energy range where the given truncation of the chiral expansion is applicable .",
    "this deviation is shown in the argand diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the three lowest partial waves .",
    "this shows that unitarity is indeed improved at low energies at each additional order in the chiral expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "two - loop chpt begins to deviate significantly from exact unitarity above approximately 0.5 gev for all three partial waves .",
    "therefore , two - loop chpt should only be trusted up to about this energy , whereas the energy range for one - loop chpt is somewhat smaller .",
    "despite the fact that chpt only satisfies unitarity perturbatively , it is possible to define a chiral expansion for the phase shifts @xmath12 @xcite . in fig .",

    "furthermore , consistent with recent phenomenological analysis @xcite , this method also gives a pole in the @xmath86 s wave responsible for the strong final - state interaction in this channel .",
    "in fact , these poles have only been obtained for the iam to one loop @xcite but the same should also be true in general . since this analytical structure is not trivial at all , this strongly supports the applicability of the iam .",

    "<S> the two - loop approach compares well with the one - loop approximation , and in the threshold region they both agree with chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the inverse amplitude method is indeed a rather systematic way of improving chiral perturbation theory order by order in the chiral expansion . </S>"
