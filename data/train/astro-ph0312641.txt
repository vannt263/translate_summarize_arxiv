    "interstellar dust is completely characterized by the composition , morphology , and size distribution of its various particles , and by the abundance , relative to hydrogen , of its elemental constituents .",
    "a viable dust model should be able to explain the various astrophysical phenomena associated with the presence of dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) : the wavelength dependence of the interstellar extinction , albedo , and polarization , the infrared emission , and the observed elemental depletion pattern as primary constraints , and the extended red emission ( ere ) as a secondary constraint .",
    "dust characteristics may vary in the different ism phases and galactic locations . here",
    "we concentrate on characterizing the dust in the local diffuse ism .",
    "interstellar dust models have evolved with the advance of observational data . until recently ,",
    "the most popular dust model was the mathis , rumple , & nordsieck ( 1977 ; hereafter mrn ) , which , using the dust optical constants of @xcite provided an excellent fit to the average interstellar extinction curve .",
    "the model consisted of a population of spherical graphite and silicate dust particles with a @xmath0 power ",
    "law distribution in grain radii in the \\{@xmath1 = \\{0.005 @xmath2 m , 0.25 @xmath2 m } size interval .",
    "assuming solar composition for the ism , the model required essentially all the interstellar carbon , c / h = 370  ppm ( parts per million ) , and all the magnesium , silicon , and iron , mg / h , si / h , fe / h = \\{34 , 35 , 28 } , to be locked up in dust .    the first observational evidence for the incompleteness of the mrn dust model was provided by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) all sky survey , which provided the average infrared ( ir ) emission spectrum at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100  @xmath2 m from the diffuse ism .",
    "the observations showed an excess of 12 and 25  @xmath2 m emission over that expected from dust heated by the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and radiating at the equilibrium dust temperature .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mrn grain size distribution should be extended to very small grains ( vsg ) with radii of @xmath3 5  which undergo temperature fluctuations when heated by the isrf .",
    "allamandola , tielens , & barker ( 1985 ) , and @xcite identified these vsg with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules whose presence in the ism was inferred from the ubiquitous solid state emission features at 3.3 , 6.7 , 7.6 , 8.6 , and 11.3  @xmath2 m .",
    "we point out that the identification of pahs with these ir features is not universally accepted [ see @xcite for a review ] .",
    "the _ iras _ observations pointed out the importance of the ir emission as a constraint on interstellar dust models . the first model that attempted to fit in a self - consistent manner the interstellar extinction as well as the diffuse ir emission using pahs as an interstellar dust component was the model of dsert , boulanger , & puget ( 1990 )",
    ". however , their model did not use physical optical constants for the various dust components , and was primarily empirical in nature .",
    "interstellar polarization provides addtional constraints on interstellar dust particles @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter authors presented a interstellar dust model consisting of pahs , and cylindrical silicates coated with an organic refractory mantle .",
    "their model satisfies the interstellar extinction , polarization and solar abundances constraints .",
    "it did not attempt to fit the diffuse ir emission , and used particles with hypothetical optical constants to represent the far - uv extinction and the 2200   extinction hump .",
    "the diffuse ir background experiment ( dirbe ) and far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) instrument on board the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ )",
    "satellite provided the most extensive wavelength coverage ( 3.5 to 1000  @xmath2 m ) of the ir emission from the diffuse ism , and indirect evidence for the emission from pahs from this phase of the medium @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to fit the interstellar extinction and diffuse ir emission using a mix of bare silicate and graphite particles with @xcite optical constants , and pahs with the optical properties of @xcite .",
    "the model failed to reproduce the observed interstellar extinction , primarily due to the non - physical nature of the uv - optical properties adopted for the pahs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite improved on this model by using a more realistic characterization of the optical properties of the pahs , based on laboratory measurements .",
    "however , their model requires an excessive amount of mg , si , and fe to be locked up in dust , almost twice the available iron for an ism with solar abundances .    in this paper",
    "we explore possible dust models that simultaneously comply with the three major observational constraints : the average interstellar extinction , the thermal ir emission form the diffuse ism , and the interstellar abundances constraints .",
    "the model explores a variety of potential dust compositions , including bare silicate ( mgfesio@xmath4 ) , graphite , amorphous carbon particles , pahs , and composite particles consisting of a mixture of silicate , refractory organic material ( c : h : o : n @xmath5 1:1:0.2:0.04 ; we will adopt c@xmath6h@xmath6o@xmath7n for simplicity ) , water ice ( h@xmath8o ) , and voids .",
    "the model is physical in the sense that it uses measured optical constants or observed radiative properties to characterize the optical properties of the various dust constituents . given the composition and physical properties of the dust particles , the problem of simultaneously fitting the model to a set of observational constraints is a typical ill - posed inversion problem , in which the grain size distribution is the unknown .",
    "we solve this problem using the method of regularization .",
    "in  [ section : theoretical_model ] we present the integral equation that we invert in order to solve for the grain size distribution .",
    "the general equations for the interstellar extinction , ir emission , and elemental dust abundances are cast as a fredholm integral equation of the first kind .",
    "the left hand side ( lhs ) in the equation comprises of the observational input data , and the rhs is an integral over grain sizes of a known function , the kernel , multiplied by an unknown fuction , the grain size distribution .",
    "the section summarizes the observational input data used in our analysis : the average interstellar extinction , thermal ir emission per h  atom , the average interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) to which the dust is exposed , and the allowable amount of refractory elements that can be locked up in the dust , and the physical properties of the dust that are used in the kernel . ",
    "[ section : regularization ] describes the regularization method that we used to invert the fredholm equation to derive the distribution of grain sizes that satisfies the observational constraints for a given kernel .",
    "modeling details are presented in ",
    "[ section : mod_details ] .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in  [ section : results ] .",
    "we show that the li & draine pah , bare silicate , and graphite model can be optimized , and we produce an equally good fit to the observational constraints without violating the interstellar abundance constraints for a different , more general , grain size distribution .",
    "we also show that the pah , bare silicate and graphite grain model is not unique .",
    "a more complex dust model comprising of pahs , bare silicate and graphite grains , as well as organic refractory and icy silicates , provides a somewhat improved fit to the observational constraints , including the interstellar abundances .",
    "a summary of the paper , its astrophysical implications , and directions for future improvements and tests for interstellar dust models are presented in   [ section : implications ] and [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the goal of our studies is to find dust models that simultaneously fit the observed interstellar extinction , infrared emission , and elemental abundance constraints .",

    "this produces a factor of 1.12 difference between their adopted extinction curve and ours .",
    "the uncertainties on figure  [ fig : extinction1 ] are the observed dispersion of the curve .",
    "the estimate in the uv - through - optical segment is based on the _ ans _ satellite work by @xcite covering about 1000 sightlines .",
    "the uncertainty in the infrared part was estimated supposing the @xmath63 dispersion of 0.4 to 0.5 , which is consistent with the observed scatter of the extinction curve at 1500   @xcite .",
    "the _ cobe _ all sky survey provided the most comprehensive spectrum of dust emission from the diffuse ism in eight dirbe bands at 3.5 , 4.9 , 12 , 25 , 60 , 100 , 140 , and 240  @xmath2 m , and in the firas channels spanning the @xmath3 200 and 1000  @xmath2 m wavelength range @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : emission1 ] shows the average ir emission from the diffuse ism used by us to constrain the dust models .",
    "the uncertainties of the dirbe fluxes are from @xcite .    since the chemical composition of the dust can not be directly measured , it is common to estimate the abundance of an element locked up in dust by subtracting the observed gas phase abundance of that element from an adopted measure of its total ism abundance .",
    "the latter is determined from stellar surface abundances which are believed to represent the total abundance of that element in the gas and dust phases of the ism from which those stars have formed . due to the uncertainties in the choice of a representative set of average ism abundances we have used three different measurements based on solar @xcite , b  star @xcite , and f and g  star @xcite abundances to characterize the standard abundances of the elements in the ism .",
    "figure  [ fig : abund_ld01 ] and table  [ tab_dust_abund ] summarizes the abundances of the most abundant elements expected to be in the dust : c , o , si , mg , fe , and n. also shown in the table are the measured gas phase abundances of these elements .",
    "the dust phase abundances used to constrain the dust models are simply the ism minus the gas phase abundances for the different elements .",
    "because of the large discrepancy between the two available estimates of the gas - phase c of 140@xmath7120 @xcite and 75@xmath7125 @xcite , we adopted a single estimate of 108@xmath7116 that is a straight average of the two values .",
    "several dust compositions were used to characterize the interstellar dust population : ( 1 ) _ bare silicate and graphite grains _ with optical constants of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; ( 2 ) _ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) _ with specific density of 2.24  g @xmath72 , and absorption cross sections from @xcite ; and ( 3 ) _ amorphous carbon dust_. we tried three different types of amorphous carbon : acar , be , and ach2 atmosphere at 10  mbar ; be sample was produced by burning of benzene in air under normal consitions @xcite ] with the optical constants from @xcite .",
    "in addition to these dust constituents , we also considered composite particles composed of silicate , amorphous carbon , and variations of the following components : ( 1 ) _ organic refractory material _ consisting of [ c@xmath6h@xmath6o@xmath7n ] with optical constants from @xcite ; ( 2 ) _ water ice _ , with optical constants from @xcite ; and ( 3 ) _",
    "voids_. table [ tab_dust_const ] summarizes the properties of the different dust constituents used in this paper .",
    "like @xcite , we treat pahs and graphite as different dust components . however , we allow for the extension of the graphite grain size distribution to very small particles . very small graphite particles are essentially dehydrated pahs .",
    "in contrast , li & draine extend the graphite size distribution only down to 50   , and adopt pah - like properties for carbonaceous particles with sizes below @xmath320   .",
    "as we will show in  5.1 , as a result of this difference we derive a carbonaceous grain size distribution that is considerably simpler than that of @xcite .",
    "to build @xmath48 , we need to know the extinction and absorption cross sections : @xmath20}_{\\rm{ext}}(\\lambda , a)$ ] , @xmath20}_{\\rm{abs}}(\\lambda , a)$ ] , emissivities @xmath24}_{\\lambda}(\\lambda , a)$ ] , densities @xmath13 , and mass fractions @xmath73 .",
    "the densities used are listed in table [ tab_dust_const ] , the mass fractions are easily calculated by using atomic and molecular masses of dust constituents .    for the bare silicate , graphite , and amorphous carbon particles ,",
    "the extinction and absorption cross sections were calculated using mie theory for spherical dust particles @xcite . for the composite material , at first step , we used an effective medium theory ( emt ) to calculate its dielectric function , and , at second step , we used mie theory to calculate the absorption and scattering cross sections with the effective dielectric function .",
    "the effective dielectric function was calculated by making use of an emt based on the bruggeman approach with adjusted effective shape factors ( emt - o ) , that gives the following equation for the effective dielectric function @xmath74 @xcite : @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the volume fraction and isotropic dielectric function of component @xmath35 , and @xmath83 are some shape factors for ellipsoidal grains .",
    "equation ( [ eq : epsilon_eff ] ) is an approximation to different experiments and theories .",
    "the emt - o approach takes into consideration the effects of shape distribution , proximity , connected particles and percolation , and thus it is highly suitable for treating the composite particles which are the aggregates of clustered grains .",
    "for example , the percolated structure of the composites is simulated by `` particles '' with shape factor 0 .",
    "it is easy to show that in the limit when cells of all components of the composites have spherical shape ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , the emt - o rule ( eq . [ eq : epsilon_eff ] ) reduces to the classical bruggeman rule @xcite : @xmath86    the grain emissivities , @xmath24}_{\\lambda}(\\lambda , a)$ ] , were calculated by using the thermal - discrete approximation ( tda ) to the general statistical - mechanical approach developed by @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that the tda is quite good for calculating the overall emission spectrum of very small grains of typical sizes less than about 200  that experience temperature spikes . for larger grains ,",
    "the grain emissivity can be easily calculated by using planck function with the equilibrium grain temperature .    to calculate the energy balance of interstellar dust grains ,",
    "we assume that the dust grains are heated by absorption of photons from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and are cooled via their own emission . the isrf is defined by its mean intensity @xmath87 .",
    "we adopted the empirical representation of @xmath87 for the solar neighborhood from @xcite @xmath88 which includes the uv component , @xmath89 , three effective blackbody sources with dilution factors : @xmath90=10@xmath91 , @xmath92=10@xmath93 , @xmath94=4@xmath9510@xmath93 , and temperatures : @xmath96=7500  k , @xmath97=4000  k , @xmath98=3000  k , and the cosmic microwave background radiation , @xmath99 with its temperature @xmath100=2.73  k @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : int_eq1 ] ) is a fredholm integral equation of first kind , and its solution is a typical ill - posed inverse problem @xcite .",
    "the inversion entails solving for the size distribution function @xmath59 given a set of observations @xmath57 and a kernel @xmath48 which is calculated using an adopted grain model . as a rule , applying a kernel @xmath101 to a function @xmath102",
    "is a smoothing operation .",
    "consequently , the solution can be extremely sensitive to small changes in input data .",
    "many specialized tools have been developed to tackle ill - posed equations .",
    "they utilize a priori information about the solution , such as its continuity , positivity , monotonic behavior , convexity , points of extremum , to name a few .",
    "most popular are the method of regularization @xcite , the backus - gilbert method @xcite , and the maximum entropy method ( mem ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .    to solve our specific problem , equation ( [ eq : int_eq1 ] )",
    ", we prefer to use the method of regularization ( mr ) which requires minimum input information : the data @xmath57 , their uncertainties @xmath61 , and a stabilizing functional .",
    "the stabilizing functional is additional input information . it does not assume a parametric form for the solution , but",
    "it does assume that the solution will have a certain smoothness to it .",
    "in this sense , the mr has an advantage over the mem , which additionally requires a default solution . like the stabilizing functional in the mr ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_s ] below ) , the default serves to find a stable solution in the mem .",
    "however , as a rule , it is practically impossible to guess the default solution in our case , as we will see later in   [ section : results ] .",
    "thus , the solutions derived with the mem are more biased than those derived with the mr .",
    "the mem was used for modeling of interstellar extinction and polarization by kim , martin , & hendry ( 1994 ) , @xcite .",
    "a power law with an exponential cutoff was used as a default solution in all these papers .",
    "the use of such a default was partly justified because the authors performed their calculations largely within the framework of then - standard graphite - silicate model by @xcite which postulates power law grain - size distributions for both components .",
    "however , there are still problems with the default even in this case . for example",
    ", it is not clear how to choose the value of the exponential cutoff parameters that regulate the larger grain - size distribution : figures 2 and 6 from @xcite can best serve to demonstrate the problem . at the same time ,",
    "@xcite and zubko , kreowski , & wegner ( 1996 , 1998 ) have shown that the mr can be successfully applied for modeling of both circumstellar and interstellar extinction .",
    "there is no need for any default solution .",

    "the discrepancy functional @xmath117 resembles ( but does not coincide with ) the reduced @xmath120 function , and the discrepancy rule ( [ eq : dis_rule ] ) reads : @xmath104 =   \\phi_{\\rm{d}}[f^{(\\alpha=0)}(a ) ] + 1        \\label{eq : dis_rule_2}\\ ] ]    the introduction of tikhonov s stabilizer is decisive in finding a mathematically stable and unique solution , that is a well - behaved function that does not have wild oscillations or discontinuities . if we would try to minimize the discrepancy functional @xmath117 itself , when the number of unknown parameters ( the values of function @xmath102 at some discrete grid of grain sizes ) exceeds the number of measurements or observations @xmath111 , we would not obtain a unique solution for @xmath102 : the functional @xmath117 is degenerate in this case .",
    "however , the smoothing functional @xmath121 is always nondegenerate .",

    ", we use the iterative technique of conjugate gradient projections on nonnegative vector set , described in detail by @xcite .",

    "generally , rule ( [ eq : dis_rule ] ) is valid for an incompatible problem ( eq . [ eq : int_eq1 ] ) which has no exact solution : @xmath123 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "this is the case for the models reported here .",
    "we have fit the observational constraints with five different dust compositions , from which we created five different classes of dust models .",
    "the five different dust constituents are : ( 1 ) pahs ; ( 2 ) graphite ; ( 3 ) amorphous carbon of types acar , be , and ach2 ; ( 4 ) silicates , mgfesio@xmath4 ; and ( 5 ) composite particles containing different proportions of silicates , organic refractory material ( c@xmath6h@xmath6o@xmath7n ) , water ice ( h@xmath8o ) , and voids .",
    "these five dust compositions were combined to create five different classes of dust models .",
    "the first class consists of pahs , and bare graphite and silicate grains , identical to the carbonaceous / silicate model recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the second class of models contains in addition to pahs , bare graphite and silicate grains , composite particles .",
    "the third and fourth classes of models comprise of the first and second classes but with the graphite grains completely replaced by amorphous carbon grains . in the fifth class of models",
    "the only carbon is in pahs , that is , it comprises of only pahs , bare silicate , and composite particles .",
    "we designated models including only pahs and bare grains as bare , and those containing additional composite particles as comp .",
    "the bare and comp models were further subdivided according to the composition of the bare carbon particles used in the model : graphite , amorphous carbon , and no carbon , designated respectively by -gr , -ac , and -nc .",
    "for all model classes , we performed the fit using the three different sets of ism abundances listed in table  [ tab_dust_abund ] : solar , b  stars , and f and g  stars ( correspondingly designated as -s , -b , and -fg submodels ) .",
    "so , for example , a bare model with graphite grains derived by assuming the solar ism abundances is designated as bare - gr - s , or a comp model with no carbon obtained by assuming the b star abundances is designated as comp - nc - b .      for computational purposes",
    ", we used a discrete set of wavelengths to calculate @xmath57 : a set of 100 wavelengths equally spaced in @xmath125 between 1/3.0 and 1/0.912 @xmath113 to characterize the extinction ; eight wavelengths at 3.5 , 4.9 , 12 , 25 , 60 , 100 , 140 , and 240  , corresponding to the nominal wavelengths of the dirbe filters , and 93 wavelengths between 160 and 1000 , corresponding to the firas channels , to characterize the ir emission . for each dust component",
    ", we constructed a grid of 30100 grain radii , logarithmically distributed between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we adopted @xmath126=3.5   for pahs , graphite , and silicate grains , because smaller grains are photolytically unstable @xcite .",
    "for composite grains , we performed calculations for larger values of @xmath126=100500   , since composite grains , being aggregates of smaller particles , are a priori expected to be larger . for",
    "the composite grains the results do not depend drastically on @xmath126 , so we adopted @xmath126=200   for these particles .",
    "note that for the grains of sizes larger than 200   , the contribution of temperature fluctuations to the grain energy balance becomes negligible , and we can use the equilibrium temperature approach for calculating the emissivity of the grains . for all components , we chose the upper limit @xmath127=5  , but found that the size distribution is essentially zero for @xmath128 for all the models even with @xmath127 up to 2050  .",
    "the main results of our modeling are shown in figures  [ fig : bare - s - gr][fig : comp - b - nc ] which compare the calculations for the bare and comp models to the observations .",
    "each figure consists of four panels depicting the following results : ( 1 ) the grain - size distributions and their uncertainties for each dust component , which is the main result of the fitting ( inversion ) ; ( 2 ) the calculated extinction curve , with the partial contributions of each dust component ; ( 3 ) the calculated abundances of the different elements in the dust ; and ( 4 ) the calculated emission spectrum along with the contributions of each dust component .    for bare models with graphite grains ,",
    "the main contribution to the uv / optical extinction comes from graphite grains and pahs , whereas silicate grains dominate in the far uv extinction .",
    "the uv bump is explained by both pahs and graphite grains . in emission ,",
    "pahs and graphite grains mostly contribute in the near infrared ( 325 ) , graphite grains prevail for @xmath23=25250 , and the contributions of graphite and silicate grains are comparable for @xmath129  .    for bare models with amorphous carbon , most optical and uv extinction is explained by amorphous carbon grains : this contribution is quite flat .",
    "the far uv slope is provided by small silicate grains and pahs .",
    "the uv bump is solely explained by pahs .",
    "the near infrared emission is due to pahs and silicate grains , the middle infrared ( @xmath23=2560  ) is explained by silicate grains , and the amorphous carbon grains prevail in the far infrared emission for @xmath130  .",
    "comp models with both graphite and amorphous carbon grains have some similarities with the respective bare models .",
    "note however that the composites are one of the main contributors to the optical to far - uv extinction .",
    "emission in the near and mid infrared ( 360 ) is similar to bare models .",
    "however , composites contribute to emission in the far infrared for @xmath131  200  .    for comp models without graphite or amorphous carbon grains ,",
    "composites are dominating contributor to the infrared / optical / uv extinction and far infrared emission .",
    "the uv bump is explained by pahs .",
    "these models generally require less carbon than any other models .",
    "figure [ fig : size_ld01 ] presents the size distribution for the bare - gr - s dust model that comprises of dust particles with identical compositions and optical properties as the @xcite model . for sake of comparison",
    "we also added in the figure the li & draine grain size distributions .",
    "for carbonaceous grains , the li & draine size distribution is tri - modal with a primary peak at around 0.3  , and secondary peaks at about 50 and 5   .",
    "in contrast , our size distribution for the carbonaceous particles is bi - modal , consisting of a graphitic component peaked at @xmath30.1  @xmath2 m , and a pah component , peaked at @xmath315   .",
    "the graphitic component extends to very small grain sizes , representing a population of dehydrated pahs .",
    "the dehydrated pahs are needed to produce the continuum mid - ir emission without the associated pah features .",
    "this mid - ir emission also masks the presence of the 10  @xmath2 m silicate bump that is generated by the very small silicate particles in the bare - gr - s dust model .",
    "the additional @xmath350   bump at the lower limit of the li & draine graphite grain size distribution may reflect the need to produce a featureless mid - ir continuum emission in their model .    the silicate grain size distribution in both",
    ", the li - draine and the bare - gr - s dust models , is essentially a power law with a similar cutoff at large grain sizes .",
    "however , the silicate size distribution in the bare - gr - s model has a shallower slope , similar to that of the mrn model , and consequently contains a larger number of very small silicate particles compared to the li - draine model .",
    "another contribution to the differences in the grain size distribution between the bare - gr - s and the li & draine dust models may be attributed to the fact that @xcite constrained the functional form of their size distributions , and thus did not derive the optimal distributions that fits the observational constraints .    when trying to find the best - fit comp models , we varied the volume fractions of composite grains , including their porosities , to get the mimimum discrepancy .",
    "this resulted in a composite model which has _ mass _ fractions : 0.5 of silicate , 0.457 of organic refractory , and 0.043 of water ice , but with different porosities listed for each model in table [ tab_vol_fr ] . in most cases , the models for a range of porosities 0.200.80 can provide quite good fits .",
    "so , for these cases , we present models for a porosity equal to 0.50 , with two exceptions : ( 1 ) for comp - ac - s , the models fits are good for porosities 0.500.70 , so we chose the model with 0.60 as a representative ; ( 2 ) for comp - gr - b , the models with porosities 00.20 looks better , so we present a model with 0.10 .",
    "we included various types of amorphous carbon in composites while modeling , but we found that in order to get good fits the mass fraction of amorphous carbon should not exceed 1% .",
    "figure [ fig : nk_comp ] demonstrates the optical constants for the composites with porosity 0.50 , derived with the three various mixing rules . also shown",
    "are the optical constants of the composite constituents : silicate , organic refractory , and water ice .",
    "table [ tab_discr ] lists the discrepancies of the models .",
    "it is immediately clear from the table that the overall quality of models is highly dependent on the abundance constraint .",
    "the minimum discrepancy is achieved by the group of models that assume f and g stars ism abundances with the models assuming solar and b star abundances following next .",
    "note that the differences are quite small between the minimum and maximum discrepancies of neighboring groups of models with various abundances , that is between bare - ac - fg and comp - gr - s , and between bare - ac - s and comp - gr - b .",
    "the discrepancies for our models are within the range of 10@xmath712 .",
    "the amorphous carbon in the models listed in the table consist of ach2 type carbon .",
    "we found that it is impossible to get acceptable fits with acar or be type carbon .",
    "generally , each of the models provides acceptable fits to the extinction and emission .",
    "quantitatively , this can be seen from table  [ tab_discr ] by comparing the respective discrepancies .",
    "there are however differences in fitting the abundances in dust .",
    "first of all , the comp models have smaller discrepancies ( @xmath117 ) than their bare counterparts . probably , this is mostly because comp models include one more dust component  composites , and thus more fitting parameters . even the models with",
    "the b stars abundances can provide acceptable fits to the abundances in dust , while still requiring extra carbon beyond one sigma . by comparing the discrepancies from table  [ tab_discr ]",
    ", we can conclude that it is harder to fit b star abundance constraints than the two other sets .",
    "note however that larger abundance uncertainties for f and g stars make it easier to get good fits for this case .",
    "the comp models provide somewhat better fits than their respective bare counterparts .",
    "@xcite adopted an extinction - per - h - atom value that is 1.12 larger than that of our paper .",
    "however , this difference does not account for the large amount of metals consumed in their dust model , because the model was derived by fitting _ both _ the extinction and the emission spectrum .",
    "as a result , the abundance of the dust does not scale simply with the extinction curve . to examine the effect of the extinction curve on the elemental depletions , we calculated the dust abundances for a bare - gr - s model optimized to fit the extinction curve used by @xcite instead of the one used in this paper .",
    "the changes in the dust abundances were quite small , 2.6 and 0.9% for carbon and silicate dust , respectively . from this experiment we expect that a li & draine model fit to the extinction curve used here , will not substantially alter their derived dust abundances .        in table",
    "[ tab_fin_abund ] , we list the quantities of chemical elements , consumed by the models : both total and partial for each dust component .",
    "table  [ tab_mass ] contains the dust - to - gas ratios and the mass per h atom locked up in dust along with the contributions of each dust constituent in per cent .",
    "from the masses per h atom and the constituent mass percentages from table  [ tab_mass ] , one can calculate the abundances of water ice required by our models .",
    "we found that our comp models consume 513 ppm of ice ( 57 for comp - gr models , 711 for comp - ac models , and 1213 for comp - nc models ) .",
    "for comparison , @xcite estimated the upper limit for water ice at the diffuse sightline toward cygnus ob2 no .",
    "12 to be 2  ppm .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this estimate is applicable to other diffuse lines of sight .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig : ir_ext ] ( see  [ section : nir_ext ] ) demonstrates that the near - infrared extinction predicted by our comp models , especially at the wavelengths around the 3.1 and 6 water ice absorption features , is consistent with the observations for a line of sight toward the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we performed analytical approximations for the size distributions of all our models . at first step , the size distribution function @xmath132",
    "( in @xmath2m@xmath113  h@xmath113 ) found in a numerical form was expressed as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a normalization coefficient in h@xmath113 , @xmath11 is in @xmath2 m , and function @xmath135 ( in @xmath2m@xmath113 ) has a property @xmath136 . to analytically approximate numerical values of @xmath135 , we used function @xmath137 : @xmath138 which contains 14 parameters .",
    "note this is a generic expression : we normally used 811 parameters for fitting .",
    "the parameters of @xmath139 were derived by fitting the numerical values of @xmath135 using the nonlinear least - squares marquardt - levenberg algorithm @xcite .",
    "function ( [ eq : logga ] ) contains a power law part : @xmath140 , cutoff terms : @xmath141 , and peaked terms : @xmath142 .",
    "the cutoff and peaked terms are needed to reproduce the deviations of the model size distributions from a power law .    the resulting values of the parameters of the fitting function ( [ eq : logga ] ) are listed in tables  [ f_bare - s - gr][f_comp - b - nc ] .",
    "the tables also contain parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 which define the range of grain radii for which the approximation is valid , the normalization constant @xmath134 , and the reduced @xmath120 characterizing the quality of the analytical approximation .",
    "note that @xmath143 has no relation to the quality of the grain - size distribution model .",
    "most approximations have @xmath143 better than of 0.01 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ir_ext ] , shows the near - infrared extinction curves for the different bare and comp models .",
    "the observed extinction was taken from @xcite who estimated it by using the hydrogen recombination lines detected between 2.5 and 9 towards the galactic center .",
    "generally , the comp models are more consistent with the observed extinction here : the features at around 33.5 and 5.57.0   are mostly due to water ice and organic refractory .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure  [ fig : ir_ext ] that additional dust components should be present , e.g. , other types of silicates , metal oxides or sulphides , co@xmath8 and methane ices ; or else the optical constants for the existing components are bad .",
    "however , currently , it is impossible to involve these species into analysis because of lack of the respective optical constants .",
    "note also that the galactic center line of sight may be very different from the high latitude emission and extinction that were fit , especially with regard to molecular clouds and thus probably composite or multilayer grains .    in figures  [ fig : albedo][fig : aspar ] , we show the scattering properties of our dust models : the albedo , that is the ratio of the mean scattering cross section to the mean extinction cross section ; and phase function asymmetry parameter which is the mean value of the cosine of the scattering angle .",
    "generally , our models give slightly lower values than the observed ones , but the comp models look preferable in comparison to the bare models , especially for the asymmetry parameter .",
    "an important result of our modeling is that the current extinction , ir emission , and interstellar abundance constraints can be simultaneously fit by several different classes of dust models .",
    "one class of models consist of the widely - used pah , bare graphite and silicate grains . with our addition of the abundance constraints we derive a similar carbon abundance in pahs and graphite as @xcite did , but with generally smaller graphite grains and larger pah molecules ( see fig . [",
    "fig : size_ld01 ] ) .",
    "our silicate size distribution turns out to be similar to the mrn distribution , with a shallower slope than the li & draine model .",
    "the peak in our silicate grain size distribution is lower than that in their model , which is why our mg / h , si / h , and fe / h abundance in the dust is only 33 ppm , compared to the @xmath5 50 required in the li & draine model .    a second class of dust models that fits the constraints contains in addition to bare grains , composite particles , such as those believed to have formed and observed to be present in dense molecular clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sizes of the composite particles are generally larger than those of the bare particles .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario in which the ices and organic material of the composite grains accumulated in molecular clouds , producing larger dust aggregates than expected in the diffuse ism .",
    "the presence of such particles in the diffuse ism would imply that their volatile components survive the harsher radiation field in that environment .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the volatile compounds may have accreted in protected areas of the dust particles , that the large size of the composite grains prevents surges in their temperature which would evaporate the volatiles , and that the volatiles may have been reprocessed by uv radiation into a more refractory component . in our future works , we hope to include other volatile materials , e.g. icy methane , ammonia , carbon dioxide , and other oxides , when the respective optical constants are measured in laboratory .",
    "we also presented a class of bare and comp models in which graphite is completely replaced by hydrogenated amorphous carbon . in these models , pahs are the only contributor to the uv extinction bump at 2175  .",
    "these models are motivated by the fact that the highly ordered structure of graphite is unlikely to form in circumstellar environments , and survive in the diffuse ism , making amorphous carbon grains more atractive alternative @xcite .",
    "we note that the discrepancies of models containing amorphous carbon are generally larger than those containing graphite , which may be due to the fact that their optical constants were not optimized to fit astronomical observations .",
    "in contrast , the optical constants for `` astronomical '' graphite and `` astronomical '' silicate used in this study have been basically derived by @xcite by fitting laboratory measurements and interstellar extinction law , using the mrn model of graphite and silicate grains with a power - law size distribution .",
    "so , it should not be surprising that dust models without graphite will not provide as good a fit as those that do .",
    "a final class of models contains no carbon at all , except for that present in pahs , and in the organic constituent of the composite particles .",
    "this model was motivated by the desire to fit the lowest available carbon abundance in dust if the ism had b star abundances .",
    "the model , designated comp - nc - b , consumes less carbon , c / h @xmath5 196 ppm , compared to models comp - gr - b ( c / h @xmath5 240 ppm ) or comp - ac - b ( c / h @xmath5 207 ppm ) ( table  [ tab_fin_abund ] ) .",
    "this class of models is made possible by the fact that the absorption cross sections of a mixture of `` astronomical '' pahs were adjusted by @xcite to fit the uv extinction bump at 2175  .",
    "these are idealized cross sections which ignore substructures in the measured uv absorption of the pah mixtures @xcite .",
    "since several classes of dust models fit the observed extinction , ir emission , and elemental abundances , any linear combination of these models will provide equally good fits to these constraints .",
    "this provides a wide range of latitude in the construction of evolutionary models in which dust cycles between the various ism phases , allowing for spatial variations in dust composition and size distribution in the diffuse ism without significantly affecting the average extinction .",
    "we have taken an additional step in the characterization of interstellar dust particles , by simultaneopusly fitting their interstellar extinction , diffuse ir emission , and interstellar abundance constraints .",
    "we used dust constituents with physical optical constants and properties to characterize the components of the dust model : pahs , silicates , graphite , amorphous carbon , and composite particles .",
    "given the observational constraints and the dust consituents and properties , we used the method of regularization to solve for the optimal grain size distribution of each dust component .      1 .",
    "we found that bare grain ( bare ) models ( pahs + graphite + silicate or pahs + amorphous carbon + silicate ) provide good simultaneous fits to the far - uv to near - ir extinction , thermal ir emission , and elemental abundance constraints .",
    "somewhat improved fits to the observational constraints are obtained by the composite grain ( comp ) models , through the addition of composite grains ( silicate + organic refractory + water ice + voids ) to the bare grain model .",
    "the comp - gr - fg model provides the best fit to the extinction and ir emission if the ism has f and g stars abundances .",
    "the model also provides a good match to the observed infrared extinction and scattering properties : albedo and asymmetry parameter .",
    "4 .   the results of our calculations show that it is harder to fit the b star abundances than the solar or f and g star abundances .",
    "thus , we can conclude that solar or f and g star abundances for diffuse interstellar medium look preferable .",
    "the results of our modeling demonstrate that there is no unique dust model that fits the extinction , ir emission , and elemental abundances constraints .",
    "we believe that adding more constraints , such as interstellar polarization could narrow the set of viable dust models .",
    "preliminary calculations show that haloes produced by small angle x - ray scattering can discriminate between the different dust models , favoring bare over comp models , which have a larger population of big particles @xcite .",

    "<S> we present new interstellar dust models which have been derived by simultaneously fitting the far  ultraviolet to near  infrared extinction , the diffuse infrared ( ir ) emission and , unlike previous models , the elemental abundance constraints on the dust for different interstellar medium abundances , including solar , f and g star , and b star abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting problem is a typical ill - posed inversion problem , in which the grain size distribution is the unknown , which we solve by using the method of regularization . </S>",
    "<S> the dust model contains various components : pahs , bare silicate , graphite , and amorphous carbon particles , as well as composite particles containing silicate , organic refractory material , water ice , and voids . </S>",
    "<S> the optical properties of these components were calculated using physical optical constants . as a special case , </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the li & draine ( 2001 ) results , however their model requires an excessive amount of silicon , magnesium , and iron to be locked up in dust : about 50 ppm ( atoms per million of h atoms ) , significantly more than the upper limit imposed by solar abundances of these elements , about 34 , 35 , and 28 ppm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a major conclusion of this paper is that there is no unique interstellar dust model that simultaneously fits the observed extinction , diffuse ir emission , and abundances constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we find several classes of acceptable interstellar dust models , that comply with these constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the first class is identical in composition to the li & draine model , consisting of pahs , bare graphite and silicate grains , but with a different size distribution that is optimized to comply with the abundances constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the second class of models contains in addition to pahs bare graphite and silicate grains also composite particles . </S>",
    "<S> other classes contain amorphous carbon instead of graphite particles , or no carbon at all , except for that in pahs . </S>",
    "<S> all classes are consistent with solar and f & g star abundances , but have greater difficulty fitting the b star carbon abundance , which is better fit with the latter ( no carbon ) models . additional observational constraints , such as the interstellar polarization , or x  ray scattering may be able to discriminate between the various interstellar dust models . </S>"
