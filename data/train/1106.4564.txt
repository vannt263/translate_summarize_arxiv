    "heavy - ion collisions at the relativistc heavy ion collider ( rhic ) indicate the production of an opaque ( i.e.  strongly jet - suppressing ) @xcite , fast - thermalizing medium .",
    "however , so far neither the initial conditions of the collisions nor the microscopic dynamics of the jet - energy loss are conclusively understood .    to characterize the initial conditions , one usually uses either the glauber model , describing incoherent superpositions of proton - proton collisions , or the `` color glass condensate '' ( cgc ) , given e.g.  by the kln model , where saturation effects are taken into account @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet - energy loss can either be described as multiple scatterings of the hard parton @xcite , specific of a weakly - coupled pqcd medium , or using the ads / cft correspondence where the problem of a parton stopped in a thermal medium is related to the problem of a string falling into a @xmath2-dimensional black hole @xcite .",
    "focussing on the different path - length dependences of @xmath3 for pqcd @xcite ( as it occurs in the presence of coherence effects like in the high - density lpm limit ) and @xmath4 for ads / cft calculations @xcite , the first simple jet absorption model that simultaneously describes the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 at rhic energies for high-@xmath0 particles was given in refs .",
    "it showed that after fixing the coupling such that the most central data point for @xmath1 is reproduced , the @xmath5 can be described for both pqcd and ads / cft - like energy loss .",
    "however , in case of a pqcd - like energy loss , the @xmath6 is underpredicted for both glauber and cgc initial conditions , while for an ads / cft - like energy loss and cgc initial conditions , the @xmath6 can be well described .",
    "here we want to examine if a generic energy - loss ansatz that includes both a path - length and an energy dependence confirms the above conclusion that only cgc / kln initial conditions and an ads / cft energy - loss can describe both the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 appropriately .",
    "since all dependences on the intrinsic scales of the system ( @xmath7 , etc . ) disappear in the high - temperature limit , a generic energy - loss rate @xmath8 is given by an arbitrary combination of dimensionful parameters constrained by the total dimension of the observable and the requirement that faster particles and hotter media result in a bigger suppression .",
    "we choose @xcite @xmath9 , \\label{genericeloss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the coupling , @xmath11 is the momentum of the jet(s ) considered and @xmath12 are parameters controlling the jet energy ( momentum ) and path - length dependence , respectively . in the bethe - heitler limit @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while in the deep lpm pqcd limit @xmath15 and @xmath16 . if @xmath17 and @xmath18 , our model coincides with the model referred to as `` ads / cft '' in refs .",
    "however , on - shell ads / cft calculations @xcite show that @xmath19 and @xmath18 , thus we are going to consider @xmath19 throughout the whole paper . in a static medium , @xmath20 , while in a dynamic medium , @xmath8 will aquire additional powers of @xmath21 due to the dependence of temperature on @xmath21 . here",
    ", we assume a @xmath22d bjorken expansion .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "it is always fitted to reproduce the most central value for @xmath1 at rhic energies .",
    "choosing @xmath23  fm , in line with recent hydrodynamic calculations @xcite , we see ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that cgc / kln initial conditions get close to the rhic data for both pqcd and ads / cft - like energy loss , while glauber initial conditions underpredict the data .",
    "however , choosing a much smaller @xmath24 ( in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath25  fm ) , the @xmath6 is reduced for both pqcd and ads / cft - like energy loss , increasing the difference between the pqcd and ads / cft results as seen in refs .",
    "@xcite , and raising the question of the physical meaning of @xmath24 .",
    "setting @xmath23  fm means to assume that there is no energy loss within the first fm .",
    "pqcd does not give any excuse for this assumption and thus @xmath25  fm would be a natural assumption .",
    "however , @xmath24 also describes the formation time of hydrodynamics which seems to be @xmath26  fm @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "setting @xmath23  fm is also equivalent to the ads / cft result that the energy loss is suppressed at early times .",
    "please note that for ads / cft the @xmath27 dependence leads to a suppressed energy loss at early times where the suppression is larger than in the pqcd case with @xmath28 .",
    "thus , it is important to see that the @xmath29 of high-@xmath0 particles is sensitive to short - distance properties , suggesting that there is either weak coupling with a @xmath26  fm or strong coupling which in itself features the suppression of energy loss at early times .    calculating the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow for pions at lhc energies while keeping the values for @xmath30 and @xmath10 fixed compared to rhic energies , leads to an underprediction of the @xmath1 as a function of centrality as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for both pqcd and ads / cft - like energy loss and different values of the initialization time @xmath24 .",
    "this is a puzzle common to all density - dependent energy - loss prescriptions [ cf .",
