    "absorption from layers of photo - ionized gas in the circumnuclear regions of agn is commonly observed in more than half of radio - quiet objects , the so - called warm absorbers ( e.g. , blustin et al .",
    "2005 ; mckernan et al .",
    "these absorbers are usually detected in the x - ray spectra at energies below @xmath823  kev .",
    "the typical characteristics of this material are an ionization parameter of log@xmath902  erg  s@xmath3  cm , a column density of @xmath4@xmath8@xmath10@xmath5  @xmath7 and an outflow velocity of @xmath81001000  km / s .",
    "it has been suggested that the origin of this gas might be connected with the optical - uv broad line region or with torus winds ( e.g. , blustin et al .",
    "2005 ; mckernan et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "in addition , there have been several papers in the literature recently reporting the detection of blue - shifted fe k absorption lines at rest - frame energies of @xmath8710  kev in the x - ray spectra of radio - quiet agn ( e.g. , chartas et al .",
    "2002 ; chartas et al .  2003 ; pounds et al .  2003",
    "; dadina et al .  2005 ; markowitz et al .  2006 ; braito et al .  2007 ; cappi et al .  2009 ; reeves et al .",
    "these lines are commonly interpreted as due to resonant absorption from fe xxv and/or fe xxvi associated with a zone of circumnuclear gas photo - ionized by the central x - ray source , with ionization parameter log@xmath2@xmath835  erg  s@xmath3  cm and column density @xmath4@xmath8@xmath5@xmath11  @xmath7 .",
    "the energies of these absorption lines are systematically blue - shifted and the corresponding velocities can reach up to mildly relativistic values of @xmath80.20.4c . in particular , a uniform and systematic search for blue - shifted fe k absorption lines in a large sample of radio - quiet agn observed with xmm - newton has been performed by tombesi et al .",
    "this allowed the authors to assess their global detection significance and to overcome any possible publication bias ( e.g. , vaughan & uttley 2008 ) .",
    "the lines were detected in @xmath840% of the objects , and are systematically blue - shifted implying large outflow velocities , even larger than 0.1c in @xmath825% of the sources .",
    "these findings , corroborated by the observation of short time - scale variability ( @xmath8100  ks ) , indicate that the absorbing material is outflowing from the nuclear regions of agn , at distances of the order of @xmath8100  @xmath12 ( schwarzschild radii , @xmath13 ) from the central super - massive black hole ( e.g. , cappi et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , these findings suggest the presence of previously unknown ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ) from the central regions of radio - quiet agn , possibly connected with accretion disk winds / ejecta ( e.g. , king & pounds 2003 ; proga & kallman 2004 ; ohsuga et al .  2009 ; king 2010 ) or the base of a possible weak jet ( see the `` aborted jet '' model by ghisellini et al .",
    "the mass outflow rate of these ufos can be comparable to the accretion rate and their kinetic energy can correspond to a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( e.g. , pounds et al .",
    "2003 ; dadina et al .",
    "2005 ; markowitz et al .  2006 ;",
    "braito et al .",
    "2007 ; cappi et al .  2009",
    "; reeves et al .",
    "therefore , they have the possibility to bring outward a significant amount of mass and energy , which can have an important influence on the surrounding environment ( e.g. , see review by cappi 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , feedback from the agn is expected to have a significant role in the evolution of the host galaxy , such as the enrichment of the ism or the reduction of star formation , and could also explain some fundamental relations ( e.g. , see review by elvis 2006 and fabian 2009 ) . moreover",
    ", the ejection of a substantial amount of mass from the central regions of agn can also inhibit the growth of the super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , potentially affecting their evolution .",
    "the study of ufos can also give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds / jets .",
    "evidence for winds / outflows in radio - loud agn in the x - rays has been missing so far .",
    "however , thanks to the superior sensitivity and energy resolution of current x - ray detectors , we are now beginning to find evidence for outflowing gas in radio - loud agn as well .",
    "in fact , the recent detection of a warm absorber in the broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) 3c  382 ( torresi et al .  2010 ; reeves et al .",
    "2009b ) has been the starting point for a change to the classical picture of the radio - quiet vs. radio - loud dichotomy , at least in the x - ray domain .",
    "this gas has an ionization parameter of log@xmath1423  erg  s@xmath3  cm , a column density of @xmath4@xmath1@xmath15@xmath5  @xmath7 and is outflowing with a velocity of @xmath88001000  km / s .",
    "these parameters are somewhat similar to those of the typical warm absorbers of seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , blustin et al .  2005 ; mckernan et al .",
    "2007 ) , which are the radio - quiet counterparts of blrgs .",
    "this result indicates the presence of ionized outflowing gas in a radio - loud agn at a distance of @xmath8100  pc from the central engine , suggesting its possible association with the optical - uv narrow line region ( torresi et al .  2010 ; reeves et al .",
    "2009b ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present the detection , for the first time , of ionized ultra - fast outflows in blrgs _ on sub - pc scales _ from suzaku observations .",
    "the sources in the sample ",
    "3c  111 , 3c  390.3 , 3c  120 , 3c  382 , and 3c  445  were observed with suzaku by us as part of our ongoing systematic study of the x - ray properties of blrgs ( sambruna et al .",
    "2009 ) , with the exception of 3c  120 which was observed during the guaranteed time observer period ( kataoka et al .",
    "these five blrgs represent the `` classical '' x - ray brightest radio - loud agn , well studied at x - rays with previous observatories .",
    "thanks to the high sensitivity of the xis detectors and the long net exposures of these observations of @xmath8100  ks , we have been able to reach a high s / n in the fe k band that allowed , for the first time , to obtain evidence for ufos in these sources , in the form of blue - shifted fe  k absorption lines at energies greater than 7  kev .",
    "the presence of ufos in radio - loud agn provides a confirmation of models for jet - disk coupling and stresses the importance of this class of sources for agn feedback mechanisms .",
    "full accounts of the broad - band suzaku spectra for each source will be given in forthcoming papers .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in   2 and ",
    "3 we describe the suzaku data reduction and analysis , including statistical tests used to assess the reality of the fe  k absorption features (   3.3 ) and detailed photo - ionization models used for the fits (   3.4 ) .",
    "the general results are given in   4 , while   5 presents the discussion with the conclusions following in ",
    "appendix a contains the details of the spectral fits for each blrg and appendix b a consistency check of the results . throughout this paper , a concordance cosmology with h@xmath16 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath17=0.73 , and @xmath18=0.27 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) is adopted .",

    "the photon index is @xmath21 .",
    "the observational details for the five blrgs observed with suzaku ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the data were taken from the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis , koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) and processed using v2 of the suzaku pipeline .",
    "the observations were taken with the xis nominal ( on - axis ) pointing position , with the exception of the 3c  111 observation , which was taken with hxd nominal pointing .",
    "the suzaku observation of 3c  120 is composed by four different exposures of @xmath840  ks each , taken over a period of about one month ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we looked at the individual spectra and found that while observation 2 , 3 and 4 did not change significantly overall , observation 1 instead showed a stronger x - ray emission , especially in the soft x - ray part of the spectrum , in agreement with kataoka et al .",
    "therefore , we decided to add only observations 2 , 3 and 4 ( we will call this observation 3c  120b ) and to analyze the spectrum of observation 1 separately ( we will call this observation 3c  120a ) .",
    "data were excluded within 436 seconds of passage through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and within earth elevation angles or bright earth angles of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "xis data were selected in @xmath24 and @xmath25 edit - modes using grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , while hot and flickering pixels were removed using the sisclean script .",
    "spectra were extracted from within circular regions of between 2.53.0 radius , while background spectra were extracted from circles offset from the source and avoiding the chip corners containing the calibration sources .",
    "the response matrix ( rmf ) and ancillary response ( arf ) files were created using the tasks xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen , respectively , the former accounting for the ccd charge injection and the latter for the hydrocarbon contamination on the optical blocking filter .",
    "spectra from the front illuminated xis  0 , xis  2 ( where available ) and xis  3 chips were combined to create a single source spectrum ( hereafter xis - fi ) . given its superior sensitivity in the region of interest , 3.510.5  kev , we restricted our analysis to the xis - fi data .",
    "the data from the back illuminated xis  1 ( hereafter xis - bi ) chip were analysed separately and checked for consistency with the xis - fi results . in all cases , the power - law continuum and fe k@xmath19 emission line parameters",
    "are completely consistent .",
    "instead , the lower s / n of the xis - bi in the 410  kev band ( @xmath840% of the xis - fi ) allowed us to place only lower limits to the equivalent width of the blue - shifted absorption lines ( see appendix b and table  5 ) .",
    "furthermore , appendix b gives more details on the various consistency checks we have performed in order to verify the reality of the absorption lines detected in the 710  kev band . in particular , we determined that the xis background has a negligible effect on the detection of each of the individual absorption lines and we checked the consistency of the results among the individual xis cameras ( see table  5 ) .",
    "we also tested that the alternative modeling of the lines with ionized ni k - shell transitions and ionized fe k edges is not feasible .",
    "finally , in  4.2 we verified the fit results from the broad - band ( e@xmath260.550  kev ) xis@xmath27pin spectra .",
    "we performed a uniform spectral analysis of the small sample of five blrgs in the fe k band ( e@xmath263.510.5  kev ) .",
    "we used the _ heasoft _ v. 6.5.1 package and xspec v. 11.3.2 .",
    "we extracted the source spectra for all the observations , subtracted the corresponding background and grouped the data to a minimum of 25 counts per energy bin to enable the use of the @xmath28 when performing spectral fitting .",
    "fits were limited to the 3.510.5  kev energy band .      as plausible phenomenological representation of the continuum in 3.510.5  kev , we adopt a single power - law model",
    ". we did not find it necessary to include neutral absorption from our own galaxy as the relatively low column densities involved ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) have negligible effects in the considered energy band , see table  1 .",
    "the only exception is 3c  445 , where the continuum is intrinsically absorbed by a column density of neutral / mildly - ionized gas as high as @xmath4@xmath8@xmath6  @xmath7 ( sambruna , reeves & braito 2007 ) ; for this source we included also a neutral intrinsic absorption component with a column density of @xmath4@xmath1@xmath29  @xmath7 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of absorption in this source using chandra and suzaku data is presented in reeves et al .",
    "( 2010 , in prep . ) and braito et al .",
    "( 2010 , in prep . )",
    ".    the ratios of the spectral data against the simple ( absorbed for 3c  445 ) power - law continuum for the five blrgs are shown in the upper panels of fig .  1 , fig .  3 and fig .  5 .",
    "some additional spectral complexity can be clearly seen , such as an ubiquitous , prominent neutral fe k@xmath19 emission line at the rest frame energy of 6.4  kev , absorption structures at energies greater than 7  kev ( 3c  111 , 3c  120 , and 3c  390.3 ) and narrow emission features red - ward ( 3c  445 ) and blue - ward ( 3c  120 and 3c  382 ) to the neutral fe k@xmath19 line . to model the emission lines we added gaussian components to the power law model , including the fe k@xmath19 emission line at e@xmath16.4  kev and ionized fe  k emission lines in the energy range e@xmath86.47  kev , depending on the ionization state of iron , which in this energy interval is expected to range from fe  ii up to fe  xxvi .",
    "we find that the baseline model composed by a power - law plus gaussian fe k emission lines provides an excellent phenomenological characterization of the 3.510.5  kev xis data with the lowest number of free parameters .",
    "the results of the fits for the five blrgs are reported in table  2 .",
    "note that only those emission lines with detection confidence levels greater than 99% were retained in following fits .",
    "the weak red - shifted emission line present in 3c  445 was not included because this has negligible effect on the fit results ; this line will be discussed by braito et al .",
    "( 2010 in prep . ) .      as apparent from figure  1 , 3 , and 5 ,",
    "several absorption dips are present in the residuals of the baseline model in various cases . to quantify their significance",
    ", we computed the @xmath30 deviations with respect to the baseline model (   3.1 ) over the whole 3.510.5  kev interval .",
    "the method is similar to the one used by the _",
    "steppar _ command in xspec to visualize the error contours , but in this case the inner contours indicate higher significance than the outer ones ( e.g. , miniutti & fabian 2006 ; miniutti et al .  2007 ; cappi et al .  2009 ; tombesi et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the analysis has been carried out for each source spectrum as follows : 1 ) we first fitted the 3.510.5  kev data with the baseline model and stored the resulting @xmath28 ; 2 ) a further narrow , unresolved ( @xmath3110  ev ) gaussian test line was then added to the model , with its normalization free to have positive or negative values .",
    "its energy was stepped in the 410  kev band at intervals of 100  ev in order to properly sample the xis energy resolution , each time making a fit and storing the resulting @xmath28 value . in this way we derived a grid of @xmath28 values and",
    "then plot the contours with the same @xmath30 with respect to the baseline model .",
    "the contour plots for the different sources are reported in the lower panel of figures  1 , 3 and 5 .",
    "the contours refer to @xmath30 levels of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which correspond to f - test confidence levels of 68% ( red ) , 90% ( green ) and 99% ( blue ) , respectively .",
    "the position of the neutral fe k@xmath19 emission line at rest - frame energy e@xmath266.4  kev is marked by the dotted vertical line .",
    "the arrows indicate the position of the blue - shifted absorption lines detected at @xmath3599% .",
    "the black contours indicate the baseline model reference level ( @xmath36 ) .    we then proceeded to directly fit the spectra , adding gaussian absorption lines where indications for line - like absorption features with confidence levels greater than 99% were present . as already noted in  3.1 , we checked that neglecting to include the weak red - shifted emission line apparent only in the spectrum of 3c  445 has no effect in the fit results .",
    "the detailed fitting and modeling of the fe k absorption lines is reported in table  3 and is discussed in the appendix a for each source .",
    "the contour plots in the lower panels of fig .  1 , fig .  3 and fig .  5",
    "visualize the presence of spectral structures in the data and simultaneously give an idea of their energy , intensity and confidence levels using the standard f - test .",
    "however , they give only a semi - quantitative indication and the detection of each line must be confirmed by directly fitting the spectra .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the f - test method can slightly overestimate the actual detection significance for a blind search of emission / absorption lines as it does not take into account the possible range of energies where a line might be expected to occur , nor does it take into account the number of bins ( resolution elements ) present over that energy range ( e.g. , protassov et al .",
    "this problem requires an additional test on the red / blue - shifted lines significance and can be solved by determining the unknown underlying statistical distribution by performing extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations ( e.g. , porquet et al .",
    "2004 ; yaqoob & serlemitsos 2005 ; miniutti & fabian 2006 ; markowitz et al .  2006 ; cappi et al .  2009 ; tombesi et al .",
    "2010 ) .    therefore , we performed detailed mc simulations to estimate the actual significance of the absorption lines detected at energies greater than 7  kev .",
    "we essentially tested the null hypothesis that the spectra were adequately fitted by a model that did not include the absorption lines .",
    "the simulations have been carried out as follows : 1 ) we simulated a source spectrum using the _ fakeit _ command in xspec and assuming the baseline model listed in table  2 without any absorption lines and with the same exposure as the real data .",
    "we subtracted the appropriate background and grouped the data to a minimum of 25 counts per energy bin ; 2 ) we fitted the faked spectrum with the baseline model in the 3.510.5  kev band , stored the new parameters values and generated another simulated spectrum as in step 2 but using the refined model .",
    "this procedure accounts for the uncertainty in the null hypothesis model itself and is particularly relevant when the original data set is noisy ; 3 ) the newly simulated spectrum was fitted again with the baseline model in the 3.510.5  kev and the resultant @xmath28 was stored ; 4 ) then , a further gaussian line ( unresolved , @xmath3110  ev ) was added to the model , with its normalization initially set to zero and let free to vary between positive and negative values . to account for the range of energies in which the line could be detected in a blind search , we stepped its centroid energy between 7  kev and 10  kev at intervals of 100  ev to sample the xis energy resolution , fitting each time and storing only the maximum of the resultant @xmath30 values .",
    "the procedure was repeated @xmath37 times and consequently a distribution of simulated @xmath30 values was generated .",
    "the latter indicates the fraction of random generated emission / absorption features in the 710  kev band that are expected to have a @xmath30 greater than a threshold value . in particular , if @xmath38 of the simulated @xmath30 values are greater or equal to the real value , then the estimated detection confidence level from mc simulations is simply @xmath39 .",
    "the mc detection probabilities for the absorption lines are given in table  3 .",
    "the values are in the range between 91% and 99.9% .",
    "as expected , these estimates are slightly lower than those derived from the f - test ( @xmath3599% ) because they effectively take into account the random generated lines in the whole 710  kev energy interval .      to model the absorbing material that is photo - ionized by the nuclear radiation , a grid with the xstar code ( kallman & bautista 2001 ) was generated .",
    "we modeled the nuclear x - ray ionizing continuum with a power - law with photon index @xmath40 , as usually assumed for seyfert galaxies , which takes into account the possible steeper soft excess component ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "a different choice of the power - law slope in the range @xmath41@xmath261.52.5 has negligible effects ( @xmath425% ) on the parameter estimates in the considered fe k band , e@xmath263.510.5  kev .",
    "moreover , as already noted by mckernan et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , the presence or absence of the possible uv - bump in the sed has a negligible effect on the parameters of the photo - ionized gas in the fe k band because in this case the main driver is the ionizing continuum in the hard x - rays ( e@xmath436  kev ) .",
    "standard solar abundances are assumed throughout ( grevesse et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the velocity broadening of absorption lines from the photo - ionized absorbers in the central regions of seyfert galaxies is dominated by the turbulence velocity component , commonly assumed to be in the range @xmath81001000  km / s ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ; risaliti et al .  2005 ; cappi et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the energy resolution of the xis instruments in the fe k band is fwhm@xmath8100200  ev , implying that lines with velocity broadening lower than @xmath820004000  km / s are unresolved .",
    "therefore , given that we can not estimate the velocity broadening of the lines directly from the spectral data , we generated an xstar grid assuming the most likely value for the turbulent velocity of the gas of 500  km / s .",
    "we checked that for higher choices of this parameter , the resultant estimate of the ionization parameter was not affected , although the derived absorber column density was found to be slightly lower .",
    "this is due to the fact that the core of the line tends to saturate at higher @xmath4 , with increasing the velocity broadening ( e.g. , bianchi et al .",
    "the opposite happens for lower choices of the turbulent velocity .",
    "however , the resulting difference of @xmath8510% in the derived values is completely negligible and well within the measurement errors .",
    "therefore , we apply this photo - ionization grid to model directly the different absorption lines detected in the fe k band",
    ". the free parameters of the model are the absorber column density @xmath4 , the ionization parameter @xmath2 and the velocity shift @xmath0 .",
    "we let the code find the best - fit values and it turned out that the gas is systematically outflowing , with velocities consistent with those derived from the gaussian absorption lines fits ( see  3.2 and appendix a for a detailed discussion of each source ) .",
    "the xstar parameters are reported in table  4 and the best - fit models are shown in fig .  2 and fig .  4 .",
    "a consistency check of the results from a broad - band spectral analysis is reported in  4.2 .",
    "in this section we summarize the results of the spectral fits to the 3.510.5  kev xis - fi spectra of the blrgs of our sample with a model consisting of the baseline model plus absorption lines and a detailed photoionization grid ( see above ) .",
    "results for individual sources are discussed in appendix a.    the results of the fits with the baseline model are listed in table  2 , while the residuals of this model are shown in figures  1 , 3 , and 5 for the five blrgs , together with the @xmath30 contours . as mentioned above ,",
    "absorption dips are visible and to assess their statistical significance we used both the f - test and extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results of these tests , reported in table  3 , establish that only in 3/5 sources we do detect reliably absorption features at energies @xmath8 7.37.5  kev and 8.18.7  kev , namely in 3c  111 , 3c  120b , and 3c  390.3 . in these three sources ,",
    "the absorption lines are detected with confidence levels higher than 99% with the f - test and higher than 91% with the monte carlo method ( table  3 ) .",
    "we fitted the absorption features by adding narrow gaussian components , or a blend of narrow components , to the baseline model .",
    "the gaussian parameters are reported in table  3 .",
    "given the high cosmic abundance of fe , the most intense spectral features expected from a highly ionized absorber in the 3.510.5  kev band are the k - shell resonances of fe xxv and fe xxvi ( e.g. , kallman et al .  2004 ) . however , the rest - frame energies of the detected absorption lines are in the range @xmath17.37.5  kev and @xmath18.18.8  kev , larger than the expected energies of the atomic transitions for fe xxv and fe xxvi .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the absorption lines detected in the blrgs are due , similarly to those recently observed in seyferts , to blueshifted resonant lines of highly ionized fe , thus implying the presence of fast outflows in radio - loud agn as well .",
    "if we hold this interpretation true , the derived outflow velocities are in the range @xmath10.040.15c .",
    "we also performed more physically consistent spectral fits using the xstar photoionization grid described in   3.4",
    "( see fig .  2 and fig .",
    "good fits are obtained with this model , yielding ionization parameters log@xmath2@xmath145.6  erg  s@xmath3  cm and column densities @xmath4@xmath1@xmath5@xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "the derived blue - shifted velocities are consistent with those from the simple phenomenological fits , @xmath0@xmath10.040.15c ( see table  4 ) .",
    "we note that , given the very high ionization level of this absorbing material , no other significant signatures are expected at lower energies as all the elements lighter than iron are almost completely ionized .",
    "an important caveat is that the velocities and column densities derived by fitting the spectral data with the xstar grid depend on the unknown inclination angle of the outflow with respect to the line of sight . in other words",
    ", they depend on whether we are actually looking directly down to the outflowing stream or intercepting only part of it ( e.g. , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , the obtained values ( see table  4 ) are only conservative estimates and represent lower limits .    in conclusion , we detected for the first time in radio - loud agn at x - rays , absorption lines in the energy range 710  kev in the suzaku xis spectra of 3/5 blrgs  3c  111 , 3c  390.3 , and 3c  120 .",
    "if interpreted as blueshifted resonant absorption lines of highly ionized fe , the features imply the presence of ultra - fast ( v @xmath8 0.04 - 0.15c ) outflows in the central regions of blrgs . in  5 we discuss more in depth this association and the inferred outflow physical properties .",
    "as a consistency check of the fe k band ( e@xmath263.510.5  kev ) based results , we exploited the broad - band capabilities of suzaku combining the xis and pin spectra .",
    "the energy band covered in this way is very broad , from 0.5  kev up to 50  kev .",

    "2007 ) and pg  1211 + 143 ( from pounds et al .  2003 ) .",
    "notably , the authors have been able to account for both emission and absorption features in a physically self - consistent way and demonstrated that accretion disk winds / outflows might well imprint also other spectral signatures in the x - ray spectra of agn ( e.g. , pounds & reeves 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "hydrodynamic wind simulations are highly inhomogeneous in density , column and ionization and have strong rotational velocity components .",
    "therefore the outflow , especially in its innermost regions , is rather unstable .",
    "in particular , the outflow properties through the transition region show considerable variability and this is expected to be reflected by the spectral features associated with this region , i.e. by the corresponding blue - shifted fe xxv / xxvi k - shell absorption lines .",

    ". this can indeed be the case for some of the ufos discussed here ( i.e. , 3c  111 ) .",
    "this overall picture is also partially in agreement with what predicted by the `` aborted jet '' model by ghisellini et al .",
    "this model was actually proposed to explain , at least in part , the high - energy emission in radio - quiet quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "it postulates that outflows and jets are produced by every black hole accretion system .",
    "blobs of material can then be ejected intermittently and can sometimes only travel for a short radial distance and eventually fall back , colliding with others approaching .",
    "therefore , the flow can manifest itself as erratic high - velocity ejections of gas from the inner disk and it is expected that some outflows / blobs are not fast enough to escape the system and will eventually fall back onto the disk .",
    "an intriguing possibility could be that these outflows are generated by localized ejection of material from the outer regions of a bubbling corona , which emits the bulk of the x - ray radiation ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , in analogy with what observed in the solar corona during the coronal mass ejection events ( e.g. , low 1996 ) .",
    "the velocity and frequency of these strong events should then be limited to some extent , in order not to cause the disruption or evaporation of the corona itself .",
    "such extreme phenomena could then be the signatures of the turbulent environment close to the super - massive black hole .",
    "the detection of ufos in both radio - quiet and radio - loud galaxies suggests a similarity of their central engines and demonstrates that the presence of strong relativistic jets do not exclude the existence of winds / outflows from the putative accretion disk .",

    "( 2010 ) and reeves et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that a warm absorber is indeed present also in blrgs ( in particular 3c  382 ) and this indicates that jets and slower winds / outflows can coexist in the same source , even beyond the broad - line region .",

    "therefore , the fact that for blrgs we are observing down to the outflowing stream at intermediate angles to the jet ( @xmath81530@xmath145 ; e.g. , eracleous & halpern 1998 ) suggests that the fast winds / outflows we observe are at greater inclination angles with respect to the jet axis , somewhat similar to what expected for accretion disk winds ( e.g. , proga & kallman 2004 ) .",
    "these outflows would then not be able to undergo the processes which instead accelerate the jet particles to velocities close to the speed of light .",
    "for instance , studies of galactic stellar - mass black holes , or micro - quasars , showed that wind formation occurs in competition with jets , i.e. winds carry away matter halting their flow into jets ( e.g. , neilsen & lee 2009 ) .",
    "given the well - known analogy between micro - quasars and their super - massive relatives , one would naively expect a similar relationship for radio - loud agn .",
    "the blrgs 3c  111 and 3c  120 are regularly monitored in the radio and x - ray bands with the vlba and rxte as part of a project aimed at studying the disk - jet connection ( e.g. , marscher et al  2002 ) .",
    "we have detected ufos in both of these sources ( see table  4 ) , and indeed in both cases the 410  kev fluxes measured with suzaku corresponded to historical low(est ) states if compared to the rxte long - term light curves .",
    "for instance , correlated spectroscopic observations of 3c  111 , where the shortest variability timescales are predicted ( t@xmath87 days ) , during low and high jet continuum states could provide , in a manner analogous to micro - quasars , valuable information on the synergy among disk , jet , and outflows , and go a long way towards elucidating the physics of accretion / ejection in radio - loud agn .",
    "however , whether it is possible to accelerate such ultra - fast outflows with velocities up to @xmath80.15c only through uv line - driving is unclear .",
    "moreover , the material needs to be shielded from the high x - ray ionizing flux in the inner regions of agn , otherwise it would become over - ionized and the efficiency of this process would be drastically reduced .",

    "1 ) a geometrically thick , very luminous disk forms with a luminosity @xmath146 , which effectively drives a fast compton - thick wind with velocities up to @xmath80.20.3c .",
    "it is important to note that the models of ohsuga et al .",
    "( 2009 ) include both radiation and magnetic forces which , depending on the state of the system , can generate both relativistic jets and disk winds .",
    "moreover , king & pounds ( 2003 ) and king ( 2010 ) showed that black holes accreting with modest eddington rates are likely to produce fast compton - thick winds .",
    "they considered only radiation - pressure and therefore fast winds can be effectively generated by low magnetized accretion disks as well . in particular , king ( 2010 ) derived that eddington winds from agn are likely to have velocities of @xmath80.1c and to be highly ionized , showing the presence of helium- or hydrogen - like iron .",
    "these properties strongly point toward an association of our detected ufos from the innermost regions of agn with eddington winds / outflows from the putative accretion disk .    depending on the estimated covering fraction ,",
    "the derived mass outflow rate of the ufos can be comparable to the accretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to the jet power .",
    "therefore , the ufos may have the possibility of bringing significant amount of mass and energy outward , potentially contributing to the expected feedback from the agn .",
    "in particular , king ( 2010 ) demonstrated that fast outflows driven by black holes in agn can explain important connections between the smbh and the host galaxy , such as the observed @xmath147@xmath148 relation ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "these ufos can potentially provide an even more important contribution to the expected feedback between the agn and the host galaxy than the jets in radio - loud sources .",
    "in fact , even if jets are highly energetic , they are also extremely collimated and carry a negligible mass .",
    "fast winds / outflows from the accretion disks , instead , are found to be massive and extend over wide angles .",
    "thus , we suggest that ufos in radio - loud agn are a new , important ingredient for feedback models involving these sources .",
    "using high signal - to - noise suzaku observations , we detected several absorption lines in the @xmath8710  kev band of three out of five blrgs with high statistical significance .",
    "if interpreted as blueshifted k - shell resonance absorption lines from fe xxv and fe xxvi , the lines imply the presence of outflowing gas from the central regions of blrgs with mildly relativistic velocities , in the range @xmath10.040.15c .",
    "the inferred ionization states and column densities of the absorbers are in the range log@xmath2@xmath845.6  erg  s@xmath3  cm and @xmath4@xmath8@xmath5@xmath6  @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this is the first time that evidence for ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ) from the central regions of radio - loud agn is obtained at x - rays .",
    "the estimated location of these ufos at distances within @xmath80.010.3  pc from the central super - massive black hole suggests that the outflows might be connected with agn accretion disk winds / ejecta ( e.g. , king & pounds 2003 ; proga & kallman 2004 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2009 ; king 2010 ) .",
    "depending on the covering fraction estimate ( here , @xmath139@xmath80.6 ) , their mass outflow rate can be comparable to the accretion rate and their kinetic power may correspond to a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity and be comparable to the jet power . these ufos would thus bring outward significant amounts of mass and energy , potentially contributing to the expected feedback from the agn on the surrounding environment .",
    "these results are in analogy with the recent findings of blue - shifted fe k absorption lines at @xmath8710  kev in the x - ray spectra of several radio - quiet agn , which demonstrated the presence of ufos in the central regions of these sources ( e.g. , apm  08279@xmath275255 , chartas et al .",

    "in particular , it is important to note that the physical parameters of ufos in radio - loud agn previously discussed are completely consistent with those reported in radio - quiet agn .",
    "this strongly suggests that we could actually be witnessing the same physical phenomenon in the two classes of objects and this can help us improve the understanding of the relation between the disk and the formation of winds / jets in black hole accretion systems .",
    "several questions remain open .",
    "it is important to note that the estimate of the covering factor @xmath141 in   5.2 might actually be only a lower limit .",
    "fast outflows are expected to come from regions close to the central black hole and to be highly ionized .",
    "thus , a slight increase in the ionization level of the absorbers would cause iron to be completely ionized and the gas to become invisible also in the fe k band .",
    "therefore , it is also quite possible that most , _ if not all _ , radio - loud agn contain ultra - fast outflows which can not be seen at present simply because they are highly ionized .    the physical properties of ufos in blrgs are also of great interest to understand the dynamics of accretion / ejection and the disk - jet connection . in particular , by studying the source variability , which , in some sources , is expected to occur on timescales as short as a few days , we can investigate the gas densities and internal dynamics of the outflow , as well as better constrain its distance from the smbh .",
    "this can help us understand in detail whether the ufos in radio - loud agn are similar to those in radio - quiet ones , or if major quantitative differences exist which affect jet formation and thus the radio - loud / radio - quiet agn division .",
    "finally , a substantial improvement is expected from the higher effective area and supreme energy resolution ( down to @xmath825  ev ) in the fe k band offered by the calorimeters on board the future astro - h and ixo missions . in particular , the lines will be resolved and also their profiles could be measured . the parameters of ufos will be determined with unprecedented accuracy and their dynamics could , potentially , also be studied through time - resolved spectroscopy on short time - scales ( e.g. , tombesi et al .",

    "the values have been derived by independently fitting the xis  0 , xis  2 ( when available ) , xis  3 and xis - bi spectra .",
    "the lower s / n of the separate xis spectra does not allow to clearly detect the absorption lines in each spectrum . however , the parameters are always consistent with those reported in table  3 . moreover , it is worth mentioning that in 3c  111 the blue - shifted fe k absorption lines are detected independently in both of the xis - fi ccds ( i.e. xis 0 and 3 ) , as shown in table  5 .",
    "this demonstrates that the line parameters derived from the different instruments are indeed consistent one with each other and assures the absence of any systematics induced by the combination of the xis - fi spectra .",
    "the search for narrow absorption lines in the @xmath8710  kev energy band could be complicated by the presence of ionized fe k edges at energies in the range from e@xmath17.1  kev to e@xmath19.3  kev , depending on the ionization state of iron ( from neutral to h - like ) .",
    "hence , one could object that some of the spectral structures we identified as blue - shifted absorption lines could actually be interpreted equally as well by ionized fe k edges . as a sanity check",
    ", we tested that the alternative modelling of the gaussian absorption lines with simple sharp absorption edges ( _ zedge _ in xspec ) did not significantly improve the spectral fits , as expected from the narrowness of the observed spectral features .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that the commonly held view of sharp fe k edges is an oversimplification of the real process and could lead to misleading results .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that if the adequate treatment of the decay pathways of resonances converging to the k threshold is properly taken into account , the resulting edges are not sharp but smeared and broadened ( e.g. , palmeri et al .",
    "2002 ; kallman et al .",
    "this effect can be negligible for neutral or extremely ionized iron ( he / h - like ) but is quite relevant for intermediate states ( with energies in the range e@xmath17.29  kev ) .",
    "intense fe k resonance absorption lines from different ionization states would be expected to accompany the edges . moreover ,",
    "a proper characterization of the possible fe k edges has already been taken into account when modeling the absorption features with the photo - ionization code xstar .    finally , it is worth noting that even if the cosmic abundance of nickel is negligible with respect to that of iron ( @xmath85% , from grevesse et al .",
    "1996 ) , the k - shell transitions of this element are distributed at energies greater than 7  kev and could , in principle , complicate our line identification . however , contamination by mildly ionized ni k@xmath19 lines is very unlikely , as it would require extremely high column densities ( @xmath4@xmath43@xmath11@xmath202  @xmath7 ) for these lines to be intense enough to be observable , which would consequently generate strong absorption lines and edges from all the other lighter elements as well",
    ".    the only possible contamination could be due to he / h - like ni , whose 1s2p transitions are at rest - frame energies of e@xmath17.8  kev and e@xmath18.1  kev , respectively . also in this case the column densities required to have lines with measurable intensities would be extremely high ( @xmath4@xmath43@xmath11@xmath202  @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , the very high ionization level required to have significant columns of these ions are so extreme ( log@xmath2@xmath766  erg  s@xmath3  cm ) that all the lighter elements would be completely ionized , with iron being the only possible exception , and therefore they will not contribute with other absorption features .",
    "we found that only the absorption line detected in 3c  390.3 at the energy of e@xmath18.11  kev could be associated with rest - frame absorption from h - like ni ( see table  3 ) .",
    "if this unlikely identification is correct , it would indicate the presence of an extremely compton - thick , extremely ionized and static absorber in the central regions of this blrg .",
    "however , we state that the consistency of the line energy with h - like ni is most probably only a mere coincidence .",
    "this is strengthened by the fact that none of the other lines detected at e@xmath437  kev have energies consistent with those from highly ionized nickel .",
    "the same conclusion has been reached also by tombesi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who performed a systematic search for blue - shifted fe k absorption lines in a large sample of radio - quiet agn observed with xmm - newton .",
