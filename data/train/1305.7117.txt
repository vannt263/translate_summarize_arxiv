    "the problem of synchronization of dynamical systems witnessed a surge of interest in the last few years , primarily for finite dimensional systems @xcite .",

    "one component of the proposed linear controllers is responsible for the control objective , assumed here to be regulation .",
    "the other component , which is used for enforcing synchronization , includes the weighted pairwise state differences . when penalizing the disagreement of the networked states , one chooses the weights in proportion to their disagreement .",
