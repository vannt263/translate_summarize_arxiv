    "the physical and orbital properties of the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) are believed to provide valuable information about the formation of the solar system . to date , directly observed kbos include objects with diameters ranging from @xmath525 km ( eg .",
    "1999 da@xmath7 , @xcite ; and 2003 bh@xmath8 , @xcite ) to 2400 km ( eg . eris , * ? ? ?",
    "kbos with diameters below a few tens of kilometers are beyond the detection of current ground and space - based telescopes .",
    "the kbo size distribution is the outcome of accretion and collisional evolution in the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function ( clf ) of the kbos provides an indirect means of determining their size distribution , and is observed to have the form : .",
    "the kbo size distribution is then a power - law of the form : , with slope @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is related to @xmath11 via : @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "current observations indicate @xmath13 @xcite , or equivalently , @xmath14 .",
    "hst observations by @xcite suggest a lower clf slope for @xmath15 .",
    "current theoretical models of the accretion and fragmentation processes in the early solar system suggest that @xmath10 remains constant only for larger objects , and that the slope of the size distribution changes at the ` break radius ' , @xmath16100 km @xcite .",
    "objects smaller than the break radius would be in collisional equilibrium and their size distribution would have the so - called dohnanyi equilibrium slope of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "object densities and bulk - moduli can influence the slope for the small objects , and the position of the break - radius @xcite .",
    "the deepest direct observations to date @xcite were performed with hst and reached a limiting magnitude of r=28.5 ( corresponding to an object diameter of @xmath520 km for an albedo of 0.04 at 40au ) .",
    "the number of observed objects was @xmath525@xmath18 lower than the extrapolation of the current clf slope .",
    "this absence of faint objects indicates a decrease in the density of the kuiper belt beyond 50 au ; and a dearth of sub-100 km kbos , in general .",
    "direct observation is not a feasible option for pursuing the much fainter km - sized kbos .",
    "some indirect methods of inferring the slope in the range of the km - sized objects have been explored .",
    "@xcite used voyager 2 images of neptune s moon triton to analyze cratering and infer a slope of @xmath19 for the size distribution of the km - sized impactors . @xcite",
    "have placed upper limits on small object densities by examining the optical and fir sky surface brightnesses of the ecliptic .",
    "they found that a straight extrapolation of the clf to r@xmath2040 - 50 mag would yield an ecliptic surface brightness higher than that observed",
    ".    one promising method of indirect detection for the smaller kbos is that of serendipitous stellar occultations @xcite . a km - sized kbo passing through the line of sight to a star will partially obscure the light from that star to reveal the presence of the otherwise invisible object",
    "such an occultation can not be predicted and the practice relies upon serendipity .",
    "a 1 km diameter kbo at 40au subtends and angle of only 34 @xmath21as , and the lightcurve resulting from an occultation by such an object is expected to exhibit a series of increases and decreases due to diffraction @xcite ( henceforth r87 ) . at opposition , the orbital velocities of the earth ( 30 @xmath22  ) and a typical kbo at 40 au ( @xmath54 @xmath22  ) produce a retrograde relative velocity of @xmath2326 @xmath22  for the occulter , and the characteristic diffraction shadow cast by a 1 km kbo will pass over a terrestrial observer in a fraction of a second .",
    "observations must be performed at @xmath2440 hz to sample the flux oscillation in an observed lightcurve .",
    "we have performed a kbo occultation search with the 1.8 m plaskett telescope at the dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) using a 40hz camera .",
    "models of occultation lightcurves are presented in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "observation details are given in section  [ sec : observations ] , with data reduction and analysis methods described in sections  [ sec : reduction ] , and  [ sec : detection ] , respectively .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , and reported kbo occultation detections are evaluated in section  [ sec : critique ] .",
    "a surface density upper limit is presented in section  [ sec : upperlimit ] , with a discussion and summary provided in sections  [ sec : discussion ] and  [ sec : summary ] , respectively .",
    "the object diameter at which diffraction effects begin to dominate a kbo occultation lightcurve is known as the fresnel scale , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the wavelength and @xmath27 is the distance between the observer and the occulting body . for a kbo occultation ( @xmath27=40au ) observed in visible light ( 550 nm ) , the fresnel scale is 1285 m .",
    "fresnel - kirchhoff diffraction theory should be used to model occultation lightcurves for objects with sizes of order 1 fresnel scale unit ( fsu ) .",
    "following r87 , we have modeled occulters as circular disks , with the masking disk assembled by placing progressively smaller rectangular masks at the periphery of the structure .",
    "five ` orders ' of such rectangles were used for our models .",
    "an analytic circularly - symmetric solution to the fresnel - kirchhoff equation exists ( r87 ) , but we chose to develop our kbo disks from assemblies of rectangles to build in flexibility of object shape for future work .",
    "intensities were numerically integrated over a range of wavelengths to model a broadband observation of an occultation .",
    "this was accomplished by averaging evenly - weighted diffraction patterns at wavelengths distributed uniformly across the passband .",
    "lightcurves for 550 nm monochromatic light and 400 - 700 nm broadband light are compared in figure  [ fig : monovsvisible ] .",
    "the extended ` ringing ' present in the monochromatic pattern is attenuated by interference in the broadband pattern ; only the first peak away from the pattern center is well preserved .",
    "it was unnecessary to weight the intensities to match the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the target star , the spectral throughput of the telescope , and the spectral sensitivity of the ccd .",
    "even - weighting offered greater precision than needed for work with photometric time series having @xmath28% rms variability .",
    "the target stars were modeled by averaging evenly - spaced point sources over the projected stellar disks .",
    "a point source density of 100 fsu@xmath3 was used ( @xmath5100 points for the stellar disks of the m35 targets projected at 40 au ) .",
    "this density was more than sufficient to provide an accurate model of the shadow , consistent with models found in @xcite .",
    "intensities for the diffraction - dominated occultation shadows were computed as a function of position with respect to the center of the projected shadow .",
    "the relative velocity was used to convert positional coordinates to time coordinates to determine the corresponding lightcurve that would be recorded by an observer passing through such a shadow .",
    "an object observed at a given ecliptic latitude must have an orbital inclination equal to , or greater than , that latitude .",
    "as the fraction of tnos is observed to decrease with increasing orbital inclination @xcite ; an observed object is most probably very near its highest latitude , where its velocity vector lies nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane . as only the ecliptic latitude of observation",
    "is known , the orbital inclination was taken to be _ equal _ to the ecliptic latitude .",
    "this is the most probable configuration , and it is illustrated in figure  [ fig : velocitygeo3d ] .",
    "the relevant velocity is the component of the relative velocity projected onto the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "letting @xmath29 represent the angle between the line - of - sight , @xmath30 , and the relative velocity vector , @xmath31 , that component is .",
    "calculation of @xmath29 can be performed with the dot product @xmath32 :    @xmath33    the vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 were expressed in cartesian coordinates in terms of the quantities displayed in figure  [ fig : velocitygeo3d ] .",
    "the quantities : @xmath36 ( heliocentric distance to the kbo projected onto the ecliptic place ) ; angles @xmath37 , and @xmath11 ; and @xmath38 ( observer - to - kbo distance projected onto the ecliptic ) were determined .",

    "if @xmath42 is less than @xmath43 , the algorithm will fail for certain elongations as they no longer exist . for example , an object on an orbit with @xmath44 can not be observed at opposition ; its projected position is in the same hemisphere as the sun .",
    "the open clusters : m35 ( @xmath0 n ) , and m34 ( @xmath1 n ) were chosen as our primary target field , and our off - ecliptic control field , respectively .",

    "as the high - speed camera was installed in place of the guider , guiding was unavailable during the observations . without guiding , the plaskett telescope s tracking motor",
    "introduced an oscillation in right ascension with an amplitude of @xmath52 arcsec , and a period of @xmath534 minutes .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum drift speed across the chip of @xmath540.2 arcsec s@xmath51 , or 0.08 pixels s@xmath51 .",
    "the target star s motion between pixels was too small to induce a calibration error on the sub - second time scale of a kbo occultation .",
    "photometry was performed with sextractor v2.3 @xcite .",

    "but the c06 result indicates a surface density @xmath104 times greater than that estimated by extrapolation of the clf reported by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray occultation candidates reported by c07 were compared to model events ( see figure  [ fig : xraymodel ] ) .",
    "the sco x-1 x - ray source was modeled with @xmath26=0.2 - 0.6 nm light ( 6 - 2 kev , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , produced by a circular disk with a diameter of 3 m projected at 43 au ( c06 ) .",
    "occultation shadows were made for 25 m , 50 m , 75 m , and 100 m kbos at 43 au .",
    "the x - ray ( @xmath26=0.4 nm ) fresnel scale at 43",

    "the 25 m and 50 m models are of order @xmath1051 fsu and will produce circularly - symmetric diffraction shadows , regardless of the projected shape of the occulter .",
    "the 75 m and 100 m models correspond to 2 , and 3 fsu .",
    "real ( irregularly shaped ) objects this large would produce a more complex pattern of fringes , but the overall width ( duration ) and depth of the lightcurves would be comparable to those modeled here with a circular mask ( the symmetry of the shadows , as it relates to the size of the occulter , is further discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "a relative velocity of 25@xmath106 ( consistent with a keplerian orbit at 43 au ) was used .",
    "the 12 reported events range in duration from 1.5ms to 2.0ms ( 3 or 4 low flux measurements ) , and exhibit sharp transitions when dropping from the baseline intensity and when returning to it .",
    "sections through each of our modeled shadows were taken at an impact parameter that maximized the depth - to - width ratio of the diffraction shadow ( b=40 m ) .",
    "non - zero impact parameters also avoided the flux increase associated with the central flash which was not observed in any of the c07 events .",
    "lightcurves for the 100 m and 75 m diameter tnos are too broad ( long in duration ) to be consistent with the observed events , and the 25 m object produces intensity changes which are too shallow",
    ". the 50 m object s model lightcurve comes closest to reproducing the the observed flux changes .",
    "however , events with only 3 or 4 low flux measurements are too narrow to be consistent with occultations by kbos ( c07 event numbers 4 , 5 , 14 , 19 , 52 , 59 , 61 , 66 , 74 , 90 , and 104 ) , particularly in cases where 3 flux measurements are below @xmath540% of the original intensity ( c07 events 4 , 5 , 52 , and 66 ) .",
    "the abrupt decrease in flux observed in the remaining event ( event 41 ) and many others make them unconvincing when compared to the model lightcurves .",
    "the absence of the central flash in _ all _ events is statistically unusual . for objects of the purported size",
    ", the center of the shadow should display some rise in brightness , regardless of any irregularities in the shape of the occulter .    as dozens of similar events were found to be instrument artifacts , acceptance of these detections as tno occultations appears premature .",
    "@xcite ( henceforth r06 ) reported 3 tno occultation events found in 604 minutes of 45 hz imaging ( simultaneous observations with sloan g@xmath107 and i@xmath107 filters ) .",
    "the reported objects had radii and distances of : 110 m at 15au , 300 m at 210au , and 320 m at 140au , and would be beyond the detectable limits of our observations .",
    "there is no disagreement with our null result .",
    "the sizes of the occulters present a serious inconsistency when compared to the c06 result . with @xmath510 hours of data , sensitive to objects with impact parameters we estimate would be comparable to our own ( @xmath1081500 m , due to diffraction ) ,",
    "r06 found two @xmath5600 m objects .",
    "the @xmath589 hours of x - ray data from c07 would be sensitive to 600 m objects with impact parameters of @xmath108300 m ( no x - ray diffraction effects for an object this large ) , and would be expected to yield @xmath109 = 1.8@xmath18 as many 600 m objects  @xmath54 .",
    "c07 reported no flux drop - outs consistent with objects this large .",
    "though we found the x - ray flux drop - outs to be unconvincing as occultations by 50 m tnos , events produced by 600 m tnos ( had they been present ) are unlikely to have been overlooked by c06/c07 .",
    "consider that at 140 - 210 au , the x - ray ( @xmath26=0.4 nm ) fresnel scale is 65 - 79 m - much smaller than the purported objects .",

    "even an off - center chord through such a shadow would have produced an obvious occultation which would easily have been identified by the authors .",
    "the absence of any corroborating 600 m tnos in the x - ray time series is a serious inconsistency between r06 and c07 .",
    "r06 use a ` variability index ' ( vi ) for their detection algorithm .",
    "the standard deviation was computed in 0.08 - 0.40s intervals through the time series ( each denoted ` sig(int ) ' ) , and normalized by the number of standard deviations ( stddev(sig ) ) from the overall mean standard deviation ( meansig ) ; thus : .",
    "localized increases above vi=4.5 were interpreted as being due to the brightness fluctuations associated with occultation candidates .",
    "three events were identified with vi=5.3 , 5.6 , and 7.2 .",
    "these are the moduli of the vector ( vi@xmath110 , vi@xmath111 ) , but as the vi@xmath111 values are small time series .",
    "this is expected as a result of the wavelength dependence of diffraction . ] , the modulus of the vector is well approximated by the vi@xmath110 value .",
    "the vi values were interpreted as ( vi)-sigma results , but the underlying distribution of standard deviations ( sig(int ) values ) used to compute the vi values is non - gaussian ; it is positively skewed .    to determine the vi values expected in the data , a 10 hour ( 45 hz ) time series with 1.5% 1/f noise",
    "was artificially generated ( guaranteed to contain no occultations ) .",
    "the vi was computed with intervals of 0.08s , 0.20s , and 0.40 , consistent with those described in r06 . for each interval",
    ", the distribution of values larger than vi=4.5 ( the r06 threshold ) are shown in figure  [ fig : vihist ] . the number of vi@xmath684.5 values is higher than expected for gaussian variates .",
    "values as high as those observed by r06 are expected with this method .",
    "values as high as vi=7.2 were not observed , but a temporary increase in the noise level of a time series could easily produce such a measurement .    in this evaluation ,",
    "several tens of points were found with vi@xmath684.5 .",
    "this behavior is not reported by r06 . however , the method produces a positively skewed distribution of variates which can be seen r06 figure 1 .",
    "the best that can be stated at this time is that the statistical significance of the points is lower than would be the case for gaussian variates , but is otherwise unclear .",
    "the slope of the size - distribution for the sub - km objects is estimated to be q@xmath1123.5 .",
    "a variety of independent methods have been used , including : numerical simulations of the collisional evolution @xcite , observations of cratering on triton @xcite , and inferences based on the absence of optical and infrared light produced by such a population @xcite .",
    "although we are skeptical of the reported sub - km tno occultations for the reasons stated in section  [ sec : critique ] , neither c06 , nor r06 , nor this work have reported any occultation by a tno larger than 1 km . at this limiting size , an upper limit more stringent than our own can be placed on the current sky surface density of tnos .",
    "equation  [ eq : densitylimit ] was recalculated with the @xmath98 products for each data set summed .",
    "velocity and impact parameter values of ( @xmath113,@xmath114 km ) and ( @xmath115,@xmath116 m ) were used for the r06 and c06 data set , respectively .",
    "the velocities are the average relative velocities for kbos during the observation periods .",
    "the impact parameter for r06 ( b=1.5 km ) was chosen to accommodate diffraction effects .",
    "such effects would be negligible for an x - ray occultation by a 1 km object .",
    "thus , the sum of @xmath98 over each target is , yielding an overall 95% confidence limit on the surface density of 1 km ( diameter ) kbos at 40 au of = .",
    "this limit is shown in figure  [ fig : clftotal ] .",
    "non - spherical objects originating in the outer solar system ( eg .",
    "peanut - shaped comets ) suggest that the spherical symmetry assumed in our lightcurve models is not to be expected for tnos",
    ". however , diffraction shadows cast by objects with r@xmath1170.5 fsu are circularly symmetric , regardless of the shape of the occulter .",
    "occultation shadows for different - sized elliptical tnos ( @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the ratio of the semi - major and semi - minor axes ) were generated to illustrate this ( see figure  [ fig : symmetry ] ) .",
    "the circular symmetry of the shadows is preserved for @xmath1200.5 fsu ( @xmath5650 m for visible light at 40 au ) , despite the asymmetry of the occulting masks .",
    "the shadow profiles for objects larger than this do not require cross - correlation to detect ; they would have been identifiable by visual inspection of the time series , had any been present .    plant and recover tests were performed with profiles for 500 elliptical objects having uniformly distributed random parameters of : 200m@xmath1211000 m , 0m@xmath64impact - parameter@xmath644000 m , 1.0@xmath1223.0 , and @xmath123 ; where @xmath124 , @xmath94 , and @xmath29 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the object , and @xmath29 is the position angle of the rotated object .",
    "r@xmath80 was taken to be @xmath125 in order to compare the results to figure  [ fig : recovered_kbos ] .",
    "the observed detection limits did not change and are shown in figure  [ fig : ellip_recovery ] . thus , cross - correlation detection kernels based on circularly - symmetric occulting masks successfully detect occultations by sub - fresnel - scale irregularly - shaped kbos .",
    "our method of generating artificial time series did not incorporate the effects of variable noise levels in a time series .",
    "although many of our recovery tests were performed with constant - noise artificial time series , they were verified in our final detection run by planting artificial occultation events in the real data .",
    "the results were found to be consistent with simulations we performed with the artificial data , and we believe that the presented estimates for the limiting detectable kbo size , @xmath84 , and the maximum impact parameter , @xmath85 , are accurate .",
    "the presence of a period of increased noise within a time series alters the statistical properties of the variates .",
    "the overall _ measured _ standard deviation of the variates will lie between those measured for the low - noise and high - noise segments , which will lead to increases in the rates of false negatives and false positives in the respective segments .",
    "our time series were broken into segments having approximately constant noise levels to mitigate this problem .",
    "analysis of our 5.0 star - hours of photometric time series on two b9v stars in the ecliptic open cluster , m35 , revealed no viable candidate occultations .",
    "for the first time , the recovery of artificial occultation lightcurves was used to determine the limiting detectable object size and impact parameter for a kbo occultation .",
    "we place an upper limit on the surface density of kbos of = ( m@xmath12635.3 corresponds to a @xmath5860 m ( diameter ) object with a geometric albedo of 0.04 ) .",
    "having evaluated positive detections of tno occultation events @xcite , we believe that the published events are likely to be spurious and that no serendipitous stellar occultation by a tno has yet been reported .",
    "comparison of the expected lightcurve structure for the c07 events with the observed structures show that the decreases in flux are too brief to be consistent with occultations by small bodies at 40 au ; and evaluation of the variability index , vi , used by r06 revealed that the _ vi variates _ are not normally distributed , but are drawn from a positively skewed distribution , prone to yielding high values . also , the two @xmath5600 m ( diameter ) tnos discovered in 10 star - hours of r06 data suggest @xmath54 such events should be present in the 89 star - hour x - ray time series observed at a similar ecliptic latitude ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) .",
