    "when constructing symplectic manifolds it is natural to wonder whether topological techniques using handles can be made to work symplectically .",

    "conditions are imposed on the attaching spheres in relation to the contact structure @xmath14 on @xmath4 and in particular , in dimension four , @xmath0-handles must be attached along _ legendrian _ knots ( knots tangent to @xmath14 ) . in this paper",
