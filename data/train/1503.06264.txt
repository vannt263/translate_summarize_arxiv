    "the radio access networks ( rans ) are facing great challenges in the mobile internet era . on one hand ,",
    "next - generation rans are expected to support 1000 times increased data traffic  @xcite with limited spectrum and energy .",
    "therefore , both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency should be vastly improved . on the other hand , emerging applications and services put forward increasingly diverse requirements for connections in terms of capacity , latency , and reliability .",
    "hence , next - generation rans need to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate evolving applications .    to tackle these challenges , software - defined networking ( sdn )",
    "have been proposed to renovate rans .",
    "softran  @xcite introduced a logically centralized big base station ( bs ) to globally optimize the ran resources so that the network efficiency can be improved .",
    "the control - data separation concept of sdn was extended to decouple the control and data coverages at the air interface in rans  @xcite . with the decoupled air interface ,",
    "bs sleeping control can be effectively employed to reduce energy waste by adapting to real traffic dynamics and improve the network energy efficiency without generating coverage holes .",
    "moreover , concert  @xcite proposed to deploy rans as software - defined services , which can dramatically improve the flexibility of bs operations .",
    "however , these studies focus on the architecture design only , and leave the protocol design as an open research issue .    besides design",
    ", it is of much research interest to evaluate the sdn concepts in practical ran implementations .",
    "our previous work presented a prototype system which demonstrated the feasibility of decoupled air interface on top of the gsm standard  @xcite .",
    "but only a single type of service ( namely voice calls ) was investigated , and no attempt to realize dynamic bs operations was made .",
    "pran  @xcite showed a preliminary implementation of dynamic resource allocation of bss with centralized ran schedulers .",
    "however , other bs operations such as bs sleeping were not studied .",
    "to our knowledge , there are few efforts to evaluate the protocols of bs operations in software - defined rans ( sdrans ) with practical implementations .    in this paper , we present the protocol design and evaluation of our sdran framework named hyper - cellular networks ( hycell ) .",
    "hycell enables globally resource - optimized and energy - efficient ( green  @xcite ) bs operations by exploiting the decoupled air interface , centralized bs control , and software - defined bs functions . to design the decoupled air interface ,",
    "we take an evolutionary approach and propose our separation scheme for current 3gpp standards , which is beneficial for network migration .",
    "based on that , we design our bs dispatching protocol , which determines and assigns the globally optimal bs to serve the user requests , as well as our bs sleeping protocol",
    ". moreover , we prototype a hycell testbed on a software - defined radio ( sdr ) platform , and use it to evaluate our design .",
    "the main contributions of our work are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we propose a separation scheme to realize the decoupled air interface for existing 3gpp standards from the aspects of both network functionalities and logical channels , and demonstrate its feasibility in the testbed .",
    "we design a bs dispatching protocol for global optimization of network resources , and implement a bs dispatching scheme to effectively achieve load balancing among multiple bss .",
    "we design a bs sleeping protocol to improve the network energy efficiency , and present an implementation with a threshold - based algorithm , which shows about 60% energy saving gain in our testbed .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give an overview of the hycell architecture as well as the challenges and solutions to realize it in section  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "then we present the design of the separation scheme , bs dispatching , and bs sleeping in section  [ sec : design ] .",
    "evaluation of the testbed implementation is given in section  [ sec : eval ] .",
    "section  [ sec : con ] concludes the paper .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : arch ] , hycell decouples the air interface of the ran by separating the control coverage from the traffic coverage with two types of bss .",
    "control bss ( cbss ) provide the control coverage , while traffic bss ( tbss ) provide the traffic coverage .",
    "typically cbss have large coverage areas , within which multiple traffic bss ( tbss ) are deployed .",
    "cbss provide the network control to underlying tbss and mobile users . in particular , they grant the network access to mobile users . to guarantee a basic level of data service and to cope with high mobility users , cbss can also be used to provide low - rate data services such as voice call service to the ue . unlike cbss , tbss are only responsible for high - rate data services . specifically , there can be different subtypes of tbss to support different classes of high - rate data services . through the separation , cbss and tbss can be more simplified than conventional bss .    under the separation architecture , cbss provide centralized control , and enable dynamic operations of tbss .",
    "cbss and tbss serve mobile users collaboratively .",
    "when the user equipment ( ue ) is powered on , it searches for nearby cbss and registers to the network through a cbs .",
    "cbss gather network state information such as ue locations and traffic load from the mobile users and tbss underlying its coverage , and thus hold a global view of the network .",
    "when high - rate data services are required , the ue sends requests to the cbs and the cbs dispatches one or more tbss for the high - rate data transmission afterwards . when the network traffic load is light , tbss can be turned off under the command of the cbs to reduce the energy consumption of the network while the cbs preserves the network coverage .",
    "moreover , hycell decouples the software which realizes the bs functions from the hardware which converts signals between baseband and radio frequency . in this way ,",
    "bs functions are software defined by high - level programming languages , and it is much easier to update the bss to handle new mobile internet applications and services .",
    "further , with the help of virtualization , bss can become virtual instances in cloud data centers .",
    "network efficiency can be improved with resource pooling , and bs operations can be more flexible with the help of virtual machine migration .    with the decoupled air interface , centralized bs control , and software - defined bs functions , hycell enables green bs operations in sdrans .",
    "it leads to a promising path towards next - generation rans .",
    "we summarize the challenges of protocol design in hycell and our proposed solutions as follows .",
    "[ [ separation - of - air - interface ] ] separation of air interface + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper , we target at current air interface protocols and propose our separation scheme to design a decoupled air interface . however , it is a daunting task to analyze the air interface in existing 3gpp standards .",
    "the physical layer signals are difficult to categorize and the interactions among them are complicated , making it difficult to separate the control coverage from the traffic coverage . to tackle this challenge , we propose our separate scheme from the aspects of network functionalities and logical channels , rather than physical layer signals . in our design ,",
    "we jointly consider the two levels and ensure that the expected network functionalities of cbss and tbss can be mapped to their corresponding logical channels .",
    "this guides us to an effective separation scheme of the air interface .",
    "[ [ cbs - tbs - protocol - design ] ] cbs - tbs protocol design + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the cbs - tbs protocols do not exist in current 3gpp standards .",
    "however , the protocols are crucial for the sdrans to optimize the network performance . specifically , we need a protocol to find the best tbss and assign them to serve the ue .",
    "we also need a protocol to dynamically switch off tbss to reduce energy waste and improve network energy efficiency .",
    "the signaling interactions in the protocols must carry sufficient network state information for global optimization . at the same time",
    ", it should ensure realtime decision and accommodate potential updates . to meet the requirements ,",
    "we choose simple but effective metrics of the network state information in message exchange .",
    "we also make our protocols extensible by adopting modular design .",
    "[ [ ue - transparency ] ] ue transparency + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when designing hycell , we would like to guarantee that the updates at the bs side are transparent to the ue side . with ue transparency",
    ", the existing mobile terminals can work with hycell automatically .",
    "it brings the benefit of compatibility , which is appealing during the protocol evolution and network upgrade .",
    "however , it also limits the degree of freedom we have to realize the sdran . to achieve ue transparency , we carefully design the separation scheme of the air interface and make sure that the ue - facing interfaces are preserved .",
    "in addition , we exploit the backhaul connection for cbs - tbs communication and cooperation , which optimizes the network without the need of adding functions to mobile terminals .",
    "in this section we describe our key design aspects .",
    "first we analyze the air interface of 3gpp standards and propose a separation scheme for hycell",
    ". then a bs dispatching protocol design is proposed , and we also present a bs sleeping protocol which achieves great energy saving gain without sacrificing mobile users quality of service .",
    ".logical channel separation of 3gpp standards . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to show the energy saving performance of bs sleeping , we currently take a component analysis approach due to the lack of power measurement equipment .",
    "based on the specifications , we calculate the power consumption of pcs , usrps and the switch respectively and take the sum as the total power consumption of the testbed .",
    "table  [ tab : sav ] compares the power consumption of different sleep modes in the scenario when there are no active user requests . without bs sleeping ( no sleep in the table ) , all bss are idle , and the total power consumption is .",
    "when we only turn off the usrps and software bss on pcs ( half sleep ) , the total power consumption is , that is , 16% power consumption can be saved .",
    "if we further power off the pcs ( full sleep ) , the total power can be reduced to , which translates to 60% energy savings .",
    "it is thus observed that bs sleeping can bring significant energy saving gain , of which the major part comes from the baseband power consumption .",
    "in this paper we present the design and evaluation of hycell .",
    "the proposed framework hycell exploits the decoupled air interface , centralized bs control , and software - defined bs functions to enable green bs operations in sdrans .",
    "we propose a separation scheme to realize the decoupled air interface , and further design the protocols of bs dispatching and bs sleeping .",
    "our testbed implementation validates the feasibility of the separation scheme for the gsm / gprs standard .",
    "further the test results show that bs dispatching can effectively achieve load - balancing , and bs sleeping can provide about 60% energy saving gain .",
