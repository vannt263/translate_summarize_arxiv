    "in a phenomenological study of heavy ion collisions and evolution of early universe , it is important to evaluate the energy density and the pressure of the quark - gluon plasma near the transition temperature of the deconfining phase transition of qcd .    on an anisotropic lattice with @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 the lattice spacings in spatial and temporal directions , the standard plaquette action for @xmath4 gauge theory is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spatial ( temporal ) plaquette .",
    "hence the energy density , @xmath7 , and the pressure , @xmath8 , are expressed in terms of the anisotropy coefficients , @xmath9 we choose @xmath3 and @xmath10 as independent variables to vary the lattice spacings .",
    "perturbative values for these anisotropy coefficients were calculated by karsch in @xcite . however , when we apply them to data obtained by mc simulations , we encounter pathological results such as a negative pressure and a non - vanishing pressure gap at the deconfining transition point of @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "non - perturbative anisotropy coefficients are , therefore , required to study @xmath11 and @xmath12 in mc simulations .",
    "two non - perturbative methods have been adopted to determine the anisotropy coefficients .",
    "one is `` the matching method '' @xcite based on a measurement of @xmath13 as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 by matching spatial and temporal wilson loops .",
    "the other is a method based on a non - perturbative estimate of pressure obtained by `` the integral method '' @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new non - perturbative approach to compute the anisotropy coefficients , and determine the coefficients for @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of isotropic lattices , @xmath16 , where most simulations are performed . in this case , two anisotropy coefficients are just the beta - function at @xmath17 ; @xmath18 , whose non - perturbative values are well studied both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a combination of the remaining two anisotropy coefficients is known to be again related to the beta - function by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "therefore , only one additional input is required to determine the anisotropy coefficients for isotropic lattices .",
    "our method is based on an observation that , the transition temperature @xmath20 is independent of the anisotropy of the lattice .",
    "this brings us the following relation between the anisotropy coefficients and the slope @xmath21 of the transition curve in the @xmath22 plane at @xmath23 , @xmath24 from this equation , we obtain the expressions for the customarily used forms for the anisotropy coefficients @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; @xmath28 therefore , when the value for the beta - function is available , we can determine these anisotropy coefficients by measuring @xmath21 from the finite temperature transition curve in the @xmath22 plane .    as a result , @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the plaquette at @xmath31 .    in order to determine the transition curve in the @xmath22 plane ,",
    "we compute the rotated polyakov loop @xmath32 .",
    "we define the transition point as the peak position of the susceptibility @xmath33 the coupling parameter dependence of @xmath34 in the @xmath35 plane is computed by applying the spectral density method @xcite extended to anisotropic lattices .",
    "this enables us to compute the anisotropy coefficients directly from simulations at @xmath36 without introducing an interpolation ansatz , unlike the case of previous studies .",
    "= 7.2 cm       we first test the method for the case of @xmath0 gauge theory at the transition point @xmath39 for @xmath40 and 5 .",
    "simulations are performed on @xmath41 and @xmath42 lattices .",
    "results for @xmath43 and @xmath44 are denoted by filled circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : kc ] ( top ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the results from the integral method ( doted curves ) @xcite .",
    "we then study the more realistic case of the @xmath1 gauge theory . because the method works well even with data obtained only on isotropic lattices",
    ", we analyze the high statistics data by the qcdpax collaboration @xcite .",
    "simulations were performed at the deconfining transition point for @xmath40 and 6 on five lattices .",
    "details of the @xmath1 simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : su3sus ] shows the @xmath35 dependence of the susceptibility on a @xmath45 lattice . because the peak of the susceptibility becomes sharper as the spatial volume of the lattice",
    "is increased , we can measure @xmath21 most precisely on the spatially largest lattices .",
    "therefore , in the following , we use the results obtained on the largest @xmath46 and @xmath47 lattices .",
    "the values obtained on smaller lattices are consistent . for the beta - function ,",
    "we adopt a result computed from a recent string tension data @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : kc ] ( bottom ) , we summarize our results for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the @xmath1 gauge theory ( filled circles ) together with previous values : the perturbative results ( dot - dashed lines ) @xcite , results from the integral method ( doted curves ) @xcite , and those from the matching of wilson loops on anisotropic lattices ( squares @xcite , triangles @xcite ) .",
    "we find that all non - perturbative methods give values which are roughly consistent with each other , showing a clear deviation from the perturbation theory .",
    "the deconfining transition is of first order for @xmath1 . at a first order transition point",
    ", we have a finite gap for energy density , the latent heat , but expect no gap for pressure .",
    "it is known that the perturbative anisotropy coefficients leads to a non - vanishing pressure gap at the deconfining transition point : @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath40 and 6 @xcite .",
    "new values for the gaps in @xmath11 and @xmath12 using our non - perturbative anisotropy coefficients are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we find that the problem of non - zero pressure gap is completely resolved with our non - perturbative anisotropy coefficients .",
    "we note that , because the beta - function appears only as a common overall factor in ( [ eq : e3p ] ) and ( [ eq : emp ] ) , the conclusion that @xmath52 vanishes with our anisotropy coefficients does not depend on the value of the beta - function .",
    "actually we have from eqs.([eq : e3p ] ) and ( [ eq : emp ] ) a simple condition for @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the gap in the spatial ( temporal ) plaquette between the two phases .",
    "although the two sides of ( [ eq : cnddp0 ] ) are obtained from quite different measurements , they agree precisely with each other as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
