    "a pulsar timing array ( pta ) is a collection of millisecond pulsars monitored frequently for imprints of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "currently there are three pta collaborations : the european pulsar timing array ( epta ) @xcite , the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) @xcite , and the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves ( nanograv ) @xcite . in partnership with each other",
    ", they make up the international pulsar timing array ( ipta ) @xcite . using a pta as an instrument for gw detection , these collaborations search for correlated disturbances in the pulse arrival times .",
    "@xcite estimate that detection of gws will happen in the next decade , with uncertainties arising from unknowns such as the amplitude of the gw signal , the number of pulsars added to the array in the future , and the noise level of the pulsar themselves .",
    "the appraisal of pulsar noise is key in estimating the sensitivity of the experiment , and in this manuscript we employ a simple test to provide some knowledge of the noise behavior in the nanograv pulsars .",
    "we are concerned specifically with the root mean square ( rms ) residual as an estimator for the noise amplitude .",
    "we summarize briefly here the expected scaling of the sensitivity of the overall experiment with rms .",
    "@xcite calculates the average gw signal - to - noise ( gw s / n ) ratio for a pta that samples the pulsars at regular intervals , assuming each of these pulsars has the same uncorrelated noise level .",
    "they show that in the weak - signal limit ( where the uncorrelated noise dominates the gw signal ) , the gw s / n is inversely proportional to the square of the rms . in the intermediate regime ( where the uncorrelated noise is roughly equivalent with the gw signal ) , the gw s / n has a more complicated relationship to the rms , but the sensitivity to gws still increases with decreasing rms .",
    "finally , in the strong - signal limit ( where the gw signal dominates the noise ) , the gw s / n is determined by the cadence of the observations .",
    "reducing the rms residual is therefore a crucial pta strategy until we find ourselves in the strong - signal regime .",
    "although there are multiple avenues for noise ( and therefore rms ) reduction , this paper focuses on the possibility of decreasing the rms by increasing the _ dwell _ time , the amount of observation time spent on a pulsar to obtain a single arrival time .",
    "we roughly expect a pulsar s timing residuals to be gaussian distributed and , consequently , we expect the rms of the residuals to scale as the inverse square root of the dwell time .",
    "thus we commonly assume that we can improve the sensitivity of the experiment simply by increasing the dwell time @xcite .",
    "the presence of red noise changes the situation .",
    "there are many possible sources of the red noise : measurement noise , gws @xcite , intrinsic noise @xcite , objects orbiting the pulsar @xcite , or interstellar medium ( ism ) effects @xcite .",
    "red noise likely exists at some level in all pulsars , and it becomes more important as we reduce the white noise . when red noise begins to dominate the overall noise , we can no longer expect the rms to decrease with increasing dwell time @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the extent to which increasing the dwell time on nanograv pulsars will reduce the noise in the timing residuals . to test our ability to decrease the rms , we can not go back and increase the amount of dwell time for each pulsar in past observations , but we can mimic this by adding up adjacent observations to simulate longer dwell times . throughout the paper , we use",
    "`` n '' , the number of adjacent observations being added together , which is a surrogate to `` t '' , the dwell time .",
    "this allows us to discuss the `` root n '' behavior of the pulsars , which should be read analogous to `` root t '' .",
    "this is a common test done in pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we demonstrate the expectation of the root n dependence of the rms residual , highlighting the conditions that must be met . in  3 ,",
    "we describe how we applied this to the nanograv data and present the results . in  4 , we discuss whether the pulsars display this dependence and the limits to the test resulting from the timing model fit . in  5 , we summarize our findings , discuss our results in the context of epta and ppta data , and suggest how future work will help us understand the situation better ..",
    "a timing model for a pulsar is generated after a pulsar has been observed for a long period of time .",
    "it predicts when the next pulse from the pulsar should arrive @xcite .",
    "the timing model yields a timing residual , which is the measured pulse arrival time minus the predicted pulse arrival time : @xmath2 we typically use the rms of these residuals as a measure to characterize the total noise in the dataset .",
    "a lower rms residual is indicative of residuals that are close to zero . while many pulsars follow the trend @xmath3 , where n is the number of observations made , not all pulsars do .",
    "we need to determine which pulsars rms residual decreases with increasing n and which do not , so we can make informed choices about which pulsars should be included in the pta and for how long they should be observed .",
    "we want to determine the effect of increasing the dwell time on the rms of a pulsar . as a proxy",
    ", we make this comparison by averaging n successive points together .",
    "then , we study how the rms of the timing residuals changes as a function of n.    first , let us demonstrate the existence of the root n relation and the conditions under which we expect it to hold true .",
    "we average an original data set @xmath4 by every n points .",
    "this gives us a new data set , @xmath5 , where m is the number of points in the new , averaged dataset . if q is the total number of points in the original dataset , then q = m@xmath6n . to create @xmath7",
    "we first create sets of samples of @xmath4 of every @xmath8th number : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and so on .",
    "the new points are calculated using @xmath11 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , becomes : @xmath14 it follows trivially that :",
    "@xmath15    it is the relationship contained in equation [ eqn : rms ] that we investigate in this paper .",
    "this relationship has been studied by many other authors ( such as @xcite ) , whose results were similar to ours .",
    "note that the veracity of the relation depends upon the residuals being statistically independent .",
    "if this is not the case , e.g. in red noise , @xmath16 , and equation 2 is not valid .",
    "also , if the distribution is non - stationary , i.e. it is changing in time , then the relationship @xmath17 would be true , and we would not expect the rms of the pulsars to decline as @xmath18 .",
    "recent works by @xcite and references therein state that the nanograv data appears to display noise patterns that allow us to assume stationary statistics with this data set .    in pta",
    "data sets , each data point is assigned an uncertainty , @xmath19 , based on the s / n of the data taken .",
    "the uncertainty can vary due to a variety of conditions , such as scintillation from the ism . to account for this variation ,",
    "our averaging was performed by weighting the points with @xmath20 .",
    "we performed a simulated test to verify if residuals with unequal errors still follow the root n trend .",
    "we took the j1713 + 0747 dataset and replaced the data points with values drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the unequal uncertainties from the original dataset were kept .",
    "we performed the test on this dataset and found that the rms of the simulated data follows the expected root n relationship even with the unequal errors .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the residuals of the timing data set on the 17 pulsars presented by @xcite in order to determine whether the nanograv pulsars timing noise follows the root n relationship .",
    "currently the nanograv pulsars are allotted roughly equal observing time of 15 - 45 minutes within nanograv s total telescope time .",
    "the 17 pulsars that were examined in this paper were observed from 2005 to 2010 at either the arecibo observatory or the green bank telescope , in frequencies ranging from 330mhz to 2500mhz .",
    "the one exception is psr j1713 + 0747 , which was observed at both telescopes .",
    "we demonstrated in the previous section that we expect the rms residual to be proportional to @xmath18 for pulsars whose residuals display uncorrelated noise when calculating the rms of a residual data set @xmath21 .",
    "for our data set , n is the number of data points that are being averaged together .",
    "since each data point is roughly the same observation time , n is directly proportional to the total dwell time , e.g. if you average every two points together , the resulting point is the expected timing residual of that pulsar being observed for twice as long .",
    "as discussed in  2 , these data have unequal uncertainties so we weight them by @xmath20 to account for the fact that some observations are not as accurate as others , due to the observing conditions .    in the nanograv observing program that @xcite uses , data from an observing epoch are split into 4mhz sub - bands in order to study the frequency evolution of the profile in greater detail .",
    "as we are interested in the behavior over long time scales @xcite , we begin by averaging over these frequency sub - bands as follows :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the @xmath24th residual on day @xmath25 , with @xmath26 representing the toa error , resulting from the cross - correlation with a template ( see @xcite ) , and @xmath27 is the total number of residual points on this day .",
    "uncertainties are given by the standard deviation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the weighted mean of each data set @xcite .",
    "with the large number of points in a given epoch , typically @xmath3015 , we expect the fit to the average to follow a @xmath31 distribution with @xmath32 degrees of freedom , and we weight the uncertainties by the reduced @xmath31 .",
    "these calculations yield a reduced new data set , ( @xmath4 ) that depicts one timing residual ( @xmath33 ) and the standard deviation of the timing residual ( @xmath34 ) for each observing day @xmath25 .",
    "we use these reduced data sets to inspect how the rms residual changes if we observe each pulsar for longer periods of time , or in other words , as we increase n.    to begin , we calculate the weighted rms ( wrms ) of the epoch - averaged residuals , @xmath35 : @xmath36 the uncertainty in this residual wrms is given by : @xmath37 next , we average every n residual data points that are consecutive in time to make a new data set @xmath38 just as described above in equation 4 .",
    "the error for these points is found using error propagation and is similar to equation 5 .",
    "note that , unlike when we calculated the daily averaging , we do not weight the uncertainty by @xmath31 since the number of points is small and the @xmath31 distribution is not well behaved .",
    "we let n have the range @xmath39 where b is equal to the number of residuals in the original set divided by the number of points being averaged together .",
    "again , the residual wrms and @xmath40 are calculated using equations [ eqn : wrms ] and [ eqn : sigmarms ] .",
    "we examine the rate at which the wrms of the timing residuals for each of the nanograv pulsars decline with respect to n. the majority of the nanograv pulsars were observed in both a low - frequency ( generally 800 mhz ) and a high - frequency ( generally 1400 mhz ) band . the exceptions to this",
    "are psr j1713 + 0747 , which was observed in the high and low bands at both the arecibo observatory ( ao ) and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , and psrs b1953 + 29 , j1853 + 1308 and j1910 + 1256 , which were originally part of another project so we have only the 1410 mhz observations for most of the observation time @xcite .    to quantify the extent each pulsar follows the root n behavior , we find the least squares fit of the data to wrms = an@xmath1 , where a is the only fitted parameter . for each fit , a reduced @xmath31 was found using : @xmath41 where k@xmath42 is the number of degrees of freedom found with k@xmath43 .",

    "it represents a necessary , but not sufficient condition , of white noise in the pulsar data . in other words ,",

    "for example , there may be a red noise process intrinsic to the pulsar , but the redness that such a process imprints on the timing residuals may be removed by the timing model fit .",
    "since determining the best timing model fit was beyond the scope of this work , we assumed the current nanograv fitting procedure of @xcite .",
    "the residuals being analyzed have already passed through a timing model fit which has the property of ` whitening ' the data , especially in the flattening of low frequency power .",
    "thus the noise processes themselves could be red while the timing residuals pass the root n test .",
    "if a pulsar fails this test , then we can conclusively state its spectrum is not white .",
    "however , displaying an rms proporotional to root n does not necessarily mean the residuals themselves , nor the processes that created them , are true gaussian processes .    over - fitting is a concern for gw astronomy as it may eliminate a red noise signal from gws by subsuming it into a fit .",
    "indeed , this is a chief concern of @xcite as the expected stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb ) would be a red noise signal that may have significant power removed by an improper timing model fit , specifically in regards to fitting the time dependent nature of the dm .",
    "some recent analyses avoid this by fitting for the timing model parameters and gw signals simultaneously @xcite , while others search the post - fit residuals while accounting for the effect of the timing model fit on their signal @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to study how an individual gw source will be affected by the @xcite timing model fit we assume .",
    "however , we stress that even if this test does not conclusively describe the underlying noise in a pulsar , decreasing the post - fit residual noise will increase the sensitivity to a gw signal for any post - fit analysis and thus represents an important aim of optimization studies .",
    "we demonstrated that the residuals from 15 of the nanograv pulsars whose data we analyzed ( b1855 + 09 , b1953 + 29 , j0030 + 0451 , j0613@xmath440200 , j1012 + 5307 , j1455@xmath443330 , j1600@xmath443053 , j1713 + 0747 , j1744@xmath441134 , j1853 + 1308 , j1909@xmath443744 , j1910 + 1256 , j1918@xmath440642 , j2145@xmath440750 , and j2317 + 1439 ) are consistent with the root n trend , with a few caveats summarized here .",
    "one striking feature of these results is that most pulsars in figures 1,2 and 3 display a fit to root n that is better than the uncertainties would suggest , indicated by the reduced @xmath31 values being smaller than 1 . while it appears that most of the pulsars in nanograv have timing residuals that are consistent with the @xmath18 trend , we caution the reader about this conclusion .",
    "there is some evidence that this pulsars are being overfitted by their models , however , they still follow the root n trend .    psrs j2145@xmath440750 and j2317 + 1439 do not have a lot of data .",
    "if we accumulate more data points for these pulsars , it is expected that these pulsars will continue to be consistent with the trend of the rms being proportional to n@xmath1 . on the other hand , psr j1910 + 1256",
    "has a lot of data , but since it was observed in only one frequency band , it could not be fitted for dm .",
    "the reduced @xmath31 value for this pulsar is large and it is evident that dm fitting is necessary to get an accurate understanding of the data .",
    "there were only two pulsars that showed a deviation from the root n trend , namely j1640 + 2224 , j1643@xmath441224 .",
    "this is evident by their larger reduced @xmath31 values , and by their plots showing a shallower spectrum than the n@xmath1 fit .",
    "this could be an indication of a red noise component .",
    "this is a conclusion that was reached by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "psr b1937 + 21 is a known red pulsar ( figure [ fig : b1937 + 21 ] ) , so we include it to show how a truly red pulsar will behave in our scheme .",
    "the plot shows that there is no correlation between the rms residual and @xmath18 ; this is also evident from its reduced @xmath31 value .",
    "many possible sources causing the timing noise exhibited by this pulsar have been tested , but none have been confirmed as the source of red noise @xcite . in any case , results from this pulsar are reassuring in that a pulsar dominated by red noise is not consistent with the root n test .",
    "we wanted to determine whether increasing the dwell time on the nanograv pulsars will have the expected effect of reducing the rms residual in each pulsar .",
    "in all cases the nanograv pulsars follow the trend of @xmath3 steadily , at least until observed for eight times as long ( @xmath46 ) in each observing session . using this conclusion , we expect to be able to observe these 15 pulsars for up to 2 - 6 hours ( depending on the pulsar s current dwell time of 15 - 45 minutes ) in one observation , before we expect to see any inconsistency with rms @xmath47 n@xmath1 relation .",
    "indeed , this result has been shown for j1713 + 0747 in the recent , continuous 24 hour global campaign , where they observed a root t behavior @xcite .    our claim that root",
    "n is a surrogate for root t assumes that the noise properties of the pulsars are stationary in time , which are discussed in  2 .",
    "recent works by @xcite and references therein state that the nanograv data appears to display noise patterns that allow us to assume stationary statistics with this data set .",
    "if we can determine that the pulsar s timing residuals display noise that is consistent with the `` root t '' behavior , we can be confident that increasing the dwell time will yield lower noise in the timing residuals .",
    "this is critical input for decisions regarding future observations , specifically in determining how long to spend on each pulsar .",
    "the simplest way to decrease the noise in a pta is to integrate over the noise for longer periods of time in each observation , e.g. go from 30-minute integrations on each pulsar to 1-hour integrations on each pulsar .",
    "however , this only works if the pulsar s timing residuals display noise that is consistent with the root n trend .",
    "we have averaged multiple ( n ) adjacent integrations , a substitute to actually increasing dwell time , to see whether the timing residuals display a root n behavior .",
    "our analysis on the nanograv pulsars shows that 15 of 17 are in this root n regime , with some displaying this all the way to an increase in dwell time by a factor of 8 .",
    "we note though that we only examined nanograv data , and the results we obtained are not necessarily the results received if this test was run on epta or ppta data for these pulsars .",
    "we already see that just between the two telescopes in nanograv we can get different results ( psr j1713 + 0747 ) , which may be different due to different dm removal algorithms @xcite .",
    "improvements in our understanding will come from attention to the dispersion removal algorithms .",
    "we saw evidence that sometimes the current algorithm over - corrects the data .",
    "further work will consider longer data sets where red noise may be more prominent .",
    "there are many other ways to characterize the timing noise in pulsars @xcite , but this test is a good first test in determining the improvability of the timing noise of a pulsar and which pulsars should be included in a pta .",
    "characterizing the timing noise in this way is only one aspect of optimizing ptas .",
    "optimization must be done with respect to a particular goal ; so is the goal of the ptas to detect a stochastic background first @xcite , or a single source first @xcite , or is it to fully characterize the gw sources we detect ?",
    "how we delegate telescope time will depend upon the goal we choose in addition to the noise parameters .",
    "for example , if the background is in fact stochastic , we may choose different goals than if the background is dominated by a few bright sources @xcite . knowing which pulsars rms can be improved is an important first step in optimizing a pta .",
    "in general , a lower rms will produce more sensitive searches .",
    "the analysis done in this paper offers a measurement on the extent that the dwell time can be used to accomplish the goal of lowering the rms .",
    "we would like to thank ben stappers and gemma janssen for some very helpful discussions and the hospitality of jodrell bank centre for astrophysics while a.n.l .",
    "was on sabbatical .",
