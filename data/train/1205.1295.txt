    "this allowed us to focus on either the gga need for accuracy in choice of computational parameters and methods ( for example the need of a fixed amount of vacuum in the total system @xcite ) or the vdw - df need for accuracy in other parameters and methods ( for example the need for fixating the local electron density grid @xcite ) .",

    "the use of an intermediate reference energy subtracts not only intra - molecular contributions ( the alkane molecule is identical in the two calculations ) but also any direct alkane - alkane interaction across unit cell boundaries .",

    "the last set of calculations finds the energy gain @xmath62 of relaxing the isolated alkane molecule from the slightly deformed structure of the adsorbed state .",

    "the @xmath51 term of vdw - df depends slightly on the density grid points positions with respect to the molecule , and we therefore , as a matter of principle , choose to perform this part of the calculation using instead the gga variant pbe @xcite .",

    "the alkane molecules deform very little upon adsorption , compared to their gas phase structure . in the gas phase , calculated with vdw - df , we find for @xmath0-pentane the average c - c bond length 1.541  .",
    "the c - c distance varies slightly along the carbon chain , with the smallest values towards the ends and the largest values around the center of the chain , but the difference only amounts to 0.001  . for @xmath0-nonane",
    "the c - c bond lengths along the chain differ by 0.002  , again with the largest values around the center of the chain .",
    "we find similar bond lengths and bond length variations for the other alkanes .",
    "values of the average c - c bond length found by experiment @xcite for @xmath0-alkanes with @xmath63 to 7 are in the range 1.526  ( @xmath0-propane ) to 1.536  ( ethane ) .",
    "our results for the bond lengths thus deviate less than 1% from experiment .",
    "when an alkane molecule is adsorbed on graphene we find that the bond lengths are only slightly affected .",
    "for pentane the adsorbed molecule ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nalkanes ] ) has an average c - c bond length 1.543  , a change from the gas phase by 0.002  ( or 0.1% ) , and the bond lengths are still larger towards the middle of the chain ( 1.544  ) compared to the bonds at the ends of the chain ( 1.542  ) . for the other alkanes",
    "we find the average c - c bond length in the range 1.540  ( ethane ) to 1.544  ( octane and nonane ) , and for all alkanes the bonds towards the middle of the chains are longer than those at the ends .",
    "thus , structural changes caused by the adsorption are very small . energetically , the changes are also very small : using pbe for the reasons stated in the previous section we find the difference in total energy @xmath62 approximately 2 mev ( 0.2 kj / mol ) per c - c bond for all the alkanes studied here .",
    "all calculations of the adsorbed alkanes presented above are for an orientation with the alkane carbon skeleton parallel to graphene .",
    "we started out the process of optimizing the atomic positions with the carbon skeleton parallel to graphene , and all calculations reached an energetic minimum when parallel to graphene . to check if this is also the global minimum we further calculated the total energy for alkane molecules that initially were oriented with their carbon skeleton perpendicular to graphene , i.e. , rotated 90@xmath64 around their axis . for these , we also find a local minimum , but with a total energy larger ( less favorable ) than for the configuration with the backbone parallel to graphene .",
    "for example for pentane we find that the loss of total energy going from the perpendicular orientation to the parallel orientation is 48 mev ( 4.6 kj / mol ) .",
    "table [ tab : desorption ] lists the adsorption ( desorption ) energies obtained from theory by us and through tpd measurements by tait et al .  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : linear ] the calculated adsorption energy values grow linearly with the size of the alkane molecule , @xmath5 , with an off - set comparable to that from experiments .",
    "although the coverage of adsorbed alkanes in our calculation is 0.20.3 ml ( with full coverage defined as described further below ) the subtraction procedure involving the two first terms in ( [ eq : ed ] ) ensures that all direct alkane - alkane interactions are eliminated .",
    "thus our results should be compared with experimental results for single alkane molecules desorbed from otherwise clean and defectless graphene ( coverage 0 ml ) , @xmath12 .    in ref .  , the model used for describing the desorption energy @xmath13 as a function of the coverage @xmath29 and the number of alkane carbon atoms @xmath5 is @xmath65 the @xmath66 is the contribution from a defectless surface ( here : graphene ) in the absence of adsorbate - adsorbate interactions .",
    "the term @xmath67 accounts for the increase in desorption energy due to the interaction with other adsorbates on the surface , and the third term describes the effect of defects in the surface . the model is introduced in ref .",
    "for @xmath0-butane on mgo(100 ) . for general ( small ) @xmath0-alkanes on graphite the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70",
    "are given in table iv of ref .  .",
    "in our calculations graphene is defectless and there are no lateral interactions between molecules .",
    "therefore our adsorption energies @xmath10 should be compared with the experimental quantity @xmath12 , listed in table  [ tab : desorption ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : linear ] are shown the experimental results @xmath13 at @xmath71 ml , with error estimates within the shaded area ( from table iii of ref .  ) , and @xmath12 at zero coverage , together with our adsorption energies @xmath10 .",
    "comparing @xmath10 with @xmath12 we find that our theory adsorption energies deviate somewhat from the experimental results , with values from theory about 10% smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "hexane is an exception : our vdw - df value @xmath10 is 18% smaller than @xmath12 .",

    "the potential is calculated like @xmath75 in ( [ eq : ed ] ) but with the center of mass of pentane fixed at the distances @xmath76 from graphene .",

    "all internal atomic positions of pentane are allowed to relax .",
    "figure [ fig : curve ] shows that the potential is shallow around the adsorption position .",
    "for example , moving the center of mass of pentane 0.1  towards or away from graphene results in an energy increase of only about 1 kj / mol , or 10 mev . for our calculations",
    "we also report in table [ tab : desorption ] the distance @xmath30 between the center of mass of the molecule and the graphene sheet at the adsorption distance , which ranges from 3.64  ( methane ) to 3.96  ( hexane ) . because of the shallow minimum there is some uncertaincy in determining @xmath30 .",
    "although we subtract the direct alkane - alkane interactions from the adsorption energy it is in principle possible that small indirect alkane - alkane interactions remain if the molecules are placed too close , e.g. , closer than in a monolayer coverage .",
    "such indirect interactions would affect the atomic positions of alkane from nearby alkanes .",
    "we must therefore make sure that the alkanes are sufficiently far apart that such indirect interactions are negligible . to quantify this",
    ", we determined the coverage of alkanes in our calculations in units of ml , for each of the alkanes as well as for h@xmath8 and pe .",
    "we describe the coverage of molecules on graphene by fractions @xmath29 of a molecular ml .",
    "one ml is a one - molecule thick coating of a surface , as found by experiments . in order to find @xmath29 for our calculations we need to know for a full ml how many molecules cover a specified area of graphene , or how large an area @xmath31 does one molecule cover , in average .",
    "couto et al .",
    "@xcite found by means of stm that for various @xmath0-alkanes adsorbed on graphite the coating layer is highly ordered .",
    "the ordering at such high coverage is affected both by the adsorbate - adsorbate and the adsorbate - substrate interactions .",
    "disordered arrangement is only activated above a critical temperature . for most of the molecules we find the definition of 1 ml from experiments reported in the literature @xcite , but for methane , propane , and pentane we use an estimate based on a linear interpolation of the experimental data available for other values of @xmath5 , @xmath77 @xmath78 . from the values of @xmath79 and the sizes of our unit cells",

    "as summarized in table  [ tab : desorption ] , the coverages used in our study are always less than a third of a ml , with values @xmath85 , sufficiently sparse for indirect interaction effects to be neglected .",
    "almost all the available experimental results on alkane desorption from various surfaces derive from tpd measurements measuring the desorption rate @xmath86 . in order to extract the desorption energy from @xmath86",
    "the preexponential desorption rate @xmath87 was earlier often assumed to have the value @xmath88 s@xmath89 .",
    "this value is accepted as a reasonable value for first - order processes in surface physics of atoms and is derived from traditional transition state theory .",
    "however , the more complex processes of molecular desorption are not necessarily as well described by that particular value , nor more generally by a value that is constant for all @xmath0-alkanes .    the desorption rate @xmath86 may be described by the polanyi - wigner equation @xmath90 for @xmath0th order desorption , here @xmath91 . assuming a constant value of @xmath87 for the small ( @xmath92 )",
    "@xmath0-alkanes the tpd desorption rates give linear growth in @xmath13 with number of alkane segments @xmath5 but with a very large offset @xcite at @xmath6 .",
    "the offset is much larger than the segmental increment in @xmath13 .",
    "lei et al .  speculated @xcite , and tait et al",
    ".  showed from analysis of tpd experiments @xcite , that @xmath87 takes other and varying values in alkane desorption .",
    "this was shown for various surfaces like graphite , pt(111 ) and mgo(100 ) . by treating @xmath87 as a fitting parameter along with @xmath13 , modified and varying values of @xmath87 are found .",
    "such analysis leads to a more modest value of the offset of @xmath13 at @xmath6 , at the size of or smaller than the segmental increment in @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found @xcite that on graphite @xmath87 varies from @xmath93 s@xmath89 for methane to @xmath94 s@xmath89 for @xmath0-decane .",
    "thus the small molecules have a desorption prefactor similar to that from theory for atoms , whereas the prefactors for the larger molecules deviate strongly from this .",
    "taking these variations into account the desorption energy offset at @xmath6 is reduced to 7.11 kj / mol , with a segmental increment in @xmath13 of 8.50 kj / mol .",
    "similar results were obtained for small-@xmath5 @xmath0-alkane desorption from pt(111 ) and mgo(100 ) .",
    "it thus seems that the previously published large values of the @xmath6 offsets can mostly be explained @xcite as an effect of not allowing @xmath87 to vary for the small @xmath0-alkanes .",
    "nevertheless , an offset of a smaller size does remain even in the re - analyzed data .    in the literature the origin of the offset has been debated @xcite .",
    "even though the values of the offsets may be reduced as discussed above , also the remaining offset begs an explanation .",
    "lei et al .",
    "summarize the discussions by listing a number of suggested reasons : ( i ) the different binding to the surface of the methyl end groups ( -ch@xmath9 ) compared to the methylene segments ( -ch@xmath8- ) ;",
    "( ii ) the effect from the chain length dependence on the polarizability of the alkanes ; ( iii ) the effect of needing different temperatures for the various alkanes for measuring @xmath86 ; ( iv ) possibly the desorption process can not be described as a first - order process , e.g. , if the alkanes adsorb in islands or other structures ; ( v ) possible lattice mismatch of the alkanes with the surface ; and finally ( vi ) chain length dependence of @xmath87 .",
    "the latter suggestion reduces the offset to a more modest value , as discussed above .    without going into details of all of the above - mentioned suggestions",
    "we note that our calculations are in a sense more direct than the desorption energies derived from the tpd measurements . in our calculations",
    "the preexponential factor @xmath87 is not involved , temperature variation is not an issue , and we do not let the alkanes adsorb in islands .",
    "our results are in agreement with the results presented in ref .   where the approach of a variable desorption prefactor was used",
    ". in particular , our theoretically calculated value of the offset agrees very well with that obtained by tait et al .",
    "here we present a simple model study to discuss the suggestion ( i ) of end - group effects .",
    "our calculated adsorption energy for pe corresponds very well with our similarly calculated adsorption energy per segment of the alkanes ( when neglecting the offset ) .",
    "pe is similar to the alkanes , but it does not ( at least not ideally ) include methyl end groups . in our calculations",
    "we describe pe adsorbed on graphene by periodically repeating two ch@xmath8 units , thus explicitly avoiding end groups .",
    "we find ( table [ tab : desorption ] ) the adsorption energy per methylene unit in pe , 7.2 kj / mol , which corresponds very well to the energy 7.4 kj / mol we find per ( methylene or methyl ) unit for small @xmath0-alkanes .",
    "it is natural to expect that the two extra h atoms attached to the ends of the alkane molecules ( in the methyl groups ) also contribute to the adhesion , thus affecting the offset in the adsorption energy .",
    "we present a calculation of a h@xmath8 molecule adsorbed on graphene to test a hypothesis of simple additivity of @xmath5 methylene segments ( -ch@xmath8- ) and two additional h atoms .",
    "this is thus an even simpler model for @xmath0-alkane than adding methyl to the ends of a string of methylene segments .",
    "our calculation of h@xmath8 on graphene yields the adsorption energy 6.8 kj / mol . in the calculated curve for @xmath10",
    "the offset is 6.44 kj / mol .",
    "our results for pe and h@xmath8 fit nicely to this simple additivity model .",
    "the curve with slope derived from pe adsorption and offset derived from h@xmath8 adsorption is plotted in figure [ fig : linear ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "arguments raised against the end - group explanation have been that experiments @xcite for cyclic alkanes on cu(111 ) and pt(111 ) also show an offset for extrapolation to @xmath5 even though the cyclic alkanes do not have any end groups . however , those results were extracted using fixed values of @xmath87 and yield large offsets ( 36 kj / mol for pt , 19 kj / mol for cu ) both for the cyclic alkanes and their linear equivalents . in that analysis the effect directly on the desorption barrier from the end groups is estimated to 2 kj / mol per linear alkane for both pt and cu surfaces .",
    "we can not judge whether the value of the cyclic - to - linear difference in desorption barriers @xcite , 2 kj / mol , would remain after a re - analysis of the desorption energies with more variation of @xmath87 , along the lines of those of tait et al .",
    "we present a computational study of the adsorption of small @xmath0-alkanes on graphene using the van der waals density functional method vdw - df .",
    "recent desorption experiments @xcite have shown desorption barriers growing linearly with the size of the alkane molecule , but with an offset in the limit of zero length . here",
    "we reproduce in our calculations the linear dependence on the alkane length including an offset the same size as obtained by the experiments . with the help of our calculated adsorption energy of polyethylene and h@xmath8 molecules we argue that a simple additivity assumption of alkane methylene ( -ch@xmath8- ) units plus two extra h atoms for the alkane ends explains the size and origin of the energy offset very well . summing up",
    ", our calculations thus give support to the suggestion that the offset measured in @xmath0-alkane desorption experiments ( after correction for effects of varying @xmath87 ) can be explained by the @xmath0-alkane end groups being different from the methylene segments of the @xmath0-alkanes",
