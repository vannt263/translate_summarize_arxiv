    "with the advent of the hubble space telescope , observational cosmology has been capable of extending the study of galaxy formation and evolution to epochs corresponding to less than one third of the age of the universe .",
    "the extremely narrow psf produced by hst / wfpc2 images ( around 0.1 arcsec ) allow morphological classifications of galaxies at medium to high redshifts .",
    "the medium deep survey key project @xcite has been classifying field galaxies from hundreds of wfpc2 images , providing photometry in two bands ( f606w and f814w , which roughly correspond to standard @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) as well as morphology down to @xmath15 .",
    "these data allow the study of number counts selected by type in @xmath14 and @xmath13 bands ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1994 , driver et al .",
    "1995 , abraham et al .",
    "the results indicate that counts in elliptical and spiral galaxies match closely the predictions of non - evolving models , whereas the population of irregular / peculiar galaxies presents an excess over no - evolution estimations .",
    "the median redshift for spectroscopically confirmed galaxies is @xmath16",
    ".    inside knowledge of formation and evolution processes conforming the observed field galaxy population mixture requires additional data .",
    "spectroscopic studies will provide intrinsic luminosities as well as information about absorption and emission lines . besides , optical  infrared colours are sensitive to the stellar population content .",
    "optical emission comes mostly from young ob stars while the old stellar population dominates the infrared luminosity .",
    "in a recent paper , glazebrook et al .",
    "study the characteristics of the faint mds population through optical spectroscopy and near - infrared photometry .",
    "an excess of blue ellipticals is found in @xmath8 distributions compared to pure luminosity evolution models .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the characteristics of normal galaxies in mds fields through optical - infrared colours .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : a detailed account of the observations and data reduction processes is presented in section  2 .",
    "we present the number counts in @xmath17 band , compare them with previous observations and discuss the morphologies contributing at different magnitudes , in section  3 .",
    "sections  4 and 5 are dedicated to optical  infrared colour relations , the latter focusing on the blue spheroid population found .",
    "a search for extremely red objects is shown next .",
    "finally , a discussion of our results is presented in section  7 .",
    "the targets for our @xmath17band survey were chosen from the medium deep survey catalogue that can be accessed at the hst / mds archive ( http://archive.stsci.edu/mds/mds.cgi ) .",
    "our search was based on optimal positioning in the sky for our observing time and place , taking extra care not to bias the catalogue towards regions nearby quasars , active galaxies or other peculiar objects .",
    "we found a set of images taken under hst program gto5090 ( e.groth as principal investigator ) out of which 22 fields were selected .",
    "@xmath17-band images of the mds fields were obtained at the 2.2 m mpia telescope on calar alto , spain during the nights of 1997 february 18,20 and may 21 , with magic , a nir camera that uses a nicmos3 @xmath18 rockwell hgcdte array , with a pixel scale of 0.64 arcsec .",
    "we used the @xmath17 filter instead of standard @xmath0 to reduce the sky background , thereby reaching a fainter limiting magnitude .",
    "the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath17 stays below 0.01 mag if we consider the translation formula of wainscoat & cowie and a colour @xmath19 of a typical galaxy , given by a synthetic model @xcite .",
    "hence , we will denote with @xmath0 our @xmath17 magnitudes hereafter .",
    "five - second individual exposures were taken , adding up 12 of them into a single 1 minute file . between frames we nodded the telescope in steps of 10 arcseconds , following a path that closed in 9 steps .",
    "each field has three such sets totaling 27 minutes of integration time .",
    "several ukirt faint photometric standard stars were also imaged throughout each night .",
    "the fields were flatfielded using the median of the set of images for each field excluding that of the frame being processed .",
    "the complete sample comprises 29 fields ( table  1 ) which covers a 116.8 arcmin@xmath2 region in the @xmath0-band , with a 89.4 arcmin@xmath2 overlap with the hst / wfpc2 images . a translation from the hst / wfpc2 filters to standard @xmath13 and @xmath14 photometry",
    "is done using the transformation formulae from holtzman et al . and approximating @xmath20 to f606w@xmath21f814w .",
    "the additional correction terms are less than 0.01 mag .",
    "the object detection process was done using sextractor @xcite using a @xmath22 detection threshold .",
    "n is the number of connected pixels within one seeing disk .",
    "hence , the global threshold is @xmath23 .",
    "even though this value might be rather low for individual band detection , we are only considering those objects that appear _ both _ in the @xmath0 and mds-@xmath14 or @xmath13 images .",
    "we compared the aperture and isophote - fitting photometry from sextractor and iraf s qphot task using 4 , 5 and 6 arcsecond disks and found the maximum uncertainty to lie around @xmath24 down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath25 .",
    "eventually , we decided to use a 6 arcsec aperture photometry , which guarantees all of the flux from each object is measured .",
    "moreover , this is the same aperture used by glazebrook et al .",
    ", which allows a better comparison .    in order to match the wfpc2 and magic images , we retrieved individual hst frames for each field from the stsci archive ( with exposure times around 1,000 seconds ) and compared them to our nir images .",
    "we took several objects in each field to find the pixel - to - coordinate mapping .",
    "many of the images used in the survey overlap , and so we checked for objects appearing twice .",
    "table  2 shows the number of objects detected as well as the ratio of spheroids and disks in the sample ( bulge to disk ratio @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ) . as expected , the bias in imposing detection in all bands : @xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath0 implies a higher proportion of disks , compared to only imposing @xmath14 and @xmath0 detection .",
    "the completeness magnitude was estimated in two different ways : a quick method involves searching for the peak in the histogram of objects appearing both in @xmath0 and @xmath14 bands to make sure we were rejecting spurious detections .",
    "this method is only possible as long as we are working with images that are much deeper in @xmath14 than in @xmath0 , so that no severe bias is included by enforcing @xmath14 band detection . besides",
    ", the peak of the histogram will only show the completeness level as long as the luminosity function is monotonically increasing in the detection range ( which is our case ; see , for instance , fig .  1 ) .",
    "the second method consists of simulating a random field of pointlike galaxies with the luminosity function obtained from the literature ( cf .",
    "fig  1 ) and with the same sky noise and pixel size .",
    "we could have considered a sample of spheroids and disks in the simulated sample as the threshold of detection deals with surface brightness ; however , most of the galaxies from the mds catalogue had half - light radii well below 1.5 arcsec ( see , for instance , table  3 ) which was our resolution taking into account seeing conditions and pixel size . both methods yielded a completeness magnitude of @xmath3 .",

    "we construct the number counts in the nir with the objects detected by sextractor in the magic images which have counterparts in mds @xmath14 band frames . even though this might appear as a severe bias on the sample , it is not , as can be seen in figure  1 , where our @xmath31 sample is shown along with data from the literature .",
    "a strong bias would appear as a paucity of objects and thus a disagreement with previous @xmath0 band surveys .",
    "the only population that might drop out in this process would consist of blue irregular galaxies , which contribute negligibly to the luminosity function in our magnitude range ( @xmath32 ) .    the counts follow a @xmath33 relation with a slope of @xmath34 in the range @xmath35 .",
    "differential number counts versus @xmath0 magnitude of our sample are presented in figure  1 ( solid triangles ) , along with poissonian error bars . just for comparison , a no - evolution model ( solid line ) based on the luminosity function given by efstathiou et al .",
    "is also presented .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath36 and @xmath37 km / sec / mpc and a galaxy mixture ( including sfrs and imfs ) as prescribed by pozzetti , bruzual and zamorani .",
    "the @xmath38-corrections and colours are calculated for different types of galaxies using the spectral synthesis code from bruzual and charlot .",
    "the model has been normalized to the observations from the literature at @xmath39 ( the present sample not included ) .",
    "the no - evolution model is compatible with the observations down to our completeness magnitude .",
    "moreover , the nir number counts down to @xmath40 can not discriminate between no - evolution and passive luminosity evolution models @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the slope of the @xmath0 band number counts seems to flatten for the faintest magnitudes ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1995 , moustakas et al . 1997 ) .",
    "unlike many previous @xmath0 band surveys , now we have access to the morphology of the objects from the @xmath14 and @xmath13 band images classified by the mds group .",
    "figures  2 and 3 serve as a test of the contribution from each morphology to the counts in different bands .",
    "we plotted in figure  3 the fraction of the total number of galaxies detected in @xmath14 and @xmath0 ( top ) and in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath0 ( bottom ) versus the bulge to total luminosity ratio measured in @xmath14 .",
    "as in a typical field sample , the proportion of disk galaxies is higher than that of bulges . the percentage of the latter ( @xmath41 ) is smaller in the sample selected in @xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath0 than in the one selected in @xmath14 and @xmath0 alone .",
    "this result follows the ratios observed in the mds objects in the two filters @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( see table  2 ) . from figure  2 ( top )",
    ", one can notice that the ratio of bulges in field galaxies decreases as we go to fainter magnitudes , down to @xmath42 at @xmath43 , whereas the disk population comprises roughly 60% of the sample at the faint end .",
    "the contribution of the different populations to the differential number counts at different @xmath0 magnitudes is presented in figure  2 ( middle and bottom panels ) .",
    "one can see in both figures the trend indicated above : faint magnitude counts are clearly dominated by disks .",
    "figures  4a and 4b show the colour  magnitude relation for our sample in @xmath7 and @xmath8 . having the morphology of each object",
    ", we can go further and predict the colours that galaxies with a given morphology should have .",
    "the shaded regions in these figures show the range of colours expected for galaxies with redshift @xmath44 , according to the models of bruzual & charlot for two metallicities : one higher above solar ( @xmath45 ) and another lower than solar ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "all of them have a scalo imf defined for @xmath47 and an exponential star formation rate with a characteristic time @xmath48 .",
    "the morphology determines the value of @xmath48 : 1 gyr for bulges , 5 gyr for bulge + disk and @xmath49 ( i.e. constant sfr ) for disks .",
    "the formation redshift for all three models is @xmath50 .",
    "given the degeneracy which exists between age and metallicity ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) , we can account for a range of colours either by changing the formation redshift or by using different metallicities . in the figures we used the latter",
    ": we can see a lower metallicity shifts the colour blueward in the same way a lower formation redshift would .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the redshifts of these galaxies and so we can not compare the trajectory predicted by the models with the colours of mds galaxies .",
    "one is tempted , though , to use a @xmath51 relation from deep surveys @xcite ; however the spread in this relation is too large to produce a meaningful result .",
    "a colour  colour plot avoids the estimation of redshift , and is shown in figure  5 .",
    "the dotted , solid and dashed lines correspond to three different metallicities , namely : @xmath52=2.5,1.0 and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "the solar metallicity curve also gives the redshift as crosses , from @xmath53 ( blue - blue i.e. lower left corner ) up to @xmath54 in steps of @xmath55 .",
    "there is good agreement with the colour  colour trend for all three morphologies , although a range of metallicities ( or of formation redshifts ) is needed to account for quite a few of the galaxies .",
    "it is worth mentioning this issue as either age or metallicity can account for this range of colours .",
    "the few disks with a red @xmath7 and @xmath8 colours in figure  5 which fall away from the model predictions should be considered with care as they fall close to the detection limit in @xmath13 and @xmath14 and so the photometric error in these bands could be large .",
    "the result for spheroids is treated in the next section .",
    "finally , we left as an interesting exercise to compute the values estimated for the redshift using a purely photometric approach .",
    "this method compares the broadband colours with templates associated with the morphology of the galaxy , shifting the redshift until the predicted colours are compatible with the observations .",
    "the more bands used , the better estimation one should have .",
    "photometric redshift measurements can be thought of as a `` poor man s spectroscopy '' .",
    "previous work on the subject has achieved remarkable accuracy : brunner et al .",
    "did a multiband analysis which resulted in a dispersion @xmath56 up to @xmath57 .",
    "a deeper estimation of the uncertainties can be found in hogg et al . .",
    "in our case , we just have two colours ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , which drove us to use a simple method to estimate the redshift , namely : minimize the squared difference between predicted and observed colours , using for each morphological type the models described above with three different metallicities .",
    "we imposed as a valid estimation that which corresponded with a colour difference less than @xmath58 mag , which reduced the sample to roughly 45 % .",
    "the histogram of the objects can be seen in figure  6 , which has a median around @xmath6 . even though the value for the complete mds sample is @xmath59 , our lower redshift is reasonable as the nir survey done in the present work is only complete down to @xmath60 .",

    " accounted for by young stars . although the environment is totally different , this blueness is in agreement with the colours of some cluster ellipticals ( e.g. couch & sharples 1987 ) for which a recent episode of star formation must be considered in order to explain it @xcite .",
    "confirmation of the existence of blue ellipticals in mds fields appears in spectroscopic observations using the keck telescope ( forbes et al .",

    "the list of all 15 spheroids with their properties appear in table  3 .",
    "these blue early - type galaxies should be further studied as they might throw light on the galaxy formation process both in the field and in clusters .",
    "a search for extremely red objects ( eros ) was also undertaken on this sample .",
    "first of all we checked that none of the objects found _ both _ in the @xmath0 band images and the hst / mds catalog from the @xmath14 band frames had a colour characteristic of such sources ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "next , we considered those objects from our @xmath0 band images alone , which did not appear in the mds catalog and visually inspected both the nir and the hst / mds images ( the latter retrieved through the archive of the stsci ) .",
    "about half of the candidates detected in @xmath0 fell in a region which did not overlap with the hst @xmath14 or @xmath13 images .",
    "the other half had counterparts which were either very bright stars or galaxies which failed to adjust to the predetermined luminosity profiles . in either case , these objects were brighter than @xmath66 and so they had @xmath67 , i.e. bluer than the standard criterion for an extremely red object ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "hence , all the objects detected in our @xmath0 band images  at a completeness level of @xmath60  had counterparts in @xmath14 and had colours @xmath68 .",
    "the sample extends over 89.4 arcmin@xmath2 , which sets an upper limit for the number density of eros at @xmath10 arcmin@xmath11 ( for @xmath32 ) .",
    "in this paper we have performed nir photometry in 29 fields from the medium deep survey catalogue . the number counts obtained ( figure  1 ) for objects detected _ both _ in @xmath14 and @xmath0 band frames agree well with previous @xmath0 band surveys .",
    "this agreement is possible since the @xmath14 band images are deeper .",
    "the morphology obtained with high resolution images from hst / wfpc2 allows a segregated study of colour - magnitude and colour - colour relations for three different types according to the bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "as expected , spheroids appear redder in @xmath7 and @xmath8 than disks and there is a fairly good agreement with spectral evolution models @xcite using a formation redshift @xmath50 and taking into account a sensible range in metallicities ( @xmath69 ) , which is equivalent to assuming a range in formation redshift , keeping a fixed metallicity .",
    "a simple photometric redshift estimation was done , giving a median redshift @xmath6 which is reasonable given the completeness level of the @xmath0 band images .",
    "a further analysis along these lines would require fluxes in additional bands",
    ".    in agreement with previous observations , we found spheroids appear bluer than the model prediction for passive evolution , clearly showing the existence of ongoing star formation , similarly to the blueness detected in some cluster ellipticals . further study of this epoch of possibly strong star formation in the life of early - type galaxies will be of great importance in the understanding of galaxy formation .    in order to compare our results with previous nir surveys in mds fields @xcite",

    "yield a 100% confidence level .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the extra objects in glazebrook s sample as they go deeper in @xmath0 appear blueward of the peak , signalling the existence of galaxies with a stronger star formation rate , as expected for higher redshift galaxies .",
