    "the nonexistence of the strictly localized photon states @xcite and the associated lack of the photon position operator makes it impossible to formulate the uncertainty relation for photons in the standard heisenberg form . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that also for photons the spread of momentum and the extension in space are subjected to some restrictions that embody the famous heisenberg phrase @xcite `` je genauer der ort bestimmt ist , desto ungenauer ist der impuls bekannt und umgekehrt . ''",
    "our approach to the photon uncertainty relations is based on two precisely defined concepts : the photon wave function in momentum space and the energy density of the quantized electromagnetic field . in our previous publication",
    "@xcite we used the _",
    "second moment _ of the energy distribution to measure the spread of the photon states in coordinate space .",
    "this led us to the uncertainty relation for photons in the form @xmath1    in the present work , we define the uncertainty of the position for photons that would be analogous to the standard definition .",
    "for that we need some replacement for the ( nonexistent ) photon position operator .",
    "this role is played by @xmath2 , which is the center of energy ( or center of mass ) . the center of energy operator @xmath2 is directly related to the _ first moment _ of the energy distribution .",
    "this approach will allow us to obtain the uncertainty relation in a form even closer to the original heisenberg relation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of dimensions .",
    "a characteristic feature of the uncertainty relation for photons is that the left - hand side in this inequality in two and in three dimensions is never equal to @xmath5 , but it tends to this limit with the increase of the average photon momentum . only in the infinite - momentum frame is the uncertainty relation for photons the same as for nonrelativistic massive particles .",
    "however , in one dimension , the inequality ( [ two ] ) is saturated so that in this case there is no difference between photons and massive nonrelativistic particles .",
    "we also prove the following sharp inequality : @xmath6    in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , the inequalities obeyed by the two measures of uncertainty , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are completely equivalent .",
    "they have equal lower bounds and they are both saturated by gaussian functions .",
    "this equivalence does not hold for photons .",
    "nevertheless , the two inequalities are intimately related .",
    "we shall first prove ( [ three ] ) and then use the information about the photon states that saturate this inequality to elucidate the intricate properties of the inequality ( [ two ] ) .    an early attempt to base the uncertainty relation for photons on the center of energy @xmath2",
    "was made by schwinger @xcite , but he only gave a rough estimate that the lower bound of @xmath7 is of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to an uncertainty relation for single photons we derive a closely related uncertainty relation for photon beams . using coherent states of the electromagnetic field to describe such beams in the limit of a large number of photons we prove the following sharp inequality : @xmath10 and we find the mode functions of the coherent states that saturate this inequality .",
    "the nonexistence of the local photon density in configuration space is due to the fact that in quantum electrodynamics the operator of the total number of photons @xmath11 involves not a single but a double integral @xcite : @xmath12\\!:\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2\\hbar c}\\int\\!d^3r\\int\\!d^3r':\\!\\left[\\frac{{\\hat{\\bm f}^\\dagger}({\\bm r},t)\\!\\cdot\\!{\\hat{\\bm f}}({\\bm r}',t)}{|{\\bm r}-{\\bm r}'|^2}\\right]\\!:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use systematically the riemann - silberstein vector ( the rs vector ) @xcite @xmath13 which will allow us to write many formulas in a compact form .",
    "the normal ordering removes the ( infinite ) contribution from the vacuum state .",
    "in contrast to the total - number operator , the total - energy operator of the electromagnetic field @xmath14 ( the hamiltonian ) is an integral of a _ local _ density , @xmath15 where @xmath16    the center of the energy operator can be introduced in _ any relativistic theory_. all we need for this construction is the set of generators of the poincar group . following born and infeld @xcite , we define the operator @xmath2 as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the first moment of the energy distribution , @xmath19 the symmetrization in ( [ cm ] ) is necessary to obtain a hermitian operator .",
    "the inverse of the hamiltonian is well defined , provided we exclude the vacuum state .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian is nonnegative , therefore the positive square root is unique .",
    "the significance of @xmath18 is further underscored by its being the generator of lorentz transformations .",
    "since the operators @xmath20 and @xmath18 do not commute ( the energy changes under lorentz transformations ) , the equivalence of the two forms of @xmath2 in ( [ cm ] ) is not obvious and is proved in appendix a.    it follows from the commutation relations between the generators of the poincar group @xcite , @xmath21=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}{\\hat h},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that @xmath2 and the total momentum @xmath22 obey the canonical commutation relations between the position and momentum , @xmath23=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we must , however , resist the temptation to treat @xmath2 as a bona fide position operator because its components _ do not commute _",
    ", @xmath24=-i\\hbar c^2{\\hat h}^{-1}{\\hat s}_{ij}{\\hat h}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the operator of the intrinsic angular momentum : the difference between the total angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum , @xmath26 note that the effects of the noncommutativity are present in all systems with intrinsic angular momentum and decrease with the increasing energy .",
    "we shall fully confirm this observation in sec .",
    "despite all of the differences between the nonrelativistic and relativistic dynamics we may derive a sharp heisenberg uncertainty relation _ along one direction _",
    ", say @xmath27 , for any relativistic system .",
    "this one - dimensional uncertainty relation is based solely on the commutation relations between @xmath28 and @xmath29 and has the standard form @xmath30 where      the one - dimensional uncertainty relation holds for _ any relativistic quantum system_. a simple proof of ( [ hur ] ) uses the commutation relations ( [ comrn ] ) and the non - negative expectation value of the operator : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary real number . the condition that this expression treated as a function of @xmath33 can have at most one real root gives ( [ hur ] ) .",
    "this inequality is saturated by the quantum state whose state vector satisfies the condition @xmath34 the specific form of @xmath35 depends , of course , on the system under study .",
    "note that we may remove the average values @xmath36 and @xmath37 from ( [ sat1 ] ) by choosing @xmath35 in the form latexmath:[\\ ] ] without any loss of generality [ the function @xmath71 is at this point arbitrary and it will be determined from the variational procedure later ] , we can make the following replacement : @xmath210 this change of phase makes no difference in ( [ fin2 ] ) , but it leads to the elimination of the @xmath211-dependent terms in ( [ fin1 ] ) , and we obtain @xmath212    27 t. d. newton and e. p. wigner , rev .",
