    "now from the condition of stationary phase ( [ phase1 ] ) we can find @xmath137 where we have used @xmath138 .",
    "the stationary phase contributes only when @xmath139 because the spiral structure only exists in that range of distances from the centre of the vortex .",

    "the higher order terms are functions of @xmath147 , and decay faster than @xmath148 in the range @xmath149 , and can therefore be neglected .",
    "we notice that as time runs forward the spiral range @xmath150 shifts to higher values of @xmath84 which is solely due to the vortex continuously wrapping the scalar field in to finner and finner spirals thus generating scales which have higher wavenumbers .",
    "this range also shrinks as it shifts to higher values of @xmath84 because of the action of diffusion . in the next section",
    "we generalise our results to the case of multiple spirals generated by a dilute collection of noninteracting vortices which may be representative of a turbulent velocity field with coherent vortical structure , perhaps obtained in the experiments of jullien et al.@xcite .",
    "all the analysis in this section is carried out in dimensionalised variables so we invert the transformations of section [ sec1vor ] .",
    "let us consider many non interacting vortices randomly distributed over 2-d space and sufficiently far apart so that we can safely describe the velocity field in terms of compact vortical structures characterised by @xmath151 @xmath152 where the @xmath98 s are measured from the centre of each vortex at @xmath153 for all @xmath102 and @xmath154 for the calculation of the generalised power spectrum and structure functions we need only to consider the scalar patches within a distance @xmath4 of each vortex because these scalar patches acquire a spiral structure and thereby dominate the scaling of the structure functions .",
    "the scalar field at distances larger than @xmath4 from all vortices contributes an @xmath155 term to the structure function for @xmath23 because the interfacial structure of the scalar field far from the vortices remain regular . as we show in this section , this term is negligible in the @xmath156 limit compared to the @xmath47-dependence of the structure functions caused by the scalar spiral structures around the vortices .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider that @xmath157 consists only of the local scalar fields @xmath158 in the vicinity of vortices labelled @xmath102 and write @xmath159 every scalar spiral in the right hand side of ( [ mulvort1 ] ) is localised within a distance @xmath4 of @xmath153 and the condition ( [ discond ] ) ensures that they do not overlap each other .",
    "now we can generalise ( [ ft2 ] ) to include the effect of many non - interacting vortices with non - overlapping scalar spirals as shown below @xmath160 since the integrals are independent of the @xmath102 s we can take them out of the sum .",
    "hence we get the same result as in ( [ ft10 ] ) multiplied by the number of vortices per unit area , that is @xmath161 this asymptotic relation is valid when @xmath162 which is found from the condition @xmath163 in dimensionalised form and @xmath164 in the limit @xmath1 .",

    "after substituting ( [ mulft2 ] ) in ( [ stfunc2 ] ) and integrating we find @xmath170",
    "to achieve a statistically stationary passive scalar field we may imagine that , as scalar patches take spiral shapes and decay , more scalar patches are introduced in to the flow as may well happen in an experimental setup in the laboratory .",
    "this procedure soon leads to a situation where many scalar spirals coexist in the flow all in different stages of their evolution . assuming the rate of regular injection of the scalar blobs to balance exactly the rate of scalar dissipation",
    ", we can expect to have a statistically stationary scalar field . in this case",
    ", the averaging over many spirals in different stages of their evolution ( which is involved in the calculation of the generalised power spectra and structure functions ) may be assumed , in the spirit of lundgren@xcite , to be equivalent to averaging over the life - time of a single spiral .",

    "in this section we extract the phenomenology underlying the calculations and results of the previous sections and show that the essential ingredient of this phenomenology are the locality of scalar inter - scale transfer ( [ spctr1 ] ) and the lundgren time - averaging operation .",
    "indeed , as we show in this section , ( [ ft13 ] ) and ( [ ft15 ] ) can be retrieved by a simple phenomenological argument based on these two ingredients .",

    "the time averaged generalised power spectra in this range are given by @xmath209 and @xmath202 must be increasing functions of @xmath210 because the differential rotation s shearing process causes the power spectra to shift from small to large wavenumbers ( see figure 2 ) .",
