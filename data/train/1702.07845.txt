    "_ let us return to the case of ito . since @xmath121 can reach @xmath19 500 nm at low temperatures , the ito nanowires are very useful for the investigations of the 1d ucf phenomena .",
    "yang @xcite have recently carried out the magneto - transport measurements on individual ito nanowires with a focus on studying the ucfs .",
    "their nanowires were made by implanting sn ions into in@xmath0o@xmath1 nanowires .",

    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the nanowire axis . here ,",
    "after the first run at liquid - helium temperatures , the nanowire was thermally cycled to room temperature , at which it stayed overnight , and cooled down again for the magneto - transport measurements at liquid - helium temperatures .",
    "the thermal cycling to room temperature was repeated twice , and the sample was thus measured for three times at three different cooldowns .",
    "the idea was that a thermal cycling to 300 k could possibly induce _ impurity reconfiguration _ in the given nanowire .",
    "a new impurity configuration must lead to differing trajectories of the propagating electron partial waves , which in turn cause distinct quantum interference . as a result , the shape of the ucf patterns should be completely changed .",
    "figure  [ fig1-ucfs](a ) shows @xmath213 as a function of @xmath207 at several temperatures measured at the first cooldown .",
    "figure  [ fig1-ucfs](b ) shows @xmath211 as a function of @xmath207 at several temperatures measured at the second cooldown , and figure  [ fig1-ucfs](c ) shows those measured at the third cooldown .",
    "a number of important ucf features and the underlying physics can be learned from close inspection of these figures .",
    "( @xmath2 ) : :    inspection of figures  [ fig1-ucfs](a)(c ) indicates that the ucf    magnitudes decrease with increasing temperature and disappear at    @xmath5225 k. thus , these quantum conductance fluctuations    are distinctly different from the classical thermal noise whose    resistance fluctuation magnitudes increase with increasing    temperature . ( @xmath3 ) : :    during a given cooldown , the shape of the ucf patterns at different    temperatures remains the same to a large extent .",
    "this observation    implies that the impurity configuration is frozen for a considerable    period of time if the nanowire is constantly kept at liquid - helium    temperatures .",
    "a given impurity configuration gives rise to a specific    ` magneto - fingerprint , ' strongly suggesting that the ucf phenomena is a    robust manifestation of an intrinsic quantum - interference effect .",
    "( @xmath4 ) : :    at a given temperature , the ucfs among different cooldowns reveal    similar peak - to - peak magnitudes .",
    "( @xmath214 ) : :    figure  [ fig1-ucfs](d ) shows a plot of the    @xmath210=0.26k,@xmath215 curves taken    from figure  [ fig1-ucfs](a ) ( top curve ) and figure  [ fig1-ucfs](b )    ( middle curve ) , and their difference ( bottom curve ) .",
    "this figure is    convenient for close inspection and comparison .",
    "the top two curves    reveal completely different shapes of the ucf patterns , strongly    reflecting that a thermal cycling to 300 k has induced an impurity    reconfiguration . on the other hand ,",
    "the ucf magnitudes of these two    curves retain similar , with a peak - to - peak value of    @xmath216(@xmath35=0.26k )    @xmath217 for both curves .",
    "the reason for    retaining a similar ucf magnitude is as follows .",
    "the ucf magnitudes in    a given nanowire are governed by the @xmath121 values ,    which are determined by the level of disorder , i.e. , the    @xmath18 value ( or the @xmath136 value in 2d ) ,    see subsection 3.1.2",
    ". the @xmath18 ( @xmath136 )    value of a sample is determined by the total number of impurities , but    insensitive to the specific spatial distribution of the impurities    ( provided that the impurity concentration is uniform throughout the    sample ) .",

    ", the wire behaves as a single phase - coherent regime .",

    "if the temperature further increases such that @xmath227 or , equivalently , the thermal energy exceeds the thouless energy @xmath228 , one also has to take into account the _ thermal averaging _ effect .",
    "that is , the phase - coherent regime is now expected to be cut off by @xmath218 and the ucf magnitude @xmath223 is predicted to be suppressed by a factor @xmath229 .",
    "these theoretical concepts have been well accepted by the mesoscopic physics communities for three decades , but have rarely been experimentally tested in a quantitative manner .",
    "the lack of experimental information was mainly due to the fact that the ucfs could be observed only at temperatures below 1 k in conventional lithographic metal and semiconductor mesoscopic structures .",
    "fortunately , the observations of the ucfs in ito nanowires over a wide range of temperature from below 1 k up to above 10 k now provides us a unique opportunity to verify these subtle ucf theory predictions .",

    "the solid curves drawn through the data points are guides to the eye .",

    ".    generally speaking , granular metals are composite materials that are composed of finely dispersed mixtures of immiscible metal and insulator grains . in many cases ,",

    "three distinct regimes can be achieved in a given granular system , i.e. , the metallic , the insulating ( dielectric ) , and the metal - insulator transition regimes .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath247 is of order unity or somewhat smaller @xcite .    over decades",
    ", there has been extensive theoretical and experimental research on the microstructures and electrical - transport properties of granular systems @xcite .",
    "new discoveries have continuously been made and a good understanding of the physical properties conceptualized .",
    "for example , the giant hall effect ( ghe ) has recently been discovered in cu@xmath248(sio@xmath0)@xmath249 @xcite and mo@xmath248(sno@xmath0)@xmath249 @xcite granular films under the conditions that the grain size @xmath250 and the metal volume fraction @xmath251 is around the quantum percolation threshold @xmath252 @xcite .",
    "the ghe is a novel physical phenomenon which manifests a huge hall coefficient @xmath116 that is enhanced by @xmath523 orders of magnitude when @xmath251 approaches @xmath252 from the metallic side .",
    "the ghe is theoretically explained to arise from the local quantum - interference effect in the presence of rich microstructures in a metal - insulator composite constituting of nanoscale granules @xcite . while the single - particle local quantum interference causes the new ghe , in the following discussion we shall focus on the many - body electronic transport properties in granular systems .    in the rest of this section , we concentrate on the region with @xmath253 or @xmath254 .",
    "the material systems that we are interested in can thus be termed ` granular metals . ' in particular , we shall demonstrate that inhomogeneous ito ultrathin films are an ideal granular metal system which provides valuable and unique playgrounds for critically testing the recent theories of granular metals .",
    "these new theories of granular metals are concerned with the many - body electron - electron ( @xmath56-@xmath56 ) interaction effect in inhomogeneous disordered systems .",

    "the electrical - transport properties of granular metals have not been explicitly considered theoretically .",
    "it has widely been taken for granted that the transport properties would be similar to those in homogeneous disordered metals @xcite .",

    "the longitudinal conductivity correction @xmath265 originates from the renormalization of intergrain tunneling conductance @xmath239 , while the hall resistivity correction @xmath284 stems from virtual electron diffusion inside individual grains @xcite .",
    "as mentioned previously , the theoretical predication of equation  ( [ eq.(conductivity ) ] ) has been experimentally tested in a few granular systems . on the contrary , the prediction of equation  ( [ eq.(hall ) ] ) is far more difficult to verify in real material systems .",
    "the major reason is due to the fact that the @xmath285 magnitude ( @xmath286 ) in a granular metal with @xmath253 is already small and difficult to measure .",
    "obviously , the @xmath56-@xmath56 interaction induced correction term @xmath284 is even much smaller .",

    "thus , generally speaking , the hall coefficient , @xmath288 , in ito granular films would be @xmath522 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than those in conventional granular films made of normal - metal granules .",
