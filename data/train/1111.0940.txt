    "the phenomenon of neutral meson mixing has been the subject of extensive studies within the field of flavor physics in the last decades , and has provided a good deal of knowledge concerning the flavor structure of the sm and of its extensions @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the mixing of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons constrain very strongly the existence of sources of flavor violation beyond minimal flavor violation within the first to families , pushing the scale of generic flavor violating new physics far from the tev scale @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the knowledge we have of flavor transitions between the second and the third generation of quarks is not so precise . besides theoretical reasons to expect new physics to show its face in these type of transitions , there are already several experimental tensions that could be the effect of physics beyond the sm ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "an important focus of the lhc era is to probe @xmath10 physics to a novel level of precision , with the objective of clarifying these issues . in this context",
    ", the progress towards higher theoretical precision in @xmath10 physics is necessary .    in the case of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) without model dependent assumptions for the mecanism of supersymmetry breaking , the @xmath0 effective hamiltonian describing neutral meson mixing",
    "is known to nlo in strong interactions .",
    "leading order ( lo ) strong interaction matching conditions in the mssm have been known for some time , and were computed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; they arise from squark - gluino box diagrams .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections come from two loop diagrams , and have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the mass insertion approximation , and in the general case in refs .",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix for the complete set of operators has been computed at nlo in qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite , and a resummation of large logarithms related to large squark mass ratios in scenarios with hierarchical squark masses can be found in ref .",
    "a taste of the flavor constraints on the susy parameter space in the general mssm can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present time is a particularly appropriate moment to reanalyze the phenomenology of susy models because of the direct searches for susy particles that are being performed at the lhc .",
    "the experimental collaborations atlas and cms have already reported exclusion limits based on @xmath11 of data in searches for @xmath12 with zero @xcite or more charged leptons , and larger datasets up to @xmath13 are expected in the future .",
    "these limits , however , are model dependent , and the lower bounds on the susy masses vary from model to model . in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded below @xmath14 @xcite , but the bound on the gluino mass would be slightly higher ( @xmath15 ) for squarks around @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis including lhcb data , as well as electroweak precision and @xmath7-physics observables obtains best fit values of @xmath17 for the cmssm and @xmath18 for the nuhm1 @xcite . in the case of the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm )",

    "thus , the susy scale can still be low enough for flavor physics to impose substantial constraints on flavor - violating soft supersymmetry - breaking couplings in general versions of the mssm , and these constraints should certainly be reevaluated . at the same time",
    "this reevaluation should involve , as argued above , a novel level of theoretical precision .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 nlo strong interaction matching conditions were computed , putting all the quark masses to zero .",
    "this approximation is entirely justified since corrections to this limit are suppressed by a ratio @xmath25 . in the case of the top quark this suppression still exists , although it might not be so effective if the susy scale is below the tev , with @xmath26 .",
    "in such a case , it may be that the loop functions have numerical enhancements that compensate such suppression : a factor of @xmath27 is not unreasonable , at least in some regions of the parameter space . the only way to know",
    "if this happens is to compute explicitly these corrections .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify this issue , by making the two loop calculation and comparing the size of the corrections with the @xmath1 limit . after reviewing briefly the structure of the @xmath0 effective hamiltonian in section [ sec : heff ]",
