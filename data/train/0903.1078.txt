    "in the nearly one hundred years since the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) was introduced into neuroscience there have been a variety of methods used in attempts to establish a taxonomy of eeg patterns in order to delineate the correspondence between brain wave patterns and brain activity . over that time",
    "the single channel eeg time series has been interpreted as consisting of relatively slow regular variations called _ signal _ and the relatively rapid erratic fluctuations called _ noise_. this separation implies that the signal contains information about the eeg channels in the brain , whereas the erratic fluctuations are a property of a channel s environment and does not contain any useful information .",
    "recent studies have refined this engineering model and extracted information from the random fluctuations by concentrating on what is believed to be the scaling behavior of the time series .",
    "analysis of the second moment of the single channel time series shows an algebraic scaling in time , i.e. , @xmath0 the brackets denote a suitably defined averaging procedure and detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite , which measures the standard deviation of the detrended fluctuations , has been the method of choice for the recent analysis of eeg data @xcite .",
    "buiatti et al .",
    "@xcite use dfa to show that specific task - demands can modify the temporal scale - free dynamics of the ongoing brain activity as measured by the scaling index .",
    "the signal parts of the eeg time series are called waves or rhythms .",
    "the nature and scope of these waves have been widely investigated , see baar @xcite for a review . the alpha rhythm (",
    "7 - 12 hz ) has been shown to be typical of awake individuals under no stimulation .",
    "baar , along with colleagues , have developed an integrative theory of alpha oscillations in brain functioning @xcite .",
    "they hypothesize that there is not one , but several alpha generators distributed within the brain and note that the alpha rhythm may act as a nonlinear clock in the manner suggested by wiener @xcite to serve as a gating function to facilitate the association mechanisms in the brain .    as a measure of order / disorder ,",
    "entropy has been used to characterize eeg signals .",
    "schlgl et al .",
    "@xcite measured the entropy of 16 bits eeg polysomnograhic records and found it in the range of 8 - 11 bits .",
    "inouye et al .",
    "@xcite employed spectral entropy , as defined by the fourier power spectrum , but the fact that eeg time series are not stationary , in the sense that the autocorrelation function is not simply a function of the two - time difference , obviates the use of fourier transforms .",
    "subsequently , wavelet entropy was used by rosso et al .",
    "@xcite to study the order / disorder dynamics in short duration eeg signals including evoked response potentials .",
    "patel et al .",
    "@xcite , using a combination of mri and entropy maximization , demonstrated that the generators of alpha rhythm are mainly concentrated over the posterior regions of the cortex .",
    "the diffusion entropy ( de ) method @xcite has been successfully used to discriminate between the contributions of the low frequency waves ( signal ) and the high frequency fluctuations ( noise ) , e.g. , the influence of the seasons on the daily number of teen births in texas @xcite and the effect of solar cycles on the statistics of solar flares @xcite . in this letter",
    "we use the de method to provide insight on the low / high frequency dynamics of eeg time series .",
    "each single channel recording of the eeg time series consists of a sequence of @xmath1 data points , and the difference between successive data points is denoted by @xmath2 for @xmath3 . for the de analysis a set of stochastic variables @xmath4 is constructed from the differenced data points in the following way @xmath5 to obtain @xmath6 replicas of a stochastic trajectory by means of overlapping windows of length @xmath7 .",
    "this ensemble of trajectories , generated by the eeg time series , is used to construct the histogram using the number of trajectories falling in a specified interval to estimate the _ pdf _ @xmath8 the pdf is then used to calculated the information entropy , a quantity introduced in discrete form for coding information by shannon @xcite and in continuous form for studying the problem of noise and messages in electrical filters by wiener @xcite .",
    "we use the latter form here , @xmath9 the entropy @xmath10 of eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) assumes a simple analytical form if the pdf of the diffusion process satisfies the scaling relation : @xmath11 where @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 is a constant and @xmath15 for a gaussian diffusion process is the time - dependent standard deviation @xmath16 .",
    "more generally an @xmath17@xmath18 stable lvy process also scales in this way , in which case @xmath16 is more general than the standard deviation of the underlying process .    if the time series were scaling , as assumed in a number of analyses of eeg data @xcite ,",
    "the variance would be @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 and the entropy graphed versus time on log - linear graph paper would increase linearly with slope @xmath23 . consequently",
    ", the way in which the entropy for a time series scales is indicative of the scaling behavior of the time series .",
    "note that in a simple diffusive process this index is equal to the one obtained from the second moment , that is , @xmath23@xmath13@xmath24 .",
    "however , in general , even when there is scaling @xmath23@xmath25@xmath24 and in the case of eeg time series we establish that there is no scaling at all .",
    "we now consider eeg signals of 20 awake individuals in the absence of external stimulations ( quiet , closed eyes ) .",
    "eeg signals were recorded using the 10 - 20 international recording scheme . for 8 individuals only the channels o1,o2,c3 and c4 were recorded , for the remaining 12 individuals all the channels are available . to have a coherent database , we restrict our analysis to the channels o1,o2,c3 and",
    "c4 , which are the channels traditionally used in sleep studies .",
    "the sampling frequency of all eeg records is 250hz .",
    "durations of eeg records vary from 55s to 400s with an average duration of 128s .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows the de of the eeg increments for the somnographic channels o1,o2,c3 and c4 of a single individual .",
    "we see how for each channel the de : 1 ) reaches a saturation level for each channel , 2 ) has an `` alpha '' ( @xmath267.6 hz in the case of this individual ) modulation which is attenuated with time , and 3 ) has a small amplitude residual asymptotic modulation . the early - time modulation , with variable frequency in the alpha range and variable amplitude , is observed in the somnographic channels for all subjects .",
    "the saturation effect is present in all channels for all subjects and it should be pointed out that this saturation is neither a consequence of the finite length of the time series , nor of the finite amplitude of the eeg signal .",
    "in fact if the data points were randomly rearranged , thereby destroying any long time correlation in the time series , the eeg entropy does not saturate .",
    "consequently , this saturation effect is due to brain dynamics and is not an artifact of the data processing .",
    "robinson @xcite observed this saturation in the calculation of the eeg second moment and interpreted it as being due to dendritic filtering .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] depicts the _ _",
    "pdf__s @xmath27 , after the entropy saturation is attained .",
    "these distributions have approximatively exponential tails .",
    "the simplest dynamic model , which includes fluctuations , modulation and dissipation , in short , all the properties displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , has the form of a langevin equation . we assume a dissipative linear dynamic process @xmath28 , i.e. , an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , with a periodic driver having a random amplitude and frequency and an additive random force @xmath29 which is a delta correlated gaussian process of strength @xmath30 : @xmath31 \\sin \\left [ 2\\pi f_{j}t\\right ] \\label{sinusoidal}\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 defines a negative feedback , @xmath35@xmath36$]@xmath131 when its argument is in the time interval @xmath37@xmath13@xmath38 $ ] and is zero otherwise , and @xmath39 is the stability time after which a new frequency @xmath40 and a new amplitude @xmath41 are selected .",
    "the values of the frequencies @xmath40 and amplitudes @xmath41 are calculated as follow .",
    "first , we calculate the spectral density in the time - frequency domain of time series of eeg increments with a time resolution @xmath39 and a frequency resolution @xmath42 by means of a windowed fourier transform . the spectral density , called the spectrogram ( e.g. @xcite ) , is a three - dimensional plot of the spectrum of the eeg increments @xmath2 as it changes over time .",
    "then , for each time interval of duration @xmath39 we consider the range of frequencies of the alpha waves , 7 - 12 hz , and find which frequency has the maximum amplitude in the spectrogram .",
    "this procedure defines the frequency and the amplitude of the time interval considered .",

    "the standard deviation of the variable @xmath45 is @xmath46@xmath13 @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath7@xmath481/@xmath49 the entropy increases as @xmath10@xmath13@xmath50@xmath51@xmath52 , with @xmath50@xmath13@xmath12@xmath51@xmath53 @xmath54 and a linear - log plot yields a straight line of slope @xmath55@xmath13@xmath56 . for @xmath7@xmath571/@xmath49",

    "the first notable property of the langevin model is that it reaches a saturation level , indicating that the eeg signal asymptotically carries a maximum amount of information .",
    "the eeg entropy does not grow indefinitely as would a random process with long - time correlation.consequently , the eeg time series do not simply scale as had been previously assumed by a number of investigators @xcite .",
    "the second notable property of the langevin model is related to the first and is the dissipation , or negative feedback , produced locally within the channel of interest .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relation of einstein is what produces the maximum level of the entropy in a closed physical network , and is given by the ratio of the strength of the additive fluctuations to the dissipation rate . in the more general langevin equation given here",
    "we do not expect the saturation level to be given by this ratio alone , but to depend on the asymptotic value of the variance @xmath61 .",
    "note that the asymptotic variance may not be independent of time , but contains residual information in the form of low amplitude beats because of its dependence on the random near - periodic driver .",
    "this mechanism also explains the saturation observed earlier @xcite by associating the negative feedback with the dedritic filtering of the signal .",
    "the third notable feature of the langevin model is the attenuated oscillation of the entropy in time .",
    "the attenuation occurs in the eeg entropy because the alpha rhythm is not being generated at one source , but is described as a collective property of the brain in that it is being generated at a number of different locations @xcite . here",
    "the influence of the distributed sources is modeled by wave packets that persist for a stability time @xmath39 ; one packet is replaced by another with a slightly different carrier frequency and amplitude chosen from the empirical spectrogram every time interval of length @xmath39 .",
    "the concatenation of these wave packets with fluctuating frequencies and amplitudes produces a decoherence that attenuates the modulation of the resulting eeg entropy in time .",
    "we show in the sequel that an average over a gibbs ensemble of phase fluctuations of a harmonic driver in a linear dissipative langevin equation can be solved analytically to obtain the variance @xmath62 .",
    "the constants @xmath12 and @xmath63 are determined by the distribution of amplitudes and frequencies given by the spectrogram , and @xmath64 is the frequncy of the oscillation observe in the de plot .",
    "this analytic expression reproduces the resulsts of de inllustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "consequently , this modulation of the eeg entropy indicates that the channel is coupled coherently to the rest of the brain .",
    "the presence of the alpha rhythm modulation masks @xcite any early - time scaling property of the eeg dynamics .",
    "( [ sinusoidal ] ) is the simplest form of a fluctuation - dissipation process that implies the presence of internal feedback to prevent the occurrence of large excursions of the electric potential inside the brain .",
    "the presence of this negative feedback mechanism cast doubts on the possibility of considering an eeg record as the sum of two independent components , noise and trend , which is the usual assumption made for the dfa method .    finally , the analysis presented in this letter support the notion that alpha rhythms @xcite : 1 ) are not generated by one but by a number of spatially distributed sources , whose relative incoherence produces the attenuated modulation of the eeg entropy ; 2 ) are not merely noise but are random and near - periodic ; and 3 ) do not represent passive states , but may deteremine how different parts of the brain communicate .",
