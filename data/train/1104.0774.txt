    "random fields are a useful tool for modelling spatial phenomena such as environmental fields , including for example , hydrology , geology , oceanography and medical images . particularly important",
    "is the fact that in many cases these random fields have an anisotropic nature in the sense that they have different geometric characteristics along different directions ( see , for example , davies and hall ( @xcite ) , bonami and estrade ( @xcite ) and benson , et al.(@xcite ) ) .",
    "moreover , many times the model chosen has to include some statistical dependence structure that might be present across the scales . for this purpose , the usual assumption of self - similarity is formulated .",
    "unfortunately , the classical notion of self - similarity ( see @xcite ) , defined for a field @xmath0 on @xmath1 by @xmath2 for some @xmath3 ( called the hurst index ) , is genuinely isotropic and therefore has to be changed to fit anisotropic situations . + for this reason , there has been an increasing interest in defining a suitable concept for anisotropic self - similarity .",
    "many authors have developed techniques to handle anisotropy in the scaling .",
    "the main papers that have to be mentioned in this context are those of hudson and mason , schertzer and lovejoy ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "+ this motivated the introduction by bierm , meerschaert and scheffler of operator scaling random fields ( osrf ) in  @xcite .",
    "these fields satisfy the following scaling property : @xmath4 for some @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 with positive real parts of the eigenvalues . +",
    "a large class of random fields obeys this property .",
    "for example the fractional brownian field ( fbm ) and the fractional brownian sheet ( fbs ) are both operator scaling gaussian random fields ( osgrf ) with exponent @xmath7 .",
    "denote @xmath8 the euclidean scalar product of @xmath9 defined for any @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "recall that the fbs is the gaussian field @xmath13 defined for some @xmath14 as : @xmath15 .",
    "this gaussian field enjoys with the following scaling property : for all @xmath16 @xmath17 in particular , if we set @xmath18 , we recover that @xmath19 that is @xmath20 satisfies property  ( [ eqautosimhermine ] ) with @xmath7 and @xmath21 .",
    "+ in  @xcite the existence of osrf with stationary increments in the stable case for any @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 with positive real parts of the eigenvalues is proved .",
    "a special class of osrf is defined through its harmonizable representation . for gaussian models , which is here",
    "the case of interest , it reduces to consider an integral representation of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a positive valued function defined on @xmath9 satisfying @xmath24 for any norm @xmath25 on @xmath9 .",
    "such a function @xmath23 is called * a spectral density*. in order to recover the scaling property  ( [ eqautosimhermine ] ) , the spectral density @xmath23 is required to satisfy additional specific homogeneity properties ( see section  [ sectwo ] below ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "such spectral densities are defined by an integral formula .",
    "this is a non explicit definition in the sense that actual computations require numerical approximations .",
    "however , these calculations are , in practice , quite difficult to implement .",
    "nevertheless , a simpler and explicit formula is furnished in the particular case of diagonalizable matrices .",
    "+ in this paper , we mainly aim at providing * a complete description through explicit formulae * for the spectral densities in the model defined in  @xcite .",
    "we focus on a specific case : the * gaussian * model .",
    "the motivation of this restriction is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", it is a reasonable assumption in many applications ; on the other hand , to improve the model , it is necessary to understand and classify its geometrical properties which is easier in the gaussian case .",
    "+ our main results are stated and proved in section  [ secfour ] . the first ones , lemma  [ lemcas1 ] , lemma  [ lemcas2 ] , lemma  [ lemcas3 ] and lemma  [ lemcas4 ]    1 .",
    "reduces the construction of an explicit example of osgrf for a fixed matrix @xmath6 and an admissible hurst exponent @xmath26 ( as defined in section  [ sectwo ] ) to four particular cases related to specific geometries , 2 .   provides an explicit example in each of these four specific cases .",
    "thus , we are able to provide an explicit example of osgrf satisfying equation  ( [ selfsimilar ] ) and then extend the already existing results .",
    "moreover , our second result theorem [ ttransfert ] , gives a very simple relationship existing between all possible spectral densities associated to a given exponent @xmath6 .",
    "this result is not formal and can also be turned into an algorithm which generates different fields  with different geometries  satisfying equation  ( [ selfsimilar ] ) for the same matrix of anisotropy @xmath6 .",
    "these results have important consequences .",
    "firstly , it allows to define the studied class of osgrf from four specific cases .",
    "furthermore we give a complete description of the whole class of spectral densities of these fields .",
    "finally , since our construction is explicit , the numerical simulations of osgrf become much easier .",
    "thus , our approach provides an explicit definition of an interesting and large class of fields for simulations of textures with new geometries .",
    "there is actually a practical motivation to be able to compare natural / real images ( of clouds , bones , ... ) and models with controlled anisotropy .    in the following pages ,",
    "we are given @xmath27 and @xmath6 a @xmath5 matrix with positive real parts of the eigenvalues .",
    "we define @xmath28 for any @xmath29 recall that @xmath30 is defined as follows @xmath31 as usual , @xmath32 denotes the transpose of the matrix @xmath6 .",
    "+ we denote @xmath33 the euclidean norm defined for any @xmath10 as @xmath34",
    "let us recall some preliminary facts about operator scaling random fields ( osrf ) and operator scaling gaussian random fields ( osgrf ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for all the material of this section .    a scalar  valued random field @xmath35 is called operator  scaling if there exists a @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 with positive real parts of the eigenvalues and some @xmath36 such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes equality of all finite - dimensional marginal distributions .",
    "matrix @xmath6 and real number @xmath26 are respectively called an exponent ( of scaling ) or an anisotropy , and an hurst index of the field .    in general , the exponent @xmath6 and the hurst index @xmath26 of an osrf are not unique .",
    "thus the usual notion of self - similarity is extended replacing * usual scaling * , ( corresponding to the case where @xmath7 ) by * a linear scaling * involving matrix @xmath6 ( see figure  1 below ) .",
    "it allows to define new classes of random fields with new geometry and structure .",
    "[ fig1 ]        @xmath39 , @xmath40        @xmath41 , @xmath40        @xmath42 , @xmath40    action of a linear scaling @xmath43 on a ellipsis .",
    "as said in the introduction , when the matrix @xmath6 is given , the class of osrf with exponent @xmath6 may be very general . in  @xcite , for any given admissible matrix @xmath6 ,",
    "the existence of osrf with stationary increments is proved using a harmonisable representation .",
    "+ recall that according to  @xcite or @xcite , given a stochastically continuous gaussian field with stationary increments @xmath44 , its covariance can be represented as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a @xmath5 non  negative definite matrix and @xmath47 a non  negative symmetric measure @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for any norm @xmath25 on @xmath9 .",
    "measure @xmath47 and matrix @xmath46 are proved to be unique .",
    "measure @xmath47 is called the spectral measure of @xmath44 . in the case where this measure is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure",
    ", the density function of @xmath47 is called the spectral density of the gaussian field @xmath44 . in this case , the gaussian field @xmath44 can thus be represented as @xmath49 with @xmath50 for any norm @xmath25 on @xmath9 .",
    "this representation is then called the harmonisable representation of the gaussian field @xmath44 .",
    "+ to prove the existence of osrgf with stationary increments for any admissible matrix @xmath6 , a quite natural approach is then to use a harmonisable representation of the form  ( [ eqharmrepgene ] ) . in  @xcite , the following result is proved .",
    "we state it only in the gaussian case :    [ thdefx ] let @xmath51 a continuous function defined on @xmath52 with non  negative values such that for all @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "assume that @xmath51 is @xmath55-homogeneous that is : @xmath56 then the gaussian field @xmath57 defined as follows @xmath58 exists and is stochastically continuous if and only if @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , this field has the following properties :    1 .",
    "stationary increments , that is for any @xmath60 @xmath61 2 .",
    "operator scaling : the scaling relation  ( [ eqautosimhermine ] ) is satisfied .    through this new class of gaussian fields , even if it is a quite general model , we do not describe the whole class of osrgf with stationary increments .    if @xmath62 , @xmath63 is proved to be a spectral density in the sense that  ( [ eqsdgene ] ) holds .",
    "moreover , the spectral density of the gaussian field @xmath57 is @xmath23 .",
    "observe that @xmath23 is continuous and satisfies a specific homogeneity assumption .",
    "this homogeneity assumption is necessary for the operator scaling property of the gaussian field @xmath64 whereas the continuity assumption ensures that the field @xmath64 being defined is stochastically continuous .",
    "the main difficulty to overcome is to define * suitable spectral densities * of this new class of gaussian fields using continuous , @xmath32-homogeneous functions with positive values . in  @xcite such functions",
    "are called * @xmath65 pseudo - norms*. they can be defined using an integral formula ( see theorem  2.11 of  @xcite ) :    function @xmath51 defined as @xmath66 is continuous with positive values and @xmath32-homogeneous . here",
    "@xmath67 denotes the unit sphere of @xmath68 for a well chosen norm defined from @xmath6 and @xmath47 a finite measure on @xmath67 .",
    "remark that this formula is not the most appropriate for numerical simulations since we need to approximate an integral . in",
    "what follows , we will give simpler examples of @xmath65 pseudo - norms in the sense that these examples lead to * exact * numerical computations .",
    "we then conclude that we give * explicit * examples of @xmath65 pseudo - norms ( in the numerical sense ) .",
    "we also refer to p.g.lemarie ( see @xcite ) whose definition of @xmath65 pseudo - norms is slightly different ( see remark  [ rem : pgl ] below ) .    finally , in the special case where matrix @xmath6 is diagonalizable , an explicit expression is given ( corollary @xmath69 of  @xcite ) :    let @xmath6 a diagonalizable matrix with positive eigenvalues @xmath70 with associated eigenvectors @xmath71 and @xmath72 . then for any @xmath73 @xmath74 is a continuous , @xmath32-homogeneous function with positive values .    in this paper , we aim at extending these results and then describing for any given admissible matrix @xmath6 and hurst index @xmath26 , all the spectral densities of this model of osgrf with stationary increments in an * explicit * way .",
    "as has already been said in section  [ sectwo ] , the main difficulty is to define appropriate spectral densities of the model . to this end , we note that the class of the spectral density used in  @xcite is intimately related to the class of the so - called * pseudo - norms * defined in  @xcite .",
    "we then explicit the link between two @xmath75 pseudo - norms when the matrix @xmath6 is given . thereafter using a jordan reduction , for each matrix @xmath6 with positive real parts of the eigenvalues",
    ", we give an explicit example of a suitable spectral density of the studied model .",
    "combining these two results , we entirely describe * in a explicit way * the class of spectral densities of the gaussian fields considered in  @xcite .",
    "let us first recall some well known facts about pseudo - norms which can be found with more details in  @xcite .",
    "this concept is fundamental when defining anisotropic functional spaces since using pseudo - norms allows to introduce anisotropic topology on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , even if the introduction of this concept is not necessary to the definition of spectral densities , it is of great importance to relate the notion of anisotropic spectral densities to the concept of pseudo - norms .",
    "this gives us indeed all the tools of `` anisotropic functional analysis '' to study , for example , the sample paths properties of the fields in anisotropic spaces ( see  @xcite ) and to better understand the inherent topology of these spaces .        [ rem : pgl ] our definition of @xmath75 pseudo - norm is a slightly modified version of the concept of pseudo - norm on @xmath78 defined by p.g.lemari in  @xcite . in  @xcite , @xmath79 denotes a matrix with eigenvalues having a modulus greater than one .",
    "a pseudo - norm on @xmath78 is a function satisfying properties @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the previous definition and the following property : @xmath82 further for any @xmath5 matrix @xmath79 with eigenvalues having modulus greater than one and any compactly supported smooth function @xmath83 , an example of pseudo - norm on @xmath78 is provided by @xmath84 remark that if @xmath51 is a @xmath85 pseudo - norm then @xmath86 is a pseudo - norm on @xmath78 in the sense of @xcite with @xmath87 for any given @xmath29 .",
    "the properties satisfied by @xmath85 pseudo - norms are very similar to those of pseudo - norms on @xmath78 , as proved in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the example of pseudo - norm on @xmath78 given in  @xcite can be adapted to our case .",
    "indeed for any compactly supported smooth function @xmath83 @xmath88 is a @xmath85 pseudo - norm .",
    "this formula also leads to numerical approximations and thus is a non explicit one .",

    "then the function @xmath97 is continuous , positive on @xmath95 and satisfies for all @xmath29 , @xmath98 in particular , for a fixed @xmath99 and @xmath100 , it follows that @xmath101 the converse is straightforward .",
