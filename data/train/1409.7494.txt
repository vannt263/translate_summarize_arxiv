    "whether quantum or classical , electromagnetic or acoustic , wave phenomena share a common theoretical ground . hence the universality of fundamental concepts such as coherence , ballistic to diffuse transition , localization , and the observation of related experimental manifestations in all fields of mesoscopic wave physics  @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in the coherent field i.e. , the statistical average of the wavefield propagating in an inhomogeneous medium whose characteristic are treated as random variables . in mesoscopic physics , determining the coherent field is the very basis of multiple scattering theory .",
    "it allows to define a scattering mean - free path @xmath0 , which is the key - parameter in any multiple - scattering problem .",
    "@xmath0 is the typical decay length for the intensity of the coherent wave . in the case of a dilute suspension of discrete scatterers embedded in an homogeneous fluid ,",
    "@xmath1 is equal to the scattering cross - section of a single scatterer , multiplied by the number of scatterers per unit volume @xcite .    unlike discrete media , what we consider here",
    "is an inhomogeneous medium which varies continuously in space . in that case , heterogeneity can be characterized by a random function of the spatial coordinates , called the potential . in this paper , we show that the classical approach to express @xmath0 as a function of the fluctuations @xmath2 and correlation length @xmath3 of the potential is incorrect .",
    "this is due to an additional term in the acoustic wave equation , which is usually overlooked .",
    "when both terms have identical amplitudes , the correct value for the scattering mean - free paths is four times smaller ( 13/3 , precisely ) in the low frequency limit , no matter how weak the fluctuations are and whatever the shape of the correlation function ( as long as its second - order moment is finite ) . as a result , even in the most simple cases ( e.g. , exponentially - correlated disorder )",
    "the scattering mean - free path can be severely underestimated .",
    "the theoretical framework of the present paper is the diagrammatic approach of multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "it yields an exact equation for the coherent field known as dyson s equation , the essential ingredient of which is the self - energy @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , as often in real life , one has to resort to some degree of approximation to evaluate @xmath4 and obtain tractable expressions for the coherent field .",
    "the coherent wave has been extensively studied in the literature with various kinds of waves , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , in the case of continuous heterogeneous media the starting point is usually a wave equation in which disorder is introduced by a space - dependent wave velocity @xmath5 : @xmath6 assuming linearity and time - invariance , in order to determine the wavefield @xmath7 generated by any distribution of sources @xmath8 it suffices to know the green s function @xmath9 i.e. , the solution of eq .   when the source term is @xmath10 , with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "an essential point is that in eq .",
    "heterogeneity is fully characterized by a random _ scalar _ @xmath5 .",
    "the average green s function @xmath11 , hence the coherent field @xmath12 , can be calculated , provided the statistical properties of @xmath5 , particularly its correlation function , are known .",
    "here we are interested in a very simple case in which the usual approach fails .",
    "we consider an acoustic wave propagating in a lossless heterogenous fluid .",
    "it is well known that the wave equation for the acoustic pressure does not take the form of eq .",
    ": it entails an additional term with a random _ operator _ , instead of a simple scalar  @xcite .",
    "the operator term is usually neglected when dealing with multiple scattering of waves .",
    "this implies an important error in the calculation of the mean - free path , especially at low frequencies . to our knowledge , this point has been overlooked so far .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite derived a dyson equation in the case of isotropic solids with weak fluctuations of density and lam coefficients ; yet the liquid limit ( no shear modulus ) of this model does not exactly yield the correct mean - free path for a fluid , as will be discussed later .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly recall the basics of the diagrammatic approach of multiple scattering , applied to the standard wave equation , and show why this is inappropriate in the case of acoustic waves .",
    "section [ calculsoperateur ] gives a complete solution of the wave equation for the average acoustic pressure . under the bourret approximation",
    ", we show that the self - energy @xmath4 exhibits three additional terms compared to the standard scalar case .",
    "therefore section [ calculsoperateur ] , particularly eq .  , is the core of the paper . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss the importance of these additional terms in the simple situation of an exponentially - correlated disorder .",
    "numerical experiments based on averages of numerous simulations of the complete wave equation are found in very good agreement with the theoretical results .",
    "supplementary calculations and numerical details are presented in the appendix .",
    "let us consider first a homogenous and lossless medium , with a constant sound speed @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding green s function and its fourier transforms will be denoted @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . in the monochromatic regime , @xmath15 is the solution of helmholtz equation : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the angular frequency , and @xmath19 is a reference wavenumber . with the condition of causality , in unbounded 3-d space we have : @xmath20 with @xmath21 the dual variable for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the tilde @xmath24 denotes a spatial fourier transform . in the sequel ,",
    "the analysis is performed in the frequency domain and the @xmath18-dependence is dropped for brevity .      assuming that a heterogeneous medium can be simply characterized by a space - dependence of the wave speed amounts to replacing @xmath13 by @xmath5 in the wave equation .",
    "then it is convenient to define the scalar potential @xmath25 : @xmath26 the monochromatic green s function @xmath27 in the heterogeneous medium is such that @xmath28    note that in eq .",
    "@xmath29 is a reference speed which could be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "it is often convenient to set @xmath30 so that @xmath31 ; the brackets denote an ensemble average .    for media such that the typical speed fluctuation @xmath32 is much smaller than the average speed @xmath33 , eq .",
    "amounts to choosing @xmath34 , hence the reference speed is actually the average sound speed , but this is not true in the general case .",
    "the potential @xmath25 fully characterizes the heterogeneity , in that it measures the gap between the reference and the actual wave speed , at any point in space .",
    "the term _ potential _ comes from quantum mechanics , where the relevant wavefield is the complex amplitude of probability and obeys schrdinger equation , in which case the heterogeneity of the medium is an actual potential energy  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath25 is simply a dimensionless function of the space coordinate @xmath35 .",
    ".   is similar to eq .",
    ", with a source term @xmath36 that entails the green s function itself .",
    "hence @xmath37 can be expressed implicitly in a recursive manner ( lippmann - schwinger form ) as : @xmath38 for an arbitrary source distribution , the resulting wavefield at @xmath35 would be @xmath39    substituting @xmath37 under the integral by the right - hand side of eq .   and reiterating the process yields an exact expression for @xmath37 as an infinite sum of multiple integrals , known as born s expansion : @xmath40    the single - scattering approximation ( which is commonly made in imaging of weakly heterogeneous media ) consists in neglecting all terms beyond the first integral on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "in that case the green s function @xmath37 can be easily computed for any function @xmath25 , and the inverse problem ( i.e.reconstructing @xmath25 from @xmath37 ) may be solved .",
    "naturally this approach completely fails as soon as multiple scattering is not negligible .    in this paper",
    ", we consider multiple scattering of waves but we do not aim at solving eq .  .",
    "considering @xmath25 as a random variable with known statistical parameters , we are interested in the statistical average @xmath41 of the wavefield , which amounts to determine @xmath42",
    ". we will refer to it as the _ coherent _ field .",
    "this approach implies that we consider a given medium as one particular realization , among the infinity of possible outcomes , of the same random process . from a physical point of view , what an experimentalist would measure with a source distribution @xmath43 and a point receiver at @xmath35 is @xmath44 , not @xmath45 .",
    "but @xmath44 can be formally written as @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( i.e.a mean term plus statistical fluctuations , changing from one realisation to an other ) . how @xmath45 can be estimated in an actual experiment , and",
    "how robust the estimation is , is not our concern in the present paper .",
    "we focus on theoretical calculations for @xmath48 , derived from the statistical properties of @xmath25 . by taking the average of the born expansion",
    ", this will obviously require to know the statistical moments of @xmath25 with any order @xmath49 ( i.e.quantities such as @xmath50 ) .    the diagrammatic theory of multiple scattering shows that @xmath51 obeys an exact equation , known as dyson s equation  @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient in dyson s equation is a quantity @xmath4 referred to as the self - energy or the mass operator in the literature .",
    "@xmath4 can be fully determined by the statistical properties of @xmath25 , and takes into account all orders of multiple scattering . in a nutshell ,",
    "the basic idea is to rewrite the statistical average of eq .",
    "as an implicit , recursive expression for @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting dyson s equation reads : @xmath52 assuming that the medium is statistically homogeneous ( i.e. , its statistical parameters are invariant under translation ) @xmath53 only depends on @xmath54 , and since so does @xmath55 , eq .",
    "is a double convolution product on the variable @xmath56 .",
    "hence it can be simply solved by a spatial fourier transform , which yields @xmath57 where @xmath21 is the dual variable for @xmath56 .",
    "assuming further that the medium is statistically isotropic ( i.e. , its statistical parameters are also invariant under rotation ) , both @xmath58 and @xmath59 only depend on @xmath60 .",
    "the key issue is naturally to determine @xmath4 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath4 can be written as a pertubative development in @xmath61 , an infinite series of integrals involving statistical moments of @xmath25 at all orders , which can be represented by the following diagrams    @xmath62(\\value{tempb},0){\\value{tempa}}{0}{180 } }           { \\psline(1,0)(7,0 ) }           { \\pscircle(1,0){1 } }           { \\pscircle(7,0){1 } }        \\end{diaga}+        \\begin{diagb}{14 }           {     \\setcounter{tempa}{13 }     \\addtocounter{tempa}{-1 }     \\divide \\value{tempa } by 2     \\setcounter{tempb}{1 }     \\addtocounter{tempb}{13 }     \\divide \\value{tempb } by 2     \\psarc[linestyle = dashed](\\value{tempb},0){\\value{tempa}}{0}{180 } }           { \\psline(1,0)(7,0 ) }           { \\psline(7,0)(13,0 ) }           { \\pscircle(1,0){1 } }           { \\pscircle(7,0){1 } }           { \\pscircle(13,0){1 } }        \\end{diagb}+\\ldots\\ ] ]    following the usual conventions , a continuous line joining two points represents the free - space green s function @xmath55 between these points ; a dashed line linking @xmath49 points is the @xmath49-order moment of @xmath25 multiplied by @xmath63 .",
    "the inner points of a diagram are dummy variables . for the establishment of equation  , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "the bourret approximation ( a.k.a.first-order smoothing approximation ) only keeps the first two terms in the perturbative development of @xmath4 .",
    "this yields a simple analytical expression for @xmath4 as a function of the first and second - order moments ( i.e.the mean @xmath64 and correlation function @xmath65 ) .",
    "note that the bourret approximation does not imply at all that multiple scattering terms are neglected beyond second - order scattering , but rather than all multiple scattering events are assumed to be similar to a succession of uncorrelated single or double - scattering sequences .    under the bourret approximation , and",
    "having chosen @xmath13 such that @xmath66 , the expression for the self - energy is  @xcite : @xmath67    the last step is to determine the average green s function from eq .  .",
    "in the most general case , it is an arbitrary function of @xmath21 . to determine the average green s function @xmath68 in real space",
    ", one has to perform an inverse fourier transform .",
    "this is not always possible analytically and does not always lead to a simple effective medium ; @xmath4 is said to be non - local .",
    "we will not discuss these issues in the present paper .",
    "instead , we make a further approximation referred to as the on - shell approximation .",
    "it usually requires @xmath69 to be sufficiently smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath71 is weak enough , we can reasonably assume that the effect it will have on the homogeneous wavenumber @xmath72 is small , so that when performing the inverse three - dimensional fourier transform , the volume that essentially contributes to @xmath73 is the vicinity of the shell defined by @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , this amounts to performing a zero - order development of the self - energy around @xmath72 , hence replacing @xmath71 by @xmath75 in eq .  .",
    "in that case the expression of the average green s function in real space is straightforward : @xmath76 this means that the average green s function is that of a fictitious homogeneous absorbing medium with a complex - valued wavenumber @xmath77 such that @xmath78    equation   is a dispersion relation from which phase and group velocities for the coherent field can be determined .",
    "most importantly , the intensity of the coherent wave is found to decay exponentially with the distance ( beer - lambert s law ) .",
    "since there is no absorption , the losses are entirely due to scattering and the scattering mean - free path is @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "@xmath80 is an essential parameter in all multiple scattering problems .",
    "particularly , the range of validity of the bourret approximation can be shown to be @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that , as a refinement of the on - shell approximation , @xmath77 can be determined more accurately with an iterative algorithm using @xmath82 as a first guess .",
    "so , within the bourret approximation , as long as the correlation function for the potential @xmath25 is known , the effective wave speed and scattering mean - free path can be determined quite easily and sometimes analytically .",
    "a typical example is that of a disordered random medium with an exponentially decaying correlation function @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 denotes the variance of @xmath25 and @xmath85 its correlation length . in that case , under the bourret approximation",
    "the self - energy is : @xmath86 the on - shell approximation yields @xmath87 whose imaginary part determines the scattering mean - free path .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath88 , a first - order development of the square - root gives a simple analytic expression for the scattering mean - free path @xmath0 as a function of frequency , correlation length and variance of the potential : @xmath89 allowing us to work with practical dimensionless quantities and express @xmath90 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "beyond this simple example , whatever the shape of the correlation function and whatever the nature of the wave ( acoustic , electromagnetic ,  ) , the same formalism will hold as soon as we deal with a wavefield propagating in a heterogeneous medium in which heterogeneity is fully described by a scalar function such as @xmath25 .",
    "such is the case when the local wavespeed @xmath5 suffices to capture the heterogeneity , which is usually assumed as a starting point in multiple scattering theories .",
    "however this description of heterogeneity may sometimes be completely misleading , even in very simple situations .",
    "let us consider the case of acoustic waves in a lossless fluid .",
    "the medium is characterized by its mass density @xmath92 and compressibility @xmath93 at rest . with no sources , the linearized equations of elastodynamics",
    "read @xmath94 @xmath95 is the displacement undergone by the particle initially at rest at point @xmath35 , @xmath96 is the particle velocity , and @xmath97 is the acoustic pressure .",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are first - order infinitesimal quantities . to establish eqs .   and   all second - order non - linear terms have been neglected whatever their physical origin ( convective or thermodynamic ) . from a physical point of view , eqs .   and   are an expression of newton s second law and hooke s law ( the relative dilation @xmath101 undergone by an infinitesimal volume of fluid is proportional and opposed to the acoustic pressure ) .",
    "if neither @xmath92 nor @xmath93 depend on space coordinate @xmath35 , then eqs .   and   lead to the usual wave equation with a constant sound velocity @xmath102 , which applies to all quantities describing the sound wave ( acoustic pressure , velocity , displacement , dilation , etc  ) .    in a heterogeneous fluid , the local sound velocity naturally depends on the space coordinate @xmath35 as @xmath103 .",
    "it is therefore tempting to replace @xmath104 by @xmath5 in helmholtz equation for a homogeneous fluid ( eq .  ) , but this is not always correct .    combining eqs .   and   yields the following equations for the acoustic pressure and velocity : @xmath105    if @xmath92 does not vary in space , eq .   yields the usual wave equation for the acoustic pressure @xmath100 , with a space - dependent velocity @xmath106 .",
    "and if @xmath93 does not vary in space , eq .",
    "yields the usual wave equation for the velocity @xmath99 .",
    "but in the general case where _ both _ @xmath92 and @xmath93 vary with @xmath35 , none of the acoustic variables satisfy the usual wave equation  @xcite .",
    "however the resulting equation for the acoustic pressure ( eq .  ) can be fourier - transformed over time , then rearranged in order to define a potential , as we did before .",

    "@xmath111 is an arbitrary constant with the dimensions of a mass density .",

    "in addition , there is an other term , which unlike @xmath25 is not a simple scalar but an _ operator _ acting on the field it is applied to .",
    "it should be noticed that the same problem arises for different kinds of waves e.g. , electromagnetic waves propagating in a heterogeneous medium showing fluctuations of both relative permeability @xmath112 and permittivity @xmath113 . in that case ,",
    "maxwell s equations yield the following wave equation for the monochromatic electric field @xmath114 , with a potential that contains an operator part  : @xmath115\\times{\\vec{\\nabla}}\\times\\vec{e } = \\vec{0}.\\ ] ]    note that the real issue is not to determine when fluctuations in permeability ( or density , in the acoustic case ) can be neglected compared to fluctuations in permittivity ( resp .",
    "compressibility ) : both kinds of fluctuations , whether separated or combined , will result in a space - dependent wave speed @xmath5",
    ". the question should rather be set in terms of comparing the operator part and the scalar part in the potential describing the heterogeneity .    whatever the physical nature of the wave , the applicability of the diagrammatic techniques when the relevant potential @xmath108 has both a scalar part and an operator part as well as the impact of the operator part on the final result are not trivial . in the next section",
    ", we deal with this problem and obtain the average green s function , in the case of acoustic waves .",
    "in this section , the acoustic pressure @xmath116 is chosen as the relevant variable for the wavefield .",
    "the issue is to determine the average green s function of eq .  .",
    "the reference velocity is still chosen according to eq .  .",
    "since the medium is assumed to be statistically invariant under translation @xmath117 does not depend on the space coordinate @xmath35 . hence , despite the presence of @xmath118 , the average value of the potential @xmath108 will still be zero , since @xmath119 as usual , the green s function for eq .   can be written as a lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath120 @xmath108 is not a simple scalar function , which precludes the usual definition of its autocorrelation function and that of the self - energy .",
    "to overcome this difficulty , we start by introducing a two - variable potential @xmath121 such that @xmath122    eq .   becomes @xmath123 the next steps are as usual to develop eq .   into a born expansion by iteration , then to take its statistical average and write it under a recursive form ( dyson s equation ) . under the bourret approximation , only the first two terms in the self - energy",
