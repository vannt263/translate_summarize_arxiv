    "the response of macromolecules with linear chemical architecture to mechanical forces pulling at their ends has been a longstanding problem in the statistical mechanics of polymers  @xcite .",

    "but also insight into the structure - property relationships of synthetic polymers , e.g. bottle brushes  @xcite , has been gained by such experiments . however , despite extensive work on these problems , important aspects are still not well understood , even for the relatively simple case of macromolecules in dilute solutions of good solvent quality , disregarding the interesting interplay of chain stretching and collapse that occurs in poor solvents  @xcite , and also the interplay of chain stretching and adsorption on substrates  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of these problems is local chain stiffness .",

    "\\{table  [ table2 ] } , only data for rather flexible chains ( such as @xmath393 , for which @xmath394 ) deviate strongly from the k - p model , as expected . the simple langevin function \\{eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) } does not describe the behavior of these lattice chains with discrete bond angles .",
    "note that these chains are too short to show a well - developed pincus blob regime yet .",
    "for @xmath395 systematic deviations from the k - p prediction occur , which we attribute to effects due to the discreteness of bonds and bond angles in our model . only for very long chains ( such as @xmath396 and @xmath397 )",
    "do we find more pronounced deviations from the k - p prediction also for small relative extensions , @xmath398 .    for long chains , however",
    ", we do expect to see excluded volume effects ( manifested in pincus blobs ) , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii . thus fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] presents our data in suitably scaled form , considering the crossover from the linear response regime to the pincus blob regime , both for flexible chains ( a ) and semiflexible ones ( b ) , as well as the crossover from pincus blobs to kratky porod behavior ( c ) , and we show a close - up of the kratky - porod regime for very long and at the same time rather stiff chains ( d ) .",
    "of course , even with chain lengths up to @xmath397 it is not yet possible to clearly resolve all the different power laws shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) : in order to be able to distinguish the various crossovers clearly from each other , we would need very stiff chains ( @xmath3 should then be in the range @xmath399 ) , and then one would need to have chain lengths of many millions in order to have a well - developed pincus - blob regime .",
    "thus , we can verify the pincus blob regime only for rather flexible chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig16](a ) ) , for which then a well - developed kratky - porod regime is absent . for the stiff chains , we can see some tendency of the data to deviate from the k - p regime in the direction towards the pincus blob regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig16](b)(c ) ) , but the latter is not fully reached because the crossover to the linear response takes over ( fig .",
    "[ fig16](b ) ) . and",
    "when we study very stiff chains , we find deviations from the k - p model for rather small @xmath210 already , due to the discrete character of our chains .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows again data for the normalized fluctuations of the chain linear - dimensions , and fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] presents a counterpart to fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , showing a log - log plot of the local fluctuation @xmath374 versus @xmath284 .",
    "while the latter ( for large @xmath22 ) show again a simple crossover from the constant @xmath400 describing @xmath374 for small forces to a power law @xmath401 for @xmath402 , as in @xmath1 dimensions , the behavior of the fluctuations in the chain linear dimensions clearly is rather complicated .",
    "of course , there is a need to extend the scaling analysis , that was presented for @xmath14 as a function of @xmath284 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) to the fluctuations @xmath403 and @xmath404 in greater detail than we have done so far .",
    "we expect that analyzing these fluctuations should yield additional and valuable information on the structure of stretched semiflexible chains , and allow to pin down the parameters needed to relate experimental data to theoretical models more precisely .",
    "we plan to tackle this task in a forthcoming study .",
    "in this paper , we have studied self - avoiding walks on square and simple cubic lattices , where an energy penalty @xmath2 associated with chain bending to model semiflexibility of the polymer chains , by extensive monte carlo simulations , using the perm algorithm .",
    "we have obtained both force versus extension curves and chain linear dimensions in the absence of forces for a wide range of chain lengths @xmath24 ( typically @xmath24 up to @xmath397 ) and chain stiffness ( characterized by @xmath405 ) . in sec .",
    "ii , we have attempted to present a coherent phenomenological theoretical description , combining results from scaling concepts with other results derived from the kratky - porod model , to explain the various crossovers that can occur in the force versus extension curves for various circumstances ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have emphasized that the case of @xmath1 dimensions is rather different from the case @xmath0 : only in the latter case one can identify a linear regime in the force versus extension curve that is compatible with the kratky - porod model ; the linear response regime both in @xmath1 and @xmath0 dimensions is strongly affected by the presence of excluded volume effects , and for long enough chains is followed by a nonlinear (  pincus blob \" ) regime for stronger forces both in @xmath1 and @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "however , for very stiff and not too long chains in @xmath0 the chains in the absence of a force show gaussian behavior , and in this case the stretched chains do not exhibit the nonlinear pincus blob regime , and the kratky - porod model holds throughout ( apart from very strong forces , where the discrete character of polymer chains matter ) .    the monte carlo data that we have generated do provide evidence for these concepts , particularly in the relatively simple case of @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "while in @xmath1 all expected regimes of the force vs. extension curves are confirmed and the expected scaling behavior is verified , problems remain concerning the precise understanding of longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of chain linear dimensions of the chains .",
    "more work on these aspects ( from theory , simulation , and experiment ) clearly is desirable .",
    "we recall that imaging techniques can provide rather detailed information on chain configurations of semiflexible polymers adsorbed on substrates ; we expect that our work should be useful to interpret such experiments .    in the case of @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "our numerical evidence is much more limited : chain lengths @xmath406 clearly do not suffice to fully resolve three distinct power laws ( separated by smooth crossovers ) in the force versus extension curves .",
    "however , simulations for chains that are one or two orders of magnitude larger clearly are not feasible at present .",
    "we do obtain evidence , however , that for rather stiff thin short chains excluded volume effects indeed are negligible , as expected , and hence the kratky - porod model holds .",
    "however , when chain stiffness is due to thickness ( persistence length @xmath3 being proportional to local chain diameter @xmath86 ) , the regime of gaussian statistics disappears and rather excluded volume effects dominate throughout , resulting in a rather broad regime where the force versus extension curve is nonlinear already for small @xmath210 .",
    "also for rather flexible chains , clear evidence for the pincus blob regime is obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig16](a ) ) .    in our modelling",
    ", we have approximated the interactions between monomers of the chain as a strictly local excluded volume interaction .",
    "of course , in many cases of interest the interactions are of longer range , e.g. because of electrostatic interactions between charged groups . particularly for polyelectrolytes the resulting problem of an",
    " electrostatic persistence length \" has received longstanding attention in the literature  @xcite .",
    "molecules such as dna and rna do possess a substantial linear charge density , and the properties of such polyelectrolytes , in fact , will depend on the electrostatic screening due to ions in the solution , and thus the effective persistence length will depend on ionic strength . in this context , the concept of an  effective thickness \" of polyelectrolytes , that are described in terms of a ",
    "thick chain model \"  @xcite , has been used to model experimental extension versus force curves .",
    "it will be an interesting task for the future , beyond the scope of the present paper , to clarify the extent to which such approaches are equivalent to the scaling concepts applied here . in any case",
    ", it is very reassuring that very recently , after our study was completed , single - molecule elasticity measurements of the onset of excluded volume effects of stretched poly(ethylene glycol ) were published  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the pincus blob scaling behavior ( @xmath407 in @xmath0 dimensions ) could be seen under several circumstances , followed by a crossover to the linear behavior @xmath408 and subsequent saturation , compatible with the behavior predicted by the k - p model .",
    "the interpretation given in ref .",
    "@xcite for these experiments is fully consistent with the description given in the present paper .",
    "some earlier evidence for the pincus behavior was also found for dna  @xcite .     in our simulations , we have not considered the effects of varying the diameter @xmath86 of our chains ( we have chosen @xmath409 , the lattice spacing , throughout ) . for biopolymers",
    "@xmath86 is a parameter of great interest as well  @xcite , of course . in our studies of bottlebrush polymers",
    "@xcite , however , we studied conditions for which @xmath410 , and then the k - p model was not useful even in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "thus we hope that the present work will contribute to the better understanding of both existing and future experiments . a very interesting aspect , completely beyond the scope of the present work , are dynamic properties of stretched semiflexible polymers in solution , see e.g. ref .",
    "our study should yield useful inputs for such problems , too .",
