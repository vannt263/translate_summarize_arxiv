    "the points of @xcite that are not covered by theorem  [ hav - nersess - opers ] is that there they do not need transversality and obtain a value of @xmath7 which is an explicit universal constant depending only on the number of disks .    in the next theorem",

    "if @xmath75 is an open set with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we say that @xmath1 satisfies the _ exterior disk condition with radius @xmath78 _ if for every @xmath79 there is @xmath80 such that the disk @xmath81 _ touches @xmath1 at @xmath82 _ ; that is @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    in order to simplify the geometrical arguments",

    "if @xmath9 is piecewise @xmath97 and the exterior angles at its corners are nonzero , then @xmath1 clearly satisfies condition  [ conda ] .",
    "moreover , it is possible to prove that if @xmath9 is a finite disjoint union of jordan curves and @xmath1 satisfies the exterior disk condition and an interior cone condition , then @xmath1 also satisfies condition  [ conda ] . in particular , the exterior disk condition is formally weaker than condition  [ conda ] .",
    "[ putinar - sandb - non - conv ] let @xmath2 be a bounded linear operator and @xmath98 an open set whose boundary is a finite disjoint union of jordan curves .",
    "assume that @xmath76 , that @xmath1 satisfies condition  [ conda ] and that @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , assume that for every @xmath100 and every @xmath101 we have @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath103 is a complete @xmath7-spectral set for some @xmath104 .",
    "it is easy to see that the hypotheses are satisfied ( for any @xmath105 ) if @xmath1 is a convex jordan domain and the numerical range of @xmath2 is contained in @xmath103 .",
    "this case was first proved by delyon and delyon[delyondelyon ] in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ putinar - sandb - non - conv ] will be deduced from the delyon - delyon result and from theorem  [ hav - nersess - opers ] .",
    "putinar and sandberg gave a different proof of the delyon - delyon result in @xcite by constructing a so called normal skew - dilation .",
    "these articles consider only @xmath7-spectral sets instead of complete @xmath7-spectral sets .",
    "however , the arguments used both in @xcite and @xcite imply the existence of a normal operator @xmath23 on a larger hilbert space @xmath106 and having @xmath107 , and a bounded linear map @xmath108 such that @xmath109    it follows from lemma  [ lemma - cb ] below that the map @xmath110 is completely bounded ( see also crouzeix  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , implies that @xmath3 is a complete @xmath7-spectral set for @xmath2 , and so that under the assumptions of the delyon - delyon theorem , @xmath2 is similar to an operator having a normal dilation to @xmath9 .",
    "it is also known that theorem  [ putinar - sandb - non - conv ] is valid if @xmath1 is the unit disk .",
    "in fact , by results of sz .- nagy and foias , if the hypotheses hold in this case , then @xmath2 is a @xmath111-contraction for some @xmath112 and hence is similar to a contraction",
    ". therefore theorem  [ putinar - sandb - non - conv ] can be considered as a generalization of both of the above mentioned results .",
    "we refer to section  [ proofs12 ] for a further discussion and some consequences of this result .",
    "we will deduce the first part of theorem  [ hav - nersess - opers ] from results of havin , nersessian and cerd , where they give various geometric conditions on domains @xmath113 in @xmath12 , guaranteeing that every function @xmath114 in @xmath115 admits a representation @xmath116 in other words , the domains @xmath113 admit a _ separation of singularities_.    the proof of the second part of theorem  [ hav - nersess - opers ] will also use lemma  [ lemma - cb ] .",
    "this lemma says , basically , that if the range of a bounded linear map is commutative , then the map is automatically completely bounded .",
    "the particular maps we will be considering have commutative ranges , so this lemma will be important in our proofs .",
    "the arguments by havin , nersessian and cerd will also be key here , because they allow us to deal with commutative algebras of functions ( to which lemma  [ lemma - cb ] can be applied ) instead of noncommutative algebras of operators .",
    "suppose now that @xmath0 is a collection of functions mapping into @xmath117 , such that each of them is analytic on ( its own ) neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the article is devoted to finding sufficient conditions for complete @xmath7-spectrality of the form @xmath118 here @xmath119 stands for the open unit disk .",
    "notice that for any @xmath120 , @xmath5 is defined by the cauchy - riesz functional calculus .",
    "our conditions concern the set @xmath1 and the family @xmath0 , but we do not impose extra conditions on @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , a special case of is that @xmath121 in this case , @xmath0 will be called a test collection ( a more precise definition of this notion will be given in the next section ) .",
    "as we will show , many known sufficient conditions for complete @xmath7-spectrality are easily formulated in the form or in the form for specific test collections .",
    "indeed , theorems  [ hav - nersess - opers ] and  [ putinar - sandb - non - conv ] can also be given this form if one uses appropriate riemann mappings for the test functions ( see section  [ sec : known - criteria ] below ) .",
    "as we will show , implication holds when we can solve the following :    [ prob : alg - gen - prob ] suppose @xmath0 is a finite family of functions in @xmath122 , the algebra of functions in @xmath123 that are analytic on the interior of @xmath124 .",
    "find geometric conditions guaranteeing that @xmath0 generates @xmath122 as an algebra .",
    "a solution to this was given in our previous article @xcite ( which also was inspired by the techniques of havin , nersessian and cerd  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we more generally prove that sometimes it is sufficient to show that the closed subalgebra of @xmath125 generated by @xmath0 is of finite codimension .",
    "the article is organized in the following manner . in section  [ main - results ] , we introduce admissible test functions and we state the main results of this article concerning test collections . in section  [ sec : known - criteria ] , we interpret known criteria of complete @xmath7-spectrality in terms of test collections . section  [ proofs12 ] contains the proofs of theorems [ hav - nersess - opers ] and [ putinar - sandb - non - conv ] , which were stated in the introduction . in section  [ sec : article1 ] , we will list the results of @xcite that we will need to prove our theorems .",
    "section  [ lemmas ] is devoted to the the auxiliary lemmas that are needed to prove the main results .",
    "section  [ proofs - main ] contains the proofs of the main theorems .",
    "finally , in section  [ weakly - admissible ] , we treat weakly admissible test functions , a larger class of test functions for which we can also prove some results ( see , in particular , theorem  [ weak - main ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath126 the @xmath127-algebra of complex @xmath128 matrices .",
    "if @xmath129 is a ( not necessarily closed ) linear subspace of a @xmath127-algebra @xmath130 , we denote by @xmath131 the tensor product equipped with the norm inherited from @xmath132 , which has a unique @xmath127 norm .",
    "one can view @xmath131 as the space of @xmath128 matrices with entries in @xmath129 . the simplest way to norm",
    "this is to represent @xmath130 faithfully as a subspace of @xmath21 and to then take the natural norm of @xmath128 operator matrices .",
    "if @xmath133 is another @xmath127-algebra and @xmath134 is a linear map , we can form the map @xmath135 , which amounts to applying @xmath136 entrywise to @xmath17 matrices over @xmath129 .",
    "the completely bounded norm of @xmath136 is then defined as @xmath137    if a compact set @xmath138 is a complete @xmath7-spectral set for a bounded linear operator @xmath2 and @xmath139 , the algebra of rational functions with poles off of @xmath140 , is dense in @xmath141 , then the functional calculus for @xmath2 extends continuously to @xmath142 , and we say that such a @xmath2 admits a continuous @xmath141-calculus .",
    "note that there are various sorts of geometric conditions on @xmath140 guaranteeing that @xmath139 is dense in @xmath141 ( see , for instance , @xcite*chapter v , theorem 19.2 for one such ) .",
    "in particular , it suffices for @xmath140 to be finitely connected ( see @xcite*chapter v , corollary 19.3 ) . in what follows ,",

    "@xmath150-pole size _ of @xmath2 by @xmath152 . in the setting of this article",

    ".   _ non - uniform strong test collection over @xmath1 _ if holds , where @xmath7 depends on @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , as well as @xmath2 .",
    "to summarize , there is the basic notion of a _ test collection _ , which roughly means that whenever @xmath154 is a contraction for every @xmath136 in the collection , then @xmath2 has @xmath3 as a @xmath7-spectral set . to this",
    ", one can add the adjectives _ uniform _ , _ quasi - uniform _ and _ non - uniform _ , which mean respectively that @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath2 , that @xmath7 depends only on @xmath152 , and that that @xmath7 may depend on @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the term _ strong _ indicates that we can replace the condition @xmath155 by the weaker condition that @xmath156 is a complete @xmath4-spectral set for @xmath5 for all @xmath157 .",
    "an operator @xmath78 has @xmath156 as a complete @xmath158-spectral set if and only if @xmath78 is a contraction . in this case , @xmath78 has @xmath156 as a complete @xmath4-spectral set for all @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , each strong test collection is a test collection .",
    "also note that when @xmath160 consists of a single element , the _ strong _",
    "part comes for free , since if @xmath5 has @xmath156 as a complete @xmath7-spectral set for some @xmath7 , then there is some invertible operator @xmath129 such that @xmath161 is a contraction , and so we can reason with @xmath162 instead of @xmath2 .    in most cases , @xmath1 will be an open domain or the closure of an open domain .",
    "given a domain @xmath11 , the notions of a test collection over @xmath11 and over @xmath15 might seem very similar , but as we will see below , the condition that @xmath68 , as opposed to the stronger condition @xmath163 , represents an additional technical challenge in some arguments .",
    "finally , the notion of a non - uniform test collection over an open set @xmath1 is trivial , since if @xmath163 , then @xmath3 is a complete @xmath7-spectral set for @xmath2 , where @xmath7 depends on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this was first proved for @xmath164 by rota  @xcite , and follows in general from the herrero - voiculescu theorem ( see @xcite*theorem 9.13 ) .",
