    "<S> gas and dust in star - forming galaxies at the peak epoch of galaxy assembly are presently the topic of intense study , but little is known about the interstellar medium ( ism ) of distant , passively evolving galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we report on a deep 3mm - band search with iram / pdbi for molecular ( h@xmath0 ) gas in a massive ( @xmath1@xmath26@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 ) elliptical galaxy at @xmath6=1.4277 , the first observation of this kind ever attempted . </S>",
    "<S> we place a 3@xmath7 upper limit of 0.32jykm / s on the flux of the co(@xmath8=2@xmath91 ) line or @xmath10@xmath118.8@xmath310@xmath12kkm / spc@xmath13 , assuming a disk - like co - morphology and a circular velocity scaling with the stellar velocity dispersion as in local early - type galaxies ( etgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this translates to an h@xmath0 mass of @xmath113.9@xmath310@xmath14(@xmath15/4.4)@xmath5 or a gas fraction of @xmath166% assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and an ism dominated by h@xmath0 , as observed in many local , high - mass ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> this low value approaches that of local etgs , suggesting that the low star formation activity in massive , high-@xmath6 passive galaxies reflects a true dearth of gas and a lesser role for inhibitive mechanisms like morphological quenching . </S>"
