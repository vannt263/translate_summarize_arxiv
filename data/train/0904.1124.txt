    "according to the conventional treatment of quantum mechanics , states of a system are associated either with the wave functions ( vectors in a hilbert space ) or with the density operators . apart from this",
    ", a new formulation of quantum states has been elaborated @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the last few decades .",
    "this representation associates the states with the standard probability distributions .",
    "in fact , these probability distributions can be measured directly in the experiment .",
    "all the physical ingredients of quantum mechanics like means of observables , their dispersions , etc . can be expressed in terms of the probability distributions of the corresponding quantum states . as far as continuous variables are concerned ,",
    "the experiments to reconstruct the wigner function of photon states were performed , for example in @xcite .",
    "we point out that in the approach @xcite the primary object in quantum mechanics associated to the quantum states is namely the probability distribution .",
    "once the distribution is measured , it is not necessary at all to make any intermediate steps ( like reconstruction of wigner function ) in order to extract the experimental information on the physical properties of a system .",
    "this implies that the quantum properties such as means of observables , variances , and other statistical characteristics can be directly obtained in view of the probability distributions .",
    "this aspect of the probability - representation approach takes place also for the states with discrete variables like spins , qubits , qudits , etc .",
    "we concentrate here on the problem of probability representation for spin states .",
    "the quasidistribution functions for discrete spin - variable states were discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the quasidistributions such as analogs of the wigner function @xcite or the husimi function @xcite for lie groups , including @xmath2 group , determine the corresponding states .",
    "in the same spirit , there exists the possibility to use fair probability distributions for spin degrees of freedom and , in fact , for other lie groups ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "any spin state can be equivalently described by the density operator @xmath3 or by the fair probability - distribution function called spin tomogram @xcite ( for states with continuous variables see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the probability - distribution function is usually considered as an intermediate procedure for the density operator reconstruction . apart from being a useful experimental tool ,",
    "quantum tomograms themselves are a primary notion of quantum states . using tomograms , one deals with functions instead of density operators .",
    "various properties of these functions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "similarly to the density operator , any other operator can be identified with a function called tomographic symbol of the operator . unlike the tomogram",
    ", this function is not nonnegative in the general case . to describe the standard product of operators on a hilbert space",
    ", one can introduce the star - product of the tomographic symbols @xcite .",
    "the star - product is associative but noncommutative in general .",
    "operators and , in particular , observables can also be associated with functions called dual tomographic symbols @xcite ( the first step toward dual symbols is taken in @xcite ; dual symbols are applied to study the quantumness of qubits in @xcite ) .",
    "ordinary and dual tomographic symbols linked together enable one to calculate expectation values of observables .",
    "hence it is possible to treat states , operators , and related quantities within the framework of the unified tomographic representation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reconsider quantizer and dequantizer operators for spin tomograms of qudit states .",
    "these operators relate tomograms with density operators , and observables with ordinary and dual tomographic symbols as well .",
    "moreover , quantizer and dequantizer operators are constituent parts of the kernel of star - product , which is widely used while dealing with maps of spin operators onto functions .",
    "the general procedure to use quantizer and dequantizer operators was discussed in the context of star - product quantization schemes in @xcite .",
    "although the explicit formulas for quantizer and dequantizer operators were obtained earlier , here we introduce another relatively simple form of these operators , show simple relations between them , check the equivalency of approaches applied in different works , and consider cases of qubits and qutrits in detail .",
    "we also focus attention on the star - product kernel for ordinary and dual tomographic symbols .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ ala : castanos ] , we use the irreducible tensor - operator technique to get the simple form of quantizer and dequantizer operators . in sec .",
    "[ section : xexponenta ] , the exponential representation of quantizer and dequantizer operators is reconsidered in order to illustrate its equivalency to other approaches . in sec .",
    "[ section : delta ] , we derive the kernel of the unity operator on the set of qubit tomograms and that of on the set of qutrit tomograms . in sec . [",
    "section : starproduct ] , the explicit forms of the star - product kernel for qubits and qutrits are obtained . in sec .",
    "[ section : dual : symbols ] , dual tomographic symbols are briefly discussed . in sec .",
    "[ section : conclusions ] , conclusions are presented .",
    "unless specifically stated , qudit states with spin @xmath4 are considered .",
    "we start with state vectors @xmath5 and the standard basis of the angular momentum operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 defined through    @xmath9 is the spin projection ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the spin tomogram of a qudit state given by its density operator @xmath3 reads    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a @xmath13 unitary matrix of irreducible representation of the rotation group @xmath2 and @xmath14 denotes the set of parameters @xmath15 , with the euler angles @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 defining the matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the tomogram satisfies the following normalization conditions :    @xmath19    we introduced the dequantizer operator in ( [ tomogram ] ) as    @xmath20    which is nothing else but the spin-@xmath4 projector operator onto the @xmath21 component along the @xmath22 axis rotated by an element @xmath12 of @xmath2 .",
    "given the tomogram @xmath23 , one can reconstruct the density operator @xmath3 using the quantizer operator @xmath24 as follows    @xmath25    where    @xmath26    following @xcite we write the explicit formulas for both dequantizer and quantizer operators in terms of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath27 :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the wigner @xmath30-function of the form    @xmath31    and @xmath32 is the irreducible tensor operator for the @xmath2 group ( also known as the polarization operator @xcite )    @xmath33    it is worth noting that the clebsch - gordan coefficients can always be chosen real .",
    "consequently , the operator @xmath32 is real in the basis of states @xmath5 .    from formula ( [ dequantizer : simple ] )",
    "it follows that , if the operator @xmath34 is known , the dequantizer can easily be calculated .",
    "so we focus on finding a simple formula of this operator .    since @xmath35 , it follows from ( [ dequantizer : complex ] ) that    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a function of the spin projection @xmath21 and the operator @xmath38 is proportional to the operator @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , @xmath40 is real and diagonal ( and hence hermitian ) because of peculiar form of the operator @xmath39    @xmath41    moreover , the operators @xmath40 and @xmath42 are orthogonal in the sense of trace operation    @xmath43    this implies that any hermitian operator , being diagonal in the basis of states @xmath5 , can be resolved to the linear sum of operators @xmath38 , @xmath44 . in other words ,",
    "matrices @xmath40 form a basis in the space of diagonal hermitian matrices . on the other hand ,",
    "the operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 are also suitable to form the basis in the same space of operators .",
    "the transition from one basis to the other can be clarified by applying the operator @xmath47 which swaps states @xmath5 and @xmath48 . combining ( [ tl0 ] ) with such a rule , one obtains @xmath49 .",
    "it is also obvious that @xmath50 .",
    "hence , if the number @xmath51 is odd , the operator @xmath38 resolves to the sum of @xmath8 to odd powers , and similarly , if the number @xmath51 is even , the operator @xmath38 resolves to the sum of @xmath8 to even powers . since @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we may assume that the power of operators @xmath8 in the expansion of @xmath38 is not greater than @xmath51 .",
    "these results can be summarized as follows :    @xmath54    or in the matrix form    @xmath55    from ( [ s : through : j::matrix ] ) it follows that @xmath56 , by construction .",
    "the explicit form of coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be found readily by employing the orthogonality property ( [ s : s : orthogonality ] ) .",
    "in fact , since the number of expansion terms in ( [ s : even : through : j ] ) increases step - by - step with increase of @xmath51 , any operator @xmath59 must be orthogonal in the sense of trace operation to each @xmath60 , @xmath61 . if we combine this requirement with expansion ( [ s : even : through : j ] ) , we get the following system of equations :    @xmath62    it can be proved that the determinant @xmath63 of square matrix in the left side of ( [ a : coefficients::system ] ) is never equal to zero .",
    "this implies that one can calculate the coefficients involved using the cramer s rule @xcite .",
    "indeed , let @xmath64 be equal to @xmath65 ; then the coefficients read    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the @xmath68th column of matrix ( [ a : coefficients::system ] ) by the column vector @xmath69 .",
    "arguing as above , we obtain    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    and @xmath72 is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the @xmath68th column of matrix ( [ matrix : trj::for : odd : b ] ) by the column vector @xmath73 .",
    "though the explicit expressions for the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 seem rather complicated , they can be readily computed by recalling that the spin projection @xmath21 can take discrete values only .",
    "this results in the value of @xmath74 being expressed by means of the corresponding bernoulli numbers @xcite .",
    "using formulas obtained , one can easily write the explicit form of operators @xmath38 in the case of small numbers @xmath51 ( within a constant factor )    @xmath75    now we show how to calculate functions @xmath37 which are coefficients of expansion ( [ jm : jm ] ) . using the orthogonality property ( [ s : s : orthogonality ] ) , we obtain    @xmath76    on the other hand ,    @xmath77    combining ( [ s : even : through : j ] ) , ( [ s : odd : through : j ] ) , ( [ f : m::first ] ) , and ( [ f : m::second ] ) , we obtain    @xmath78^{-1 } \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^{n } a_{2k}^{(j , l ) } m^{2k } \\qquad { \\rm if } \\qquad l=2n , \\\\ \\label{f : m : odd } & f_{l}^{(j)}(m ) = \\left [ { \\rm tr } \\left ( \\left .",
