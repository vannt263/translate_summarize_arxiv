    "molecular motors , or motor proteins , play important role in the functioning of biological systems @xcite .",
    "they transform a chemical energy into mechanical work with a high efficiency and move along linear molecular tracks .",
    "conventional molecular motors fuel their motion by hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) or related compounds , and the chemical energy influx creates a biased directed motion along one - dimensional protein filaments . during the translocation of motor proteins the chemical state of linear protein tracks remains unchanged .",
    "recently , a new type of molecular motor , independent of atp hydrolysis , has been discovered @xcite . a special protein called collagenase moves along collagen fibrils , which are the main component of extracellular matrix @xcite , and it cleaves the filament at special sites .",
    "collagen proteolysis provides a chemical energy that produces a directed motion of the motor protein molecule .",
    "it was found that the random motion of enzyme molecule can be transformed into the biased diffusion along the linear track if , after the cleavage of collagen , the motor protein could only move on one side of the broken link @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the dynamics of collagenases can be explained by a so called `` burnt - bridge '' model ( bbm ) @xcite . according to this approach , the motor protein",
    "is viewed as a random walker hopping along the one - dimensional lattice that consists of two types of links : strong and weak .",
    "strong links are not affected when the particle passes them , however crossing the weak links might destroy them with a probability @xmath3 , and the random walker is not allowed to move again over the `` burnt '' links . using a spatial continuum approximation , that neglects the underlying lattice ,",
    "the burnt - bridge model has been discussed in the limiting cases of very low @xmath0 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this approximation is only valid in the limit of very low concentrations of the special links , although in biological systems the density of bridges might be significant @xcite .",
    "antal and krapivsky @xcite have investigated bbm by using a discrete - time random walk approach that allowed to calculate exactly velocities and dispersions for some sets of parameters for several versions of the model . however , discrete - time dynamics is unrealistic for motor proteins since their dynamics is tightly coupled to a set of chemical transitions @xcite , and time intervals between these transitions are distributed exponentially according to poisson statistics .",
    "a discrete - time statistics implicitly assumes a delta - function waiting time distribution between consecutive steps .",
    "in addition , the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is mathematically very involved , and not all relevant dynamic properties have been computed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate more realistic continuous - time discrete - state stochastic burnt - bridge models using simple analytical approaches and extensive monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "let us consider a single random walker that moves along an infinite one - dimensional lattice as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the particle can hop in both directions with the same rate @xmath5 , i.e. , initially there is no bias in the motion of the random walker .",
    "we set the size of the lattice spacing to be equal to one .",
    "there are two types of links between consecutive binding sites on the lattice",
    ". the random walker does not interact with the strong links , while crossing the weak link leads to burning of the bridge with the probability @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that after the burning of the bridge the particle is always on the right side from it , and there are no burnt bridges at the initial time .",
    "thus the particle is never trapped between broken links , and it moves continuously forward .",
    "we distinguish two different possibilities of burning the bridge . in the first option ,",
    "the bridge is burned only when the particle crosses it from left to right , but nothing happens when the walker moves from right to left .",
    "this model is called a forward bbm . in the second option",
    ", the particle burns the bridge on any forward and backward motion across the weak link , describing a forward - backward bbm .",
    "it is important to note that both cases are identical for @xmath1 , while for @xmath2 dynamics differs significantly for different burning scenarios .",
    "dynamic properties of the system also depend on the details the particle behavior near the already burned bridge @xcite . in the standard version of bbm",
    "the particle sitting next the broken link can only move forward to the right direction . in the modified version of bbm the walker tries to cross the burnt bridge , but",
    "the attempt fails and the particle does not change its position .",
    "the dynamics of the motor protein molecule in different bbms is directly determined by two parameters : the probability of burning @xmath0 and the concentration of weak links @xmath6 .",
    "the distribution of bridges strongly influences the dynamic properties @xcite , and we will consider two different cases : periodic and random distributions .",
    "the case when the bridges are found at equal distance @xmath7 lattice spacings apart from each other describes the periodic distribution , while in the random case we postulate that each link is a bridge with the probability @xmath6 every time the walker visits it .",
    "note , however , that other realizations of the random distribution of bridges are also possible .",
    "first , we consider a special case of bbm with @xmath1 when any crossing of the bridge leads to its burning .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the first burnt bridge was crossed from the left .",
    "thus the particle drifts to the right ( forward ) direction . for the periodic distribution of bridges",
    "the dynamic properties of the system can be evaluated explicitly by mapping the model into the motion of the random walker on infinite one - dimensional periodic lattice , for which exact solutions have been derived by derrida in 1983 @xcite .",
    "the particle at site @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) moves forward ( backward ) with the rate @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and the periodicity requires that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the size of the period . for this model",

    "it is interesting to consider their behavior in limiting cases . when every link on the lattice is a bridge ( @xmath24 ) we obtain @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as expected .",
    "more interesting is the limit of @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity goes to zero , @xmath28 , as expected , and this reproduces the result of the continuum theory of mai et al .",
    "but , surprisingly , it is found that @xmath29 and it is not equal to the dispersion of a free particle on the lattice without bridges , @xmath30 .",
    "this jump in the dispersion might correspond to a dynamic transition , indicating qualitatively different behavior of the particle moving in the system without weak links and particle diffusing in bbm .",
    "similar behavior has been observed in the discrete - time bbm @xcite .",
    "however , this interesting phenomenon requires a more careful and detailed investigation .",
    "the mapping of bbm to the particle hopping model on the periodic lattice can also be used to investigate discrete - time burnt - bridge models .",
    "it was found @xcite that in this case the explicit expression for the velocity is the same as in the continuous case , while for the diffusion coefficient it can be shown that @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath15 can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ vel ] ) and ( [ d ] ) . however , the rate constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 have to be reinterpreted as jumping probabilities , leading to @xmath33 at the same time , for the particle near the burned bridge the rates are @xmath34 and @xmath21 for the standard bbm , while @xmath35 and @xmath21 for the modified bbm . then the dynamic properties of the standard discrete - time bbm are @xmath36 and for the modified bbm we obtain @xmath37 these results fully agree with those obtained in ref .",

    "specifically , the mean velocity of the particle is given by @xmath70 however , since the rates to go forward and backward are the same at all sites except the origin , all contributions to the velocity cancel out and only @xmath71 term survives , @xmath72 for @xmath1 this equation reduces to @xmath73 , which agrees exactly with the result ( [ vv ] ) derived using the mapping to derrida s random hopping model . in the limit of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) eq .",

    "the expression for the velocity ( [ lambda ] ) also simplifies in the case of @xmath79 , giving @xmath80 .",

    ", each link can be a bridge with the probability @xmath6 every time the particle visits it , and the link can also burn with the probability @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that bbm with random distribution of bridges is equivalent to bbm with periodic distribution for @xmath129 and with the probability of burning equal to @xmath130 .",
    "then all dynamic properties can be calculated as explained above by modifying already derived results with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "for example , the velocity of the particle in the continuous - time forward bbm with random distribution of bridges is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) as @xmath133 also for the random distribution of bridges in the continuous - time forward - backward model the calculations based on the method outlined above produce the following expression , @xmath134 in the limit of @xmath135 and @xmath136 it reduces to @xmath137 , which is in exact agreement with the result obtained for this case in the ref .",
    "it should be noted again , that there are different possibilities of introducing randomness in the distribution of bridges that differ from our presentation , and that could effect the dynamic properties of the system .",
    "however , our theoretical approach can be applied for these cases too .",
    "to check the validity of our theoretical approach we performed extensive monte carlo computer simulations for several bbms . a general algorithm for continuous - time and discrete - time random walks , discussed in detail in ref",

    "the results of simulations , as shown in figs .",

    "theoretical calculations show that the velocity of the particle in bbm is a monotonously increasing function of the concentration of weak links and burning probability : see figs . 2 , 4 and 5 . however , the behavior of the dispersion is more complex , as can be judged from figs . 2 and 6 .",
    "for fixed values of @xmath0 it decreases as a function of @xmath6 , although note large fluctuations when @xmath27 .",
    "increase in the burning probability first lowers significantly the dispersion , and then it starts to increase slowly .",
    "our computer simulations indicate ( see fig .",
    "6a ) that when every link in the system is a potential bridge ( @xmath24 ) the dispersion is always equal to 1/2 for any @xmath143 .",
    "dynamic properties of the particle in bbm depend on the distribution of bridges , as illustrated in fig .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , at the same concentration @xmath6 and the burning probability @xmath0 , the random walker moves faster for the random and not for the periodic distribution of bridges , although the difference decreases for lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "this surprising observation can be explained using the following arguments .",
    "when burning of the bridge can take place with a significant probability , the rate - limiting step in the forward motion of the particle is to find the weak link . for the case of the random distribution , when any link can turn out to be a bridge with the probability @xmath6 , the time to find",
    "the bridge is of the order of @xmath144 . in the periodic distribution of bridges",
    "the particle has to diffuse a distance @xmath7 before reaching the bridge , and the diffusion time is of the order of @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the particle moves faster in the random distribution of bridges .",
    "our theoretical calculations also show that details of burning process ( forward versus forward - backward ) are affecting the dynamics of the particle . under the same conditions , the random walker moves faster in the forward - backward bbm , and this effect is significant for large @xmath0 and @xmath6 : see fig .",
    "these results are expected since the burning of the bridge fuels the forward motion of the particle .",
    "the possibility of burning in the forward and backward motion accelerates the motion of the random walker .",
