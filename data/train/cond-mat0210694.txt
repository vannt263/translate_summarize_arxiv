    "large populations and continuous fields of coupled oscillators form a representative class of synergetic systems met in a wide range of scientific disciplines from physics , chemistry , engineering , biology to brain science @xcite .",
    "collective dynamics of coupled oscillators depends crucially on the range of their mutual coupling .",
    "it has recently been realized that when the coupling is nonlocal , the patterns which emerge could be drastically different from those which we expect for oscillators with local or global coupling @xcite .",
    "the implication of this fact is relevant even to what we conventionally call locally coupled systems , typically reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "this is because it may happen that nonlocality can arise effectively as a result of elimination of some variables , e.g. , rapidly diffusing components in the case of reaction - diffusion dynamics . among",
    "the variety of patterns which are characteristic to nonlocally coupled oscillators , we will focus our attention below on a particular class of patterns in which the whole medium is separated into two domains of qualitatively different dynamics . specifically",
    ", the oscillators are mutually synchronized in one domain while they are completely desynchronized . in the other domain .",
    "a preliminary work on such dynamics was reported recently@xcite .",
    "we will present below a more thorough investigation of this problem .",
    "the collective dynamics of our concern is similar to the collective synchronization in globally coupled oscillators with distributed natural frequencies @xcite where the whole population splits into two subpopulations each composed of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators .",
    "there the systems is stationary in a statistical sense within a constant drift of the collective phase corresponding to the oscillation of the population as a whole .",
    "similarly to the case of global coupling , the individual oscillators can be regarded as being controlled by a common mean field , although the latter is now space dependent .",
    "the oscillators under consideration are identical in nature , still we may develop an exact mean - field theory similar to the one developed for globally coupled oscillators . commonly to these theories , a suitably defined order parameter representing the collective state is determined from a condition for self - consistency which must exist between the collective dynamics and the dynamics of the individual oscillators .    in section 2 , some results of our numerical simulation will be presented .",
    "the simulation is carried out first on a nonlocal version of the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation in one space dimension with periodic boundary conditions , and then on another equation obtained through the phase reduction of the nonlocal cgl . in section 3 , our theory will be developed and a functional self - consistency equation will be derived for the order parameter . then the numerical solution of the self - consistency equation will be compared with the simulation results presented in section 2 . concluding remarks will be given in the final section .",
    "as a simplest model for densely and uniformly distributed oscillators with nonlocal coupling , let us consider the following equation for a complex amplitude @xmath0 which we call nonlocally coupled complex ginzburg - landau equation@xcite .",
    "in one spatial dimension our model is expressed as @xmath1 the quantity @xmath2 , which we call the mean field , represents the effects of the nonlocal coupling and is given by @xmath3 the coupling function @xmath4 changes with the distance as @xmath5 and is normalized .",
    "the exponential form of @xmath4 is in fact a natural consequence of the reductive derivation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) from a certain class of reaction - diffusion systems when the latter involve an inactive diffusive component to be eliminated adiabatically@xcite .",
    "note that the last term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) representing the coupling is so arranged that it may vanish when @xmath0 is uniform in space .",
    "if @xmath0 is nonuniform but sufficiently long - waved , this term can be approximated with a diffusion term , and then eq .  ( 1 )",
    "is reduced to the ordinary cgl .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is numerically simulated on a finite interval @xmath6 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions . in a suitable range of parameters ,",
    "in which the uniform oscillation is linearly stable , the system can develop peculiar patterns when the initial perturbation is finite .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical example of such phase patterns .",
    "the initial condition is such that the modulus of @xmath0 equals 1 everywhere and its phase changing randomly still its envelope being nearly symmetric about the midpoint @xmath7 .",
    "since the coupling constant @xmath8 is assumed to be relatively small , the local oscillations attain almost full amplitude , so that we will mainly be interested in the phase pattern .",
    "the pattern consists of two distinct domains . in one domain which appears near the boundaries , the pattern is spatially continuous and smooth , whereas in the central domain spatial continuity seems completely lost .",
    "the pattern as a whole looks steadily advancing upward , implying that the entire population is undergoing regular collective oscillation with a definite frequency @xmath9 .    to investigate the nature and origin of such patterns in further detail , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is reduced to a phase equation which would be much easier to analyze .",
    "the phase reduction is valid when the coupling strength @xmath8 is small , which is actually the case , and the reduced equation takes the form @xmath10 where the time scale has been so changed as to normalize the coupling strength , @xmath11 is the natural frequency rescaled accordingly , and the phase constant @xmath12 in the phase - coupling function is related to the original parameters through @xmath13 under the parameter condition corresponding to the previous numerical simulation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , a phase pattern similar to fig .  1 was obtained , which is displayed in fig .  2 .",
    "we now focus on the phase patterns obtained for our phase equation .",
    "let us introduce relative phase @xmath14 by @xmath15 which describes the dynamics of the phase deviation from the reference motion with some drift velocity @xmath9 whose value is still open .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( 4 ) using @xmath14 as @xmath16 as a generalization of the theory of synchronization transition of globally coupled phase oscillators with frequency distribution , we introduce a complex order parameter with modulus @xmath17 and phase @xmath18 through @xmath19=r(x , t)\\exp[i\\theta(x , t)].\\ ] ] unlike the order parameter defined for globally coupled oscillators , the above quantity is space - dependent . still a physical picture is valid such that we are practically working with an assembly of _ independent _ oscillators under the control of a common forcing field represented by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is confirmed by rewriting eq .",
    "( 7 ) in terms of the order parameter into a forced one - oscillator equation as @xmath20 the spatial profiles of @xmath21 and @xmath22 after a long - time average are displayed in fig .",
    "3a and 3b , respectively .",
    "we see that the forcing mean - field amplitude is stronger near the boundaries and weaker near the center of the system . if the phase distribution such as shown in fig .",
    "2 is statistically stationary within a constant overall drift with velocity @xmath9 , then @xmath17 and @xmath18 are time - independent .",
    "their approximate constancy is confirmed by the fact that the fluctuation of the time sequence of @xmath23 observed at the midpoint of the system @xmath7 gives a standard deviation as small as 0.008 which comes possibly from a finite - size effects .",
    "similar property can also be confirmed for @xmath24 .",
    "figure 3c shows a distribution of the actual frequencies @xmath25 of the individual oscillators .",
    "this was also obtained through a long - time average . in the coherent domain ,",
    "the oscillation frequencies have an identical value @xmath9 , while in the incoherent domain they are distributed but give a well - defined continuous curve .",
    "the dynamics which is going on is now clear .",
    "the system is divided into two subgroups of oscillators . in the first group ,",
    "the forcing amplitude is large enough for the oscillators to be entrained , so that they oscillate with an identical frequency @xmath9 . in the second group , in contrast",
    ", the forcing amplitude is too weak for entrainment , so that the frequencies of the individual oscillators differ from @xmath9 . since the actual frequencies of these desynchronized oscillators should depend on the local amplitude of the forcing , the nonuniform but smooth pattern of @xmath21 as shown in fig .",
    "3a implies a smooth distribution of the actual frequencies , and this is consistent with fig .",
    "3c showing @xmath25 .",
    "our next problem is how to predict stationary patterns of @xmath21 and @xmath22 theoretically , and this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "the basic equations to work with below are eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be time - independent , we first try to find solutions of eq .",
    "( 9 ) for the phases @xmath26 each of which should be a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these solutions are then substituted into eq .",
    "( 8) , leading to an equation for determining @xmath17 and @xmath18 as a _ functional _ of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a self - consistent manner .",
    "since the collective frequency @xmath9 is still to be determined , we will be working with a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .    here",
    "a question may arise as to the seeming contradiction between the assumed time - independence of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the apparent time - dependence of the solution of eq .",
    "( 9 ) which is true if @xmath21 is below a certain critical value .",
    "the same problem was encountered in the problem of synchronization transition in globally coupled phase oscillators with frequency distribution .",
    "the answer to this question is that the factor @xmath27 $ ] appearing in the integral of eq .",
    "( 8) should be replaced with is statistical average @xmath28 \\rangle$ ] .",
    "such an average can be calculated using a suitable invariant measure which is easy to find .",
    "the successive steps to be taken for reaching the final solution are the following .",
    "note first that eq .",
    "( 9 ) admits two types of solutions depending on the location of the oscillators of concern .",
    "they are constant solutions and drifting solutions .",
    "if @xmath29 , we have a time - independent solution given by @xmath30 if @xmath31 , in contrast , we have a drifting solution .",
    "the actual frequency @xmath32 of the corresponding desynchronized oscillator as a function or @xmath17 is given by @xmath33 which equals the collective frequency @xmath9 plus the mean drift velocity of @xmath14 .",
    "instead of using such drifting solutions in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we use an invariant measure , i.e. , the probability density @xmath34 such that @xmath14 takes on value @xmath35 for given @xmath17 , which is inversely proportional to the drift velocity of @xmath14 at @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 where c is a normalization constant given by @xmath38 .",
    "as noted earlier , this invariant measure is used for replacing the exponential factor appearing on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 8) with its statistical average .",
    "the physical idea underlying this replacement is that an equilibrium statistical ensemble may be applicable to each small local subsystem because infinitely many oscillators which are independently oscillating are already contained in such a subsystem .    the spatial profile of @xmath21 in fig .",
    "3 implies that there are spatial points @xmath39 at which @xmath17 takes a critical value separating the two types of solutions described above .",
    "namely , in the inner domain ( @xmath40 ) the solutions are drifting , while in the outer domain ( @xmath40 ) they are constant in time .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( 8) becomes @xmath41 h\\bigl(r(x')\\bigr)=r(x)\\exp[i\\theta(x)],\\ ] ] where @xmath42 &   \\quad ( |x'-\\frac{1}{2}|\\ge x_{c})\\\\ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\exp(i\\theta)p(\\theta , r)d\\theta & \\quad ( |x'-\\frac{1}{2}| < x_{c } ) \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the above expression for @xmath43 in each domain can further be made explicit as @xmath44&=&\\sqrt{1-\\bigl ( \\frac{\\omega-\\omega}{r } \\bigr)^2 } + i\\frac{\\omega-\\omega}{r},\\\\ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\exp(i\\theta)p(\\theta , r)\\d\\theta & = & \\frac{i}{r}\\bigl\\ { \\omega-\\omega- \\sqrt{(\\omega-\\omega)^{2}-r^{2 } } \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( 13)@xmath45(16 ) constitute a functional self - consistency condition from which @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath9 are to be determined . by using @xmath21 and @xmath9 thus obtained , the actual frequencies of the desynchronized oscillators are determined from eq .  ( 11 ) .",
    "there is a unique value @xmath9 of the collective frequency for which our functional self - consistency equation admits a solution",
    ". such solution can be obtained numerically , and is compared with our numerical simulation .",
    "some of the results are given in fig .",
    "we find that the agreement between the theory and numerical experiments is almost perfect for each quantity of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath9 and @xmath25 .",
    "the present theory makes full use of the fact that the number of oscillators contained in the range of coupling is practically infinite .",
    "this fact allows us to apply a mean field theory , and our problem is reduced to a one - oscillator problem supplemented with a self - consistency condition .",
    "it is well known that the same idea works nicely for globally coupled oscillators .",
    "the present theory suggests that , beyond a special problem discussed in the present paper , the mean - field idea may work more generally for nonlocally coupled systems as far as the coupling radius remains much longer than the minimum length scale associated with the discreteness of the spatial distribution of the constituent oscillators .",
    "the present work gives a slight extension of the my old work on globally coupled phase oscillators which was developed in the middle of 1970 s , shortly after which i spent a very fruitful year at professor hermann haken s institute in stuttgart .",
