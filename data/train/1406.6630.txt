    "the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation u_t + a u^2 u_x + b u_xxx = 0 [ mkdveq ] ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary positive constants ) is an integrable evolution equation which arises in many physical applications , such as acoustic waves in anharmonic lattices @xcite and alfven waves in collision - free plasmas @xcite .",
    "its well - known integrability properties consist of multi - soliton solutions , a lax pair , a bi - hamiltonian structure , an infinite hierarchy of symmetries and conservation laws , and a bilinear formulation .",
    "soliton solutions of the mkdv equation are solitary waves u(t , x ) = ( ( x - ct ) ) [ realsoliton ] whose shape , wave speed @xmath6 , and up / down orientation @xmath7 are preserved after undergoing collisions .",
    "these waves have a mathematical characterization as stable travelling wave solutions that are single - peaked , unidirectional , and decaying for large @xmath8 .",
    "collisions of two or more mkdv solitary waves are described by multi - soliton solutions that reduce to a linear superposition of distinct solitary waves in the asymptotic past and future .",
    "all mkdv soliton solutions carry mass , momentum , energy , as well as galilean energy associated with the motion of center of momentum , which are constants of motion arising from conservation laws for the mkdv equation . remarkably , the only net effect of a collision is to shift the asymptotic positions of the solitary waves such that the center of momentum moves at a constant speed throughout the collision .",
    "there are exactly two integrable complex generalizations @xcite of the mkdv equation .",
    "one is the hirota equation @xcite @xmath9 and the other is the sasa - satsuma equation @xcite @xmath10 these two equations share the same scaling symmetry t^3 t , xx , u^-1 u [ scalingsymm ] admitted by the mkdv equation , and possess an additional @xmath0 phase symmetry u(i ) u .",
    "[ phasesymm ] both the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation are interesting physically and mathematically . in particular , under a galilean transformation @xmath11 , @xmath12 combined with a phase - modulation transformation @xmath13 , each equation takes the form of a 3rd order generalization of the nonlinear schrodinger equation , describing short wave pulses in optical fibers @xcite and deep water waves @xcite . both equations have integrability properties similar to those of the mkdv equation , and their solitary wave solutions have the form of mkdv solitons up to a phase factor u(t , x ) = ( i ) f_mkdv(x - ct ) [ mkdv1soliton ] where @xmath6 is the speed and @xmath14 is the phase angle , and where @xmath15 is the envelope function [ mkdvenvel ] f_mkdv(x - ct)= ( ( x - ct ) ) . for each equation and ,",
    "collisions of two or more solitary waves are described by multi - soliton solutions with the main feature that the net effect on the solitary waves is a shift in their asymptotic positions , while their asymptotic phases stay unchanged in the case of the hirota equation but undergo a shift in the case of the sasa - satsuma equation .",
    "the actual nonlinear interaction of these solitary waves during a collision exhibits interesting features which depend on the speed ratios and relative phase angles of the waves , as studied in recent work @xcite .",
    "( see the animations at http://lie.math.brocku.ca/~sanco/solitons/mkdv_solitons.php )    most interestingly , both the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation possess a more general type of soliton solution @xcite u(t , x ) = ( i ) ( i(x + t ) ) f(kx+wt ) [ envel1soliton ] which has the form of a solitary wave @xmath16 , with speed @xmath17 and phase angle @xmath18 , modulated by a harmonic wave @xmath19 , with frequency @xmath20 and wave length @xmath21 , satisfying the algebraic relations [ wkrels ] w =- b k(k^2 - 3 ^ 2 ) , = -b ( 3k^2-^2 ) , 0 .",
    "the envelope function @xmath22 in this solution differs from @xmath15 , specifically [ henvel ] f_h(kx+wt)= |k| ( kx+wt ) in the case of the hirota equation , and [ ssenvel ] f_ss(kx+wt)= in the case of the sasa - satsuma equation . if @xmath23 ( and hence @xmath24 ) then these envelope functions and reduce to @xmath15 , whereby the soliton solution reduces to the solitary wave .",
    "in contrast to an ordinary soliton , the envelope speed c =- w / k = b(k^2 - 3 ^ 2 ) can be positive , negative , or zero , depending on whether @xmath25 is less than , greater than , or equal to @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "consequently , harmonically modulated solitons can have three different types of collisions : ( 1 ) _ right - overtake _  where a faster right - moving soliton overtakes a slower right - moving soliton or a stationary soliton ; ( 2 ) _ left - overtake _  where a faster left - moving soliton overtakes a slower left - moving soliton or a stationary soliton ; ( 3 ) _ head - on _  where a right - moving soliton collides with a left - moving soliton .",
    "all of these collisions can be expected to exhibit highly interesting new features compared to collisions of ordinary solitons .",
    "however , very little seems to be known about the explicit behaviour of colliding harmonically modulated soliton solutions in the literature on the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation , although general formulas yielding the harmonically modulated multi - soliton solutions for both equations have been known for some time @xcite",
    ".    the present paper and a sequel paper will be devoted to studying the basic properties of harmonically modulated complex solitons and their nonlinear interactions .",
    "one new aspect of the analysis is that it will introduce a direct physical parameterization for these solitons , which will greatly help in understanding their interaction properties .    in section  [ bilinear ] ,",
    "we use a bilinear formulation of general @xmath0-invariant complex mkdv equations to derive explicit expressions for the harmonically modulated 2-soliton solutions @xmath27 of the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation .",
    "the envelope functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 turn out to be complex functions , which implies that the solitary wave envelopes are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 while their modulation comes from the overall phases @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , for the purpose of analytically and graphically understanding these solutions , it is mathematically and physically preferable to rewrite the expressions in a different parameterization given by the speed of the envelopes and the frequency of the modulations .    in section  [ kinematics ]",
    ", we first express the harmonically modulated 1-soliton solutions in the direct physical parameterization u(t , x ) = ( i)(it ) f(x - ct ) [ oscil1soliton ] involving only the envelope speed @xmath17 , a temporal modulation frequency @xmath34 , and the phase angle @xmath18 .",
    "we show that @xmath35 and @xmath36 obey a simple kinematic relation which gives a direct way to classify the cases for which @xmath35 is positive , negative , or zero , depending only on @xmath36 . in particular , when the envelope speed is @xmath37 , these solutions describe time - periodic standing waves u(t , x ) = ( i)(it ) f(x ) .",

    "oscillatory @xmath2-soliton_. the special case describes a solitary wave solution that has speed @xmath35 and involves two temporal frequencies @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "when these frequencies are related by @xmath43 , the resulting wave is a _ breather _ , which has the equivalent general form u(t , x ) = ( i_0)f(x - ct , t+ ) [ breather ] involving the frequency @xmath44 and the phase angles @xmath45 and @xmath46 . when the frequencies are independent , @xmath47 , we will write the solitary wave solution in a similar physical form u(t , x ) = ( i(_0 t+_0 ) ) f(x - ct , t+ ) [ oscilbreather ] which we call an _ oscillatory breather _",
    ", with an envelope frequency @xmath48 and phase angle @xmath45 , and a temporal modulation frequency @xmath49 and phase angle @xmath46 .",
    "we emphasize that this oscillatory form for the harmonically modulated 1-soliton and 2-soliton solutions presented in section  [ kinematics ] is more mathematically clear and more physically meaningful than the standard form and found in the literature .",
    "in particular , the frequency and speed parameters used in the oscillatory form and have a direct physical meaning which is conceptually simpler for studying collision properties of harmonically modulated solitary waves .",
    "our main results are obtained in section  [ properties ] .",

    "modulated solitons are sought or real constants if ordinary solitons are sought instead .",
