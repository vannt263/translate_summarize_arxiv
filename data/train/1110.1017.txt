    "the high red - shift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) have emerged as a unique probe to cosmic evolution containing important information on the physics , and the properties of the early universe .",
    "it had been well established that radio sources with steep radio spectra are more distant than sources with normal spectra .",
    "this correlation between @xmath1 and _ z _ has been exploited in the last three decades @xcite which yielded about 45 radio galaxies at z @xmath2 3 till date .",
    "the median flux density of all of these known hzrgs is 1.3 jy at 150 mhz which is two orders of magnitude above the detection limit of the gmrt at 150 mhz .",
    "the gmrt 150 mhz has high angular resolution of @xmath0 @xmath3 , and better sensitivity @xmath0 1 mjy , suggesting that a large number of hzrgs , two orders of magnitude less luminous than all of the known objects , can be detected with gmrt @xcite . to this effect ,",
    "we have carried out deep 150 mhz observations of three of the four deep2 ( deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 ) fields , which has optical spectra of @xmath0 50,000 objects .",
    "one of the deep deep2 fields centered on 2330 + 0000 was analysed using aips++ @xcite , and the final image obtained has an rms noise @xmath0 1 mjy / beam with a resolution of @xmath3 .",
    "the 150 mhz source catalog of this field contains @xmath0 400 radio sources to @xmath4 peak primary beam response with flux density limit of @xmath0 6 mjy while the median flux density is @xmath0 100 mjy .",
    "the spectral index is estimated by comparison of 150 mhz flux density with that of nvss and first at 1.4 ghz .",
    "a total of 368 sources from gmrt 150 mhz catalog has counterparts found at first and/or nvss .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectral index distribution of sources as a function of 150 mhz flux density . above a cutoff of @xmath1 = 1",
    ", there are about 100 steep spectrum sources .",
