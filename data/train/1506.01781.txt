    "[ fig : selfenergy](b ) , should have the largest contribution .",
    "we found that the effect of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfenergy](b ) is to reduce the anharmonic frequency for the fe mode .",
    "second , since the quantum effect of nuclear motion is not considered in the md simulation , the thermal average of the squared normal coordinate @xmath159 is underestimated for temperatures below the debye temperature in the tdep approach .",
    "therefore , the renormalization of anharmonic effects is underestimated in the tdep approach , which explains why the deviation from the scph result becomes larger with decreasing temperature ( see to1 mode in fig .",

    "as can be seen in the figure , the frequency of the afd mode is severely size - dependent . for the 2@xmath1152@xmath1152 @xmath89 grid",
    ", we do not observe a _ freezing - out _ of the afd mode even at absolute zero .",
    "when we increase the @xmath89-grid density and allow interactions with longer - wavelength phonons , we observe the precursor of the freezing - out of the afd mode at temperatures near 200 k. although the soft - mode frequency does not reach zero in the current simulation with finite @xmath89 points , this would occur in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath160 as discussed by cowley  @xcite . above approximately 300 k",
    ", the temperature - dependence can be reliably fitted by the equation @xmath161 . applying this equation to the result obtained using the 12@xmath11512@xmath11512 @xmath89 grid",
    ", we obtain the @xmath162 of the cubic - to - tetragonal phase transition as 220 k.    for comparison , we have plotted experimental results in figs .",
    "[ fig : scph_band ] ,  [ fig : scph_g15 ] , and [ fig : scph_r25 ] using open symbols .",
    "the scph equation reproduces the temperature - dependence of the soft modes qualitatively , but not quantitatively , i.e. , the frequencies of the fe and afd modes are overestimated and underestimated , respectively . because the adf frequency is underestimated , the transition temperature predicted is twice as large as the experimental value of 105 k. we consider this deviation to be acceptable because phonon - related properties of ferroelectric materials are known to be sensitive to the lattice constant and exchange - correlation functional employed  @xcite . in this study , we employed the pbesol functional to avoid problems inherent to the local - density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized - gradient approximation with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof parameterization ( pbe )  @xcite ; lda tends to underestimate the equilibrium volume , whereas pbe tends to overestimate it .",
    "however , our numerical results suggest that pbesol can not give a quantitative description of c - sto .",
    "this issue is expected to be resolved , at least partially , by employing a hybrid functional .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the functional dependence of the harmonic frequency in the fe mode of c - sto and reported the results of 29@xmath163 and 74@xmath163 for the pbesol",
    "semilocal and the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid functionals  @xcite , respectively .",
    "since the harmonic frequency changes as @xmath164 , we expect that the fock exchange can increase the depth of the double - well potential , thereby decreasing the anharmonic frequency of the fe mode .",
    "_ also reported that the energy gain for the afd phase was smaller in hse than in the pbesol functional .",
    "this indicates that the depth of the double - well potential for the afd mode can be decreased , and the anharmonic frequency can be increased by using hse instead of pbesol .",
    "therefore , we believe that the quantitative accuracy of the present scph results could be improved by employing a hybrid functional , which will be the topic of future work .    in the present scph calculations we have not considered effects related to the cubic anharmonicity , such as thermal expansion , relaxation of internal coordinates and intrinsic frequency shifts due to the bubble diagram . however , these effects can , in general , become important in severely anharmonic systems",

    "this can be attributed to the large group velocities of phonons , especially of to modes above @xmath176 100 @xmath157 , which contribute significantly to the total @xmath3 value  @xcite .",
    "the lifetime shows a characteristic feature in the low - frequency region ( @xmath177 100 @xmath157 ) : the phonon modes split into two separate regions in @xmath178 ps and @xmath179 ps , where the former corresponds to the acoustic modes that follow the frequency dependence of @xmath180 , which has been observed in other materials  @xcite , and the latter corresponds to the phonon modes around the r point , which indicates the severe anharmonicity of the afd mode .",
    "we developed an _ ab initio _ method to compute anharmonic phonon frequencies and lifetimes that can be applied to severely anharmonic systems .",
    "the method employs anharmonic force constants up to the fourth order , which are extracted from dft calculations using a compressive sensing approach .",
    "the frequency renormalization associated with the quartic anharmonicity is treated non - perturbatively using the scph theory . by performing the perturbation calculation after the scph solution",

    "we applied the method to the high - temperature phase of perovskite srtio@xmath0 . unlike the harmonic phonon dispersion ,",
    "the scph solution was free from the imaginary branches in the entire brillouin zone .",
    "we found that including polarization mixing is important to correctly account for the temperature dependence of the phonon frequency of the ferroelectric soft mode of perovskite oxides . in addition , we examined the size - dependence of the anharmonic frequencies of the soft modes and found that long - wavelength phonons significantly reduced the anharmonic frequencies , especially for the antiferrodistortive mode near the transition temperature .",
    "the temperature - dependence of the soft mode frequencies calculated using the scph theory agreed qualitatively well with the experimental results .",
    "however , the quantitative accuracy of the present calculations based on the pbesol functional was unsatisfactory , where we obtained the cubic - to - tetragonal transition temperature as @xmath181 k that was twice as large as the experimental value of 105 k. although further theoretical investigations are required to understand the origin of this discrepancy , we expect that the quantitative agreement can be improved by employing a hybrid functional .",
    "we also calculated the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath1 of cubic srtio@xmath0 using the boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation - time approximation .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 values reproduced experimental results especially in the high temperature region .",
    "the underestimation of @xmath1 in the low temperature region may be attributed to the overestimation ( underestimation ) of the ferroelectric ( antiferrodistortive ) soft mode , which will be addressed in a future work .    the present method , which combines the scph theory with perturbation approach based on anharmonic force constants , enables us to obtain the anharmonic phonon frequencies and lifetimes at various temperatures efficiently just by changing the occupation number .",
    "the system size dependency can be investigated using the reciprocal space formalism .",
    "therefore , we believe that the present method paves the way for understanding lattice anharmonicity and related dynamical and thermodynamical properties of thermoelectric , ferroelectric , and superconducting materials .",
