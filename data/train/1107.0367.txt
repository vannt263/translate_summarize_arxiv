    "many important solar phenomena are driven by the interaction of turbulent plasma with magnetic fields .",
    "measurements of the full state of polarization of solar spectral lines are routinely used to infer properties of solar vector magnetic fields from their imprints in the emergent spectra through the zeeman and hanle effects .",
    "all ground - based measurements are detrimentally affected by image distortion introduced by atmospheric seeing , which has significant power at frequencies up to at least @xmath0hz , significantly higher than the frame rates of typical ccd cameras .",
    "the seeing - induced errors due to image distortion during an observation are expected to increase as the telescope aperture increases in size , since the telescope can then resolve finer structures and hence observe steeper gradients in images .",
    "the advanced technology solar telescope ( atst ; * ? ? ?",

    "the european solar telescope ( est ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also a 4-m class telescope currently under design .",
    "spectro - polarimetry is the prime mode of operation of this new generation of solar telescopes , but there is an urgent need to identify potential pitfalls before committing to a particular design for the modulation and detection of polarized light using such telescopes .",
    "space - based spectro - polarimetric instruments , like those on - board the hinode ( solar - b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spacecrafts , are by necessity fed by smaller telescopes , and while their observations profit greatly from the absence of atmospheric disturbances , they are still affected by residual image motion due to spacecraft jitter .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to re - examine and extend earlier theoretical studies of polarization errors introduced by the effects of atmospheric seeing .",
    "potentially , this can help refine the instrument requirements for the polarization systems of these large , multi - national projects , as well as of future solar space missions , such as solar - c @xcite .",
    "two modes of operation are of particular interest for our study .",
    "slit - based spectro - polarimeters often use long integration times , including a number of modulation cycles that is typically of the order of a few tens . because of the need to scan across the spectral line domain",
    ", tunable imaging spectro - polarimeters typically implement much fewer measurements of the modulated intensities  often just one modulation cycle  for each wavelength position .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper is general , and can be applied to both types of instruments and observations .",
    "a substantial difference between the two types of observations is that post - processing techniques such as image shifting and de - stretching can be effectively adopted to partially correct for seeing - induced distortion in observations done with imaging polarimeters , whereas this option is not available in the case of slit - based spectro - polarimeters .    a separate question  also of fundamental importance for observational spectro - polarimetery  concerns the effects of polarization calibration errors on the degree of polarization cross - talk affecting an observation .",
    "this subject has been exhaustively treated by @xcite , and therefore it will not be addressed here .    the plan of this paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ sec : seeing ] , we describe a model for the effects of atmospheric seeing on the polarization signals detected by an observer . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we lay the foundation of the formalism . using the point of view of the statistics of random processes we define the fundamental statistical observables for spectro - polarimetry in the presence of atmospheric seeing . in sect .",
    "[ sec : dualbeam ] , this formalism is extended to the case of dual - beam polarimetry , emphasizing those aspects of the problem where this extension is not trivial . in sect .",
    "[ sec : covariances ] we make use of the conceptual framework of the statistics of stationary random processes to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of seeing correlations on spectro - polarimetric measurements . in particular , in that section we study qualitatively the effect of adaptive optics ( ao ) corrections on the temporal decay of seeing correlations . those results are successively applied to study the performance of two popular modulation schemes in the presence of seeing . in sect .",
    "[ sec : generalization ] , these results are further generalized to the case in which seeing correlations extend over the duration of one elemental observation ( e.g. , one slit position ) , and the effects of seeing on the performance of optimally efficient modulation schemes are studied both in the absence and in the presence of low - order ( i.e. , tip - tilt ) ao corrections ( based on observed data ) .",
    "finally , we compare our results and conclusions with those from previous works on the subject .",
    "we conventionally describe the polarization state of a radiation beam by its stokes vector , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the intensity of radiation , @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe the two independent states of linear polarization on the plane normal to the propagation direction , and finally @xmath5 is the parameter for circular polarization .    because photon detectors are practically sensitive only to the intensity of the incoming radiation , the measurement of polarized radiation requires that its states of polarization be encoded into intensity signals .",
    "this encoding process is conventionally called _ modulation _ , and it is most often achieved through time - varying optical devices ( modulators ) that modify in a known way the polarization states of the incoming radiation .",
    "let @xmath6 be the four - vector describing the polarization modulation process for the four stokes parameters , so that @xmath7 gives the detected signal of the modulated intensity at time @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : signal_i ] ] below ) .",
    "we will assume that this modulation vector is perfectly known ( either by design or calibration ) , and that it is a periodic function of time , so that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the period of the modulation cycle .",
    "because of these properties , the time process of polarization modulation is both _",
    "deterministic _ and _ stationary _ in a statistical sense .",
    "evidently one needs at least four independent measurements during a modulation cycle to fully determine the stokes vector .",
    "the actual number of measurements @xmath11 taken during a given modulation cycle represents the number of modulation states for that cycle .",
    "we also assume that the physical conditions of the light emitting region are stationary during the time interval @xmath12 needed to perform a _",
    "complete _ spectro - polarimetric observation of a given element of spatial or spectral sampling , with the required sensitivity . in",
    "what follows , the term `` complete observation '' will always refer to such elemental operation , for instance , the integration of the light signal at one slit position of a spatial scan , in the case of a grating - based spectro - polarimeter , or at one wavelength position of a spectral scan , in the case of a tunable , imaging spectro - polarimeter .",
    "evidently , such observation must always include at least one full modulation cycle . in the presence of atmospheric seeing , a given pixel on the detector collects photons from different areas of the observed region , with a characteristic time scale @xmath13 ( @xmath14s ) .",
    "the cause for this `` smearing '' of the image can be a true displacement of the target by the seeing during the integration time , or seeing - induced distortions of the effective psf at the detector , which determine a time - varying weighing of different elements of the observed region .",
    "this time - dependent smearing is in addition to the one determined by diffraction because of the finite aperture of the telescope . as a result , the combined effect of the atmosphere and the telescope is to smoothen the stokes gradients present in the observed region , through a smearing length that is determined by the spatial resolution of the observation .    in order to demonstrate this intuitive result",
    ", we begin by considering the ideal case of a perfectly stigmatic optical system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) observing in the absence of atmospheric seeing . in this case ,",
    "a 1 - 1 mapping can be established between the object and the image planes .",
    "we indicate with @xmath15 the stokes vector falling on the _ _ resolution element _ _ pixels , or a larger number for performance worse than the diffraction limit . ] of coordinates @xmath16 on the image plane , at a given time @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , we indicate with @xmath17 the stokes vector emitted by the element on the object plane ( i.e. , the solar surface ) that corresponds to the element @xmath16 on the detector , through the inverse mapping from the image plane onto the object plane .",
    "note that the stokes vector at the source is not given as a function of time , in agreement with the condition stated earlier that the time interval @xmath12 to perform an elemental observation should be much shorter than the typical evolution time of the observed solar structure .    as customary",
    ", we assume that the transport of radiation from the object plane to the image plane is described by a linear operator .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the transfer ( mueller ) matrix at time @xmath8 of the imaging system telescope+atmosphere , which maps the element @xmath20 on the object plane to the corresponding resolution element @xmath16 on the image plane . in the ideal case of a perfectly stigmatic telescope , and in the absence of atmospheric seeing , evidently @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transfer matrix of the imaging system , pertaining to the element @xmath16 of the field of view .    the general form of eq .",

    "can only be an approximation , under these more general observing conditions . ] the stokes vector measured by the detector is thus properly expressed as a function of the time , because of the variability of the atmosphere .",
    "possible temporal variations of the instrument  for example , due to the changing optical configuration of the telescope during tracking of the target  are not a concern here , since their time scale is typically much larger than @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in practice , the transfer matrix on the rhs of eq .  ( [ eq : model.diag ] ) can be assumed to be constant .    when observations are affected by atmospheric seeing , the spatial resolution  and thus the size of the resolution element on the detector",
    " depends critically on the particular observing conditions , such as the possible presence of ao corrections , and the temporal resolution of the observation ( i.e. , the exposure time ) , because of the effects of image smearing mentioned above .",
    "for example , in the limit of long time exposures , and in the absence of ao corrections , the spatial resolution is completely determined by the fried parameter @xmath23 of the atmospheric seeing @xcite . according to the van cittert - zernike theorem ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , distinct resolution elements can be regarded as incoherent light sources .",
    "the linear superposition of the source stokes vectors expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : model0 ] ) is thus justified by this assumption of spatial and temporal incoherence of the radiation emitted by resolved structures on the object plane .",

    "( [ eq : boundary ] ) .",
    "for example , in the absence of ao corrections and for long time exposures , the smearing length is approximately given by the spatial resolution corresponding to @xmath23 , but the region of isoplanatism typically includes several of these resolution elements .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the set of points @xmath20 contributing to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : part1 ] ) always lies inside a region where the assumption of shift - invariance of the transfer matrix is valid .",

    "* ) , we can assume that all possible realizations @xmath38 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) will eventually manifest themselves at @xmath39 during the evolution of the atmospheric seeing .",
    "in other words , we can associate a stationary random process @xmath40 to the displacement vector of the image motion , which describes the effect of atmospheric seeing to the lowest order , such that ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) . because of the random nature of atmospheric seeing , the long - time average of @xmath45 is zero , and therefore @xmath42 coincides with the stokes vector that would be measured in the absence of atmospheric seeing .    for small telescopes with apertures of order @xmath23 , the detected signal at any given time",
    "is mostly affected by low - order aberrations of the wavefront , so that the seeing displacement vector @xmath40 can be effectively compensated just by the tip and tilt corrections . for large aperture telescopes , such that @xmath46 is of order 10 or larger , @xmath47 being the telescope s diameter , the distortions of the incoming wavefront are significantly more complex , resulting in the characteristic dynamic pattern of _ speckles _ on the image plane .",
    "nonetheless , even in this more general case , the low - order zernike terms corresponding to the tip - tilt wavefront correction still account for the largest part of the seeing induced effects on the image @xcite .",
    "we note that this more general case is still captured by the model of eq .",

    "thus , as long as a linear approximation of @xmath48 around @xmath49 is justified , eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) also describes the lowest order effects of seeing in observations performed with a large telescope .",
    "of course , the requirements for the validity of the linear approximation ( [ eq : model ] ) become more stringent as the spatial resolution increases with the ao correction , because of the enhanced contrast of the image , and the expected increased complexity of the structure of the solar atmosphere at smaller spatial scales .",
    "in fact , as it has already been pointed out , the spatial range of applicability of the linear model ( [ eq : model ] ) decreases like @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ao corrections effectively reduce the rms displacement vector that can be associated with the residual image motion .",
    "therefore , because of the overall scaling of the problem , we can expect that the linear model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) will remain applicable even in the presence of ao corrections , at least as far as the effects of residual image motion are concerned .",
    "higher - order effects may be responsible for local fluctuations of the image intensity not associated with image motions , which would also be a source of polarization cross - talk , and they may even occur as image artifacts introduced by the same ao corrections . a quantitative study of these effects lies beyond the scope of this paper , but it could perhaps be pursued through an extension of the formalism presented in this work .",
