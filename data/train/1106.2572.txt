    "non - uniformity in the detector gain due to the input light position was relatively corrected by mounting a spherical plate uniformly covered with luminous paint on the input window . to correct for the time variation of the photometric and trigger sensitivity because of variations in atmospheric optical thickness , which were mainly due to clouds and hazes during the observation period , we performed careful cross - calibration to compare the instrumental photoelectric response with the photometry of standard stars such as bd+75d325 of b - magnitude 9.2 , for which the detected images passed through the same optical and photoelectric instruments except for the final trigger - controlled readout device . we estimated the systematic uncertainty on the basis of our understanding of the detector sensitivity to be 30% after applying a combination of the above three complementary calibration procedures .    to validate the detection sensitivity and gain calibration for the cherenkov @xmath1 shower , we detected and analyzed 140 events of ordinary cosmic - ray air - shower cherenkov images for a total of 44.4  hr in 2008 december using the same instruments used in the ashra light collector , but after rearranging the trigger pixel layout to view the sky field above mauna kea ( fig .",
