    "in proton - proton ( @xmath7 ) collisions produced by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at high center - of - mass energy ( @xmath8 ) , the production of jets is the dominant high transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) process .",
    "inclusive jet and dijet cross sections have been measured with the atlas detector @xcite for first time at an energy more than 3 times higher than that of the measurements done at tevatron .",
    "the measurements presented here are performed using the data collected between 30 march and 5 june 2010 , when the lhc delivered @xmath7 collisions at @xmath10 .",
    "the data correspond to an integrated luminosity of @xmath11 and have negligible impact from pile - up events .",
    "the integrated luminosities are calculated run - by - run using the van der meer calibration technique @xcite .",
    "the measured cross sections extend up to a jet @xmath9 of @xmath12 and dijet masses of @xmath13 .",
    "leading logarithmic ( lo ) parton - shower monte carlo ( mc ) programs provide a reasonable description of the shapes of the measured cross section distributions and of the energy flow in the proximity of the jets .",
    "all measurements are well described by next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative calculations corrected for non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "jets are identified using the infrared - safe anti-@xmath14 algorithm @xcite with size parameter @xmath3 , and using three - dimensional calorimeter clusters as input with full @xmath15-momenta recombination .",
    "jet energies are calibrated using a mc - derived @xmath9 and @xmath16-dependent calibration scheme @xcite .",
    "afterwards , jet @xmath15-momenta are corrected for the primary vertex position and for detector effects back to the hadron level .",
    "inclusive single - jet double - differential cross sections are measured as a function of the jet @xmath9 in slices of absolute rapidity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "dijet cross sections are measured as a function of the dijet mass in bins of @xmath18 and of the dijet angle @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the polar scattering angle in the dijet center - of - mass frame .",
    "it is also important that the energy flow around the jet cone is well understood and described by mc models .",
    "the energy and momentum flow within jets can be expressed in terms of the differential jet shape defined as the fraction , @xmath21 , of the jet momentum contained within a ring of thickness @xmath22 at a radius @xmath23 around the jet axis , divided by @xmath24 . this variable offers a useful indication of the sensitivity of the reconstructed jets to the hadron fragmentation and underlying event .    `",
    "pythia 6.4 ` event generator , with ` mstw l0`@xmath25 parton density function and a set of parameters ( ` atlas mc09 ` ) tuned to describe the exisiting minimum bias and underlying event data @xcite , was used to simulate jets in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath10 .",
    "these samples are used for the baseline comparisons , the study of the systematic uncertainties and for data corrections .",
    "the jet algorithm is run on calorimeter clusters assuming that the event vertex is at the origin .",
    "the jet @xmath15-momentum is then recalculated with respect to the @xmath26-position of the primary vertex .",
    "after calibration , all events are required to have at least one jet within the kinematic region @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "any subleading jets should have @xmath29 .",
    "additional quality criteria are also applied to ensure that jets are not produced by single noisy calorimeter cells nor problematic detector regions @xcite .",
    "events are required to have at least one vertex consistent with the beamspot position , with at least five tracks connected to it , and with @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath26 vertex distribution in the mc simulation is reweighted to agree with that in data .",
    "background contributions from non-@xmath7-collision sources were evaluated using unpaired and empty bunches and found to be negligible @xcite .",
    "two types of triggers are used to select events in this analysis",
    ". a minimum bias trigger , which requires a single minimum bias counter over threshold , was operated early in the data - taking period .",
    "it was used to trigger approximately @xmath31 of the integrated luminosity of the data sample analyzed .",
    "the lowest threshold jet trigger , uses a @xmath32 window size in @xmath33 space at the first level of the trigger system and requires a jet with @xmath34 at the  electromagnetic scale . both triggers",
    "are found to be fully efficient for selecting events with at least one jet with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the data correction for all trigger and detector efficiencies and resolutions , other than the energy scale correction already applied , is performed in a single step using a bin - by - bin migration function evaluated using validated mc samples . for each measured distribution ,",
    "final - state - particle cross section using ` pythia mc09 ` is evaluated in the relevant bins , along with the equivalent distributions as observed in the simulated detector .",
    "the ratio of the distributions provides a correction factor which is then applied to the data as seen in the detector .",
    "the dominant source of systematic uncertainty is from the jet energy response .",
    "this scale uncertainty has been determined to be below 10% over the whole kinematic range , and to be below 7% for central jets with @xmath37 , neglecting possible topological correlations between jets .",
    "this leads to an overall systematic uncertainty on the cross sections of around 40% @xcite .    the measured jet cross sections , corrected to particle - level ,",
    "are then compared to nlo perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "the ` nlojet++ ` program @xcite is used for all predictions , with ` applgrid ` @xcite being used for efficient evaluation of uncertainties . since the nlo calculations predict the value of partonic cross sections , which are not accessible , they are corrected for the non - perturbative effects of hadronization and underlying event . `",
    "pythia mc09 ` is used to derive the baseline correction factors , and ` pythia perugia0/hard / soft ` and ` herwig+jimmy ` @xcite are used for systematic variations .",
    "the main sources of theoretical uncertainties are the choice of renormalization and factorization scales , the parton distribution functions , @xmath38 and the modeling of soft qcd effects ( underlying event and parton hadronization processes ) @xcite .",
    "the overall uncertainty is defined by the envelope of maximum variation around the prediction obtained with ` pythia mc09 ` @xcite .",
    "[ subfig : fig1 ]   [ subfig : fig2 ]   [ subfig : fig3 ]   [ subfig : fig4 ]    figure  [ subfig : fig1 ] shows the double - differential cross section as a function of @xmath9 in several different regions of @xmath39 .",
    "the cross section extends from @xmath40 up to around @xmath41 , and falls by more than four orders of magnitude over this range .",
    "the error bars indicate the statistical uncertainty on the measurement , and the gray shaded band indicates the quadratic sum of the systematic uncertainties , dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "the theory uncertainty shown in orange is the quadratic sum of all uncertainties mentioned above . in all @xmath39 regions ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are consistent with the data .    in figure  [ subfig : fig2 ]",
    "the double - differential dijet cross section is shown as a function of the dijet mass @xmath42 , for different bins of the maximum @xmath39 of the two leading jets .",
    "the cross section falls rapidly with mass , but extends up to masses of nearly @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ subfig : fig3 ] shows the cross section as a function of the dijet angular variable @xmath6 for different ranges of the dijet mass .",
    "again , the theory is reasonably in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the jet shapes measured using calorimeter clusters , without applying any corrections for detector effects , are shown in figure  [ subfig : fig4 ] .",
    "the jets simulated by ` pythia 6 ` are slightly narrower than the jets in the data , while the ` herwig 6 + jimmy ` and ` herwig++ ` simulations provide a better description .",
    "inclusive and dijet cross sections have been measured in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath10 using the first data collected by the atlas detector .",
    "lo parton - shower mc programs provide a reasonable description of the energy flow around the jets , and the cross section distributions .",
