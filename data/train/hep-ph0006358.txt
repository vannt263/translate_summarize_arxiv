    "<S> considerable evidence has mounted that one or more of these neutrino species has a nonzero mass , based on the observation of neutrino oscillations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since neutrinos are massless in the standard model of particle physics , the observation of nonzero neutrino masses is our first evidence of physics beyond the standard model .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard model of the electroweak interaction is a gauge theory based on the local symmetry group su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the model contains three generations of quark and lepton fields and an su(2)@xmath5-doublet higgs field which acquires a vacuum - expectation value and breaks the su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4 symmetry to the u(1)@xmath6 symmetry of electromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> there are three reasons why neutrinos are massless in this model :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> only renormalizable interactions are included , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , terms in the lagrangian of mass dimension four or less . </S>",
    "<S> the unique term of dimension five allowed by the gauge symmetry is @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an su(2)@xmath5-doublet containing the left - chiral neutrino and charged - lepton fields and @xmath9 is the su(2)@xmath5-doublet higgs field ( @xmath10 is the antisymmetric @xmath11 matrix in su(2)@xmath5 space ; @xmath12 is the charge - conjugation matrix in dirac space ) . </S>",
    "<S> this term would give rise to a majorana neutrino mass @xmath13 when the neutral component of the higgs field acquires a vacuum - expectation value @xmath14 , where @xmath15 gev is the weak scale . </S>",

    "<S> , the gauge symmetry would allow a yukawa term @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the singlet field . </S>",
    "<S> such a term would result in a dirac neutrino mass @xmath18 when the neutral component of the higgs field acquires a vacuum - expectation value , in the same way that the other fermions acquire dirac masses . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge symmetry would also allow a majorana mass for the singlet field , @xmath19 majorana neutrino masses may also be generated via the addition of su(2)@xmath5-triplet , @xmath20 fermion fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the only scalar field is the su(2)@xmath5-doublet higgs field . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> no su(2)@xmath5-triplet , @xmath21 higgs field is present . if present , the gauge symmetry would allow a term @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the higgs triplet field </S>",
    "<S> . such a term would result in a majorana neutrino mass @xmath24 when the neutral component of the higgs triplet field , @xmath25 , acquires a vacuum - expectation value @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> majorana neutrino masses may also be generated via the addition of su(2)@xmath5-singlet scalar fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these restrictions eliminate the possibility of a dirac neutrino mass and yield an `` accidental '' global lepton - number symmetry , u(1)@xmath5 , which forbids a majorana neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry ( baryon number minus lepton number ) survives and suffices to enforce the masslessness of the neutrino @xcite . ] in this paper , we will encounter examples with massive neutrinos based on relaxing each of these three restrictions .- parity suffices to forbid such terms . ]    since neutrino masses are necessarily associated with physics beyond the standard model , one would like to know the energy scale at which this new physics resides . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we derive a model - independent upper bound on the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss two models that exemplify , and can even saturate , this bound : one with an su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4-singlet fermion field , and one with an su(2)@xmath5-triplet higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis we perform is in the spirit of a similar analysis for dirac fermions carried out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . however , there is no known model that saturates the upper bound on the scale of dirac - fermion mass generation @xcite , in contrast to the case of majorana neutrino masses addressed in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the neutrino masses are majorana , unlike the other known fermions , which carry electric charge and are therefore forbidden to have majorana masses </S>",
    "<S> . if there is no su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4-singlet fermion field in nature , then the neutrino masses are necessarily majorana . however , even if such a field exists , the gauge symmetry allows the majorana mass term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ majorana ] ) for this field , and there is no reason why this mass should be small . </S>",
    "<S> the other known fermions acquire a mass only after the su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4 symmetry is broken , and thus their masses are of order the weak scale , @xmath27 , or less . since a majorana mass for the @xmath17 field </S>",
    "<S> is not protected by the gauge symmetry , it is natural to assume that it would be much greater than the weak scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so even if the @xmath17 field exists it is likely to be heavy , in which case the light neutrinos are majorana fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin our analysis with the standard model , but with a majorana neutrino mass of unspecified origin . </S>",
    "<S> since the neutrino mass is put in artificially , this is only an effective field theory , valid up to some energy scale at which it is subsumed by a deeper theory , which we regard as the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation . </S>",
    "<S> the effective theory yields amplitudes that are an expansion in powers of energy divided by some mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way to derive an upper bound on the scale at which the effective theory breaks down is to examine tree - level @xmath28 scattering amplitudes and identify the ones that grow with energy . </S>",
    "<S> unitarity of the @xmath29-matrix ensures that partial - wave amplitudes of inelastic @xmath28 scattering processes can not exceed @xmath30 in absolute value . </S>",
    "<S> when that value is exceeded at tree level , it indicates that the effective field theory is no longer valid , because the energy expansion does not converge . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby discover the energy at which the effective field theory necessarily breaks down ; this represents an upper bound on the scale of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> this argument has been used to derive an upper bound on the scale of new physics in the fermi theory of the weak interaction @xcite , on the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking in the electroweak theory ( without a higgs field ) @xcite , and on the scale of dirac - fermion mass generation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitudes that grow with energy involve majorana neutrinos in the initial and/or intermediate state , and longitudinally - polarized weak vector bosons in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the feynman diagrams that contribute to the four relevant amplitudes are shown in fig .  1 . in the high - energy limit , @xmath31 , </S>",
    "<S> the zeroth - partial - wave amplitudes are given by the simple expressions @xmath32 where @xmath27 is the weak scale , the indices @xmath33 denote the three neutrino mass eigenstates , the subscripts on the neutrinos and charged leptons indicate helicity @xmath34 , and the subscript on the partial - wave amplitude indicates @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitary matrix @xmath36 relates the neutrino weak and mass eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> each amplitude grows linearly with energy , and is proportional to the majorana neutrino mass or a linear combination of masses . </S>",
    "<S> involves the same linear combination of masses as the amplitude for neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> = 8.6 cm    the strongest bound on the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation is obtained by considering a scattering process which is a linear combination of the above amplitudes : @xmath37 the unitarity condition on inelastic @xmath28 scattering amplitudes , @xmath38 @xcite , implies that the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation is less than the scale @xmath39 which is inversely proportional to the neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> this is the principal result of this paper .    to gain some intuition for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) , we consider three different mechanisms for the generation of a majorana neutrino mass . first consider the addition of the dimension - five term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dim5 ] ) to the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino acquires a majorana mass @xmath13 , where @xmath40 is the coefficient of the dimension - five term . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite the addition of an explicit source for the majorana neutrino mass , the theory remains an effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension - five term generates a @xmath41 vertex , where @xmath42 is the higgs boson , which leads to the additional feynman diagram in fig .  2 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ zz ] ) , the other three amplitudes continue to grow with energy . ) </S>",
    "<S> undergoes a sign change when the higgs diagram is included . </S>",
    "<S> the other two amplitudes have no additional contributions . ] </S>",
    "<S> thus there must still be new physics at or below the scale @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of a majorana neutrino mass via a nonrenormalizable dimension - five term can not promote an effective field theory to a renormalizable one .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.2 cm    consider instead the addition of an su(2)@xmath3u(1)@xmath4-singlet fermion field , @xmath17 , and the terms in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dirac ] ) and ( [ majorana ] ) , which are allowed by the gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the limit @xmath44 , motivated by our earlier argument that @xmath45 should be much greater than the weak scale while the dirac mass @xmath46 is of order or less than the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> this `` see - saw '' model yields a majorana neutrino of mass @xmath47 , which is much less than the dirac mass , and thus provides an attractive explanation of why neutrinos are so much lighter than the other known fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a heavy majorana neutrino , @xmath48 , approximately of mass @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this particle leads to the additional feynman diagrams obtained by replacing any intermediate @xmath49 state in fig .  1 with @xmath50 . a higgs diagram analogous to fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> must also be included . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the terms that grow with energy are cancelled in all four amplitudes of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ww])([ss ] ) , so the addition of these two dimension - four terms has promoted the effective field theory to a renormalizable one . the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation is the mass of the heavy majorana neutrino , @xmath51 , and since @xmath52 , one finds @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this respects the upper bound of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) provided the yukawa coupling @xmath54 , as it must @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bound is saturated when the yukawa coupling takes its largest allowed value .    </S>",
    "<S> the third mechanism introduces an su(2)@xmath5-triplet higgs field and the term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ triplet ] ) to generate a majorana neutrino mass @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the vacuum - expectation value of this field must be much less than the weak scale , because the relation @xmath55 , which is satisfied experimentally , is obtained if the weak bosons acquire their mass dominantly from the vacuum - expectation value of an su(2)@xmath5 doublet , but not a triplet . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> a small vacuum - expectation value for the triplet is desirable in order to generate small majorana neutrino masses ( @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model contains three neutral scalars , one singly - charged scalar , and one doubly - charged scalar . the term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ triplet ] ) gives rise to new interactions that yield the additional feynman diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 involving these higgs scalars in the intermediate state . these diagrams </S>",
    "<S> cancel the terms that grow with energy in the amplitudes of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ww])([ss ] ) , so once again the addition of a dimension - four term has rendered an effective field theory renormalizable . </S>",
    "<S> the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation is the mass of these higgs scalars . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that their mass respects , and can even saturate , the model - independent upper bound on the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these two models demonstrate that @xmath57 , the inverse coefficient of the dimension - five term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dim5 ] ) , is the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation . if one integrates out the heavy majorana neutrino in the see - saw model , one obtains this dimension - five term , with @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> the same thing happens if one integrates out the higgs triplet . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is equal to the scale at which new physics appears , and @xmath59 is a dimensionless product of coupling constants and mass ratios . these models can naturally saturate our bound , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) , precisely because they generate a majorana - neutrino mass term of dimension five in the low - energy theory .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8.6 cm    neutrino oscillation experiments do not measure the neutrino mass , but rather the absolute value of the mass - squared difference of two species of neutrinos , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a lower bound of @xmath61 on the mass of one of the two participating neutrino species . using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) , one finds the upper bounds on the scale @xmath43 given in table  1 for a variety of neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these upper bounds are all within a few orders of magnitude of the planck scale , @xmath62 gev , which is the scale before which quantum gravity must become relevant . </S>",
    "<S> however , only the vacuum - oscillation interpretation of the solar neutrino deficit yields a scale that could be as large as the planck scale . in all other cases , we find that the physics of majorana - neutrino mass generation must be below the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if these neutrino masses arise from quantum gravity , then the scale of quantum gravity must be somewhat less than the planck scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the upper bounds on @xmath43 are also within a few orders of magnitude of the grand - unification scale , @xmath63 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the lsnd ( liquid scintillator neutrino detector ) and atmospheric neutrino experiments yield an upper bound on @xmath43 slightly below the grand - unification scale , but the scale of majorana - neutrino mass generation could be less than the unification scale in a grand - unified model . for example , in a grand - unified model that makes use of the see - saw mechanism , the mass of the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath50 could be equal to a small yukawa coupling times the vacuum - expectation value of the higgs field that breaks the grand - unified group .    in this paper </S>",
