    "the past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of cosmological data , from the discovery of cosmological acceleration using supernovae @xcite to the precise mapping of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite to the detection of the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the early universe on galaxy clustering @xcite . combining the most recent of these three cosmological probes , @xcite detect no significant deviation from the minimal flat @xmath6cdm cosmological model with adiabatic , power law primordial fluctuations , and constrain that model s parameters to within a few percent .",
    "the broad shape of the power spectrum of density fluctuations in the evolved universe provides a probe of cosmological parameters that is highly complementary to the cmb and to probes of the expansion history ( e.g. , supernovae , bao ) .",
    "the last decade has also seen a dramatic increase in the scope of galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "the pscz @xcite contains @xmath20 iras galaxies out to @xmath21 , the 2df galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs ; @xcite ) collected 221,414 galaxy redshifts with median redshift 0.11 , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) is now complete with 929,555 galaxy spectra @xcite including both main galaxies ( @xmath22 ; @xcite ) and luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; @xmath23 ; @xcite ) . to harness the improvement in statistical power available now from these surveys",
    "requires stringent understanding of modeling uncertainties .",
    "the three major components of this uncertainty are the non - linear gravitational evolution of the matter density field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the relationship between the galaxy and underlying matter density fields ( `` galaxy bias '' , e.g. , @xcite ) , and redshift space distortions ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "several major advances have enabled previous analyses of 2dfgrs and sdss to begin to address these complications .",
    "progress in @xmath24-body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , analytical methods ( see @xcite for an overview and comparison of many recent methods ) , and combinations thereof ( e.g. , @xcite ) have allowed significant progress in the study of the non - linear real space matter power spectrum .",
    "recent power spectrum analyses have accounted for the luminosity dependence of a scale independent galaxy bias @xcite , which can introduce an artificial tilt in @xmath25 in surveys which are not volume - limited @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently examined the scale dependence of galaxy bias as a function of luminosity and color .",
    "@xcite applied a matrix - based method using pseudo - karhunen - love eigenmodes to measure three power spectra from the sdss galaxy distribution , allowing a quantification of the clustering anisotropy and a more accurate reconstruction of the real - space power spectrum than can be obtained from the angle - averaged redshift space power spectrum .",
    "non - linear redshift space distortions , caused in part by the virialized motions of galaxies in their host dark matter haloes , create features known as fingers - of - god ( fogs ) along the line of sight in the redshift space galaxy density field @xcite . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "apply cluster - collapsing algorithms to mitigate the effects of fogs before computing power spectra .",
    "previous analyses have fit galaxy power spectra to linear @xcite or non - linear matter models @xcite , but did not attempt to model the scale dependence of the galaxy bias . @xcite introduced a phenomenological model to account for both matter non - linearity and the non - trivial relation between the galaxy power spectrum @xmath26 and matter power spectrum : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the underlying linear matter power spectrum .",
    "for the 2dfgrs analysis , @xcite fit @xmath29 using mock galaxy catalogues and derive expected central values of @xmath30 . in the fit to the observed galaxy power spectrum , they allow @xmath30 to vary up to twice the expected value , which is supported by halo model calculations of the cosmological dependence of the galaxy @xmath25 . this approach appears to work well for the case of 2dfgrs galaxies because it was calibrated on mock catalogues designed to match the properties of this galaxy population ; however , its application to the lrg sample in @xcite , where the best - fitting @xmath30 was much larger than for 2dfgrs galaxies , is questionable ( see @xcite and @xcite , but also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus our efforts on accurately modeling the relationship between the galaxy and matter density fields for the sdss lrg sample .",
    "several authors have studied this relation using the small and intermediate scale clustering in the sdss lrg sample @xcite and galaxy - galaxy lensing @xcite .",
    "the lrg selection algorithm in the sdss @xcite was designed to provide a homogenous galaxy sample probing a large volume with a number density , @xmath31 , which maximizes the effective survey volume @xmath32 on the large scales of interest , @xmath33 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath34 is given by @xcite : @xmath35 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the measured galaxy power spectrum , @xmath36 the average galaxy number density in the sample at position @xmath37 , and the integral is over the survey volume .",
    "the total error on @xmath25 is minimized ( i.e. , @xmath34 is maximized ) when @xmath38 , which optimally balances cosmic variance and shot noise for a fixed number of galaxies .",
    "the lrg sample has proven its statistical power through the detection of the bao @xcite . however , parameterizing the lrg power spectrum with a heuristic model for the non - linearity ( eqn .",
    "[ qeqn ] ) and marginalizing over fitting parameters limits our ability to extract the full cosmological information available from the power spectrum shape and can introduce systematic biases @xcite .    on sufficiently large scales ,",
    "we expect galaxies to be linearly biased with respect to the underlying matter density field @xcite .",
    "however , an often overlooked consequence of a sample with @xmath39 is that errors in the treatment of the shot noise can introduce significant changes in the measured shape of @xmath40 and can be interpreted as a scale dependent galaxy bias . in the halo model picture , the lrgs occupy massive dark matter haloes , which themselves may not be poisson tracers of the underlying matter density field , as they form at the high peaks of the initial gaussian density distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , an additional shot noise - like term is generated when multiple lrgs occupy individual dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "our approach is to first eliminate the one - halo contribution to the power spectrum by identifying groups of galaxies occupying the same dark matter halo , and then to calibrate the relation between the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field , @xmath41 , and the underlying matter power spectrum , @xmath42 , using the @xmath24-body simulation results presented in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the effects of non - linear redshift space distortions caused by pairs of galaxies occupying the same halo are diminished . however",
    ", a further complication is that lrgs occupy the massive end of the halo mass function , and velocities of isolated lrgs within their host haloes could still be quite large .",
    "the details of the relation between lrgs and the underlying matter distribution can then have a significant impact on the non - linear corrections to the power spectrum .",
    "the dr7 lrg sample has sufficient statistical power that the details of the relation between lrgs and the underlying matter density field become important and need to be reliably modeled before attempting a cosmological interpretation of the data .",
    "this paper offers three sequential key improvements to the modeling of lrg clustering compared with @xcite and @xcite :    * we reconstruct the underlying halo density field traced by the lrgs before computing the power spectrum , while @xcite apply an aggressive fog compression algorithm .",
    "the reconstructed halo density field power spectrum deviates from the underlying matter power spectrum by @xmath43 at @xmath44 , while the @xcite power spectrum differs by @xmath45 at @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "* we produce a large set of mock lrg catalogues drawn from @xmath24-body simulations of sufficient resolution to trace a halo mass range relevant to lrgs without significant errors in the small - scale halo clustering and velocity statistics ( see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "we present novel consistency checks between the mock and observed lrg density fields in halo - scale higher order clustering , fog features , and the effective shot noise .",
    "* we use these tests along with the halo model framework to determine tight bounds on the remaining modeling uncertainties , and marginalize over these in our likelihood calculation .",
    "in contrast , @xcite assume no uncertainty in their model lrg correlation function , and @xcite marginalize over @xmath30 in eqn .",
    "[ qeqn ] with only an extremely weak prior on @xmath30 .",
    "this paper represents a first attempt to analyse a galaxy redshift survey with a model that accounts for the non - linear galaxy bias and its uncertainty ; other approaches that utilize the galaxy distribution rather than the halo density field are in development @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we compute the line of sight separation of galaxies in the same cic group as a probe of the accuracy of our model galaxy velocities at the high halo mass end , where there is more than one lrg per halo .",
    "the comparison is complicated by the presence of fiber collision corrected galaxies , since their redshifts are artificially set to that of another galaxy in their group .",
    "we discard all such groups , and discard an equal fraction at each @xmath46 in our mock sample .",
    "the resulting distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : foghist ] .",
    "the fiducial mocks with no central galaxy velocity dispersion appear to fit the data better , though neither matches the observed sharpness of the rise at small separations .",
    "note that the fiducial mock catalogues with no velocity dispersion are determined only by the observed @xmath47 ; no free parameters have been adjusted to match the observed velocity distribution .",
    "this comparison indicates that the residual fog features in the reconstructed observed and mock halo density fields will be in satisfactory agreement .",
    "in this subsection we examine the difference between the observed redshift space monopole spectrum @xmath49 ( no density field preprocessing of fog features ) and the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field , @xmath48 , and compare with our mock galaxy catalogues .",
    "this comparison provides an additional consistency check between the mock and observed lrg catalogues , and quantifies the effect of the halo density field reconstruction step on the measured power spectrum shape .",
    "we consider @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant that parametrizes the enhancement of the overall bias when satellite galaxies are included , since they occupy the most highly biased regions . in real space on large scales , @xmath52 would be a simple shot noise , but in redshift space we expect the detailed @xmath52 to result from the transfer of power between scales caused by the fogs , making @xmath52 dependent on the underlying power spectrum shape .",
    "we will ignore this possible @xmath53 level modification to the expected @xmath52 since we have demonstrated good agreement between the shape of the mock and observed halo power spectra .",
    "the lower short dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cccompare ] shows the predicted @xmath52 from our mock catalogues , the upper short dashed curve shows the predicted @xmath52 scaled by a factor of 1.5 , and the solid curve shows @xmath52 for the observed spectra .",
    "the observed @xmath52 is clearly shallower than the predicted shape .",
    "a crucial difference between the observed and mock lrg density fields is the application of fiber collision corrections discussed in section  [ sampleselection ] in the observed density field .",
    "2158 galaxies without spectra were added to the lrg sample and assigned the redshift of the nearest lrg , while the cic group multiplicity results in table  [ table : ciccompare ] indicate that 6857 galaxies are ` satellite ' galaxies .",
    "first , since @xmath54 of the fiber - collision corrections are erroneous @xcite , we expect an additional shot noise of @xmath55 mpc)@xmath56 from these galaxies , which are not represented in our mock catalogues .",
    "second , the fiber collision corrected galaxies that are physically associated with a neighboring lrg will change the distribution of @xmath52 relative to the mocks because their line of sight separation from the neighboring galaxy has been eliminated . the long dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : cccompare ] shows that we can match the observed @xmath52 as a sum of the mock catalogue @xmath52 and a shot noise of @xmath57 mpc)@xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath52 for the observed spectra is consistent with a constant power for @xmath58 and amounts to a significant difference between the two spectra : @xmath59 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , differences in the preprocessing of the lrg density field can lead to changes in @xmath25 much larger than the statistical errors on the measurements , which could then be propagated to errors in the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "note that the reconstructed halo density field is basically unaffected by errors in the close - pair fiber collision correction applied to the data , since these galaxies are all assigned to haloes containing other lrgs already .    in summary",
    ", the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be understood once we account for the effects of fiber collisions , and the model predictions @xmath41 are robust to any uncertainty associated with these effects .",
    "a further subtle difference between the mock and observed halo power spectrum is that the mock catalogues were evaluated using a redshift snapshot with constant @xmath31 , and luminosities were not assigned to the mock lrgs ; each reconstructed halo is weighted equally when computing the overdensity field . to verify that the luminosity weighting used to compute the @xmath48 does not significantly alter the relative amplitude of the shot noise to total power compared with our mock catalogues , we recompute @xmath48 from the data with luminosity - independent weights from @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig : nolumbiasrat ] shows the ratio of the observed spectra with our fiducial weights compared with the luminosity - independent weights .",
    "the good agreement even at large @xmath64 where the power is small indicates there is no significant difference from the shot noise subtraction between these two weightings ; we find no statistically significant change in the power spectrum shape .",
    "moreover , the change in the windowed theory power spectrum due to the change in weights is negligible ( @xmath65 ) , indicating that the window function will not be sensitive to the particular weighting choices of section  [ data ] for reconstructed haloes containing more than one galaxy . while the luminosity - weighting is critical for the sdss main sample @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig : nzcompare ] shows that the lrgs are close to volume - limited over much of the redshift range of the sample ; it is therefore unsurprising that the @xcite and @xcite weighting schemes produce nearly identical power spectra for the lrg sample .",
    "our model uses halofit to describe the cosmological parameter dependence of the non - linearity in the matter power spectrum , and is calibrated from @xmath24-body simulations at the fiducial cosmology ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : dm_model ] ) .",
    "below @xmath60 , the dark matter power spectrum is linear at the 1% level , apart from the bao damping , and it is only @xmath66 larger than the linear one at @xmath44 . using the publicly available wmap5 @xmath6cdm mcmc chain , we find @xmath67 changes by @xmath68 for @xmath69 in the space of cosmologies allowed by the wmap5 data alone ; the error on this small correction will therefore be well below 1% .",
    "therefore we expect the model of the non - linear matter power spectrum to be accurate at the @xmath70 level at @xmath60 and @xmath71 at @xmath44 .",
    "we use the lrg catalogues from @xcite evaluated at the wmap3 preferred cosmological parameters @xmath72 at @xmath73 with @xmath74 gpc to test the cosmological dependence of our model @xmath41 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : dm_model ] .",
    "we plot a mock catalogue power spectrum @xmath75 against our @xmath41 model predictions for a near subsample in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmap3fit ] to demonstrate the agreement both in the bao features and overall shape of the deviation out to @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 for 86 dof ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 for 31 dof ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this provides further evidence that the cosmological dependence of our model @xmath41 is sufficiently accurate for the sdss dr7 data , which probe a somewhat smaller volume .",
    "in section [ quantnuis ] we established that the largest remaining known source of systematic uncertainty is the central galaxy velocity dispersion . to test the impact of this uncertainty on the cosmological constraints , we reevaluate the @xmath48 likelihood surface using the ` extreme ' velocity dispersion model in appendix [ galaxiesinhaloes ] to calibrate the model @xmath81 .",
    "the maximum likelihood points for the fiducial , no velocity dispersion model ( cross ) and the ` extreme ' velocity dispersion model ( x ) are shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dr7onlynuis ] .",
    "the systematic shift in the contours between the zero and extreme central velocity dispersion model is small compared to the width of the @xmath82 constraint ( dotted curve ) .",
    "when we marginalize over nuisance parameters @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , @xmath85 between the maximum likelihood model values for the zero and extreme velocity dispersion models is @xmath86 .",
    "if one instead adopts the @xmath87 , @xmath84 , and @xmath88 values which minimize @xmath89 , the shift decreases to @xmath90 ; the difference is because the preferred nuisance parameters @xmath87 and @xmath84 in the no velocity dispersion model are closer to the boundary of the allowed values .",
    "these @xmath85 values are approximately the same when considering a fit to the model with or without bao wiggles .",
    "this shift is small compared to the statistical errors , and since the velocity dispersion model considered is extreme compared with the available estimates in the literature @xcite , we can safely neglect this systematic uncertainty in the present analysis .    within our fiducial nuisance parameter bounds and using our fiducial model with no central galaxy velocity dispersion , we have verified that the effect of the nuisance parameters in eqn .",
    "[ eq : nuis ] is small on the @xmath48 cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "the preferred nuisance parameters are off - center in the allowed @xmath91 space , although not at the boundary : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where we have computed a likelihood - weighted average over the dr7-only constraints . the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dr7onlynuis ] shows @xmath94 and 9.3 contours where @xmath95 and @xmath88 is varied to minimize @xmath89 ( dashed contours ) compared to our fiducial marginalization over @xmath88 , @xmath87 and @xmath84 ( solid contours ) .",
    "allowing nuisance parameters to account for our imperfect modeling induces both a small shift and widening of the likelihood surface .",
    "the difference in the contours is negligible when @xmath89 is evaluated instead at the values @xmath87 and @xmath84 that minimize @xmath89 .",
    "therefore the hard boundary we impose in @xmath91 space does not seriously affect the likelihood contours , and @xmath87 and @xmath84 are not strongly degenerate with the cosmological parameters constrained by @xmath48 when @xmath87 and @xmath84 are tightly constrained by the arguments in section [ getmaxnuisvals ] .",
    "however , when one substantially relaxes the constraints on the nuisance function , the constraints from the power spectrum shape degrade .",
    "the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dr7onlynuis ] shows how the @xmath96 , and 9.3 constraints relax when @xmath87 and @xmath84 are chosen to minimize @xmath89 such that @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "while the constraints on @xmath99 are unchanged , the shape information is degraded .",
    "the effects of scale dependent halo bias are well below these allowed deviations @xcite , and we have argued that our reconstruction of the halo density field should leave much smaller uncertainties as well .",
    "the dashed contours in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dr7onlynuis ] show a further broadening of the constraints when @xmath87 and @xmath84 are varied without restriction to minimize @xmath89 . for comparison with the adopted nuisance restrictions , the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dr7onlynuis ] also shows the regions where the best - fitting nuisance parameters satisfy @xmath100 ( solid lines ) and @xmath101 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the width of this region is smaller than the statistical errors derived from the shape constraint , which are shown in the upper left panel .",
    "consequently , it is unsurprising that our marginalized likelihood contours with the fiducial nuisance restrictions deviate only slightly from the contours where @xmath95 .",
    "finally we note that for the models with and without velocity dispersion , the likelihood - weighted best - fitting nuisance functions have small deviations from one at @xmath60 ( @xmath102 ) , the region containing most of the shape information .",
    "the two models differ in the quasi - linear regime : @xmath103 for the velocity dispersion model and 0.060 without velocity dispersion . however , we can not distinguish between velocity dispersion and other modeling uncertainties to explain the shape of the nuisance function preferred by the data .",
    "moreover , using the velocity dispersion model does not improve the overall @xmath89 of the fit ."
