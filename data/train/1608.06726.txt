    "the generating functions of gromov - witten invariants ( gw potentials in short ) on 1-dimensional calabi - yau orbifolds were shown to be quasi - modular forms ( or their generalizations for some higher dimensional calabi - yau ) .",
    "for example milanov - ruan @xcite proved the quasi - modularity for elliptic orbifold projective lines @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and later shen and zhou @xcite proved it for all one - dimensional compact calabi - yau that includes @xmath7 .",
    "( see also @xcite for the modularity of open gw potentials of these orbifolds . )",
    "it draws our attention that one can observe a number theoretic phenomenon in the curve counting problem for elliptic orbifolds , and this paper as well as our preceding work @xcite aims to see this more straightforwardly . in @xcite ,",
    "we studied classification of holomorphic orbi - spheres which contribute to ( small ) quantum product of three elliptic orbifold projective lines @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "while the full gw potentials had previously been computed making use of algebraic techniques such as wdvv - equations ( see @xcite for potentials of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 for all genera , and @xcite for genus-0 potentials of @xmath4 and @xmath7 ) , our method in @xcite was based on elementary counting so that it reveals more directly a combinatorial feature of the gw invariants for those elliptic orbifolds .",
    "interestingly , there is a correspondence between those invariants ( 3-point correlators in gromov - witten invariants ) and the number of integer solutions of certain quadratic diophantine equations .",
    "consequently , we were able to show that the structure constants for quantum products for @xmath8 and @xmath6 are theta functions in khler parameter @xmath9 , which directly implies their modularities .    in this short article , we classify holomorphic orbi - spheres in @xmath7 applying the similar technique as in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our goal is not to compute the gw potential itself , but rather , to examine an elementary , yet more geometric technique to count holomorphic spheres that contribute to the gw potential .",
    "we will see that the counting problem reduces to a simple combinatorial question , that is finding the number of integer solutions for certain equations .",
    "the main difference from the previous work @xcite is as follows . as we were only interested in 3-point correlators ( for quantum products ) in @xcite , we fixed the complex structure of the domain orbifold riemann surface using equivalence of stable maps ( by fixing the position of three orbifold singular points of the domain ) . on the other hand , the domain orbifolds in the case of @xmath7",
    "are orbi - spheres with four cone - type singularities of order @xmath10 equipped with a complex structure , and there is a family of such domains which are not bi - holomorphic to each other .",
    "in fact , the moduli space of the domain orbifolds is isomorphic to the moduli of elliptic curves , which can be described in terms of @xmath11-lattices in @xmath12 .    combining this description of the moduli of domains and the lifting theory of _ orbi - map_s to universal covering spaces of @xmath7 ( which is simply @xmath12 )",
    ", we shall prove that the curve - counting problem is again equivalent to finding the number of integer solutions ( up to gauge ) of some quadratic equation .",
    "here is our main theorem in this paper .    the 4-point non - zero degree @xmath2 orbifold gromov - witten invariant of @xmath7 is the count of integer solutions @xmath13 of @xmath14 up to the linear action of @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the number of solutions of the above equation only gives the sum of all contributions to the gromov - witten invariants with fixed degree @xmath2 , but the precise gromov - witten invariant can be easily deduced from this after elementary combinatorics to be made in section [ sec : computation ] .",
