    "the cobe - dirbe team has recently announced the detection of the cosmic far infrared background ( @xcite ) .",
    "the team interprets this flux as the sum of far infrared ( fir ) emission from all galaxies , presumably mostly reemission from warm dust ( although other interpretations have been made , _",
    "@xcite , 1991 ) .",
    "the dirbe results thus provide important constraints on the star formation history . in this letter",
    ", we use the dirbe flux measurement , in conjunction with radio wavelength observations , to explain some of the radio extragalactic surface brightness , to estimate the redshift of the sources producing the dirbe background , and to constrain radio source counts .    at 240m@xmath2  and 140m@xmath2 ,",
    "the fluxes measured by the dirbe team are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "these values are in agreement with the firas spectrum over 1252000m@xmath2  reported by fixsen  _ et  al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "we have elected to use these more recent results rather than the tentative detection reported by puget  _ et  al . _  ( 1996 ) . the hauser  _ et  al .",
    "_  measurement , and the upper limits at 60m@xmath2  and 100m@xmath2 , show that the flux density has a nearly flat spectrum , and thus we take the flux density to be @xmath5wm^-2ster^-1hz^-1@xmath6  between 140m@xmath2  and 240m@xmath2 in our subsequent calculations .",
    "we begin with the assumption that the well - established correlation between the far infrared and 20@xmath7  radio flux densities of galaxies , @xmath8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) holds for whatever sources produce the bulk of dirbe background .",
    "the relationship has been observed for galaxies with a range of @xmath9 in fir flux density , from normal spirals to ultraluminous iras galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation does not , however , hold for galaxies in which the radio emission is not associated with star formation , such as agn or classic radio galaxies .",
    "the physical origin of the correlation , while not completely understood , is probably due to star - formation processes , namely dust reemission in the far infrared , and supernova remnant synchrotron emission or thermal emission in the radio ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to suppose that the relationship holds for the higher redshift , faint galaxies producing the dirbe background .    a substantial fraction of the dirbe background , and the associated radio emission , may be redshifted .",
    "restframe emission at 80m@xmath2  from sources in the range @xmath10 would be detected by dirbe between 140m@xmath2  and 240m@xmath2 . since the luminosity density and star formation rate peak approximately in this same interval ( @xcite )",
    ", we will initially take @xmath11 as a typical redshift for the sources producing the dirbe background .",
    "thus the radio flux emitted by these sources at 20@xmath7  ( 1.4  ghz ) will be observed at 40@xmath7  ( 750  mhz ) .    using the fir - radio correlation",
    ", we calculate that the surface brightness at 40@xmath7  due to star - forming galaxies is @xmath12  jy / ster , or about 0.5  mjy / amin@xmath13 .",
    "the asterisk is used to indicate emission from star - forming galaxies ( i.e. , emission from agn and the cmb is not included ) .",
    "the corresponding brightness temperature is @xmath14  k.    to compare this to the observed brightness temperature , we scale this result to other radio bands using an appropriate spectral index @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 ) for the source population .",
    "windhorst  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1993 ) compiled various surveys of faint radio sources at 50@xmath7  ( 600  mhz ) and 75@xmath7  ( 400  mhz ) , and found the median spectral index between these bands and 6@xmath7  ( 5  ghz ) to be @xmath17 for faint sources , a value we will assume unless noted .",
    "thus , the brightness temperature at 170@xmath7  ( 178  mhz ) due to the dirbe sources is @xmath18  k.    we may compare this prediction with the observations of bridle ( 1967 ) , who found @xmath19  k for the entire extragalactic brightness temperature , including emission from agn and 2.728  k from the cosmic microwave background ( @xcite ) .",
    "subtracting the temperature of the cmb , we see that source of the dirbe background explains more than half of the observed radio sky brightness due to all extragalactic sources .",
    "if we adopt a flatter spectral index for the radio sources of @xmath20 , the fraction of the observed radio background explained by the dirbe sources drops to about a third .",
    "thus the simple assumption that the fir - radio correlation holds for the dirbe sources allows us to explain a significant fraction of the observed radio brightness of the sky .",
    "our results are consistent with observations at other radio bands , which show that about half of the extragalactic radio background is due to star - forming galaxies . for instance , condon  ( 1989 ) estimates that at 20@xmath7 , agn and star - forming galaxies contribute almost equally to the total spectral power density .",
    "an analysis of radio source counts allows us to reinforce this conclusion .",
    "the counts are the sum of the two populations ( star - forming galaxies and agn ) , with the bulk of the agn brighter than the bulk of the star - forming galaxies ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite )",
    ". we can thus take all the bright sources as a proxy for agn , and then estimate the total fraction of the surface brightness of the radio sky that agn would contribute . at 20@xmath7 , the dividing line between the two populations has been estimated as 1  mjy ( @xcite ) and 9  mjy ( @xcite ) .",
    "ryle  ( 1968 ) uses a lower limit of 10  mjy at 75@xmath7(which corresponds to 4  mjy at 20@xmath7  for @xmath21 ) , and integrates over @xmath22 to find @xmath23  k for the contribution to the background from agn",
    ". we can compare this to the total radio background by scaling bridle s 1967 measurement at 170@xmath7  and correcting for the cmb contribution to find @xmath24  k for the total radio brightness .",
    "thus , the agn explain about half of the total radio background , leaving the other half due to star - forming systems .    since observations at other radio bands have also found that about half of the extragalactic radio background is produced by star - forming galaxies , we conclude that the assumed fir - radio correlation holds for the sources responsible for the dirbe background .",
    "since the tight fir - radio correlation seen in individually observed galaxies at lower redshift is ascribed to star formation , our results bolster the argument that star formation is the cause of most of the fir background at the presumably higher redshifts of the dirbe sources .",
    "we have so far assumed that both the fir and the radio flux are produced at @xmath25 .",
    "if the bulk of the emission originates at a different redshift , we will need to make the appropriate k - corrections .",
    "it is convenient that the dirbe measurements and limits have found the fir background to have a flat spectrum between 140 and 240m@xmath2  ( see  1 ) , so that to first order we can ignore the fir k - corrections in the range @xmath10 for 80m@xmath2  emission . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the spectral index must be used to make the k - corrections .    to find the redshift of the dirbe sources",
    ", we once again assume the fir - radio correlation .",
    "we then scale the radio emission to an observing wavelength of 170@xmath7 , and write @xmath26 as the fraction @xmath27 of the observed flux density which we ascribe to star - forming galaxies , giving @xmath28 solving this expression for the redshift , and substituting in the measured values of @xmath29 ( see  2 ) and @xmath30 ( see  1 ) , we find the dimensionless relationship @xmath31 which is plotted in figure  1 .    for our nominal values of @xmath32 and @xmath21 , we find @xmath33 , in agreement with our initial assumption of @xmath34 . while the uncertainty is large , this value is in agreement with the redshift of peak star formation of @xmath35 found by madau  _ et  al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the measured redshifts of individual faint radio galaxies ( less than 1  mjy ) are typically @xmath36 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; our value of @xmath37 is somewhat higher than this estimate , but this is reasonable since the fainter galaxies making up the dirbe background should be at higher redshifts than brighter galaxies detected individually .",
    "let us now assume reasonable values of @xmath37 and @xmath15 and consider the allowable range of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "we can assume that the bulk of star formation is certainly more recent than the epoch corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "then figure  1 shows that the fraction of the radio background from star forming galaxies , @xmath26 , must be greater than 20% for any reasonable spectral index .",
    "since @xmath37 must be greater than zero , we can also find upper limits on @xmath26 : for @xmath21 , @xmath26 must be less than about 90% , and for @xmath20 , less than 50% . if star formation peaks in the interval @xmath39 and @xmath17 , @xmath26 is tightly constrained to the interval 40 - 60% .",
    "the brightness temperature of the radio background , corrected for the cmb , is due to combined flux of the faint radio galaxies and thus is related to the number counts of these galaxies , @xmath40 we can take the number counts to be of the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is generally less than @xmath43 for this population at radio wavelengths ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq.dnds ] ] ) . for @xmath44 ,",
    "faint sources dominate the contribution to the background temperature .",
    "it has also long been recognized that , for @xmath44 , the total source counts and the radio sky brightness will ( slowly ) diverge as @xmath45 ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , there must be a cutoff or change in slope of the @xmath0 curve at some minimum value , @xmath46 . to estimate @xmath46  we can use the radio brightness temperature due to the dirbe star - forming galaxies in conjunction with the @xmath47 relation for faint radio sources .",
    "very deep vla observations at 3.6@xmath7  ( 8  ghz ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have been used to determine the number count power law , @xmath48 which is valid for flux densities in the range @xmath49 . at these faint flux levels",
    ", there is little contamination from agn , i.e. the sources are nearly all star forming galaxies ( @xcite ) . for @xmath44 , the definite integral is dominated by @xmath46  and is independent of @xmath50  for large values of @xmath50 ; we take @xmath50  to be infinity . thus , the integral over these number counts will yield the radio brightness temperature due to the dirbe sources found above .",
    "scaling this temperature to 3.6@xmath7 , integrating , and solving for @xmath46 , we find @xmath51^{\\frac{1}{2+\\gamma}}. \\label{eq.smin}\\ ] ] for @xmath21 , @xmath11 , the observed value of @xmath30 , and @xmath42 and @xmath52 from equation  ( [ eq.dnds ] ) , we find @xmath53 at 3.6@xmath7 .",
    "it is useful to compare our estimate of @xmath46 , based on the far infrared background , with other estimates at 3.6@xmath7 , such as those made by windhorst  _ et  al . _  ( 1993 ) . in order for the radio background due to galaxies to not distort the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , they found @xmath54  njy at 3.6@xmath7",
    ". they also found that if @xmath46  fell below 300  njy , the optical counterparts of these faint radio sources would exceed the v band counts of field galaxies .",
    "the limit of @xmath55jy@xmath1  we have found is consistent with these , but more restrictive , and has more interesting observational consequences .    an rms sensitivity of 1.5jy@xmath1  has been reached in recent vla observations at 3.6@xmath7  ( @xcite ) , and our value of @xmath46indicates that there are few radio sources below this flux density , that is , the slope of the @xmath0 curve changes significantly at @xmath46 .",
    "the present vla observations have thus detected the bulk of all radio sources in the universe .",
    "the value of @xmath46  ( at @xmath56 ) can also be compared to the knee in the luminosity function for _ local _ faint radio sources . at 20@xmath7 ,",
    "the slope turns over around @xmath57  w / hz ( @xcite ) . a source at @xmath34 with a flux density of 1jy@xmath1  at 3.6@xmath7",
    "would have a 20@xmath7  luminosity of about @xmath58  w / hz ( assuming @xmath21 and an einstein - desitter universe ) .",
    "thus , the turnover point at @xmath34 is very similar to the local value , especially for a hubble parameter of @xmath59 .",
    "we can also consider the fluctuations in the radio background due to these sources .",
    "the number counts ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq.dnds ] ] ) at the 1jy@xmath1level indicate that there should be about 25 sources per armin@xmath13 , or about @xmath60  sources / steradian .",
    "the average separation of 1jy@xmath1  sources is thus about 14@xmath61 , and we would expect substantial fluctuation in the surface brightness of the radio sky on this angular scale .",
    "the rms due to the sources can in principle be calculated from the number counts , assuming the sources are distributed randomly on the sky .",
    "when the number counts follow a power law distribution , as in equation  ( [ eq.dnds ] ) , the rms is determined by the upper and lower limits on the source flux densities , @xmath46  and @xmath50 . for a power law with @xmath62 , the rms is unfortunately dominated by the value of @xmath50 , which is not well known for this population ( the bright star - forming galaxies are comparable to the faint agn , making it difficult to determine the precise upper bound on the population ) .",
    "thus , it goes beyond the scope of this paper to estimate the rms in the radio background due to this population .",
    "we concur , however , with the conclusions of partridge  _ et  al . _  ( 1997 ) and mitchell &  condon  ( 1985 ) , that these faint radio sources do contribute substantially to the rms fluctuations in the microwave sky .",
    "others have noted that at the higher frequencies and lower angular resolutions planned for satellite- and ground - based searches for cmb fluctuations , the faint sources that produce the fir background should present no problems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , unless the sources are strongly clustered .",
    "we can also ask how these sources will appear in number counts and high resolution maps in the far infrared . for @xmath15 between 0.4 and 0.7 , and @xmath34 , we use the fir - radio correlation to calculate that 3.6@xmath7  sources with flux density @xmath46  ( 1jy@xmath1 ) will appear as 600 - 1200jy@xmath1  sources at 160m@xmath2 .",
    "the number density of these faint fir sources can be compared to the semi - analytic models of galaxy formation of guiderdoni  _ et  al . _  ( 1998 ) , who predict the fir background and the faint galaxy counts for various fir wavelengths .",
    "one of their models finds a number density of 10@xmath63  sources / steradian for 1  mjy sources at 175m@xmath2 , which is close to our estimate of @xmath60 sources / steradian . at 160m@xmath2 , the longest sirtf - mips wavelength",
    ", sirtf will have 15@xmath61 pixels and an angular resolution of about 30@xmath61 ( @xcite ) , larger than the average separation of 14@xmath61 between the faintest sources .",
    "thus , sirtf will not be able to resolve the individual sources responsible for the dirbe flux , and will be confusion limited .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the monte carlo simulations of rieke  _ et  al . _  ( 1996 ) ,",
    "who find a confusion limit for sirtf of 1500jy@xmath1 .",
    "using the well - established correlation between the fir and radio luminosity of individual galaxies , we have extrapolated the fir background detected by dirbe to radio wavelengths .",
    "this has allowed us to derive several properties of the sources making up the fir background :    1 .",
    "the radio emission from the sources makes up about half of the observed extragalactic radio background ( about 0.3  k at wavelengths around 40@xmath7 , excluding the cosmic microwave background ) .",
    "2 .   since this finding is in agreement with other radio observations , the fir - radio correlation holds even for the very faint sources making up the dirbe background .",
    "this implies that the fir background between about 140 and 240m@xmath2  is dominated by star - formation , not agn activity .",
    "the typical redshift and spectral index @xmath15 of these sources , and the contribution they make to the radio background are related by equation  ( [ eq.azalpha ] ) . for reasonable values of the spectral index ( 0.4 to 0.7 ) and the fraction of the radio background ( 40 - 60% )",
    ", we find the redshift of these sources to be roughly between 1 and 2 , in agreement with the madau  _ et  al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) estimate of the redshift of peak star formation .",
    "4 .   by extrapolating the radio @xmath0 curve at 3.6@xmath7  to fainter flux densities",
    ", we estimate that most of the dirbe flux is produced by sources whose 3.6@xmath7  flux density is @xmath64jy@xmath1 , and that the number density of 1jy@xmath1  sources is about @xmath65 .",
    "these sources will cause sirtf to be confusion limited around 160m@xmath2 ."
