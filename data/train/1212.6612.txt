    "the unexpected dimming of type ia supernova ( sne ia ) is thought to be the evidence of acceleration of the universe @xcite . in the frame of general relativity ( gr ) ,",
    "the most famous explanation is the existence of dark energy with a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "however , there are some issues on this plausible mechanism for observed sne ia dimming .",
    "the photon number conservation may be deviated .",
    "for example , it is due to the dust in our galaxy and oscillation of photons propagating in extragalactic magnetic fields into very light axions .",
    "these absorption , scattering or axion - photon mixing may lead to dimming @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms are widely proposed including modified gravity @xcite , dissipative processes @xcite , evolutionary effects in sne ia events @xcite , violation of cosmological principle @xcite and so on . on the other hand , the deviation of photon number conservation is related to the correction of tolman test @xcite which is equivalent to measurements of the well - known distance - duality relation ( ddr ) @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is luminosity distance , @xmath5 is angular diameter distance and @xmath6 is redshift .",
    "the ddr is in fact a particular form of presenting the general theorem proved by etherington known as the `` reciprocity law '' or `` etherington reciprocity theorem '' .",
    "ddr holds for general metric theories of gravity in any cosmic background and it is valid for any cosmological models based on the riemannian geometry .",
    "it is independent of gravity equation and the universe components .",
    "however , ddr may be not valid in the case that photons do not travel along null geodesics or the cosmic opacity exists .",
    "many efforts have been done to test ddr though astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "usually , they assume the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "compared to conservation of photon number , the assumptions that the mathematical tool used to describe the space - time of universe is riemannian geometry and photon travels along null geodesic are more fundamental and unassailable , thus the deviation of ddr most possibly indicates cosmic absorption . in this case , the flux received by the observer will be reduced by a factor @xmath10 , and observed luminosity distance can be obtained by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the optical depth related to the cosmic absorption .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is @xmath14 @xcite . following this assumption , avgoustidis et al .",
    "@xcite studied the difference between sne ia observations and hubble parameter data . @xmath0",
    "data are mainly obtained through the measurements of differential ages of red - envelope galaxies known as `` differential age method '' .",
    "the aging of stars can be regarded as an indicator of the aging of the universe .",
    "the spectra of stars can be converted to the information of their ages , as the evolutions of stars are well known .",
    "since the stars can not be observed one by one at cosmological scales , people usually take the spectra of galaxies which contain relatively uniform star population .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 data can be obtained from the bao scale as a standard ruler in the radial direction known as `` peak method '' .",
    "these methods are apparently independent of galaxy luminosity so that it will not be affected by cosmic opacity .",
    "however , sne ia observations are affected by many sources of opacity , such as the hosting galaxy , intervening galaxies , intergalactic medium , the milky way and exotic physics which affect photon conservation . under the assumption @xmath15 , they investigated the cosmic opacity by confronting the standard luminosity distance in spatially flat @xmath16cdm model with the observed one from sne ia observations . combining with the @xmath0 data , which is not affected by transparency but yields constraints on @xmath17 , and marginalizing over all other parameters except @xmath18",
    ", they got @xmath19",
    "( 2@xmath20 ) . noticing that their method depends on cosmological models , holanda et al .",
    "@xcite further proposed a model - independent estimate of @xmath21 which are obtained from a numerical integration of @xmath0 data .",
    "they also explored the influence of different sne ia light - curve fitters ( salt2 and mlcs2k2 ) and found a significant conflict . based on holanda et al . , we proposed three model - independent methods that are different from theirs to explore the cosmic opacity .",
    "they firstly got the luminosity distances from @xmath0 data ( 12 data ) at corresponding redshifts ( at @xmath0 data ) and gave a polynomial fit based on these 12 luminosity distances data with their errors , then calculated the values at the redshifts corresponding to sne ia through this polynomial fit curve . on the contrary , we use sne ia data to get the luminosity distances at the redshifts corresponding to @xmath0 data through interpolation method , smoothing method and nearby sne ia method .",
    "our data sets contains 28 available @xmath0 data and the largest sne ia samples union2.1 @xcite .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the method of obtaining luminosity distance from @xmath0 data . in section 3 , we give the three methods that can convert sne ia luminosity distances to the luminosity distances at the redshifts corresponding to @xmath0 data . in section 4 , the results are performed .",
    "finally , we make a conclusion in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the method proposed by holanda et al . @xcite .",
    "the expression of the hubble parameter can be written in this form @xmath22 which depends on the differential age as a function of redshift .",
