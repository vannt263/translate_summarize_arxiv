    "is a large h@xmath1 filamentary nebula which is located at @xmath2 with an angular diameter of @xmath3250@xmath4 . based on its optical appearance as well as the size and thickness of the filament",
    ", @xcite suggested that is an old supernova remnant ( snr ) . from d2 absorption line analysis for seven b - type stars in the line - of - sight toward ,",
    "@xcite estimated the distance to this target to be less than 200 pc and suggested that it is a fossilized snr which is coming into equilibrium with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) . using the h@xmath1 profiles from four slit positions of the filamentary nebula , @xcite estimated the radial expansion speed to be 2535 km s@xmath5 and argued that is a remnant of sn in its momentum conserving phase , based on the kinetic energy of the shell and the far - infrared flux densities obtained from the _ iras _ data .",
    "a spectroscopic study of confirmed that the optical emission is produced by the interaction of the shock wave of an snr with the ambient ism @xcite .    on the other hand , @xcite argued that could be formed as a result of the strong stellar wind of the wolf - rayet ( wr ) star , ( also known as hd 156385 ) , and its massive progenitor , based on the newly discovered expanding 21 cm bubble surrounding .",
    "recently , @xcite also proposed that is associated with .",
    "based on the observations of the interstellar d1 & d2 absorption lines of seven early - type stars as well as the @xmath61304 absorption lines of four stars in the line - of - sight toward , they argued that the absorption components are caused by the expanding stellar wind - blown bubble associated with while the optical emission arises in a shocked filamentary gas associated with the pre - existing evolved snr cavity , which was probably formed by the high - mass progenitor of the present wr star .",
    "if the association between and really exists , the distance to should be similar to the distance to of @xmath31.55 kpc @xcite .    as soft x - ray emission has not been detected and there has been no estimation of the spectral index of the radio continuum",
    ", it is difficult to determine whether is an snr or not .",
    "however , even if is an old snr from which x - ray emission is not expected , we may still see some prominent far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) emission lines if its temperature remains at @xmath710@xmath8 k , as the gas at this temperature is known to be inhabited by lithium - like c@xmath9 , n@xmath10 , and o@xmath11 ions , which have strong fuv resonance lines @xcite . especially , c@xmath9 ions can survive in a cooled gas of an old snr longer than other high - stage ions @xcite and their fuv resonance doublet is @xmath01548 , 1551 .",
    "as can be seen in table 2 of @xcite and figure 7 of @xcite , luminosity decreases much more slowly from its peak value than the x - ray luminosity as the snr evolves .",
    "according to the simulation , 0.25 kev x - ray luminosity drops to @xmath31% of its peak value during a period of @xmath32 @xmath12 10@xmath13 yr ; on the other hand , luminosity remains at @xmath310% of its peak value until 1.2 @xmath12 10@xmath14 yr .",
    "this means that emission lines from @xmath710@xmath8 k gas might be detectable for a considerable period in an old snr that has already been cooled enough so that the soft x - ray from @xmath310@xmath13 k gas is too weak to be detectable .",
    "c@xmath9 ions can also be made by 48 ev photons from massive stars .",
    "however , the global morphology of the resulting map can be considerably different from that of snr origin .    in this paper , we present the detection of the @xmath01548 , 1551 emission line for the region of using the data of the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( fims ) , also known as spectroscopy of plasma evolution from astrophysical radiation ( spear ) .",
    "we found an enhanced region , which is closely associated with one of the h@xmath1 filamentary features of .",
    "as the fuv emission is highly extinguished by the interstellar dust , the observed intensity could constrain the distance to . in this way",
    ", we found that is much closer to us than .",
    "we also compared the and h@xmath1 features with the 21 cm morphologies using the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) data , which has a better resolution than that of the data used in @xcite .",
    "this study shows that is not associated with and is likely an old snr which has evolved non - uniformly .",
    "fims / spear is the primary payload on the first korean science and technology satellite , _ stsat-1 _ , a micro - satellite launched on 2003 september 27 .",
    "fims / spear was designed to observe large - scale diffuse fuv emission lines from the ism .",
    "fims / spear consists of dual fuv imaging spectrographs : the short wavelength channel ( s - channel ; 9001150  , 4.0@xmath15 @xmath12 4.6@xmath4 field of view ) and the long wavelength channel ( l - channel ; 13401750  , 7.4@xmath15 @xmath12 4.3@xmath4 field of view ) , with @xmath16 spectral resolution and 5@xmath4 angular resolution .",
    "the instrument , its on - orbit performance , and the basic processing of the data are described in detail in edelstein et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2000b ) .",
    "we used the l - channel data of total 116 orbits obtained in the sky survey observational mode . since our primary concern is the diffuse emission , we removed the data recorded when the count rate was high ( @xmath171000 counts s@xmath5 ) , as these events were mostly associated with observation of bright stars .",
    "the photons of these bright stars were scattered and spread over the whole field of view , dominating any diffuse emission that might exist .",
    "we eventually obtained a total of @xmath32.5 @xmath12 10@xmath8 events with an average exposure time of @xmath311.2 s for the area including .",
    "the limited attitude accuracy of the satellite was augmented by automated software correction using the positions of the bright stars listed in the _",
    "td-1 _ catalog @xcite .",
    "the positions of the reference stars were corrected to be accurate within 5@xmath4 in the present study .",
    "then , the position errors of all photons were corrected by interpolating linearly from those of the bright stars .",
    "this method is similar to that used in @xcite . to obtain images and spectra ,",
    "we have adopted the healpix scheme @xcite with the resolution parameter ` nside ` = 2048 , corresponding to a pixel size of @xmath31.72@xmath4 and 3  wavelength bins .",
    "the effects of bright stars were further reduced by masking the pixels of the elliptical region around the stars , with its major and minor axes of 25@xmath4 and 10@xmath4 , respectively , based on the scattering pattern of the slit image .",
    "we identified a total of 125 stars in the area of present concern using the _ td-1 _ catalog and the _ tycho-2 _ spectral type catalog @xcite .",
    "the masked positions are indicated in figure 1 .",
    "for the emission line image , we took the 15311570  portion of the l - channel spectrum and fitted it with a constant continuum plus @xmath01548 , 1551 lines for each pixel . for better statistics , we increased the pixel size by 16 times ( ` nside ` = 128 , corresponding to a pixel size of @xmath327.5@xmath4 ) .",
    "we assumed a 2:1 line ratio for 1548 and 1551  doublet lines , as in an optically thin case @xcite .",
    "the model spectrum was convolved with a gaussian function with the width of the fims / spear spectral resolution . because the signal from each pixel was not strong , the image",
    "was then smoothed using the spherical version of a gaussian kernel with full width at a half - maximum of 60.0@xmath4 @xcite so that -detected regions with @xmath173 @xmath18 confidence could be obtained .",
    "however , the -detected regions should be double - checked because this smoothing method assumes gaussian statistics and the result for the region with poor count statistics may not be reliable .",
    "figure 1 shows the final result of the emission line image .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , there is a strong region at @xmath19 with its peak value of @xmath35.0 @xmath12 10@xmath20 photons s@xmath5 @xmath21 sr@xmath5 ( hereafter lu ) .",
    "although the boundary of this strong region is ambiguous due to smoothing , the emission patterns for this region in the original unsmoothed image are not dominated by only a few pixels and essentially the same as those in the smoothed image .",
    "the weaker region at @xmath22 is also identified with @xmath173 @xmath18 confidence in this smoothed image .",
    "however , we believe the detection from this weaker region is marginal as its intensity is low and the confidence level of the emission line in the spectrum is @xmath232 @xmath18 , as will be mentioned below . in figure 2 , h@xmath1 contours in the range of 70190 r are overplotted on the emission line image .",
    "the h@xmath1 contours show two filamentary features , the sharp one in the southeast ( h@xmath1 filament a ) and the broad one in the west ( h@xmath1 filament b ) .",
    "the position of is near h@xmath1 filament b , as marked by an asterisk in the figure .",
    "interestingly , while the strong region appears near the inside of h@xmath1 filament a and is extended over to the filament , there is no enhanced feature near h@xmath1 filament b. we have marked three interesting regions with designations r1 through r3 : the strongest region including h@xmath1 filament a ( r1 ) , the weaker region ( r2 ) , and h@xmath1 filament b ( r3 ) .",
    "the archival data of h@xmath1 was adopted from the skyview virtual observatory @xcite .    in figure 3 , we have plotted the spectra for the whole region and subregions r1 through r3 .",
    "the detector background was subtracted in these spectra despite their small size : @xmath30.1% of the lowest continuum level of the whole region or @xmath37.3% of the continuum level of region r2 .",
    "the spectra were binned at 3  intervals and shown with 1 @xmath18 error bar in the figure .",
    "the spectrum for the whole region shows the @xmath01548 , 1551 doublet , which is , however , unresolved due to 3  binning , in addition to rather weak ionic lines such as @xmath6 1640 , and ] @xmath6 1666 .",
    "however , the or ] line does not appear clear , and no spatial feature of either line appearing to be correlated with was found .",
    "we fitted the spectrum for each subregion to obtain the emission line intensity and the results are @xmath24 lu for r1 , @xmath25 lu for r2 , and @xmath26 lu for r3 . for region",
    "r1 , the emission line intensity was determined with @xmath174 @xmath18 confidence while the confidence level is @xmath232 @xmath18 for region r2 .",
    "we estimated the luminosity of region r1 for various assumed distances to the target , with or without reddening - corrections . for reddening - correction",
    ", we adopted three different methods to calculate the foreground extinction .",
    "firstly , we assumed a global galactic distribution model of dust and then estimated the foreground extinction from the column density of dust to region r1 .",
    "adopting the two - components model of @xcite and assuming the vicinity of the sun ( 8 kpc from the galactic center ) that lies exactly on the galactic plane , the column density of dust to a target which has the galactic latitude @xmath27 and the distance @xmath28 is @xmath29 \\ ; dr \\quad ( \\textrm{gr cm}^{-2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 gr @xmath31 , @xmath32 kpc , @xmath33 kpc , @xmath34 gr @xmath31 , @xmath35 kpc , and @xmath36 kpc from table 2 in @xcite .",
    "multiplying the extinction cross section of 6.7 @xmath12 10@xmath20 @xmath37 gr@xmath5 for the galactic dust with @xmath38 = 3.1 @xcite and substituting @xmath39 for region r1 , the foreground extinction can be represented as a function of the distance .",
    "secondly , we simply adopted the observed value of @xmath40 for ( 0.38 ; dessart et al .",
    "2000 ) and applied it regardless of the distances .",
    "finally , we used the data in the catalog of extinctions and distances by @xcite to estimate the foreground extinction with various distances .",
    "a total of 18 stars are listed in the catalog for region r1 together with the distance information , except for five stars for which we used the distance data from the hipparcos satellite ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "the effective average value of @xmath40 for various stars can be calculated from the effective optical depth , @xmath41 .",
    "we calculated the effective average values of @xmath40 for 15 stars within 0.75 kpc , 16 stars within 1.0 kpc , and all 18 stars within 1.25 kpc , and obtained the same value of 0.12 for all three cases . using these estimations of the foreground extinction and the extinction curve of @xcite with @xmath38 = 3.1 ,",
    "three curves for the estimated luminosities were plotted in figure 4 , along with the case without reddening correction .",
    "the implications of these curves , representing the estimated luminosity as a function of distance , will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "to compare the present emission line results with 21 cm morphologies , we employed the parkes survey data , which is part of the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2005 ) , a survey of the spectral line and 21 cm emission in the fourth quadrant of the galactic plane .",
    "the parkes data have an angular resolution of @xmath315@xmath4 and a spectral resolution of 0.82 km s@xmath5 , which are @xmath334 times better than those of the data used in @xcite .",
    "fits format data , consisting of orthographic projected images on the galactic coordinates for each local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity , are provided online ( http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/hi/common/ ) .",
    "figure 5 shows 21 cm morphologies toward the region for lsr velocity range @xmath42 km s@xmath5 .",
    "while we used a different projection type for the maps in figure 5 from that of figure 2 , the projected areas are more or less the same .",
    "even a cursory examination of figure 5 reveals that the morphology varies greatly as the lsr velocity changes . to emphasize the features associated with or , we selected three velocity ranges of figure 5 and compared the resulting images with the image of figure 2 in figure 6 . in figure 6@xmath43",
    ", we have drawn a circle with a radius of 1@xmath15 centered on marked by an asterisk , and this coincides well with an void at @xmath44 km",
    "the void looks especially clear on the northern limb of the circle for velocities ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 km s@xmath5 in figure 5 .",
    "another void indicated by a circle with a radius of 2.25@xmath15 in figures 6@xmath276@xmath28 shows the best agreement with the h@xmath1 filamentary features at @xmath47 km s@xmath5 , as can be seen in figures 6@xmath27 and 6@xmath28 , although the associated features are noticeable at wider velocity ranges ( from about @xmath48 to about + 1.05 km s@xmath5 ) in figure 5 .",
    "as the velocity increases from @xmath47 km s@xmath5 in figure 5 , the void progressively shrinks in the southeastern part , and it becomes more or less coincident with the enhanced region ( r1 ) , as can be seen in figures 6@xmath49 and 6@xmath28 .    to confirm the existence of the two independent bubbles , we made lsr velocity profiles for the centers of the two assumed bubbles : one for the position of marked in figure 6@xmath43 and the other for the center of the circle indicated in figure 6@xmath27 .",
    "as the results are compared in figure 7 , both profiles have hollows overlapped at the same lsr velocity of @xmath50 km s@xmath5 , corresponding to the large bubble indicated in figure 6@xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity profile for indeed shows an additional hollow at @xmath44 km s@xmath5 , which confirms the existence of the smaller bubble indicated in figure 6@xmath43 .",
    "we have found an enhanced region ( r1 ) which seems to be correlated with h@xmath1 filament a although it looks more extensive due to smoothing , as can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "moreover , the void of @xmath47 km s@xmath5 correlated clearly with the h@xmath1 filaments in figures 6@xmath27 and 6@xmath28 , shrinks at higher lsr velocities to become coincident with this enhanced region , as can be seen in figures 6@xmath49 and 6@xmath28 .",
    "these correlations between the features seen in three different wavelength domains strongly suggest that they are physically associated with each other .",
    "the line luminosity estimated in the section above may constrain the possible origin of the nebulosity , particularly in connection with . the line luminosity from an old snr or from an region should be much lower than that of the , which is a well - known middle - aged snr with a strong x - ray emission . as can be seen in figure 4 ,",
    "the estimated luminosity with reddening - correction by assuming the global galactic distribution of dust , exceeds that of the ( 44.7 @xmath12 10@xmath51 ergs s@xmath5 ; seon et al .",
    "2006 ) for a distance of more than @xmath30.5 kpc .",
    "this means that the distance to is much closer to us than whose distance is @xmath31.55 kpc @xcite unless the foreground extinction along the line of sight toward region r1 is much lower than expected from the global galactic distribution of dust .",
    "when @xmath40 = 0.38 for is adopted , the estimated luminosity still exceeds that of the for a distance of more than @xmath30.5 kpc and becomes @xmath310 times larger than that of the at 1.55 kpc .",
    "the foreground extinction toward region r1 could possibly be lower than toward . if we , therefore , adopt @xmath40 = 0.12 obtained from the 18 stars within region r1 , the estimated luminosity with the assumed distance of 1.55 kpc becomes similar to that of the at its lower limit of the 1 @xmath18 error , which is related to the error in the estimation of line intensity for region r1 .",
    "however , as those stars within the specified distances ( 0.75 , 1.0 , and 1.25 kpc ) were employed for the estimation of @xmath40 , the above value of @xmath40 = 0.12 is actually a lower limit of the foreground extinction along the line of sight toward the target located behind the corresponding distances .",
    "therefore , the luminosity reddening - corrected by @xmath40 = 0.12 is also a lower limit of the luminosity for the distance of 1.55 kpc .",
    "hence , if the emission line of region r1 comes from the same distance ( @xmath31.55 kpc ) as , its total luminosity more likely exceeds that of the . in conclusion , the association of with or its progenitor seems implausible and is likely to be much closer to us than the star .",
    "furthermore , no direct association between and is evidenced by the results of the 21 cm observations . as mentioned in section 4 , we found another small void toward .",
    "we believe the newly identified void centering on in figure 6@xmath43 and the previously identified void @xcite in figure 6@xmath27 are the two independent bubbles associated with and , respectively .",
    "the radius of the smaller void ( @xmath31@xmath15 ) is equivalent to the radius of @xmath327 pc at a distance of 1.55 kpc , which is compatible with those of the bubbles found around other wc - type wr stars @xcite .",
    "we also note that the systemic lsr velocity of the smaller bubble associated with is faster than that of the larger bubble associated with .",
    "the smaller void appears largest at @xmath52 km s@xmath5 in figure 5 and the velocity profile passing through the center of this void shows a hollow exactly at the same velocity in figure 7 , meaning that @xmath53 km s@xmath5 is the systemic velocity of the expanding bubble . on the other hand ,",
    "the systemic velocity of the larger bubble is around @xmath50 km s@xmath5 , where the hollows of the two velocity profiles coincided in figure 7 , although the void shows the best agreement with the h@xmath1 filaments at @xmath54 km s@xmath5 . in view of the galactic rotation ,",
    "the approaching speed increases with distance within a few kpc in the direction of @xmath55 on the galactic plane .",
    "hence , this is again consistent with our argument based on the emission study that is closer than .",
    "when the [ ] @xmath06717 , 6731/h@xmath1 line ratio is greater than 0.5 , it is believed that the emission is produced by shock - excited gas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio is usually much smaller in regions and planetary nebulae .",
    "the three positions mentioned in @xcite , which have the [ ] /h@xmath1 line ratios typical of regions , precisely fit the northern envelope of the smaller void , as denoted by three diamonds in figure 6@xmath43 .",
    "this implies that the apparent northern envelope of the bubble is photoionized by .",
    "the broadness of h@xmath1 filament b could be due to the overlap by the region around behind .",
    "two stars with a complex of d1 & d2 absorption lines in @xcite are also located within the smaller void of figure 6@xmath43 . therefore , these complexities may not arise from their distances , as suggested , but may rather result from the positions of these stars which happen to be along the line of sight towards the bubble created by .",
    "one of these stars is just .",
    "one more interesting feature is that strong emission appears near h@xmath1 filament a while no enhanced feature is seen near h@xmath1 filament b in figure 2 .",
    "hence , if the extinctions towards these two regions are not too different , the difference in the emission should be the result of the non - uniform evolution of .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the [ ] /h@xmath1 line ratio , which is more or less independent of extinction , appears to be larger along h@xmath1 filament a than along h@xmath1 filament b and that it is in the range 0.50.7 for about half of the observed positions .",
    "this result led them to suggest that the expanding shock is interacting more strongly with the ism in the region of h@xmath1 filament a away from the galactic plane . though the boundary of the enhanced region ( r1 ) is rather ambiguous",
    "because of smoothing , this region seems to be more prominent inside the filament than outside .",
    "this broad region could be a zone of cooling and recombining c@xmath9 ions which is expected to be developed widely in a fairly cooled snr @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe is an old snr which has evolved in a non - uniform ambient ism with a lower - density southeast region . this snr seems to have been cooled enough now so that soft x - ray emission is undetectable and emission is seen only in the south and east regions , where the gas of @xmath710@xmath8 k may still remain because the ambient ism of lower density may have allowed the snr to evolve slowly there .",
    "the morphology of the void associated with can support the above scenario .",
    "a long and thin feature seen at lsr velocities ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 km s@xmath5 appears outside h@xmath1 filament a and the enhanced region , as can be seen in figures 6@xmath276@xmath28 .",
    "if this filament were a cool shell of the snr , it should be inside h@xmath1 filament a because cool shells form behind evolved shocks of snrs @xcite .",
    "therefore , this suggests that the filament is not the cool shell of and the whole cavity containing has likely pre - existed the sn explosion which led to the snr . as many cases of other snrs , may have evolved in this pre - existing cavity .",
    "we also note that the void feature remains in the southeast part as lsr velocity increases from the systemic ( central ) lsr velocity of @xmath50 km s@xmath5 to higher values , as mentioned in section 4 . considering the radial structure of expanding bubble centered at @xmath58 km s@xmath5 , the h i features at these higher velocities ( @xmath59 km s@xmath5 ) correspond to the rear side of the cavity .",
    "this implies that the cavity protrudes outward to the rear side of the cavity at the southeast region .",
    "the detection of the emission line in the southeast region seems to indicate that have evolved relatively slow in this protruded region compared to other regions and the -emitting gas still remains in the region .",
    "we have presented the results of the @xmath01548 , 1551 emission line detection for the region of using the data set of fims / spear .",
    "we revealed an enhanced region , which is closely associated with one of the h@xmath1 filamentary features of .",
    "we argued that is not associated with and is likely to be much closer to us than the star , based on the luminosity estimation .",
    "we also found from the sgps 21 cm analysis that there is another smaller bubble centered on that is not related to the larger bubble associated with .",
    "the enhanced region is located near the sharp h@xmath1 filament in the southeast while no enhanced feature is seen near the broad h@xmath1 filament in the west .",
    "also , the cavity pre - existing appears to protrude outward to the rear side of the cavity at the southeast region , where it is well overlapped with the enhanced region .",
    "these morphologies can be well explained by the scenario in which is an old snr which has evolved in a non - uniform ambient ism with a lower - density southeast region and happens to be located along the same line of sight toward the bubble around .",
