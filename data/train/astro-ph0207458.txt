    "<S> we present a proposal for a gravitational wave detector , based on the excitation of an electromagnetic mode in a resonance cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the mode is excited due to the interaction between a large amplitude electromagnetic mode and a quasi - monochromatic gravitational wave . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum metric perturbation needed for detection is estimated to the order @xmath0 using current data on superconducting niobium cavities . using this value together with different standard models predicting the occurrence of merging neutron star or black hole binaries , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding detection rate is estimated to 120 events per year , with a ` table top ' cavity of a few meters length .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    during the last decades the quest for detecting gravitational waves has intensified . </S>",
    "<S> the efforts have been inspired by the indirect evidence for gravitational radiation @xcite , advances in technology and the prospects of obtaining new useful astrophysical information through the development of gravitational wave astronomy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a number of ambitious detector projects are already in operation or being built all over the world , for example ligo and allegro in usa , virgo , auriga and geo 600 in europe , tama 300 in japan , aigo and niobe in australia @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there are well developed plans to use space based gravitational wave detectors , i.e. , the lisa project @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detection mechanisms are basically of a mechanical nature in the cases above , but there have also been several proposals for electromagnetic detection mechanisms @xcite .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we will investigate a detection mechanism based on the interaction of electromagnetic modes and gravitational radiation in a cavity with highly conducting walls </S>",
    "<S> . the main feature of our proposed gravitational wave detector is that it supports two electromagnetic eigenmodes with nearby eigenfrequencies , a possibility that has previously been discussed in refs </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if one eigenmode is excited initially ( called the pump - mode ) , and a quasi - monochromatic gravitational wave with a frequency equal to the eigenmode frequency difference reaches our system , a new electromagnetic eigenmode can be excited due to the gravitational - electromagnetic wave interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling mechanism is similar in principle to the wave interaction processes described in , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the low - frequency nature of the gravitational modes , as compared to the electromagnetic resonance frequencies , at first seem to greatly limit the efficiency of a cavity with nearby frequencies . to get a large gravitationally induced mode - coupling for a simple cavity geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the estimated cavity dimensions become prohibitively large , i.e. , comparable to the wavelength of the gravitational wave . solutions to this problem </S>",
    "<S> has been found by refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who has considered a gravitational wave detector consisting of two coupled cavities . </S>",
    "<S> cavities based on these principles have been built , and experimental results are presented in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider a single cavity with a variable crossection . </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of varying the crossection is the following . for a cavity with dimensions much smaller than the wavelength of the gravitational wave </S>",
    "<S> , the suggested geometry greatly magnifies the gravitational wave induced mode - coupling . in our present work </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated the effect of a varying crossection , by considering a cavity filled with three different dielectrics , in order to be able to perform most of the calculations analytically . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to make a semi - quantitative translation of our results to the case of a vacuum cavity with a varying crossection . using current data on the latter type of cavity @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the minimum detection level of the metric perturbation to the value @xmath1 , where we have considered an inspiraling neutron star or black hole pair as a gravitational wave source . </S>",
    "<S> if such a level of sensitivity can be reached , neutron star or black hole binaries close to collapse could be detected at a distance @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> adopting data from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the occurrence of compact binary mergers , we obtain the estimate 120 detection events per year .    in vacuum </S>",
    "<S> , a linearized gravitational wave can be represented by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 in standard notation .    </S>",
    "<S> neglecting terms proportional to derivatives of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the wave equation for the magnetic field is @xcite @xmath8{\\boldsymbol{b } } =     \\left [ h_+\\left ( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2 } -        \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2 } \\right )      + h_{\\times}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\partial z }      \\right]{\\boldsymbol{b } } ,   \\label{waveb}\\ ] ] and similarly for the electric field . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the index of refraction . for the moment </S>",
    "<S> , we will neglect mechanical effects , i.e. , effects which are associated with the varying coordinates of the walls due to the restoring forces of the cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of two electromagnetic modes and a gravitational wave in a cavity will depend strongly on the geometry of the electromagnetic eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we can greatly magnify the coupling , as compared to a rectangular prism geometry , by varying the cross - section of the cavity , or by filling the cavity partially with a dielectric medium . </S>",
    "<S> the former case is of more interest from a practical point of view , since a vacuum cavity implies better detector performance , but we will consider the latter case since it can be handled analytically . </S>",
    "<S> _ however _ , we will show how to make a semi - quantitative translation of our results to the case of a varying cavity cross - section .    specifically , we choose a rectangular cross - section ( side lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and we divide the length of the cavity into three regions . </S>",
    "<S> region 1 has length @xmath12 ( occupying the region @xmath13 ) and a refractive index @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> region 2 has length @xmath15 ( occupying the region @xmath16 ) , with a refractive index @xmath17 , while region 3 consists of vacuum and has length @xmath18 ( occupying the region @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is supposed to have positive coordinates , with one of the corners coinciding with the origin . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we require that @xmath20 , and that the wave number in region 2 is less than in region 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this arrangement is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we want to obtain a large coupling between the wave modes , and secondly we want an efficient filtering of the eigenmode with the lower frequency in region three .    the first step is to analyze the linear eigenmodes in this system . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest modes are of the type [ region1 ] @xmath21e^{-i\\omega t } ,   \\\\      b_{z } = \\widetilde{b}_{zj}\\cos \\left ( \\frac{m\\pi x}{x_0}\\right ) \\sin    [ k_{j}z + \\varphi_{j}]e^{-i\\omega t } , \\\\      b_{x } = -\\frac{k_{j}x_0}{m\\pi } \\widetilde{b}_{zj}\\sin    \\left ( \\frac{m\\pi x}{x_0}%    \\right ) \\cos [ k_{j}z + \\varphi_{j}]e^{-i\\omega t }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in regions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , where the wave in region 3 is a standing wave , and @xmath25 is the mode number . in region 3 we may also have a decaying wave [ region2b ] @xmath26e^{-i\\omega t } ,   \\\\      b_{z } = \\widetilde{b}_{z3}\\cos \\left ( \\frac{m\\pi x}{x_0}\\right ) \\sinh    [ k_{3}z+\\varphi _ { 3}]e^{-i\\omega t } , \\\\      b_{x } = -\\frac{k_{3}x_0}{m\\pi } \\widetilde{b}_{z3}\\sin \\left ( \\frac{m\\pi    x}{x_0}%    \\right ) \\cosh [ k_{3}z+\\varphi _ { 3}]e^{-i\\omega t } .   </S>",
    "<S> \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using standard boundary conditions , the wave numbers are calculated for an eigenmode , and the relation between the amplitudes in the three regions is found , and thereby the mode profile . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the shift from decaying to oscillatory behavior in region 3 . </S>",
    "<S> denote the highest frequency mode which is decaying in region 3 with index @xmath27 , and the wave number and decay coefficient with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the next frequency , which is oscillatory in both regions , is denoted by index @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> . if we have @xmath32 ( and @xmath25 the same ) these two frequencies will be very close , and a gravitational wave which has a frequency equal to the difference between the electromagnetic modes causes a small coupling between these modes . </S>",
    "<S> an example of two such eigenmodes is shown in fig .  1 .    , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is the solid line and @xmath38 is the dotted line , and @xmath39 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we define the eigenmodes to have the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a time - dependent amplitude and the normalized eigenmodes @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we let all electromagnetic field components be of the form @xmath44 , where c.c </S>",
    "<S> .  stands for complex conjugate , and the indices stand for the eigenmodes discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational perturbation can be approximated by @xmath45 , where we neglect the spatial dependency , since the gravitational wavelength is assumed to be much longer than all of the cavity dimensions . during a certain interval in time , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency matching condition @xmath46 will be approximately fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> given the wave equation ( [ waveb ] ) , and the above ansatz we find after integrating over the length of the cavity @xmath47 where @xmath48 and we have added a phenomenological linear damping term represented by @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we note that for the given geometry , only the @xmath50-polarization gives a mode - coupling . </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the eigenmode parameters show that @xmath51 may be different from zero when @xmath52 , and generally @xmath51 of the order of unity can be obtained , see fig .  1 for an example . </S>",
    "<S> from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ excitation - eq ] ) , we find that the saturated value of the gravitationally excited mode is @xmath53    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 it is shown that we can get an appreciable mode - coupling constant @xmath51 for a cavity filled with materials with different dielectric constants , and it is of interest whether or not this can be achieved in a vacuum cavity . as seen by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ coupling - int ] ) , the coupling is essentially determined by the wave numbers of the modes , given by @xmath54 . thus by adjusting the width @xmath10 in a vacuum cavity , we may get the same variations in the wave numbers as when varying the index of refraction @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the translation of our results to a vacuum cavity with a varying width is not completely accurate , however . when varying @xmath10 , the mode - dependence on @xmath55 and @xmath56 does not exactly factorize , in particular close to the change in width . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the contribution to the coupling @xmath57 in each section becomes proportional to the corresponding volume , and thereby also to the cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> however , since most of the contribution to the integral in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ coupling - int ] ) comes from region 1 , our results can still be approximately translated to the case of a vacuum cavity , by varying @xmath10 instead of @xmath9 such as to get the same wavenumber as in our above example .    </S>",
    "<S> we denote the minimum detection level of the excited mode with @xmath58 and the maximum allowed field in the cavity with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field @xmath58 is related to the minimum number of photons @xmath60 needed for detection by @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have @xmath62 @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the quality factor of the cavity , and thus we obtain , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ saturation - eq ] ) , @xmath65 before giving estimates of the parameter values , we will investigate certain other effects that may limit the detection efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> massive binaries produce monochromatic radiation to a good approximation , but close to merging , the frequency will be increasing rather rapidly which means that the phase matching will be lost . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is designed to detect the frequency @xmath66 , and we have assumed that the signal varies as @xmath67 , but in reality we have @xmath68 , where for simplicity we assume @xmath69 , @xmath70 at @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time @xmath72 is roughly defined by @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] provided @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> using newtonian calculations of two masses @xmath76 in circular orbits around the center of mass , complemented by the quadrupole formula for gravitational radiation , we find @xmath77 close to binary merging , the time of coherent interaction will be shorter than the photon life time , and in that regime the growth of the excited mode is limited by decoherence rather than the damping due to a finite quality factor of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> however , formula ( [ hplus ] ) can still be applied if we simply replace @xmath78 by @xmath79 .    to be able to estimate the number of photons needed for detection </S>",
    "<S> , we must study various sources of noise . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest effect is direct thermal excitation of photons in mode @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> since each mode has a thermal energy level of order @xmath80 , the number of such photons is @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will also have a contribution associated with thermal variations in the length of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> a standard model for the variations in length @xmath82 is @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the eigenfrequency of longitudinal oscillations ( of the order of the acoustic velocity in the cavity divided by the length ) , @xmath85 is the mechanical quality factor associated with these oscillations , and @xmath86 is the stochastic acceleration due to the thermal motion , giving rise to a random walk in the oscillation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> first we note that the amplitude of the length variations with the gravitational frequency is @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the case when @xmath88 , which implies that _ the amplitude _ of the gravitational length perturbation is essentially unaffected by the restoring force of the cavity , as is the number of gravitationally generated photons .    the thermal fluctuation contribution to the right hand side of eq.([excitation - eq </S>",
    "<S> ] ) , via the coupling to the pump wave , becomes proportional to @xmath89 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath90 , the longitudinal oscillations give rise to slightly off - resonant ( i.e. , driven ) fields with a frequency difference @xmath91 compared to mode @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the stochastic changes in amplitude and/or phase of the longitudinal oscillation ( where the time - scale for significant changes is given by @xmath92 ) , a contribution to mode @xmath31 of the order @xmath93 is also made during a single oscillation period @xmath94 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is the mass taking part in the longitudinal oscillation . during a time of the order @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> , this contribution adds up to approximately @xmath96 by a random walk process . using @xmath97 , the condition for the gravitational contribution @xmath98 to be larger than that of the thermal fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> can be written @xmath99    assume that we want to reach a sensitivity @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 which gives @xmath105 . furthermore , we take @xmath106 and let @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath108 together with @xmath109 . from ( [ h_therm_cond ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we then find that we need a mechanical quality factor @xmath110 to reach the desired sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , assuming the necessary number of photons for detection to be @xmath111 ( well above the direct electromagnetic noise level of a few photons ) , @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xcite , we need an electromagnetic quality factor @xmath114 to reach the desired sensitivity @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the coherence time is slightly longer than the photon life - time , as needed .    </S>",
    "<S> following the example given above for calculating the coherence time , i.e. , a binary consisting of two compact objects , each of one solar mass @xmath116 , separated by a distance @xmath117 , the amplitude of the metric perturbation at a distance @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath120 corresponding to @xmath106 , and thus for @xmath121 of the order of @xmath122 we obtain the maximum observational distance @xmath123 . using data from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we deduce that the number of galaxies within the observational distance @xmath2 is of the order @xmath124 . combining these figures with the expected number of compact binary mergers per galaxy and million years @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a detection rate in the interval @xmath125 events per year ( the uncertainty is due to different models used for the birth of compact binaries ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our proposal for a gravitational wave detector is to a large extent based on currently available technology @xcite , and our requirements are moderate given the performance of some existing microwave cavities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , values of @xmath126 has been reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and quantum non - demolition measurements of single microwave photons have been made in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the key performance parameters of the superconducting niobium cavities , i.e. , the quality factor and the maximum allowed field strength before field emission , have been improving over the years , suggesting that the detection sensitivity can be increased even further .    </S>",
    "<S> a sensitivity @xmath127 seems extremely good , but , on the other hand , idealizations have been made when making the estimate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to any effects induced by the gravitational wave , the walls generally vibrate slightly due to the electromagnetic forces exerted by the large pump field . while these later oscillations clearly will be larger than the variations in length that are directly due to the gravitational wave </S>",
    "<S> , the associated nonlinearities will be harmonics of the pump frequency , and thus such effects do not couple to the other eigenmodes of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have assumed that the detection of the excited mode is not much affected by the presence of the pump signals . </S>",
    "<S> even though mode @xmath27 is partially filtered out in region 3 , the small frequency shift between the two electromagnetic modes may pose a certain difficulty in this respect : in particular , a very narrow bandwidth ( pump ) antenna signal must be used , in order to exclude the slightest initial perturbation at the gravitationally excited frequency @xmath128 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , although there are technical difficulties in constructing an electromagnetic detector , the real advantage is the possibility to reduce the size of the devise . in the example </S>",
    "<S> presented above , the length of the cavity has been taken to be @xmath129 , and the cross section roughly @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> this alone could prove to be useful when trying to set up new gravitational wave observatories .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank ulf jordan for helpful discussions . </S>"
