    "volume of work has followed the prediction@xcite that the use of multiple antennas in transmitting and receiving signals can result to substantial increases in information throughput .",
    "the underlying assumptions of this effort have been that the receiver knows the channel through some training scheme and that the channel coefficients are statistically independent . in this case and for large signal to noise ratio @xmath3 , the capacity is roughly @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath1 are the numbers of transmitting and receiving antennas .    in a typical mobile wireless communication system",
    "the channel coefficients vary continuously , following a jakes - like distribution .",
    "thus one can only assume that the channel is approximately constant over only limited periods of time .",
    "hence , especially for large transmitting antenna numbers , training will require a substantial fraction of the coherence time of the channel and thus hamper the data throughput rates . to address this problem , marzetta and hochwald@xcite investigated the scenario where the receiver has no a - priori channel knowledge .",
    "in addition to the conventional additive gaussian noise , this channel has also multiplicative noise , corresponding to the channel matrix , which is also assumed to be gaussian .",
    "this is a `` non - coherent '' channel , as opposed to the additive white gaussian noise channel with known ( and static ) `` coherent '' channel coefficients at the receiver . in an elegant group - theoretic approach , zheng and tse @xcite found the capacity of this channel to scale as @xmath6 for large @xmath3 , where @xmath7 and @xmath0 is the number of time intervals over which the channel is static .",
    "a similar approach was developed independently by @xcite .",
    "this implies that for fixed @xmath0 , there is no need to use more than @xmath8 transmitters .    to take advantage of the constancy of the channel over @xmath0 time intervals",
    ", @xcite proposed to encode the signal using @xmath9 isotropic unitary matrices . in this encoding , called isotropic unitary space - time modulation ( ustm ) ,",
    "a symbol can be spread not only over @xmath5 antennas , but also over @xmath0 time intervals .",
    "some analytic results on the mutual information of ustm already exist .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that for @xmath10 @xcite and for @xmath11 and large @xmath3 @xcite the optimal input distribution is isotropic random unitary , i.e. that of ustm . thus the asymptotic capacity is equal to the mutual information , as in @xcite .",
    "recently , hassibi and marzetta @xcite analytically calculated the received signal distribution and thus were able to numerically evaluate the mutual information of ustm for a variety of @xmath5 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , confirming some of the above asymptotic results .",
    "more recently , @xcite generalized the received signal distribution to channels with spatial correlation .    in the case of ustm it is implicitly assumed that , after @xmath0 symbols the channel completely changes .",
    "in contrast , differential phase - shift keying ( dpsk ) @xcite has been used extensively to take advantage of the continuous slow - varying nature of the channel , without needing to perform any training . in this scheme , each transmitted symbol is encoded into a phase - difference from the previous symbol .    in @xcite ,",
    "the concept of differential modulation was extended to multi - antenna systems . in this method ,",
    "called differential unitary space - time modulation ( dustm ) , the signal is encoded over @xmath5 transmitting antennas and @xmath5 time intervals using an @xmath12 unitary matrix . in each successive @xmath5 time intervals ,",
    "the transmitter encodes the input signal by multiplying a @xmath12 unitary matrix to the unitary matrix transmitted during the previous @xmath5 time intervals over the @xmath5 antennas and then transmits the matrix product . in turn",
    ", the receiver decodes the signal by comparing the received signal from the @xmath5 antennas and @xmath5 time intervals to that received over the previous @xmath5 time intervals .",
    "thus this scheme requires no training and assumes that the channel is fixed over @xmath13 time intervals .",
    "the technique of dustm can be applied to the mathematically identical space - frequency channel that appears during a single ofdm symbol interval , resulting in a variation called differential unitary space - frequency modulation ( dusfm ) @xcite .    despite its importance in practical applications @xcite ,",
    "no analytic results are available regarding the mutual information of dustm and its comparison with ustm for @xmath13 .",
    "the main obstacle has been the difficulty in integrating over exponentials of unitary matrices .",
    "this is a problem that was tackled in the 80 s by high - energy physicists in analyzing the nuclear strong interactions ( quantum chromodynamics ) . due to the @xmath14 symmetry of these interactions their fluctuations can in certain cases",
    "be represented by unitary matrices .",
    "thus to integrate them out , one needs to make use of such integrals of exponentials of unitary matrices . in this paper",
    "we apply these results derived by @xcite to the context of dustm .",
    "the methodology of the proof in @xcite is based on mapping the original problem to a diffusion problem of eigenvalues , which has a differential equation that can be solved .",
    "given its complexity it will not be discussed at all in this paper . however , the interested reader is referred to @xcite , where some of us apply the method of character expansion to derive the same result and apply it to the capacity of ricean mimo channels . in the present paper",
    ", we get the following results :    1 .",
    "we analytically calculate the received signal distribution for the case of dustm ( see section [ sec : closed - form solution px_dustm ] ) .",
    "2 .   using this received signal distribution , we evaluate numerically @xmath15 , the mutual information of dustm for a variety of @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and compare it to @xmath16 , the mutual information of ustm setting @xmath13 . at low @xmath3 we find that the two mutual informations for the same @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 are nearly identical .",
    "this implies that the number of bits _ per symbol _",
    "i.e. @xmath17 is twice @xmath18 . in contrast , at large @xmath3 the number of bits / symbol of the two schemes approach each other , but with @xmath19 .",
    "we compare the maximum with respect to @xmath5 of the two mutual informations per symbol .",
    "for fixed @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 , we find that while at large @xmath3 we have @xmath20 , at small @xmath3 the opposite inequality holds .",
    "4 .   we back the above numerical results by providing expansions of the mutual information for both small and large @xmath3 .",
