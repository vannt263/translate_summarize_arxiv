    "the well known epr paradox @xcite , which is presented by einstein , podolsky and rosen , have triggered a long - time debate on quantum mechanics versus classical local realism . fundamentally different from classical correlations",
    ", the quantum theory allows correlation between spatially separated systems .",
    "however , the clauser - horner - shimony - holt ( chsh)inequality @xcite , which places an upper bound on the correlations compatible with classical local realistic theories , provides a way of experimentally testing the local hidden variable model ( lhvm ) as an independent hypothesis separated from the quantum formalism .",
    "it was proved that all pure entangled states of two qubits violate the chsh inequality , and the amount of violation increases as their entanglement increase @xcite . for three - qubit states",
    "the svetlichny inequality @xcite can be used to check tripartite nonlocal correlations in the similar way .",
    "it has recently been shown that a class of generalized ghz ( gghz ) states do not obey the svetlichny inequality until their three - tangle is less than @xmath0 , while another set of states known as the maximal slice states do violate the svetlichny inequality , and the amount of violation increases as the degree of entanglement increases @xcite .",
    "it is well known that quantum mechanics and relativity theory play very important roles in modern physics . in order to be closer to the practice , a number of authors considered the effects of relative motion on entanglement and quantum information protocols not only for inertial observers @xcite , but also for accelerated systems @xcite .",
    "especially , the extension of quantum information theory to non - inertial setting related to the unruh effect @xcite has recently been a fascinating field and attracted much attentions@xcite . due to the thermal radiation of rindler particles , it was found that the degree of entanglement , from the viewpoint of non - inertial observers , degrades for both bosonic @xcite and fermionic fields @xcite .",
    "however , the remarkable different between these two entanglement in the non - inertial frames is that fermionic entanglement persists for any accelerations , while bosonic entanglement vanishes in the infinite accelerations limit . and it is thought that the difference directly derives from two different statistics ( boson - einstein statistic and fermi - dirac statistic)@xcite .",
    "besides , in order to further understand the fundament of quantum mechanics , nonlocality of quantum states has been given attentions @xcite as well .",
    "et  al_. pointed out that the residual entanglement of accelerated fermions is not nonlocal @xcite , and a. smith _",
    "et  al_. studied the tripartite nonlocality and showed that the svetlichny can be violated for any finite values of the acceleration @xcite .    although the entanglement and nonlocality of free fields without the influence of external forces have been investigated much from the view of uniformly accelerated observers @xcite , it is worthy to note that the process used before has some conceptual difficulties @xcite . especially , the unruh modes used in previous articles are spatial delocalized , so can not be measured .",
    "furthermore , from the perspective of inertial observer they are highly oscillatory near the acceleration horizon , which implies that they are physically unfeasible states . to avoid these problems , in this paper the nonlocality and entanglement of two - qubit and three - qubit states",
    "are studied in a quite different way .",
    "we model the considered qubits by two - level semiclassical detectors coupled to the massless scalar field , and compare our results with that of free field model .",
    "we find that the sudden death of entanglement occurs for two - qubit state , and for three - qubit state the entanglement vanishes in the limit of infinite acceleration .",
    "moreover , their nonlocal correlations vanish for finite values of the acceleration .",
    "these results demonstrate that the loss of information , due to the influence of external force , is enhanced in our model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section 1 ] we simply introduce the model of accelerated qubit . in sec . [ section 2 ] the nonlocality and entanglement of the two - qubit and three - qubit states when one of them accelerates are studied .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief summary of our paper .",
    "[ system ]      we use two - level semiclassical unruh - dewitt detectors as our qubit model(more details have been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . it is _ classical _ in the sense that it possesses a well - defined classical world line while _ quantum _ because its internal degree of freedom are treated quantum mechanically .",
    "as introduced by unruh and wald @xcite , we also assume that the energy gap of this two - level detector is @xmath1 , and then its proper hamiltonian is give by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the lowering and raising operators of the qubit , i. e. , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 are the corresponding unexcited and excited energy eigenstates .    assuming that the qubit interacts with a real , massless scalar field @xmath10 , accordingly , the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath11   , \\label{hi}%\\ ] ] where the integration is over the global spacelike cauchy surface @xmath12 in minkowski spacetime , and the real - valued function @xmath13 denotes the coupling constant which is introduced to keep the detector switched on within a finite interval in @xmath14 of duration @xmath15 and switched off outside that interval . the smooth function @xmath16 , which vanishes outside a small volume around the qubit , models that the detector only interacts with the field in a neighborhood of its world line .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian can be represented as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the free scalar field hamiltonian .",
    "it is well known that evolution of the total system including detector and external field obeys schrdinger equation , so by using the interaction picture and taking the fist perturbation order the final state of the qubit - field system is give by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the final and initial state , respectively .",
    "the modes @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 with the testing function @xmath24 , here @xmath25 is an operator that takes the positive frequency part of the solutions of the klein - gordon equation with respect to the timelike isometry , and @xmath26 is given by @xmath27f(x'),\\label{ef}%\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the advanced and retarded green s functions , respectively .",
    "seen from equation  ( [ primeira_ordem_2 ] ) , it implies that the excitation and de - excitation of an unruh - dewitt detector that follows a timelike isometry is associate with the absorption and emission of a particle as naturally  defined by observers co - moving with the detector .",
    "the detector considered here is modeled flips once or none at all .",
    "our model can be constructed as following : two qubits , which have no interaction , are shared by alice and bob .",
    "alice s qubit is kept inertial , while bob s qubit has a constant proper acceleration @xmath30 along the @xmath31 axis for the finite amount of proper time @xmath15 , accordingly .",
    "bob s world line is given by @xmath32 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the qubit proper time and @xmath35 are the usual cartesian coordinates of minkowski space - time .",
    "if the detector is assumed be localized , we can choose the gaussian @xmath36 with variance @xmath37 to realize it . and",
    "it is important to note that @xmath38 means our detector is the point detector .",
    "let us consider a complete system consisting of the detectors and the external scalar field , which is denoted by @xmath39 where the subscripts @xmath40 and @xmath41 label alice s and bob s qubit , respectively , and @xmath42 corresponds to minkowski vacuum of the scalar field .",
    "our detectors are designed that alice s qubit is consistently switched off while bob s qubit is kept switched on only during the nonzero time interval @xmath15 along which it interacts with the field through the effective coupling parameter @xmath43 [ see below ] .",
    "therefore , to describe the interaction between bob s qubit and field , we should take the interaction hamiltonian shown in eq .",

    "analogously , we can also use a three - qubit state as the initial state , for an example , the ghz state .",
    "then the total state of the qubits and field is given by @xmath59    as we have assumed before , there is no interaction between qubits , and only the qubit possessed by charlie can interaction with the external field .",

    "means that the bell inequality is violated , and correspondingly the entanglement exists.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    it is necessary to note that the loss of information for free field model and detector model has different physical underpinnings . for free field model",
    ", a communication horizon appears from the perspective of the accelerated observer . as a results of that ,",
    "the observer has no access to field modes in the causally disconnected region , so must trace over the inaccessible region , which will results in a loss of information and a corresponding decrease of nonlocal correlation . for two - level semiclassical detector model , due to the interaction between the qubit and external field ,",
    "the information between the two - qubit system flows from qubits system to qubit - field system , and the nonlocal correlation correspondingly decreases .",
    "furthermore , a qubit accelerated will be influenced by some external force , thus the higher acceleration is , the more information loses .",
    "the reason is that , for higher acceleration , the unruh thermal bath contains more particles with proper energy @xmath1 which are able to interact with the detector .",
    "next we discuss how the unruh effect affects the entanglement quantified by concurrence . by using eqs .",

    "this is because the interaction , from the point of non - inertial observers , occurs between bob s qubit and the unruh thermal bath of rindler particles that they experience when the field is in the minkowski vacuum .",

    "<S> modeling the qubit by a two - level semiclassical detector coupled to a massless scalar field , we investigate how the unruh effect affects the nonlocality and entanglement of two - qubit and three - qubit states when one of the entangled qubits is accelerated . two distinct differences with the results of free field model in non - inertial frames </S>",
    "<S> are ( i ) for the two - qubit state , the chsh inequality can not be violated for sufficiently large but finite acceleration , furthermore , the concurrence will experience  sudden death \" ; and ( ii ) for the three - qubit state , not only the entanglement vanishes in the infinite acceleration limit , but also the svetlichny inequality can not be violated in the case of large acceleration . </S>"
