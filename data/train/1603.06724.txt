    "ultracold and interacting dilute alkali - metal vapors trapped by one - dimensional double - well potentials @xcite offer the opportunity to study the formation of macroscopic coherent states @xcite and macroscopic schrdinger - cat states @xcite .",
    "the two - site bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian @xcite efficiently describes the microscopic dynamics of such systems .",
    "when the boson - boson interaction is repulsive and the number of bosons is even , the crossover from a delocalized atomic coherent state to a ( fully incoherent ) localized fock state ( the so called twin fock state with the particles equally shared between the two wells ) takes place by increasing the interatomic coupling strength @xcite . for attractively interacting bosons , the two - spatial mode bh model predicts the formation of a macroscopic schrdinger - cat state @xcite when the interatomic attraction becomes sufficiently large . finally , when the attraction between the bosons is sufficiently strong the collapse should take place @xcite . in the schrdinger - cat states",
    "context , very recently , we have considered the possibility to induce such states in assisted way , thanks to the interaction of the bosonic matter with the radiation field inside an optical resonator , with onsite attractions weaker than those required without cavity radiation @xcite . on the repulsive side",
    ", the above described crossover is reminiscent of the quantum phase transition with optical - lattice - confined bosons theoretically predicted in @xcite and experimentally observed by greiner and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this quantum phase transition - induced by varying the depth of the optical potential - is a transition from the superfluid phase ( where the hopping dominates the hamiltonian : in this case each atom is spread out over the entire lattice ) to the mott insulator one ( where the onsite interaction dominates the hamiltonian : in this case , exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites ) .",
    "note that in the presence of strong onsite repulsions , an even - odd ( boson number ) difference exists . with such interactions , as commented above , when the number of bosons is even the lowest energy state is a separable twin fock state , while when the number of particles is odd the ground state is a symmetric linear superposition of two fock states with non - fully populated wells @xcite .",
    "this difference , which tends to become less relevant for larger particle numbers , is a well known mott insulators feature , as discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the above considerations hold for bosons with negligible dipole or electric moments so that the dipole - dipole interatomic interaction can be be safely neglected .",
    "this is not the case of dipolar bosonic atoms , as for example chromium @xmath5cr , characterized by very large atomic magnetic dipoles .",
    "the study of dipolar quantum gases began just with @xmath5cr @xcite , which has a magnetic momentum of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the bohr magneton ) , and recently important results have been achieved with lanthanide atoms like erbium @xmath8er @xcite and dysprosium @xmath9dy @xcite that have dipole moments of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "to date , as for what concerns dipolar bosons confined in few - site potentials important theoretical efforts have been devoted to investigate such systems in the presence of double @xcite , triple @xcite , and four - well potentials @xcite .",
    "remarkably , abad and co - workers @xcite have shown that the dipolar interaction makes possible self - inducing a double - well potential structure . moreover , in the context of dipolar bosons confined in triple - well shaped potentials , we have analyzed @xcite the problem also from the quantum correlations point of view as well by calculating the entanglement entropy @xcite , and in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have addressed the physics of the problem by stressing the role played by the anisotropic nature of the dipole - dipole interaction potential .    motivated by the concrete possibility to isolate single atomic ions @xcite and manipulate quantum gases at single - atom level @xcite , we focus on the behavior of few trapped bosonic dipolar atoms at zero temperature . in the present work , then , we aim to study the ground state of a system consisting of a low number @xmath0 of dipolar bosonic atoms confined in a symmetric double - well trap and to characterize such a state from the quantum correlations point of view .",
    "to do this we use the two - site extended bose - hubbard model ( ebh ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model includes , in addition to the standard nearest - neighbor hopping and onsite interaction , also the terms describing interaction , correlated , and bosonic - pair hopping with bosons in nearest - neighbor wells .",
    "in fact , these ( beyond - onsite ) terms widely studied for bosons loaded in optical lattices @xcite that originate from the contribution ( to the second quantized hamiltonian ) describing two - body interactions ( involving the product of four field operators , see sec .",
    "2 ) can not be neglected since the long - range nature of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "one thus refers to the correlated hopping as density - induced @xcite or collisionally - induced tunneling . note that in 2012 maluckov _",
    "_ @xcite have studied , in the mean - field limit , the ground state of dipolar bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices .",
    "we diagonalize the two - site extended bose - hubbard hamiltonian by analytically calculating the eigenvector and the eigenvalue of the lowest energy state state with @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons . hence , we provide analytical formulas for the parameters that describe the correlation properties of the ground state of the dipolar bosons .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have analytically calculated the ground state and correlation - characterizing parameters for a two - site bose - hubbard model with @xmath12 ( nondipolar ) bosons . in the present paper , we calculate the fisher information @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fluctuation of the number of bosons in a single well and achieves its maximum in correspondence to the schrdinger - cat state .",
    "we consider the coherence visibility @xmath14 @xcite which measures the coherence induced by the single - particle tunneling across the central barrier that attains its maximum value in correspondence to the atomic coherent state .",
    "finally , we drive our attention on the entanglement entropy @xmath15 @xcite which characterizes the genuine quantum correlations of the ground state from the bipartition perspective . to make simpler , but not trivial , our analysis and motivated by the recent review of dutta and co - workers @xcite and careful analysis by xiong and fischer @xcite in the context of the interaction - induced coherence in few - site - trapped bosons systems , we assume that the only active beyond - onsite process is the correlated hopping ( with the nearest - neighbor interaction reabsorbed in an effective onsite process )",
    ". thus we study the ground state and the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 by widely exploring the density - induced tunneling range - once fixed the onsite interaction - which , as discussed in @xcite , may change sign depending on the trap characteristics . in this way , we analyze the role of the correlated hopping in determining the form of the ground state sustained by the two - mode ebh .",
    "we point out that even if the onsite interaction is not strong enough for the formation of the schrdinger - cat state ( attractive onsite interactions ) or fock states ( repulsive onsite interactions ) , the presence of the collisionally - induced tunneling makes possible such circumstances .",
    "this is corroborated by a complete analysis of the fisher information , coherence visibility , and entanglement entropy performed by varying the onsite interaction and keeping fixed the correlated hopping .",
    "we investigate , moreover , the role of the density - induced tunneling in the occurrence of the atomic coherent state as ground state .",
    "to do this we fix the onsite interaction in such a way to have a cat - like - shaped ( strong attractions ) or fock states - structured ( strong repulsions ) ground state .",
    "then , by amply investigating the density - induced tunneling range , we observe that the correlated hopping tends to destroy the two ground states above in favor of a delocalized atomic coherent state . also in this case , a detailed analysis of the ground - state quantum correlations indicators gives us the possibility to complete and support our results .",
    "we consider @xmath0 identical interacting dipolar bosonic atoms at zero temperature .",
    "we suppose that these atoms are confined by an external potential @xmath16 achieved by superimposing an isotropic harmonic confinement  generated in the radial ( transverse ) plane ( @xmath17 )  to a symmetric a double - well @xmath18  created in the axial ( @xmath19 ) direction ",
    "namely @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mass of the bosons and @xmath22 the trapping frequency in the transverse directions .",
    "the system can be treated as quasi - one - dimensional since the above radial harmonic confinement is assumed to be very strong . under the condition",
    "that the energy per particle in the axial direction is much smaller than the transverse level spacing @xmath23 , one can assume that the bosons stay in the ground state of the transverse harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath24/(l_\\bot \\sqrt{\\pi})$ ] with @xmath25 being the transverse harmonic oscillator length .",

    ", from the middle panel it can be seen that the lowest value of the coherence visibility ( @xmath218 ) is achieved when @xmath191 , but when one explores larger values of @xmath200 both on the negative and positive side , @xmath14 sensibly increases and becomes almost equal to @xmath125 when @xmath219 that corresponds to the first plot ( left - right ) of the top row and to the third plot ( left - right ) of the bottom row of figs .",

    ", one expects that an increase of @xmath0 might make smaller ( than those of the cases with @xmath220 bosons ) both the range of hamiltonian parameters where the system exhibits a high degree of coherence ( i.e. , large values of @xmath14 ) and the absolute value of the ( effective ) on - site interaction signing the maximum of the entanglement entropy .",
    "we have investigated a finite number @xmath0 of interacting dipolar bosonic atoms confined in a one - dimensional double - well - induced geometry .",
    "within the two - site extended bose - hubbard ( ebh ) model framework ( which takes into account , in addition to the familiar bh terms , the density - density interaction , correlated hopping and bosonic - pair hopping involving atoms in adjacent wells ) we have carried out the zero - temperature analysis for @xmath1 and @xmath2 and found analytical formulas for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the corresponding ground states .",

    "we have pointed out that even if the onsite interaction is not strong enough to guarantee the occurrence of the schrdinger - cat state on the attractive side , or the formation of the twin fock ( @xmath1 ) and symmetric superposition of two separable fock states ( @xmath2 ) on the repulsive side , the presence of the collisionally - induced tunneling makes possible such circumstances .",
    "the second part of our analysis has concerned with the atomic coherent state .",
    "we have fixed the onsite interaction to a value such that to establish the cat - like ( strong attraction ) and fock states ( strong repulsion ) and widely explored the density - induced tunneling range .",
    "we have , in such a way , observed that the correlated hopping tends to destroy the afore mentioned ground states in favor of a delocalized atomic coherent state .",
    "a detailed analysis of fisher information , coherence visibility , and entanglement entropy has allowed us to have a complete picture of these two scenarios .    at this point , some considerations about future directions are in order . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have demonstrated the crucial importance of the competition between the contact and dipole - dipole interactions of opposite signs in determining the ground state of the system .",
    "then , this issue ( also with the numerical diagonalization with numbers of particles much larger than @xmath169 ) and the study of the possibility to apply the present analysis to the two - site hubbard system in the presence of two fermions with opposite orientations are the ideal candidates for our forthcoming studies .",
