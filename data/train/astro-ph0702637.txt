    "sgr a * is the compact radio source in our galactic center , originally discovered over 30 years ago by @xcite .",
    "years of dedicated observations of stellar orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and precise , high - resolution radio astrometry @xcite have led to sgr a * being unambiguously associated with the central supermassive black hole .",
    "most recently , the first measurements of the instrinsic size of sgr a * have been achieved @xcite , giving information about spatial structures extremely close to the black hole .    for many years",
    "sgr a * was only known to emit in the radio bands , with a flat / inverted spectrum fairly typical of the compact cores of other nearby low - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the absence of infrared and higher energy emission was puzzling given that at least some nonthermal accretion activity would be expected for a source that is powered by weak accretion .",
    "the first positive identification of sgr a * in the x - ray band with the _ chandra observatory _ did not immediately settle the issue @xcite .",
    "the dominant quiescent emission turned out to be extended and nonvariable , and thus likely associated with hot gas within the bondi capture radius of the black hole @xcite . in contrast , the approximately daily flares of nonthermal x - ray emission discovered later seem to originate within tens of @xmath2 from the black hole itself .",
    "since this discovery , sgr a * has also been identified in the near infrared ( nir ) , where it shows correlated variability with the x - ray band on similar timescales @xcite .",
    "while this suggests a low - level of active galactic nuclei ( agn)-like behavior , the luminosity of sgr a * ( @xmath3 ) is weak enough to raise questions about comparisons with more luminous accreting black holes .",
    "several models have been developed over the years to explain the broadband emission of sgr a * , ranging from bondi - hoyle infall @xcite , to various radiatively - inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ; @xcite ) , to jets @xcite , and combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "the persistence of such a wide range of models can be attributed to some extent to the lack of constraints on the nonthermal part of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "fitting the most compact `` submm bump '' region of the spectrum results in fairly similar internal parameters for all current models , and this `` theoretical degeneracy '' can not easily be broken without better morphological information from very large baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "unfortunately with current sensitivity and resolution limits , most structure in the source is washed out by a strong scattering medium in the central galactic regions ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , however , several new observational techniques have been developed which may help discern between various models .",
    "for instance , the stringent limits placed on the accretion rate ( @xmath4/yr ) by measurements of linear polarization @xcite have ruled out classical versions of the bondi - hoyle and advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models .",
    "similarly , better determinations of the frequency - dependence of the electron scattering law in the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite have resulted in new constraints on models via their size - versus - frequency predictions .",
    "while the different groups have found the index of the size - versus - frequency relation to range from @xmath5 , clearly any successful model must be stratified ( optically thick and thus having a photosphere whose observable size varies with frequency ) to achieve this .",
    "the determination of the scattering law to a high degree of accuracy has allowed , for the first time , a dependable measurement of the intrinsic size of sgr a * along one axis as a function of frequency .",
    "this breakthrough , along with the expectation of eventually determining the size in the other axis , means we are finally at a key point where differences between models can be empirically tested .    in this paper",
    ", we use both the spectral data in combination with the new vlbi measurements of the source photosphere at 43 ghz ( from @xcite plus one new observation , see below ) in order to place new constraints on jet models . in section  [ sec2 ] , we expand on the motivations for this project , in section  [ sec3 ] we introduce the model , in section  [ sec4 ] we explain the methodology and summarize our results in section  [ sec5 ] , and discuss our conclusions in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "because no jet in sgr a * has yet been directly imaged , it is important to first discuss the evidence in favor of jets in sgr a*. the lack of a resolved core / jet structure is not surprising given the low luminosity of sgr a * , which suggests a small angular size for the jet , and the scattering screen in our line of sight towards sgr a * , which obscures small structures .",
    "previous modeling of the structure of sgr a * has succeeded in separating the intrinsic and scatter - broadened images of sgr a * via a gaussian parameterization of the intrinsic size .",
    "a primary goal of this paper is to go beyond this simple parameterization .",
    "in fact , there are several strong arguments for jets in sgr a*. on a purely theoretical level , some form of jet production seems to go hand - in - hand with accretion around black holes , both at the galactic as well as stellar scales . in stellar black holes accreting from a binary companion , or x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) ,",
    "jet production is observed to be cyclic over outburst cycles .",
    "the strongest ( relative to the system energetics ) and steadiest jets occur during the low - luminosity state , called the low / hard state , while during the highest luminosity state , the jets appear quenched @xcite .",
    "the low - luminosity jets are compact and self - absorbed with a flat / inverted spectrum , and correlated radio / x - ray variability has demonstrated that the jets increasingly dominate the power output as the luminosity decreases @xcite .",
    "the weakest accreting black hole we can study with reasonable statistics besides sgr a * is the xrb a0620 - 00 , in which radio emission has recently been detected @xcite . at an x - ray luminosity of @xmath6 @xmath7 , very close to that of sgr a * , efficient jets are still produced in this black hole , with characteristics matching those at higher powers .",
    "if general relativity s basic prediction of scaling black hole physics holds , this is a strong argument for jet production in sgr a*.    the radio spectrum , radio variability , and high - frequency linear polarization are all similar to other nearby low - luminosity agn ( llagn ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the observed cores are accretion - powered , and have the signature flat / inverted , self - absorbed radio spectrum associated with compact jets @xcite .",
    "while the jets can only generally be resolved in the brightest sources , when they are resolved they dominate the unresolved core by at least a factor of a few .",
    "the results of these surveys strengthen the arguments for a jet in sgr a * based on its radio spectrum and polarization .",
    "one source that is particularly interesting because of its many parallels with sgr a * is the nucleus of the nearby llagn m81 .",
    "m81 * is our nearest llagn besides sgr a * , and resides in the same kind of spiral galaxy as the milky way .",
    "its mass has been derived from line spectroscopy ( using _ hst _ ; devereux et al . 2003 ) to be @xmath8 @xmath9 , only @xmath10 times the mass of sgr a*. m81 * also possesses the typical compact flat / inverted core spectrum ( @xcite ; markoff et al . , in prep . ) and , more importantly , the same high levels of circular rather than linear polarization in the centimeter radio band as sgr a * @xcite .",
    "the m81 * jet is one - sided , very small ( 700 - 3600 au depending on the frequency , with a roughly @xmath11 dependence ) , and exhibits occasional bends in its morphology @xcite . scaling the size by mass alone would argue for a @xmath12 au jet in sgr a * , but the observed size should also scale with luminosity , depending on the particulars of the jet model and frequency .",
    "in fact , the jet nature of m81 * was difficult to establish due to the high level of compactness .",
    "taking into account sgr a * s five orders of magnitude lower power , as well as the scattering screen , it is not surprising that no jet has yet been detected in our galactic center .",
    "another argument in favor of jets comes from the recent detection of short time delays of about 0.5 - 1 hr between 43 and 22 ghz for waves of variability traveling from high to low frequencies @xcite .",
    "this variability is fully consistent with outflowing , adiabatically expanding blobs of plasma , as would be expected for jets ( in fact , the model the authors use to interpret their results was developed in this context ) .    finally , the recent size - versus - frequency scaling detections support an optically thick , stratified model such as a self - absorbed jet .",
    "while the predictions of the jet model presented in @xcite , as well as that of riafs @xcite , are consistent with a @xmath13 scaling , and thus with the results in @xcite and @xcite , they disagree with the steeper index determined more recently by @xcite .",
    "if this latter result is indeed correct , it suggests that the current versions of all models , jets included , need to be modified to show a stronger dependence on observing frequency .",
    "because this issue is still under debate , however , in this paper we are still using the original scaling relation .",
    "although the circumstantial evidence is significant , there are other complications which could argue against jets .",
    "for instance , xrbs in their steady - jet producing low / hard state display a correlation between their radio and x - ray luminosities that holds over at least seven orders of magnitude in luminosity @xcite . among other things ,",
    "this correlation can be used as a gauge for `` typical '' levels of activity .",
    "the recent radio detection of a0620 - 00 falls exactly on the correlation , extending it to even lower luminosities and indicating that the same mechanism is at work as in brighter sources where jets can be imaged .",
    "if the physics driving the correlation scales in a predictable way with mass , it should apply to llagn as well , where the mass enters mainly as a normalization factor for the same correlation slope .",
    "this relationship between radio and x - ray luminosities and mass is called `` the fundamental plane of black hole accretion '' and has been explored in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "when sgr a * in quiescence is placed on this plane , it falls well below the correlation in predicted x - rays , given its radio luminosity .",
    "one could interpret this as the complete dominance of the jet over inflow processes at the lowest of luminosities , but it could also mean that the emission mechanisms themselves have undergone a transition to a different mode of emission entirely .    in order to try to cast new light on these long - standing ambiguities and",
    "place more stringent constraints on the possible presence of jets in sgr a * , we have developed a new method to combine spectral and morphological data .",
    "our results will set the stage for future tests with upcoming vlbi observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths , where the morphology is less affected by scattering and resolution is comparable to a few @xmath14 .",
    "like most models involving optically thick , collimated outflows , we build on the initial work of @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrated the `` conspiracy '' of how a perfectly flat spectrum ( @xmath15 ) can result from a superposition of self - absorbed contributions along a conical , idealized jet .",
    "when more realistic physics such as bulk acceleration , full particle distributions and cooling are included , compact jets show a slight spectral inversion in the radio wavebands , with @xmath16 . the model used here",
    "is based on a model developed for sgr a * @xcite , which has been significantly modified to extend to xrbs and llagn in general . for a detailed description see the appendix in @xcite ;",
    "we provide only a brief summary below .",
    "the model is based upon four assumptions : 1 ) the total power in the jets scales with the total accretion power at the innermost part of the accretion disk , @xmath17 , 2 ) the jets are freely expanding and only weakly accelerated via their own internal pressure gradients , 3 ) the jets contain cold protons which carry most of the kinetic energy while leptons dominate the radiation and 4 ) particles have the opportunity to be accelerated into power - law tails . in sources accreting at higher levels",
    "this latter point would be more important , but as we will show later , there is not much capacity in the sgr a * spectrum for significant particle acceleration .",
    "the base of the jets consist of a small nozzle of constant radius where no bulk acceleration occurs .",
    "the nozzle absorbs our uncertainties about the exact nature of the relationship between the accretion flow and the jets , and fixes the initial value of most parameters . beyond the nozzle the jet expands laterally with its initial proper sound speed for a relativistic electron / proton plasma , @xmath18 .",
    "the plasma is weakly accelerated by the resulting longitudinal pressure gradient force , allowing an exact solution for the velocity profile via the euler equation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a roughly logarithmic dependence of velocity upon distance from the nozzle , @xmath19 .",
    "the velocity eventually saturates at large distances at lorentz factors of @xmath202 - 3 .",
    "the size of the base of the jet , @xmath21 , is a free parameter ( but expected to fall within several @xmath14 ) and once fixed determines the radius as a function of distance along the jet , @xmath22 .",
    "there is no radial dependence in this model .",
    "the model is most sensitive to the fitted parameter @xmath23 , which acts as a normalization .",
    "it dictates the power initially divided between the particles and magnetic field at the base of the jet , and is expressed in terms of a fraction of the eddington luminosity @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 . once @xmath23 and @xmath21 are specified and conservation is assumed , the macroscopic physical parameters along the jet are determined .",
    "we assume that the jet power is roughly shared between the internal and external pressures .",
    "the radiating particles enter the base of the jet where the bulk velocities are lowest , with a quasi - thermal distribution . in higher power jets , a significant fraction of the particles",
    "are accelerated into a power - law tail , however in sgr a * this seems to be less of an effect .",
    "the particles in the jet radiatively cool via adiabatic expansion , the synchrotron process , and inverse compton upscattering ; however , adiabatic expansion is assumed to dominate the observed effects of cooling . because sgr a * has no `` standard thin accretion disk '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nor even a fossil disk , which would be apparent in the infrared @xcite , the photon field for inverse compton upscattering is entirely dominated by locally produced synchrotron photons .",
    "[ fig : sgraquiet ] shows an example of the resulting broadband spectrum plotted against the data for sgr a*.    besides those mentioned above , the other main fitted parameters are the ratio of length of the nozzle to its radius @xmath26 , the electron temperature @xmath27 , the inclination angle between the jet axis and line of sight @xmath28 and the equipartition parameter between the magnetic field and the radiating ( lepton ) particle energy densities , @xmath29 .    aside from sgr a * , this class of model has been successfully applied to several lhs xrbs ( @xcite ; gallo et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and",
    "other llagn ( @xcite ; filho et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    ", markoff et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "as would be expected from the existence of the fundamental plane , all significantly sub - eddington accreting black holes do seem to share some basic underlying physics across the mass scale .",
    "however , as mentioned above , sgr a * does not participate in the radio / x - ray correlation and can only be reconciled into this picture if significant particle acceleration is lacking .",
    "this is a very interesting point , because the appearance ( or non - appearance ) of a jet is strongly dependent on its internal particle distributions .",
    "a power - law tail of accelerated particles results in more optically thin synchrotron emission over a broader frequency range from each jet increment .",
    "thus when observing at a single frequency , a larger range of increments are able to contribute to the profile , resulting in a larger jet image , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : model3comp ] .",
    "in order to break the current degeneracy based on modeling the spectral data alone , we are for the first time calculating the predicted size and morphology of jet models which give a good description of the broadband data .",
    "after convolving these `` maps '' with the scattering screen , we then compare the results to closure quantities from vlbi , which provide information about the structure .",
    "the model predictions are analyzed in the same way as the observations .",
    "the 41 models presented here were chosen to represent a range which samples the full parameter space within the constraints of a reasonably good ( @xmath30 ) description of the radio through ir .",
    "for quiescent models , they are further constrained to fall within a factor of a few under the x - ray quiescent limits from _",
    "chandra_. flaring models are those which can account for either the average daily flaring flux or the highest detected with _",
    "chandra _ in the x - ray band , via some form of heating , accelerating or increased power compared to the quiescent state .",
    "we initially conducted a very rough search of a large region of parameter space for the first 20 models , then focused on a smaller region to explore properties nearest the best - fitting models , as well as for flares . a systematic exploration of the parameter space would be at least a 6 dimensional parameter cube , which we deemed too computationally intensive for this initial test study .    because there is still significant uncertainty about what to consider the `` quiescent '' versus `` flared '' ir flux amplitude and slope",
    ", we did not include the ir in the @xmath31 calculation but rather required the model to fall reasonably within range of the errors .",
    "the inability to constrain the exact ir and x - ray quiescent flux accounts for almost all of the allowed range in the fitted parameters for the quiescent state , otherwise the parameters would be fairly tightly determined . in this way",
    "the addition of morphological fitting can constrain the quiescent contribution above the submm band .",
    "we also compared our models to the simultaneous radio through ir data set presented in @xcite , and found the level agreement between the two data sets so good that we did not feel it provided an additional constraint .",
    "one of our secondary goals was to explore observable differences in the photosphere during flaring states .",

    "the peaks seen at 0/180/360@xmath114 suggest that even with the poorest resolution , the asymmetry is too great to be consistent with those directions .",

    "[ fig : scat1 ] demonstrates the clear selection of compact jets ( whose smallest scale is the nozzle radius @xmath21 ) and high inclination angles . a much more stringent constraint than the spectrum alone is the combined effect of these two parameters on the jet profile .",
    "while any compact nozzle less than several @xmath14 , or inclination above @xmath121 , is acceptable spectrally , the high level of symmetry required by the vlbi data strongly favors the most compact jets which are the most beamed out of the line of sight .",
    "because the jets are mildly accelerating , the beaming - induced `` dimming '' increases along the jet axes , thus emphasizing the less elongated nozzle regions .",
    "these results are also a reassuring confirmation because it would be surprising and somewhat alarming if the jets were so misaligned as to be pointing significantly towards the galactic plane in which we roughly sit .",

    "the most important conclusion of this paper is that a jet model , with reasonable physical assumptions about its geometry and internal physics , is capable of explaining the radio through ir ( and higher , during flares ) spectrum of sgr a * and _ not be visible at all to us as an object with jet - like morphology ! _ aside from the overall low jet power , the lack of significant particle acceleration implied by sgr a * s ir spectrum would predict extremely compact jet profiles .",
    "our results demonstrate that the lack of an imaged jet in sgr a * is not necessarily due to any absence , but rather stems from a very compact , weak source combined with the rather extreme scatter broadening by galactic electrons , and limits on our spatial resolution , especially in the n - s direction .",
    "however , even without being able to detect a fully elongated structure , the combination of spectral fitting with constraints from comparison with vlbi morphology can significantly limit the acceptable range of parameter space for jet models of sgr a*. figures [ fig : scat1][fig : scat4 ] visually demonstrate these new limits , which are successful despite the preliminary exploration of all parameter space .",
    "not altogether surprisingly , the additional inclusion of size constraints from vlbi places tighter limits on the model geometry . for instance , while fitting the quiescent spectrum can only limit the inclination angle to @xmath129 , the addition of vlbi data in indicates a very clear preference for @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , the size constraints from vlbi also narrow the range in jet nozzle size from @xmath131 to @xmath132 with the best fits at the smaller end . in the context of jet models",
    ", this would require jet launching to occur very close to the black hole , within the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "size constraints also indicate that vlbi data can already begin to constrain the orientation of jets on the sky .",
    "the best fit is found over a narrow range @xmath133 centered at @xmath134 , in a region where the resolution of the vlbi is good enough to begin discerning the asymmetry .",
    "the preferred pa is interesting , in that it could be related to the average position angle of the electromagnetic fields and thus give further clues about jet geometry .",
    "recent observations of variable linear polarization by @xcite and @xcite observed pa changes of @xmath135 over timescales of days to months .",
    "infrared measurements of the polarization during flares also show significant variability @xcite .",
    "the variability is most likely intrinsic , although there may be a favored or mean intrinsic polarization pa in the various wavelengths , though currently they do not seem to agree with each other .",
    "confirming both angles may ultimately provide important information about the helicity of the magnetic field threading the jets , or near the black hole .",
    "in addition , figs .  [",
    "fig : chi2p]-[fig : chi2 ] clearly indicate a dramatic difference in the goodness - of - fit between quiescent and flaring models for sgr a*. this is because the mechanisms involved in creating the flares @xcite are either heating or accelerating the radiating particles , which alters the optical depth and changes the jet profile on the sky .",
    "our results strongly argue for further simultaneous x - ray and vlbi ( eventually preferentially in the millimeter regime ) monitoring of sgr a * , where these methods can strongly limit the contributions of acceleration and heating , respectively .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that the combination of broadband spectral and morphological constraints gives encouraging and interesting limits on jet models ( or any model ) which can not be obtained by spectral fitting alone . in particular , the current difficulty in constraining the high - energy contribution of the jets because of the dominant quiescent thermal x - ray emission highlights the need for new approaches . including constraints from vlbi images",
    "offers a powerful method to break the current degeneracy in theoretical models for sgr a * s emission , as well as better constraint individual models themselves .    at 43 ghz and below , the key outstanding problem is to measure the two dimensional structure of sgr a*. this requires a careful selection of north - south baselines that are sensitive to structure on the scale of a few hundred micro - arcseconds .",
    "however , it is important to note that electron scattering still acts to symmetrize the data at 43 ghz , thus mm / submm vlbi could be even more revealing for these types of studies .",
    "the advantage may , however , be offset by the fact that higher frequencies probe even smaller scales in the jets , which would be predicted to be as symmetric as an accretion flow .",
    "on the other hand , mm / submm vlbi will bring us to scales comparable to those probed by the ir / x - ray flares .",
    "while this will allow us to better observe simultaneous flares in all three frequency bands , it also raises the question of how to distinguish the base region of a jet from an accretion flow . by identifying structural changes in morphology with spectral changes in a flare",
    ", the approach presented in this paper will be able to constrain the geometry , particle distributions and emission mechanisms contributing to the flares .",
    "finally we emphasize that the results presented here do not include modifications due to general relativistic effects near the black hole .",
    "for the current resolutions this may not be critical , but as we probe closer to the innermost regions with higher frequencies , this clearly needs to be taken into account ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
