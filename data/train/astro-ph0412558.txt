    "an intense gamma - ray burst , grb030329 , allowed us to carry out the very detailed observations of optical , x - ray , and radio counterparts to the burst .",
    "its photometry and spectroscopy led to the separation between the afterglow and sn contributions @xcite .",
    "the sn component is similar to sn 1998bw ; an unusual type ic sn @xcite .",
    "it makes clear that at least some grbs arise from core - collapse sne .",
    "grb030329 was seen as a double - pulsed burst with the total duration time of @xmath1630 sec @xcite .",
    "its total isotropic energy is @xmath17 erg .",
    "the grbs with known redshifts distribute the emission energy @xmath18 over the wide range of energy such as @xmath19 erg @xmath20erg@xcite .",
    "the duration times of grbs extend from @xmath1610ms to @xmath21 sec@xcite .",
    "the light curves of grbs show really various profiles . however , to fully understand the emission mechanisms of the observed @xmath22-ray bursts and of the afterglows one must have a firm handle on the generation process of the @xmath22-ray bust .    the fireball model of the @xmath22-ray bust has succeeded in understanding the characteristics of some light profiles of grbs @xcite .",
    "its model was proposed to solve the compactness problem , that is , to understand both the short time variation of @xmath22-ray radiation and the optically thin process in the emitting region of the @xmath22-ray photons @xcite .",
    "the solution of the fireball model requires the beaming jets with the emitting region relativistically moving to our direction .",
    "the two processes are proposed for the formation of the jets , one is the magnetohydrodynamical process @xcite , and the other is the neutrino process @xcite .",
    "further more the two different roles are expected for the neutrinos to form the jets .",
    "the frequent collisions between neutrinos and antineutrinos produce the fireball with light elements which expands relativistically in a funnel around a rotation axis .",
    "the other role is the acceleration of plasmas by the collisions of neutrinos with nucleons or electrons , which produces the neutrino driven jets .",
    "the sufficient collisions between @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the central region of the accretion disk were proposed by @xcite .",
    "they assumed the accretion disk is optically thin for the transfer of neutrinos .",
    "but , @xcite showed that the accretion disk becomes optically thick for neutrino transfer and then the neutrinos trapped in the matter fall into a black hole .",
    "however , the composition of accreting matter should be carefully considered .",
    "the production rates of neutrinos and their opacities directly depend on the density of free nucleons .",
    "@xcite were thought in question whether the neutrinos can cool the accretion disk .",
    "they treated the accreting material in @xmath25 equilibrium and showed that there exist just a small number of free nucleons and then the neutrino processes are no longer effective in cooling of the disk .",
    "this result is in a striking contrast to the previous works on the accretion disk in which the material almost consists of free nucleons produced by the photodisintegration process and the dominant cooling was carried out by neutrinos .",
    "material at high temperature @xmath26k becomes in nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "its composition of material depends on the number ratio of photon to baryon , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number densities of photons and baryons @xcite .",
    "if @xmath31 is large , @xmath32 , the baryons form a dissociated gas of nucleons and alpha particles . however ,",
    "if @xmath31 is of order unity or less , iron - group nuclei are typically favored .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 is expressed as @xmath33 in terms of the temperature @xmath34 in units of @xmath35k and the density @xmath36 in units of @xmath37g/@xmath9 . in the case of a typical accretion with @xmath38/sec and @xmath39 , the temperature and",
    "the density become are @xmath40(k ) and @xmath41(g/@xmath9 ) at the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "then the values of @xmath31 become as @xmath42 .",
    "one should treat the accreting matter with a large abundance of heavy nuclei .",
    "we determine the densities of free neutron and proton , alpha particle , and heavy nuclei by using the equation of state for hot , dense matter given by @xcite .",
    "the changes of lepton number per a baryon , @xmath43 , are calculated through the reactions of neutrinos with these baryons .",
    "the thermal equilibrium structure of the accretion disk should be determined in the frame of a general relativity .",
    "@xcite showed that the core - collapse in the evolved star with the main sequence mass , @xmath44 , forms a black hole at the center with the rotating disk balanced with gravity when the evolved star has the some large specific angular momentum .",
    "then the specific angular momentum parameter @xmath45 of the falling matter into a black hole becomes larger to be @xmath46 .",
    "the falling velocity of the rotating disk is required to be very small in comparison with light velocity , since the time duration of some grbs is a few seconds , i.e. , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the gravitational radius of a black hole and @xmath49 is the light velocity .",
    "the accretion disk with slow falling velocity should be investigated in the frame of rotating spacetime .",
    "the heating rate due to viscosity is proportional to the shear stress @xmath50 . in the static spacetime",
    "its stress increases with the differential rotation of the accreting flow @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angular velocity of the falling flow . in the rotating spacetime the differential rotation of the fluid observed in the frame co - rotating with spacetime",
    "is physically meaningful @xcite . in the extreme kerr",
    "the relative angular velocity @xmath53 has the maximum at the radius @xmath54 when @xmath52 is the angular velocity of the keplerian orbit and @xmath55 is the angular velocity of spacetime .",
    "it is convenient for the analysis of energy balance and of the transfer of angular momentum to introduce the orbiting frame with orthogonal tetrad which rotates with keplarian velocity . in this paper",
    "the shear stress @xmath50 and the transfer of angular momentum are solved by using the orbiting frame .",
    "the power by advection contributes seriously to the energy balance in the accretion disk .",
    "the previous works on the accretion disk with neutrino loss had been studied in the frame of an advection - dominated accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the role of the advection in the energy balance depends on the velocity profile since the power by the advection is expressed as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the pressure and velocity of the flow .",
    "when @xmath59 , the accreting matter is cooled by the expansion of fluid . on the other hand when @xmath60 , it is heated by the compression like as in the core - collapse in a supernova explosion .",
    "the radial velocity profile of the accreting flow is determined by the energy balance of the disk and by the transfer of angular momentum .",
    "the scale height at the inner portion of the disk with the temperature @xmath61k is very thin .",
    "the angular velocity of the accretion disk is then approximated to be keplerian . we determine the radial profile of the velocity by solving the transfer of angular momentum with the thermal energy balance of the disk and evaluate the efficiency of advection in the energy balance .",
    "the thermal stability of the accretion disk might depend on the scattering optical depth of @xmath5 .",
    "the thermal energy in the disk is carried out mainly by @xmath5 .",
    "the collision frequency of @xmath5 with the nucleons or electrons reaches to @xmath62 within the disk for the typical case of the accretion .",
    "the escaping time from the disk is then @xmath63(ms ) , where @xmath64 is the height of the disk .",
    "the thermal energy produced by viscous heating stays within the disk in the time @xmath65 and might induce the thermal instability .",
    "we shall briefly analyze the thermal instability .",
    "if the luminosity of each flavor of neutrino and its mean energy are observed the physics of grbs will be cleared .",
    "we shall calculate the luminosity @xmath66 and the mean energy @xmath67 for each type of neutrino @xmath68 emitted from the accretion disk .",
    "the diagram determining the mass of a central black hole , @xmath69 , and its specific angular momentum , @xmath45 , from the observations of neutrinos is presented .    in this paper",
    "we study the accretion of hot dense matter onto a black hole . in sect .",

    "the cross sections of neutrinos , opacities , emission rates and the reaction rates of neutrinos are summarized in tables , which are shown in appendix .",
    "it is important for the study of thermal and dynamical properties of massive accretion disks precisely to determine the fraction of free nucleons in the accreting matter .",
    "its fraction provides the emissivities and absorptions of neutrinos .",
    "the mass fraction of free nucleons depends on the photon - to - baryon ratio @xmath70@xcite , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is avogadro s number .",
    "we compute @xmath70 in terms of the temperature @xmath73 and density @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the helicity for photons .",
    "we evaluate the ratio @xmath70 for the neutrino dominated accreting flow ( ndaf ) given by @xcite .",
    "the loci of ndaf with @xmath77sec@xmath2 and the contours of @xmath78 in the @xmath74  @xmath73 plane are shown in fig 1 .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 on the flow is @xmath79 , showing little number density of photons . on the other hand",
    "the previous works on ndaf without @xcite adopted the approximate formula for the mass fraction of free nucleons , @xmath80 , @xcite : @xmath81 the contour of @xmath82 is also plotted in fig .",
    "1 . at the inner side of ndaf its fraction , @xmath80 , reaches to unity .",
    "we also calculated the flow profile of the standard accretion disk with the keplerian angular momentum in which the fraction of free nucleons is provided through this formula , @xmath80 .",
    "the accreting velocity of the standard disk is much less than that of ndaf , which produces the denser profile of the accretion flow for the same accretion rate , @xmath83sec@xmath2 .",
    "then its ratio @xmath70 is very minute , @xmath84 .",
