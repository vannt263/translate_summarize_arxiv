    "recent developements in the nano - fabrication technique have made the 1d interacting electron systems an experimental reality , and its quantum transport properties have been the subject of extensive studies both experimentally [ 1 - 3 ] and theoretically [ 4 - 16 ] . in realistic experimental set - ups ,",

    "calculation of the conductance suppressed by a weak random impurity potential in this model @xcite had agreed with both the previous theoretical prediction @xcite and an experiment @xcite .    in this paper",

    "@xcite succeeded in introducing the 1d periodic potential with a periodicity of order 40 nm into the wire 2@xmath16 m in length and 50 nm wide .",
    "this induces umklapp scattering .",
    "the electron density @xmath17 can be continuously controlled by the gate voltage , and one can satisfy the half - filling condition within an accessible value of @xmath17 . if this condition is satisfied the system will becomes a 1d ( doped ) mott insulator with the mott - hubbard gap @xmath18 for the infinite length wire .",
    "then it will offer an idealistic system to study the quantum transport in mott and doped mott insulators in 1d .",

    "expected when the screening length @xmath35 of the interaction determined by the close metallic gates is much larger than the width of the channel @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite , we predict a few more threshold singularities . these features could be observed experimentally by changing the gate voltage , bias voltage , and temperature .    in the next section iv , motivated by a recent discussion @xcite that in a non - perturbative case of the large mott - hubbard gap @xmath38 the conductance",
    "is strongly suppressed at any low energy ( < @xmath18 ) inside the gap similar to the band gap case , we consider transport through a 1d mott - hubbard insulator of a finite length @xmath1 beyond perturbative approach .",

    "this asymptotics gives an adequate description of the whole high temperature region @xmath304 while a high energy value of @xmath29 was about 1/2 .",
    "then it complies with the high temperature conductance ( [ 9 ] ) we have found in the previous section . at others values of @xmath29 we would expect the conductance changing its behavior from ( [ 9 ] ) to ( [ 46 ] ) as @xmath29 is scaling with lowering the temperature .",
    "this crossover could result in a non- monotonous dependence of the conductance on the temperature , since at high energy @xmath231 we have seen that the conductance is increasing with decrease of the temperature .",
    "2._low energies _ @xmath191 - to find a low energy model for our problem we have to integrate out all high energy modes .",

    "it leads us to the problem of one impurity in the tll .    for the weak backscattering",
    ", the lagrangian of this problem can be written as @xmath307 where we rescaled @xmath306 back and introduced a new energy cut - off parameter @xmath308 with dimensionless constant @xmath309 which will be specified later .",

    "the appropriate lagrangian reads @xmath314 with @xmath315 proportional to the free massive fermion transmittance and the voltage multiplied by @xmath29 factor @xcite .",
    "both these lagrangian are , indeed , equivalent @xcite if interaction dependent relation between @xmath310 and @xmath316 is met @xcite .",
    "the above model ( [ 47 ] ) or([48 ] ) characterizes the point scatterer of any backscattering strength at low energy @xcite .",
    "although , the exact relation between @xmath310 or @xmath316 and the bare parameters of the scatterer remains unknown .",
    "our problem is dually symmetrical to that of kane and fisher : suppression of the direct current in their problem equals suppression of the backscattering one in our case .",
    "this correspondence allows us to re - write their solution@xcite as follows : @xmath317 where @xmath318 denotes the digamma function and satisfies : @xmath319 , and a new energy scale @xmath237 @xcite varies from @xmath320 at the weak backscattering ( [ 47 ] ) to @xmath321 at the strong one ( [ 48 ] ) .",
    "let us , first , compare this result with the perturbative one @xcite of the previous section .",
    "the latter was derived making use of the long - time asymptotics for the correlator ( [ 6 ] ) : @xmath322 where @xmath323 and @xmath324 was simplified in the previous section as : @xmath325^{gr}$ ] and @xmath326 .",
    "one can see that substitution of this asymptotics in the whole formal series for the backscattering current discussed above implies transformation of the lagrangian ( [ 41 ] ) into the one of ( [ 47 ] ) with the coefficient for the @xmath327-term : @xmath328 instead of @xmath329 and another energy cut - off @xmath221 .",
    "this model would be equivalent to that we constructed before in the weak perturbative regime if we can meet @xmath330 at zero @xmath331 it exactly specifies @xmath309 as a constant on the order of 1 .",
    "however , if @xmath332 ( @xmath333 for @xmath248 we assumed ) , @xmath309 increases @xmath334 at large @xmath335 .",
    "moreover , there is a mismatching between the oscillating structures of @xmath336 and @xmath337 which can not be naturally accounted for by a smooth variation of the energy cut - off , but sooner by a small deviation of the traversal time @xmath338 in the free electron reflection coefficient ( [ 44 ] ) from its bare value @xmath339 as @xmath16 changes .",
    "such behavior results from penetration of the interaction inside the wire .",
    "it is described by the finite reflection coefficient @xmath331 in the inhomogeneous tll model .",
    "the phenomenon is more important for @xmath340 when the electron propagation through the wire is not suppressed . in the opposite regime of small",
    "@xmath341 no interference structure is expected and @xmath309 remains constant . finally , under this choice ( [ 410 ] ) of @xmath309 one can see that @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , the solution ( [ 411 ] ) coincides with the perturbative result ( [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] ) that is @xmath343 and @xmath344 .    turning to the case @xmath345",
    "we can not use the perturbative expression ( [ 410 ] ) anymore : the perturbative series is not convergent due to a finite gap creation . then above non - perturbative consideration",
    "is necessary .",
    "application of the solution ( [ 411 ] ) in this case reveals a quite remarkable property of low energy transport through the mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "there is an exponentially small value of @xmath346 for @xmath243 .",
    "hence , the zero temperature current @xmath33 ( fig.[cn ] ) is not suppressed for the voltage less than @xmath237 and saturates at @xmath347 value when @xmath348 .",
    "similarly , the conductance ( fig.[cty ] ) displays a small decrease @xmath349 below its zero temperature value @xmath102 with increase of @xmath20 for @xmath350 and approaches its exponentially small asymptotics @xmath351 above @xmath352 . as @xmath246 increases ,",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath353 on the fermi level goes down and @xmath237 exceeds @xmath221 , finally , approaching its weak backscattering value @xmath354 , where the perturbative consideration is applicable .    in summary , we studied transport through a 1d mott - hubbard insulator beyond perturbative approach . assuming that @xmath248 near the half - filling in agreement with the bethe ansatz solutions we mapped the problem onto the exactly solvable models and found current vs. voltage at high temperature @xmath40 and at low energy @xmath41 .",
    "the solution of these models shows , in particularly , that the high - temperature transport through the mott - hubbard insulator is similar to the one through the band gap insulator at @xmath248 . at low energies ,",
    "however , there is always a regime where the transport remains non - suppressed in the absence of the impurity backscattering . for the strong interaction resulting in the opening of the large mott - hubbard gap",
