    "for students to be successful problem solvers , it is not enough to think just about the features of the physical system .",
    "they also need to coordinate different representations by thinking conceptually about the mathematical representations that satisfy the physical system , evaluating the algorithmic steps , and reflect upon their work .",
    "unsurprisingly , students often have trouble unifying these ideas for productive problem solving .",
    "researchers in student understanding of quantum mechanics have used a  difficulties \" framework to understand student reasoning ( e.g. @xcite ) , which forms long lists of difficulties that span many topics in quantum mechanics .",
    "research have detailed lists of student difficulties in determining the time dependency of stationary , superposed , and degenerate eigenfunctions@xcite ; the effect of time dependency of different physical systems on the probability densities @xcite ; energy measurements of a quantum mechanical system@xcite ; concepts of time dependent schrdinger equations@xcite ; and the role of hamiltonian physics in determining energy.@xcite    however , we posit that these disparate difficulties can be unified through the lens of epistemological framing@xcite , and errors in frame transitions @xcite .",
    "epistemological frames reveal students@xcite ways of thinking and expectations .",
    "they govern which ideas students link together and utilize to solve problems .",
    "careful observation of student behaviors , gaze , and discourse can provide clues for determining students epistemological frames .",
    "productive problem solving requires both an appropriate frame @xcite and appropriate transitions between frames@xcite .    some students , despite having strong numerical tools or knowledge ,",
    "still `` get stuck '' in certain problem solving situations@xcite .",
    "this happens particularly in upper division courses , where mathematics is critical to understanding of the subject , such as quantum mechanics .",
    "bing et al@xcite identified four epistemic frames to aid understanding the role of math as a reasoning tool versus a numerical tool .",
    "they analyzed students thinking while the students translate physical ideas into informative mathematical forms , or compare a mathematical structure in two similar physics or math scenarios .",
    "though bing et al identified `` physical mapping '' , and `` math consistency '' frames , their `` calculation '' frame is biased toward the use of formal math , independent of physical sense making .",
    "however , they did not further differentiate between trivial math calculations and conceptual math reasoning .    on the other hand , kuo et al @xcite differentiated between the use of equations as an input - output calculator template , versus attending to the conceptual meaning embedded in the equation to create shortcuts .",
    "they referred to `` cognitive elements '' @xcite to capture students understanding of equations while they blend their reasoning with symbolic forms and create a shortcut to interpret the situation .",
    "they concluded that successful problem solvers are able to make a decision as to which tools they bring into play for an efficient understanding of the problem situation .",
    "earlier studies identified other possible avenues that students may follow to obtain a correct solution by using conceptual physics and algorithmic math as a numerical tool .",
    "these problem solving studies often focused on the differences between experts and novices@xcite . a novice adopts an inverse strategy by simply attending to the goal of the problem , recalling and manipulating an equation that contains the unknown quantities .",
    "in contrast , an expert moves forward based on having a representation for the situation , and then choosing the relevant principles@xcite .",
    "however , this study is limited because experts expertise far exceeds the difficulty of the end - of - chapter problems , and so study can not show the heuristics of expert - like problem solvers .",
    "heller et al @xcite designed context - rich problems to challenge students beyond end - of - chapter exercises .",
    "this method requires students to make sense of the physical system , and justify what strategies to adopt as experts do .",
    "their framework assesses how students initially translate the problem statement into a visual representation in order to help them to adopt a proper strategy for determining the implicit unknown physical quantities .",
    "the strategy would allow them to translate their physical representation into a mathematical representation in order to do the algorithmic steps , find the unknown quantity to make sense of their solution . while this strategy was initially quite prescriptive in the nature and order of the problem solving steps , later research",
    "has permitted a less - linear structure to problem solving .",
    "building on this work at the introductory level , caballero et al @xcite developed a framework to explain the common difficulties of upper level division students in problem solving , focusing on four steps in mathematical tool use : activation , construction , execution , and reflection .",
    "these steps could be completed in any order , and solutions may vary among students and problems .",
    "one student could stay mostly in the execution phase to process the algorithmic steps .",
    "another student might evaluate the solution by staying in the construction phase and skipping the execution elements in favor of conceptual steps , or one could bring into play both components of execution and construction .",
    "students use of certain elements of this framework does not necessarily imply difficulties with the missing component of their problem solving process .",
    "this could become important when the problem statement of the question frames the situation toward the use of one of these four components more pronounced than the others .",
    "broadly speaking , these three literatures ",
    "research into student difficulties in quantum mechanics , research into epistemological framing , and research into student problem solving  suggest several approaches for understanding how students understand quantum mechanics problems .",
    "one approach may consider the initial physical understanding of the problem as more critical , with less emphasis on the mathematical manipulations , whereas other approaches may consider equally a close relation between math and physics , or in particular focus on conceptual meaning of math in blending reasoning .",
    "our present study integrates these three literatures to capture the various facets of students framing and problem solving .",
    "our framework takes up the idea of epistemic frames to explain student problem solving without prescribed steps , and provides an underlying structure to explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    "we develop a two - axis framework which models students framing in math and physics , expanded through the algorithmic and conceptual space of students problem solving .",
    "we investigate four frames : algorithmic math , conceptual math , algorithmic physics , and conceptual physics , looking for moments where students problem solving is impeded because they are in an unproductive frame .",
    "we applied this framework to our own data to show the application of this framework for describing observational data from quantum mechanics classes .",
    "our purpose is to illustrate the framework , not to exhaustively show the prevalence of specific frames or to catalog the methods by which students may transition between them .",
    "we then present a mapping of over thirty quantum mechanics difficulties from the literature to the framework .",
    "this secondary analysis provides a deeper underlying structure to the reported difficulties .",
    "this demonstrates the broad applicability of our framework to many kinds of quantum mechanics student data .",
    "we video recorded the class meetings of one semester of a senior - level quantum mechanics class .",
    "the class is taught using griffith s introduction to quantum mechanics@xcite using a wavefunctions - first topic order .",
    "it meets for four 50-minute sessions each week . during class",
    ", lecture is interspersed with small group problem solving .",
    "groups of 2 - 3 students solve problems collaboratively on shared table - based whiteboards .",
    "most problem - solving sessions last 2 - 5 minutes , though they can be as long as 15 minutes for more difficult problems .",
    "students are remarkably collaborative , usually working together for the entire duration of each problem - solving session . in our data set , we see about one problem - solving session per class , though this decreases in frequency near the end of the semester .    generally , these problem - solving sessions begin when the professor halts the lecture to ask the students to attempt to solve a problem related to their current topic , or to introduce a new topic .",
    "occasionally , they also arise when students initiate a class discussion and the professor decides to assign a problem to gauge their understanding .",
    "the groups in this class are somewhat fluid , and students may form different groups on different days .",
    "students occasionally recruit others from nearby groups to help them solve problems . the instructor does not explicitly tell students where to sit or with whom to work ( other than with `` people near you '' ) .",
    "we are interested in students problem solving activities in quantum mechanics . in learning environments such as group problem solving in upper division contexts , one way to interpret the high level of interactions within group members is to carefully analyze the discourse and gestures of each member of the group .",
    "ethnography provides an opportunity to understand the detail of students discourse , behaviors , and any useful information while they are investigating a phenomena@xcite .",
    "one of the methods for data collection in ethnography studies in through video recording of activities .",
    "this becomes more important in science by providing multiple researchers an opportunity to view and analyze the videos@xcite .",
    "previous researchers in education have used ethnography to study the culture of classroom activities @xcite or even in more engaging learning environments , such as advanced physics laboratory @xcite .",
    "our goal was to develop a framework to enable us to explain problem solving within various topics in quantum mechanics .",
    "we divide class into episodes of problem solving and episodes of lecture , discarding episodes of lecture because they do nt help us understand student reasoning .",
    "the problem solving episodes have distinct boundaries : they start with the professor explicitly asking students to begin working on their table - based whiteboards and end when the professor either asks for answers or begins explaining the answer .    in our preliminary analysis of the students group problem - solving activities",
    ", we observed that some aspects of the data represent a conceptual approach and other aspects represent an algorithmic approach .",
    "we also noticed students use of conceptual physics and algorithmic math .",
    "this distinction is consistent with the acer@xcite and framing@xcite literature on problem solving from upper - division physics classes , showing how students understanding of physical systems maps to algorithmic representations .",
    "however , neither framework adequately captured the richness of our data , prompting us to take further steps to interpret our data set . from the tradition of progressive refinement of hypotheses@xcite , we set out to refine our observations through close interrogation of the video data",
    ".    we started with selecting episode for close analysis based on their duration ( longer is better ) , conceptual richness ( more complex is better ) , and technical quality ( more visible and audible are better ) .",
    "we reflected on these episodes , seeking to answer `` what s going on ? '' for each of them .",
    "through repeated watching and examining the details of the selected episodes , we sought to capture changes in students discussion or behavior that might indicate a shift in the students problem solving processes .",
    "we began to focus on instances where students `` got stuck '' in their problem solving processes .",
    "this momentary impasse prompted them to try a different kind of reasoning until suddenly they were able to get `` un - stuck '' .",
    "we examined the interactions immediately preceding and following the unsticking moments to look for regularities in unsticking behavior .",
    "we developed a preliminary framework@xcite which mapped student behavior onto three frames : conceptual physics , conceptual math , and algorithmic math .",
    "the two math frames  concordant with research in mathematics education on concepts and processes@xcite  suggested that we reframe our framework into two orthogonal axes : conceptual to algorithmic and math to physics . in pursuit of evidence to refine this two - axis framework , we delved again into our observational data , seeking examples of all four quadrants and transitions among them .",
    "after several more iterative cycles of analysis and refinement , we reached a stable point where new episodes did not change the framework or our application of it . operating with the newly - stable framework ,",
    "two independent raters came to consensus on every episode ; two additional raters checked a selection of episodes with agreement of @xmath0 .",
    "we selected episodes for analysis based on frequency of students discussion regarding concepts and processes , as well as displays and features of potential frame transitions .",
    "we categorized episodes with conceptually rich discussions and frame negotiations as strong examples , and established inter - rater reliability about the content of the episodes and regarding which episodes strongly or weakly evidenced frame transitions .",
    "we also identified very weak examples when it was hard to find evidence of students framing from the group discussion .",
    "this could happen due to noisy or garbled audio , or when students were writing on part of the whiteboard that was not in the view of the camera , or in general did nt have enough information to determine students framing .",
    "once we identified students frames , we looked for transitions in frames to help us to interpret the dynamic of students problem solving behaviors or identify the impasse students reach when they fail to notice certain factors that could have triggered a transition to a more appropriate state .    with a robust framework that matched our observational data",
    "well , we turned to the research literature on student difficulties in quantum mechanics to see if it would fit others descriptions of their data ( section [ sec : secondary ] ) .",
    "we are interested to see how students think about math and physics and apply their reasoning in order to find and justify an answer to a quantum problem . having an axis , rather than discrete categories @xcite ,",
    "enable us to observe fine variations in students behaviors . also , whenever students are on the extreme side of the axis more features of each discrete frame are observed .",
    "our two axis framework consists of an algorithmic versus conceptual axis , and a math versus physics axis ( figure [ fig : framework ] .    ]",
    "the two independent axes divide different aspects of students problem solving into four frames : algorithmic math , conceptual math , algorithmic physics , and conceptual physics .",
    "students enter an algorithmic math frame when the problem statement requires explicit algorithmic calculations to find an answer .",
    "students will spend a considerable amount of time to set up a series of algebra - based steps to evaluate integrals , take derivatives , or simplify their solution .",
    "algorithmic math can be a quick and powerful problem - solving mindset as they may take several fast steps over a long period of time .",
    "however , without other quadrants it is quite difficult to check whether or not the solution makes sense .",
    "this frame leaves students with a narrow@xcite discussion mostly to check the signs , or to alert each other of the missing symbols in their numerical calculations . for these features ,",
    "we consider that the `` just math '' frame@xcite is an example of students prolonged use of the algorithmic math frame .    in contrast , a conceptual math frame is more expansive : students apply practical ideas about the behavior of the mathematical functions , set terms equal to zero , or determine the result of an operation without actually computing it .",
    "they make sense of the situation by applying conceptual reasoning based on their previous expectations of the problems .",
    "creating a `` shortcut '' solution to the problem lessens the writing and gives more opportunity for making sense in their discussions with other members of the group .",
    "attention to conceptual mathematics is a large part of numeracy , and as such is an important part of learning mathematics@xcite and physics@xcite , especially at the upper - division@xcite .",
    "the combination of the same horizontal axis with the physics side of the vertical axis forms the algorithmic physics frame and conceptual physics frame .",
    "students in the algorithmic physics frame tend to recall equations , facts , and properties of physical quantities without conceptual justifications .",
    "they use math as a tool to check the correctness of the physical quantities in the problem , or to adjust equations via a series of algebra - based steps to relate physics quantities to each other .",
    "however , in the conceptual physics frame , students think expansively about the properties of the physical quantities related to the physical features of the system , and attend to the underlying concepts to provide a representation of the situation , coordinate between representations , or link other concepts to the problem at hand .",
    "the more they think conceptually about the physics of the situation , the more they gain insight about the real system .",
    "it is important to note that none of these frames are inherently `` good '' , `` bad '' , or productive . at different times",
    ", different frames may be productively used to solve problems in physics , and often more complicated problems require multiple transitions between frames . in the remainder of this section , we illustrate each of the four frames using excerpts from our data .    ]    ]      most of the examples in this section are chosen from the same physics context of the free particle system , so we review the physics of this system briefly for the reader .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the free particle is characterized by a zero potential energy , and only empty space in all directions . while this is not physically realizable ",
    "there ca nt be empty space everywhere ",
    "it is a useful construct for understanding basic properties of the wave function and the schrdinger equation , and a reasonable approximation of a single particle far enough from any other potential .",
    "because there is no potential to constrain the particle , its wave function must be uniform over all space .",
    "furthermore , the lack of bounds implies there will be no decaying exponential terms and the wave function will consist solely of a superposition of standing waves .    because the hamiltonian has only the kinetic energy term , the time independent schrdinger ( tise ) equation results in a homogeneous second - order differential equation . in order to write",
    "the eigenvalue equation in terms of a differential equation students might need to recall some relations from algorithmic physics .",
    "solving and finding the wave function of the equation leaves room for either algorithmic math calculations , or conceptual math discussions .      before we present data ,",
    "here is a brief typographic note . in these interactions ,",
    "students very frequently speak the names of mathematical symbols .",
    "we could have typeset their words as if they were equations or as if they were the names of isolated symbols .",
    "equations are more compact  importing algebra to europe caused a scientific revolution  but they lose some of the nuance of students speech .",
    "isolated symbol names , on the other hand , tend to be difficult to follow in text in a way that they are not difficult to follow in speech , especially as oftentimes students write as they speak . we have chosen a middle path , seeking to maximize clarity for the reader .    additionally , we typeset a comma for brief pauses , a period for longer ones , and ellipses (  ) for the longest ones .",
    "stage directions are denoted by parentheses .",
    "should we omit or alter some students speech for clarity , changed words are denoted by square brackets and omitted ones by ellipses in square brackets ( [  ] ) .      in this example",
    "a group of three students are solving the schrdinger equation to find the wave function of a free particle .",
    "adam and emma work together quickly to solve the problem , while their third groupmate ( eric ) stays silent .",
    "figure [ fig : snap ] shows a snapshot of their whiteboard during group problem solving , taken while emma is pointing to the both sides of their written equation to review the taken algorithmic steps in search for the missing sign .",
    "the numbers indicated on the figure show the order of the students actions and narrations and reference the numbers in the transcript below .",
    "figure [ fig : diag ] shows a transcript of their writing on the whiteboard .    in this problem",
    ", adam takes the derivative of the time solution of the schrdinger equation , and replaces it into the equation using the whiteboard in front of both students",
    ". he continues to replace the factors that the group has manipulated earlier in their solution and setting both sides of the equation equal to each other to verify if their solution satisfies the schrdinger equation .",
    "adam : :    minus @xmath1 equal emma : :    minus @xmath2 squares over two .",
    "( 1 ) adam : :    minus @xmath3 over @xmath2  squared  boom  boom     boom ( while canceling the same quantities from two sides of the    equation ) ( 2 ) emma : :    cancel , cancel , cancel , and we are off by a negative ( 2 ) adam : :    yeah [ unintelligible ] sign emma : :    with a negative up here , because these two are negative .",
    "adam : :    yeah",
    "that is true emma : :    so something happened here ( pointing to the two sides of their    equation ) ( 3 ) adam : :    or we lost a sign ( 3 )    emma and adam use short sentences and talk quickly to be able to proceed to the next step of their algorithmic evaluation .",
    "they speak primarily of mathematical terms and operations , and do not talk explicitly or extensively about the physical quantities these symbols represent . at the end , they come up with an extra negative sign in one side of their solution . after reviewing their solution , adam removes a negative sign in the earlier line of his solution , which he thinks is extra , but he does not further discuss the reason behind his decision , which suggests that students are in a narrow frame .      in this example , the same group is working on normalization of the free particle wave function by considering the general solution @xmath4 as the sum of two functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they initially set the algorithmic steps , take the modulus square of the wave function ( @xmath7 ) and insert the limits of the integral .",
    "@xmath8    there are a few errors in the students solution which will not affect their conceptual discussion later in the episode .",
    "emma leaves just one differential elements of length @xmath9 for the whole expression right after the last term in the integrand ( equation [ eqn:1 ] ) .",
    "however , emma is mindful of her incorrect notation , as she will take the integral of each term of the integrand with respect to @xmath10 in the following lines .",
    "the other error takes place after taking the integral of the @xmath11 : emma leaves an extra negative sign in the power of the exponential , and none of the group members notice the extra sign for the second exponential integral ( equation [ eqn:2 ] ) .",
    "eric notes that the result of the constant integrals are infinite ; emma will not further discuss and skip those terms in the last line of the solution .",
    "they end up with the variable @xmath10 in both the denominator and the power of the exponential function in the numerator of the fraction ( equation [ eqn:2 ] ) . without evaluating the integral numerically",
    ", they realize that the answer of the integrals might be infinite .",
    "they start in a conceptual conversation in the math context by arguing based on words and properties of the wave functions rather than working out equations to justify their answer as being finite .",
    "emma : :    we do nt have to worry , this [ the exponential term in the numerator ]    is gon na blow up faster than this [ the denominator ] , right !",
    "eric : :    they both blow up emma : :    yea , but one blows up faster and that matters adam : :    definitely the exponential ( points to numerator ) emma : :    yeah ",
    "emma has a discussion about which term `` blows up '' faster than the other .",
    "emma gives more evidence of her conceptual understanding of the behavior of the two functions in the second exponential integral , when eric says `` but both terms blow up '' .",
    "she then compares the decay rate of the functions as an important factor that `` matters '' .",
    "emma conveys her generalized expectation@xcite of the situation by saying `` we do nt have to worry '' .",
    "although emma only uses the term `` blow up '' briefly , there is a conceptual meaning embedded in this phrase which shows her understanding of the situation by comparing the rate .",
    "adam seems to agree with emma when pointing to the exponential function as blowing up faster .",
    "the instructor asks the students to solve the schrdinger equation to find the wave function for the free particle .",
    "robert begins to write down the time independent schrdinger equation .",
    "jack states he think it is time independent and the conversation begins .",
    "their arguments are based upon reasoning and discussion rather than working out specific equations :    alex : :    i think it is time independent .",
    "robert : :    yeah ?",
    "why do we need time ?",
    "alex : :    hmm ? because the wave function might have it .",
    "robert : :    if there is no force then  um  why would anything about the wave    function change over time ?",
    "alex : :    because the wave function might depend on time  from its initial    condition .",
    "robert : :    i do nt think it did .",
    "at least  [unintelligible ] .",
    "alex : :    oh , okay .",
    "robert refers to the properties of the physical system to reason that the wave function is time independent because there is no force acting on it , whereas alex has doubts about how the initial condition can affect the evolution of the system over time .",
    "however , alex does not have enough evidence to justify his reasoning .    in this episode , both students are in a conceptual physics frame , justifying their reasoning ( albeit briefly ) with arguments about physical quantities instead of mathematics or procedures , and bringing in more expansive reasoning .",
    "alex thinks in terms of the feature of the problem by mentioning the initial condition .",
    "thinking about the features of this problem also helps robert to set the force equal to zero .",
    "this helps him to think more deeply about the underlying concepts and justify a zero change of the wave function over time .",
    "in contrast to the prior example , here robert and alex shift into a more algorithmic frame .",
    "robert continues to rearrange the equation of the hamiltonian into kinetic and potential energy .",
    "he then sets the value of the potential energy equal to zero , and continue to recall the physical equations for the momentum based on the velocity and substitute them into the equations .",
    "robert : :    ( writing math as he speaks ) whole definition    is  @xmath12 ",
    "zero ( crosses out u ) is , uh    @xmath13 ",
    "@xmath14 squared .",
    "this is    @xmath15  @xmath16  and @xmath17 equals    @xmath18 so h is @xmath19 alex : :    you can have that @xmath20 equals  or @xmath21 equals    @xmath22 .",
    "it s skipping all of this .",
    "robert goes through multiple steps of algebra to remember the other physics equations in order to relate the kinetic energy to the momentum .",
    "however , alex directly recalls the equation of the kinetic energy in terms of the momentum .",
    "alex s framing is distinguished from algorithmic mathematics because he s not performing mathematical manipulations , merely recalling general physics formulae .",
    "robert is also in a recall mode , as evidenced by the words which start his observation : `` whole definition is '' . both of them together",
    "implicitly agree that the goal of this part of the interaction is to lay out physical laws using mathematical formalism , not to discuss the applicability of those laws or derive them from first principles , as evidenced by alex s comment that they can `` [ skip ] all of '' robert s more elaborate efforts .",
    "the idea of the two - axis framework is itself a development in how we model student thinking about math in physics contexts .",
    "however , only the briefest of problems ( heller & heller s `` exercises''@xcite ) require only one frame to solve them .",
    "to better model longer problems in upper - division physics , we must look at how students transition between frames in the course of problem solving .",
    "frame transitions  or inability to transition  in students problem solving illuminates the connections among ideas and procedures in longer problems , and may explain some student difficulties .",
    "we identify transitions by first identifying preceding and following frames .",
    "the transition , definitionally , occurs between two different frames . broadly speaking",
    ", we notice that the timing of transitions is relatively short ( on the order of a few seconds , less than length of a few turns at talk ) .      in the following example , the group transitions from a conceptual math frame to an algorithmic frame , which is a move from an expansive to a narrow frame .    in the previous class session",
    ", students discussed that the probability density of a stationary state is time independent . immediately prior to this example",
    ", the instructor asks the class to work in group and find if the probability density of a superposition of two stationary states ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) is time dependent or independent .",
    "as he introduces the problem , the instructor s framing prompts the students to start in either the math or physics conceptual frame .",
    "eric decides to talk through the solution to the problem with his group .",
    "his preference is to start in the conceptual math frame by comparing this problem to previous problems , and his initial conclusion is that the probability density is time independent .",
    "eric : :    i think  cause when you do the , um , absolute value , you have to    multiply by the complex conjugate , so i m pretty sure that e thing    [ complex exponential part of the wave function ] will just go to one ,    cause you ll replace that with  that e to the minus blah blah blah with    e to the plus blah blah blah , and then when you multiply the  1 over ,    you know , @xmath10 over @xmath10 . that s what i m    thinking",
    "we think eric is in the conceptual math frame because he uses reasoning based on the behavior of the exponential function and complex conjugate to determine the `` form '' of the answer ; namely , that the complex conjugate causes complex exponential terms to drop out when multiplied together .",
    "he is nt working on an algorithmic solution ; he s arguing from the nature of these functions that his solution is reasonable .",
    "after he outlines the reasoning behind his conclusion , he begins working this problem out to check his answer .",
    "after about two minutes the instructor mentions that the answer is time dependent , which confuses eric , who proclaims his violated expectation loudly .",
    "eric : :    it is time dependent ?",
    "( while the instructor is explaining , he    works on his paper ) there s cross terms !",
    "stupid  (smacks himself on    forehead ) ugh  that s why .",
    "ugh , so stupid .",
    "( from eric s tone of voice , we interpret that eric uses `` stupid '' to mean that his reasoning was thoughtless , not that he is personally stupid . )",
    "the instructor s answer violates eric s previous conclusion , prompting him to shift to another frame to explain the new answer .",
    "he realizes that his conceptual shortcut that exponentials will cancel with each other caused him to make a mistake . by viewing the problem algorithmically",
    ", eric is able to review his work and determine what went wrong .",
    "he tries to find an answer for his question by transitioning to the algorithmic math frame and noticing that the `` cross terms '' are non - zero in this case .",
    "the next example illustrates a transition from algorithmic physics to algorithmic math .",
    "both of these frames are narrow and actions in them are taken rapidly and frequently .",
    "in this session the instructor asks the students to find the wave function of the free particle by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "emma begins to write down time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "she tries to remember where to put @xmath25 in the time dependent side of the equation and asks eric if he remembers .",
    "eric then recalls and writes the tdse on the whiteboard .",
    "after they both finish writing the equations , emma compares them .",
    "emma : :    this is what i have , good we agree .",
    "( very quickly reviewing the facts )    f= 0 , v=0 ,  separable .",
    "emma is in an algorithmic physics frame , recalling equations and matching them term - by - term in preparation for solving the problem using a known procedure : separation of variables .",
    "however , eric is in a different frame .",
    "he bids to begin their problem solving by thinking about the physical system :    eric : :    so this is like the infinite [ square well ] , except for we do nt have    boundaries .",
    "eric s comment compares the current problem to a well - understood system and provides opportunities for further thinking about their current system . here",
    "eric is using reasoning about a physical system by analogy to a previous problem , which is indicative of conceptual physics thinking .",
    "however , emma does not take up eric s bid to use the conceptual physics frame .",
    "after eric s comment , emma asks adam to join their group .",
    "adam s involvement transitions the group into the aglorithmic math frame , picking up emma s earlier work on algorithmic physics to state known equations .",
    "adam begins by checking that the conditions for this problem satisfy the time independent schrdinger equation .",
    "he spends a short time in algorithmic math frame to justify that the energy in the spatial part of the schrdinger equation could be anything .",

    "emboldened , we extended our coding of student responses to difficulties not present in our qualitative data . inasmuch as possible , we investigated students statements ( or equations , on occasion ) to identify the nature of their reasoning .",
    "for example , a response which is just a piece of an equation suggests that the student used an algorithmic frame to generate their response , whereas a response which coordinates energy and probability descriptions comes from a conceptual physics frame .",
    "students reasoning comes as responses to specific questions , and those questions strongly influence their framing .",
    "we examined problem statements for what frame(s ) they promote initially .",
    "for example , consider these two problems :    * using the time - independent schrdinger equation , calculate the changes to @xmath28 , the ground state , as the given well shrinks from @xmath29 wide to @xmath30 wide .",
    "* what happens to the energy of the ground state when a finite square well gets narrower ?",
    "the first encourages students to think mathematically ( `` calculate '' ) and algorithmically ( by hinting at a procedure ) .",
    "the second is more conceptual , specifying neither numbers nor procedures .",
    "some problem statements , particularly multipart problems , require students to start in one frame and shift to another one ( for example , see section [ sec : ex1 ] ) . in those cases",
    ", we coded for which sequence(s ) of frames would yield correct answers .      through intensive discussion among multiple researchers , we coded for which frame(s ) a problem statement promoted , and which frame(s ) were evident in students reasoning .",
    "for some difficulties , students responses or the descriptions of students reasoning did not contain enough detail to figure out students framing .",
    "our goals in these discussions were to come to agreement about our inferences of student reasoning .",
    "as our discussion reached consensus and our codebook stabilized , two independent raters coded both the rating of the problem statements and the ratings of the students responses ( or the descriptions of students reasoning ) , with an agreement rate of @xmath0 for both kinds of coding .",
    "once problem statements were coded for frames promoted and student responses were coded for frames used , we classified students difficulties into three categories :    * transition error : when a problem statement requires a transition between frames , and students are unable to make that transition .",
    "* displacement error : when a problem statement promotes one frame , but students reasoning puts them in another frame . * content error : when students appear to be framing the problem correctly , but are not activating appropriate resources to solve it .",
    "many student responses to these questions are correct , and our analysis of student difficulties can not capture those responses .",
    "this is a fundamental limitation of difficulties - based research : it seeks to describe the ways students are wrong , not the ways that their responses are reasonable .    some difficulties could have arisen because of multiple types of error .",
    "this is a limitation of secondary analysis ",
    "we do nt have full reports of student reasoning  and of the survey - style free - response data on which many of the original difficulties are based .",
    "for this reason , we classified some difficulties as arising from multiple error types .",
    "with sufficiently detailed data , we believe that each difficulty - displaying student response can be classified into a single error type .",
    "additionally , some surveys were multiple choice .",
    "while the original researchers based the choices on common student reasoning , and that reasoning could have showed evidence of student framing , the multiple - choice answers themselves are often insufficiently detailed to determine students framing .",
    "inasmuch as possible , we coded researchers descriptions of student difficulties , but sometimes we simply did not have enough information .",
    "in this section , we show examples of each kind of error , arguing from our data and from published difficulties that difficulties can be categorized by framing error type . within each type , we tabulate published difficulties . because some problems require transitions between frames and some do not , we classify difficulties first by the kind of problem they come from and second by the kind of errors they produce .",

    "the probability density depends on time if the modulus square of the wave function depends on time .",
    "the wave functions are given at time @xmath31 .",
    "the authors mention that the problem requires students to think about the time dependent phase of each term in the superposition wave function .",
    "this encourages students to frame the question as thinking about what it means to be in a superposition of states , what are the energies of each term in the superposition , and how the system evolves over time .",
    "additionally , the problem statement includes multiple representations for students to conceptually coordinate .",
    "this way of framing the problem suggests conceptual physics as the initial frame .    the starting point for the students that may help them to think of the time evolution operator , which is determined by the hamiltonian of the system . after students recognized the correct time phase factors ,",
    "they need to coordinate frames toward mathematical representations to show how the phase factors determine the time dependence of the probability density .",
    "our framework has two possible transitions from conceptual physics into mathematics frames :    algorithmic math : :    in algorithmic math , a student would manipulate the modulus square of    the superposed wave function explicitly and algorithmically , finding    that the time dependence of the pure terms falls out , and the time    dependence of the cross terms persists . conceptual math",

    "we do not categorize this difficulty as a displacement error , since it is evident that the student is interacting with the problem statement to choose the initial energy of the system as being measurable during the perturbation . however , this is not enough evidence of student interaction with the problem statement to conclude that they are in the proper frame and the error is limited to content elements .",
    "for example , there is no evidence showing that the student is thinking about the influence of the new hamiltonian in framing the situation , while the perturbation is on during @xmath52 @xmath53 t @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "after the perturbation is removed all the energy eigenvalues of the original hamiltonian are measurable , including the energy of the initial state of the system prior to the perturbation .",
    "nearly 40% of the junior - level students have this correct notion ; however , about half of these students consider their answer to be valid under the condition that the wave function needs time to  feel the effects \" of the change in the hamiltonian of the system . the lack of enough information for this difficulty topic in the paper disabled us to determine students probable framing .",
    "the authors found evidence that students also have difficulty with recognizing the role of the hamiltonian in determining the time independence aspect of the probability density or the wave function in other problems and contexts .",
    "however , they did not provide evidence of the students descriptions .",
    "this described difficulty could be similar to the difficulty reported by emigh et al.@xcite when students confuse the time dependence of the potential of a perturbed system with the time dependence aspect of the probability density .",

    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows all the possible ways that descriptions of published difficulties can be mapped into errors in framing and resource use . each number in the figure [ fig:4 ] refers to the number of difficulties in that error category .",
    "this figure shows that all of the error categories and combination of them are populated with some difficulty topics .",
    "given our two axis framework we can predict the kinds of difficulties that will emerge for a given problem in quantum mechanics , which can provide a possible deeper structure to student s cognitive process .    ]",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] , and figure [ fig:6 ] give an overview of the occurrence of the three error types of displacement , transition , and content among all the topics .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows that displacement error is the most frequent among problem statements which require transition .",
    "this suggests that when students solve problems which require additional steps , they are more likely to begin from an inappropriate frame .",
    "in contrast for simpler questions that do not require transition , content errors are the most frequent . on these problems ,",
    "the problem statement is more likely to cue students into an appropriate frame , but students are less likely to finish successfully .",
    "a great deal of effort goes into designing and testing questions which will reveal or cause student difficulties , so it s possible that these error rates are an artifact of the kinds of questions most likely to produce difficulty - like responses .    ]    ]",
    "in this study through observing students epistemic activities we could identify the state of students thinking associated to four discrete frames including algorithmic math , conceptual math , conceptual physics and algorithmic physics .",
    "we presented several examples of students group problems solving switching frames to productively and correctly solve a problem .",
    "while the student from our study  eric \" ( section [ sec : eric ] ) switched from conceptual math to algorithmic math , we do not mean to imply that algorithmic math is universally more productive than conceptual math .",
    "rather , what counts as productive framing depends strongly on the problem context , and different frames may be productive at different times within a problem .",
    "students difficulties in quantum mechanics  such as thinking that the probability density is time independent for a superposition of two stationary states , as this student does  may simply be the result of unproductive framing and not fundamental inability to solve these problems .",
    "we reanalyzed the list of difficulties in quantum mechanics using our framework , seeking an underlying structure to the kinds of difficulties other researchers have identified .",
    "this framework splits the underlying thought process of student into three different categories as displacement error , transition error and content error .",
    "the displacement error reveals students unproductive frame of the situation .",
    "content error shows what pieces of knowledge have to be activated to understand all the ideas incorporated in the problem frame .",
    "the last error is transition , where students have ideas in different mental spaces but do not coordinate them .",
    "this framework reveals different levels of cognitive process of students thinking , which has instructional implications .",
    "instructors awareness of student s error categories may help them scaffold students reasoning better , as instructors can tip students into different frames@xcite or gently nudge students to use additional resources@xcite to resolve content errors .",
    "our analysis of secondary data is hampered by the very nature of that data : we do nt have access to full student reasoning because sometimes primary sources do nt report it , and sometimes the nature of their survey data precludes them from collecting it .",
    "we expect that , were sufficiently detailed data available , all of the student reasoning attributed to difficulties could be analyzed in this framework .",
