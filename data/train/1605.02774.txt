    "another important feature is the alternated action of two unitary operators , namely , the coin and shift operators .",
    "although all discrete - time qw models have the `` alternation between unitaries '' feature , the coin is not always necessary because the evolution operator can be defined in terms of the graph vertices only , without using an internal space as , for instance , in szegedy s model  @xcite or in the ones described in refs .",

    "@xcite , and the entire szegedy model  @xcite class .",
    "although covering a more general class of quantum walks , there is a restriction on the local evolution operations in the sqw demanding hermiticity besides unitarity .",
    "this severely compromises the possibilities for actual implementations of sqws on physical systems because the unitary evolution operators , given in terms of time - independent hamiltonians having the form @xmath1 , are non - hermitian in general . to have a model , that besides being powerful as the sqw , to be also fitted for practical physical implementations , it would be necessary to relax on the hermiticity requirement for the local unitary operators .    in this work",
    ", we propose an extension of the sqw model employing non - hermitian local operators .",
    "the concatenated evolution operator has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are unitary and hermitian , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are general angles representing specific systems energies and time intervals ( divided by the planck constant @xmath7 ) .",

    "those do not encompass all the possible coined qw models , as there are flip - flop coined qws , which although being built with non - hermitian unitary evolution , can not be put in the sqw model with hamiltonians .",

    "the simplest choice is the uniform superposition given by @xmath35 for @xmath33 .",
    "there is a recipe to build a unitary and hermitian operator associated with the tessellation , when we use the following structure : @xmath36 @xmath3 is unitary because the polygons are non - overlapping , that is , @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath3 is hermitian because it is a sum of hermitian operators .",
    "then , @xmath39 .",
    "an operator of this kind is called an _",
    "orthogonal reflection _ of graph @xmath24 .",
    "each @xmath29 induces a polygon and we say that @xmath3 induces the tessellation .",
    "the idea of the staggered model is to define a second operator that must be independent of @xmath3 .",

    "likewise , define @xmath48 @xmath4 is an orthogonal reflection .    to obtain the evolution operator we demand that the union of tessellations @xmath49 and @xmath50 should cover the edges of @xmath24 , where tessellation @xmath49 is the union of polygons @xmath29 for @xmath51 and tessellation @xmath50 is the union of polygons @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "this demand is necessary because edges that do not belong to the tessellation union can be removed from the graph without changing the dynamics .",

    "however , such graph - based construction of the operators does not correspond , in general , to the evolution of the real physical systems which are unitary but non - hermitian instead .",

    "( [ h_0 ] )  and  ( [ h_1 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we introduce and analyze a method for constructing `` physical evolutions '' using the graph - based unitary and hermitian operators .",

    "is characterized by two tessellations and the angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution operator is the product of two _ local _ unitary operators .",
    "local in the sense discussed before , that is , if a particle is on vertex @xmath0 , it will move to the neighborhood of @xmath0 only .",

    "if we wish to use the minimum number of tessellations that cover all vertices and edges , the only choice are the two tesselations represented in the figure and correspond to two alternate interactions between first neighbors .",
    "therefore the evolution operator in the one - dimensional case with @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the sake of simplicity , we choose @xmath49 and @xmath50 to be independent from @xmath62 .",

    ", one can not immediately see the connections to interactions energies that they usually represent . for actual implementations , it is more convenient to write down it in terms of bosonic operators as @xmath65 in that form the first term represents the occupations of each site and the second one represents hopping hamiltonians .",
    "note that since the qw models considered here are single particles quantum walks , the corresponding picture in terms of hamiltonians ( [ h00 ] ) and ( [ h11 ] ) implementation is to consider a single excitation in the encoding physical system .",

    "however the alternated action of the two local unitary operators in  ( [ unit ] ) requires that the hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath4 be applied independently .",
