    "<S> we draw connections to recent experiments and discuss how our results can be used in future experiments to accurately determine e.g. hybridization gaps in heavy fermion systems .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ landau quantization of electrons  @xcite , which leads to quantum oscillations ( qo ) of physical observables as a function of applied magnetic field  @xcite , has been one of the cornerstones of condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , it leads to new phenomena such as the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite and its fractional version  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter , it even induces an unexpected new phase of matter beyond the standard landau classification  @xcite , which ignited the field of topological phases  @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it is itself an invaluable tool for the characterization of correlated metallic systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical lk  @xcite theory of qo in metals showed that the periodicity , e.g. of the magnetization , is proportional to extremal cross sectional areas of the fs , thus turning qo into a precise quantitative and by now standard tool for determining fss . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , lifshitz and kosevich showed that it is possible to study correlation effects by extracting the effective mass , @xmath0 , from the temperature dependence of the qo amplitudes given by ( for the first harmonic ) @xmath1 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> later the lk theory was extended to include more general self energy interaction effects  @xcite , but these always preserved the general structure of the lk theory only renormalizing parameters , e.g. @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it still comes as a great surprise that experimentally almost all materials , from weakly interacting metals to strongly correlated heavy fermion systems  @xcite or copper oxide high temperature superconductors  @xcite , are consistent with a lk description which is manifestly an effective single particle theory . </S>",
    "<S> there have been only very few exceptions for heavy fermion systems , e.g. cecoin@xmath3  @xcite and most recently the tentative topological kondo insulator smb@xmath4  @xcite , violating the general temperature behaviour , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lknormal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there have been recent theoretical studies on qo which explored novel effects due to symmetry breaking from commensurate  @xcite or incommensurate  @xcite charge density waves but they remained in the canonical lk framework . </S>",
    "<S> a notable exception is given by ref . which derived a generalized formula for exotic quantum critical systems described via non - perturbative field theories .    </S>",
    "<S> historically , the firmly established understanding of qo is tied to the existence of a fs , which in principle impedes the following simple question : can there be qo in an insulator ? in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that , surprisingly , the general answer is _ yes_. </S>",
    "<S> this arises if the cyclotron frequency @xmath5 is of the order of the electronic gap and the band structure picks out a particular area of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , as described below . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that , even in this non - interacting setting , the electrons exhibit anomalous non - lk qos .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that a simple band insulator of itinerant electrons hybridized with a localized flat band does exhibit well - defined qo . </S>",
    "<S> the periodicity is given by the area defined by the intersection of the unhybridized bands even if the chemical potential , @xmath6 , is inside the hybridization gap or inside the flat part of the fs . </S>",
    "<S> in the latter case , the periodicity is equally unusual because it is not proportional to the fs area . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitudes strongly differs from the standard lk theory : first , if @xmath6 is inside the gap qo amplitudes have a maximum at a temperature set by the hybridization gap , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> second , for a chemical potential inside the bands but close to the flat regions the behaviour is even more complex and governed by an additional energy scale , @xmath8 , which is the distance of @xmath6 above the bottom of the upper band . for @xmath9 there is a characteristic steep increase of the amplitudes towards lowest temperatures .    </S>",

    "<S> we find that even if @xmath6 is inside the gap ( blue dashed ) or in the flat band region ( red ) there are well defined qo which are directly proportional to the area picked out by the intersection of the unhybridized bands ( here directly proportional to @xmath19 ) . </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion and conclusion . </S>",

    "<S> we believe that our results are most promisingly applicable to certain heavy fermion materials whose properties well below the kondo temperature are effectively described by a band structure similar to our model  @xcite . in that context </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out that our theory has its most prominent deviations from the lk description in a regime in which the cyclotron frequency , @xmath5 , is larger than the hybridization strength @xmath7 as well as the activation gap @xmath96  a condition fulfilled at least by some heavy fermion materials .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the main features of our peculiar temperature dependence were already observed in heavy fermion compounds in two of the rarely available experimental examples deviating from lk theory : amplitudes of some frequencies of the dhvae in cecoin@xmath3 display a clear maximum at a nonzero temperature of 100 mk , which has been attributed to a fine tuned spin - dependent mass enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> most recently , the tentative topological kondo insulator smb@xmath4  @xcite , for which the appearance of qo itself despite the opening of an activation gap  @xcite ( as seen in transport ) has been a puzzle , does show qo with a very strong increase of intensity below 1k signaling the presence of a second low energy scale in the system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although , the latter is likely an interaction effect it is interesting to note that in our non - interacting theory a chemical potential not in the gap but just touching one of the heavy bands ( @xmath97 )  @xcite sets a new energy scale and gives a very similar temperature dependence with a steep increase of the amplitudes at very low temperatures , see fig .  [ fig2 ] . for the actual material smb@xmath4 it is more likely that our scenario just explains why there are qo in this kondo insulating system at all but the incorporation of self energy effects into our theory , which will introduce a second energy scale from coupling to collective modes , is a promising route for future investigations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is an open question for future research , whether certain semiconductors with small direct band gaps could also display similar anomalous dhvaes .    despite many decades of intense research on the dhvae we have demonstrated that it still holds surprises </S>",
    "<S>  there can be be qo even in insulating systems . beyond a mere curiosity the interest in standard lk - like qo derives from its capacity of accurately determining fss . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we anticipate that our _ anomalous dhvae _ </S>",
    "<S> applicable to heavy fermi liquids will be useful in the future for determining hybridization gaps ( proportional to the kondo coupling ) by measuring the temperature of maximum amplitudes .    _ acknowledgments . _ </S>",
