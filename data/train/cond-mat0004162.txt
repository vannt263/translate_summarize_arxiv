    "the nature of the insulating ground state of interacting electron systems has been a subject of long - standing interest and debate in condensed matter physics . because of strong quantum effects caused by spatial confinement and technical advantages for theoretical treatment ,",

    "are rarely decoupled . despite these findings ,",
    "there remain important unresolved issues regarding the quantum nature of the insulating state in 1d interacting electron systems and the phase transitions driven by the electron correlation .",
    "the first issue concerns the establishment of an accurate phase diagram and the critical behavior near the phase boundaries .",
    "secondly , a band insulator ( bi ) with quasi - particle excitations typically can not be characterized by charge and spin excitations .",
    "a proper characterization scheme needs to be developed .",
    "most importantly , the nature of the correlation - driven transition from bi to mott insulator ( mi ) is still not fully understood .",
    "there has been considerable recent interest in the study of a prototype one - dimensional model for ferroelectric perovskites for the understanding of the response of strongly correlated electron systems with lattice distortions .",
    "these efforts have raised and addressed some fundamental issues in the nature of the quantum phase transition and the related critical behavior in 1d interacting electron systems .",
    "earlier works @xcite mainly deal with the effects of strong electron correlation on the electron - lattice interaction and the polarization effects in the insulator .",
    "quantum phase transitions and the characterization of the insulating state are the focus of more recent work.@xcite in particular , an issue of fascinating debate is the nature of the transition ( or crossover ) from the bi phase to the mi phases",
    ". gidopoulos _",
    "et al . _ showed @xcite that due to the reversal of inversion symmetry of the ground state from bi to mi , there is a critical point for spin excitations .",

    "recently , fabrizio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed an effective field theory for this problem and showed that there are two continuous transitions from bi to mi .",
    "one is a spin transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type at a critical point @xmath9 , and the other is an exciton transition at an ising critical point @xmath10 where the exciton gap closes . between @xmath6 and @xmath11 , the site - parity is spontaneously broken and the system is characterized by a doubly degenerate , dimerized ground state .",
    "these results raise interesting questions about the structure of the ground - state phase diagram of 1d interacting electron systems and the characterization of the critical behavior near the transition points from the bi phase to the mi phase .",

    "we find that a charge - neutral spin - singlet exciton band forms in the bi phase and drops below the band gap as @xmath0 increases beyond a special point @xmath5 . with increasing @xmath0",
    "the excitons then condense and the system enters a dimerized phase , followed by the closure of the quasi - particle ( both spin and charge ) gap when the system enters the mi phase .",

    "et al._@xcite on the existence of two critical points for the transition from bi to mi . we also present detailed results on the formation of the exciton band and the scaling behavior near the critical points .",
    "in addition , we carry out tmrg calculations to study thermodynamic properties to further elucidate the gap and critical behavior of the system .",
    "to properly characterize the bi and mi phases and establish the phase diagram , we need to evaluate the behavior of several low - energy excitations , including the charge and spin excitations and an exciton excitation that will be used to characterize the bi phase .",

    ", the mi phase is reached when @xmath0 is large ( including the limit @xmath30 ) . in the mi phase , it is well understood that the charge gap is non - zero , but the spin gap is zero . therefore @xmath26 is the charge excitation gap .",

    "the calculations show that @xmath46 is always observed , indicating that there is no triplet exciton formation in the bi phase .",
