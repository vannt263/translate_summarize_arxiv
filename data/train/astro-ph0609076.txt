    "the tully  fisher relation ( tfr ; tully @xmath2 fisher 1977 ) is one of the most important physically - motivated correlations found in spiral galaxies . the correspondence between luminosity and maximum rotational velocity ( @xmath3 ) is usually interpreted as a product of the close relation between the stellar and total masses of galaxies or , in other words , as the presence of a relatively constant mass - to - light ratio in the local spiral galaxy population ( e.g. gavazzi 1993 , zwaan et al .",
    "such a general property in spirals puts strong constraints on galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g. mao et al . 1998 , van den bosch , 2000 ) and cosmological models ( e.g. giovanelli et al .",
    "1997 , sakai et al .",
    "also , the low scatter in the tfr ( only @xmath4 mag in @xmath5-band , according to giovanelli et al .",
    "1997 , sakai et al .",
    "2000 , tully & pierce 2000 and verheijen 2001 ) permits us to use this tool as a good distance estimator ( e.g. yasuda et al . 1997 ) .",
    "attempts to ascertain whether s0 galaxies follow a similar tfr have two main motivations .",
    "first , if there is a tfr of s0s , it would prove useful for estimating distances in the nearby universe , particularly in clusters where s0s are very prevalent ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "second , and more related to the present study , a possible scenario where s0 galaxies are the descendants of evolved spirals at higher redshifts ( dressler 1980 , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) could leave traces of this evolution in the observed tfr of s0s .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed as the channels for such evolution , like small mergers ( schweizer 1986 ) , gas stripping in later types ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , halo stripping ( bekki et al . 2002 ) and galaxy harassment ( moore et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if this kind of picture is correct , it would be expected that s0s retain some memory of their past as spirals , in particular through their tfr , and perhaps even some clues as to which of the channels they evolved down .",
    "only a few studies of the tfr for s0 galaxies can be found in the literature .",
    "the first effort , made by dressler & sandage ( 1983 ) , found no evidence for the existence of a tfr for s0 galaxies .",
    "however , the limited spatial extent of their rotation curves , the inhomogeneous photographic photometry employed and the large uncertainties in the distances to their sample made it almost certain that any correlation between luminosity and rotational velocity would be lost in the observational uncertainties .",
    "fifteen years later , neistein et al . ( 1999 ) explored the existence of a tfr for s0s in the @xmath5-band , using a sample of 18 local s0s from the field .",
    "although some evidence for a tfr was uncovered in this study , they also found a large scatter of @xmath6 magnitudes in the relation , suggesting the presence of more heterogeneous evolutionary histories for these galaxies when compared to spirals .",
    "also , a systematic shift @xmath7 magnitudes was found between their galaxies and the relation for local spirals .    in two papers , hinz et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) , explored the @xmath5- and @xmath8-band tfrs for 22 s0s in the coma cluster and 8 s0s in the virgo cluster . by using cluster data",
    ", they avoided some of the errors that arise from the uncertainty in absolute distances estimation .",
    "the analysis of @xmath5-band data from the coma cluster revealed very similar results to the study by neistein et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , implying that the larger scatter of the latter could not be attributed to distance errors or the heterogeneous nature of the data . in the @xmath8-band ,",
    "an even larger scatter of 1.3 magnitudes was found , but with a smaller offset from the corresponding spiral galaxy tfr of only 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "interestingly , there was no evidence for any systematic difference between the results for the virgo and coma clusters , despite their differences in richness and populations , implying that these factors could not be responsible for the scatter in the tfr . given the large scatter and small shift in the @xmath8-band tfr for s0s compared to spirals , it was concluded that these galaxies properties are not consistent with what would be expected for spiral galaxies whose star formation had been truncated ; instead they suggested that other mechanisms such as minor mergers are responsible for the s0s tfr .",
    "by contrast , mathieu , merrifield & kuijken ( 2002 ) found in their detailed dynamical modeling of six disk - dominated field s0s that these galaxies obey a tight @xmath5-band tfr with a scatter of only 0.3 magnitudes , but offset from the spiral galaxy tfr by a massive 1.8 magnitudes .",
    "the authors therefore concluded that these objects were consistent with being generated by passively fading spirals that had simply stopped producing stars .",
    "this result does not appear to be consistent with the previous studies , although it should be borne in mind that the galaxies in this study were selected to be disk - dominated , so they morphologically resemble spiral galaxies more than those in other work .",
    "in addition , their field locations means that they are less likely to have had their evolution complicated by mergers .",
    "it is therefore possible that these s0s really are just passively - fading spirals where those in clusters have led more complicated lives .",
    "as can be seen , there is no general consensus as to either the scatter or the shift in the tfr for s0 galaxies when compared to spirals , and so no agreement as to their interpretation .",
    "we therefore revisit the tfr of s0 galaxies in this paper , adding our new spectral dataset from the fornax cluster to the existing results from literature .",
    "in addition to the new homogeneous spectral data set , we can also take advantage of the 2mass photometry for these galaxies ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) , to obtain consistent infrared magnitudes and structural parameters for all the galaxies .",
    "with this more systematic study of s0s , it is to be hoped that we can avoid any past problems that may have arisen due to the heterogeneous nature of the available data , to reveal the underlying physics that dictates the tfr in s0 galaxies .",
    "the remainder of the paper is laid out as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we describe the different samples of s0s used in this study , and the data that we have adopted . section  [ sec : results ] presents the main results and then discusses their implications . finally in section  [ sec : conc ] our conclusions are summarised .",
    "to build the tfr of local s0 galaxies , we have collated the data on their kinematics from four previous studies .",

    "this combined data set provides us with 60 s0 galaxies with measured kinematics , the largest sample yet used in a study of the s0 tfr .",
    "the collated kinematic data values for the maximum rotation speed , @xmath3 ( for all the sample ) , and the central velocity dispersion , @xmath9 ( for 51 galaxies of the sample ) , are listed in table  a1 .      in the present study",
    ", we have adopted @xmath1-band photometry from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , jarrett et al .",

    "photometry in @xmath1-band is available for all objects , while 54 galaxies have photometry in @xmath0-band .    in order to convert these data to absolute magnitudes , we need distances to all objects in the sample . in the clusters , we adopted distance moduli of 31.35 for members of the fornax cluster ( madore et al .",

    "( 2001 ) were used . finally , for the m02 sample",
    ", redshifts from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database were used where available . for two of their galaxies ( ngc1611 and ngc2612 ) , an estimate of the distance was calculated by the authors , using the systemic velocity derived from their spectra .",
    "a hubble constant of @xmath10km@xmath11s@xmath12mpc@xmath13 was adopted in converting redshifts into distances .",
    "galactic extinction corrections were calculated using the schlegel , finkeiner & davis ( 1998 ) reddening curve description , @xmath14 , where @xmath15=4.32 and 0.37 for @xmath16 and @xmath1 , respectively . in the @xmath0-band",
    ", we applied the @xmath17-correction from poggianti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; no correction was applied for the @xmath1-band , as it is negligible .",
    "no internal extinction correction was applied to the apparent magnitudes ; there is no definitive study on the internal extinction of s0 galaxies , but the apparent lack of dust in these systems suggests that such a correction would be very small .",
    "the resulting absolute magnitudes in @xmath1 and @xmath0-bands are listed in tables  a1 and a2 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the absolute magnitudes , we derived structural parameters from the spatially - extended photometry available for these galaxies .",
    "the data used were the publicly - available `` postage stamp '' images in the @xmath1-band from 2mass .",
    "bulge - plus - disk models were fitted directly to these images using gim2d ( simard et al .",
    "2002 ) , with a srsic law adopted for the bulge distribution , and an exponential for the disk . in this way , we derived values for the bulge effective radius , @xmath18 , its srsic index , @xmath19 , the disk scalelength , @xmath20 , the half - light radius , @xmath21 , the bulge - to - total fraction , @xmath22 , and the galaxy inclination @xmath23 . in a few cases ,",
    "the derived bulge scale length was found to be smaller than the seeing ( @xmath24 arcsec ) . in those cases ,",
    "the structural parameters are not well constrained by the observations , so the values were excluded .",
    "the structural parameters derived for the remaining 48 galaxies are listed in table  a1 .",
    "we have full spectral data for 7 fornax cluster galaxies from which we can extract lick indices .",
    "a detailed description of the line indices calculation is given in our forthcoming study of the stellar populations of these galaxies ( bedregal et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "briefly , we convolved the spectral bins with appropriate gaussians ( including galactic and instrumental dispersions ) in order to achieve the @xmath25 resolution of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ( hereafter bc03 ) simple stellar populations models .",
    "the indices @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 were measured within @xmath18/8 ( `` central '' values ) , between 0.75 and 1.25 @xmath18 ( `` @xmath30 '' values ) and between 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath18 ( `` @xmath31 '' values).the resulting values are presented in tables  a2 and a3 .",

    "2002 , denicolo et al .",
    "2004 ) mainly corresponding to field s0s from the n99 subsample .",
    "unfortunately , these datasets mainly include the brightest objects of the sample , so it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons with the fainter galaxies from fornax .",
    "also , differences between the two samples could arise because of the superior quality of fornax data , effect which is difficult to quantify . in consequence",
    ", we will focus our analysis of the line indices , ages and metallicities on the data from the fornax cluster only .    from fornax galaxies indices , one can derive measures of the luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities . to this end",
    ", we have used the simple single - age stellar population models of bc03 to translate the measured line indices into estimates of age and metallicity . as a check on the uncertainties inherent in this process ,",
    "we have repeated the calculations using the @xmath27 index and the combined indices @xmath32 ( gorgas , efstathiou & aragn - salamanca 1990 ) and @xmath33'$ ] ( gonzlez 1993 ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ) as the metallicity - sensitive index .",
    "solar abundance ratios were assumed for the models .",
    "the resulting ages , metallicities and their uncertainties ( which include the effects of covariance between the two parameters ) are also shown in tables  a2 and a3 .",
    "the basic result of this analysis is presented in the tully  fisher plots of rotation velocity versus absolute magnitude shown in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] ( for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band respectively ) . in these plots ,",

    "it is also interesting to note that this result holds true for the s0 data from all environments , from the poorest field objects to fairly rich clusters , so it is clearly a very general phenomenon .",
    "we therefore now seek to quantify and model the possible origins of such an offset .",
    "one problem in trying to quantify the offset in the tfr is that the incompleteness in magnitude of the data presented in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] will bias a conventional fit .",
    "we therefore adopt the approach of willick ( 1994 ) , which involves fitting the inverse function , @xmath36 to minimise this source of bias . the slope @xmath37 is fixed to match the slope for the spiral galaxy tfr , and @xmath38 is varied to find the least - squares fit between this function and the data , with each point @xmath23 weighted by @xmath39 where @xmath40 to account for the uncertainty in the measured maximum velocity , @xmath41 , and that in the absolute magnitude , @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is set to quantify the intrinsic scatter in the relation such that the reduced @xmath44 of the fit comes out at unity ; this procedure is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : scatter ] .",
    "setting @xmath37 equal to the inverse of the spiral tfr slope determined by tp00 , we can determine the zero - point parameter @xmath38 and hence the offset in magnitudes from the tp00 tfr relations in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band .",
    "the resulting best - fit lines are shown dotted in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] .",
    "the offsets from the tp00 relations are @xmath45 and @xmath46 where the quoted error includes the uncertainty in zero point of both the s0 and spiral tfrs . to test the robustness of this result against the uncertainty in the spiral tfr",
    ", we repeated the analysis using the sak00 @xmath0-band relation to fix the slope and measured the offset from their relation .",
    "this analysis resulted in an offset of @xmath47 within the errors of the previous analysis but somewhat smaller .",
    "sak00 did not publish a @xmath1-band tfr , but the parallel nature of the sak00 and tp00 tfrs in figure  [ fig : tfrb ] suggest that most of the difference arose from a zero - point shift due to a different distance - scale calibration .",
    "we might therefore extrapolate from the sak00 @xmath0-band results on the assumption that @xmath48 , to infer a corresponding @xmath1-band offset of @xmath49    these new estimates for the offset between spiral and s0 tfrs tend to lie toward the upper end of earlier estimates , mainly because of the more recent refinements in the calibration to the spiral galaxy tfr that we have included in this analysis .",
    "however , even neglecting these systematic changes , the values obtained here lie within the range of offsets in the tfr suggested by previous studies , implying that this quantity can be fairly reliably determined , particularly with the larger and more homogeneous data set presented here .",
    "the most natural interpretation of the offset between the s0 and spiral tfrs is that it represents a simple fading as a spiral galaxy s star formation is truncated when it mutates into an s0 .",
    "one complication in attempting to quantify this scenario is that one needs to know what luminosity the spiral galaxy started at in this evolution .",
    "however , observations out to redshifts beyond unity seem to show that there has been essentially no evolution in either the slope or zero - point of the spiral galaxy tfr in optical or infrared wavebands over this period ( vogt et al .",
    "1997 , conselice et al .",
    "2005 , bamford et al . 2006",
    "; although see rix et al .",
    "1997 and bhm et al .",
    "2004 for alternative views ) .",
    "this lack of evolution means that the starting point for fading spirals is the same spiral galaxy tfr that we see today , and the offset between the nearby galaxy spiral and s0 tfrs does provide an accurate measure of the degree to which the s0 galaxies must have faded if this picture is correct .    to see",
    "if this scenario is plausible and to quantify the timescales involved , we have used the bc03 synthesis models to calculate the fading of a stellar population that started with a constant star formation rate of @xmath50yr@xmath13 for 5 gyrs , then stopped .",
    "the stellar population was assumed to have solar metallicity and the initial mass function of chabrier ( 2003 ) . by matching the decrease in luminosity to the observed shifts between spiral and s0 tfrs",
    ", we can determine how long ago the truncation in star formation must have occurred to be consistent with our observations .",
    "using the tp00 offsets in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-bands given in equations  [ eq : tpoffb ] and [ eq : tpoffks ] , we thus obtain times since truncation of @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . these values are somewhat inconsistent with each other , but this may just reflect the calibration of the spiral tfr in tp00 ; if we instead use the values that we infer from the sak00 calibration ( equations  [ eq : sakoffb ] and [ eq : sakoffks ] ) , we obtain more consistent timescales since truncation of @xmath53 and @xmath54 the shorter timescale simply reflects the smaller offset in the tfr that the sak00 calibration implies . however , this timescale is if anything worryingly short : it would be quite a coincidence if we are living at an epoch so close to the point at which all these galaxies transformed from spirals into s0s .",
    "one possible resolution is that the star formation history in transforming a spiral into an s0 might be somewhat more complex .",
    "indeed , poggianti et al . ( 1999 ) have suggested that cluster galaxies with k+a / a+k spectra observed at intermediate redshifts are the best candidates for s0 progenitors because of their spectro - photometric characteristics and the predominance of disk - dominated morphologies . since such spectra",
    "are usually identified with post - starburst galaxies , it would seem that spiral galaxies may undergo a `` last gasp '' burst of star formation when they start their transitions into s0s .",
    "to investigate this possibility , we added a burst of star formation , amounting to 10% of the total stellar mass , to the above truncated star formation model . repeating the comparison between the luminosity of this model as predicted by the bc03 population synthesis code and the observed offsets in the tfr resulted in estimates for the time since the burst and truncation of @xmath55 @xmath56 using the tp00 calibration , and @xmath57 @xmath58 using the sak00 values .",
    "as might be expected , the inclusion of a starburst increases the age of the stellar population compared to those found in the truncation model .",
    "these values are therefore a little more comfortable in terms of the timescales involved , and , at least using the sak00 calibration , produce fairly consistent results between different wavebands .",
    "however , there is a limit to how far it is worth pursuing these simple models , as it is extremely unlikely that all s0 galaxies will have undergone the same star formation history .",
    "indeed , the large scatter apparent in the points in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] indicates a relatively heterogeneous history for these systems : the average evolution may be as described above , but each galaxy has its own story to tell .",
    "we therefore now look in more detail at the scatter in the s0 tfr , in an attempt to quantify it and explore its origins .",
    "as outlined in the previous section , we estimate the intrinsic scatter in the tfr , @xmath43 , during the fitting process by varying its value in the weights of equation  [ eq : wi ] until the reduced @xmath44 of the fit , @xmath59 was equal to unity .",
    "the inverse slope of the tfr , @xmath37 , was set to the value appropriate to either the tp00 or the sak00 spiral tfr ( the values are so similar that it made no substantial difference to the measured scatter ) , while the zero - point @xmath38 was allowed to vary .",
    "the presence of variables in both numerator and denominator of equation [ eq : chi2r ] mean that the fit is no longer linear , but we found that it could be robustly performed by a simple iterative procedure in which at the @xmath60th iteration the estimate for @xmath43 was updated such that @xmath61 by setting the convergence parameter @xmath62 to @xmath63 , we found that the iterative solution was well behaved and converged in no more than 15 iterations . for comparison , we also calculated a weighted total scatter using the formula @xmath64    for the @xmath0-band tfr of s0s ( using tp00 slope ) , we thus derived @xmath65 while for @xmath1-band data ( using tp00 slope ) we found @xmath66 these values imply that @xmath67 90@xmath68 of the observed scatter in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] can not be explained by the known observational uncertainties in @xmath69 and log(@xmath70 ) .",
    "these results seem to be bracketed by previous estimates : h03 report a scatter in the @xmath8-band tfr of 1.18 magnitudes in the coma cluster and 1.33 in the virgo cluster , whereas previous @xmath5-band estimates of scatter have been lower at 0.68 magnitudes ( n99 ) and 0.82 magnitudes ( h03 ) .",
    "however , these previous studies are not directly comparable to the current estimates , because of their different wavebands and because they did not use the more robust inverse - fitting approach adopted here .",
    "in addition , it is not entirely clear whether the previous estimates have been corrected for measurement error , particularly in the uncertain measurement of @xmath71 .",
    "perhaps the simplest possible explanation for the large value @xmath43 is that the errors in the observed quantities plotted in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] have been underestimated , and have been erroneously attributed to the intrinsic scatter .",
    "we therefore begin by considering possible additional sources of uncertainty in the data .",
    "the adopted fluxes for the sample galaxies , particularly the infrared 2mass data , form a uniformly - measured reliable set , so it is unlikely that much of the scatter in the tfr could arise from errors in these data . however , their transformation into absolute magnitudes could introduce some uncertainty .",
    "for example , we have not applied any correction to the magnitudes due to the internal extinction of these systems .",
    "although such corrections are believed to be small in the relatively dust - free environment of an s0 , they might still be non - negligible .",
    "however , if such an effect were distorting the results , we would expect it to have a much stronger effect in the @xmath0-band than in the @xmath1-band ; the very similar values for @xmath43 derived in both bands imply that extinction is not a significant issue .",
    "similarly , it is possible that unaccounted errors in the adopted distances to the sample galaxies could contribute to the scatter in absolute magnitudes .",
    "however , although such an error could offset all the points derived from s0s in a single cluster , it would not increase their scatter .",
    "the lack of offsets between the virgo , coma and fornax cluster data and their similar large scatters in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] imply that such errors are not significant .",
    "the measurement of @xmath71 is more challenging .",
    "the measured doppler shift in the stellar component is only indirectly related to this quantity .",
    "first , since we only measure the line - of - sight component of velocity , a correction must be applied for inclination .",
    "however , it is in the nature of identifying s0 galaxies that only those relatively close to edge - on are classified as such ( jorgensen & franx 1994 ) : as table  a1 confirms , the vast majority of galaxies in the sample are at inclinations close to 90 degrees , so the corrections are relatively small .",
    "second , the stars in s0s do not follow perfectly circular orbits , so the measured rotation velocity will differ from the circular speed by a quantity termed the `` asymmetric drift '' ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for the virgo , coma and fornax cluster data , we have adopted the approach of n99 that uses the measured random velocities to correct for the asymmetric drift ; although this relatively simple correction may contain systematic uncertainties , it is unlikely to increase the scatter significantly",
    ". it is also notable that the new fornax cluster kinematic data used here reach to larger radii than the earlier samples .",
    "since the size of the asymmetric drift correction decreases with radius , we would expect any scatter induced by it to be smaller for these larger - radii data , but no differences are discernible .",
    "finally , we note that m02 used a more sophisticated dynamical modeling technique that removed the need for any asymmetric drift correction .",
    "although they claimed a resulting decrease in the scatter in the tfr , the better photometry presented in this paper suggests that this is only marginally the case .",
    "irrespective of the way that @xmath71 is derived , there seems to be a sizeable residual scatter in the tfr .",
    "we therefore now consider possible astrophysical origins for the scatter in the tfr . in this context , it is notable that the scatter that we derive , although much larger than that seen in the tfr of nearby spirals ( @xmath72 magnitudes ; tp00 , sak00 , verheijen 2001 ) , is similar to the scatter observed in the tfr of galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "bamford et al . ( 2006 ) obtained similar values for @xmath43 for their sample of high - redshift spirals in the @xmath0-band , while conselice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a similar scatter in their @xmath73-band tfr of spirals at redshifts between 0.2 and 1.2 .",
    "this larger scatter in the spiral tfr at higher redshift has been attributed to variations in the star formation rate in these systems due to more frequent interactions with other galaxies , gas clouds and cluster environment , as well as the less relaxed dynamical state of these systems ( e.g. shi et al .",
    "2006 , flores el at .",
    "it is therefore possible that the scatter in the s0 tfr was in some sense imprinted into these systems while they were still `` normal '' spiral galaxies at higher redshift , and that scatter has remained frozen into their tfr as they have evolved more gently to the present day .",
    "alternatively , the scatter could be a signature of the transformation process itself .",
    "for example , if the transition from spiral to s0 began over a range of times , then different galaxies will have faded by different amounts , leading to the observed scatter in the relation . as we have seen in section  [ sec : offset ] , the mean tfr will shift downward by more than a magnitude on billion - year timescales , so a spread in start times could explain the ultimate scatter . as a further complication , subsequent minor mergers might induce extra late bursts of star formation , or they could kill off the galaxy s star formation a little sooner , further scattering the relation . in order to try to distinguish between these possibilities , we now investigate whether the offset of individual s0s from the spiral galaxy tfr correlates with any of their other astrophysical properties .",

    "however , similar results are found if the analysis is performed using the optical @xmath0-band data . ] in particular , residual bias in the fitting of the tfr to figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] could induce a correlation between @xmath75 and the absolute magnitude of the galaxies , @xmath76 . since it is well know that other properties such as galaxies sizes correlate with their magnitudes , then such a bias in the tfr fit",
    "would also induce correlations with @xmath75 . in practice",
    ", figure  [ fig : mk_v_dmk ] shows that there is only the slightest hint of an anti - correlation between the derived values @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so this potential source of bias has clearly been dealt with reasonably effectively .     and @xmath74 versus half - light radius .",

    "the symbols used in these figures are the same as in figures  [ fig : tfrb ] and [ fig : tfrks ] .",
    "some of the resulting correlations are fairly trivial .",
    "for example , the absolute magnitude correlates quite well with the size of the galaxy , as characterised by its half - light radius ( see figure  [ fig : v_rhalf ] ) .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that this correlation is mainly driven by the size of the disks in these systems ( see figure  [ fig : v_rdisk ] ) , and is almost uncorrelated with the photometric properties of the bulge ( see figures  [ fig : v_reff ] and [ fig : v_sersic ] ) . similarly , as figure  [ fig : v_bovert ] shows , the magnitudes do not seem to be systematically affected by how much of the total luminosity is in the bulge or disk components .",
    "however , we also notice that cluster galaxies are mainly responsible of the scatter in figures  [ fig : v_rhalf ] and [ fig : v_reff ] , while field s0s tend to follow tighter trends in both diagram .",
    "however , such a difference between cluster and field galaxies could be related to different selection criteria , so any further interpretation would be excessive .     and @xmath74 versus central velocity dispersion . ]",
    "the lack of correlation with bulge photometric properties make it intriguing that the absolute magnitude does correlate with the central velocity dispersion , which is primarily a property of the galaxy s bulge ( see figure  [ fig : v_sig ] ) .",
    "presumably , this correlation is a manifestation of the well - known conspiracy by which rotation curves remain fairly flat across regions dominated by bulge , disk or halo : this conspiracy means that the bulge dispersion will be tightly related to the rotation speed in the disk , and , as we have seen above , disk properties do correlate with total luminosity .    in our attempt to understand the origins of the offset from the spiral galaxy tfr ,",
    "it is the correlation of parameters with this offset , @xmath75 , that is of more immediate interest . for most plots",
    ", however , there are no significant correlations to be seen ; where there is some hint of a correlation , it goes in the opposite sense to that seen with @xmath76 , suggesting that it may well be the kind of artifact discussed at the beginning of this section .     versus @xmath26 , @xmath77 , @xmath33'$ ] and",
    "@xmath27 central line indices for our fornax data .",
    "the error bar in the lower left corner of each panel shows the median error .",
    "dots with arrows indicate upper limits in @xmath78 . ]      a further hint as to the origins of the scatter in the tfr can be found by considering line index measurements and the infered luminosity - weighted ages from stellar populations synthesis models . for the reasons outlined in section  [ sec : data ] , from this point we focus our analysis on our fornax sample only .",
    "giving the homogeneity of the fornax dataset , we feel confident to use the offset from the @xmath0-band tfr , @xmath78 , for the rest of the analysis . despite the fact that uncertainties in rc3 @xmath0-band photometry are larger than in the 2mass @xmath1-band counterpart ,",
    "the total errors in @xmath79 are dominated by the uncertainties of the tfr from spirals . also , the @xmath0-band data is more sensitive to recent changes in the star formation history than the infrared band , being more suitable for this kind of study .",
    "in fact , similar results are found if the analysis is performed using @xmath1-band data .",
    "figure  [ fig : v_index ] shows @xmath80 plotted against different central indices ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and the combined indices @xmath32 and @xmath33'$ ] .",
    "the only indication of a trend with the offset from the tfr comes from the @xmath26 index , where @xmath78 seems to get weaker as @xmath26 increases , and stronger as @xmath26 decreases .",
    "this correlation is interesting since it is in the sense expected if the degree of fading of s0s is driven by the timescale since the last significant star formation .",
    "this possibility can be examined more quantitatively if we use the age we derived from these spectral indices in section  [ sec : data ] . to ascertain whether the resulting ages have being significantly influenced by enhancement of @xmath62-elements via the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy",
    ", we consider the estimates derived using @xmath27 , @xmath32 and @xmath33'$ ] parameters as the metallicity - sensitive index ; the results are shown in figure  [ fig : mb_age ] .",
    "the first column of this figure confirms the trend indicated by the central line indices alone : the fading of the fornax cluster s0s seems to be accompanied by an ageing of their stellar population .",
    "suggestively , the size of the effect is also of the amplitude expected for a passively fading stellar population : as we saw in section  [ sec : shiftint ] , over @xmath81 , we would expect a stellar population to fade by @xmath82 magnitudes in the @xmath0-band , just as seen with these data .",
    "the predictions from these models are overplotted in all the pertinent panels of figure  [ fig : mb_age ] .",
    "the second and third columns of this figure present similar data at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the correlations are stronger for central values than at larger galactocentric distances : a spearman ranking correlation coefficient test shows that the correlation between central age and @xmath78 is significant at between the 90% to 97.5% level , while at larger radii the confidence level decreases to a range between 85% to 90% level only .",
    "apart from the obvious increment in age uncertainties with s / n ratio ( so with radius ) , there is another plausible explanation for the apparent radial dependence of the relation .",
    "if high redshift spirals simply swith - off their star formation in order to become local s0s , the age versus @xmath78 relation would be sensitive to the relative differences in luminosity - weighted age at the moment the passive fading starts .",
    "the importance of these differences will depend , among other factors , on the relative sfrs of the progenitor spirals and their radial sfr profile before truncation .",
    "this would introduce additional scatter to the discussed result .",
    "however , there is a possible mechanism which would diminish this effect in the inner regions : a central starburst .",
    "if a central starburst precedes the truncation of the star formation , the central ages would be `` set to zero '' just before passive fading starts . in consequence ,",
    "relative differences in central age are minimised and the age versus @xmath78 relation becomes tighter .",
    "a central starburst has been proposed in the past as a possible ( even as a necessary ) step in the morphological transformation of a spiral into a s0 galaxy ( shioya et al .",
    "2004 , christlein & zabludoff 2004 ) and there is observational evidence in favour of this scenario ( poggianti et al . 2001 ; mehlert et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ; moss & whittle 2000 ) .",
    "the youngest galaxies of our fornax sample seem to have clear positive gradients in age , in agreement with this hypothesis . however , it will be in paper iii where we will be able to address this issue in detail , when we perform a detailed study of the stellar populations of these systems . also worthy of note in figure  [ fig : mb_age ] is the absence of a similar correlation between age and @xmath83 at all radii .",
    "first , this lack of correlation rules out the possibility that the correlation with @xmath84 could be spuriously driven by a correlation with @xmath83 , as discussed above .",
    "second and more interestingly , it implies that there is no compelling evidence for the `` downsizing '' scenario ( gavazzi 1993 , boselli et al .",
    "2001 , scodeggio et al .",
    "2002 ) in s0s , which would predict that the faintest galaxies should have the youngest stellar populations .",
    "+ although suggestive , these results are not yet definitive .",
    "the significance level of the age versus @xmath84 relation is not strong enough to totally discard the null hypothesis , and in case of a positive correlation , many questions remain open : does this relation depends on local environment ; do all s0s follow this trend or other properties , like luminosity , must be taken into account ? .",
    "clearly , what is needed is a larger set of high - quality data across a wide range of luminosities and environments to finally disentangle the life histories of these surprisingly complex objects .",
    "this paper presents the largest compilation of data to - date in a study of the tully  fisher relation of nearby s0 galaxies in both @xmath0 and @xmath1-bands , using new and archival results for a sample of 60 galaxies in different environments .",
    "the principal results of this study are :    * the local tfr of s0 galaxies presents a shift with respect to the local tfr of spirals .",
    "interpreted as a shift in luminosity , it amounts to between @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the @xmath0-band and between @xmath87 and @xmath88 in @xmath1-band , with the value depending on the calibration adopted for the spiral galaxy tfr . * in a scenario where s0 galaxies are the descendants of spirals at higher redshifts which have simply passively faded , these offsets are consistent with a population that has been passively fading for somewhere between 1 and 6 gyr ( again depending on the adopted calibration for the spiral galaxy tfr ) .",
    "if we include a starburst before the truncation of the star formation , the upper end of the possible timescale since transformation increases somewhat .",
    "however , the large scatter in the tfr means that such a simple model with a single epoch of formation can not provide the whole story . * the total scatter in the tfr of s0s",
    "is found to be @xmath89 mag in the @xmath0-band and @xmath90 in the @xmath1-band .",
    "our fitting indicates that only @xmath91 of this scatter can be attributed to the observational errors , with @xmath92 arising from the intrinsic astrophysical spread in the tfr .",
    "such a scatter could have been `` imprinted '' by the larger scatter in the spiral galaxy tfr at high redshift , or it could have arisen through the subsequent somewhat stochastic evolution of these systems . * to try to distinguish between these possibilities , we have looked for correlations between the offset from the tfr and other properties of these systems .",
    "morphologically , a number of s0 properties correlate with their absolute magnitudes , as seen in other galaxies , but none seem to correlate strongly with the offset of this magnitude from the spiral galaxy tfr . * by investigating line indices , we have been able to establish a reasonably strong correlation between the central ages of the fornax cluster galaxies stellar populations and their offsets from the tfr .",
    "this offset is in the sense and of the magnitude expected for a population of galaxies that transformed from spirals at various times in the past and has been passively fading ever since .",
    "a central starburst before the truncation of star formation would explain why the correlation is stronger with central age than at larger galactocentric distances .",
    "the new data from the fornax cluster show that we are finally in a position to use observations of nearby s0 galaxies to obtain important archaeological clues as to the mechanisms by which these systems form .",
    "however , the relatively small number of s0s in a single cluster will always limit the significance of the resulting measurements .",
    "clearly , we need a still - larger homogeneous dataset of the quality now attainable with telescopes like the vlt of s0 galaxies to finish off the work begun here .",
