    "the intrinsic three dimensional shapes of galaxies provide constraints for both dynamical models of galaxies as well as models of their evolutionary history .",
    "early simulations of hierarchical structure formation showed that baryons accrete and cool within galactic dark matter halos while acquiring some of the angular momentum of the dark matter via dynamical friction . as a result",
    "the baryons settle into cold thin tightly bound discs @xcite .",
    "more recent models including gas dissipation and feedback from star formation , as well the effect of mergers , result in the formation of more realistic structures for both disc and spheroidal galaxies @xcite . for disc galaxies , knowledge of the shape , particularly the intrinsic thickness of galaxy discs",
    "is also required to determine the inclination from the observed axial ratio .",
    "the inclination angle in turn , is an important input for determining the surface brightness profiles , modeling the dark matter halo etc .",
    "although theoretical modeling of galaxy shapes is a relatively recent development , there has been a long history of observational studies to determine the shapes of galaxies as a function of their morphological type .",
    "@xcite showed that as one goes from morphological type sa galaxies to type sd galaxies the stellar discs get thinner , but there is a sharp increase in thickness as on goes from sd galaxies to irregular galaxies ( their figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "@xcite also showed that intrinsic axial ratios of optical discs of sdm , sm and i m types ( types 8 , 9 and 10 as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the _ second reference catalogue _ have a wide distribution between @xmath80.2 and @xmath80.8 ( their figure 7 ) compared to the thin optical discs of earlier type spirals .",
    "@xcite showed that not only are the stellar distributions of irregular galaxies not well represented by spheroids with intrinsic axial ratios of @xmath80.2 as spiral galaxies are , but also that dwarf irregular galaxies are triaxial systems with axial ratios of 1:0.85:0.4 .",
    "@xcite showed that the bulges of bright elliptical galaxies were mildly triaxial structures , with two axes having comparable scale length , while the third is slightly smaller .",
    "interestingly , they also found that the stellar discs of bright spirals were also triaxial ( not merely thin oblate spheroids ) with the two larger axes having slightly differing scale lengths . in a recent study using the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 ( sdss - dr6 )",
    ", @xcite showed that though the intrinsic shapes of elliptical galaxies on the whole are consistent with oblate spheroids , when looked at separately low luminosity ellipticals are consistent with prolate spheroids and high luminosity ones with oblate spheroids .",
    "as for spiral galaxies , @xcite found that obscuration due to dust makes spiral discs appear rounder than they actually are .",
    "they determine that spirals have thin discs with slight face - on ellipticity , and the discs become thicker and more circular with increasing luminosity .",
    "there have also been a number of studies of the intrinsic shape of dwarf galaxies . @xcite",
    "analyzed data from 483 galaxies listed as ` dwarf ' or ` dwarf irregular ' in the ugc catalogue and found them to be thick oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axial ratio of 0.57 .",
    "@xcite showed that faint dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs have similar intrinsic shapes : highly elliptical thick discs . in a recent study @xcite assumed galaxies to be oblate spheroids and investigated the variation of the thickness with magnitude and stellar mass .",
    "they note that the thinnest discs are found around @xmath9  or equivalently around @xmath10 , and the discs become progressively fatter on either side .",
    "the brighter galaxies in their sample were drawn from sdss data release 7 ( sdss - dr7 ) , but galaxies with @xmath11 were taken from the catalogue of @xcite .    here we focus on the intrinsic shape of the stellar distribution in dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are the most numerous among all star forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use data from an updated survey of the local volume galaxies , which makes the sample for this study the largest among studies of the intrinsic shapes of dwarf galaxies , for galaxies with @xmath12 .",
    "we do not assume that the intrinsic shapes are oblate spheroids , but try and determine the shape from the data itself .",
    "as mentioned above , our sample is drawn from the updated local volume catalog , compiled by @xcite .",
    "the catalog consists of all galaxies with radial velocity with respect to centroid of local group @xmath13 or distance @xmath14 .",
    "optical axial ratios were measured at the holmberg isophote ( @xmath15 ) in the b - band . for some dwarf galaxies with extremely low surface brightness ( especially the ones which are resolved into individual stars )",
    "even the central brightness is fainter than the holmberg isophote . for these galaxies",
    "the axial ratio were measured from the ellipse whose major axis is equal to the scale - length of the brightness profile for that particular galaxy .",
    "morphological types according to the classification by @xcite were used to separate the galaxies into the three primary sub - samples listed in table  [ tab : groups ] .",
    "we label the three sub - samples as `` early types '' ( types @xmath168 to 0 , inclusive ) , `` late types '' ( types 1 to 7 , inclusive ) and `` irregulars '' ( types 8 to 10 , inclusive ) .",
    "the distributions of the observed axial ratios of the galaxies in the three sub - samples with @xmath17 are shown in figure  [ fig : all ] .",
    "this analysis quantifies what was discernible from the overall trends , viz . that irregular galaxies become thicker with fainter luminosities .",
    "the conclusions one can draw from figure  [ fig : optaxrat_inar ] are : +",
    "( i ) the bright irregular galaxies have slightly elliptical discs .",
    "that is they have triaxial shapes , with the two larger axes having slightly differing lengths , and the ratio of the smallest axis to the two larger axis being small and comparable to that for normal spirals",
    ". + ( ii ) the intermediate irregulars have somewhat thicker elliptical discs .",
    "their larger and smaller intrinsic axial ratios peak at @xmath80.7 , and @xmath80.4 respectively .",
    "+ ( iii ) in contrast to their brighter counterparts , the faint irregular galaxies are thick oblate spheroids , with the intrinsic axial ratio being @xmath80.5 .",
    "interestingly , their neutral hydrogen discs also appear to be puffy oblate spheroids with similar axial ratio @xcite .",
    "the increasing thickness of dwarf galaxy discs with decreasing luminosity can be understood in terms of the increasing importance of turbulent pressure support in stabilizing these galaxies . in the faintest systems ,",
    "the random motions can be comparable to the rotational speeds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly this trend towards thicker stellar discs has been reproduced in recent simulations of dwarf galaxy formation which include feedback due to star formation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one could conjecture that the tri - axiality of the brighter irregular galaxies reflects the fact that their star formation is patchy , leading to a high likelihood of the galaxy not having azimuthal symmetry .",
    "interestingly however , @xcite found that the discs of brighter spiral galaxies have ellipticity similar to what we find here for the irregular galaxies .",
    "the ellipticity of spiral discs has been confirmed by recent sdss based studies of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that a triaxial potential ( due to dark matter ) in the halos of large spirals as one of the possible causes for the difference in the scale - lengths of the two larger axes .",
    "given the general continuity in galaxy properties , one would expect that the same mechanism could be responsible for the ellipticity that we observe in our sample .",
    "in summary we use the compilation of galaxy axial ratios available in the local volume catalog , to determine the intrinsic shape of late type galaxies ( viz .",
    "de vaucouleurs types 8 , 9 and 10 ) .",
    "the brightest of these galaxies have thin discs , and the discs get thicker as one moves to fainter galaxies .",
