    "topological superconductivity is an interesting state of matter , partly because it is associated with quasiparticle excitations which are majorana fermions ( mfs ) . in particle physics , mfs",
    "are ( fermionic ) particles which are their own anti - particles  @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear if there are elementary particles which are mfs , but they are likely to exist as quasiparticle excitations in certain condensed matter systems , where a mf is a quasiparticle which is its `` own hole '' .",
    "the condensed matter version of mfs have attracted massive theoretical interest , mainly because of their special exchange statistics : they are non - abelian anyons  @xcite , meaning that particle exchanges are non - trivial operations which in general do not commute .",
    "this is unlike other known particle types where an exchange operation merely has the effect of multiplying the wavefunction with + 1 ( for bosons ) or -1 ( for fermions ) or a general phase factor @xmath2 ( for `` ordinary '' ( abelian ) anyons ) .",
    "furthermore , a mf is in a sense half of a normal fermion , meaning that a fermionc state is obtained as a superposition of two mfs .",
    "it should be noted , however , that any fermion can be written as a combination of two mfs , which basically corresponds to splitting the fermion into a real and an imaginary part , each of which is a mf .",
    "normally this is a purely mathematical operation without physical consequences , since the two mfs are spatially localized close to each other , overlap significantly , and can not be addressed individually .",
    "when we talk about mfs here , we mean that a fermionic state can be written as a superposition of two mfs which are _ spatially separated _ ( or prevented from overlapping in some other manner ) .",
    "such a highly delocalized fermionic state is protected from most types of decoherence , since it can not be changed by local perturbations affecting only one of its majorana constituents .",
    "the state can , however , be manipulated by physical exchange of mfs because of their non - abelian statistics , which has lead to the idea of low - decoherence _ topological _ quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "being its own hole means that a mf must be an equal superposition of an electron and a hole state .",
    "it is natural to search for such excitations in superconducting systems , where the wavefunctions of boguliubov quasiparticles have both an electron and a hole component .",
    "the most common type of superconducting pairing is of so - called @xmath1-wave symmetry , where cooper pairs are formed of electrons with opposite spin projections ( forming a singlet ) . in second quantization language",
    ", the annihilation operator of a boguliubov quasiparticle in an @xmath1-wave superconductor has the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 annihilates a normal fermion with spin projection @xmath5 ( we neglect for simplicity to write out additional quantum numbers which are irrelevant here ) . having _ equal _ electron and hole components mean that mfs are instead associated with an annihilation operator of the type @xmath6 , which is hermitian and therefore equal to the creation operator , @xmath7 .",
    "note that , in contrast to the @xmath1-wave boguliubov quasiparticle operator , the fermion operators making up the mf have equal spin projections . such quasiparticles do not occur in most types of superconductors and were instead first predicted to occur in the @xmath8 fractional quantum hall state  @xcite .",
    "however , as we will discuss in more detail below , isolated mfs occur in general in vortices and on edges of effectively spinless superconducting systems with triplet pairing symmetry  @xcite ( @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry in one dimension ( 1d ) and @xmath9 pairing symmetry in two dimensions ( 2d ) ) .",
    "triplet pairing has been predicted for the ground state of the superconductor sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11  @xcite , but is very sensitive to disorder and has never been observed experimentally .",
    "however , the existence of ( spatially separated ) mfs is a topological invariant  @xcite ( hence the name _ topological _ superconductors ) . as a result",
    ", they will exist in all systems with the same topological properties as a @xmath0-wave or @xmath12-wave superconductor ( we will come back to the precise meaning of this later ) .",
    "a few years ago , the search for mfs took a big step forward when fu and kane  @xcite showed that @xmath13-wave - like pairing may also occur for the surface states of a strong topological insulator when brought into tunneling contact with an ordinary @xmath1-wave superconductor ( giving rise to proximity - induced superconductivity  @xcite in the topological insulator ) .",
    "the necessary underlying physical ingredient is the strong spin - orbit coupling of the topological insulator , giving rise to split bands with momentum - dependent spin directions .",
    "in addition , by coupling the topological insulator also to a magnetic insulator , the resulting induced zeeman splitting lifts the kramer s degeneracy and allows an effectively spinless regime to be reached . however , as was realized shortly after the pioneering work of kane and fu , the strong spin - orbit coupling in certain two - dimensional semiconductor quantum wells should also do the job  @xcite . also here",
    "superconductivity can be induced through the proximity effect and magnetism either induced by a magnetic insulator  @xcite or provided by an external magnetic field  @xcite . shortly thereafter ,",
    "two works  @xcite suggested a further simplification by instead using 1d semiconducting wires . there have also been proposals to create mfs e.g. , in vortices in doped topological insulators  @xcite , on the interface between a ferromagnet and a superconductor deposited on a two - dimensional topological insulator  @xcite , in cold atomic gases  @xcite , in carbon nanotubes  @xcite , and using chains of quantum dots  @xcite , just to name a few .    during the last couple of years , a number of experimental groups have taken up the challenge to create mfs . very recently",
    "this quest may have seen success  @xcite , and several other groups have made observations which can be interpreted as signatures of majoranas  @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that these early findings will be scrutinized in future experiments and time will tell which are genuine observations of majorana physics . in any case , once mfs have been conclusively produced and detected in the lab , the truly exciting experimental work begins , to test their theoretically predicted properties and to design setups for ever more advanced manipulation of the quantum information they can encode .",
    "in this short review article we give an introduction to the topic of topological superconductivity and mfs , which is aimed at both experimental and theoretical physicists without prior knowledge of the field .",
    "we explain the generic necessary ingredients of topological superconductivity , as well as the basic properties of mfs , and how they can be realized in standard semiconductors proximity - coupled to @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "two excellent review articles discussing the subject have appeared recently  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt to give an exhaustive review of the subject , or to provide detailed derivations of all results , but instead focus on providing physical insight into what we feel are the most important basic concepts .",
    "we also try to convey the excitement over mfs by briefly discussing some of their exotic properties , such as the non - abelian statistics and the resulting potential for topological quantum computation",
    ". the text should be accessible for all readers with a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and the second quantization formalism .",
    "we start our discussion by introducing a simple hamiltonian , describing a spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor , which has eigenstates which are spatially isolated mfs .",
    "it is most intuitive to start from a 1d tight - binding chain with @xmath0-wave superconducting pairing , as first introduced by kitaev  @xcite , described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 means hermitian conjugate , @xmath16 is the chemical potential , @xmath17 is the electron annihilation operator for site @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the associated number operator . the superconducting gap , @xmath20 , and hopping , @xmath21 , are assumed to be the same for all sites",
    ". we can then choose the superconducting phase @xmath2 to be zero , such that @xmath22 .",
    "note that time - reversal symmetry is broken in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kitaevh ] ) since we only consider one value for the spin projection , i.e. , effectively spinless electrons ( we suppress the spin label ) .",
    "furthermore , the superconducting pairing is non - standard since it couples electrons with the same spin ( in contrast to standard @xmath1-wave pairing , which only couples electrons with opposite spin projection ) .",
    "note also that electrons on neighboring sites are paired : the sites can not be doubly occupied by the spinless electrons because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we now want to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : kitaevh ] ) in terms of majorana operators ( we will see shortly why this is useful ) .",
    "it was mentioned above that mfs are basically obtained by splitting a fermion into its real and imaginary parts . therefore we write @xmath23 where @xmath24 are majorana operators living on site @xmath18 . that they are indeed majorana operators is seen by inverting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kitaevmfannihilation])([eq : kitaevmfcreation ] ) , giving @xmath25 which are clearly hermitian and therefore majorana operators . figure  [ fig : kitaev ] shows a sketch of kitaev s chain and the upper panel indicates how the fermion operators on each site are split into majorana operators .     sketch of kitaev s 1d @xmath0-wave superconducting tight binding chain .",

    "lower panel : in the limit @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the hamiltian is diagonal in fermion operators which are obtained by combing instead majorana operators on neighboring sites , @xmath30 and @xmath27 .",
    "this leaves two unpaired majorana operators , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which can be combined to form one zero energy , highly non - local fermion operator , @xmath33 . ]    the majorana physics is most easily understood when @xmath34 , @xmath29 , in which case inserting eqs .",

    "[ fig : kitaev ] . in terms of these new fermions",
    "we find @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 thus , @xmath36 are the annihilation operators corresponding to the eigenstates and the energy cost of creating a @xmath40 fermion is @xmath41 .",
    "the majorana operators are merely a formal way of writing the hamiltonian and the physical excitations are fermionic states at finite energy , obtained by a superposition of nearest neighbor mfs .",
    "so far there appears to be nothing special about the diagonal hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kitaevhmf ] ) and  ( [ eq : kitaevhdiag ] ) . however , the majorana operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are localized at the two ends of the wire , are completely missing from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kitaevhmf ] ) !",
    "these two majorana operators can equivalently be described by a single fermionic state with operator @xmath44 this is a highly non - local state since @xmath42 and @xmath43 are localized on opposite ends of the chain .",
    "furthermore , since this fermion operator is absent from the hamiltonian , occupying the corresponding state requires zero energy .",
    "thus , in contrast to `` normal '' superconductors , where the ground state is non - degenerate and consists of a superposition of even - particle - number states ( condensate of cooper pairs ) , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : kitaevh ] ) allows for an odd number of quasiparticles at zero energy cost .",
    "the ground state is therefore two - fold degenerate , corresponding to having in total an even or odd number of electrons in the superconductor .",
    "this even or oddness , also called parity , corresponds to the eigenvalue of the number operator of the zero - energy fermion , @xmath45 for even ( odd ) parity .",
    "the above argument was made for the very special case @xmath46 and @xmath28 , but one can show that the majorana end states remain as long as the chemical potential lies within the gap  @xcite , @xmath47 .",
    "in the general case , however , the mfs are not completely localized only at the two edge sites of the wire , but decay exponentially away from the edges .",
    "the mfs remain at zero energy only if the wire is long enough that they do not overlap .",

    "they will also appear at transition points between topological and non - topological regions .",
    "for example , if the chemical potential or the hopping amplitude varies along the wire and @xmath52 in some segment , two additional mfs will appear at the transition points where the gap closes  @xcite .",
    "similarly , in a 2d @xmath9-wave superconductor , mfs appear in vortices in the superconducting pairing potential  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , mfs can appear if the gap is closed by variations in the chemical potential or electrostatic potential  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that isolated mfs can appear even in a spinful @xmath9-wave superconductor , in so - called half - quantum vortices  @xcite , where there is a vortex for only one direction of the triplet ( note that this also means a breaking of time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "if there are in total an odd number of gap closings , an additional mf will appear somewhere in the system to guarantee that there is always an even number ( exactly where this additional mf appears depends on the details , see ref .",

    "before explaining how mfs can be realized in more realistic systems , we now discuss in more detail some of their generic properties , which are independent of the specific system in which they appear .",
    "let us assume that we have a system with @xmath53 spatially well - separated mfs , @xmath54 .",
    "the number of mfs is necessarily even since one mf contains half the degrees of freedom of a normal fermion .",

    "( [ eq : anticommutation ] ) , we see that @xmath60 .",
    "thus , acting twice with a majorana operator , we get back the same state we started with .",
    "there is therefore no pauli principle for mfs ( cf .",
    ", @xmath61 for normal fermion operators @xmath62 ) .",
    "in fact , we can not even speak of the occupancy of a majorana mode .",
    "we can try to count the occupancy by constructing a `` majorana number operator '' , @xmath63 .",
    "however , using hermiticity , @xmath64 , together with @xmath60 , we find @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the majorana mode is in a sense always empty and always filled and counting does not make any sense .",
    "it would still be very useful to use some sort of number states .",
    "these are instead provided through the @xmath55 fermions as we already saw above in the example with kitaev s chain",
    ". since these are normal fermions , there are number states @xmath67 which are eigenstates of the fermionic number operators , @xmath68 , with eigenvalue @xmath69 ( by pauli exclusion principle ) .",
    "note that the labelling of the @xmath70 s , and thereby the pairing into fermionic states , is arbitrary and merely represents a choice of basis for the number states .",
    "however , if two mfs come close enough to overlap , it is natural to choose to combine them into a fermion . to describe an overlap , @xmath21 , between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the only term one can introduce into the hamiltonian is @xmath73 which corresponds to a finite energy cost for occupying the corresponding fermionic state ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "the sum of all occupation numbers , @xmath77 , being even or odd now reflects whether the total number of electrons in the superconductor is even or odd ( even or odd parity ) . to change the parity",
    ", electrons have to be physically added to or removed from the superconductor .",
    "the experimentally measurable quantities are the occupation numbers @xmath76 .",
    "such a measurement can be done by bringing two mfs close together and measuring the energy of the corresponding state  @xcite , which reveals the occupation through eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) .",
    "one could also use interferometry  @xcite or coupling to conventional superconducting qubits  @xcite . note that it does not make sense to talk about the `` state of a mf '' since a single mf contains only `` half a degree of freedom '' .",
    "the only physical observables are the fermionic occupation numbers .",
    "it is a crucial ingredient for non - abelian statistics to have a degenerate groundstate , which is separated from all excited states by a gap ( ideally the induced superconducting gap , but it could also be a smaller gap to for example finite - energy vortex- or edge states ) .",
    "then adiabatic operations , such as the slow exchange of quasiparticle positions , can in principle bring the system from one groundstate to another .",
    "it is , of course , not obvious that such a transformation indeed takes place , which will depend on the details of the system . in the case of mfs in a @xmath9 superconductor , ivanov  @xcite provided a simple and elegant proof of the non - abelian statistics which we sketch here .",

    "topologically , this is equivalent to two successive exchanges .",

    "thus , exchanging the two mfs has the rather mundane effect of multiplying the number states with a phase factor .",
    "in fact , it is natural that the exchange operation can not change the eigenvalue of the number operator in a system with only two mfs , since this encodes whether there are in total an even or odd number of particles in the superconductor , a quantity which is not changed by particle exchanges . to find non - trivial effects of exchange operations we must consider a system with at least four mfs , described in terms of the fermionic number states @xmath95 .",
    "let us now investigate the effect of exchanging neighboring mfs , described by braid operators @xmath96 . for simplicity",
    "we choose the branch cuts of all mfs to be in the same direction and number the mfs based on their position orthogonal to this direction , such that when exchanging mfs @xmath18 and @xmath97 in a clockwise manner , vortex @xmath18 crosses _ only _ the branch cut of vortex @xmath98 , and no other vortices cross any branch cuts ( crossing the same branch cut twice in different directions is equivalent to not crossing any branch cuts at all ) .",

    "the attentive reader might be slightly upset by a simple fact we have neglected .",
    "namely the question of what exactly qualifies as an exchange operation .",
    "if we define an exchange operation as bringing one vortex exactly to the old position of another vortex , and vice versa , there is no problem .",
    "but clearly this is not possible in reality and certainly goes against the idea of robust topological quantum information processing to be discussed below .",
    "( in networks of 1d wires it is somewhat easier to find a satisfying definition of particle exchanges  @xcite . ) mathematically , the exchange process happens when the branch cut is crossed , but since this is arbitrarily defined , it is not a good definition either .",
    "physically , the solution to this problem is that there is no measurable effect of the exchange process , unless it is followed by one of the two mfs involved in the exchange being joined with a third mf to perform a measurement of the state of the fermion formed by this pair .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange2 ] .",
    "sketch demonstrating two equivalent sets of operations . in the upper panel , mfs 2 and 3",
    "are first exchanged ( black arrows ) , then the nearest neighbor mfs are brought together ( magenta arrows ) and the states of the corresponding fermions are measured . in the lower panel , there is no exchange , but instead we directly measure the fermions formed by pairing next - nearest neighboring mfs ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) . ]    in the upper panel , two neighboring mfs are first exchanged , which is followed by measuring the fermionic states formed by pairing the nearest neighbor mfs . in the lower panel , on the other hand , we do not exchange the mfs , but instead measure directly the fermionic states formed by pairing next - nearest neighboring mfs .",
    "both these operations give the same result for the measurements of the fermionic states and are therefore equivalent .",
    "therefore , a `` computation '' can be defined either as a set of exchanges , or by defining the combinations of pairs that are being measured at the end , which removes the ambiguity in defining an exchange process .    another way of seeing this is to note that the result of a set of exchange operations depends on the topology of the `` world lines '' of the mfs ( or other particles ) .",
    "the world lines start when pairs of mfs are created from the vacuum , cross each other when mfs are exchanged , and end when pairs of mfs are measured ( fused ) . only sets of world lines",
    "which are topologically distinct can lead to different results , which defines the so - called braid group , of which the mf exchange statistics is one possible representation ( fermions , bosons , and abelian anyons in general are the more trivial one - dimensional representations ) .",
    "non - abelian representations of the braid group exist only in 2d ( networks of 1d wires are also effectively 2d ) .",
    "@xcite provides a more complete mathematical discussion of these issues .",
    "we saw above that parity conservation prevented braiding operations from changing the state of a system with only two mfs .",
    "for this reason , the two - level system spanned by the number operator @xmath106 is not suitable to use as a qubit . to define a ( topological ) majorana qubit",
    ", we should therefore use four mfs , meaning two normal fermions  @xcite , and consider the case of fixed parity ( even or odd ) of the total number of fermions .",
    "let us consider the even parity subspace and define a qubit by @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "in the basis @xmath109 , the pauli matrices can be represented in terms of products of majorana operators @xmath110 which is seen by calculating the corresponding matrix elements . in the standard representation with @xmath111 and @xmath112 being respectively the north and south poles of the block sphere , we can then identify the different braids with single - qubit rotations @xmath113 thus , by braiding operations we can only perform single - qubit rotations by an angle @xmath114 .",
    "when considering a multi - qubit setup , the most obvious choice is to define each qubit in terms of four mfs  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not possible to construct a two - qubit gate based on braiding operations which is able to create entanglement between two such qubits .",
    "in addition , this choice does not use all the degrees of freedom offered by the system .",
    "even with conservation of the parity of the total number of fermions , a system with @xmath53 mfs has in principle enough degrees of freedom to store @xmath115 qubits .",
    "braiding - based gates acting on such `` overlapping '' qubit systems have been considered in ref .",
    "no matter how the majorana - based qubits are defined , braiding operations can only explore a tiny fraction of the total hilbert space and are insufficient for universal quantum computation , which can , however , be achieved by including also non - protected operations  @xcite , or by coupling majorana qubits to other qubit systems  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of majorana - based qubits is that they keep the quantum information encoded in delocalized fermionic states .",
    "therefore , they are expected to be robust against most sources of decoherence which do not couple simultaneously to more than one majorana mode , i.e. , decoherence requires perturbations of the form @xmath116 , which are suppressed when mfs @xmath18 and @xmath117 are spatially separated .",
    "an exception is processes which change the total parity of the superconductor , e.g. , by electrons tunneling into a majorana mode  @xcite . such perturbations involve a single majorana operator ( they are @xmath118 ) and are not suppressed by keeping the mfs spatially separated .",
    "in fact , this phenomena , known as quasiparticle poisoning  @xcite , is a well - known problem in conventional ( non - topological ) superconducting qubits .",
    "having seen how majorana fermions appear in spinless @xmath0-wave ( or @xmath9-wave ) superconductors , we will now investigate how such exotic pairing can be engineered using more readily available ingredients .",
    "we start , however , by considering the generic effects of proximity - induced superconductivity .",
    "the system we have in mind is a @xmath119-dimensional semiconductor , where @xmath120 ( wire ) or @xmath121 ( quantum well ) . neglecting electron",
    " electron interactions ( or including them in a mean - field manner ) , the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath122 where the first quantization single - particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath123 where @xmath51 is the effective electron mass , @xmath124 is an applied magnetic field , @xmath125 is the bohr magneton , @xmath126 is the land @xmath126 factor , and @xmath127 is a vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction with strength @xmath128 has been written in the most general form in terms of the electric field @xmath129 felt by the valence electrons , and can involve both rashba and dresselhaus terms .",
    "if a good interface is made between a semiconductor and a superconductor , electrons can tunnel between these two systems .",
    "the effect is that the electrons in the semiconductor feels an effective `` proximity - induced '' superconducting pairing field  @xcite .",
    "the strength of this pairing field depends on the details of the semiconductor and superconductor , as well as the interface .",
    "we do not attempt to make an accurate microscopic model , but instead include the pairing effect in the semiconductor by the phenomenological hamiltonian @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the pairing potential .",
    "the pairing symmetry is inherited from the superconductor , which we have here assumed to be @xmath1-wave , inducing singlet pairing between spin - up and spin - down electrons .    when dealing with superconducting systems , it is standard practice to include both the electrons and the holes explicitly by introducing so - called nambu spinors @xmath132 matrices acting on the nambu spinors must have dimension @xmath133 and we introduce pauli matrices @xmath134 , similar to @xmath135 , but acting in electron - hole space .",
    "matrices such as @xmath136 then have the appropriate @xmath133 structure .",

    "the term @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0bar ] ) denotes the time - reversal of @xmath139 and appears since holes are time - reversed electrons .",
    "( note , however , that we have not introduced any new physics with the matrices in eqs .",

    "the quasiparticle excitations of a superconducting system are given by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the eigenstates @xmath144 ( which are also four - component spinors ) @xmath145 and the diagonalized hamiltonian becomes @xmath146    as was mentioned above , the nambu spinors were only introduced to provide a convenient matrix representation of the hamiltonian . however , by explicitly including the hole states and thus doubling the dimension of the hamiltonian , we have also artificially doubled the number of eigenstates .",
    "therefore , there must be some symmetry relation between the eigenstates such that the number of independent solutions remains the same .",
    "this symmetry is electron - hole symmetry , which is expressed through the operator @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the operator for complex conjugation .",
    "it can then be verified that @xmath149 this means that if @xmath150 and @xmath151 are solutions with positive energy @xmath152 , then there are also solutions @xmath153 and @xmath154 with energy @xmath155 which satisfy @xmath156 in other words , creating a quasiparticle with energy @xmath157 or removing one with energy @xmath158 are identical operations .",
    "it is possible to engineer the parameters in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) such that it resembles a spinless @xmath0-wave or @xmath9 superconductor and has eigenstates which are mfs .",
    "we will discuss how to accomplish this in the following section , but can already now derive a few of the generic properties majorana solutions to eq .",

    "the corresponding real - space majorana spinor satisfies @xmath161 , and its most general form is therefore @xmath162    let us now assume that the hamiltonian respects time - reversal symmetry , @xmath163 , where the time - reversal operator is @xmath164 .",
    "then , if @xmath144 is an eigenstate , also @xmath165 must be an eigenstate with the same energy .",
    "this is nothing else than kramer s theorem for a superconductor .",
    "specifically for mfs , the kramer s partner to the majorana spinor @xmath166 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : realspacemf ] ) is @xmath167 importantly , the probability densities associated with each kramer s pair are identical @xmath168 thus , if we want to create spatially isolated mfs ( not accompanied by a kramer s partner with identical probability density ) , we need a hamiltonian which breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we note that it is possible for pairs of mfs to remain at zero energy in the presence of time - reversal symmetry even if they are not spatially separated . for a full classification of different topological classes , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the strategy is now to engineer the parameters in the semiconductor hamiltonians  ( [ eq : h0])([eq : hs ] ) , such that the total hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) is close enough to that of a spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor ( eq .  ( [ eq : pgap1d ] ) ) to also host mfs ( we focus here on the simplest case of a 1d nanowire , but the case of a 2d quantum well is rather similar ) .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) and eq .",

    "since the presence of spatially separated mfs is a topological property of the system  @xcite , they should then appear also as solutions to eq .",

    "a set of gate electrodes are used to control the chemical potential inside the wire and bring it into the topological regime .",

    "the chemical potential of the wire is controlled by a set of gate electrodes .",
    "the wire is assumed to be long enough that we can ignore size quantization along the wire direction and thin enough that the 1d subbands are well separated on the relevant energy scales . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the chemical potential can be tuned to a regime where only a single 1d subband is occupied ( mfs can also be found in multi - channel wires  @xcite provided that the channel number is odd and the effective width of the wire is smaller than the superconducting coherence length ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0r ] ) @xmath169 where we have taken @xmath170 .",

    "note that the direction of the electric field in a realistic setup is unknown due to the presence of the superconductor and electric gates .",
    "however , since the spin - orbit field is given by a cross product of the electric field and the momentum , it is orthogonal to the wire and we choose it to be along the @xmath174-direction .",
    "only the magnetic field component orthogonal to the spin - orbit field will help to induce topological superconductivity and we choose the field to be along the @xmath175-axis .",
    "we assume the proximity - induced pairing field to be homogeneous and to couple only electrons at the same position , @xmath176 in eq .",

    "when @xmath179 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) , the spin - orbit coupling shifts the two parabolic bands depending on their spin polarization along the axis of the spin - orbit field . however , at any given energy there is still spin degeneracy since time - reversal symmetry is not broken .",
    "switching on a small @xmath178 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](b ) , the crossing at zero momentum turns into an anti - crossing .",
    "the lower band has a double - well shape and the gap to the upper band is determined by @xmath178 ( only the component of the magnetic field orthogonal to the spin - orbit field opens up a gap ) .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hwire ] ) is easily diagonalized , resulting in @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 correspond to the upper and lower bands , respectively . inside the gap , there is only one effective spin direction ( although this direction depends on momentum ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath16 is placed inside the gap , spinless superconductivity can be induced by the proximity effect .",
    "note that without the @xmath186-dependence of the spin direction , it would not be possible to induce superconductivity by proximity with a @xmath1-wave superconductor , since the pairing term in eq .  ( [ eq : hs ] ) only couples the components of the spins which are anti - parallel . a larger @xmath178 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](c ) , increases the gap between the bands .",
    "this makes the effectively spinless regime larger and therefore provides a larger window in which to place the chemical potential .",
    "this is important if disorder causes the the chemical potential to vary over the length of the wire .",
    "however , the larger field also enforces an increased alignment of the spins within each band and therefore makes it harder to induce superconductivity .",
    "next we switch on also the proximity - induced superconducting pairing , @xmath182 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](d ) . here",
    "we plot all the solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations , eq .",

    "the gap at zero momentum decreases with increasing @xmath20 and closes completely when @xmath188 . for larger values of @xmath20",

    "the criteria for topological superconductivity is therefore @xmath189 the phase transition between the topological and non - topological superconducting states can _ only _ take place at the point where the gap closes .",
    "therefore , to show that the criteria  ( [ eq : topcrit ] ) indeed guarantees topological superconductivity , it is sufficient to consider a certain limit of the topological phase and there provide a mapping to the spinless @xmath0-wave superconducting wire in eq .",

    "note that the effective strength of the superconducting pairing term has been reduced by a factor @xmath197 , corresponding to the polarization of the spin within the lower band , suppressing superconducting pairing .    from the above discussion and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : topcrit ] ) , it may seem like an arbitrarily small proximity - induced gap is sufficient for topological superconductivity . however , the stability of the superconducting phase depends also on the size of the gap at finite momentum ( see fig .  [",

    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "if the gap is too small , the topological superconducting phase , although reached in the idealized model considered here , will in reality be destroyed e.g. , by finite temperature or disorder .",

    "a large zeeman splitting ensures a large gap at zero momentum , which is important since the chemical potential must be placed within the gap .",

    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity to disorder increases when time - reversal symmetry is strongly violated for electrons close to the fermi level  @xcite , meaning when the spins at @xmath199 are almost aligned . to avoid this , and keep robostness against disorder",

    "their peculiar non - abelian ( non - commutative ) exchange statistics was discussed , and the basic concepts of majorana qubits and topological quantum computation was introduced . finally , we discussed the possibility to realize topological superconductivity by bringing semiconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling into proximity with standard @xmath1-wave superconductors and exposing them to a magnetic field .",
    "while this manuscript was being finalized , a report of the possible observation of mfs in 1d nanowires was published  @xcite , and around the same time several other groups reported observations which can be interpreted as signatures of majoranas  @xcite ( for space reasons we have here not discussed the issue of majorana detection , see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "clearly the types of systems investigated in the hunt for majoranas contain a lot of new and exciting physics , but which experimental observation are indeed genuine majorana sightings remains to be seen .",
    "we also mention that in a real system , with a finite size and interactions which may not be well described within a mean - field picture , there is not necessarily a perfectly clear and unique definition of a mf .    in any case , once mfs can be reproducibly realized and detected in the lab , the work has only started .",
    "further studies will have to investigate their properties in detail , and fabrication and measurement techniques will have to be perfected .",
    "no doubt , there will also be a need for additional theoretical work to understand the experimental findings . on a longer timescale ,",
    "the goal is of course to be able to control and manipulate quantum information stored in majorana - based qubit systems . if there will be a useful technological application at the end of this long road is too early to predict , but there is certainly a lot of interesting and new physics to explore ."
