    "there are two problems when considering an inelastic scattering processes : the first problem is the calculation of a multidimensional integral ( [ crosssection ] ) ; and the second problem is the large number of such integrals .",
    "@xmath1    the first problem may be solved using the laplace method .",
    "now let us consider the so called disconnected diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . in the language of diagrams : we need to connect the lines of secondary particles @xmath2 to the diagram vertices @xmath3 in all possible ways . for each way of connection",
    "we need to calculate the interference contribution i.e. the integral ( [ crosssection ] ) .",
    "there are @xmath4 possible ways of such connections .",
    "it means that we need to calculate @xmath4 multidimentional integrals .",
    "it is not a problem for a small number of secondary particles ( e.g. for five or seven ) .",
    "however , for the process with a large number ( 20,50,60 ... ) of secondary particles , it is impossible to calculate all interference contributions directly .",
    ".the number of the interference contributions for the different secondary particles number . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     obviously , it is impossible to build all the permutations even for 30 particles nowadays , and thus to account all 30 ! possible interference contributions .",
    "our method makes it possible to calculate the interference contributions for up to hundred secondary particles .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath5 depends on the four - momenta of the secondary paritcles .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the @xmath6-dimentional vector @xmath7 , which includes all the necessary variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . and",
    "so let us write @xmath12 .",
    "the scattering amplitude may be given in the following form :    @xmath13    as it was shown in @xcite , the scattering amplitude @xmath12 has a maximum point @xmath14 at fixed energy @xmath15 , and by applying taylor expansion near the maximum point @xmath14 up to second derivatives :    @xmath16    where    @xmath17    the diagonalization of matrix @xmath18 yields several one - dimentional integrals instead of a single multidimentional one .",
    "first of all we need to introduce the definition of the `` normal connection '' or `` normal order '' .",
    "let us connect first line to the first vertex , second line to the second vertex and so on .",
    "from now on let us call it a _",
    "`` normal order '' _ or a _",
    "`` normal connection''_. now we can consider all the possible connections as the permutations of the seconrady particles in normal order .",
    "[ normal ]    it is important that the secondary particle rapidities make up the arithmetic progression at the maximum point of scattering amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ normal ] right ) , while @xmath19 and the central particle has a zero rapidity .",
    "the permutations of the secondary particles ( different connections ) at low energies lead to the same maximum point of scattering amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ samepoint ] ) , thus there are many similar contributions which are easy to calculate .",
    "this is not true for the high energies .",
    "however , at high energies it is possible to combine the secondary particles into the groups in such a way that the permutations of the particles inside the groups do not change the maximum point .",
    "it means , that the rapidities of the particles from the same group are equal .",
    "the problem of accounting of all @xmath4 interference contributions may be solved in two steps :    1 .    the first step is the consideration of all possible permutations inside the groups - _ inner permutations _ 2 .",
    "the second step is the consideration of all possible ways ( methods ) of groups filling - _",
    "external permutations_.    @xmath20    from now on the laplace method may be applied to the partial sum of the interference contributions :    @xmath21    all inner permutations may be accounted by the combinatorial coefficients . each external permutation may be represented by @xmath22-dimentional matrix .",
    "@xmath23    the matrix element @xmath24 shows how many patricles are taken from the @xmath25 group of the normal order and then pushed to the @xmath26 group of the new permutation .",
    "each of these contributions has a weighting factor @xmath27 : @xmath28    in this way the number of necessary calculations of the multidimentional integrals is reduced by finding the similar interference contributions and accounting all of them by combinatorial coefficients .",
    "so it becomes possible to calculate all the interference contributions for the processes with a large number ( up to hundred ) of the secondary particles .",
    "as a result of this method application , a qualitative description of inclusive rapidity distribution was achieved .",
    "*   connect the particle lines from the central group on left side to the particles from the central group on the right side ( fig .",
    "[ cut ] ) .",
    "it is these lines that produce the maximum at zero point , since the particles from the central groups have zero rapidities .",
    "*   connect the particle lines from / to the non - central groups ( fig .",
    "[ cut ] ) .",
    "the lines of this type shift the maximum from zero , because the particles in non - central groups have nonzero rapidities .",
