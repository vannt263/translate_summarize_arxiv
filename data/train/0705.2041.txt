    "the concept of a `` field '' population of galaxies as distinct from the group / cluster populations has existed since the earliest days of extragalactic astronomy ( hubble 1936 ) and it is used recurrently in studies aimed to explore the effects of large  scale environment on galaxy properties . however , the definition of `` field '' is fuzzy .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in space is actually strongly clustered and a large fraction of them is prone to form gravitationally - bound multiple systems , from very populated clusters to loose groups , the majority being in normal groups ( tully 1987 ) . _",
    "isolation _ is an important requirement beyond the concept of `` field '' galaxies .",
    "a galaxy is isolated if it has not suffered any interaction with another normal galaxy or with a group environment over a hubble time or at least since approximately one half of its mass was assembled .",
    "this makes the observational finding and study of isolated galaxies important because , among other reasons , ( i ) they can be used as comparison objects in studies of the environmental effects on galaxies belonging to groups and clusters , and ( ii ) they are ideal for confronting with theoretical and model predictions of galaxy evolution .",
    "the fact that properties of galaxies change with environment has been known for a long time .",
    "the main observable dependencies with environment from cluster centers to the sparse `` field'' are seen for the morphological mix , the global colors , and the specific star formation ( sf ) rate ; for recent reviews see park et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , avila - reese et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and the references therein .",
    "these properties are inferred mainly from photometric observations .",
    "in fact , to study observationally the effects of high  density environments on the galaxy properties , a good understanding of the isolated , non  perturbed , galaxies is necessary .",
    "these galaxies are also required as a control sample for studying interacting galaxies .",
    "for example , in hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "( 2005 ; see also conselice 2003 ) we have compared the photometric concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness parameters of local interacting and `` field '' disk galaxies with the aim to establish a relatively easy way for identifying interacting disk galaxies in high  redshfit samples .    among isolated galaxies ,",
    "the observational study of disk galaxies is of special interest because , on one hand , they are expected to be more drastically affected by environmental and interaction effects ; on the other hand , according to the current paradigm of cosmic structure formation , the formation of disks inside hierarchically growing cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes is a generic process .",
    "a large amount of work has been done in modeling the evolution of ( isolated ) disk galaxies .",
    "well observed samples of isolated disk galaxies are hence important in order to confront with model predictions ( e.g. , avila  reese & firmani 2000 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; boissier & prantzos 2000 ; firmani & avila ",
    "reese 2000 ; yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ; zavala et al .",

    "; kassin , de jong & weiner 2006 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a uniformly selected and observed sample of isolated disk galaxies is also crucial for studying intrinsic secular processes able to affect the structure , morphology and dynamics of galaxies , for instance , the formation and evolution of bars , circular rings , lopsidedness , and bulges .",
    "however , chances are that isolated galaxies may show evidence of disturbances not associated with intrinsic processes , which opens the necessity to explore other alternatives . on this line , cosmological numerical simulations within the cdm model show that inside the galaxy  size haloes there survives a large population of subhaloes ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , but reionization and feedback could inhibit the formation of luminous ( satellite ) galaxies inside most of these subhaloes ( e.g. , bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "the subhalos and the associated gas clouds could produce signs of distortion on isolated galaxies ( threntam , moller & ramirez - ruiz 2001 ; pisano , wilcots & liu 2002 ) .",
    "if these signs are clear , then observations in radio could reveal the presence of 21cm hydrogen line emission associated to a pure gas companion galaxy .",
    "but if such an emission is absent , there is still the possibility that the perturber is just a dark matter ( sub)halo without any baryonic component ( threntam et al .",
    "recently , karachentsev , karachentseva & huchtmeier ( 2006 ) , by analyzing a large sample of isolated galaxies , have reported the finding of four such possible cases .",
    "homogeneous observational data samples of isolated disk galaxies are crucial for obtaining transparent scaling relationships and correlations that can be appropriately confronted with model predictions ( see , e.g. zavala et al .",
    "2003 ) . in recent years",
    ", some groups have been working on the compilation and observation of such samples ( e.g. , pisano et al .",
    "2002 ; allam et al . 2005 ; koopmann & kenney 2006 ) . for galaxies in voids , which are the most likely",
    "to be isolated , see rojas et al .",
    "( 2004,2005 ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that the important requirements for all these samples are : well defined and strong isolation criteria , a uniform - quality data acquisition in several wavelengths , and completeness when possible .    we have carried out optical ccd photometry for a representative set of galaxies in the northern catalogue of isolated galaxies ( hereafter cig , karachentseva 1973 ) .",
    "this is one of the best defined and most complete catalogues of isolated galaxies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a global @xmath0 photometric and morphological analysis for a subsample of 44 spiral galaxies from the cig catalog .",
    "it is strongly emphasized that all the observations were done with the same ccd detector . after applying uniform reduction and analysis procedures , an homogeneous set of photometric and morphological data",
    "is guaranteed .",
    "cig galaxies cover a wide range in luminosities , surface brightnesses , morphological types and colors .",
    "their relative simplicity and closeness , as compared with galaxies in other environments , offer a unique opportunity to have a more detailed and less confused interpretation of their structural , photometric and morphological properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ datasample ] summarizes the selection criteria applied to the isolated galaxy sample that are relevant to our photometric study , and describes the observations and reduction techniques used here .",
    "section [ magnitudes ] presents a comparison of our estimated total magnitudes against those in the literature . in section [ morphology ] , we discuss the observed morphology based on mosaic @xmath7band and @xmath7band sharp / filtered images , @xmath8 color index maps , and composed near  infrared ( nir ) @xmath3 images extracted from the two  micron survey archives . emphasis is put on the presence of disturbed morphology .",
    "section [ physmorphology ] presents our estimates of the optical ( @xmath0 ) and nir @xmath9band concentration , asymmetry , and clumpiness ( @xmath4 ) structural parameters . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we explore and discuss some basic correlations among the @xmath10 photometric and structural parameters in this sample that could be useful for comparative studies involving galaxies in other environments .",
    "section [ s5 ] provides a summary of the paper .",
    "finally , an appendix is devoted to the presentation of @xmath0 magnitudes at two other concentric circular apertures .",
    "we have carried out an observational program at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir ( oan - spm ) , baja california , mxico , devoted to obtain uniform ccd photometric data for one of the most complete and homogeneous samples of isolated galaxies currently available , the cig catalogue of karachentseva ( 1973 ) .",
    "this sample amounts to more than 1050 galaxies in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the ccd @xmath0 images in the johnson - cousins system were obtained with a site1 detector attached to the 1.5 m and 0.84 m telescopes at oan - spm covering an area of about @xmath11 and @xmath12 , a typical seeing of 1.7 arcsec and a scale of 0.51@xmath13/pixel and 0.85@xmath13/pixel respectively .    the original number of galaxies in three observing runs amounts to 52 galaxies . from these ,",
    "6 galaxies obtained under bad observing conditions and 2 ellipticals were eliminated , yielding a final sample of 44 isolated spiral galaxies of the present study .",
    "we applied no special strategy in selecting this current subset .",
    "availability of observing time and weather conditions were the main factors constraining the number of observed galaxies .",
    "some aspects of the selection criteria for the cig sample that are most relevant to the present and further photometric analyses are stated here .",
    "the isolated galaxies in the cig sample were selected from a visual search of the palomar sky survey .",
    "the catalogue samples the sky north of @xmath14 .",
    "the vast majority of objects is found in high galactic latitude regions ( @xmath15 ) and as a sample , it is reasonably complete ( @xmath16% ) in the magnitude range @xmath17 ( hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "the selection criteria used in assembling the cig can be expressed by the following relations :    @xmath18    where@xmath19 is the apparent separation between the candidate isolated galaxy of apparent diameter @xmath20 and any other neighbor galaxy of apparent diameter @xmath21 . under these criteria ,",
    "any other galaxy of comparable size ( @xmath22 ) should be at a distance of at least 20 times its diameter ( projected on the sky ) from the isolated galaxy .    assuming a typical galaxy diameter d @xmath23 20 kpc and a peculiar velocity relative to the hubble flow v @xmath24 km s@xmath25 ( rivolo & yahil 1981 ) , the time required for an intruder galaxy to traverse 20 diameters is @xmath26 yr .",
    "this is a first - order estimate of the time since the last equal - size galaxy - galaxy interaction for a cig system and it suggests that cig galaxies are reasonably isolated .",
    "it is therefore expected that only the intrinsic properties of the individual galaxies in the cig should influence the observed photometric and morphological properties .",
    "karachentseva ( 1973 ) included other isolation criteria ( coded as 1 and 2 in her original catalogue ) depending on whether or not other galaxies , within a factor of 4 in size , were found near a 20 diameter boundary or even if a galaxy is definitely not isolated according to the cig criteria .",
    "less isolated galaxies account for less than @xmath27 of our cig sample and have been excluded from the present study .",
    "a journal of the photometric observations is given in table 1 .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the original catalogue number , columns ( 2)-(9 ) give the number of frames per filter , the integration time ( in seconds ) , and seeing conditions ( in arcsec ) .",
    "table 2 reports some relevant information on the observed isolated galaxies obtained from the literature .",
    "column ( 1 ) is the cig catalogue number , column ( 2 ) reports other identifications , column ( 3 ) the apparent total @xmath28 magnitude from the lyon extragalactic database ( leda ) , column ( 4 ) the hubble type from leda , column ( 5 ) the apparent total @xmath28 magnitude from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , column ( 6 ) the radial velocity in km s@xmath25 corrected for virgocentric infall from leda .",
    "images were debiased , trimmed , and flat - fielded using standard iraf procedures .",
    "first , the bias level of the ccd was subtracted from all exposures .",
    "a run of 10 bias images was obtained per night , and those were combined into a single bias frame which was then applied to the object frames .",
    "the images were flat - fielded using sky flats taken in each filter at the beginning and/or end of each night .",
    "photometric calibration was achieved by nightly observations of standard stars of known magnitudes from the  pg0231 + 051  field of stars ( landolt 1992 ) with a color range @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "once the principal extinction coefficients in @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath32 were estimated , transformations of the instrumental magnitudes to a standard system were calculated according to the following equations : @xmath33 where @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath32 are the standard magnitudes , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the instrumental ( and airmass - corrected ) magnitudes , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the transformation coefficients for each filter .    a constant value associated to the sky background was subtracted using an interactive procedure that allows the user to select regions on the frame free of galaxies and bright stars .",
    "errors in determining the sky background , are , in fact , the dominant source of errors in the estimation of total magnitudes .",
    "the most energetic cosmic - ray events were automatically masked using the cosmicrays task , and field stars were removed using the imedit task when necessary . within the galaxy itself ,",
    "care was taken to identify superposed stars . a final step in the basic reduction involved registration of all available frames for each galaxy and in each filter to within @xmath40 pixel .",
    "this step was performed by measuring centroids for foreground stars on the images and then performing geometric transformations using geomap and geotran tasks in iraf .",
    "apparent magnitudes for each galaxy were estimated in three concentric circular apertures .",
    "this was achieved in @xmath0 bands by using the phot routines in iraf . here",
    "we report the total apparent magnitudes while in the appendix we report apparent magnitudes at two other circular apertures , also in @xmath0 bands .",
    "see table a1 .",
    "an estimation of the errors in our photometry involves two parts : ( 1 ) the procedures to obtain instrumental magnitudes and ( 2 ) the uncertainty when such instrumental magnitudes are transformed to the standard system .    for item ( 1 ) ,",
    "notice that the magnitudes produced at the output of the iraf routines ( phot ) have a small error that is internal to those procedures . since we have also applied extinction corrections to the instrumental magnitudes in this step , our estimation of the errors",
    "are mainly concerned with these corrections and the estimation of the airmass .",
    "after a least square fitting , the associated errors with the slope for each principal extinction coefficient are : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "an additional error @xmath45 from the airmass routines in iraf was also considered .    for item",
    "( 2 ) , the zero point and first order color terms are the most important to consider . after the transformation to the standard system by adopting our best ",
    "fit coefficients , the errors from the assumed relations for @xmath38 were respectively 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.02 and 0.02 in @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath32 , and 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.02 and 0.02 for @xmath39 . to estimate the total error in each band ,",
    "it is necessary to propagate the errors , after considering the corresponding transformation equations .",
    "an estimate of the sky contribution is necessary for quoting the total uncertainties .",
    "this was achieved by estimating the total magnitudes for all galaxies before and after sky subtraction .",
    "typical values @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained .",
    "total typical uncertainties are 0.1 , 0.12 , 0.12 and 0.15 in @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath32 bands , respectively .",
    "the estimated total magnitudes in this work were compared with other external estimations when available in the literature .",
    "this has been done for : 1 ) the standard stars and 2 ) the isolated spiral galaxies .      for the standard stars , a comparison of our ccd magnitudes with those reported in landolt ( 1992 ) for stars in the field of pg0231 + 051 and the dipper asterism m67 star cluster (",
    "chevallier & ilovaisky 1991 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows no significant deviations between our ccd magnitudes and those reported for the standard stars .",
    "a linear fit to this plot indicates a @xmath50 as the typical internal error for our magnitude estimations .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison of the estimated magnitudes for the isolated galaxies in @xmath28 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands versus the available total magnitudes in the nasa extragalactic database ( hereafter ned ) and aperture photometry in hyperleda databases .",

    "we find a reasonable agreement with the available values from the literature , except for a few discrepant cases shown in the figure .",
    "hyperleda reports detailed aperture photometry in the b - band for cig 80 . from a plot of the available data",

    "the corresponding magnitude for an aperture similar to ours is 11.60 mag , in complete agreement with our estimation .",
    "hyperleda does not report any aperture photometry in the b - band for cig 168 .",
    "a detailed aperture photometry in the v and i ( cousins ) bands is found instead .",

    "an extrapolation of the available v and i magnitudes to our aperture size is consistent with our photometry .",
    "this makes us confident that our b - band value is well estimated and suggests that the b - band magnitude reported in hyperleda should correspond to a smaller log ( a ) value .    in the case of cig 188 ,",
    "both hyperleda and ned databases report an homogenized magnitude from previously published data , assuming standard johnson ubvri filters .",
    "notice however that ned magnitude is 14.10 @xmath51 with a large error bar . given the absence of detailed aperture photometry and the diffuse nature of this galaxy",
    "( see corresponding images below ) , we suggest that the observed discrepancy is explained by the different aperture sizes .",
    "hyperleda reports a couple of aperture data points for cig 434 ( corresponding to log ( a ) = 1.12 and 1.3 , see gallagher and hunter 1986 ) . by assuming a linear curve of growth , an extrapolation to log ( a ) = 1.5 ( our aperture size ) yields a magnitude value consistent with our data .",
    "ned reports an homogenized magnitude from previously published data , assuming standard johnson ubvri filters .    for cig 691 , hyperleda reports a b  band magnitude of @xmath52 while ned reports a magnitude of @xmath53 which is significantly closer to our reported value . even more",
    ", the only aperture data point in hyperleda suggests that the reported value corresponds to a smaller aperture size than ours .",
    "finally , the internal accuracy of our photometry was evaluated by comparing the total magnitudes derived from individual exposures .",

    "next , we briefly review each one of the @xmath4 parameters",
    ".    _ concentration of light @xmath91.- _ the concentration index @xmath91 is defined as the ratio of the 80% to 20% curve of growth radii ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , within 1.5 times the petrosian inverted radius at r(@xmath94 ) ( @xmath95 ) normalized by a logarithm : @xmath96 ( see for more details c2003 ) .",
    "the concentration is related to the galaxy light ( or stellar mass ) distributions .",
    "_ asymmetry @xmath97.- _ the asymmetry index is the number computed when a galaxy is rotated @xmath98 from its center and then subtracted from its pre - rotated image , and the summation of the intensities of the absolute value residuals of this subtraction is compared with the original galaxy flux ( see for more details c2003 ) .",
    "this parameter is also measured within @xmath99 .",

    "the @xmath4 parameters of later types show on average more dependence ( and scatter ) with wavelength than the early types . among the @xmath4 parameters ,",
    "the clumpiness is the most sensitive to wavelength .",
    "the optical and ir emission in galaxies are dominated by different populations of stars and are subject to dust absorption at different levels .",
    "the structures that are dominated by older stellar populations are more prominent and less affected by extinction in the ir than in the optical . in the ir one",
    "observes a higher bar fraction than in the optical , as well as cases where the bulge appears more prominent , the spiral arms less flocculent and rings less prominent ( eskridge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the latter points towards an earlier  type classification from the ir images than from optical ones .",
    "the same trends mentioned above are observed for our sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "it should be remarked that , in our attempt to describe the morphology of the observed galaxies , we also have made use of the @xmath3 images from the the two micron - survey .",
    "the re  classification presented here ( see table 5 ) preserves the optically observed morphology but takes into account the nir bar morphology . in general , previous results concerning the differences in morphology as passing from optical to nir bands ( eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ) agree with the ones seen in our subsample of isolated galaxies , though the fraction of isolated galaxies for which these differences become significant is actually small in our case ( @xmath110 ) .    concerning bars in our isolated galaxies , they come into a variety of sizes , shapes and color distributions ; from apparently strong , to small ones confined to the central parts of galaxies and up to the oval - shaped bulges , suggesting a range of strengths , lengths and mass distributions . we have shown that the fraction of galaxies in our sample with clear evidence of optical / ir bars ( sb galaxies ) is 63% , while 16% more show some evidence of weak bars ( sab galaxies ) .",
    "these fractions are in agreement with estimates from larger samples of galaxies . for example , eskridge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) determined the fraction of strongly barred galaxies in the @xmath111band for a sample of 186 spirals _ from different environments _ to be 56% , while another 16% is weakly barred .",
    "for the same sample , the fraction of barred galaxies reported in the optical is almost a factor of two smaller than in the nir .",
    "we do not find such a strong difference with the passband in our sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "we also reported the presence of inner ( r ) and outer ( r ) rings when possible , but a detailed ring morphology ( buta 1986 ; 1995 ) was not attempted .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with rings in our sample is high , 55% .",
    "notice that the observed fraction of bars and rings in the present paper can hardly be a bias of our observing procedure since we simply selected objects according to their availability in the sky .",
    "the high fractions of bars for the isolated galaxies found here , similar to the fractions observed in other environments , could be suggesting that interactions and the global effects of the group / cluster environment are not crucial for the formation / destruction of bars .",
    "how do bars form in isolated environments ?",
    "it is known that the presence and evolution of bars in a hubble time depends on the host galaxy structure , the dark matter halo structure , the disk - to - halo ratio , as well as on the environment ( e.g. , athanassoula 2003 ; berentzen , shlosman & jogee 2006 ; coln et al .",
    "resolution n - body simulations of isolated disks embedded in cdm halos show that extended strong bars form almost always , but they slow down as a result of angular momentum transport to the disk and halo ( debattista & sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; valenzuela & klypin 2003 ) ; eventually , the bars may dissolve forming a pseudobulge ( e.g. , avila - reese et al .",
    "2005 ; berentzen et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the isolated environment may be ensuring the presence of dynamically cold disks that can form a variety of stellar bars .",
    "the observed bar fraction could also be a consequence of long  lived bars , or alternatively , of bars that recurrently form , self ",
    "destroy , and resurrect due to gas accretion ( bournaud & combes 2002 ) .",
    "constant gas accretion is a condition more viable in isolated environments than in group / clusters .",
    "our data reveal no difference in the relative bar fraction of early ( sasb ) and late ( sbcsm ) type galaxies .",
    "if any , among the barred galaxies , the late  type subsample contains a larger fraction of weakly barred ( sab ) galaxies than the early  type subsample .",
    "eskridge et al . ( 2000 ) also found that the fraction of barred galaxies almost does not depend on morphological type .",
    "it seems that rather than the fractions , the properties of the bars ( length , strength , surface brightness profile , etc . )",
    "are those that change as a function of the morphology and/or environment ( e.g. , erwin 2005 and references therein ) . for our sample",
    ", we have estimated the bar deprojected maximum ellipticity , @xmath86 .",
    "we do not find significant differences in @xmath86 as a function of morphological type as well as a function of the @xmath4 parameters .",
    "further analysis is necessary to infer the disk and bar properties and compare them with model predictions .",
    "another relevant topic is that of ring formation in isolated environments .",
    "rings of sf are a common phenomenon in disk galaxies .",
    "most rings form by gas accumulation at resonances , usually under the continuous action of gravity torques from a bar pattern , but sometimes in response to a mild tidal interaction with a nearby companion ( buta & combes 1996 ; buta 1999 ) . in either case",
    "a resonance is a very special place in a galaxy where sf can be enhanced and may proceed either as a starburst or continuously over a period of time .",
    "most of the observed rings in our galaxies are of the type encircling the end of the bars and elongated along the bar s position angle .",
    "singular cases of outer rings , inner rings and a probable circumnuclear ring were detected .",
    "contrary to bars , most of the observed rings in these isolated galaxies show bluer color distributions suggesting that their stellar populations are more similar to those in their hosting disks than those in the bars .",
    "however , some of our composed @xmath3 images also show the prevalence of the rings in the nir . the existence of this old population rings underlying star forming rings suggest a strong coupling between the stellar and gaseous components in the resonance regions .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that in any of the 44 isolated galaxies studied here , we did not find strong signatures of interactions or perturbations .",
    "however , in two cases ( cig1 and cig80 ) moderate morphological distortions can be seen , which could evidence some level of dynamical disturbance , though , these distortions could hardly be produced by strong interactions , as is the case of the isolated disturbed galaxies reported in karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2006 , see introduction ) .",
    "satellite accretion could explain the distortions seen in cig1 and cig80 .",
    "on the other hand , as mentioned above , bars and rings are axi",
    " symmetric structures that can be explained as a product of the internal secular evolution of disks . interactions and perturbations may induce and amplify bar / ring formation but can also contribute to their fast dissolution .",
    "a larger sample is necessary in order to explore whether or not a fraction of isolated galaxies shows evident signatures of interaction , a question of relevance as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "light concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness @xmath4 parameters have been used in alternative galaxy classification schemes ( see for references  5 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 parameters allow also the possibility to classify galaxies according to their interaction state ( c2003 ; hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "2005,2006 ) , which is useful in high  redshift studies . in this sense , it is important to have a well studied comparative sample of local isolated galaxies . in spite of the small number of galaxies in our current sample , we will introduce below an indicative discussion of the measured @xmath4 parameters in different color bands and of their trends with other galaxy properties .",
    "figure [ casplanes ] shows the loci of the isolated sasb and sbcsm galaxies in the projected planes of the @xmath7band @xmath4 space .",
    "only the averages and their standard deviations are shown ( crosses and continuous error bars ) .",
    "the boxes indicate the amplitude of variation of the @xmath4 parameters ( lower and upper limits ) from @xmath112 , @xmath109 to @xmath68 bands . for comparison , the @xmath7band averages and standard deviations of galaxies in interacting s+s pairs ( hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) , and starburst and ultra luminous infrared ( ulir ) galaxies ( c2003 ) are also plotted .",
    "visually , the major difference between isolated spirals and interacting , starburst and ulir spirals takes place in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "the quantitative measure of @xmath91 in our isolated spirals span the range @xmath113 , in agreement with other works .",
    "the average and standard deviation values are @xmath114 .",
    "it is known that for lenticular and elliptical galaxies , the concentrations are typically larger than for spirals ( e.g. , c2003 ; hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "we have also found that @xmath91 systematically increases with the passband for almost each one of the isolated galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ cumdistr ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with previous finds that the scalelength of spirals is smaller in nir bands than in the optical ones ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ) , which is probably pointing out probably to an inside  out galaxy formation scenario : bluer colors trace younger stellar populations , and if the disk is more extended in the optical than in the nir , then the outer disk might be younger ( more recently assembled ) than inner regions .",
    "metallicity gradients would emulate such an effect , but it seems that this is not the case ( de jong 1996 ) .    according to our current understanding of galaxy formation , disks form generically inside  out within growing cdm halos ( see for a recent review avila ",
    "reese 2006 ) .",
    "their concentrations ( or surface brightnesses ) depend mainly on the spin parameter of the halo .",
    "cdm halos span a wide lognormal distribution of the spin parameter , hence , one expects also a wide range of concentrations for the disks .",
    "probably , the observed distribution of concentrations for isolated disk galaxies is not as wide as we would expect from theory .",
    "it should be also taken into account that internal secular processes after disk formation rearrange the mass ( light ) distribution , and that the presence of a large bulge in early  type spirals tends to increase their @xmath91 parameter with respect to galaxies with smaller bulges",
    ". a fair comparison of concentrations observed in isolated spirals with model predictions is certainly a promising avenue of research . in the cases of ellipticals ( and",
    "probably the bulges of early  type galaxies ) , theory suggests that they are more concentrated due to the violent and dissipative processes that are at the basis of their formation : major mergers of gaseous disks .",
    "concentration of light has been shown to correlate with properties of galaxies like hubble type , color , and surface brightness ( okamura et al .",
    "1984 ; c2003 ; see below ) .",
    "more recent studies have also shown that concentration of light correlates with internal scaling properties such as velocity dispersion , size , luminosity , and black hole mass ( graham et al . 2001 ) .",
    "concerning asymmetry , the method used here gives a simple quantitative measure of how a galaxy deviates from axi  symmetry .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath97 has been shown to be sensitive mainly to galaxy interactions / mergers , but also is influenced by sf clumps , dust lanes , and projection effects .",
    "the quantitative measure of @xmath97 in the present sample of isolated galaxies spans roughly the range @xmath115 , the average and standard deviation being @xmath116 .",
    "the later types are slightly more asymmetric on average than the earlier ones .",
    "the asymmetries reported here are definitively lower than the typical ones of interacting disk galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ casplanes ] ) .",
    "the @xmath97 parameter decreases significantly as the passband is redder ( fig .",
    "[ cumdistr ] ) . for interacting spirals ,",
    "the same trend was observed , but in a much less extent ( hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "this suggests that while the ( high ) asymmetry in interacting spirals is mainly of global / external origin hence is more or less the same in different bands , in the case of isolated spirals the ( low ) asymmetry is in part related to sf effects ; this is why @xmath97 is so sensitive to the passband in which it is measured . the question of whether a disk of a spiral galaxy is intrinsically asymmetric or not is of great interest .",
    "some studies have shown that important deviations from axisymmetry exist in the optical and other wavelengths ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; richter & sancisi 1994 ; c2003 ) . however , systematic attempts to quantify asymmetry and other measures like the @xmath4 parameters in several wavelengths for well  selected local samples of galaxies are either rare or missing in the literature .",
    "galaxies undergoing sf are patchy , specially in the bluer bands , and an important fraction of light must be in high spatial frequency structures .",
    "this is quantified through the clumpiness @xmath100 parameter . for our sample of isolated galaxies ,",
    "@xmath117 ranges roughly from @xmath118 to @xmath119 , being the average and standard deviation values @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath100 parameter is on average larger and more scattered in later types than in the earlier ones as is seen in fig .",
    "[ casplanes ] ( see also below ) .",
    "it is well known indeed that late type galaxies present more current sf activity than the early type ones .",
    "although , the parameter @xmath100 in our isolated galaxies is typically smaller than in interacting spirals , the differences are actually small , ant not so significant as in the case of the asymmetry parameter ( fig .",
    "[ casplanes ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the increase of the @xmath100 value as the passband is bluer in our isolated galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ cumdistr ] ) is much more significant than in the case of interacting galaxies ( hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we next explore how the @xmath4 parameters of isolated galaxies correlate with other properties and whether these correlations are sensitive to the passband or not .",
    "figures [ cas_t ] and [ cas_color ] show the @xmath28 , @xmath1 , @xmath109 and @xmath68 band @xmath4 parameters vs morphological type @xmath121 and corrected total @xmath8 color .",
    "nearly edge  on galaxies ( inclination @xmath122 ) are plotted with ( open ) circles .",
    "given that @xmath97 and @xmath100 are particularly sensitive to projection effects , it is important to visualize these galaxies since they may be masking any trend .    after a visual inspection of figs .",
    "[ cas_t ] and [ cas_color ] , the general conclusion is that any potential trend of the @xmath4 parameters with @xmath121 and total @xmath8 color tends typically to be more robust in the redder bands .",
    "this emphasizes the merits of ir parameters , which are less contaminated from ( transient ) sf effects and better represent the basic structure of galaxies .",
    "we should note that the scatters in these trends , even for the @xmath123 band , are large .",
    "the images from the two  micron survey are unfortunately of low quality , specially in the @xmath77band . besides , for several of our galaxies , there are not images in this survey .",
    "therefore , the @xmath109 and @xmath68 band data discussed here should be taken only as indicative ones .",
    "larger samples are needed in order to quantify better the showed dependences in figs .",
    "[ cas_t ] and [ cas_color ] , and infer from them clues to the physics of disk galaxies . notwithstanding this",
    ", we present below a brief discussions on the observed trends .    according to figs .",
    "[ cas_t ] and [ cas_color ] , while the concentration tends to be higher for earlier  type and redder galaxies , the asymmetry and clumpiness tend to become smaller .",
    "the morphological type is led mainly by the bulge  to  disk ratio .",
    "the global color is also affected by this ratio .",
    "therefore , it is expected that earlier types be more concentrated and redder",
    ". however , the @xmath91 parameter and the global color are not too sensitive to the bulge  to  disk ratio for galaxies with intermediate - to - small values of this ratio ( say sb types and latter ) ; therefore , in these cases , the measured @xmath91 and global color reflect mostly the pure disk concentration and color .",
    "thus , that @xmath91 depends on @xmath121 for late types , implies mainly a connection between the spiral arm properties and the disk concentration .",
    "the dependence of @xmath91 on color would imply mainly that less concentrated disks have a more constant sf history , probably because their gas surface densities are low .",
    "concerning asymmetry , the observed dependence on @xmath121 indicates that most of the asymmetry of our isolated spirals is associated with the natural flocculency in later - type galaxies as well with sf , which is more active for later types ( as is evidenced also by the trend of higher @xmath100 values as the types are later and the colors bluer , see above ) . in this interpretation , the effect of large  scale perturbations ( c.f .",
    "interactions ) is neglected .",
    "the @xmath97 parameter could be used as a first  approximation indicator of interaction signatures in isolated spirals .",
    "an automatic analysis of images in large samples of galaxies provides easily the @xmath97 parameter .",
    "an even more reliable test for interactions would be to produce the loci of the studied isolated spirals in the @xmath6 diagram , where maximum differences between isolated and interacting galaxies are revealed as was seen above ( fig [ cas_t ] ; see also hernndez  toledo et al .",
    "the adding of color information is also valuable as evidenced by fig [ cas_color ] .",
    "we present results of our @xmath0 ccd photometry for a set of 44 isolated galaxies selected from the cig catalogue ( karachentseva 1973 ) .",
    "we have shown that our derived parameters are generally in good agreement with the aperture photometry reported in the hyperleda database and other individual photometric works .",

    "a morphological re  classification of the galaxies has been presented with emphasis on structural features as bars and rings and global disturbances .",

    "the average and standard deviation values of the @xmath85band deprojected maximum ellipticity of the bars , @xmath86 , is @xmath87 .",
    "there is not any trend of @xmath86 with the morphological type and the @xmath4 parameters .",
    "we have also found that 55% of the isolated galaxies in our sample shows ring structures .    finally , we have calculated the @xmath0 , @xmath109 and @xmath77 band concentration , asymmetry , and clumpiness ( @xmath4 ) parameters for the sample .",

    "<S> the structural @xmath4 parameters change with the observed band , and the tendencies they follow with the morphological type and global color are more evident in the redder bands . in any band , the major difference between our isolated spirals and a sample of interacting spirals is revealed in the @xmath6 plane . </S>",
    "<S> a deep and uniformly observed sample of isolated galaxies is intended for various purposes including ( i ) comparative studies of environmental effects , ( ii ) confronting model predictions of galaxy evolution and ( iii ) evaluating the change of galaxy properties with redshift . </S>"
