    "a variety of phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology is modelled by stochastic differential ( or difference ) equations @xcite which involve both additive and multiplicative noise .",
    "the additive noise is relatively easy to handle with the help of the central limit theorem .",
    "this type of noise disappears from the noise - averaged form of the equations .",
    "the situation changes dramatically with the appearance of multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "some situations have been documented in the literature , in which the multiplicative noise participates in the creation of a pure _ noise - induced phase transition _ @xcite .",
    "in such a case fundamental theorems of an importance comparable to the central limit theorem are still lacking . in this paper",
    "we will investigate another famous example of this phenomenon - the anderson localization as a noise - induced metal - insulator phase transition .",
    "let us consider spatially extended systems with multiplicative noise .",
    "anderson localization @xcite has remained a hot topic in the physics of disordered systems for a long time ( see review articles @xcite ) and constitutes a multidisciplinary problem . formally",
    "the schrdinger equation with random on - site potentials in the tight - binding representation is a stochastic algebraic equation with multiplicative noise , where physical meaning can only be attributed to certain average values ( averaging over the ensemble of random potentials @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is very similar to statistical physics , especially to the statistical physics of phase transitions ( quantum phase transitions , see @xcite ) , because there also a noise - induced metal - insulator phase transition is analyzed ( keywords : critical dimension , correlation length , etc . ) . in the case of phase transitions",
    "one finds that the relevant parameters ( in our case e.g. lyapunov exponents or localization lengths ) are not analytical functions of the disorder .",
    "typically the theoretical analysis of disordered systems is based either on approximations or on numerical methods @xcite . however , it is clear that this can not be sufficient for systems revealing a _ phase transition _",
    "@xcite , e.g. a metal - insulator transition as is the case with anderson localization . in such a case an exact solution is greatly needed .",
    "disordered systems are usually considered as a part of solid state physics ( or statistical physics ) .",
    "the theoretical methods here are very different from the ones in the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "it is known that static randomness ( multiplicative noise in space ) in the physics of disordered systems may drastically change macroscopic quantities .",
    "such an effect exists also for dynamical systems with randomness in the equations of motion ( multiplicative noise in time ) .",
    "for example , in special cases the random walk problem is mapped to a quantum mechanical tight - binding model exhibiting anderson localization @xcite",
    ". it might be reasonable to start from a simple microscopic stochastic kinematic model ( brownian motion and normal diffusion ) , and to build the theory of anderson localization along this line ( tight - binding model and generalized diffusion @xcite , with a noise - induced metal - insulator phase transition ) .    in our papers @xcite we presented somewhat schematically and by leaving out many mathematical details an exact analytic solution of the anderson localization problem .",
    "subsequently there were critical comments @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that our proof is too short and condensed , and more details are needed , the more so , since the mathematical formalism used by us is quite new for this scientific community of anderson localization .",
    "this is why we present in the present paper the detailed derivation of the analytical solution with illustrations .",
    "note that under the exact solution we mean the calculation of the phase diagram for the metal - insulator system @xcite .",
    "we do not calculate transport and other important properties .",
    "however , the knowledge of the phase diagram permits to understand , how these properties can be calculated .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain how the localized states can be treated in terms of a",
    "_ generalized diffusion_. this approach allows to understand why for defining the phase diagram it is sufficient to solve exactly only equations for the _",
    "joint correlators_. we present and solve here the equations for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "section 3 deals with the _ stability _ of this solution .",
    "it is shown that the generalized diffusion arises due to the divergence of the _",
    "fundamental mode_. the determination of the stability range of this mode permits us to calculate the _ phase diagram_. we explain our language of _ input and output signals , filter function _ which is new for the anderson localization community .",
    "strictly speaking , the disordered anderson tight - binding model @xcite with schrdinger equation @xmath3 where the summation over @xmath4 runs over the nearest neighbours of site @xmath5 , can not be solved exactly for arbitrary dimension d. the reason is that the random potential @xmath6 enters the equation as a product with the random amplitude @xmath7 which corresponds to the multiplicative noise case @xcite . therefore , the _ exact solution _ of eq .",
    "( [ tight - binding ] ) discussed in @xcite is possible only under special circumstances to be discussed below .    the fundamental quantity of a disordered system - the localization length @xmath8 - was determined in @xcite via the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 .",
    "in these calculations the following conditions which appear contradictory at first sight have to be satisfied .",
    "the phase diagram of the system with metal - insulator transition should be obtained in the _ thermodynamical limit _",
    "@xcite ( the infinite system ) .",
    "however , the determination of the lyapunov exponent needs the introduction of a coordinate system ( starting point ) which imposes certain limitations on the system size .",
    "moreover , a direction for the growth of the divergent quantity should be chosen , despite the fact that all space directions are equivalent in eq .",
    "( [ tight - binding ] ) .",
    "all these conditions are fulfilled for the _ semi - infinite _ system , or system with a boundary , where the index @xmath9 , but all @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the boundary which is the layer @xmath13 defines the preferential direction ( the axis @xmath14 ) along which the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 will be calculated .",
    "it is convenient to interpret the index @xmath15 as the _ discrete - time _",
    ", whereas all other indices combine in the vector @xmath16 .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ tight - binding ] ) can be rewritten as a _ recursion equation _ ( in terms of the discrete - time , and assuming summation over repeated indices ) @xmath17 where the operator @xmath18 is introduced for compactness ( summation over @xmath19 includes the nearest neighbours of the site @xmath20 ) . the discrete - time equation ( [ recursion dn ] )",
    "is a difference equation of the second order , which needs two initial conditions ( cauchy problem for the difference equation ) .",
    "the first natural condition is @xmath21 .",
    "the second initial condition can be presented in the general form @xmath22 without any additional conditions for the arbitrary constants @xmath23 , except that they are supposed to be finite .",
    "the rules for the treatment of the field @xmath23 will be explained below , section [ alpha ] .",
    "the recursion equation ( [ recursion dn ] ) reveals a general feature of the _ causality _ - in its formal solution @xmath24 depends only on the random variables @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "this gives us a hint for the _ exact solution _ of the equation provided that random variables @xmath6 on different sites _ do not correlate _ : @xmath27 . in this case",
    "all amplitudes @xmath28 on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ recursion dn ] ) are statistically independent of @xmath29 . in other words , while performing the mathematical operations in eq .",
    "( [ recursion dn ] ) , e.g. _ taking the square _ of both equation sides , with a further averaging over an ensemble of different realizations of the random potentials ( symbol @xmath30 ) , the average of the product of amplitudes @xmath28 and potentials @xmath29 can be replaced by a product of the corresponding average quantities . therefore , the exact solution can be obtained only when the on - site potentials @xmath31 are _ independently and identically _ distributed .",
    "we assume hereafter existence of the two first moments , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the parameter @xmath34 characterizes the _ disorder level_.      the ensemble averaging using recursion eq.([recursion dn ] ) allows us to calculate averages of different functions containing the amplitudes @xmath28 .",
    "the problem arises , _ which _ averages we can and should calculate ?",
    "e.g. several even moments of the amplitude were calculated in the 1-d case @xcite , whereas only the second momentum was calculated for multidimensional systems in @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the _ complete information _ is available from the complete set of _ all _ moments @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear , how this information should be analyzed . in particular",
    ", how can the _ one _ parameter of our interest - the localization length @xmath8 - be extracted from the _ infinite _ set of amplitude momenta ?    it was suggested in @xcite to calculate not only the second , @xmath35 , and other momenta , but also _ physical values _",
    ", such as @xmath36 .",
    "the average quantities are divided in @xcite into two categories : containing physical information ( e.g. @xmath37 ) and containing no physical information ( e.g. @xmath38 ) .    in other words",
    ", one has to understand how the choice of a semi - infinite system with a selected direction ( @xmath14 axis ) and the boundary ( layers in the transversal directions with @xmath39 ) allows us to detect the localized states under question .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a 1-d system , where the amplitude @xmath40 and the second initial condition @xmath41 .",
    "again , for _ simplicity _ let us consider @xmath42 to be a real quantity , i.e. @xmath43 . the recursive equation reads : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider now the random walk problem ( brownian motion @xcite for the coordinate @xmath47 ) which is described by the following equations @xmath48 there exists a mean squared displacement @xmath49 of the brownian particle during a step .",
    "considering @xmath14 as the discrete - time index , both eqs .",
    "( [ recursion1 ] ) and ( [ recursion2 ] ) describe the dynamics of the system with a stochastic time - dependent perturbation @xmath50 .",
    "the only difference is that the dynamics of the system ( [ recursion2 ] ) is trivial : @xmath51 when there is no perturbation , @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast , the dynamical system ( [ recursion1 ] ) even for @xmath52 reveals proper dynamics ( it is a second order equation ! ) . in the band region , @xmath53 , this corresponds to the bounded motion .",
    "therefore , the proper dynamics of both systems corresponds to the _ bounded _ trajectories , @xmath54 .",
    "assuming now that @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ recursion2 ] ) describes the _",
    "normal diffusion_. the diffusion motion is characterized by _ divergences _",
    ", e.g. for the mean time when the system returns to the initial state .",
    "in particular , the momenta of the amplitude @xmath47 are also divergent with the discrete - time @xmath14 , e.g. @xmath56 reveals a _ power law _ divergence . for normal diffusion",
    "the mean square displacement @xmath57 of the brownian particles is linear in time .    to detect the diffusion ,",
    "it is _ sufficient _ to demonstrate the divergence of the _ second moment _ of the amplitude and to establish its _ law of time - dependence _ @xcite .",
    "for example , for _ anomalous diffusion _ the mean quare displacement @xmath58 of the particles is no longer linear in time , but follows a generalized fick s second law @xcite .    generally speaking ,",
    "other moments contain additional information , which , however , is not important .",
    "the divergence of the second moment defines the conditions of the diffusion appearance : _ if _ the second moment is divergent , so are _ all other even moments _",
    "( this is why the choice of a particular moment for further analysis is _ not unique _ ) .",
    "the _ law _ of the divergence of the time - dependence allows us to distinguish between normal and abnormal diffusion .",
    "important is the fact that the second moment @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ recursion2 ] ) can be found exactly analytically and thus we prefer its use ( @xmath60-definition ) .",
    "speaking formally , the diffusion could also be classified using other averaged quantities , e.g. @xmath61 , but such a choice is not convenient for mathematical reasons ; it hinders an analytical solution .    as is well - known , in a 1-d system described by eq .",
    "( [ recursion1 ] ) any disorder @xmath55 leads to localization .",
    "this manifests itself in the simultaneous divergence , as @xmath62 , of different average quantities of @xmath63 , e.g. the _ linear _ divergence of @xmath64 ( log - definition of localization ) , whereas the _ exponential _ divergence occurs for the powers of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the localization in the approach based on eq .",
    "( [ recursion1 ] ) is equivalent to the appearance of diffusion . in eq .",
    "( [ recursion2 ] ) the random perturbation @xmath50 is _ additive _ , which determines the _ linear _ ( power - law ) character of the second moment divergence ( normal diffusion ) .",
    "in contrast , eq .",
    "( [ recursion1 ] ) contains the _ product _ of @xmath50 and @xmath47 ( _ multiplicative noise _ ) which determines the _ exponential _ character of the divergence ( see also brownian motion @xcite and normal nonlinear diffusion @xcite with multiplicative noise ) .",
    "i.e. , we can speak of the _ generalized diffusion _ , analyzing the @xmath65 divergence as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the exponential localization here corresponds to the exponential growth of @xmath66 , fig .",
    "[ fig : 2 ] , where @xmath1 can be interpreted as the _ localization length _ ( @xmath60 - localization definition @xcite ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the numerical solution for the amplitude @xmath47 are plotted here using eq.([recursion1 ] ) together with arbitrary realizations of perturbations @xmath50 ( two upper windows ) . on the other hand , the lower window of fig.[fig :",
    "2 ] show the exact analytical solution for the second momenta @xmath59 ( eqs.([s1d ] ) and ( [ z0 ] ) of this paper ) .",
    "the analysis of these results ( as well as other data for different @xmath67 and @xmath34 ) demonstrates that purely exponential behaviour , @xmath68 , is valid only asymptotically , as @xmath62 . in other words , the exponential behaviour of divergence",
    "is understood by its definition , eq.([gamma2 ] ) .",
    "there is a transient regime for finite @xmath14 values especially for small @xmath0 ( as shown in fig.[fig : 2 ] ) where the exponential behaviour is combined with the oscillations corresponding to the proper dynamics , eq.([recursion2 ] ) .",
    "note that the bounded proper motion of @xmath47 for @xmath52 in the band region , @xmath53 , corresponds to oscillating functions .",
    "the @xmath60-definition is convenient not only because the equations for the second moment can be exactly solved ( see below ) .",
    "it is important that this definition works also for the non - exponential localization , which corresponds to the non - exponential behaviour of @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast , the traditional log - definition is valid only for the exponential localization , and does not allow an exact analytical solution .",
    "it was analytically shown @xcite for 1-d systems that if the higher moments of the random potential @xmath50 can be neglected ( for @xmath70 ) and we can restrict ourselves to the only parameter @xmath34 , the exponents in _ all _ even moments ( as well as in log - definition ) are proportional to each other , they differ only by numerical factors .",
    "the proportionality of the different exponents ( lyapunov exponents ) in the exponential growth indicates that different definitions of the generalized diffusion are in fact _ identical _ and one can use any of them , e.g the @xmath60-definition .    note that the emergence of the generalized diffusion phenomenon and the existence of the phase diagrams in dynamical systems with the proper dynamics are analogous to _ critical phenomena _ in equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems . in this sense , it is clear that use of the @xmath60-definition for the determination of the phase - diagram is quite sufficient .",
    "exactly solvable problems in the physics of phase transitions @xcite , e.g. the ising model , have demonstrated that in spite of the fact that the physical quantities , i.e. long range order parameter , magnetic susceptibility , specific heat , etc .",
    "are defined as _",
    "different averages _ , they still behave _ similarly _ , when only the phase - diagram is considered .",
    "this is not surprising since one deals here with averages obtained for the _ same statistical ensemble_. in particular , the critical temperature obtained for the order parameter coincides with that obtained for the susceptibility .",
    "this occurs for the _ exact _ solutions , although deviations can arise for the approximate solutions .",
    "similarly , the phase diagram for the system with a metal - insulator transition can be defined uniquely if one determines any non - trivial average quantity .",
    "this is why the choice of @xmath37 is not convenient .",
    "a product of a sum of variables can be represented as a polynomial , where each term can be calculated , whereas the logarithm of a sum can not be represented this way and thus the causality principle can not be used . on the other hand ,",
    "the averages of the powers of the amplitude can be calculated exactly .",
    "when we speak of the phase - diagram , we mean determination of the boundaries of metallic and insulating phases . in this respect ,",
    "the results @xcite demonstrate that the second order moments form a _ closed and linear _ set of equations and , where the only characteristic of the random potentials is the second momentum , @xmath71 , have a simple interpretation .",
    "the phase boundaries are defined by the only simple parameter @xmath34 of the random potential .",
    "that is , calculation of second moments ( _ correlators _ ) is the _ direct way _ to obtaining the phase diagram .      in general , the field @xmath23 is complex .",

    "the transition from @xmath110 matrices to @xmath108-order matrices was interpreted as an error arising due to _ averaging over initial conditions _ @xcite and thus artificially introducing a translation in the transversal directions .",

    "all these states are described by wave functions bounded in amplitude , which corresponds to a bounded 1-d input signal @xmath133 . in a disordered system",
    "this signal transforms into @xmath154 , according to eq .",
    "( [ inverse4 ] ) .",
    "this output signal @xmath154 can be either bounded , or infinitely growing ( generalized diffusion ) .",
    "the natural interpretation of _ bounded output signals _ is that they - as before - correspond to the _ delocalized states _ bounded in amplitude .",
    "the _ unbounded output signals _ correspond to the _ localized states _ , respectively , which lead in the semi - infinite system to the divergence of the diagonal correlators .",
    "an important result of signal theory @xcite is that the divergence does not result from properties of a particular bounded input signal ; the cause lies in the filter , @xmath2 or @xmath155 .",
    "we define the phase diagram of the anderson model based on a general concept of the signal theory known as a _ bibo stability _",
    "namely , a system is bibo stable if every * * b**ounded * * i**nput leads to a * * b**ounded * * o**utput . a stable system ( delocalized states )",
    "is characterized by a _ stable _ filter @xmath2 ; its main property is the _ absence of poles _ in the complex @xmath119-plane outside the circle @xmath156 .",
    "unstable _ system ( localized states ) is characterized by the _ unstable _",
    "filter @xmath2 _ with poles _ outside the circle @xmath156 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , in the anderson model the pole @xmath157 of the unstable filter lies on the real axis .",

    ", one can easily find that asymptotically @xmath159 , i.e. it is divergent .",
    "the localization length is defined as @xmath160 .",
    "the mathematical formalism of the signal theory allows to extend and complement this result for the energy range @xmath161 , where in the absence of disorder there existed only mathematical ( divergent ) solutions having no physical interpretation .",
    "it is known that disorder extends the band , i.e. new physical states arise also at @xmath161 . the question is : can delocalized states exist amongst these new states ?",
    "the answer is simple . in the region",
    "@xmath161 only _ unbounded input signals _ @xmath133 exist .",
    "such a signal can not be transformed into a _ bounded output signal _ @xmath154 .",
    "the output signal @xmath154 is always unbounded with a dual interpretation : on the one hand it corresponds to mathematical solutions ( no physical interpretation ) ; on the other hand , the divergence of the output signal can be associated with an emergence of the localized states .",
    "i.e. , an emergence of delocalized states in the region @xmath161 ( outside the band ) is impossible @xcite .",
    "use of the filter function @xmath2 is a general and abstract method for describing the metal - insulator transition , valid for any space dimension .",
    "earlier @xcite we used a less fundamental approach for the 1-d problem , based on the calculation of the lyapunov exponent for the @xmath60-definition @xmath162 where for the 1-d case @xmath163 . taking into account that the divergence of the output signal @xmath164 is caused by the divergence of the filter @xmath155 , one can use also the following equation @xmath165 in the 1-d case both definitions of @xmath0 are equivalent , since for a fixed energy and disorder , for a second initial condition @xmath41 , one gets the _ single _ output signal @xmath164 .",

    "indeed , simultaneous divergence of the output signal @xmath164 and the filter @xmath155 arises due to the fact that the asymptotic behaviour of both quantities is determined by the same parameter , @xmath169 .    however , this equivalence is no longer valid for a space dimension higher than one .",
    "since the second initial condition is defined by the field @xmath23 , this corresponds to a continuum of input signals @xmath170 and , respectively , a continuum of output signals @xmath164 .",
    "that is , the definition ( [ gamma2 ] ) is not valid , since it is not clear that different signals should correspond to the same lyapunov exponent @xmath0 . formally , a whole continuum of solutions should be analyzed .",
    "however , eq.([inverse4 ] ) demonstrates that the fundamental lyapunov exponent @xmath0 does _ not depend _ at all on the field @xmath23 , it is sufficient to define the lyapunov exponent using only eq.([gamma3 ] ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis @xcite reveals another problem of the definition ( [ gamma2 ] ) : this is valid _ only _ in the 1-d case where for any disorder @xmath34 only the phase of the localized solutions exists .    as it was mentioned above , for the calculation of the fundamental filter @xmath155 using the inverse z - transform , eq.([inverse3 ] ) , the contour integration over the so - called _ region of convergence _ ( roc ) @xcite is necessary , provided the filter under consideration is causal .",
    "it is shown @xcite that dependent on the energy @xmath67 and disorder @xmath34 , two general cases are possible for the anderson model with @xmath171 .",
    "in the first case , the roc lies _ outside _ the circle @xmath156 .",
    "the filter @xmath155 is thus _ unstable _ and describes the localized states ( insulating phase ) . in the second case ,",
    "the roc consists of _ two domains _ in the complex plane : one domain is _ inside _ the circle @xmath172 , another one - _ outside _ this circle , @xmath156 . respectively",
    ", there are _ two ways _ to calculate the integral using eq .",
    "( [ inverse3 ] ) .",
    "the double solution arises , one describing delocalized states ( filter @xmath173 , metallic phase ) , the other localized states ( filter @xmath174 , insulating phase ) .",
    "consequently , in this range of parameters @xmath67 and @xmath34 the _ two phases _ can co - exist , this is why the metal - insulator transition in the anderson model has to be analyzed in terms of _ first - order _ phase transition theory @xcite .",
    "it is known that complex ( first or higher order ) phase transitions introduced purely by noise can be generated for spatially extended systems @xcite . for arbitrary random potentials",
    "the wave function can be _ either _ localized _ or",
    "_ delocalized ( no co - existence ! ) . however , in terms of _ statistics _ of an ensemble of random potentials , _ both _ localized _ and _",
    "delocalized solutions can arise with a _",
    "comparable probability_. namely this comparability of probabilities is the main characteristic of the first - order phase transition , in contrast to the second - order transitions where either a pure metallic phase ( no localized states ) or a pure insulating phase ( no delocalized states ) should exist : co - existence is impossible .    for the illustration",
    "let us discuss here the phase diagram in terms of energy @xmath67 and disorder @xmath34 for 2-d case as shown in fig.[fig :",
    "3 ] ( the band region @xmath175 ) .",
    "the other dimensions are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the diagram in fig.[fig : 3 ] shows that all states with energies @xmath176 are localized at arbitrarily weak disorder .",
    "the localization at the finite disorder parameter @xmath177 , where according to ref.@xcite @xmath178 is also observed in the energy range @xmath179 . in other words , only pure insulating phase ( no delocalized states ) takes place in these cases .",
    "the localized states are observed also in the rest of the phase diagram , namely , for small energies , @xmath179 , and small disorder , @xmath180 .",
    "however , as it was mentioned above , the localized states could be observed only for a certain realization of the random potentials .",
    "for other realizations the delocalized states occur in the same range of energy and disorder , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "phase co - existence creates a serious problem of the choice of an adequate mathematical formalism . strictly speaking , when calculating the average quantities on the ensemble of different realizations of random potentials , the contributions from pure metallic and insulating phases are considered as equivalent . however , such _ heterophase averages _ have no physical sense @xcite . in a two - phase system with first - order phase transition one",
    "is interested in properties of _ pure phases_. from this point of view , the earlier introduced output signals @xmath164 are also heterophase averages .",
    "this is why the derivation of equations for signals is not a goal , but the tool for obtaining a more fundamental property - the filter @xmath2 ( or @xmath155 ) . as was noted @xcite , it is such a filter which reveals the _ multiplicity of solutions _ and which permits us to determine the phase diagram for the anderson model .",
    "let us discuss now the problem of _ averaging over initial conditions _",
    "this procedure was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , its meaning is quite simple .",
    "first of all , we choose a particular second initial condition , i.e. a field @xmath23 .",
    "secondly , let us consider the field @xmath183 obtained from the first field as the result of a trivial _ translation _ in transversal direction by the vector @xmath184 .",
    "it is obvious that the relevant diagonal correlators @xmath185 can also be obtained by the _ argument shift _ in a transversal direction .",
    "both solutions are _ physically equivalent_. the fourier transform of the field @xmath23 with the vector shift @xmath184 satisfies a simple relation : @xmath186 .",
    "( [ chi_k ] ) to ( [ hk ] ) clearly demonstrate that the vector shift affects only signals for particular modes @xmath96 , and all physically equivalent solutions differ from each other only by _",
    "phases _ : @xmath187 note that only the fundamental mode @xmath188 remains invariant .",
    "averaging now the signal over all translations in transversal directions ( averaging over initial conditions @xcite ) gives zero for all non - fundamental modes , @xmath122 : @xmath189 , @xmath190 .",
    "nonzero is only the fundamental mode ( @xmath191 ) : @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "the average diagonal correlator loses its dependence on the argument @xmath20 : @xmath194 .",
    "that is , averaging over initial conditions is an efficient tool for getting rid of all non - fundamental modes which are non - essential for the analysis .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ chi3 ] ) contains @xmath195 which is a function of the field @xmath23 , its fourier transform is @xmath196 .",
    "the averaging over initial conditions corresponds mathematically in the initial eq .",
    "( [ x(z ) ] ) to the replacement of the initial condition @xmath85 by the average , @xmath197 .",
    "after such a _ replacement _ of initial conditions the system becomes much simpler : it is _ translation - invariant _ in transversal directions which makes use of the double fourier transform unnecessary . in other words ,",
    "averaging over initial conditions is nothing but a simple mathematical trick which permits to get quickly the fundamental property of system - the filter @xmath2 .",
    "such tricks are based on the fact that the filters are universal system characteristics , describing the solution transformation from order to disorder .",
    "such universal characteristics are _ independent _ of the initial conditions and other details .",
    "the initial conditions determine such non - universal properties as signals .",
    "consequently , in order to obtain the fundamental filter @xmath2 and then the phase diagram , one can perform _ linear operations _ with signals , in particular , averaging over initial conditions .",
    "another example of such operations is the following .",
    "let us consider the field @xmath23 not as fixed ( second initial condition ) , but as a random variable , with simultaneous averaging _ over the field _ @xmath23 and _ over the ensemble of the random potential realizations _ @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the absence of correlations between the potentials @xmath6 and the field @xmath23 ; unlike the correlation between the field components characterized by the arbitrary correlation function @xmath198 . the initial condition in eq.([x(z ) ] ) becomes @xmath199 .",
    "taking into account that the operator @xmath200 by its definition , eq.([l ] ) , depends only on the on the argument difference , @xmath201 , one gets the translation invariant system , where @xmath202 , provided for the diagonal correlators @xmath203 holds ( the diagonal correlators are @xmath20-independent ) .    in this case in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ x(z ) ] ) , it is sufficient to use a single fourier transform @xmath204 instead of eq.([ux ] ) one gets @xmath205 which gives @xmath206 as a result , one returns to the fundamental eqs.([chi2 ] ) to ( [ h ] ) , with replacement of the @xmath207 for @xmath208 .",
    "we would like to stress that in this paper we presented a mathematically rigorous method for the calculation of the phase diagram for the anderson localization in arbitrary dimensions , which was briefly discussed earlier @xcite .",

    "localized states correspond to values of @xmath209 , i.e. a divergence of the averages over wavefunctions .",
    "this divergence is mathematically similar to the divergence of averages for the diffusion motion .",
    "that is , transition to the localized states can be treated as a generalized diffusion . from this viewpoint , in order to determine the range of the existence of localized states ( i.e. the phase diagram ) and the type of localization ( exponential or non - exponential ) , it is sufficient to solve equations for the joint correlators .",
