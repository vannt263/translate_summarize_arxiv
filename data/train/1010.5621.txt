    "the small magellanic cloud has been a hot bed for the discovery of high mass x - ray binaries ever since the initial discovery of smc x-1 @xcite .",
    "there are 56 known x - ray pulsars in the smc @xcite and more than 20 candidates discussed in the literature .",
    "these systems comprise a compact object , typically a neutron star , accreting mass from an early type companion star . in all but one smc system ( smc x-1 accretes from a supergiant )",
    "this companion is a main sequence be star , such systems are known as be / x - ray binaries .",
    "typically these systems are found to have long period , high eccentricity orbits , that are directly related to the spin period of the neutron star through the corbet diagram @xcite .",
    "the nature of such orbits leads to two types of outburst behaviour , type - i outbursts occur during periastron when the neutron star interacts with the be star s circumstellar disk , hence these outbursts are periodic and last a few days depending on the orbital eccentricity @xcite .",
    "type - ii outbursts are far longer in duration and brighter , they can appear at any orbital phase and are associated with massive disk growth allowing continued mass transfer to the neutron star .",
    "studies of these systems and outbursts have been through their emission in x - rays and optical wavelengths .",
    "the high spatial capabilities of satellites like _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ swift _ , allowed the counterparts to be identified as be stars .",
    "recent optical studies by @xcite and @xcite have produced optical classifications for the majority of the identified optical counterparts to both the pulsating and non - pulsating x - ray binaries in the smc .",
    "these studies show that the spectral class distribution is entirely consistent with that of the milky way be / x - ray binaries .    ,",
    "variations in the size of the circumstellar disk are primarily studied through h@xmath2 spectroscopy .",
    "however , the circumstellar disk also adds to the general continuum emission , this contribution is most noticeable at infrared wavelengths due to the relatively cool disk temperatures .",
    "studies of circumstellar disk temperatures have found that the disk surface temperature profile is extremely complex and highly dependent on density .",
    "the range of temperatures is found to be @xmath3k @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the ogle i band data is ideal for studying the changes that take place in be stars circumstellar disks .",
    "the ogle data primarily comprise two data sets , ogle - ii @xcite and ogle - iii @xcite , together covering the range mjd@xmath4 .",
    "the ogle data are sampled daily , but , due to the earths orbit round the sun and the location of the ogle telescope at the las campanas astronomical site in chile , the smc is only visible for approximately two thirds of the year .",
    "hence the combined ogle data ( which will be referred to as the ogle light curve ) has large periodic gaps .",

    "it is essential first to detrend the data .",
    "however , it was decided to exclude the first three years of data for the northern star because the changes were too rapid to remove satisfactorily .",

    "was calculated based on the false alarm probabiltiy ( fap ) of finding a peak above a certain power in a pure noise light curve @xcite , resulting in the significance being given by 1-fap .",
    "the related error on the detected peak is given by equation  14 in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in the 7th year of data a strong periodicity is present above the 99% significance level . the 2nd and 3rd harmonics are also identifiable , at a slightly lower level . in the analysis of the entire 4 years worth of data ,",
    "the primary peak and both harmonics have increased in strength .",
    "the periodicity is at @xmath12d with harmonics at 9.31 and 6.21d .",

    "there is no periodicity seen in any of the individual 7 years of data above the 99% significance level , and none when the light curve is taken as a whole .",
    "this indicates that the observed periodicity in the northern star is real and not an artefact due to the close proximity of the stars , or of the data extraction process .",
    "@xcite propose that the 18d period is an artefact of the timing analysis caused by the beating of the 6 and 9 day periodicities .",
    "the visual presence of the 18.62d periodicity in the 7th year of data would suggest that beating is not the cause of the power and that the variation is infact due to the orbital motion , in addition the folded light curve ( discussed later ) is typical of the optical emission from a be / x - ray binary system .    combining this period with the pulse period of 2.37s places smc x-2 on the edge of the distribution of",
    "be / x - ray binaries in the corbet diagram @xcite .",
    "if one of the 6 or 9 day periodicites suggested by @xcite were the true binary period then the source would be fall within the roche lobe overflow region ( rlof ) .",
    "rlof systems are continious accretors , hence they would be detectable in the x - ray at all times .",
    "although there is little x - ray information on this source ( see section [ sec : sxp2.37_rxte ] ) there have been sufficient observations of the region with _",
    "rxte _ to rule out the possibility that the source is a rlof system .",
    "this supports the proposal that 18.6d is the binary period @xcite and that sxp2.37 is a be / x - ray binary with the northern star as the optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sxp2.37_flc ] shows the orbital profile for smc x-2 , constructed from the portion of optical light curve used in the period search . in this paper the orbital profiles are constructed using the phase - independent folding procedure @xcite .",

    "the combined folded profile is the average of the individual folds , producing a higher resolution profile .",
