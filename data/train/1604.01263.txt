    "the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and density are subject to the intense investigations by lattice and analytic methods @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite turned out to be effective and perspective analytical tool for the generalization of qcd to non - zero temperature and density . in the absence of external sources",
    "it is nothing but the vacuum energy density ( ved ) , i.e. , the pressure apart from the sign .",
    "this approach is non - perturbative ( np ) from the very beginning , since it deals with the expansion of the corresponding skeleton vacuum loop diagrams in powers of the planck constant , and thus allows one to calculate the ved from first principles . in accordance with this program",
    "we have extended @xcite to non - zero temperature in @xcite .",
    "this made it possible to introduce the correctly defined temperature - dependent bag constant ( bag pressure ) as a function of the mass gap .",
    "it is this which is responsible for the large - scale dynamical structure of the qcd ground state @xcite and coincides with the jaffe - witten ( jw ) mass gap @xcite by properties .",
    "the confining dynamics in the gluon matter ( gm ) is therefore nontrivially taken into account directly through the mass gap and via the temperature - dependent bag constant itself , but other np effects due to the mass gap are also present .",
    "being np , the effective approach for composite operators , nevertheless , makes it possible to incorporate the thermal perturbation theory ( pt ) expansion in a self - consistent way . in @xcite",
    "we have formulated and developed the analytic thermal pt which allows one to calculate the pt contributions in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small @xmath10 .",
    "we have also explicitly derived the first pt correction of the @xmath10-order to the np part of the gm equation of state ( eos ) , which we call the np gluon pressure , so it is understood as a main part of the full eos .    in this article from the very beginning , we are investigating a system at non - zero temperature , which consists of @xmath11 purely yang - mills ( ym ) gauge fields without quark degrees of freedom ( i.e. , at zero density ) .",
    "its primary aim is to explicitly show the hagedorn structure @xcite of the above - mentioned gluon pressure below some characteristic temperature @xmath3 . for its numerical value",
    "see fig . 1 below .",
    "we argue that it has to be identified with the hagedorn transition temperature @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 within our approach . in our opinion ,",
    "the hagedorn character of the expansion for any pressure ( calculated with the help of lattice or analytic methods ) in the region of low temperatures is of crucial importance for correct understanding and description of the gm dynamical content . for this",
    "we begin with sections ii , iii , and iv in which we shortly describe our results obtained earlier in @xcite .",
    "they are present here for the readers convenience in order to have a general picture at hand and because the book @xcite , where we have summarized our previous results , is not freely available . in the main sections",
    "v and vi we have numerically calculated the gluon pressure and analytically derived its low - temperature expansion in detail , respectively .",
    "it is explicitly shown that it is nothing else but the hagedorn - type exponential series for the effective gluonic excitations of various dynamical nature , which are expressed in terms of the mass gap only .",
    "section vii is devoted to a brief discussion of the high - temperature expansion for the gluon pressure . in section viii",
    "we discuss our conclusions .",
    "in the imaginary - time formalism @xcite , all of the four - dimensional integrals can be easily generalized to non - zero temperature @xmath9 according to the prescription ( let us remind that in all our publications as well as in this paper the signature is euclidean in order to avoid non - physical singularities at light - cone from the very beginning )    @xmath12    in other words , each integral over @xmath13 of the loop momentum is to be replaced by the sum over the matsubara frequencies labeled by @xmath14 , which obviously assumes the replacement @xmath15 for bosons ( gluons ) .",
    "introducing the temperature dependence into the gluon pressure @xcite , we obtain    @xmath16    where the corresponding terms in frequency - momentum space are :    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    @xmath18,\\ ] ]    @xmath19.\\ ] ]    in frequency - momentum space the intrinsically non - perturbative ( inp ) and pt effective charges become    @xmath20    and    @xmath21    respectively .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the following notations :    @xmath22    where , evidently , in all the expressions @xmath23 is the square of the three - dimensional loop momentum , in complete agreement with the relations ( 2.1 ) , and @xmath24 is a scale separating the low- and high frequency - momentum regions .    in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) @xmath25 is the mass gap , mentioned above , which is responsible for the large - scale dynamical structure of the qcd vacuum , and thus determines the scale of its np dynamics .",
    "we have shown that confining effective charge ( 2.6 ) , and hence its @xmath26-function , is a result of the summation of the skeleton ( i.e. , np ) loop diagrams , contributing to the full gluon self - energy in the @xmath27 limit ( the strong coupling regime for the effective charge ) .",
    "this summation has been performed within the corresponding equation of motion .",
    "it has been done without violating the @xmath11 color gauge invariance of qcd @xcite ( and references therein ) . in more detail ( including the interpretation of eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) and the explanation of all the notations above ) the derivation of the bag constant as a function of the mass gap and its generalization to non - zero temperature has been completed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the pt effective charge @xmath28 ( 2.7 ) is the generalization to non - zero temperature of the renormalization group equation solution , the so - called sum of the main pt logarithms @xcite ( its analog as as a function of the variable @xmath29 ( see below ) can be found , for example in @xcite ) . here",
    "@xcite is the asymptotic scale parameter for @xmath11 ym fields , and @xmath31 for these fields , while the strong fine - structure constant is @xmath32 @xcite . in eq",
    "( 2.7 ) @xmath33 can not go below @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 , which has already been symbolically shown in eq .",
    "it is worth reminding that the separation between effective charges ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , is not only exact but it is unique one as well .",
    "it has been done by the subtraction of the pt part from the full gluon propagator with the respect of the mass gap , see @xcite .",
    "the np pressure @xmath36 and the pt pressure @xmath37 , and hence the gluon pressure @xmath38 ( 2.2 ) , are normalized to zero when the interaction is formally switched off , i.e. , letting @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the initial normalization condition of the free pt vacuum to zero holds at non - zero temperature as well .",
    "one of the attractive features of the confining effective charge ( 2.6 ) is that it allows an exact summation over the matsubara frequencies in the np pressure @xmath40 given by the sum of the integrals ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) .",
    "collecting all the analytical results obtained in @xcite , we can write    @xmath41    here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are    @xmath44    and    @xmath45,\\ ] ]    respectively , while    @xmath46    and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by the relations    @xmath49    and    @xmath50    respectively . it is worth reminding that in the np pressure ( 3.1 ) the bag pressure @xmath51 ( 2.3 ) is responsible for the formation of the massive gluonic excitations @xmath47 ( 3.5 ) , while the ym part @xmath52 ( 2.4 ) is responsible for the formation of the massive gluonic excitations @xmath48 ( 3.6 ) .",
    "the so - called gluon mean number @xcite , also known as bose - einstein distribution , is    @xmath53    where @xmath26 and @xmath54 are defined in eq .",
    "it appears in the integrals ( 3.3)-(3.4 ) and describes the distribution and correlation of massless gluons in the medium . replacing @xmath54 by @xmath48 and @xmath47 we can consider the corresponding gluon mean numbers as describing the distribution and correlation of the corresponding massive gluonic excitations in the medium , see integrals @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eqs .",
    "they are of np dynamical origin , since their masses are due to the mass gap @xmath25 .",
    "all three different gluon mean numbers range continuously from zero to infinity @xcite .",
    "we have the two different massless excitations , propagating in accordance with the integral ( 3.2 ) and the first of the integrals ( 3.4 ) .",
    "however , they are not free , since in the pt @xmath57 limit they vanish ( the composition ( 3.3 ) becomes zero in this case ) .",
    "so the np pressure describes the four different effective gluonic excitations .",
    "the gluon mean numbers are closely related to the thermodynamic observables , especially to the pressure . its exponential suppression in the @xmath1 limit and the polynomial structure in the @xmath7 limit",
    "are determined by the corresponding asymptotics of the gluon mean numbers , see below .",
    "concluding , let us emphasize that the effective scale @xmath24 is not an independent scale parameter .",
    "due to extremization of the mass gap - dependent effective potential , from the stationary condition at zero temperature @xcite and the scale - setting scheme at non - zero temperature @xcite it follows that    @xmath58    so it is expressed in terms of the initial fundamental and unique mass scale parameter in our approach - the mass gap @xmath59 ( for simplicity , its squared version @xmath25 is conventionally called the mass gap as well throughout this paper ) .",
    "the introduction of @xmath24 is also convenient from the technical point of view in order to simplify our expressions , which otherwise would be rather cumbersome ( see below ) .",
    "one of our primary goals in @xcite was to develop the analytic formalism for the numerical calculation of the pt term ( 2.5 ) .",
    "it made it possible to calculate the pt contribution ( 2.5 ) to the gluon pressure ( 2.2 ) in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small @xmath10 .",
    "for this goal , it is convenient to re - write the integral ( 2.5 ) as follows :    @xmath60 - { 3 \\over 4 } \\alpha^{pt}(\\omega^2 , \\omega^2_n ) \\right],\\ ] ]    where    @xmath61    with the help of the expressions ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , and where    @xmath62,\\ ] ]    and @xmath63 is given in eq .  ( 3.5 ) .",
    "let us also note that in these notations    @xmath64    collecting all the results obtained in @xcite , where it has been explicitly shown that variable @xmath65 always is very small , we are able to present the pt part of the gluon pressure as a sum of the two terms , namely    @xmath66    where    @xmath67    with    @xmath68.\\ ] ]    here @xmath69 ( 4.6 ) describes the @xmath25-dependent pt contribution to the np term @xmath40 ( 3.1 ) , beginning with the @xmath10-order term .",
    "in fact , the whole expansion ( 4.6 ) is the correction in integer powers of @xmath10 to the np term @xmath40 ( 3.1 ) , i.e. , to call it the pt term is only convention .",
    "the @xmath70-order term is also a sum of the two terms , one of which depends on the mass gap and the other one does not .",
    "the corresponding convergent expansions for them in integer powers of a small @xmath65 ( or , equivalently , @xmath10 ) begin with @xmath70-order terms , see @xcite .",
    "they are not shown explicitly , since numerically they are much smaller than the first term in eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) . for this reason",
    "their consideration will be omitted in what follows .",
    "in other words , we put in eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) @xmath71 , on account of the series ( 4.6 ) up to @xmath70-order , as underlined above .",
    "concluding , let us note that the convergence of series ( 4.6 ) has been proven in @xcite as well .",
    "taking into account the above - mentioned remarks , the gluon pressure ( 2.2 ) then becomes    @xmath72    on account of eqs .",
    "( 3.1)-(3.4 ) . in the integral ( 4.7 )",
    "for @xmath73 the summation over the matsubara frequencies can be performed analytically , i.e. , exactly @xcite .",
    "so finally for @xmath74 , one obtains    @xmath75    here it is worth noting only that the pt term ( 5.2 ) describes the same massive gluonic excitations @xmath48 ( 3.5 ) , but their propagation , however , suppressed by the @xmath10-order",
    ". we can consider it as a new massive excitation in the gm , denoted it as @xmath76 .",
    "let us remind once more that the term @xmath74 is np , depending on the mass gap @xmath25 , which is only suppressed by the @xmath10 order . in the pt @xmath57 limit ,",
    "the above - defined composition @xmath43 becomes zero , as it follows from eqs .",
    "( 3.3)-(3.4 ) , and thus the gluon pressure @xmath38 itself shown in ( 5.1 ) .",
    "so it is truly np quantity , indeed , in agreement with the normalization condition of the free pt vacuum to zero .",
    "numerically calculated the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 . it has a maximum at some `` characteristic '' temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it is necessary to investigate the low - temperature ( below @xmath3 ) behavior of the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) in detail .",
    "it will make it possible to explicitly show the hagedorn nature of the corresponding expansion in this region . at the same time , its high - temperature ( above @xmath3 ) behavior suffices to briefly discuss .",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath29 ( solid curve ) .",
    "it has a maximum at @xmath77 ( vertical solid line ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed line is the general stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) constant @xmath78 .",
    "one can conclude that np effects due to the mass gap are still important approximately up to @xmath79.,width=377 ]",
    "in order to investigate the behavior of the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) in the low - temperature region ( @xmath80 ) let us note that in the integrals ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.4 ) and ( 5.2 ) the variable @xmath81 with the replacements @xmath82 is always small in this region , especially in the ( @xmath83 ) limit .",
    "so one can expand the corresponding mean numbers ( 3.6 ) in the form of the corresponding taylor series @xcite as follows :    @xmath84    and    @xmath85    with the above - mentioned replacements ( here @xmath14 is different from @xmath14 in eqs .",

    "so it shows an exponential rise in the number of dynamical degrees of freedom in this limit , explicitly seen in fig .",

    "the gluon pressure is exponentially suppressed . concluding this part ,",
    "let us stress that the hagedorn pressure ( 6.27 ) , and hence ( 6.30 ) , are closely related to the asymptotic of the gluon mean number ( 6.1 ) in the low - temperature region @xmath163 .",
    "it is even possible to say that the hagedorn structure of the expansion ( 6.27 ) is determined by the gluon mean number expansion in this temperature interval within the mass gap approach to qcd at finite temperature .",
    "in order to investigate the behavior of the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) in the high - temperature region ( @xmath164 ) , it is convenient to re - write it as follows :    @xmath165    where    @xmath166    it is easy to show that the expressions ( 5.1 ) and ( 7.1 ) are the same , because of the relations @xmath167 , where the integral @xmath168 is explicitly given in eq .  ( 3.2 ) . at moderately high temperatures up to approximately a few @xmath3 the exact functional dependence on the mass gap @xmath25 and temperature @xmath9 of the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) or , equivalently , ( 7.1 ) remains rather complicated . from fig . 1",

    "it is related to the corresponding asymptotic of the gluon mean number ( 3.7 ) . in the high - temperature limit @xmath169 , the gluon mean",
    "number @xmath170 can be reproduced by the corresponding series in powers of @xmath171 if the variable @xmath54 is restricted , namely    @xmath172 , \\quad \\beta \\rightarrow 0.\\ ] ]    let us note in advance that in what follows for our purpose it is sufficient to keep only the positive powers of @xmath9 in the evaluation of the high - temperature expansion for the gluon pressure ( 7.1 ) .",
    "let us also remind that calculated finally terms not depending on temperature should be omitted , by definition @xcite .",
    "omitting all these tedious but rather simple derivations , which can be explicitly found in @xcite , the high - temperature expansion for the gluon pressure ( 7.1 ) up to the leading and next - to - leading orders , is as follows :     is shown as a function of @xmath173 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the exact @xmath8 behavior is shown as a straight dashed line .",
    "it is clearly seen that the gluon pressure substantially deviates from the exact @xmath8 one . the solid curve approaches a straight dashed line only in the limit of very high temperature , starting approximately from @xmath174 , which corresponds to @xmath175 in agreement with fig . 1 and eq .",
    "( 7.6).,width=377 ]    @xmath176 , \\quad t \\rightarrow \\infty , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath177 and here it is more convenient to express the gluon pressure in terms of effective @xmath54 s ( 3.8 ) , ( 6.28 ) and mass gap itself .",
    "a non - analytical dependence on the mass gap occurs in terms @xmath178 , though @xmath25 is not an expansion parameter like @xmath10 is in hot pt qcd , where a non - analytical dependence on @xmath10 has been discovered ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the term @xmath179 has been first introduced in the phenomenological eos @xcite and widely discussed in @xcite . on the contrary , in our approach both terms @xmath179 and @xmath180 have not been introduced by hand .",
    "they naturally appear on a general ground as a result of the explicit presence of the mass gap from the very beginning in the np analytical eos ( 7.1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mass scale parameter in the leading np term @xmath179 in the expansion ( 7.4 ) is @xmath181 , by definition in eq .",
    "its numerical value is @xmath182 .",
    "the scale of the np dynamics investigated in @xcite is @xmath183 at almost the same @xmath3 as ours , namely @xmath184 .",
    "it may or may not be a coincidence , but these numbers are very close to each other , though obtained by different approaches .",
    "a few important issues concerning the high - temperature asymptotic of the gluon pressure ( 7.4 ) are to be discussed in more detail .",
    "the corresponding expansion for the composition @xmath185 $ ] , which enters the composition ( 3.3 ) , is as follows :    @xmath186    where the expression for the integral @xmath187 is not important for present discussion .",
    "so one can conclude that at high temperature the exact cancelation of the @xmath188 terms occurs within this composition . on the other hand , substituting it into eq .",
    "( 7.1 ) the cancelation of the @xmath189 term occurs within the np pressure @xmath40 itself . as it follows from fig .",
    "2 the both cancellations take place rather close to @xmath3 , and the gluon pressure demonstrates highly non - trivial dependence on the mass gap and temperature up to rather high temperature .",
    "it approaches the exact @xmath8 limit at very high temperature only , starting approximately from @xmath175 .    in a more compact form the previous expansion ( 7.4 )",
    "looks like    @xmath190 t , \\quad t \\rightarrow \\infty,\\ ] ]    where the first leading term , which analytically depends on the mass gap @xmath191 , comes from the pt part of the gluon pressure ( more precisely from the np part which is the @xmath10-order suppressed ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for both constants @xmath192 and @xmath193 ( which becomes zero in the pt @xmath57 limit ) can be easily restored from the expansion ( 7.4 ) , if necessary .",
    "concluding , a few remarks are in order to make .",
    "let us emphasize once more that the sb term disappears from the np gluon pressure ( 7.1 ) above @xmath3 due to the normalization of the free pt vacuum to zero from the very beginning .",
    "the cancellation of the truly np terms @xmath189 simply shows that direct @xmath8 behavior can not start just from @xmath3 due to rather complicated dependence of the gluon pressure on the mass gap and temperature in the moderately high temperature interval ( approximately up to @xmath79 , see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "it would be very surprised if a pure np contribution were survived in the limit of high temperature , while for its pt counterpart / correction it would be expected / possible .",
    "in other words , the @xmath189 behavior of @xmath38 in ( 7.1 ) is replaced by @xmath194 behavior in ( 7.4 ) or , equivalently , in ( 7.6 ) in this limit . at the same time , the second purely np term @xmath180 is suppressed in comparison with the first pt term in the high temperature limit in eq .",
    "( 7.6 ) , indeed .",
    "nevertheless , the approximate @xmath179 behavior up to rather high temperature of such thermodynamic quantity as the trace anomaly or , equivalently , the interaction measure @xmath195 , which is very sensitive to the truly np effects , is still possible . in other words ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath196 from the straight line can be not so big , unlike in fig",
    "it should be calculated in terms of the full pressure ( see discussion below at the end of section viii ) .",
    "the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) has a few remarkable features .",
    "first of all , below @xmath3 it is exponentially suppressed in the @xmath1 limit , see expansions ( 6.27 ) and ( 6.30 ) in this limit .",
    "its the most important feature is that at low temperatures @xmath80 it is nothing else but the hagedorn - type exponential series ( 6.27 ) for the effective gluonic excitations , which are expressed in terms of the mass gap , generated in its turn by the strong self - interaction of massless gluon modes .",
    "it is the only one which determines the confining dynamics in the gm @xcite .",
    "the hagedorn pressure of the glueball gas model is associated with a sum over a number of single noninteracting , relativistic particle species of the corresponding masses ( low - lying glueballs ) @xcite .",
    "however , it alone was unable to correctly describe the corresponding thermodynamics lattice data below @xmath3 , see for example @xcite . only adding the closed bosonic string contribution @xcite , modelling the high - lying glueballs @xcite exponential spectrum",
    ", success has been achieved .",
    "it is no a coincidence that @xmath11 lattice entropy density has been so nicely reproduced down to @xmath197 by taking into account the string - type , confining configurations of gluon fields in this joint approach ( glueball gas model plus bosonic string ) @xcite .",
    "our hagedorn exponential series ( 6.27 ) are very similar to those which have been previously found in the polyakov - nambu - jona lasinio ( pnjl ) approach by the extremization of the gluonic contribution to the thermodynamic effective potential with polyakov loop @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the polyakov loop contribution has been implemented into the initial njl model @xcite just in order to take into account the confinement dynamics there . as mentioned above in section vii",
    "its np scale @xcite is almost the same as ours .",
    "the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) has a maximum at some characteristic temperature @xmath198 , see fig .",
    "1 , at which its exponential rise at @xmath80 is changed to fall off at @xmath164 . the relevant degrees of freedom below @xmath3 are the effective gluonic excitations of different dynamical origin , expressed in terms of the mass gap ( some of these np excitations can be treated as massive quasi - particles / gluonic ( bosonic ) species ) . above @xmath3 they cease to exist , and the relevant degrees of freedom become weakly - interacting but still np objects , which pressure is dominated by the @xmath199-order term , see eq .",
    "such drastic change in the character of the transition at @xmath3 indicates that it might be of the first - order for the derivatives of the full pressure ( mentioned above and discussed below ) .",
    "thus , @xmath3 can be understood as the temperature of the phase transition from the gm to the gluon plasma ( gp ) .",
    "the scale of the exponential increase determines the value of the hagedorn temperature @xcite .",
    "just this happens in the expansion ( 6.30 ) in the @xmath2 limit .",
    "this means that maximum of temperature at which the hagedorn structure is valid is @xmath3 , so one has to identify @xmath3 with the hagedorn transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , there is no other choice than to put @xmath151 in the mass gap approach to qcd at non - zero temperature ( it can be also true for finite density , but this requires a separate investigation elsewhere ) .",
    "in other word , the mass gap approach makes the hagedorn - type exponential series to necessarily arise in hot qcd , see discussion in @xcite as well ( and references therein ) . in lattice @xmath11 thermodynamics @xcite the critical temperature is @xmath200 for the square root of the string tension @xmath201 .",
    "such a good agreement between our characteristic and lattice critical temperatures , namely @xmath202 , though obtained by completely different analytical and lattice methods , is a serious argument to equal our and lattice @xmath3 to the hagedorn transition temperature @xmath4 . for other justified arguments to identify @xmath3 with @xmath4 or to equal them ( exactly or approximately ) in different gauge groups for thermal ym fields",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for example , in string theory the ratio between @xmath4 and lattice @xmath3 is @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "the gluon pressure s ( 7.1 ) fall off just after @xmath3 is not a simple polynomial - type one , see figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "it is due to its rather complicated dependence on the temperature and mass gap in the region of high temperatures up to approximately @xmath6 .",
    "so np effects are still important within our approach in this temperature interval , i.e. , the gp can be considered as still remaining strongly interacting medium in this region . only in the limit of very high temperature @xmath7",
    "it can be considered as weakly interacting medium and the gluon pressure has a corresponding polynomial - type character , eq .  ( 7.6 ) .",
    "possessing so nice features , the np gluon pressure ( 7.1 ) at first sight seems to have one unpleasant `` defect '' . from fig .",
    "1 it clearly follows that it will never reach the general sb constant / limit at very high temperatures after @xmath3",
    ". however , that is not a surprise , since the sb term has been canceled in the gluon pressure from the very beginning due to the normalization condition of the free pt vacuum to zero , as discussed in some details in section vii .",
    "the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) may change its exponential regime below @xmath3 only in the close neighborhood of @xmath3 in order for its full counterpart to reach the requested sb limit at high temperatures .",
    "the sb term can not be added to eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) , even multiplied by the corresponding @xmath204-function . in this case",
    "the full pressure will get a jump at @xmath205 , which is not acceptable .",
    "so some other term(s ) , multiplied by the corresponding @xmath206-function , should be added as well in order to ensure a smooth transition across @xmath3 for the full gluon pressure .",
    "these problems make the inclusion of the sb term into the gluon eos ( 5.1 ) highly non - trivial in order to transform it into the full gluon eos . only after its inclusion into eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) in a self - consistent way , such obtained full equation can be called the gp pressure or , equivalently , the gp eos , and denoted as @xmath207 .    in this connection",
    ", one thing has to be made perfectly clear . the truly np gluon pressure ( 5.1 )",
    "will remain an important part of the full gp pressure .",
    "it is this which will determine the low - temperature dynamical structure of the full pressure and even will play a significant role in it rather far away from @xmath3 .",
    "let us emphasize once more that the gluon pressure @xmath38 ( though determined in the whole temperature range ) , but being the np part of the full pressure , is not obliged and can not reach sb limit at very high temperature .",
    "it is the full pressure @xmath207 , properly scaled , which is obliged to approach this thermodynamical limit , and should be a continuously growing function of temperature at any point of its domain from zero to infinity .",
    "thus the above - discussed unpleasant `` defect '' is not a real defect at all : on the contrary , the np gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) has a correct thermodynamic limit at very high temperatures ( 7.6 ) .",
    "the np effects can not indeed survive in the regime of very high temperatures , which is governed by the sb pressure @xmath208 of non - interacting massless particles ( an ideal gas limit of gluons ) .",
    "the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) satisfies to all the required thermodynamical limits .",
    "it is exponentially suppressed in the @xmath1 limit and has an exponential rise in the @xmath2 limit .",
    "this exponential increase in the number of dynamical degrees of freedom or , equivalently , an exponential grows in the density of states in this limit is clearly seen in fig .",
    "1 ( the same picture occurs in the string theory at the hagedorn transition @xcite ) . due to its hagedorn s nature ( 6.27 ) at @xmath80 the np gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) describes the gm as a dense states of the effective gluonic excitations of various dynamical nature , which are expressed in terms of the mass gap only .",
    "thus , it has a correct hagedorn structure at @xmath209 .",
    "it demonstrates rather complicated dependence on the mass gap and temperature up to approximately @xmath6 . in the limit of very high temperature @xmath7 it has a polynomial behavior consistent with the sb limit",
    "that is why it can serve as a basic equation for its transformation into the full gp eos , as discussed above .",
    "concluding , the main message we would like to convey is that the hagedorn structure of the pressure is of crucial importance to correctly understand and describe the gm dynamical content at low temperatures within any approach or model . in the forthcoming paper we will present a general formalism how to transform the gluon pressure ( 5.1 ) into the full gp eos in a self - consistent way ( i , e . , not destroying the hagedorn structure below @xmath3 , providing the smooth transition across @xmath3 and approaching to the sb limit above @xmath3 from below ) . completing this program , we will be able to analytically describe ym @xmath11 lattice thermodynamics @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
