    "are essentially in the @xmath2-wave channel ; however , all even - channel collisions are forbidden for spin - polarized fermions by the pauli exclusion principle . since dipolar interactions are also negligible , the fermi gas can be considered as non - interacting . in the experiments",
    "the atoms are trapped by magnetic or optical potentials , providing a confinement which can be well approximated as harmonic .",
    "the geometry of the trapping potential can be very anisotropic , thus allowing to reach quasi-1d or quasi-2d situations @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the quasi-1d geometry , which is the case of the paris experiment @xcite and is relevant for experiments on atom lasers and atomic waveguides . the 1d gas of non - interacting fermions serves also as a model for describing the 1d bose gas with hard - core point - like interactions ( tonks gas , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it was demonstrated by girardeau that there exists an exact mapping between the bosonic and the fermionc many - body wave functions , @xmath3 , valid also in the time domain @xcite .",
    "the tonks gas limit corresponds to the case of total reflection in a two - atom collision @xcite , and the interactions in 1d mimic the role of the fermi statistics .    in this paper",
    "we present some results for the exact equilibrium profiles and for the dynamical properties of a 1d fermi gas in harmonic confinement . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we illustrate the role of quantum statistics on the particle and kinetic - energy density profiles , and we investigate how the pauli principle influences the pair correlation function . in sec .",

    "in addition , we relate the result for the frequency of the quadrupole mode to a scaling property of the hamiltonian used in the long - wavelength limit . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] offers a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath4 non - interacting fermi particles confined in an external potential which is very tight in two spatial directions .",
    "we assume that the gas is in a quasi-1d situation where the transverse degrees of freedom are frozen , that is , the chemical potential is much smaller than the level spacing in the transverse direction . in this case",
    "the transverse wave function is the ground state one , which will factorize out from all the following calculations .",
    "we can thus focus only on the axial coordinate @xmath5 and define the external confinement along @xmath5 given by a real potential @xmath6 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will assume that the eigenfunctions @xmath7 are real  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the gas can be expressed in terms of the longitudinal one - body density matrix , which at zero temperature reads @xmath8 in the following we will give several examples of calculations of the exact spatial profiles obtained as the moments of the density matrix , and we will evaluate also the longitudinal pair distribution function .",
    "the zeroth moment of the one - body density matrix yields the equilibrium density profile @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the positions of the fermions and @xmath12 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the coordinate representation .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that @xmath9 can be written in terms of the green s function in coordinate space , @xmath13 , which is a function of the position operator @xmath14 : @xmath15 this equation expresses the density profile as the trace of the operator @xmath16 on the first @xmath4 quantum states ( @xmath17 ) . using the relation between the partial trace @xmath17 of a generic matrix @xmath18 and the determinant of the inverse matrix @xmath19 , @xmath20/ \\partial\\lambda|_{\\lambda=0 } , \\label{anna}\\ ] ] we obtain @xmath21_{\\lambda=0}\\;.\\ ] ] this alternative expression for the density profile is very practical for performing numerical calculations in the case of harmonic confinement , @xmath22 .",
    "for this specific potential the representation for both the position and the momentum operators on the basis @xmath23 of the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator is a tridiagonal matrix .",
    "thus the operator @xmath24 is tridiagonal : the determinant of such a matrix can be evaluated recursively through a renormalization procedure  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for the particle density profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at various number of fermions , as compared with the predictions of the local - density approximation : the latter neglects the shell structure and the spill - out from the classical border . because of the symmetry between position @xmath14 and momentum @xmath25 in the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian , the momentum distribution has exactly the same behaviour as the particle density illustrated in fig .",

    "we focus here on how the pauli exclusion principle is reflected in the pair distribution function of a gas of @xmath4 noninteracting fermions in harmonic confinement .",
    "the same results apply to a 1d bose gas with hard - core interactions , since the boson - fermion mapping holds for the pair distribution function @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal pair distribution function of a quasi-1d fermi gas is defined as @xmath37 where the function @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 this function can be calculated by an extension of the green s function method used in the previous sections to evaluate particle , kinetic energy and momentum flux densities  @xcite .",
