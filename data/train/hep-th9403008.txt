    "a new way to obtain singular background configurations as the solutions of string equations has been developed by using gauged wzw models @xcite , especially in low space - time dimensions @xmath3 although they are toy models of the realistic four dimensional theory , it is possible to study the scattering of string fields off these non - trivial black `` species '' ; black holes , black branes e.t.c . among those configurations , @xmath0 dimensional black hole",
    "anti de sitter spacetime @xcite has been examined according to the method developed in reference [ 1 ] , and also by the duality transformation of a @xmath0 black string @xcite . but",
    "both procedures preserve the conformal invariance only at the leading order in the @xmath4 expansion .",
    "a possible way to extract the conformally exact background configurations for metric and dilaton is , however , known @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study the @xmath0 dimensional black hole solution according to the procedure of @xcite with the limiting process of the gauging parameters @xcite .",
    "we first review the construction of the @xmath0 dimensional black string and discuss the limiting process by which it is transformed into the @xmath0 dimensional black hole anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "we then solve the off - shell tachyon field equation in this background , and we obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients of the scattering of the tachyon off the black hole .",
    "we also obtain an expression for the hawking temperature , which in a certain limit reduces to the statistical ( thermal ) value .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the black hole are thus clarified .",
    "the black string solution was first obtained by horne and horowitz @xcite , using the method originally developed by witten @xcite .",
    "the idea is as follows : the startingpoint is the wzw model of a group @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . after gauging an appropriate subgroup @xmath9 of @xmath5 by introducing the corresponding gauge fields ,",
    "the gauge fields are integrated out and the target space metric and antisymmetric tensor can be read off by rewriting the action to the corresponding 2d @xmath10-model on the world sheet .",
    "finally a dilaton field has to be included to ensure the vanishing of the @xmath11-function .",
    "this procedure guarantees the correct target space metric only at the semi - classical level , which here corresponds to the limit @xmath12 ( first order in @xmath2 ) , so quantum corrections are generally expected to arise .    in the exact treatment of the theory , valid to all orders in @xmath2 , it is convenient to proceed in a somewhat different way @xcite . consider the effective action in target space : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dilaton and target space metric for the coset model under consideration .",
    "the dots denote the possible higher order terms in @xmath16 as well as terms representing other string fields . the next step is to identify the linearised equation of motion of @xmath16 , which can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and the virasoro constraint which determines the conformal weight of @xmath16 .",
    "then we obtain : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the virasoro operators of @xmath19 .",
    "the virasoro operators , in turn , can be written in terms of the casimir operators for the group @xmath5 and subgroup @xmath9 , and they are expressed by the differential operators on the group parameter space . since the casimir operators contain single and double derivatives , one can read off the exact metric and dilaton by identifying the single and double derivatives on the two sides of eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "but we can not obtain the exact form of the anti - symmetric tensor in this procedure .",
    "however , we do not need it in the analysis hereafter .    taking @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", the axial gauging leads to the following results : @xmath22\\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace*{-2mm}&+&\\hspace*{-2mm}2k_1[1+\\frac{\\rho^2}{(1 - 2/k)(uv-1)-\\rho^2}]dr^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath23[1+\\rho^2 - 2/k+ \\rho^2\\frac{uv}{1-uv}]}.\\ ] ] here the notations of the group variables , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are according to reference @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is defined as , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the levels of @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , while @xmath32 is an `` external '' parameter which controls the ratio of the embedding of the @xmath33 subgroup to @xmath30 and @xmath33 . in the axial gauge , the coordinate @xmath34 is related to one of the other ( except @xmath35 ) parameters of @xmath36 in the limit of @xmath37 , the gauging of @xmath30 is turned off and the coordinates are written by using the three parameters of @xmath30 only .",
    "the central charge is : @xmath38 so that @xmath39 is obtained for @xmath40 .",
    "eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) are the exact form of the black string solution . in order to obtain the black hole solution , we take the parametrization of the coordinates in the region @xmath41 : @xmath42 then eqs . ( 4)-(5 ) become : @xmath43,\\ ] ] and : @xmath44[1+\\rho^2 - 2/k- \\rho^2\\tanh^2 r]}.\\ ] ] before coming to the black hole we notice that the usual black string form is obtained by the further change of coordinates : @xmath45    next we consider the limit of @xmath46 in order to obtain the black hole solution . in this limit",
    "the transformations ( 10 ) are not well - defined , so we take the change of variable , @xmath47 , only .",
    "then we get : @xmath48,\\;\\;\\;\\phi = const.\\ ] ] this limiting process effectively decouples @xmath30 in the gauging @xcite . therefore , in this limit the three group variables of @xmath30 are kept to represent the space - time , while the parameter of @xmath33 has been dropped . in the opposite limit @xmath49 , the gauging is done for @xmath30 only .",
    "then we obtain the solution of the 2d black hole , which is obtained in @xcite , and an independent one - dimensional space @xmath50 we can see further that the limiting processes produce no new solutions in the case of the vector gauging .",
    "this is because the parameters of @xmath30 and @xmath33 are not combined in the vector gauging .",
    "solution ( 11 ) is exactly the @xmath51 version of the @xmath0 dimensional black hole anti de sitter spacetime , found by baados _",
    "@xcite , if we periodically identify @xmath52 .",
    "the full two - parameter family of @xmath53-black holes is obtained by periodically identifying a linear combination of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this identification is equivalent to factoring out a discrete subgroup of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "notice also that the dimensionfull parameter @xmath56 @xcite , related to the cosmological constant , can be re - introduced by rescaling @xmath57 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "here it is however taken as unity .",
    "the reason for going through the black string construction is that we want to stress that the limiting process leading to ( 11 ) from ( 8) is somewhat ambiguous . for any finite value of @xmath58 the spacetime ( 8) is asymptotically flat , but has string - like curvature singularities surrounded by horizons .",
    "the spacetime ( 11 ) is however completely different : it is not asymptotically flat and it has no curvature singularities , but there is a horizon at @xmath59 . the disappearance of the singularity is understood from the wzw model point of view .",
    "this is because the background configuration is obtained from the ungauged @xmath30 in the limit @xmath60 the gauging procedure of @xmath30 is necessary to produce the singularity @xcite .",
    "concerning the thermodynamical properties , we also find some subleties related to taking the limit @xmath61 in this limit , the black string is equivalent to the extremal black string , whose statistical temperature is zero . on the other hand , the black hole ( 11 )",
    "has a non - vanishing statistical temperature given by the inverse period of the imaginary time @xcite : @xmath62 so although the black hole anti de sitter line element ( 11 ) comes out in the desired form , by taking the limit @xmath37 of the black string , more care is needed for various quantities when it comes to the more detailed analysis of the features of the black hole . in our further analysis",
    "we therefore simply take the line element ( 11 ) , for the @xmath0 dimensional black hole anti de sitter spacetime , as the starting point .",
    "we now consider the tachyon equation ( 3 ) in the background ( 11 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue of the @xmath63-operator is : @xmath64 where we take @xmath65 ( @xmath66 real ) , which is the principal series representation of @xmath30 .",
    "the on - shell condition @xmath67 ( compare with eq . ( 2 ) ) is obtained as @xmath68 for @xmath40",
    ". then we can solve eq.(3 ) with eqs.(11 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "the killing vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 suggest that the tachyon field should be solved as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( because of the periodic boundary condition for @xmath55 ) .",
    "the tachyon equation then reduces to the following second order ordinary differential equation for @xmath73 : @xmath74 further reduction of the problem follows a standard quantum mechanical calculation @xcite . introducing the variable @xmath75 and defining @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath78",
    ", we find : @xmath79 where : @xmath80 equation ( 17 ) is the well - known hypergeometric equation . for @xmath81 two independent solutions",
    "are provided by : @xmath82 and expressions for @xmath83 are obtained using the linear transformation formulas @xcite .",
    "we will be interested in the two regions @xmath84 ( @xmath85 near the horizon ) and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 the asymptotic anti de sitter region ) .",
    "near the horizon we find the general solution : @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 the first and second terms represent outgoing and ingoing waves , respectively . similarly we find in the asymptotic region ( @xmath91 ) : @xmath92e^{-(1 + 2i\\lambda)\\log\\hat{r}}\\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace*{-2mm}&+&\\hspace*{-2mm}[c_1\\frac{\\gamma(c)\\gamma(a - b)}{\\gamma(a ) \\gamma(c - b)}+c_2\\frac{\\gamma(2-c)\\gamma(a - b)}{\\gamma(a - c+1)\\gamma(1-b ) } ] e^{-(1 - 2i\\lambda)\\log\\hat{r}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these expressions ( eqs .",
    "( 20)-(21 ) ) we now define two different sets of mode solutions .",
    "the first set is defined to describe the tachyon scattering off the black hole .",
    "asymptotically it consists of both ingoing and outgoing waves , but at the horizon it is purely ingoing .",
    "it is thus obtained by the choices @xmath93 and @xmath94 and it follows that : @xmath95 as well as : @xmath96 and @xmath97 has been normalized to @xmath98 . the reflection and transmission coefficients can now be read off immediately : @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 as it should .",
    "it is interesting to consider the reflection coefficient as a function of @xmath102 which can be interpreted as the momentum in the @xmath34-direction . in the two limits we find : @xmath103 in order to help the understanding of the scattering , typical plots of @xmath104 for various values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 are presented in figs.1,2 . from fig.1 , it can be seen that the reflection coefficient shows a steep fall - off towards the asymptotic value @xmath107 for any @xmath105 .",
    "the reflected part , which is observed at `` large '' @xmath66 ( after the fall - off ) and represented by @xmath108 follows the boltzman distribution with the temperature @xmath109 ( 12 ) .    from fig.2",
    ", we can see the effect of the momentum in the @xmath55-direction . in order to realize the complete absorption ,",
    "larger @xmath34-momentum is necessary for larger @xmath55-momentum , to overcome the propagation of the tachyon in the @xmath55-direction .",
    "notice that by solving the equation : @xmath110 we can , for given @xmath111 , determine the critical value @xmath112 where , for @xmath113 the outgoing wave essentially follows the distribution ( 27 ) .",
    "let us now introduce another set of mode solutions that will be relevant to see the hawking radiation .",
    "asymptotically it will be purely ingoing , but near the horizon it has both outgoing and ingoing parts .",
    "it is obtained by the choices ( @xmath114 ) @xmath90 and : @xmath115 it follows that : @xmath116 as well as : @xmath117e^{-(1 + 2i\\lambda)\\log\\hat{r}}.\\ ] ] the two sets @xmath118 and @xmath119 are related by the bogolubov transformation : @xmath120 and it is then a standard calculation @xcite to evaluate the expectation value of the number operator @xmath121 in the vacuum state @xmath122 : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is given in eq .",
    "finally we define the hawking temperature by : @xmath125 we obtain : @xmath126^{-1},\\ ] ] and for @xmath127 we find : @xmath128 in agreement with the statistical value ( 12 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the above analysis of the reflection coefficient @xmath124 .",
    "the region where eq .",
    "( 36 ) is valid is where the reflection coefficient @xmath124 can be approximated by its asymptotic form @xmath129 . in this region",
    "the classical thermodynamical equiliburium is realized .",
    "the well - defined thermodynamical picture is obtained in the limit of large momentum in the @xmath34-direction , where we can understand the problem according to the classical mechanics .",
    "the conformally exact form of the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole solution is given according to the procedure developed in references @xcite , starting from the black string solution @xcite .",
    "the solution obtained in this way , however , is very different from the original black string in the spacetime structure , and it has different thermodynamical properties . through the analysis of the scattering of a tachyon off the black hole , we find that it is possible to recover the classical picture for large radial momentum of the tachyon .",
    "we observe the black body radiation of high momentum particles with the statistical temperature @xmath130 our results have been obtained for the @xmath51 black hole anti de sitter spacetime , but it is straightforward to generalize them to the full @xmath53 case .",
