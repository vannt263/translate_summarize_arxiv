    "in studies on colloidal suspensions of neutral particles with adhesive interactions @xcite , several attempts have been made to fit small angle scattering data by using baxter s `` sticky hard sphere '' ( shs ) model @xcite .",
    "in addition to a hard sphere ( hs ) repulsion , the shs potential contains a surface adhesive term , introduced by baxter as a limit of an attractive square well which becomes infinitly deep and narrow according to a particular prescription @xcite . for this model the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equations of the liquid state theory",
    "have been solved analytically within the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation , and expressions for the correlation functions are thus available @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , for a fluid with @xmath0 components the shs - py analytical solution requires the knowledge of a set of density - dependent parameters @xmath1 , to be determined through @xmath2 coupled quadratic equations @xcite .",
    "this feature makes baxter s shs - py solution for mixtures practically inapplicable to colloidal systems with significant polydispersity , i.e. with large @xmath3    polydispersity means that the mesoscopic suspended particles of a same chemical species may differ in size , charge or other properties .",
    "consequently , a polydisperse fluid is always a mixture with a large number of components and strong asymmetries ( in size , charge , etc . ) , even when all meso - particles belong to a unique chemical species .    in a recent paper ( hereafter referred to as reference i )",
    "@xcite we showed that the aforesaid shortcomings of the shs - py solution can be avoided by using a different version of shs potential , for which the oz equations are analytically solvable under a different closure , i.e. the `` mean spherical approximation '' ( msa ) @xcite . in this alternative shs model ,",
    "the adhesive term is defined starting from a yukawa attractive tail and taking the `` sticky limit '' of infinite amplitude and vanishing range , with their product remaining constant . in ref .",
    "i it was pointed out how , in the particular case of _ factorizable stickiness parameters _ in the adhesive term , the shs - msa solution leads to closed analytical expressions for scattering intensity and other `` global '' structure factors , which are valid for _ arbitrary _ @xmath0 and therefore are suitable to fit experimental scattering data from polydisperse systems .    in the present work we shall review the main points of ref .",
    "i , adding some new results and remarks .",
    "we shall then apply the shs - msa solution to small - angle - neutron - scattering data from a colloidal fluid formed by sterically stabilized silica particles .",
    "our shs potential is defined by    @xmath4    with factorizable stickiness parameters @xcite    @xmath5    which measure the strength of surface attraction . in eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) , @xmath6 is the hs potential and the next term stems from the `` sticky limit '' of a yukawa tail @xcite ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the hs diameter of species @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the asymmetrical dirac delta function defined by : @xmath12 if @xmath13 .",
    "the msa solution for this model is represented by the factor correlation functions    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and the expressions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be found in ref .",
    "i. once that the @xmath18 are known , all correlation and scattering functions are in principle computable .",
    "the _ partial _ structure factors are given by @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the unidimensional fourier transform of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 the kronecker @xmath24 @xmath25 the number density of species @xmath10 ) . the scattering intensity as well as other _ global _ structure factors can then be calculated , all these scattering functions being weighted sums of @xmath26 like @xmath27 ( here , the asterisk means complex conjugation ) . as an example",
    ", we mention the _ measurable averagestructure factor _ @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the molar fraction of species @xmath10 and @xmath30 its form factor .",
    "( [ m4 ] ) shows that the main difficulty in the computation of @xmath31 lies in the inversion of a @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 which usually becomes a formidable task with increasing @xmath3 nevertheless , as discussed in ref .",
    "i , when @xmath34 is factorizable as in eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , @xmath35 becomes a _",
    "dyadic _ ( or jacobi ) matrix , i.e. @xmath36 , which admits _ analytic _ inverse for _ any _ @xmath0 ( in general",
    ", the same property does not hold for baxter s shs - py solution @xcite ) .",
    "another important consequence of the dyadic structure is that it allows to compute the _",
    "global _ scattering factors _ bypassing _ a preliminary calculation of the individual @xmath37 . indeed , when @xmath38 is dyadic the sums @xmath39 can be worked out analytically ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) , unlike the most common case where they are performed numerically by evaluating @xmath2 independent contributions @xmath37 at each @xmath40 . when fitting experimental data , the availability of closed analytical expressions directly for scattering intensity and @xmath41 clearly represents a great advantage .",
    "to represent size polydispersity , we select @xmath0 possible diameters uniformly distributed in an interval @xmath42 with mesh size @xmath43 . each diameter @xmath9 characterizes a different component .",
    "its molar fraction is @xmath44 with @xmath45 expressed by a schulz distribution , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the gamma function , @xmath48 the average diameter , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51^{1/2}/\\left\\langle \\sigma \\right\\rangle $ ] measures the degree of size polydispersity .",
    "we use @xmath52 components when @xmath53 and @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "the model can in principle be worked out for any choice of @xmath56 , which meets the requirements that @xmath56 must be lenghts and @xmath57 must be proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "however , two choices are particularly interesting :    * model i * _ ( polydisperse in size but monodisperse in stickiness ) _ , which assumes that all particles have the same stickiness , i.e. @xmath59 here , @xmath60 measures the strength of surface adhesion ; @xmath61 is an energy , and @xmath62 a reduced temperature .",
    "high @xmath62 ( low @xmath60 ) values correspond to weak surface adhesion or high temperature ; vice versa , low @xmath62 ( high @xmath60 ) values mean strong attraction or low temperature .    * model ii * _ ( with stickiness polydispersity linearly related to the size one ) . _",
    "since it is reasonable to expect that larger particles attract each other more strongly , a simple way of introducing stickiness polydispersity is the choice @xmath63      polydispersity effects on @xmath64 can be best described after recalling some features of the monodisperse shs structure factor .    in @xmath65",
    "the presence of strong adhesive forces may be revealed mainly from its behaviour in the low-@xmath40 region . here",
    ", @xmath66 may differ significantly from @xmath67 exhibiting a drastic increase as @xmath68 ( see figure 1 for @xmath69 ) . more precisely , in ref .",
    "i we recognized the existence of two different `` regimes '' for @xmath70 respectively  above and below the _ boyle temperature , _",
    "@xmath71 where attractive and repulsive forces balance each other in such a way that @xmath72 vanishes ( the second virial coefficient @xmath72 appears in the low - density expansion of @xmath73 )",
    ". when @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) the fluid behaves  like pure hs without stickiness , repulsive forces are dominant , and @xmath76 - which is related to compressibility and density fluctuations - decreases with increasing volume fraction @xmath77 .  when @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) @xmath76  has a non - monotonic dependence on  @xmath77 .",
    "after an initial increase ( which may become very strong , signalling  the approach to a gas - liquid phase transition with critical temperature @xmath80 ) , an inversion occurs and  @xmath81 decreases with  @xmath77 .",
    "in other words , below @xmath82 the attractive forces are dominant at low @xmath77 , whereas repulsion prevails at higher  @xmath83    for polydisperse shs , there exist two similar `` regimes '' for @xmath84 .",
    "the new feature is that a crossover between these regimes can now be induced not only by a change of @xmath62 , but also by a change of polydispersity @xmath85 ( at fixed @xmath62 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the polydispersity effects on @xmath86 displaying its behaviour at @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 , as @xmath85 increases from @xmath90 ( monodisperse limit ) to @xmath91 and @xmath92 we employed form factors @xmath30 for homogeneous spherical scattering cores inside the particles , with scattering core diameters @xmath93 coincident with the hs ones , i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "polydispersity progressively dumps all oscillations in the first peak region and beyond . here",
    ", model i and ii are nearly equivalent , whereas their @xmath95 may strongly differ near the origin as a consequence of the different stickiness distributions .",
    "in fact , increasing @xmath85 ( at the fixed @xmath62 value ) does not produce marked differences in model ii .",
    "on the contrary , in model i a large polydispersity can overwhelm the attractive effects , leading to a strong hs - like decrease of @xmath96 and thus preventing the possibility of an instability in the system .    in ref .",
    "i this scenario was interpreted in terms of a _",
    "generalized boyle temperature , _ @xmath97 . from the low - density expansion of @xmath98 we derived @xmath99 as a generalization of @xmath72 when all form factors are included .",
    "then @xmath100 defines @xmath101 , which is a decreasing function of @xmath85 ( its expression is given in ref .",
    "i ) . clearly , @xmath102 in a @xmath103 diagram , above the curve @xmath104 there is the region corresponding to a `` hs - like , repulsive regime '' ; below , there is the `` attractive - regime '' region .",
    "now , as shown in the inset of figure 1 , @xmath105 of model ii decreases very slowly , asymptotically approaching @xmath106 therefore , all three @xmath107-states of figure 1 lie in the lower region . on the other hand , @xmath101 of model",
    "i is a rapidly decreasing function , with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this argument interprets the crossover from `` attractive '' to `` repulsive '' regime in terms of an increasing polydispersity .",
    "to investigate polydispersity effects in real colloidal fluids , we now apply our models to experimental data for silica particles coated with octadecyl chains and dispersed in benzene . for this system",
    "@xcite published a wide set of small - angle neutron - scattering results , which exhibit a crossover from `` hs - like repulsive '' to `` attractive '' regime controlled by variation of @xmath110 : on lowering the temperature , attractive effects increase and a reversible phase separation into two phases of different density occurs at @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113c .",
    "@xcite fitted their experimental data using an implementation by robertus _",
    "_ @xcite of baxter s shs - py model , with stickiness independent of size and size polydispersity represented by a rather limited number of components ( up to @xmath114 ) , due to the aforesaid shortcomings of the py solution .",
    "the form factors @xmath30 were calculated with a model of spherical three - layer particles , and a difference between hs and scattering core diameters , with @xmath115 , was admitted .    since our aim is not an exhaustive analysis of all data by duits _",
    "@xcite , in figure 2 we consider only two representative cases , with @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xmath113c and @xmath118 @xmath113c , respectively .",
    "the @xmath64 of the first sample ( figure 2a ) is typically `` hs - like '' , whereas at low @xmath40 the curve of figure 2b has an upswept shape characteristic of strong attraction . for simplicity",
    ", we calculate the form factors with a model of homogeneous spherical scattering cores .",
    "we have checked that this choice is essentially equivalent to the three - layer one , if appropriate average contrast and diameter ( @xmath119 nm ) are used , as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in figure 2a we first fit the experimental data by employing the monodisperse shs - msa model ( all particles having the same size and stickiness ; @xmath69 ) , with two free parameters , @xmath62 and @xmath120 the best fit results are : @xmath121 with the value of @xmath62 confirming that the system is in the `` repulsive '' regime .",
    "clearly , this model overestimates the first peak height and does not reproduce the rising part of the curve adequately .",
    "both these drawbacks can be overcome by taking size polydispersity into account .",
    "both model i and ii yield excellent agreement , and their results are nearly identical , indicating that the choice of stickiness distribution is irrelevant in this hs - like case .",
    "to use only two free parameters , i.e. @xmath122 and @xmath85 , for model i and ii we fix @xmath62 on the value found with the monodisperse model .",
    "the best fit results are : @xmath123 for model i , and @xmath124 for model ii ( using three free parameters , i.e. @xmath125 , does not alter our qualitative results ) .",
    "we remark that both our estimates of @xmath85 are consistent with the value @xmath126 of ref .",
    "moreover , comparison with figure 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that model i improves over its py counterpart of duits _",
    "_ this may be due to our use of a much larger number @xmath0 of components to represent the size distribution .",
    "in figure 2b we use a similar strategy . here",
    ", however , we have found impossible to satisfactorily fit the entire experimental curve with the monodisperse model .",
    "hence , we have forced @xmath62 to the value @xmath127 which best reproduces the data within the restricted @xmath40-range @xmath128 nm@xmath129 ( note that this value of @xmath62 indicates that the system is in the `` attractive '' regime ) .",
    "then , upon fitting the complete set of data with one free parameter , we find @xmath130 nm for the monodisperse model . on fixing @xmath131 , the best results for model i and ii are : @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "once again we note the importance of the polydispersity effects , which lower the first peak height correctly and improve the general agreement .",
    "both models are satisfactory , although model ii appears to be slightly superior , indicating , perhaps , that the difference of stickiness distribution is already becoming significant .",
    "however , this conclusion can not be definitive .",
    "in fact , further calculations ( not reported here ) under different conditions , yield ambiguous results .",
    "moreover , figure 1 shows that the differences between model i and ii are small at low @xmath85 values , as unfortunately occurs in the colloidal system investigated by duits _",
    "_ @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our results suggest the opportunity of further experimental investigations on similar fluids with larger polydispersity , where an analysis of @xmath134 at low @xmath40 could discriminate between different shs models and provide useful information about the unknown real stickiness distribution .",
    "the present study on a new polydisperse shs model has once again shown the importance of taking polydispersity effects into account when experimental scattering data are analyzed .",
    "we have found that even a small degree of size polydispersity , @xmath135 , can strongly modify @xmath64 with respect to the monodisperse case .",
    "we have pointed out the existence of `` repulsive '' and `` attractive '' regimes for @xmath86 with a crossover interpreted in terms of a `` generalized boyle temperature '' , dependent on the degree of polydispersity . in the presence of polydispersity",
    ", a crossover between these regimes can induced not only by a change of @xmath62 , but also by a change of @xmath85 ( at fixed @xmath62 ) .",
    "in addition to size polydispersity , we have considered two simple stickiness distributions ( model i and ii ) .",
    "our results indicate that the particular choice of stickiness distribution is irrelevant in fluids with small size polydispersity and weak coupling ( i.e. weak attraction and high temperature ) . on the contrary",
    ", stickiness polydispersity effects can be revealed from the low-@xmath40 behaviour of @xmath64 when size polydispersity is large and coupling is strong ( strong adhesive forces and low temperature ) .    as an application , we have employed model i and ii to analyze experimental scattering data for a colloidal fluid with short - range attractions .",
    "our best fit results are satisfactory and suggest the importance of the stickiness polydispersity ( model ii ) .",
    "however , the considered experimental system lies in a regime where it is impossible to unambigously discriminate between our two models .",
    "new scattering studies on fluids with larger size polydispersity and stronger adhesive forces would be desirable to get more insight into this problem ."
