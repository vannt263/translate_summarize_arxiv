    "neutrino astronomy by its @xmath3 flavor has been noted only recently @xcite , so called hortaus or earth skimming neutrinos .",
    "neutrino masses , their splitting and mixing , see fig.[fig1 ] , lead to a @xmath0 rise .",
    "indeed @xmath4 mixing guarantees a complete oscillation even at high energy , because of modest ( in cosmic unity ) neutrino oscillation distance : @xmath5 enriching rare @xmath0 lepton components . for an opposite argument @xcite at energies above @xmath6 gev up - going atmospheric @xmath7 neutrino",
    "are poorly converted into @xmath3 ones , see fig.[fig2 ] . therefore already at tevs energies and above , @xmath0 astronomy is noise free .",
    "but only at higher energies , @xmath8  pev the @xmath0 air showering is well detectable @xcite .",
    "the problem of @xmath3 neutrinos crossing , interacting external crust and escaping , as uhe @xmath3 , the earth @xcite is complicated : the terrestrial neutrino opacity at different energies and angles of arrival , the @xmath3 energy losses and its interaction lengths at different energies and materials , makes difficult to estimate the expected rate .",
    "such a prediction is further complicated by the existence of a list of theoretical models for the assumed incoming neutrino fluxes ( gzk neutrinos , z - burst model flux ( see fig.[fig1 ] and @xcite ) , @xmath9 flat spectra , agn neutrinos , topological defects ) .",
    "even extreme light and non - degenerated neutrino masses may play a role in uhecr spectra split in multi bump and zev energy modulations ; see fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "most of the authors focus on the uptaus tracks in underground @xmath10 detectors .",
    "we showed that our results give an estimate of the @xmath3 air - shower event rates that exceeds earliest studies @xcite but they are comparable or even below more recent predictions @xcite .",
    "different rate estimations are leading to a vanishing number of events a year @xcite in euso , a fraction of unity of them @xcite or a few of events a year @xcite in auger array observable from the ande shadows ( on west side ) as well as a dozen of events for euso in three years @xcite .",
    "we pointed out @xcite that the consequent @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 bundle fluence and signature of hortaus largely differs ( by its electromagnetic richness ) from that of horizontal filtered uhecr backgrounds at far horizons .",
    "also new net charge single bundle ( by hortaus ) are possible at high altitude splitting air - showers ( see fig.[fig3])@xcite .",
    "we apply all our previous results to the calculation of the averaged expected number of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the up atmosphere see fig.[fig5 ] . these up - going muon peak flux @xmath14 ( @xmath15 below horizons ) , originated by _ guaranteed _",
    "gzk @xmath3 secondaries , exceed the observed up - going muon atmospheric one @xmath16 ( induced by atmospheric neutrinos ) , making the search of rare bundles a realistic neutrino telescope above the noise .",
    "crown array by large areas surfaces ( @xmath17 @xmath18 ) on top mountains are needed @xcite .",
    "this search at horizons atmosphere regards also glashow s resonance @xmath19 , @xmath20 ev .",
    "also @xmath3-channel may lead via @xmath21 to tau air - showers .",
    "similar to @xmath22 neutrino astronomy might arise in susy models by uhe @xmath23 via s - electrons resonance @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these showers will split by geomagnetic fields , into twin fingers defined by their charges ( muon and electron pair arcs and rectilinear @xmath13 paths for tens and hundreds of km distances , see ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "their imprint may be soon revealed in on going magic telescope test at horizons by the discover of twin spots lights a few degree one from the other,@xcite .",
    "also up - ward horizontal muon bundles at top mountain in present ( usa ) and future milagro detectors ( bolivia ) are a very promising road to astrophysical @xmath25,@xmath2 neutrino air - showers . in conclusion",
