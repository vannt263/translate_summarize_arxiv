    "it is generally believed that there is a cosmic landscape in string theory @xcite .",
    "one expects the string scale to be in between the hubble and the planck scale , @xmath0 , so that a single planck scale field range in the landscape naturally contains many string scale features . when the vacuum energy is not too far below the string scale , the universe is expected to undergo cosmic inflation , which describes how our universe began .",
    "the inflationary universe scenario is strongly supported by theoretical considerations and observational data . for our purpose here , the cosmic landscape may be approximated by a @xmath1-dimensional random potential , and the inflaton ( the scalar mode for inflation ) path appears smooth in the coarse - grained limit , but is actually rugged with fine - grained string scale features . in this paper , we will present two generic properties of such an inflationary scenario :    1 .",
    "at least 60 e - folds of inflation is necessary in an inflationary scenario to solve the well - konwn cosmological problems such as the flatness and the horizon problems . to achieve this in the slow - roll inflationary scenario",
    "usually requires an almost flat smooth potential . without any fundamental theory",
    ", one can always invent such a potential .",
    "however , in the context of string theory , such an almost flat potential requires some fine - tuning . while a generic potential may not be flat enough ,",
    "it is not necessarily smooth either .",
    "a rugged @xmath1-dimensional potential is more realistic in the context of the cosmic landscape ( fig.[fig_pot ] ) , where @xmath2 . for large enough @xmath1 ,",
    "percolation probability approahes unity so the wave function of the universe is mobile in the landscape @xcite . for a planck scale field range ,",
    "one expects many string scale features and consequently the inflaton takes a meandering path . since the de - sitter quantum fluctuation ( @xmath3 ) is smaller than the size of the features ( @xmath4 ) , the turns of the inflaton path may be treated as classical scatterings .",
    "we will prove that an arbitrary detour of the inflaton path always increases the travel time , leading to more e - folds than given by the corresponding coarse - grained smooth potential .",
    "with appropriately many features in the potential , enough e - folds of inflation becomes generic .",
    "although the scenario is motivated by the cosmic landscape , if a specific string compactification is complicated enough , a brane motion inside the bulk can exhibit similar meandering behavior .",
    "the above scenario naturally leads to fluctuations in the the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) temperature ( tt ) and polarization ( te / ee ) power spectra .",
    "these fluctuations are due to the turns and detours of the inflaton path in the @xmath1-dimensinal potential . due to the randomness of the features in the potential , such fluctuations appear with irregular spacings , magnitudes and shapes @xcite . while some of these features are probably too fine and/or small to be detected , a few big fluctuations",
    "may already have been observed in the data @xcite . with more data coming in the future",
    ", one expects this prediction to be well tested .",
    "the existence of such fluctuations will have a profound impact on the inflationary scenario , on the origin of our universe and on the existence and properties of the cosmic landscape .",
    "let @xmath5 be the canonical inflaton field in the @xmath1-dimensional field space ( indices are raised by @xmath6 ) , and let @xmath7 be the actual @xmath1 dimensional scalar potential .",
    "we assume that over relatively large field distances , the potential appears coarse - grained smooth , denoted by @xmath8 , which may or may not be flat enough to support 60 e - folds of inflation , and may suffer from the @xmath9 problem . for a small enough field range , we are safe to keep only the linear term in the taylor - expansion of @xmath8 . without loss of generality , for a specific small field range , we can rotate to the basis @xmath10 ( @xmath11 denotes all directions transverse to @xmath12 . ) , so that @xmath8 for this segment has gradient only along the @xmath12 field , @xmath13 where the constant @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the validity range of the linear expansion .",
    "this yields a straight inflaton path from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "when the inflaton moves beyond @xmath15 , one needs to re - expand the potential with a new slope @xmath18 and a new @xmath12 direction . in this way",
    ", one can approximate an arbitrary coarse - grained smooth potential using a set of piecewise linear segments .    in this work ,",
    "we take the hubble parameter @xmath19 and we use the slow - roll approximation ( @xmath20 ) for the field range @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the qualitative properties are robust even when these approximations are relaxed .",
    "now the actual potential is rugged instead of smooth .",
    "let us introduce fine grained features to @xmath8 ( [ bgv ] ) to reproduce or to better approximate the actual potential .",
    "starting with @xmath22 at @xmath23 , the slope @xmath24 changes at @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant vector parameter for the @xmath31-th step .",
    "the potential for @xmath32 now becomes ( denote @xmath33 ) @xmath34   - \\vec{s}(k ) \\cdot \\left [ \\vec{\\phi } - \\vec{\\phi}(k ) \\right ] ~.\\ ] ] since we are treating @xmath8 as the background potential , we require that , after @xmath35 steps , @xmath36 will reach @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 we also require that both the coarse - grained smooth potential @xmath39 ( [ bgv ] ) and the actual potential @xmath40 ( [ radpot ] ) begin at @xmath41 with value @xmath42 and end at @xmath43 with value @xmath44 ( as illustrated in fig.[fig_pot ] ) , namely @xmath45 = b\\ , \\sigma_f ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us count the number of free parameters . for @xmath35 steps , we introduce @xmath46 time parameters @xmath25 ( @xmath47 ) . for each @xmath48 and @xmath12",

    "the actual potential can be approached in the @xmath53 limit .    to proceed , we need to properly choose @xmath15 , so that not only the linear expansion is valid , but also the @xmath12 field is monotonic and can be used as our `` clock '' .",
    "( otherwise , we have to choose a finer - grained piece - wise linear approximation . )",
    "as we shall see , this also limits the sizes of the kinks .",
    "we now show that _ an arbitrary detour from @xmath8 ( [ bgv ] ) will take longer to reach @xmath44_. such an increase in the number of e - folds of inflation is unbounded from above .    using @xmath12 as the variable",

    "we now show how arbitrary features of the potential increases the number of e - folds when compared to the smooth linear potential .",
    "let us also generalize the piecewise constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 to continuous functions of @xmath12 ( one may view this as a @xmath60 limit ) so the number of e - folds can be expressed as @xmath61 .",

    "we have employed the lagrangian multipliers @xmath68 to impose the constraints ( [ i_cstr ] ) and ( [ vscstr ] ) .",
    "using the variational method to find the stationary solution , we first require @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 we get the solutions @xmath71 , @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "this means turning off transverse motions decreases the e - folds of inflation , i.e. , for an arbitrary path along the @xmath12 direction , any detour in the transverse directions always increases the travel time .",
    "in fact , the increase is unbounded from above .",

    "actually , both terms are semi - positive . the first term in eq.([neinc ] )",
    "is always positive with transverse motion . in the presence of non - zero @xmath66 , positivity of",

    "we therefore see explicitly from eq.([neinc ] ) that @xmath78 \\ge n_e[0]$ ] . for @xmath55 , or no transverse motion ,",
    "the increase is from the second term in eq.([neinc ] ) alone . for @xmath101 , if there is transverse motion , the first term always increases the e - folds of inflation .    to get an intuitive sense of the picture , consider fig.[fig_pot ] for the @xmath55 case when @xmath102 .",

    "we can break it into @xmath107 pieces , and the more we break it , the better it approximates the actual potential",
    ". more fine - grained features will always increase e - folds ; here we have @xmath112 . for @xmath57 with transverse motions , the curves in fig.[fig_pot ] now represent @xmath54 ( [ radpot1 ] ) .",
    "the _ actual _ @xmath1-dimensional potential represented by @xmath54 always yields more e - folds than the corresponding @xmath55 potential shown , due to the detours of the inflaton field .",
    "most e - folds come from the regions with the smallest slope , where the constant @xmath3 and the slow - roll approximations are most valid .",
    "if one relaxes the @xmath19 and the slow - roll approximations , one can show using the hamilton - jacobi approach that the solution corresponding to the minimal e - folds is given by an exponential potential .",
    "that is , for a given drop @xmath113 in the hubble parameter over a given field range @xmath114 $ ] , the minimal e - fold path is given by ( @xmath115 ) @xmath116 where inflation takes place when @xmath117 .",
    "any deviation from this path will yield more e - folds .",
    "the linear piecewise potential can be replaced piecewise by this form for @xmath3 .",
    "both this @xmath3 and the corresponding exponential form of the potential approach linear when the @xmath118 parameter is small and/or the field range is small .",
    "it is clear that an arbitrary detour from such a potential will again lead to an increase in e - folds .",
    "so the qualitative properties of the scenario reman intact .",
    "we expect the string scale and/or the hubble scale to provide the cut - off on how fine - grained the actual potential can be . with appropriate characteristics of the actual potential",
    ", the enhancement can be large enough to give 60 or more e - folds .",
    "we have assumed that the slope is always monotonic , @xmath119 .",
    "it is argued in ref.@xcite that the percolation probability @xmath120 in a random potential for large @xmath1 .",
    "this is intuitively reasonable , since the inflaton has more choices of directions to move classically down a random potential as @xmath1 is large . for the cosmic landscape",
    ", we expect @xmath2 , so the assumption @xmath119 is quite natural . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "percolation is not assured . for @xmath55 , the system typically does not percolate , so the monotonic condition on the slope",
    "is imposed by hand .",
    "the scenarios we have in mind have @xmath2 .",
    "with @xmath1 canonical scalar fields , the scalar perturbation @xmath121 evolves in conformal time @xmath122 according to @xmath123 v^j = 0 ~.\\ ] ] if we model leading order effect due to the inflaton scattering by turning on @xmath124 at @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath125 to leading order @xmath126 .",
    "the actual features in the potential may be more complicated with higher order derivatives in @xmath7 .",
    "however , for two point function , only @xmath127 is relevant .",
    "accordingly , @xmath128 , and the perturbation mode equation becomes ( after ignoring @xmath118 terms ) @xmath129 with @xmath130 . between the @xmath131-th and the @xmath132-th scattering , i.e. @xmath133 , we can write @xmath134 generalizing the approach in ref.@xcite , we derive the coefficients @xmath135 recursively , by matching the boundary conditions at each @xmath136 . starting with the bunch - davies vacuum @xmath137 at @xmath138 , we get ( to leading order in @xmath139 ) , @xmath140    assuming @xmath141 , the adiabatic power spectrum @xmath142 is @xmath143 incorporating the time dependence of @xmath3",
    ", we can parametrize @xmath144 , which represents the gross feature of the power spectrum , with @xmath145 , @xmath146 at @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "the inflaton scatterings will impart fluctuations of magnitude @xmath148 on such a smooth power spectrum ( fig.[fig_pk ] ) .",
    "for single field @xmath55 , the features correspond to sudden changes in the potential gradient , while for multifield @xmath2 , the features arise due to the turning of inflaton trajectory",
    ". the turning angle can be quite large @xmath84 , and still be compatible with data since @xmath85 for the multifield case .",
    "although features arise due to different reasons in the single field and multifield scenario , one can not tell the difference from their appearance in the power spectrum .",
    "if we assume that a few of such features already have been detected in the data @xcite , two possible scenarios seem to emerge : ( 1 ) the spacings between fluctuations ( i.e. , scatterings ) can be many units of @xmath149 , say @xmath150 ; ( 2 ) although the spacings between fluctuations are too small to be resolved , a few occasional fluctuations are big enough and relatively well spaced to be observed .",
    "fluctuations in the primordial power spectrum may have a chance to show up in the cmb temperature power spectrum .",
    "looking at the un - binned tt cmb power spectrum released by wmap @xcite , one sees that it fluctuates for about @xmath151 ( for @xmath152 ) . however , due to the large error bars of the same magnitude ( @xmath153 ) , it is hard to claim any features based on current data .",
    "the usual data analysis approach bins a few tens of multiple moments together to give a relatively smooth tt power spectrum over all angular scales .",
    "however , given the presence of fluctuations in the primordial power spectrum , the data binning approach will have smoothed out these features if they appear frequent enough .",
    "planck can provide cosmic variance limited measurements up to @xmath154 .",
    "in fact @xmath155 for planck in the range @xmath156 .",
    "so each @xmath151 fluctuation in @xmath157 will be a @xmath158 effect for planck .",
    "once such features are revealed in the tt power spectrum , they must appear in the te / ee polarization power spectra at the same angular scales , providing an important check on our predictions .",
    "the presence of fluctuations in the power spectrum will imply that the inflaton is mobile in the random potential , i.e. , the cosmic landscape .",
    "since our universe has gone through the cosmic landscape only once in this scenario , the fluctuations in the cmb power spectrum will reveal this particular path of our past history .",
    "in the paper , we have presented a scenario where a large number of scalar fields collectively contribute to cosmic inflation .",
    "it is important to distinguish our scenario from existing multifield scenarios like assisted inflation @xcite and n - flation @xcite .    in the assisted inflation scenario ,",
    "different fields have identical uncoupled potential .",
    "the trajectory of inflaton field is most likely a smooth path close to a straight line during the few e - folds relevant for cmb observation , which does not allow entropic perturbations to play any role .",
    "if the single field potential has some features like steps or kinks , each field will experience the same feature as it rolls down the potential .",
    "this will create identical features on the power spectrum with the same shape / magnitude . in the n - flation scenario ,",
    "a large number of axion fields play the role of the inflatons .",
    "if we only keep the leading order one - instanton terms , and taylor expand each axion potential around its minimum , we get a set of fields with different masses . at one - instanton level ,",
    "different inflaton fields still decouple , but since their masses are all different , the inflaton trajectory could be curved",
    ". however , the turning of the inflaton field is very mild in the slow - roll regime , and again does not lead to sharp features in the power spectrum .",
    "one can keep the sub - leading multi - instanton terms in the potential ; this will explicitly introduce couplings between the fields , and could make the inflaton path more convoluted , therefore providing an explicit realization of the meandering inflaton in string theory . in this case , our approach provides a different perspective to the analysis of these complicated scenarios . in particular , our analysis implies that the simplified analysis carried out in the literature on such a scenario may substantially under - estimate the e - folds produced by the model .",
    "there has been a lot of conjectures regarding the features in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "however , it is not clear what is the origin of such sharp features from string theory . in ref.@xcite and @xcite",
    ", features in the potential are well motivated to arise from duality cascade or monodromy . here",
    "we provide another natural motivation : the meandering of the inflaton in the cosmic landscape .",
    "regarding observations , duality cascade and monodromy lead to features on the power spectrum with predicted location and magnitude , while here we have random fluctuations in the power spectrum which is extremely hard to be picked out by current data analysis approaches .",
