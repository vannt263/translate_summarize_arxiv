    "the interaction respects the symmetry , but the ground state breaks it @xcite .",
    "for instance , in matter , lorentz symmetry is lost which leads to the mixing of different spin states even when the interaction lagrangian respects all the required symmetry properties . a well - known example of this is @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing in nuclear matter as was first shown by chin @xcite or @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition there might be mixing between different isospin states in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath1 mixing provides one such example as suggested in @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to identify the effects of scalar and vector meson mixing on dilepton production rates , which could in turn be observed in high energy heavy ion experiments .",
    "it is well known that the electromagnetic radiation provides a penetrating probe to study various in - medium properties of vector mesons .",
    "stimulated by the idea that in nuclear matter the vector meson properties might be modified from their vacuum values as a precursor phenomenon to chiral symmetry restoration , a great deal of effort has been directed to understand their properties in hot and/or dense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "several experiments have measured , or are planning to measure , dilepton pair production in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "such measurements have been carried out by the dilepton spectrometer ( dls ) at lawrence berkeley national laboratory @xcite , and by helios @xcite and ceres @xcite at cern .",
    "the na50 collaboration also measures dileptons yields in the light vector meson mass range @xcite .",
    "two new initiatives to be mentioned in this context are phenix @xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and hades at the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi)@xcite . density - dependent effects can also be found in experiments at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) @xcite .",
    "as the effects to be discussed here are mostly density - driven , the latter two facilities represent the energy regime and physical conditions perhaps more relevant for the present study .",
    "however , the physics discussed here could also be highlighted in an eventual low - energy rhic run .    for the understanding of the data in these experiments it is important to uncover the various processes which might lead to the production of dileptons and to estimate their relative contribution to the total production rate .",
    "some effort has already being put in obtaining some `` standard '' sources related to the decay channels of various light mesons and processes like @xmath9 or @xmath4-@xmath5 annihilation @xcite .",
    "but the opening - up of new channels related to scalar - vector mixing , which constitutes the material to be presented in this paper , has only been addressed recently .",
    "the mixing of mesons considered here includes both the isoscalar and isovector channels . to be more specific",
    ", we estimate the rate of dilepton production from @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing . even though some attention was paid to the former in the context of heavy - ion collisions @xcite , the importance of the latter",
    "was shown only recently in a zero temperature estimate of the dilepton production cross section @xcite .",
    "the studies of the effects of mixing made so far were limited to calculations of cross - sections .",
    "this paper reports on calculations of the thermal production rates of dileptons induced by scalar - vector mixing in the isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "those results are then compared against standard @xmath3-@xmath3 , @xmath4-@xmath5 annihilations , at different temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "note that processes involving mixing of different g - parity states like @xmath0-@xmath1 or @xmath7-@xmath8 are allowed only in matter which is not invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "therefore , @xmath10",
    "@xmath11  @xmath12 through their coupling to nucleons via @xmath0 and @xmath1 or @xmath13 mediated by @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing , can take place , as will become clear later , only in matter with finite nucleon chemical potential .",
    "hence a natural place to look for such density - driven effects are experiments involving relatively low energy where one expects to have a relatively large chemical potential .",
    "the model used here is walecka - like with the inclusion of the @xmath8 meson and its mixing with the @xmath7 meson .",
    "the role of @xmath8 in the context of nuclear matter calculation has also been discussed in ref .",

    "it is clear that the mixing amplitude vanishes for chemical potential @xmath37 .",
    "this is expected , as such mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( or @xmath7-@xmath8 ) opens up new channels which violate g - parity conservation .",
    "this can only happen when the ground state is not invariant under charge conjugation as is the case in nuclear matter with finite nucleon chemical potential .",
    "in fact , isospin eigenstate @xmath1 , which ( ignoring small mixing with @xmath7 induced by the quark mass difference and electromagnetic effects ) in free space can not decay into two pions , in a thermal bath through its coupling with nucleon - antinucleon ( or hole ) excitation can decay into a pion pair with intermediate @xmath0 meson @xcite . the same argument holds true for @xmath7 which in matter can decay into @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "note that the mixing amplitude vanishes at @xmath39 .",
    "physically this corresponds to the situation when there is no way for the vector particle to distinguish between longitudinal and transverse direction and therefore rotational invariance forces them to be degenerate forbidding mixing of different spin states in this limit . on the other hand , it has also been observed that at very high momenta @xmath36 falls off .",
    "this corresponds to the situation when collective effects , which basically related to the long wave length oscillations , die off with high momenta .",

    "@xmath61 is then calculated numerically .",
    "first we concentrate on the isoscalar channel or in other words the effect of @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing on the dilepton production rate . as the mixing amplitude now involves the @xmath1 propagator",
    "we observe a sharp peak in the vicinity of the @xmath1 mass .",
    "obviously this mixing amplitude depends on the density and the temperature .",

    "it is evident that at higher density the effect of mixing is also high .",

    "it is to be noted that to calculate the dilepton rate we have used tree level propagator for @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in ref.@xcite it is argued that @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing broadens the @xmath1 decay width substantially in nuclear matter at high density .",
    "this is understandable as now @xmath1 thorough nucleon - antinucleon ( hole ) excitations can decay into pion pairs as opposed to vacuum because of g - parity violation in matter .",
    "therefore in matter this decay channel enjoys a larger phase space and becomes as broad as @xmath7 as its vacuum mass is almost degenerate with that of @xmath7 meson .",
    "but at the one loop level the diagonal elements of the mixed propagator would also reduce its mass ( off - diagonal elements have little effect on the effective mass ) .",
    "now if one considers the broadening induced by the off - diagonal element of the dressed propagator of the @xmath1 meson , then to be consistent one should also take the medium modified mass for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "it is well - known that in walecka model @xmath1 meson mass also drops @xcite which would again reduce the phase space .",
    "these two competing effects are not expected therefore to change the in - medium width of @xmath1 significantly .",
    "we , however , adopt a different point of view .",
    "our focus here is to see the effect of mixing on the dilepton production and how it compares with @xmath3-@xmath3 annihilation .",
    "it should be noted that the contribution from @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing does not change the resultant spectra much expect a small peak representing @xmath1 meson pole in the transition amplitude . however , we expect an @xmath1 peak in the dilepton spectra even in the absence of meson mixing .",
    "the situation , as we shall see , is different for the isovector mode .",
    "there the dominant contributions are distributed near the tail of the @xmath3-@xmath3 annihilation spectra ( @xmath7 spectral function ) . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath7 spectral function gets sufficiently broadened this effect might become more visible near the @xmath1 peak region where additional contributions would come from the mixing .",
    "next we discuss the effect of mixing in the isovector channel which involves @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing in fig.[fig : rd50 ] ( [ fig : rd75 ] ) for t=50 mev ( 75 mev ) .",
    "this induces an @xmath8 bump just below the @xmath6 peak .",
    "@xmath7-@xmath8 channel seems to be more interesting as it induces additional contribution beyond the tail of @xmath7 spectral function .",
    "one can easily observe from fig [ fig : rd50 ] that even at density @xmath62 the contribution of the mixing wins over the @xmath3-@xmath3 annihilation rate in the vicinity of m = 1.0 gev . naturally at higher density",
    "this goes up as evident from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rd50 ] .",
    "[ htb ! ]",
    "interestingly enough the dilepton yield induced by the mixing in the isovector channel at higher temperature also seems to be significant as evident from the figures below .",
    "[ htb ! ]    note that , unlike @xmath1 , the broadening induced by the mixing on @xmath7 decay width has been found to be marginal .",
    "one can understand this physically .",
    "mixing opens up a new channel for @xmath7 to decay into @xmath3-@xmath58 .",
    "@xmath58 being quite heavy only the tail part of the @xmath7 can contribute .",
    "therefore it does not enjoy much of phase space to decay into @xmath64 .",
    "it does seem reasonable to conclude that @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing provides more promising kinematical window in the invariant mass spectra to study exclusive in - medium effects .      for completeness",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectra50 ]  and  [ fig : spectra75 ] the total dilepton yield with the combined effects of mixing in both the isoscalar and isovector channels .",

    "[ htb ! ]",
    "to conclude and summarise , we have estimated the dilepton production rates arising from scalar and vector meson mixing in different isospin channel involving nucleon -hole ( or anti - nucleon ) excitations as intermediate states .",
    "the rates have been compared against the @xmath3-@xmath3 annihilation in the p - wave channel ( @xmath7-channel ) and @xmath4-@xmath5 annihilation .",
    "higher yield of dileptons in the invariant mass region between the @xmath7 and the @xmath6 peaks are expected .",
    "the mixing in the isoscalar channel contributes mostly between the two - pion threshold and the @xmath1 peak but is small compared to the @xmath3-@xmath3 annihilation contribution . on the other hand",
    ", the isovector channel seems to provide a better probe as it contributes near the tail region of the two pion annihilation contribution .",
    "it should be stressed here that broadening or dropping @xmath7 meson mass would even favor our observation . in that case",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath3 background would be pushed more towards lower invariant mass region bringing the @xmath8 peak into a clearer relief . finally , it is important to realize that mixing effects only appear in the longitudinal part of the vector meson spectral function and therefore there should be no effect of the mixing on the photon spectra which involves the transverse part of the vector meson polarization tensor .",
    "the effects studied here are density driven and can therefore be observed in environments where one has high baryonic chemical potential and comparatively lower temperature . the most relevant experiments to observe this kind of medium - induced phenomenon are the ones to be performed at gsi using the hades detector where the density might reach up to three times the normal nuclear matter density and temperature t=60 - 90 mev @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite also indicates a similar range of densities and temperatures at sis / gsi energies .",

    "it is important to proceed cautiously . as a next step",
    ", it would be necessary to address this problem with the full machinery of finite temperature many - body theory .",
    "this means , among other things , the dressing of the propagators and the consistent inclusion of baryonic resonances .",
    "also , the interaction zone in a heavy collision is but a transient medium and the dynamics will contribute to mask our signal to some extent .",
    "however , owing to the nature of the electromagnetic signal , radiation from the dense regions will emerge . in our approach",
    "those dynamics would impact on the height of the @xmath8 peak .",
    "similarly , a realistic assessment of the initial states of the dilepton - producing channels should involve a realistic simulation .",
