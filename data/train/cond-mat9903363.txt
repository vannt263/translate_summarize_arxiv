    "the recent experimental success in synthesizing quasi - one - dimensional ladder materials with a mobile charge carriers has raised an increased interest in the theoretical understanding of their rich phase diagram @xcite , @xcite . in previous studies of microscopic models on various ladder geometries ,",
    "a competition between superconducting , phase separation and density wave instabilities has been observed @xcite , @xcite . in particular , it was seen that ladders with even and odd number of legs have quite distinct generic features , such as the presence of a spin gap at half - filling in even leg system and its absence for odd - leg ladders .",
    "when examining this half - filled case it was realized that inter - band scattering processes are relevant , and that this is the reason why approximations based on strong coupling anisotropies , such as expansions in @xmath8 , give a correct physical picture which extends beyond the isotropic regime .",
    "furthermore , most ladder materials show coupling anisotropies within the ladder complex , _ e.g. _ a recent structural analysis of the vanadate ladder @xmath9 suggests a strong rung - coupling anisotropy of @xmath10 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further explore the strong rung - coupling limit of the @xmath0 model in the presence of mobile holes on a three - leg ladder ( fig.1 ) .    by comparing the results in this analytically tractable limit with numerical diagonalizations",
    ", we will see how far this analysis can be extended towards the regime of isotropic coupling parameters .",
    "we arrive at a phase diagram valid in the limit @xmath11 . at @xmath12",
    "it contains three various luttinger liquid ( ll ) phases of different nature , depending on the concentration of holes . for @xmath13 at low hole doping , there is also a ll phase .",
    "however beyond a critical hole concentration a spin gap opens up , and a transition occurs to a luttinger - emery liquid ( lel ) with an effective hole - hole attraction , as it has already been observed in previous studies of the isotropic case ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the anisotropic @xmath0 model on a three - leg ladder is given by    @xmath16    where _ i _ runs over l rungs , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are spin and leg indices .",
    "the first two terms are the kinetic energy ( p is projection operator which prohibits double occupancy ) and the last two exchange couplings @xmath19 act along the legs ( rungs ) .",
    "let us start by discussing the low - energy states of h on a single 3-site rung with 0,1 and 2 holes in the limit where @xmath20 .",
    "they are listed in tab.1 . in this limit ,",
    "the exact ground state of the whole ladder is simply a product of these rung states .",
    "an important symmetry present in the 3-leg ladder is its reflection parity about the center leg , @xmath21 . along with the total spin quantum number , @xmath22 , and its projection , @xmath23",
    ", @xmath21 characterized the symmetry of the ground state vector .",
    "ground state energies and vectors for + a 3-site rung with 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 holes .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     at half filling ( 0 holes ) the ground state is two - fold degenerate ( s=@xmath24 ; s@xmath25 ) , and it has odd parity with respect to reflection about the center leg , @xmath26 . as discussed previously [",
    "6,8 ] , this state behaves as an effective spin -1/2 rung spin , and an inter - rung magnetic coupling @xmath4 between such states introduces the low - energy behavior of a heisennberg afm spin -1/2 chain .",
    "note that first excited state here is also ( @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ) doublet , but it has even reflection parity , @xmath29 , and thus is in a non - bonding configuration .",
    "a second excited state corresponds already to @xmath30 and is irrelevant for our considerations .",
    "the ground state with one hole on a 3-site rung is a singlet ( @xmath31 ) with even parity , @xmath29 .",
    "subsequently , we will consider separately the two regimes of `` strong coupling '' @xmath32 and `` weak coupling '' @xmath33 .",
    "in strong coupling case @xmath34 , while in weak coupling case @xmath35 .",
    "it will be shown later that hole - hole pairing on a rung ( leading to lel ) occurs naturally in the strong coupling limit , while it is absent at weak couplings .",
    "the first excited state corresponds to a nonbonding singlet with @xmath26 , while a second excited state  to an antibonding singlet with @xmath29 .    for 2 holes on a 3site rung",
    ", the ground state is a ( @xmath27 ; @xmath36 ) doublet with @xmath29 .",
    "the first excited state is non - bonding with @xmath26 , while a second excited state is antibonding with @xmath29 again .",
    "so let us compare now in the limit of almost independent rungs ( @xmath20 ) the ground state energies for different configurations . as a result",
    "we obtain :    1 .   for hole concentration",
    "@xmath37 a minimal energy @xmath38 corresponds to a mixture of rungs with one hole and without holes ( fig.2 ) + 2 .   for @xmath39",
    " two configurations are possible : @xmath40 + + + configuration b ) is given by fig.2 and corresponds to the mixture of rungs with one and two holes , while configuration c ) is given by fig.4 and corresponds to the mixture of one and three holes .",
    "finally for @xmath41 there are two possibilities again : @xmath42  is given by fig.4 again while @xmath43  corresponds to a mixture of rungs with 3 and 2 holes ( fig.5 ) + + comparison of @xmath44 and @xmath45 yields : @xmath46 and hence : @xmath47 + as a result : @xmath48 + for @xmath49 in all the region @xmath50 configuration c ) [ 3 + 1 ] holes is realized .",
    "for@xmath51 in the region @xmath52 configuration b ) [ 1 + 2 ] holes is realized , while for @xmath41 configuration d ) [ 3 + 2 ] holes is more beneficial .",
    "( see fig.6 ) +",
    "let us `` switch on '' the next approximation and calculate kinetic energy of rungs delocalization .    to be more specific for [ 0 + 1 ] phase we need to calculate a matrix element which interchange the rung with 0 holes and the rung with 1 hole .",
    "7 )    on electronic language we calculate : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 are electronic operators ; @xmath56    note that large scales @xmath2 and @xmath1 fix the global configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ for given concentration of holes both the number of rungs with 2 electrons and the number of rungs with 3 electrons do not change .",
    "that is why : @xmath57    the calculation of the @xmath58 yields : @xmath59 where @xmath60 - coefficients which enter , respectively , in the eigenvectors of a ground state ( see eq.(3 ) ) and an antibonding state for 2 electrons on the rung .",
    "note that to calculate @xmath58 we used anticommutation relations for fermionic operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 together with a condition which prohibits a double occupancy .      in the language of effective operators : @xmath64    an operator @xmath65 corresponds to the creation on the site @xmath66 of a rung with 3 electrons and simultaneous destruction on the same site of a rung with 2 electrons .",
    "so , we could represent @xmath65 in the following form @xmath67    here an operator @xmath68 creates the rung with 3 electrons and total spin @xmath69 .",
    "hence it has a fermionic nature .",
    "an operator @xmath70 destroys 2 electrons ( an electronic singlet with total spin @xmath71 ) and hence has a bosonic nature .",
    "of course , 2 rungs could not occupy the same place .",
    "it means that they are subject of infinitely strong hubbard repulsion : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "so , in a state [ 0@xmath741 ] holes a system is described by effective hamiltonian : @xmath75    it is 1d fermionic hubbard model with repulsion . we know that it belongs to the universality class of luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "note that a more detailed analysis in case of @xmath76 shows that at densities @xmath77 ( which , in principle , could be smaller than @xmath78 ) we will have a two - band degenerate hubbard model instead of a one band model .",
    "however , this situation will also fall in the universality class of luttinger liquid i.    let us consider now a state [ 2 + 1 ] . here : @xmath79    direct calculation of @xmath58 yields : @xmath80.\\ ] ]      as a result : @xmath82    an effective operator @xmath83 has a fermionic nature again ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "it creates a rung with 1 electron and @xmath69 ( @xmath68 ) , and simultaneously destroys a rung with 2 electrons and @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) . finally :",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85    we again derive a 1d fermionic hubbard model with repulsion .",
    "so a state [ 2 + 1 ] corresponds to llii which describes a motion of a rung with 1 electron in the surrounding of rungs with 2 electrons .",
    "now let us proceed to the case [ 3 + 2 ] ( fig.9 ) .",
    "here @xmath86",
    "it is easy to derive that @xmath87 because this problem is equivalent to the motion of an electron in the empty space .",
    "hence : @xmath88 where @xmath89 - has a fermionic nature again .",
    "( it creates a rung with 1 electron and destroys an empty rung ) . as a result : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a density of rungs with one electron .",
    "hamiltonian ( 11 ) again corresponds to 1d hubbard model with repulsion .",
    "so , it describes lliii where the rungs with 1 electron move in the surrounding of rungs without electrons .    a state [ 3 + 1 ] has quite a different nature .",
    "here @xmath92 ( see fig.10 ) .",
    "since a phase [ 3 + 1 ] is realized only for @xmath93 : @xmath94 .",
    "kinetic energy in this state describes a motion of the rung with 2 electrons in the surrounding of empty rungs .",
    "hence @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a bosonic operator which creates a rung with 2 electrons and destroys an empty rung .",
    "of course , 2 rungs with 2 electrons can not occupy the same place . as a result : @xmath97 @xmath98 and now we have 1d bose - hubbard with strong repulsion .",
    "this model belongs to universality class of luther - emery liquid .",
    "it has a spin gap at half filling and large superconductive fluctuations in a doped case .",
    "when we include a boson rescattering between neighbouring ladders , than a finite @xmath99 arises in the system @xcite .    finally , the phase diagram reads ( fig.11 ) :",
    "in a close analogy with a double exchange model for @xmath100 : @xmath101 - a largest scale ( fm exchange @xmath102 ) forms a local onsite state with @xmath103 and then effectively drops out of the model .",
    "low energy physics ( including phase separation on fm and afm regions ) is governed solely by smaller parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "absolutely the same scenario is realized in our model .",
    "the largest parameters @xmath2 and @xmath104 form the stable configurations lli , llii , lliii , and lel and after that effectively drop out of the model . low - energy physics is governed solely by @xmath4 and @xmath3 .    then , by analogy with fm - polarons formation in double exchange model , we could have in our case either a diluted configuration ( fig.12 ) or a phase - separated state ( clusterization ) ( fig.13 ) .",
    "the clusterized phase was found in @xcite in numerical study of an isotropic regime @xmath106 , @xmath107 ; @xmath108 .",
    "a diluted phase is more beneficial with respect to kinetic energy @xmath109 , while a clusterized phase is more beneficial with respect to magnetic exchange energy between the rungs @xmath110 .",
    "so , in the case of small @xmath111 a diluted phase is more beneficial .",
    "the energy of this state in case of lli reads : @xmath112 here @xmath113 ( where @xmath58 is given by ( 9 ) ) - corresponds to delocalization energy when rungs with one hole occupy the bottom of the band .",
    "@xmath114 -corresponds to a chessboard afm configuration of rungs with 0 holes ( see fig.14 ) .",
    "effective hamiltonian for lli reads : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a rung spin on site @xmath66 .",
    "so , a final effective @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 model .",
    "for @xmath119 it still belongs to the universality class of ll .",
    "there is no spin gap at half - filling . the basic instability for moderate doping is towards sdw - formation @xcite .    for @xmath120 , in total analogy with 2d @xmath0 model",
    ", a bound state appears and model becomes unstable towards superconductivity .",
    "so , for small @xmath121 its role is just :    1 .   to form small energy corrections , 2 .   to change a little bit phase boundaries on a phase diagram : @xmath122^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath123 is a numerical coefficient , 3 .   to introduce in the model effective afm attraction between neighbouring rungs .    as a result",
    "the gross features of phase diagram on fig.11 are conserved .",
    "now let us proceed from the calculations to qualitative arguments . in isotropic case",
    ", besides a tendency towards clusterization @xcite , there is a tendency towards coexistence of ll and lel .",
    "( fermi - bose liquid scenario restated recently in @xcite ) . in strong coupling regime",
    "there is a gap between the bottoms of fermi - gas band and a bose - gas band .",
    "the gap is of the order of @xmath124 . in an isotropic regime",
    "we could overcome this gap due to an increase of @xmath3 @xmath125 and obtain a picture of fig.15 :",
    "in conclusion let us emphasize that    1 .",
    "3-leg ladder possesses both properties of 2-leg ladders and 1d doped spin chains .",
    "2 .   there is a hope that when we increase a number of legs the difference between odd and even numbers will become smaller . in favour of this assumption",
    "is a fact that in 2n - leg ladders spin - gap scales as : @xmath126 3 .",
    "htsc - materials have both properties of two and three leg ladders .",
    "however at @xmath129 @xmath130 there is a spin pseudogap in htsc materials in analogy with 2-leg ladders .",
    "it means that htsc has a long prehistory when we go from half - filling ( @xmath131 ) to an optimal doping values ( @xmath132 ) .",
