    "based on the size of the jump , the feature at higher temperature is consistent with the pm - ho phase transition , while the feature at lower temperature is consistent with the transition from the ho phase into the lmafm phase .",

    "for further increases in fe substitution , the pm - lmafm phase boundary increases to 34  k by _ x _ = 0.7 .",
    "this overall behavior is reminiscent of what was previously observed in the dependence of the ho - lmafm phase boundary on pressure for single crystals of the parent compound uru@xmath2si@xmath2 , indicating that the interpretation of fe substitution as a chemical pressure  @xcite still applies to the single crystals .",
    "the slight depression of the ho phase boundary with x for single crystal specimens may be caused by disorder associated with the fe substitution , in addition to the chemical pressure .",
    "it is clear that for the intermediate levels of fe concentration , _ x _ = 0.8 and 0.1 , there are two distinct phase transitions as observed in the thermal expansion measurements .",

    "<S> thermal expansion , electrical resistivity , magnetization , and specific heat measurements were performed on uru@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 single crystals for various values of the fe concentration _ x _ in both the hidden order ( ho ) and large moment antiferromagnetic ( lmafm ) regions of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the paramagnetic ( pm ) to ho and lmafm phase transitions are manifested differently in the thermal expansion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> for fe concentrations near the boundary between the ho and lmafm phases at @xmath3 @xmath4 0.1 , we observe two features in the thermal expansion upon cooling , one that appears to be associated with the transition from the pm to the ho phase and another one at lower temperature that may be due to the transition from the ho to the lmafm phase . </S>",
    "<S> these two features have not been observed in other measurements such as specific heat or neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the uniaxial pressure derivative of the transition temperature , based on a calculation using thermal expansion and specific heat data , changes dramatically when crossing from the ho to the lmafm phase . </S>"
