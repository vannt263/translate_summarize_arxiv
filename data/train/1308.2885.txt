    "the theory of words studies the structural properties of strings composed from letters of a given alphabet , and provides algorithms for solving diverse problems defined on strings . among the most important motivations of the discipline",
    "is its relevance to computational biology , and more precisely , to the automated analysis of biosequences .",
    "this includes a great variety of problems whose portrayal is beyond the purposes of the present paper .",
    "some avenues of the ongoing research are surveyed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , an important task is identifying certain patterns , motifs , or biologically meaningful features in a given biosequence .",
    "typically , the considered problems are approached using combinatorial techniques such as combinatorial pattern matching and combinatorics on words . in this paper",
    "we instead use a _ geometric _ approach in an attempt to address questions that are important for understanding biological evolution .",
    "a number of past studies have attempted to address by quantitative means the question of what distinguishes biosequences from random sequences . while by its very nature such a goal has been found quite elusive @xcite ,",
    "there is substantial evidence in support of the argument that biosequences feature properties that are typical of random sequences ( for example , near - total incompressibility @xcite ) .",
    "thus , biosequences are regarded as  slightly edited random sequences \" @xcite , and modern proteins are believed to be  memorized \" ancestral random polypeptides which have been slightly modified by the evolutionary selection process in order to optimize their stability under specific physiological conditions @xcite .",
    "biosequences appear to be hardly distinguishable from their random permutations , although the latter are clearly incongruous with living organisms @xcite .",
    "while this may seem quite obvious from a biological point of view , there have also been numerous computational arguments that support this claim .",
    "for example , in @xcite pande et al .",
    "present results of mapping some protein sequences onto so - called brownian bridges , which revealed a certain deviation from randomness . in another study , by estimating the differential entropy and context - free grammar complexity , weiss et al .",
    "have shown that the complexity of large sets of non - homologous proteins is lower than the complexity of the corresponding sets of random strings by approximately 1 % @xcite . as a first major result of the present work ,",
    "we introduce simple geometric criteria by which biosequences very strongly differ from random sequences of the same length . in view of the above - mentioned 1% difference demonstrated in @xcite , by  very strongly \" we refer to differences in the order of several hundred percent , registered for 25 biosequences compared to random sequences over the same alphabet and length .",
    "furthermore , provided the widely adopted postulates of the theory of evolution and in view of the available theoretical and experimental results , it is natural to conjecture that in the evolutionary process of organisms from primitive to biologically complex , their corresponding biosequences have been evolving from random or close to random toward ones that feature increasing deviation from randomness . as a second major result , our experiments based on the introduced measures confirm this expectation ( although not in equally indisputable terms as for the comparison between random sequences and biosequences ) .",
    "that is also in accordance with results suggesting that biosequences of proteins which are close in the genome are more similar than those of proteins far apart in the genome .    to this end",
    ", we use a discrete geometric approach . given a string @xmath0 over an alphabet @xmath1 with @xmath2 , we define an ordered set @xmath3 of points which form a discrete monotone path in @xmath4 .",
    "we then define the deviation of such a monotone path from linearity , and state some basic properties related to this notion .    after introducing several deviation measures ,",
    "we apply them to the biosequences of a set of organisms that stand at different levels of the evolution scale ( i.e. , from primitive organisms such as microbes , through plants and reptiles , up to mammals ) .",
    "we also compare all these with random sequences of the same length .",
    "the obtained results demonstrate a significant difference between biosequences and random sequences ",
    "the former being much further from linearity than the latter  as well as a general trend of increasing deviation from linearity between primitive and biologically complex organisms .",
    "results of some other related experiments are outlined as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce some technical notions and notations , including ones from the theory of words . in section",
    "3 we introduce the notions of string linearity and deviation from linearity , and study several related properties . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we present our experimental results and offer a short discussion .",
    "we conclude with final remarks and open questions in section 6 .",

    "normalization _ of @xmath13 is obtained by multiplying each value in @xmath13 by @xmath15 where @xmath16    given an approximation algorithm @xmath17 for a minimization problem @xmath18 with a set of instances @xmath19 , let @xmath20 be the value of an approximate solution to instance @xmath21 found by @xmath17 .",
    "the _ approximation ratio _ of @xmath17 on @xmath21 is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the optimal solution for @xmath21 ; the _ worst case performance ratio _ of @xmath17 is @xmath24 .",

    ", the terms word , sequence , and string are often used interchangeably .",
    "a _ sequence _ is often defined in mathematics as a function whose domain consists of a set of consecutive integers , and a _ string over x _ , where @xmath1 is a finite set , is often defined as a finite sequence @xmath26 of elements from @xmath1 ( @xmath1 is also sometimes called the _ alphabet _ ) .",
    "the term _ word _ is frequently used as an abstraction of the other two terms . in biology , the prevalent term is _ biosequence _ ; biosequences are built from the four letters a , t , c , g , and have finite length .",
    "the theory of words is a central topic in theoretical computer science @xcite .",
    "below , we recall a few basic notions and fix some denotations to be used in this paper .    in string @xmath0 over set @xmath1 , @xmath27 is the @xmath28 term of @xmath26 ( @xmath29 ) , which is some element of @xmath1 .",
    "the number of elements in @xmath26 is called the _ length _ of @xmath26 and denoted @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 , we say that @xmath26 is the _ empty string _ , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "we denote @xmath33 consecutive repetitions of term @xmath7 in string @xmath26 by @xmath34 .    if @xmath26 and @xmath35 are two strings , the string consisting of @xmath26 followed by @xmath35 , written @xmath36 , is called the @xmath37 of @xmath26 and @xmath35 .",
    "a @xmath38 of a string @xmath26 is obtained by selecting some or all consecutive elements of @xmath26 .",
    "more formally , a string @xmath39 is a substring of the string @xmath26 if there are strings @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that @xmath42 ( where we may have @xmath43 or @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) .",
    "following the terminology introduced in @xcite , given a string @xmath26 , a _ subsequence _ of @xmath26 is any string @xmath40 which can be obtained by removing from @xmath26 one or more , not necessarily consecutive terms .",
    "to present our approach , we conform to a digital geometry setting in which the considerations take place in the _ grid cell model_. in this model , the regular orthogonal grid defines a partition of @xmath46 into @xmath47-dimensional hypercubes ( e.g. , unit squares for @xmath48 , unit cubes for @xmath49 ) also called _ n - cells _ or _ voxels_. the @xmath47-cells are centered at the grid points and their edges are parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "let @xmath50 be a string on an alphabet @xmath51 .",
    "we inductively construct an ordered set @xmath52 of points @xmath53 corresponding to string @xmath26 as follows .",
    "we set @xmath54 to be the origin of the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath55 be the @xmath28 element of @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58 for some @xmath59 @xmath60 , then we set @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we obtain a _ monotone _ discrete path @xmath52 with @xmath62 , in which the coordinates of a point are pairwise greater than or equal to the corresponding coordinates of any preceding point .",
    "fig . 1 , left , gives an example of a string over the alphabet @xmath63 and its corresponding monotone discrete path .     and its corresponding monotone discrete path .",

    "right : another string which has nearly the same @xmath64 and @xmath65 as @xmath26 , but a different @xmath66.,title=\"fig : \" ]    having such a discrete path constructed , one can study its geometric and combinatorial properties , which in turn can provide useful information about the original string @xmath26 . clearly , the properties and characteristics of monotone discrete paths , not necessarily representing strings , could be interesting in their own right .",
    "let @xmath54 be the origin and @xmath67 be a point in @xmath47-dimensional space @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath68 the set of all monotone discrete paths between @xmath54 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath70 each path @xmath71 consists of @xmath72 points , with initial point @xmath54 and terminal point @xmath69 .",
    "if for every point @xmath73 in @xmath74 , the voxel centered around @xmath73 intersects the line segment @xmath75 , we call @xmath74 a _ linear path_. accordingly , we call a string _ linear _ if its corresponding monotone path is linear .",
    "it is easy to see that the following facts hold :    given a line segment @xmath75 , there is at least one linear path from @xmath54 to @xmath69 .    if @xmath74 is a linear path from @xmath54 to @xmath69 , then @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "next we define some string characteristics that are instrumental to the experimental studies presented in the subsequent sections .",
    "let @xmath26 be a string and @xmath78 be its corresponding monotone path .",
    "we define the _ maximum deviation of @xmath26 from linearity _ as @xmath79 and _ average deviation of @xmath26 from linearity _ as @xmath80    [ r1 ] note that when @xmath81 ( which is the case for biosequences ) , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 of a linear string are at most 1 .",
    "the third characteristic of a string @xmath26 will be called the _ number of local maxima _ of @xmath26 and denoted @xmath82 . formally , by a local maximum",
    "we mean a point @xmath83 for which @xmath84 is greater than @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , regarding the usual applications of extrema of discrete functions , in particular in view of our own purposes , counting all such maxima does not seem to be very relevant . instead",
    ", local maxima can be counted only if they  stand out \" compared to other ,  indistinguishable \" local extrema , which differ very little from neighboring points .",
    "thus , we adopt the notion of number of local maxima as  method dependent . \"",
    "specifically , our choice of method is the one provided by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 measure may be useful to distinguish between strings which have the same @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , right .      our definition of a linear string refers to a discrete monotone path whose voxels intersect the line segment between the initial and terminal points . respectively ,",
    "deviation from linearity refers to the distances from the points of the monotone path to the line segment .",
    "another possible approach is to consider a straight line that minimizes the maximal distance over all points of @xmath52 , which is the axis of the minimum enclosing cylinder for the set @xmath52 .",
    "note that while in two dimensions the problem of finding the minimum enclosing cylinder can efficiently be solved in linear time , it is not so in higher dimensions .",
    "even in 3d , the available exact algorithms take super - cubic time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the problem practically intractable for strings of considerable size , e.g. , like the biosequences we investigate in the following sections .",
    "the following proposition demonstrates that the deviation from linearity which we adopt is no more than twice greater than the one defined by the minimum enclosing cylinder .",
    "moreover , the computation of the former requires only a linear number of operations for a fixed dimension @xmath47 ( 4 in the case of biosequences ) , and is therefore without a doubt advantageous from a computational complexity perspective . note also that in the course of our experiments , we measured a significant difference between the deviation from linearity of biosequences and random sequences ; thus , a minimum enclosing cylinder approach  provided that one could afford to wait for the solution  would provide no advantage in distinguishing biosequences from random sequences aside from changing the magnitude of distinction by at most a factor of 2 .",
    "let @xmath87 be a monotone discrete path of length at least 3 .",
    "a 2-approximation to a minimum enclosing cylinder for @xmath56 can be found with @xmath88 operations .",
    "[ prop ]    * proof * let @xmath89 be the straight line through the first and the last points of path @xmath56 , which is the axis of an enclosing cylinder for @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a point of @xmath56 which maximizes the distance to @xmath89 and denote @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath91 be an enclosing cylinder for @xmath56 of minimal radius @xmath92 centered about an axis @xmath93 .",
    "we have @xmath94 , as the second inequality holds form the following argument .",
    "let @xmath95 be the foot of the perpendicular from @xmath69 to @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath96 . by the construction of path @xmath56 and plain geometric arguments",
    ", we have that a minimal enclosing cylinder @xmath97 for the three points @xmath98 , and @xmath69 has axis @xmath99 that is parallel to line @xmath89 and passes through the midpoint of segment @xmath100 ; obviously , the radius @xmath101 of @xmath97 satisfies @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 and thus @xmath105 .",
    "the estimate of the time necessary to compute @xmath25 follows from related calculus formulas .",
    "let @xmath89 have a parametric equation @xmath106 , where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and let point @xmath109 be as defined above .",
    "@xmath109 belongs to @xmath89 , so @xmath110 for some @xmath111 .",
    "vector @xmath112 is orthogonal to vector @xmath113 , i.e. , their scalar product satisfies @xmath114 . from the last equality one easily obtains @xmath115    obviously , @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be found with @xmath118 arithmetic operations and a single square root computation ; the latter is not necessary to perform when comparing distances from points of @xmath56 to line @xmath89 .",
    "the notion of string linearity furnishes an easily implementable tool to compare the biosequences of various organisms .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that biologically complex organisms have highly structured dna whose corresponding monotone path strongly deviates from a straight line , while primitive organisms have less structured dna , whose corresponding monotone path is closer to a straight line .",
    "moreover , a completely random sequence over the alphabet @xmath119 has no structure , and therefore its corresponding monotone path can be expected to be much closer to a straight line .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we compare the deviation from linearity of the biosequences of 25 organisms with varying biological complexity , as well as that of random sequences .",
    "the number and type of organisms we consider is typical of comparative analysis studies in molecular biology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we took the biosequences from the genome - scale repository and browser ensembl genomes , which is managed by the european bioinformatics institute . for each organism , we processed relatively short substrings and subsequences of dna in fasta format , selected randomly from an excerpt of the genome containing about two million letters . ideally , it might be more informative to select samples from larger excerpts of the genomes , or even to process the entire genomes of organisms at once , since the ( absolute ) deviation from linearity of a string is generally dependent on its length .",
    "in our experimental study we first studied the effects of string size on the proposed linearity measures and then selected a suitable string size for our more extensive experiments .",
    "this helped save computation time and in turn allowed us to repeat each procedure 1,000 times with different samples of the studied genomes , thus increasing the confidence in the obtained results . note that some organisms genomes have billions of letters ( whose processing would require a lot of time ) , while others have genomes that are still uncharted or studied only partially .",
    "thus , we operated under the assumption that a comparison of the linearity of samples of the genomes of a certain reasonable size , that is  comparatively small \" but  sufficiently large \" , will classify organisms in the same _ relative _ order as a comparison of the linearity of their whole genomes . as we will see in the following section , our experiments support this claim .",
    "recall also that we distinguish between substrings and subsequences of a given string @xmath26 , the former being segments of consecutive terms while the latter being ordered subsets of not necessarily consecutive terms of @xmath26 .",
    "typically , experimental research involving biosequences is based on processing families of substrings rather than subsequences .",
    "only recently , apostolico and cunial attempted to assess (  perhaps for the first time , \" as these authors believe ) the structure and randomness of polypeptides in terms of subsequences satisfying certain conditions @xcite .",
    "as the results obtained therein seem interesting and promising , we performed all our experiments both on substrings and subsequences .",
    "the similarities and differences within both frameworks are presented and discussed in the following sections .",
    "we investigated how the length of a biosequence affects its deviation from linearity , and ascertained that deviation increases with the size of the string .",
    "however , the rate of increase seems to be independent from the _ type _ of organism , and therefore an organism s deviation from linearity _ relative _ to the deviation of other organisms is independent of the length of the biosequences , as long as the length is constant across organisms .",
    "these claims are supported by figure  2 , which shows the absolute and normalized maximum and average deviations from linearity of different organisms measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length .",
    "the top four graphs display the @xmath64 and @xmath65 computed for substrings , and the bottom four graphs display the @xmath64 and @xmath65 computed for subsequences .",
    "the left four graphs display the absolute @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the right four graphs display the normalized @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the graphs on their left . note that the graphs in the two columns are essentially the same , where the normalized graphs in the right column are the result of  pulling up \" the left sides of the graphs in the left column .",
    "and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath65 measured for substrings and subsequences of increasing length.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for all graphs , the substrings and subsequences are taken randomly from the 26 sources listed in table 1 . for the top four graphs ,",
    "the corresponding linearity measures were computed for substrings of length @xmath120 for @xmath121 ; for each of these lengths , the linearity measures were computed for 200 different substrings taken randomly from each of the 26 sources , and the average values of the 200 trials were plotted .",
    "for the bottom four graphs , the corresponding linearity measures were computed for subsequences of length @xmath122 for @xmath123 ; for each of these lengths , the linearity measures were computed for 100 different subsequences taken randomly for each of the 26 sources , and the average values of the 100 trials were plotted .    from figure 2",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath64 and @xmath65 measured from subsequences are more independent of length than @xmath64 and @xmath65 measured from substrings , since there is less crossing between lines in the bottom four graphs .",
    "however , even when measured from substrings , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are principally independent of length , since for any of the lengths examined the organisms are more or less in the same relative position compared to the other organisms .",
    "clearly , as the length of substrings and subsequences approaches 0 , the measures of deviation from linearity will approach 0 , and will be more unstable and unreliable . from the normalized graphs , we notice that the initial fluctuations first disappear around substrings and subsequences of length 50,000 .",
    "for this reason , we carried out our further experiments ( which involve more trials and hence a greater confidence ) with substrings and subsequences of this length .",
    "we used version r2011a of matlab to carry out our computations .",
    "the built - in matlab functions ` randi ` and ` randseq ` were applied to make random selections ; additionally , we used a function called ` peakfinder ` , provided by @xcite , to find local extrema .",
    "our computational process can be broken up into the following components :    1 .",
    "selection of samples 2 .",
    "computation of linearity measures 3 .",
    "compilation and normalization of data      to select a random substring @xmath124 from a larger string @xmath125 , we pick a random integer @xmath126 from the interval @xmath127 $ ] using matlab s ` randi ` function ; then , we set @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "in this manner , we select substrings from each of the organisms and store the substrings , which all have length @xmath130 , in an array .",
    "we also store a random sequence of length @xmath130 over the alphabet @xmath119 , generated using matlab s ` randseq ` function , in the array .",
    "similarly , to select a random subsequence @xmath124 from a larger string @xmath125 , we first obtain a list @xmath131 of @xmath130 distinct random integers ranging from @xmath132 to @xmath47 .",
    "we sort the elements of this list in increasing order , and obtain @xmath133 where @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "we then set @xmath136 for @xmath137 .",
    "in this manner , we select subsequences of length @xmath130 from each of the organisms and store them in an array , along with a random sequence of length @xmath130 .    due to the motivation given earlier that fluctuations in the linearity measures first disappear in samples of length 50,000 , we selected substrings and subsequences of length 50,000 from the larger excerpts of genomes .      in order to calculate the maximum and average deviation from linearity for a given string @xmath138 of length @xmath130 , we first count the number @xmath139 of letters @xmath140 in @xmath138 ( where @xmath141 ) .",
    "let @xmath142 be the substring composed of the first @xmath35 letters in @xmath138 , and @xmath143 be the number of letters @xmath140 in the string @xmath142 ( where @xmath144 ) .",
    "we compute the distance @xmath145 from point @xmath146 to the line passing through the origin and @xmath147 for @xmath148 with the formula ( derived from equation ( 1 ) )    @xmath149    we then store the distances @xmath145 , @xmath148 in a list , and find the average and maximum values of this list using elementary techniques , as well as the number of local maxima using the ` peakfinder ` function .",
    "after we have obtained an array of @xmath150 samples ( 25 biosequences and one random sequence ) , we calculate the linearity measures @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for each sample in the array and end up with a @xmath151 array .",
    "we repeat this procedure @xmath152 times with different random samples , and attain a 3-dimensional array ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we then take the average over the @xmath152 trials , and again obtain a 2-dimensional array , which we normalize for each linearity measure in order to better see the relationships between organisms .",
    "thus , our final product is a @xmath151 array with values ranging between 0 and 100 , which allows us to easily compare organisms based on the three linearity criteria .",
    "we repeat the whole procedure twice  once where the samples are substrings of the larger excerpts of genome , and once where they are subsequences .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "in this section we provide further details about our experimental work and discuss the obtained results .",
    "we comment on results which are obvious to our unarmed eye , hoping that other interesting conclusions could also be drawn by experts with higher expertise in biological sciences .",
    ".summary of experimental results [ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      +    the first two columns of table 1 give scientific and common names for the organisms which we have examined .",
    "the specific strains of chlamydia , tuberculosis , gingivalis , and streptococcus are nigg , ccdc5180 , w83 , and nd03 , respectively .",
    "all the dna we processed was from the first chromosomes of the organisms , except for the fruit fly and the yeast , where the dna was taken from chromosomes 2l and 4 , respectively .",
    "columns 3 - 5 of table 1 show the results of our experiments when the @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 were measured for substrings taken from the 25 biosequences and one random sequence .",
    "the last three columns show the results of computing the measures on subsequences instead of substrings .",
    "all measures were computed on samples of length 50,000 and are the average of 1,000 trials .",
    "note that for most species , @xmath64 and @xmath65 measured from substrings differ by less than 1% ; only for four organisms this difference is more than 2% , but no more than 4.2% .",
    "when measured from subsequences , the difference between @xmath64 and @xmath65 is not always small ; although for most species it is less than 2% , for 6 organisms the difference is more than 4% , and for a few  as much as 10% or 20% .",
    "this observation is also supported by figure 2 , which shows that the @xmath64 graphs are nearly identical in appearance to the @xmath65 graphs  where the difference is slightly more noticeable in the cases where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are computed over subsequences .",
    "we suppose that when subsequences rather than substrings are analyzed , some of the structure of the dna is lost and the results are not as precise .",
    "however , as mentioned above , subsequences are slightly more independent of the length of the sample .",
    "when substrings are analyzed the entire structure of the dna is preserved and taken into consideration , so linearity measures computed over substrings seem to be more informative .    as can be seen from the fifth and eighth columns of the table , the @xmath66 measure is useful for distinguishing between random sequences and biosequences , but not as good for classifying organisms in terms of biological complexity .",
    "our first important conclusion is the distinction between the linearity of biosequences and random sequences .",
    "all of our experiments show that biosequences have a higher average and maximum deviation from linearity than random sequences .",
    "when substrings are analyzed , this difference is very significant . in particular , in table 1 ,",
    "the normalized @xmath64 and @xmath65 for random sequences are both 12.8 , whereas the normalized @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the organism with the smallest deviation are 29.3 and 29.7 , respectively .",
    "when subsequences are analyzed , the difference is not as substantial , but random sequences still have a smaller average and maximum deviation from linearity than any of the organisms considered .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by figure 2 , where in the top four graphs ( which are computed over substrings ) , the line positioned visibly below the others is the one representing the random sequence . in the bottom four graphs ( which are computed over subsequences ) ,",
    "the lowest line is again the one representing the random sequence , but the difference is not as significant .",
    "the criterion of @xmath66 presents an even more sizeable difference between random sequences and biosequences .",
    "again , the difference is larger when substrings are considered : the normalized @xmath66 for random sequences is 100.0 , whereas the normalized @xmath66 for the organism with the largest number of local maxima is 39.8 . computed over subsequences ,",
    "the normalized @xmath66 for random sequences is again 100.0 , and the largest number of local maxima for an organism is 96.2 .",
    "our experiments also support the hypothesis that the sequences of primitive organisms are closer in linearity to random sequences than the sequences of biologically complex organisms . as most primitive organisms ,",
    "we consider bacteria and microscopic organisms ; we consider plants the next most evolved organisms , followed by fish , reptiles , and other egg - laying vertebrates . finally , we consider mammals and primates as organisms at the top of the evolutionary ladder .",
    "we expected that the graded change in the magnitude of deviation from linearity of different organisms would be in accordance with the aforementioned classification of their biological complexity .",
    "indeed , our experiments support this expectation .    in particular , when measured over substrings , the human , neanderthal , gorilla , and chimpanzee have the highest @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; the bacterium chlamydia has the smallest @xmath64 and @xmath65 after the random sequence .",
    "the other organisms with the lowest deviations from linearity are two other bacteria , the yeast , sea squirt , and lizard . in the mid - low range are organisms like the fruit fly , medaka fish , and soybean plant , and in the mid - high range are organisms like the zebrafish , chicken , and mouse .",
    "another interesting observation is that primates have a lower @xmath66 than other animals . aside from that , the @xmath66 measure is not as useful as the other measures for classifying organisms by biological complexity ; a weak inverse relationship exists between @xmath66 and biological complexity , especially when @xmath66 is measured from substrings .    when subsequences are considered some of the structure of the dna is inadvertently lost , so the results are not as consistent with expectation .",
    "however , many similar trends can be seen in the last three columns of table 1 as well .",
    "primates generally have the highest deviation from linearity , while bacteria like tuberculosis and gingivalis have among the lowest deviations from linearity .",
    "other organisms of medium biological complexity span the intermediate values of the linearity measures .    in all considerations , some anomalies and incongruences with expectation are manifested .",
    "for example , when measured over substrings , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 of rice and corn are relatively high  higher , for example , than the @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the mouse and rat .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that small rodents are perhaps more ancient organisms than certain plants and have not undergone significant evolution in millions of years .",
    "in this paper we introduced a geometric approach for string analysis based on the notions of string linearity and deviation from linearity .",
    "our experiments showed that , unlike some other criteria , ours strongly separate random sequences from biosequences , as well as primitive from biologically complex organisms .",
    "these results are in accordance with certain earlier interpretations that biosequences have been evolving towards energy minimization in physical terms , as well as of lowering their information complexity @xcite .",
    "as the proposed quantitative measures seem to be quite robust and reliable in practice , important future tasks are seen in performing systematic extensive experiments on a larger set of biosequences , their interpretation and deeper analysis from a biological point of view , and comparison with results obtained by other approaches .",
    "in addition to a more extensive study of the general trends exhibited in the present work , possible future tasks can pursue understanding the meaning and functions ( from a biological point of view ) of biosequence locations where deviation from linearity achieves local maxima or minima .",
    "certain anomalies from the general trends featured by the experiments could also be addressed ",
    "for example , the higher deviation from linearity of certain plants compared to those of rodents .",
    "our study was meant to be a pilot one rather than exhaustive .",
    "it was intended to provide initial tests of the proposed approach and to serve as a prelude to a more complete interdisciplinary investigation , involving specialists who are better equipped to carry out large - scale experiments and interpret the results .    as a final remark , we believe that the introduced approach could be applied to other areas where string comparison is relevant  for instance in comparing the structure of natural languages or diverse encoding schemes .",
