    "in recent years , a twofold interest has attracted theoretical , numerical , and experimental investigations to understand the behavior of nonlinear oscillators .",
    "theoretical ( fundamental ) investigations reveal their rich and complex behavior , and the experimental ( self - excited oscillators ) describes the evolution of many biological , chemical , physical , mechanical , and industrial systems @xcite .",
    "the interest devoted to chaos by many scientist is due to the fact that this new phenomenon appears in various fields , from mathematics , physics , biology , and chemestry , to engineering , economics and medecine .",
    "consequently , there are many opportunities for application of chaos .",
    "for example , in physics chaos has been used to refine the understanding of planetory orbits , to reconceptualize quantum level processes , and to forecast the intensitynof solar activity . in engineering ,",
    "chaos has been used in bulding of better digital filters , and to model the structural dynamics in such structures as buckling columns . in medecine",
    ", it has been used to study cardiac arrhythmias and patterns of disease communication . in psychology",
    ", it has been used to study mood fluctuations , the operation of the olfactory lobe during perception , and partterns of innovation in organizations . in economics",
    "it is being used to find patterns and develop new types of econometric model for the stack market to variations in coton prices .",
    "there are also many opportunities for exploitation of chaos : synchronized chaos , mixing with chaos , encoding information with chaos , anti - control of chaos , tracking of chaos and targetting of chaos .",
    "an important class of systems in general and in particular oscillators who presented a complex or chaotic behavior can be determined on the basis of nonlinear damping .",
    "such damping can , in some systems , change the sign depending on velocity or displacement values , and provide excitation energy to the examined system .",
    "these , so called , self - excited damping terms are often used to describe systems with dry friction , bearings lubricated by a thin layer of oil , shimming in vehicle wheels or chatter in a cutting process @xcite , @xcite-@xcite and @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have studied with considerable detail the effects of the damping level on the resonance response of the steady - state solutions and in the basin bifurcation patterns of the escape oscillator .",
    "in particular they analyzed the effect of using different damping levels and how this contributes to the erosion of the safe areas in phase space , and they also provide a comprehensive global picture of the main bifurcation boundaries .",
    "more recently such a nonlinear damping force has also been considered @xcite in modelling of a modern vehicle suspension system due to electro- or magneto - rheological fluid damping where it is causing a hysteretic effect . in this model",
    "@xcite the authors used a self - excited term of the rayleigh and the duffing type with a double well potential .",
    "parametric excitation occurs in a wide variety of engineering application ( refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) . in this vein",
    ", we propose to study in this paper regular and chaotic behavior of the modified rayleigh - duffing oscillator whose equation is the form eq . ( [ eq.0 ] ) .",
    "this equation which having nonlinear dissipative terms and parametric excitation term can be used to model some systems such as brusselator , selkov , rolling response , certain @xmath0 systems ...",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the model .",
    "section 3 deals with the amplitude of the forced harmonic oscillatory states , using the harmonic balance method @xcite .",
    "section 4 addresses the phase portraits , largest lyapunov exponent and the bifurcation diagrams from which a concluding remark can be made in connection to the tendency of the system to have quasiperiodic , nonperiodic evolutions and chaotic one according to the choice of initial conditions which match with the basin of attraction found .",
    "the last section devoted to the conclusion will point out the contribution of nonlinear damping therms and parametric excitation term which modified ordinary rayleigh - duffing oscillator in both regular and chaotic behaviour of oscillations of this system .",
    "in this paper , we consider following modified rayleigh - duffing oscillator .",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are parametrs .",
    "physically , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent respectively pure , unpure cubic and pure , unpure quadratic nonlinear damping coefficient terms , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the amplitudes of the parametric and external periodic forcing , and @xmath8 and @xmath3 are respectively natural and external forcing frequency . moreover @xmath9 characterize the intensity of the nonlinearity and @xmath10 is the nonlinear damping parametr control .",
    "the nonlinear damping term corresponds to the modified rayleigh oscillator , while the nonlinear restoring force corresponds to the duffing oscillator .",
    "this oscillator is used to modelize the following phenomena : a el ni@xmath11o southern oscillation @xmath12 coupled tropical ocean - atmosphere weather phenomenon in which the state variables are temperature and depth of a region of the ocean called the thermocline ( where the annual seasonal cycle is the parametric excitation and the model exhibits a hopf bifurcation in the absence of parametric excitation ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) , a @xmath0 device consisting of a @xmath13 diameter silicon disk which can be made to vibrate by heating it with a laser beam resulting in a hopf bifurcation ( where the parametric excitation is provided by making the laser beam intensity vary periodically in time ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the rolling response ( @xcite-@xcite ) etc . for examples ,",
    "the nonlinear ship rolling response and nonlinearly damped universal uscape oscillator can be rewritten as follow : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nonlinear damping and @xmath16 restoring coefficients .",
    "+ in the ship rolling case , a. francescutto and g. contento @xcite are used experimental results and parameter identification technique to study bifurcations in ship rolling , application of the extended melnikov s method are used by w. wu and l .",
    "mccue @xcite de for single - degree - of - freedom vessel roll motion . in the other hand miguel a. f. sanjun ( in ref.@xcite ) analyzed the effect of nonlinear damping on the universal escape oscillator .",
    "another examples , consider the modified rayleigh - duffing oscillator equation which describes the glycolytic reaction catalized by phosphofructokinase , namely the selkov equations and abstract trimolecular chemical reaction namely brusselator oscillator @xcite : + one of these processes is simple classical two - variable model which describes glycolytic reaction catalized by phosphofructokinase , namely the selkov equations    @xmath17    and another is the brusselator which describes an abstract trimolecular chemical reaction @xmath18 for the selkov model @xmath19 , where @xmath20 for the brusselator @xmath21 and @xmath22 in both cases @xmath23 is a deviation from the equilibrium concentration . with these conditions , the two last systems can been rewritten @xmath24    perturbing this system by duffing force , parametric excitation force and external sinusodal forced , we obtained the parametric dissipative modified rayleigh - duffing oscillator which is expressed by eq .",
