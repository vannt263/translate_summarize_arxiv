    "the evolution of intermediate and low  mass stars in binary systems is a complex subject that has , however , enormous importance in astrophysics . of their way to the final end , a bulk of information is available from observations on the processes undergone by binaries as they evolve , i.e. common  envelope phases , accretion , outburst .",
    "a relevant new piece of information comes from the consideration of the number of type ia supernova explosions ( sneia ) that occur per unit mass spent in forming stars in different environments .",
    "so far , the exploration of the issue was restricted to nearby galaxies , where the combination of sneia statistics with star formation rate ( sfr ) history is poorly known .",
    "the approach explored here is to take the average of star formation history in redshift space and use the information on cosmic sneia rate to infer how many stars in binaries from low to intermediate mass end up as sneia .",
    "this indirect approach started a few years ago ( ruiz  lapuente , burkert , & canal 1995 ; ruiz  lapuente , canal , & burkert 1997 ; see also madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ; sadat et al .",
    "1998 ; ruiz  lapuente & canal 1998 ; yungelson & livio 1998 , 2000 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1998 ; dahlen & fransson 1999 ; ruiz  lapuente , cass , & vangioni  flam 2000 ) and it can help us to determine the nature of the progenitors of sneia .",
    "we evaluate the number of sneia exploding per unit comoving volume , in redshift space , and relative to the mass going into forming stars in the universe . despite the uncertainties still involved",
    ", the last years have nevertheless brought some crucial information .    as we will see , if the efficiency of binaries in ending as sneia is 6% of the stars between @xmath0 , no other alternative than the single degenerate scenario appears as a reasonable candidate to explain those explosions .",
    "the modeling on which that conclusion is based stands comparison with the statistics of the white dwarf ( wd ) pairs actually observed .",
    "in the last few years we have started to learn about the cosmic history of the star formation process , and several groups ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ; steidel et al . 1998 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ; blain et al .",
    "1999 ) have begun to derive the global star formation rate @xmath4 . at the same time , the first measurements of the global sneia rates , @xmath5 , are being performed ( pain et al .",
    "1996 ; hardin et al .",
    "2000 ; hamilton 1999 ; hamuy & pinto 1999 ; pain et al . 2000 ) . the sneia rate is doubly related to the sfr : through the time delay between formation of the sneia progenitor systems and explosion , and through the fraction of stars ( binaries in this case ) that give rise to sneia .",
    "the comparison between @xmath4 and @xmath5 thus contains key information on the nature of the so far elusive sneia progenitors .    the work of madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , based on the uv luminosities of galaxies in the hubble deep field , complemented that of lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) at optical wavelengths in showing that the star formation activity steadily increases with @xmath6 from the local , present ",
    "day universe , up to @xmath7 .",
    "the original claim that @xmath4 peaks there to fall again at higher @xmath6 has later been revised , in particular on basis to data at long wavelengths that would indicate that the star formation regions at high @xmath6 are enshrouded in dust ( see hughes et al .",
    "1998 , for instance ) .",
    "@xmath4 would level  off beyond @xmath8 , up to much higher redshifts .",
    "observations in the submillimeter range ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) , iso measurements of the extragalactic background light ( rowan  robinson et al . 1997 ; flores et al . 1998 ; elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the firas and dirbe experiments on board of cobe ( dwek et al . 1998 ; fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ) , do in principle lift the veil on the star formation activity in dust ",
    "obscured regions , but there is no redshift identification of the emission detected .",
    "measurement of the sn rates at high @xmath6 then would help to trace the star formation history .",
    "sneia are the most luminous ones .",
    "thus , knowledge of the characteristic time delays between formation of their progenitor systems and explosion is most relevant .",
    "the measurements of the cosmic evolution of the sneia rate now extend up to @xmath9 , and there are already preliminary results for @xmath10 .",
    "current results are summarized in table 1 . by combining our knowledge of @xmath5 with that of @xmath4",
    ", we can now gain new insight on the nature of the sneia progenitor systems .",
    "we introduce for that the `` efficiency '' @xmath11 of sneia production referred to the sfr , both per unit of comoving volume :    @xmath12    the quantity @xmath11 ( given in the fourth column of table 1 ) is thus just the number of sneia per unit mass spent in forming stars at a given @xmath6 , and it is independent from the cosmological model assumed .",
    "this efficiency reflects the evolutionary time scale ( from birth to explosion ) of the progenitor systems and the range of initial conditions leading to sneia explosions , together with other possible evolutionary effects ( such as dependence on initial metallicity ) .",
    "the dependence on the time scale is illustrated in figure 1 for the two main types of progenitor systems so far proposed , and for three different @xmath4 .",
    "the systems labelled cls(w ) have evolutionary time scales of the order of a few gyr whereas those labelled dd have time scales of the order of a few hundred million years only .",
    "the `` flat '' evolution of the efficiency for the dd systems for decreasing @xmath6 is due to the fact that @xmath5 closely follows @xmath4 . instead , @xmath11 significantly increases towards lower @xmath6 for the cls(w ) systems because the systems now exploding are a fixed fraction of the stars formed a few gyr ago , when @xmath4 was higher .",
    "the flattening of @xmath11 at larger @xmath6 corresponds to a similar flattening of the @xmath4 considered .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath11 reflect the abundance of progenitor systems ( and thus the range of initial conditions leading to sneia ) , and they will be discussed below .",
    "the two types of systems whose @xmath11 is shown in figure 1 have emerged in the last years as the main candidates to sneia progenitors .",
    "the dd systems are binaries made of a couple of co wds with a total mass exceeding the chandrasekhar mass , and close enough to merge due to emission of gravitational waves in less than a hubble time ( webbink 1984 ; iben and tutukov 1984 ) .",
    "the cls(w ) systems consist of a co wd plus a subgiant or red  giant companion that is overfilling its roche lobe and transferring matter from its envelope to the wd ( _ cataclysmic  like system _ or algol  type binary that might be observed as a _ supersoft x  ray source _ ) .",
    "this scenario was originally proposed by whelan & iben ( 1973 ) and recently refined by hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 ) , who introduce the effects of a strong wind emitted by the accreting wd to stabilize mass transfer .",
    "that would allow the wd to reach the chandrasekhar mass by steadily burning h into he and then he into co ( see also nomoto , iwamoto , & kishimoto 1997 ) .",
    "general discussions of the possible sneia progenitor systems can be found in ruiz  lapuente , canal , & burkert ( 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 values in table 1 are based on @xmath13 ( gronwall 1999 ) for the local sfr . for higher @xmath6 ,",
    "we give the average of the values calculated for each of the three different @xmath4 referred to in figure 1 . the low ",
    "redshift efficiencies correspond to 1 sneia per @xmath14 going into star formation . as we see , @xmath11 is of the same order up to @xmath9 .",
    "ongoing searches will soon yield the efficiency at @xmath15 . if we assume that all stars with initial masses @xmath16 produce sneii + sneib / c ( gravitational  collapse sn ) , then @xmath17 , for a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with @xmath18 , extending from 0.1 m@xmath19 up to 100 m@xmath19 . with the above values , that gives about 5 gravitational  collapse sn for every sneia in the local universe ( see table1 ) , in good agreement with the observations .",
    "we can relate @xmath11 to the fraction @xmath20 of stars in the @xmath21 initial mass range that should produce sneia if @xmath5 closely followed @xmath4 , since we would then have :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the imf . for the same imf as above",
    ", we would have @xmath24 , which would mean @xmath25 for the @xmath26 given below .",
    "some @xmath27 of the stars in the above mass range ( making the approximation that all stars were born in binaries ) should thus give rise to sneia .",
    "given the strong selection that any initial population of binaries with primaries in that mass range undergoes in any scenario , at different evolutionary steps , until becoming a sneia candidate , the figure looks high if there is no help from the fact that most systems now exploding were formed at an epoch when @xmath4 was considerably higher than at the redshifts considered here , and it confirms the impression carried by figure 1 that the dd systems , with their short evolutionary timescales adding to the strong evolutionary constraints , do fail to account for the bulk of observed sneia .",
    "we will see in the next section that modeling of the galactic dd population reinforces this conclusion . comparing the measured @xmath28 with that predicted from the dd scenario , at @xmath29 for instance",
    ", one sees that the prediction ( @xmath30 ) is more than @xmath31 below the measurement ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 test gives a probability @xmath34 that the two efficiencies were the same . even allowing for a sytematic error by a factor of 2 in the theoretical prediction of the rates and taking then the upper limit ,",
    "the prediction would still be more than @xmath35 below the observational value ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "if we refer to average values over the interval @xmath37 , then we have , from observations , @xmath38 whereas the dd prediction is @xmath39 , more than @xmath40 below ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "precise enough measurements of @xmath5 at @xmath42 would in turn test the prediction that at those redshifts the decrease in metallicity should inhibit the strong wind mechanism in the cls(w ) systems ( kobayashi et al .",
    "a decrease in @xmath11 should be observed , even if sneia do not completely disappear thanks to the early metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the accuracy of model predictions of the sneia rates expected from the merging of two co wds ( the dd scenario ) can not just be tested against the actually measured rates , since the observed sneia can arise from a different evolutionary pathway . only predicted rates much in excess of the measured ones would prove the modeling wrong .",
    "since we find the efficency of sneia production in the dd scenario to be too low as compared with that observed , some extra test of the general binary evolution model is required .",
    "such a test is provided by the measured space density of binary systems consisting of a pair of wds ( dd systems ) . in the dd scenario ,",
    "a fraction of those systems ( close co wd pairs with a total mass exceeding the chandrasekhar mass and close enough to merge in less than a hubble time ) would be the sneia progenitors .    from existing surveys ,",
    "no clear sneia progenitor candidate has been found among the detected dd systems , but aside from the role played by not too well controlled selection effects , the fact does not automatically validate model predictions that the space density of possible progenitors should be low enough for them to have escaped detection up to now .",
    "a better test is provided by the comparison of model predictions with the sample of dd systems already detected , even if no sneia candidate has yet been found .",
    "we have thus calculated , with the same monte carlo scenario code used to predict the sneia rates for different evolutionary scenarios ( see ruiz ",
    "lapuente , canal , & burkert 1997 , for instance ) , the numbers of different types of dd binaries ( he wd + he wd , co wd + he wd , and co wd + co wd ) that would form at times following an instantaneous burst of star formation .",
    "the formation of wd + ms pairs is also followed .",
    "that is later convolved with a sfr appropriate for the solar neighbourhood ( constant rate , @xmath43 for the whole galactic disk ) , which gives us the number density of dd systems existing at the present time .",
    "since wd pairs older than @xmath44 should haved cooled below detection limits , the local sfr history is not really important when comparing the model with the observations .",
    "we find that the space density of wds with ages below @xmath45 ( wich roughly corresponds to @xmath46 ) should be @xmath47 , which agrees well with the observational estimates of liebert , dahn , & monet ( 1988 ) ( @xmath48 ) .    in table 2",
    "( first line ) we give the predicted fractions of close dd and close wd + ms pairs versus all wds ( single plus both wide and close pairs ) .",
    "we also give the fraction corresponding to the predicted sneia candidates . in the second line",
    "is shown the current birth rate of the three types of systems , and in the third one the numbers of systems with ages below @xmath49 . in the calculations",
    "we have adopted a value of the common envelope parameter @xmath50 .",
    "our results compare well with the observed samples ( saffer , livio , & yungelson 1998 ; maxted & marsh 1999 )",
    ". the predicted dd period and mass distributions do also agree ( see figure 2 ) , especially if we take into account the observational biases against detection of systems with very low mass primaries ( taken here to be the brightest , and thus the more recently formed members of the dd systems ) , and of binaries with either the longest or the shortest periods . therefore , our modeling of the possible dd progenitors of sneia can be considered as being tested against all the currently available observational data , and our conclusion as to the low efficiency of the dd scenario in producing possible sneia progenitors , as compared with the measurements of the cosmic evolution of the sneia rates , appears robust .",
    "we have shown how , by using a cosmic approach , the topic of which stars end their evolution as sneia can be enlightened .",
    "about 6% of the binary stars in the range @xmath0 end their lives as sneia .",
    "this fraction is unattainable from the merging of c+o wd pairs , since only about 1% of binaries with masses in that range have a final total mass which is above the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the high production efficiency of sneia out of the star formation process found from @xmath51 to @xmath3 and beyond suggests that the single degenerate scenario best explains type ia explosions .",
    "the star formation rate is understestimated by a factor of 6 even in the reconstructions from @xmath51 till @xmath3 which give the highest estimates , while the rate of sneia is not underestimated .",
    "this situation seems unlikely as it would imply that the real sfr history is inconsistent with a dozen of empirical determination using very different methods .",
    "in addition , such extremely high sfrs would be in conflict with all we know about extragalactic background light .",
    "more especifically , at @xmath52 there is just a discrepancy by a factor @xmath53 among the sfrs in figure 1 . the bulk of dd systems merging at that @xmath6 were formed at @xmath54 , where the range of possible sfrs is not any broader .",
    "we have overestimated by a factor of 6 the empirical rates of sneia from @xmath51 till @xmath3 .",
    "the possibility of having overestimated the sneia rate is unlikely since critical aspects such as obscuration by dust , or undetectability of sneia near galactic nuclei , should produce the opposite effect .",
