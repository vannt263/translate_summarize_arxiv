    "the force - velocity relation for the case of slow release and unstable states is beyond the capable description of classical mechanics model . however using this quantum hamiltonian",
    ", we can derived a rather brief force - velocity relation for the case of slow release and unstable states .",
    "the quantum equation of motion suggests that the mutual sliding is a source of the decay of excited states .",
    "another source of decay is vacuum fluctuation or thermal fluctuation , we summarize them into a spontaneous decay process .",
    "the mutual sliding movement means breaking bonds and establishing new bonds between two filaments .",
    "the ratio between the life time of the sliding induced decay and spontaneous decay determines the behavior of force - velocity relation . for a quick release ,",
    "the sliding decay is much larger than spontaneous decay . for a slow release , the spontaneous decay dominates .",
    "both the experimental measurement of quick release and slow release only records the behavior of steady states solution . for the non - steady state ,",
    "the force - velocity relation is an oscillating function of time .",
    "there is a difference between the frequency of force oscillation and the input frequency of electric stimulus .",
    "this theoretical conclusion is consistent with biological observation  some insect flight muscle",
    "indeed can oscillate more rapidly than the frequency of input nervous impulse .",
    "we proposed the mathematical definition of the tension of a muscle fibre as the total number of particles in the excited states .",
    "thus tension transients is described as the evolution of the density operator of the excited states .",
    "based on this hypothesis , we apply the conventional quantum two - level model and three - level model to check the tension transients course of muscle fibre .",
    "the quantum two - level model reproduced most of tension - time courses of cardiac muscle under stretch activation .",
    "the three - level model can theoretically generate most curves of the tension transient of insect flight muscle .",
    "the quantum three - level model also produced some tension - time course of rabbit psoas muscle for which the two - level model can not account .",
    "the key difference between three - level model and two - level model is that three - level model takes into account of the induced decay due to metastable state while the two - level model does not .",
    "the quantum three - level model can also generate the tension transients of a skeletal muscle fibre under stimulus of electric pulse .",
    "however we checked the tension transients of skeletal muscle from a different point of view of quantum coherent state .",
    "the tension , the first derivative of tension and the second derivative of tension are all coincide with the third order projection of coherent states .",
    "it is not fully understood in physics why it projects to the third order , maybe there are better ways to model skeletal muscle .    in the muscle stimulus experiment almost 35 years ago@xcite , the tension - time course varies according to the concentration of @xmath245 and @xmath246 . in the quantum chain model ,",
    "those mathematical parameters can varies to produce similar curves to the experiment data . if there are too many theoretical parameters , it is big challenge to understand the physical or chemical relation between the concentration of @xmath245 and @xmath246 and those parameters",
    ". fortunately there are only three effective parameters in the quantum model related to the muscle tension transient : the two decay rates of excited states and the frequency difference between the two excited states .",
    "the decay rates controls the long time behavior of tension transient .",
    "the frequency difference introduces wavy oscillations upon the conventional exponential decay or exponential increase .",
    "it needs a series of systematic experiments to find out how ions control the three parameters , the existed experiment data is not enough .",
    "one experiment fact is that if solution does not contain @xmath245 ions , delayed tension changed disappeared , if the @xmath245 and @xmath246 are added , distinctive tension transients were observed@xcite .",
    "it seems as if @xmath245 ion drive the myosin motor molecule into metastable conformation and transform the molecule into a three - level quantum particle . while @xmath246 seems like to fix the conformation of myosin molecules so that they are invariant under stretch activation .",
    "maybe the ratio between the concentration of @xmath245 and @xmath246 is a possible controller of the two decay rate of the two excited states .",
    "both theoretical and experimental works are required to solve the puzzle .",
    "i did not find the contact information of the author of ref @xcite to ask for the permission of using the experimental curves in my article . if the reader want to see the experimental curve but can not find the old ref .",
    "@xcite in 1977 , please sent me an e - mail .",
    "i will ask the electronic library in max - planck - institute for the physics of complex systems for help .",
    "i present the detail calculations of force - velocity equation here .",
    "the assumptions and approximations used in calculation are explained at every step .",
