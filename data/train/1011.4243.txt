    "koszul rings were introduced in the seminal paper @xcite as graded rings @xmath4 such that : @xmath5 is a semisimple ring , and @xmath5 regarded as a graded left @xmath2-module has a resolution @xmath6 by projective graded left @xmath2-modules , with the property that every @xmath7 is generated by its homogeneous component of degree @xmath8 in loc .",
    "the authors show that many fundamental properties of koszul algebras hold for koszul rings too : koszul rings are quadratic , a ring is koszul if and only if the koszul complex is exact , the dual of a koszul ring is koszul , etc .",
    "it is well - known that the tensor product of two koszul algebras is koszul too , so it is natural to ask if a similar property can be proved for koszul rings . of course , first of all we have to clarify what is meant by the tensor product of two graded rings . in the classical situation ,",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath9 are two koszul algebras , the tensor product is performed over the base field @xmath10 note that in this case both algebras are connected , that is @xmath11 in the general case , when @xmath2 and @xmath9 are just graded rings , it might happen that @xmath12and @xmath13 to be different , so there is no good candidate for the ` base ring ' .",
    "it is easy to overcome this difficulty , by fixing a semisimple ring @xmath0 and dealing only with connected graded @xmath0-rings , that is graded rings with @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently , a connected graded @xmath0-ring is a connected graded algebra in the monoidal category @xmath15 of @xmath0-bimodules .",
    "clearly , if @xmath2 and @xmath9 are connected graded @xmath0-rings , then we may consider the graded @xmath0-bimodule @xmath16 ( throughout the paper the symbol @xmath17 denotes the tensor product of two @xmath0-bimodules ) .",
    "still , @xmath16 do not inherit a ring structure from the existing ones of @xmath2 and @xmath18 as @xmath0 is not commutative .",
    "in noncommutative geometry a good replacement for the usual tensor product of two algebras is the twisted one , with respect to a graded twisting map @xmath19 ( see  [ r - ring ] for the definition of a twisting map and of the corresponding twisted tensor product @xmath20 ) .    in view of the foregoing",
    ", we fix a semisimple ring @xmath0 , two graded @xmath0-rings @xmath2 and @xmath9 and a graded twisting map @xmath21 between @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath9 are koszul , now it makes sense to ask if @xmath22 is koszul as well .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to show that this question has a positive answer , provided that the twisting map is invertible .    to approach this problem we shall use as a main tool the dual notion of @xmath0-rings , the so called @xmath0-corings . by definition , they are coalgebras in the monoidal category @xmath23 our interest for this structure",
    "is explained by the fact that the koszul complex of a quadratic @xmath0-ring @xmath2 may be regarded in a canonical way as a connected graded @xmath0-coring @xmath3 ( here by connected we mean that @xmath24 ) .",
    "moreover , the differentials of the koszul complex may be written by using the multiplication in @xmath2 and the comultiplication in @xmath3 only . in the first part of the paper",
    "we show that something like the koszul complex exists for an arbitrary pair @xmath25 where @xmath2 is a connected graded @xmath0-ring and @xmath3 is a connected graded @xmath0-coring that are compatible in following sense .",
    "first we ask that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are isomorphic as @xmath0-bimodules via a map @xmath28 since both structures are graded , the multiplication in @xmath2 and the comultiplication in @xmath3 induce maps @xmath29 and @xmath30 the second condition that we impose on @xmath2 and @xmath3 is that@xmath31we call such a pair pre - koszul . in the first section of the paper we investigate the main properties of pre - koszul pairs .",
    "we start by associating six complexes to each pre - koszul pair @xmath32 the first one is a chain complex in the category of left @xmath2-module . by symmetry",
    "we obtain another one in the category of right @xmath2-modules , and by combining these constructions we get a new chain complex in the category of @xmath2-bimodules .",
    "the other three complexes are constructed by duality .",
    "thus , they are cochain complexes in appropriate categories of ( bi)comodules .    in the case",
    "when @xmath27 generates @xmath33 we prove that @xmath34 is pre - koszul , where the coring structure on @xmath35 @xmath36 is defined using the normalized bar resolution of @xmath37 again by duality , if @xmath3 is a connected graded @xmath0-coring and @xmath3 is cogenerated in degree one , then @xmath38 is a pre - koszul pair , where @xmath39    in theorem [ thm : koszul ] we prove that one of the six complexes that are associated to a pre - koszul pair @xmath1 is exact , then the other five are also exact . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a koszul pair .    for a graded @xmath0-ring @xmath2 , we prove in theorem [ te : alg - echiv ] that there is a graded @xmath0-coring @xmath3 such that @xmath1 is koszul if and only if @xmath2 is generated by @xmath27 and @xmath34 is koszul , if and only if @xmath2 is a koszul ring .",
    "by duality one proves a similar result for a graded @xmath0-coring @xmath3 .",
    "we end this section by showing that a component of a koszul pair uniquely determines the other one . as a consequence of this fact , @xmath40for any koszul ring @xmath2 and any koszul coring @xmath3 ( see  [ koszul - coring ] for the definition of koszul corings ) .",
    "therefore @xmath41 and @xmath42 may be seen as the koszul dual of @xmath2 and of @xmath43 respectively .",
    "note that these isomorphisms hold without any finiteness condition on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in the third section of the paper",
    "we prove that @xmath20 is koszul , provided that @xmath2 and @xmath9 are koszul , and that the twisting map @xmath21 is invertible . in order to do that",
    ", we consider the koszul pairs @xmath34 and @xmath44 , and show that there is a twisting map @xmath45 such that @xmath46 is a koszul pair .",
