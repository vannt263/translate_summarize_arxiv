    "rare decays of @xmath1 mesons have a great potential as tests of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "processes involving flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are of particular interest given that in the sm they can only proceed via one or more loops .",
    "this leads to very small rates allowing at the same time for possible contributions from high energy scales to produce observable effects .",
    "for instance , in the sm the top quark gives a very important , and actually dominant , contribution to the process @xmath2 .",
    "physics beyond the sm , e.g. involving new heavy particles in the loop , could contribute with comparable effects .",
    "in fact the observation by cleo @xcite of the inclusive @xmath3 transition already constrains the parameter space of many theories @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the process @xmath4 involves additional information on fcnc and is an important complement to @xmath2 in testing the sm .",
    "although there is still no observation of any of these modes , the experimental situation looks very promising both at @xmath5 @xcite as well as hadronic machines @xcite . unlike in @xmath2 , where there are no reliable ways to calculate the hadronic matrix elements in exclusive modes ( e.g. @xmath6 )",
    ", the corresponding quantities in can be safely predicted with the help of heavy quark symmetry @xcite .",
    "the fact that these exclusive modes can be theoretically clean together with the additional information resulting from a richer kinematics , make these decays very interesting both theoretically as well as experimentally . while @xmath2 proceeds via only one operator ,",
    "the @xmath4 processes receive contributions from two additional operators at the weak scale .",
    "this will imply that the information on higher energy scales , encoded in the coefficients of these operators , not only affects the rates but also the shape of the dilepton mass and angular distributions .",
    "these features have been recently pointed out by several authors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we clarify some the issues related to the extraction of hadronic matrix elements in and also show explicitly how different signals probe distinct aspects of the theories beyond the sm . in particular we show the effects of a class of models in which the new physics couples preferentially to the third generation @xcite . in these type of scenarios , the large mass of the top quark is explained by new gauge interactions that are strong with the third generation , but rather weak with the first two . as a consequence ,",
    "the first low energy test of these models is in @xmath1 decays , with the modes the most sensitives . in sec .",
    "[ sd ] we present the short distance structure of @xmath7 .",
    "we emphasize the distinction between theories that respect the sm operator basis and those that expand it .",
    "this will prove to be relevant when studying the phenomenology of decays . in sec .",
    "[ hqs ] we review the relations predicted by heavy quark symmetry that allow reliable predictions of decays in terms of experimental information from other modes . in sect .",
    "[ predictions ] we show the predictions of the sm , a two - higgs doublet extension of it and of topcolor models , in order to compare the signals of these different scenarios .",

    "it is convenient to write down an effective theory at low energies by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "these are the @xmath8 boson and top quark inside the loops in fig .",
    "[ f_bsll ] . in general , in theories beyond the sm there will be additional contributions .",

    "the coefficients at @xmath14 are obtained when their values at @xmath15 are evolved using the renormalization group equation .",
    "this has been done in a partial leading logarithmic approximation in @xcite for the sm as well as for two - higgs doublet models .",
    "the complete leading logarithmic approximation for the sm has been recently computed in @xcite . for the purpose of this paper",
    "it is sufficient to make use of the approximation in @xcite , given that the uncertainties related to long distance dynamics , even when reduced by symmetry arguments ( see next section ) , are still larger than the error made by using it . for a complete discussion see @xcite .",
    "the short distance information is then encoded in the @xmath16 s .",
    "several theories beyond the sm share this operator basis with it .",
    "their extra contributions at the electroweak or higher energy scales appear as changes in the values of the coefficients at @xmath15 .",
    "there are also theories that require an extension of the operator basis .",
    "for instance , the chirality of the quark currents could be reversed , giving    [ w_basis ] o_7= m_b(|s_b_l ) f^[w_basis_1 ] o_8= ( |s_b_r)(|^ ) [ w_basis_2 ] o_9=(|s_b_r)(|^_5 ) [ w_basis_3 ]    as well as the ones resulting from @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "the sm , supersymmetry , multi - higgs models and most technicolor scenarios only modify the value of the short distance coefficients @xmath16 , without inducing additional operators . on the other hand , left - right symmetric models , compositness and topcolor are among the theories capable of inducing sizeable wrong - chirality contributions as well as shifts in the normal - chirality coefficients .",
    "these two very different groups of electroweak symmetry breaking scenarios are likely to give drastically different signals , for instance for the angular distributions .",
    "the only operator entering in @xmath3 at the weak scale is @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , radiative processes have a rather limited power as sm tests : only the shifts induced in @xmath20 are probed .",
    "conversely , processes are more sensitive to new physics which might give small or null deviations of the @xmath2 rate but still give large contributions to the other coefficients in ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "these would produce not only a different rate but also distinct patterns in the dilepton mass distributions as well as the angular distributions .",
    "the use of experimental information in processes requires the theoretical understanding of hadronic effects .",
    "the inclusive rate @xmath21 is theoretically clean in this respect and can be predicted with rather low uncertainties @xcite .",
    "however , its experimental observation might prove to be a very difficult task . on the other hand , exclusive modes like @xmath22 and @xmath23 are more accesible to both @xmath5 and hadronic machines , but the need to compute hadronic matrix elements of the operators in ( [ opbasis ] ) and ( [ w_basis ] ) introduces potentially large hadronic uncertainties .",
    "the situation appears to be similar to the one in @xmath6 , where the large disagreement among model calculations of the matrix element of @xmath19 between @xmath1 and @xmath24 renders this mode almost useless as a test of the sm .",
    "however , in the present case these large uncertainties can be avoided by making use of heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) , which relates the hadronic matrix elements entering in decays to those entering in semileptonic decays @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that we _ do not _ consider the limit in which the @xmath25 quark is heavy , as is done in part of previous work on these decays . in the rest of this section",
    "we review the implementation of these relations and make use of them in exclusive decays .",
    "as we will see below , this mode is the most interesting one from the phenomenological point of view .",

    "this implies large contributions to @xmath151 processes like @xmath152 and @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "the results for can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f_mll2 ] , where the dilepton mass distributions are plotted for the various cases considered above and in the region allowed by the use of the relations ( [ scal_p ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that this mode is not such a powerful test of the sm .",
    "however its observation will be an important complement to the information extracted from .",
    "the results for this decay are summarized in table  ii .",
    "as we have seen in previous sections , the decay is a powerful test of the sm . this is true even when the present experimental situation restricts the reliable predictions of hadronic matrix elements to the region with @xmath154 .",
    "the angular information is likely to be an extremely useful tool given its sensitivity to changes in the short distance coefficients in ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath101 is very large and negative in the sm , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f_as1](a ) and in table  i. this is caused by an accidental partial cancellation in the short - distance factor that makes the helicity @xmath118 to be significantly larger than all the others , causing a large negative value in ( [ afb_hel ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the two - higgs doublet scenario we discussed in sect .",
    "[ predictions ] , with @xmath155 and @xmath156 gev , gives a considerably smaller asymmetry even when the dilepton mass distribution is not very different from that of the sm ( fig .",
    "[ f_mll1](a ) ) .",
    "we have also considered the effects of topcolor models @xcite .",
    "the decays are the first low energy data that could be strongly affected by the phenomenology of these models , which are also expected to produce important effects on top and bottom production @xcite as well as on @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "we have seen in sect .",
    "[ predictions ] that a @xmath158 gev color - singlet boson strongly coupled to the third generation gives large deviations from the sm in both the asymmetry and the dilepton mass distribution , as long as the neutral mixing induced is chosen to be of the same order as the corresponding ckm matrix element as in ( [ sqr_anz ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry ( fig .",
    "[ f_as1](b ) , dashed line ) is largely reduced with respect to the sm value .",
    "this is due not only to shifts in the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 which upset the cancellation taking place in the sm , but also due to non - zero values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the coefficients of the ",
    "wrong \" chirality operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ w_basis ] ) .",
    "the latter implies important contributions to helicity amplitudes that were largely suppressed in the sm .",
    "the sensitivity of the angular information to non - zero values of these coefficients is illustrated in the case @xmath159 tev .",
    "there , the dilepton mass distribution ( fig .  [ f_mll1](b ) , dotted - dash line ) is not very different from the sm prediction .",
    "however , the asymmetry is still substantially smaller , as can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ f_as1](b ) .",
    "although is true that reliable predictions for the hadronic matrix elements are presently limited to large dilepton masses , this might not be such an important limitation regarding the quality of the angular information .",
    "the availability of @xmath49 data will allow sm tests for all dilepton masses in .",
    "however the distinctive features of the angular information are likely to disappear or not be so important for smaller @xmath160 .",
    "for instance , the sm asymmetry will not be so large for smaller @xmath160 due to the absence of a near cancellation in some of the short distance factors in ( [ helamps ] ) .",
    "this suggests that concentrating on the region of large @xmath160 is not just convenient because of the lack of information from @xmath49 , but also because the angular information is most discriminating there .",
    "the pseudoscalar mode is not as rich in information as is , but it can be a powerful complement to it .",
    "for instance , the two - higgs doublet model considered here gives slightly larger rates in both modes , whereas the topcolor model that gives the largest rate in produces a rate in that is _ smaller _ than in the sm , as can be seen in table  ii .    in the near future experiments in both hadron and @xmath5 colliders will have sensitivity to branching fractions as the ones in tables  ii and ii .",
    "the current upper limit corresponds to a partial branching fraction in the region we have considered , of approximately @xmath161 @xcite for the mode .",
    "therefore , experimental information is about to start constraining new physics models and soon will be at the level of the sm predictions .",
    "the reconstruction of the dilepton asymmetries will then be an important probe into the physics of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    ".integrated asymmetry and branching fraction in the region @xmath162 in .",
    "for topcolor we take into account both possible relative signs @xmath163 between the fcnc couplings and the corresponding ckm matrix elements . [",
