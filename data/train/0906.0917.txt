    "the control of directly transmitted , viral childhood infections , around the globe has been strongly dependent on vaccination , the most effective control tool developed so far @xcite .",

    "these are therefore candidates for eradication .",
    "some examples include polio , measles and rubella , just to mention a few .",
    "vaccination strategies , however , have been each time more dependent on inferences based on quantitative models , which can , through simulation tools , yield distinct scenarios and possibilities .",
    "these simulation techniques , in turn , have been proved to be invaluable tools for helping health authorities to decide between competitive strategies of eradication or control of those infections .    in previous publications @xcite , we applied mathematical models to design and to evaluate the impact of vaccination against rubella in the state of so paulo , brazil .",
    "rubella is a viral infection that causes a mild disease , but it is considered to be a public health problem due to the risk of fetal infection and subsequent congenital defects @xcite .",
    "therefore , the goal of rubella vaccination is to prevent from the congenital rubella syndrome ( crs ) .",
    "plotkin @xcite argues that , due to the high prevalence of rubella in some countries , only high vaccine coverage would avoid the increase of crs .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse the effects of different contact patterns on vaccination strategies against rubella in some communities .",
    "we investigate a plausible form for the contact rate function including some constrains it must satisfy .",
    "we concentrate on the integral equation for the age - dependent force of infection  defined as the age - dependent number of new infections per capita , per unit time  , which relates the pattern of contacts among the members of a population with the prevalence of the disease , following a methodology developed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to examine the force of infection in steady state that results from a given vaccination strategy .",
    "we also turn our attention to the dynamics of the process , following the time development of the age - dependent force of infection when a vaccination strategy is started at a certain time @xmath0 in a previously nonimmunized population .",
    "some aspects of the age and time dependences in epidemic models have already been studied by some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig9 ] , corresponding to 70% coverage , at the ages of 8 , 16 , 25 and 35 yr .",
    "it can be seen that the above mentioned effect is clearly observed .",
    "the drop in the force of infection at the age of 8 yr is much larger than at 16 and 25 yr , and the effect at the age of 35 yr is almost negligible .",
    "however , about 15 years after the introduction of the vaccine , three major outbreaks are observed in the simulations , and this may be dangerous . the pattern of several oscillations in the incidence of an infectious disease , after the introduction of vaccination , has already been observed in real data @xcite .",
    "if the vaccinal coverage is increased to 80% , after small outbreaks , the disease disappears , as shown in fig .",

    "in this paper , we analyzed the temporal evolution of the age - dependent force of infection and incidence of rubella , after the introduction of a very specific vaccination program in a previously nonvaccinated population where rubella was in an endemic steady state .",
    "this very specific vaccination program consists in vaccinating children within a certain age range with a rate determined essentially by the public response to government advertisements .",
    "we conclude that a simple vaccination program is not very efficient ( very slow ) in the goal of eradicating the disease .",
    "this gives support to a mixed strategy proposed by massad _",
    "@xcite , accepted and implemented by the government of the state of so paulo .",
    "this strategy recommended a mass vaccination campaign against rubella in the state of so paulo for all children with ages between 1 and 10 yr as an initial intervention followed by a vaccination program of the form given by ( [ 50 ] ) , in the routine calendar at 15 months of age .",
    "as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , the results were very good , and there was a considerable reduction in the number of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome cases .",
    "the incidence of rubella and crs remained at low levels with the routine vaccination program , in agreement with our simulation results for high vaccination coverages .",
    "this formalism provides an integral equation for the force of infection in a steady state given the pattern of contacts between the members of the population and the specific form of the vaccination routines .",
    "to apply the formalism , the pattern of contacts between the members of the population , the so - called contact function @xmath15 , has to be estimated .",
    "some symmetries obeyed by @xmath15 and a general form for it were studied in sec .",
    "[ sec2b ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the force of infection in the absence of the vaccination was calculated from seroprevalence data from four communities in brazil , mexico , finland and the united kingdom . with this force of infection , in the absence of vaccination , the contact function @xmath15 for each community was estimated .",
    "it was noted that @xmath15 differed considerably between the communities studied , which is in agreement with the differences in the force of infection in the absence of vaccination .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] , the effects of several vaccination routines were calculated for the four communities studied . as a general conclusion",
    ", one can say that vaccination between 1 and 2 yr presents distinct advantages over any other strategy considered . in caieiras ,",
    "vaccination between 7 and 8 yr has the apparent advantage of shifting the average age of the first infection leftwards .",
    "however , if the coverage is above 60% , the impact of vaccinating between 1 and 2 yr on the force of infection is twice as high as vaccinating between 7 and 8 yr .",
    "this result confirms our previous analysis and recommendations of 1992 ( massad _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in all other communities",
    "studied , vaccination between 7 and 8 yr results in very disappointing impact when compared with vaccination between 1 and 2 yr .",
