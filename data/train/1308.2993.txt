    "saturation physics concerns the high energy qcd formalism which can describe the dense partons , in particlular , the gluons inside hadrons  @xcite .",
    "this formalism employs the small-@xmath2 evolution equations , namely , the bfkl equation  @xcite as well as its non - linear extension  @xcite , the bk - jimwlk equation  @xcite to resum the small-@xmath2 large logarithms @xmath3 .    as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the di - jet productions in @xmath1 collisions plays a crucial role in terms of distinguishing two fundamental unintegrated gluon distributions , namely , the weizsacker - williams ( ww ) gluon distribution and dipole gluon distribution , and searching for the saturation phenomenon in high energy experiments . to be more precise ,",
    "the dijet configuration with transverse momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 that we are especially interested in is the almost back - to - back dijet configuration , in which we can define two interesting variables , i.e. , the dijet transverse momentum imbalance @xmath6 and the dijet relative transverse momentum @xmath7 with @xmath8 . in particular",
    ", it has been argued that the dijet processes in @xmath1 collisions could be the smoking gun for the discovery of saturation phenomena  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the dijet production as probe to the gluon saturation is that the differential cross section can be directly related to the un - integrated gluon distributions of the nucleus in the small-@xmath2 factorization .",
    "for example , we can write down a generic expression for the dijet production cross section depending on @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the hard factor only depending on the hard momentum scale @xmath12 and the rapidities of the two jets , @xmath13 represents the wilson lines associated with the un - integrated gluon distributions of nucleus .",
    "the dependence on incoming parton distribution of nucleon and other kinematic variables are omitted in the above expression for simplicity . when the impact parameter dependence is neglected for large nucleus targets",
    ", @xmath13 only depends on the difference of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see the detailed expressions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) in the large @xmath16 limit . in the sense , in the correlation limit of dijet production",
    "mentioned above , @xmath12 dependence is decouple from @xmath9 dependence , and the differential cross section can be directly calculated from the un - integrated gluon distribution of the nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , only the leading order calculation is presented in refs .",
    "@xcite for various dijet processes , which may not be sufficient for drawing definite conclusions . in other words , in order to probe saturation phenomena by comparing with experimental data from @xmath1 collisions , the one - loop correction to the leading order results for various dijet processes seems to be indispensable .",
    "the major objective of this manuscript is to study the one - loop correction to dijet processes and other similar processes , identify the characteristic feature of all possible divergences and demonstrate that the most important correction is the sudakov type double logarithmic terms .",
    "the appearance of sudakov double logarithms , i.e. , @xmath17 , requires another type of resummation , namely , the sudakov resummation  @xcite , since @xmath18 can be of order @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , it is important to know whether or not we can consistently compute and perform the sudakov resummation in the saturation formalism , in the presence of small-@xmath2 resummation . through an explicit calculation of the production of higgs particle with mass @xmath21 and transverse momentum @xmath9 in @xmath1 collisions ,",
    "we show that one can consistently resum sudakov type double logarithms and small-@xmath2 single logarithms simultaneously .",
    "the higgs boson production process in @xmath1 collisions is one of the simplest process which allows us to compute sudakov factors , including the double logarithmic term @xmath22 and single logarithmic term @xmath23 exactly , since this process can be effectively viewed as a @xmath24 process ( @xmath25 ) without final state interactions at leading order .",
    "thus , the one - loop correction to the higgs boson inclusive production is relatively simpler to compute as compared to the dijet processes .",
    "the result for higgs boson production in @xmath1 collisions has been summarised and published earlier in ref  @xcite , in which we also comment on the phenomenological application of the sudakov resummation in the saturation formalism to the dijet processes .",
    "this manuscript not only contains many more details on the the calculation of the higgs boson production , but also provides the calculation for all the possible dijet productions in @xmath1 collisions and in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that there is another interesting and simple example , i.e. , the heavy quark pair production in dis , which only has final state interactions .",
    "this process can be viewed as the reverse process of the higgs boson productions in terms of the color flow .",
    "one can also easily show that this process contains a similar sudakov double logarithmic term at the one - loop order but with an additional @xmath26 factor .",
    "in addition , the sudakov logarithms typically have a factor @xmath27 depending on the color flow , which has been absorbed into the definition of @xmath28 in the above expression .",
    "the color factor @xmath27 is process dependent , which implies that it has to be determined case by case for various dijet production processes .",
    "last but not least , the complete evaluation of the one - loop corrections is too complicated to do , even for the higgs boson production .",
    "however , the leading power contributions are much easier to obtain .",
    "especially , the sudakov double logarithms , which is the most important leading power contribution at one - loop order , can be computed .",
    "therefore , in the following section , we first develop some useful technical tools through the detailed calculation of the one - loop correction to higgs boson production in @xmath1 collisions and heavy quark pair production in dis .",
    "after that , we evaluate the one - loop order graphs for various dijet production processes in @xmath1 collisions and in dis , and determine the corresponding coefficients @xmath27 for the sudakov double logarithmic terms .",
    "the computation of the single sudakov logarithms and other subleading contributions are less straightforward and more subtle , similar to that for the threshold resummation for hard processes such as heavy quark pair production and dijet production , where a matrix form has to be used  @xcite .",
    "we leave this for future studies .",
    "the bottom line is that the sudakov double logarithmic terms and small-@xmath2 type logarithms can be resumed simultaneously and independently in the saturation formalism .",
    "this conclusion holds for many processes , such as higgs boson production , heavy quark pair productions and back - to - back dijet production in @xmath1 collisions as well as in dis .",
    "therefore , after the sudakov double logarithms resummation , the differential cross section of eq .",
    "( [ generic ] ) can be modified as @xmath29 where the sudakov factor can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined in the following calculations and @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 coefficient is identified in the sudakov double logarithmic factor .",
    "the main object of this paper to evaluate @xmath33 for all the partonic processes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions by a detailed analysis of gluon radiation at one - loop order .    the physics behind the above arguments and the following analysis in this paper can be understood as follows .",
    "the gluon radiation comes from three different regions , for a particular partonic channel in @xmath1 collisions : ( 1 ) collinear gluon parallel to the incoming nucleon ; ( 2 ) collinear gluon parallel to the incoming nucleus ; ( 3 ) soft gluon radiation .",
    "for example , for one - gluon radiation contribution to the born diagram of the above hard processes in @xmath1 collisions , we can parameterize the radiated gluon momentum as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the four momenta of incoming partons in the partonic process . since the phase space of the radiated gluon will be integrated out to obtain the final differential cross section , we need to consider the three different momentum regions discussed above .",
    "the momentum region of ( 1 ) corresponds to @xmath37 , whereas @xmath38 , which contributes to the collinear divergence associated with the parton distribution from the nucleon . for region ( 2 ) , the dominant collinear gluon radiation parallel to the nucleus requires not only @xmath39 of order @xmath19 , but also close to @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath40 . effectively , because of @xmath41",
    ", this leads to @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to the rapidity divergence at one - loop order , which can be absorbed into the renormalization of the un - integrated gluon distribution of the nucleus in the small-@xmath2 limit .",
    "region ( 3 ) concerns the sudakov double logarithms where @xmath43 .",
    "the gluon radiation in this kinematic region depends on the overall color flow in the hard partonic processes .",
    "that is why the sudakov double logarithms have simple counting rule as briefly mentioned above and will be extensively analyzed in the following sections .",
    "the kinematics of the three regions are well separated , and at the leading power of @xmath44 , they can be factorized into various factors .",
    "the resummation for the collinear gluon parallel to the nucleon can be performed by dglap evolution of the integrated parton distributions ; for the collinear gluons parallel to the nucleus the resummation can be performed by bk - jimwlk evolution ; for the soft gluon radiation the resummation be done with the sudakov method ( the so - called collins - soper - sterman evolution  @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a detailed derivation for higgs boson production in @xmath1 collisions in the small-@xmath2 factorization formalism , where we show that the sudakov resummation can be performed consistently with the small-@xmath2 resummation",
    ". in particular , the three different regions of gluon radiation mentioned above will be analyzed , and the factorization is demonstrated at one - loop order . in this section , we will also present the basic techniques for our computation , which we will apply later for more complicated hard processes . in sec .",
    "iii , we extend our discussions to heavy quark pair production in deep inelastic scattering of @xmath0 collisions , where again it is the ww gluon distribution from the nucleus that contributes at the leading power of heavy quark mass .",
    "iv is devoted to the discussion of dijet production in dis processes . in sec .",
    "v , we summarize the generic structure of soft gluon radiation for two - particle productions , and the leading double logarithms are identified for various partonic processes .",
    "the analysis is focused in the collinear factorization framework with dilute - dilute scattering processes . in sec .",
    "vi , we derive the double logarithms for the quark jet - photon production in @xmath1 collisions , where the dipole gluon distribution from the nucleus contributes . in this section",
    ", we will also identify the small-@xmath2 evolution for the dipole gluon distribution from the nucleus . by comparing with that for the higgs boson production where the ww gluon distribution contributes",
    ", we understand the small-@xmath2 resummation is consistently resummed in our framework .",
    "the one - loop calculations clearly demonstrate that for different gluon distributions ( dipole vs ww ) , different evolution equations will apply . of course , in the dilute limit , they will be identical , i.e. , both reduce to the bfkl . in sec .",
    "vii , the analysis of the double logarithms is extended to various dijet production processes in @xmath1 collisions .",

    "@xcite , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can adopt the so - called dilute - dense factorization ( also known as the hybrid factorization ) to simplify the calculation in this manuscript , since the proton projectile is considered to be dilute as compared to the dense large nucleus target .",
    "therefore , we use collinear gluon distribution for the incoming gluons ( the horizontal gluon as shown in fig .",
    "[ higgslo ] ) from the proton projectile . due to the high gluon density in the large nucleus target , multiple gluon interactions ( represented by the vertical gluon as shown in the fig .",
    "[ higgslo ] ) have to be taken in account .",
    "thus , we need to use the unintegrated gluon distribution for the incoming gluon from the target nucleus . because higgs particles do not carry any color , the final state interaction is absent .",
    "it is then easy to see that the relevant un - integrated gluon distribution should be the so - called ww gluon distribution  @xcite .    calculated from fig .",
    "[ higgslo ] , the leading order cross section for producing higgs ( or heavy scalar particles ) with forward rapidity @xmath45 and transverse momentum @xmath9 in @xmath1 collisions@xcite , can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",

    ", one can also find that @xmath55 which gives the longitudinal momentum fraction of the incoming gluon distribution with respect to that of the target nucleus per nucleon .",
    "the minus sign in @xmath48 ensures that the above correlation function is positive since the derivatives bring down two factors of @xmath56 from the exponent of the wilson lines .",

    "( [ sww ] ) indicates the random colour charge average over the large nucleus wave function and implies the small-@xmath2 evolution of the relevant correlators inside . here",
    "@xmath58 is the dimensional regularization parameter .",
    "the factor of @xmath59 comes from the average of the polarization for the incoming gluon according to the convention in the dimensional regularization .",
    "this factor is universal for all diagrams at higher order , therefore we always factorize this factor into the leading order cross section when we perform the one - loop calculation in terms of the dimensional regularization .",
    "before we start the detailed evaluation for the one - loop amplitudes for the higgs boson production , let us briefly discuss the usual divergences that we are anticipating at the one - loop order from the point of view of the leading order cross section .",
    "first of all , when the radiated gluon is collinear to the proton projectile , or more precisely , the initial state gluon which comes from the proton , we find the collinear divergence which is corresponding to the renormalization of the incoming collinear gluon distribution @xmath52 .",
    "the renormalization of this collinear gluon distribution is governed by the well - known dglap evolution equation .",
    "furthermore , there should be the so - called rapidity divergence , which appears when the rapidity of the radiated gluon is reaching @xmath60 .",
    "the appearance of the rapidity divergence is simply due to the high energy limit which puts both the projectile and targets on the light cone .",
    "it comes from the region where the radiated gluon becomes collinear to the target nucleus .",

    "<S> in this manuscript , we present a complete study of the sudakov double logarithms resummation for various hard processes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions in the small-@xmath2 saturation formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we first employ a couple of slightly different formalisms to perform the one - loop analysis of the higgs boson production process in @xmath1 collisions , and demonstrate that sudakov - type logarithms arise as the leading correction and that they can be systematically resummed in addition to the usual small-@xmath2 resummation . </S>",
    "<S> we further study the sudakov double logarithms for other processes such as heavy quark pair production and back - to - back dijet production in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions through detailed calculation of the corresponding one - loop diagrams . as the most important contribution from the one - loop correction </S>",
    "<S> , the sudakov factor should play an important role in the phenomenological study of saturation physics in the @xmath1 programs at rhic and the lhc . </S>"
