    "underdoped high temperature superconductors are highly anisotropic , quasi two - dimensional materials , in which thermal and quantum fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter ( op ) should be important well below the pseudogap temperature .",
    "it has recently been shown that a phase fluctuating d - wave superconductor ( dsc ) at zero temperature ( @xmath7 ) is inherently unstable towards the formation of the very weak spin density wave ( sdw ) state with loss of phase coherence @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this follows from the observation that the standard fermi liquid theory for the bcs d - wave quasiparticles , besides the usual spatial symmetries , also acquires an additional continuous ( ` chiral ' @xcite ) symmetry at low energies .",
    "this symmetry becomes dynamically broken when the superconducting phase coherence is lost via proliferation of vortex defects .",
    "the theory of the phase incoherent ( pseudogap ) state in this formulation becomes closely related to the three dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , in which the coupling constant ( ` charge ' ) is proportional to the vortex condensate . in the crudest approximation , the fluctuations of the gauge - field",
    "may then be neglected in the superconducting state , which leaves quasiparticles as sharp low energy excitations .",
    "when the vortices condense and the charge in the @xmath0 is finite , the chiral symmetry of the dsc becomes dynamically broken , in analogy with the well known phenomenon in particle physics @xcite . in the present context",
    "this translates into weak sdw ordering , with confined spin-1/2 ( spinon ) excitations @xcite .",
    "several conceptual and practical issues of direct relevance to cuprates arise naturally in such an approach to underdoped high temperature superconductors .",
    "can the sc and the sdw long - range orders coexist ?",
    "such a coexistence appears rather generically in various mean - field treatments of microscopic models of cuprates @xcite , @xcite .",
    "several intriguing recent experiments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , also suggest the coexistence of the two inimical orderings . if there is a single dsc - sdw quantum phase transition , on the other hand , what should be its universality class ?",
    "what are the effects of the virtual vortex fluctuations _ inside _ the superconducting state ?",
    "these questions all require a better understanding of the quasiparticle - vortex interaction , particularly in the superconducting state .    a theory of low - energy d - wave quasiparticles coupled to phase fluctuations of the superconducting op which puts the earlier physical ideas of @xcite , @xcite into a consistent field - theoretical framework has recently been proposed in @xcite , @xcite",
    ". one result of that study is that , at least within a certain approximation @xcite , in the superconducting state spin of quasiparticles may be considered asymptotically decoupled from their charge at low energies .",
    "physically this is just what is expected , and may be understood as being a consequence of the long range phase coherence in a singlet superconductor @xcite , @xcite : the condensate screens perfectly the charge of quasiparticles , effectively transforming them into neutral , spin-1/2 excitations .    in this paper",
    "we wish to take advantage of this state of affairs and consider a simpler effective @xmath7 theory ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) for the spin sector of the fluctuating dsc only .",
    "we assume that in underdoped high temperature superconductors the amplitude of the superconducting op may be considered frozen well below the pseudogap temperature @xmath8 , but that the quantum fluctuations of its phase will inevitably arise sufficiently near half filling when the interaction between electrons becomes strong . in the phase",
    "incoherent ( pseudogap ) state our effective theory reduces to the previously studied @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite , with its concomitant sdw instability .",
    "deep in the dsc , on the other hand , the theory becomes equivalent to the three dimensional thirring model , with an ( irrelevant ) short range interaction between the electrically neutral spin-1/2 excitations , which we will , as traditionally , call spinons . the effective theory in eq .",
    "( 1 ) connects , and describes the region in between , these two limits , and establishes a physical link between the phase fluctuations and the magnetic excitations in underdoped cuprates .",
    "having the low energy theory for the spin degrees of freedom we proceed to derive several interesting consequences from it .",
    "first , we show that the condensation of vortices ( i. e. the loss of superconductivity ) and the breaking of the chiral symmetry for fermions ( the sdw instability ) in the theory coincide .",
    "the region of coexistence between the sc and the sdw long - range orders is not found .",
    "second , we find that the quantum dsc - sdw phase transition could be fluctuation - induced first - order , in agreement with our earlier study of the full theory that included charge @xcite . finally , and maybe most importantly , we calculate the spin dynamics _ induced _ by vortex fluctuations inside the superconducting state , in the leading approximation .",
    "the detailed evolution of the spin response with energy observed in the neutron scattering experiments on @xmath9 ( ybco ) @xcite,@xcite , @xcite is explained in terms of four diagonally incommensurate ` mother ' peaks , that should become discernible at lowest frequencies .",
    "these weak and narrow peaks are centered on the wave vectors that span between the diagonally opposite nodes of the superconducting op , and represent the collective particle - hole mode of the phase fluctuating dsc .",
    "the sdw instability obtained previously with the @xmath0 theory can be understood qualitatively as the condensation of this collective mode .",
    "the famous ` resonance ' at the commensurate wave vector @xmath10 is here obtained as an overlap between the all four mother peaks , which dominates in the spin response within certain window of energies .",
    "this energy window shrinks with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 , which may explain why the resonance has not been observed in @xmath11 ( lsco ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we introduce the effective theory of spin of quasiparticles , and discuss its physical motivation and the formal justification . in sec .",
    "iii we show how our theory avoids the coexistence of the sc and the sdw orders . in sec .",
    "iv we briefly discuss the nature of the dsc - sdw quantum phase transition .",
    "spin response is discussed in sec . v. the discussion of our results and the relation to other approaches",
    "is presented in the concluding section .",
    "consider the quantum mechanical ( @xmath7 ) action for the low energy quasiparticles in the two - dimensional phase fluctuating dsc , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the imaginary time , and @xmath15 describes the vortex loops , and @xmath16 implies that all such loops are of finite size , and thus the superconducting phase coherence .",
    "@xmath17 should be understood as being _ dual _ to the standard superconducting op , and @xmath18 means that vortex loops proliferated and that superconductivity is lost @xcite .",
    "two ( @xmath19 ) four - component dirac fermions describe the gapless , neutral , spin-1/2 ( spinon ) excitations near the four nodes of the superconducting order parameter at @xmath20 , one dirac field for each pair of diagonally opposed nodes , as defined previously in @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is the gauge - field that results from absorbing the singular part of the superconducting phase due to vortices into the spinon fields @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 are the dirac gamma matrices @xcite , and @xmath24 .",
    "finally , @xmath25 is an auxiliary ( chern - simons ) field which facilitates the statistical spinon - vortex coupling , as will be explained shortly .",
    "tuning parameter @xmath26 controls the magnitude of vortex fluctuations , and we assume it to be related to doping , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the critical doping in the underdoped regime .",
    "the coupling @xmath29 describes the short - range repulsion between the vortex loops .",
    "we work in units in which @xmath30 , and we have set the two characteristic velocities of the nodal quasiparticles @xmath31 in ( 1 ) , for simplicity .",
    "the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter is assumed frozen , and eq .",
    "( 1 ) is supposed to describe only the spin and the vortex degrees of freedom well below the pseudogap temperature @xmath8 , as in the previous work @xcite .",
    "one may physically understand the form of the theory ( 1 ) as follows @xcite : the exact integration over the gauge - field @xmath21 , which appears only linearly in ( 1 ) , leaves the spinon - vortex coupling @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the spin and vortex current densities , respectively .",
    "vortices and spinons therefore see each other as sources of a fictitious magnetic flux , and circling around a vortex with a spinon ( or vice versa ) leads to a phase change of @xmath36 .",
    "this is precisely the _ statistical _ ( aharonov - bohm ) part of the interaction between vortices and quasiparticles @xcite , @xcite , which couples only to spin .",
    "the regular part of the phase , which provides the standard doppler shift of quasiparticle energies and couples only to charge , can be ` gauged away ' @xcite at the price of introducing an additional , ultimately _ irrelevant _ interaction term .",
    "absorbing this regular part of the phase into quasiparticles converts them into spinons @xcite , represented by @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the final point is that at low energies and in the superconducting state the spin of quasiparticles may be considered decoupled from its charge @xcite .",
    "essentially , this is because one can consider the superconducting condensate to carry all the charge in the phase coherent state .",
    "similar conclusion may also be reached within the gauge theory formulation of the t - j model @xcite .",
    "the separation between spin and charge allows one to study spin excitations separately from the charge in the fluctuating dsc at low energies .",
    "( 1 ) may therefore be understood as an _ effective _ theory for the spin of quasiparticles .",
    "one can also derive it from the full theory which includes charge @xcite , @xcite by simply omitting the additional chern - simons field for the charge degrees of freedom .    finally , in writing ( 1 ) the anisotropy between the fermi and the op related velocities , @xmath38 , and all the local interactions between quasiparticles @xcite have been neglected , as irrelevant at low energies @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will , however , find it necesary to restore the velocity anisotropy later when we discuss the spin response , where this feature will turn out to play an important role .",
    "although in this work we are concerned with the vortex fluctuations in the superconducting state , which is a complementary problem to the one studied in the previous papers on the @xmath0 theory of the pseudogap phase @xcite , @xcite , let us nevertheless mention how the theory ( 1 ) is related to the @xmath0 in the mean - field approximation for the vortex field . entirely neglecting the fluctuations in @xmath17 , in the superconducting phase ( @xmath39 )",
    ", the integration over @xmath25 would constrain @xmath40 , and spinons become free . when vortices condense ( @xmath41 )",
    ", on the other hand , the gauge - field @xmath25 acquires a mass via higgs mechanism , @xmath42 .",
    "the gaussian integration over @xmath25 produces then the maxwell term for @xmath21 , @xmath43 .",
    "together with the dirac lagrangian this constitutes the @xmath0 for spinons , in which the fermions chiral symmetry generated by @xmath44 and @xmath45 is dynamically broken by the generation of the small mass term @xmath46 @xcite . in the present context",
    "such a mass @xmath47 is proportional to the weak sdw op , with the ( incommensurate ) ordering wave vectors @xmath48 that connect the diagonally opposed nodes of the superconducting op @xcite .",
    "our aim will therefore be to understand how the theory ( 1 ) interpolates between the limits of @xmath0 in the pseudogap , and the non - interacting theory of spinons in the superconducting phases .",
    "in particular , we want to understand the evolution of spin dynamics with progressive quantum disordering of the dsc , which is assumed to correspond to underdoping .",
    "we begin with the issue of possible coexistence of the sdw and the dsc orderings .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , the vortex condensation and the sdw transition in the theory ( 1 ) coincide .",
    "it is not obvious that this feature survives the inclusion of the fluctuations , and it is conceivable that the sdw transition may occur within the superconducting phase @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to examine this issue",
    "we first ask what would be the _ exact _ propagator for the gauge field @xmath21 if there were no fermions , i. e. when @xmath49 in ( 1 ) . we then approximate the interacting action for @xmath21 that would result from the integrations over @xmath17 and @xmath25 with the effective gaussian term that reproduces that exact propagator . in the landau gauge",
    "such a propagator is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the transverse current - current correlation function in the @xmath52 theory .",

    "linear dependence of @xmath67 on momentum is an exact result @xcite . inserting this into the dyson equation we find that at @xmath63 the effect of vortices is only to increase the coefficient @xmath68 .",
    "recalling that the non - trivial solution of the dyson equation ( 4 ) exists only for @xmath69 @xcite , for @xmath19 we find that chiral symmetry at @xmath63 would be already broken only for @xmath70 , where we have also included the known @xmath71 correction to @xmath67 in the large-@xmath58 approximation @xcite .",
    "since @xmath59 in the physical case we conclude that right at the superconducting critical point sdw order is most likely absent .",
    "little further thought shows that , if correct , the above result implies that the sdw order is absent for all @xmath55 .",

    "assume that for @xmath55 a non - trivial solution of the eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath73 , does exist .",
    "such a solution would then satisfy @xmath74 on the other hand , we already established that there is only a trivial solution of the dyson equation at @xmath63 .",
    "this means that assuming a candidate function @xmath75 and inserting it under the integral in the dyson equation ( 4 ) for @xmath63 will produce only a _ smaller _",
    "new @xmath76 , since under iterations the physically acceptable self - energy must approach the trivial solution .",
    "this further implies that any @xmath76 from the domain of attraction of the trivial solution at @xmath63 has to satisfy the inequality opposite to ( 5 ) .",
    "a non - trivial @xmath73 at @xmath55 therefore can not exist if it did not exist at @xmath77 .    for @xmath78 superconductivity",

    "the above argument strongly suggests that there is a single dsc - sdw transition in the theory ( 1 ) , but does not say anything about its nature .",
    "this issue in the full theory with both spin and charge was addressed in @xcite , and here we will provide a brief alternative calculation in our effective theory that supports the earlier results . to study the phase transition it is better to proceed in the opposite direction , and integrate over the fermions first .",

    ". 7 ) . as @xmath180 ,",
    "therefore , the commensurate peak energy @xmath181 .",
    "we thus predict that the spin gap , and the @xmath182 extrapolated energy of the resonance are essentially the same .",
    "remarkably , the spin gap that can be estimated from a different set of data on ybco ( fig .",
    "17 in @xcite ) is quite similar , @xmath183 , consistent with our interpretation . at large energies ,",
    "@xmath176 should behave as @xmath184 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , which also appears to be in a qualitative , but not quite a quantitative , accord with the data .",
    "finally , we predict a new feature of the spin response at the lowest frequencies : four weak and narrow ` diagonally ' incommensurate mother peaks , the energy of which vanishes with @xmath5 .",
    "their low intensity and sharpness make them rather elusive , and indeed they have yet to be observed .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the evolution of the spin response with frequency as observed in underdoped ybco can be straightforwardly understood in terms of these makes one optimistic about their existence .",
    "we find that the mother peaks should resolve as in fig . 2 at a frequency @xmath185 .",
    "our optimism is further supported by the fine details of the measured spin response , which appear so far to be in accord with our picture .",
    "for example , eq .",
    "( 14 ) predicts that the response function at the ` parallel ' peaks must always be less than twice larger than that at @xmath48 at the same frequency .",
    "closer inspection of the data in @xcite or @xcite , for example , conforms to this expectation .",
    "we have proposed an effective theory for the low - energy spin excitations in the strongly fluctuating d - wave superconductor .",
    "the theory extends the @xmath0 of the pseudogap phase into the superconducting phase .",
    "it suggests that there is a single dsc - sdw transition , which may be fluctuation induced first order .",
    "we derived approximately the spin response function of the fluctuating d - wave superconductor , and used it to qualitatively explain the neutron scattering experiments in underdoped ybco .    besides standing in clear opposition to most of the mean - field theories of the high temperature superconductivity @xcite , @xcite , our conclusion that there is no coexistence region between the dsc and the sdw is also in contrast to the result of pereg - barnea and franz @xcite , who studied a closely related theory to ( 1 ) . in their model spinons",
    "are coupled to the massive gauge field in the superconducting phase , so that after integration over the gauge field the model would become similar to the thirring model in our eq .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the chiral symmetry for fermions becomes broken at a _ finite _ mass of the gauge field @xmath140 , which implies coexistence of the sdw order and the phase coherence .",
    "one can readily understand this result by considering the dimensionless coupling constant in the thirring model @xmath186 . indeed ,",
    "if the cutoff @xmath112 is kept constant , @xmath187 at a finite @xmath140 , and the model exhibits its well - known chiral instability .",
    "this result , however , in the more complete theory ( 1 ) is avoided by remembering that in the thirring model , or in an equivalent description of @xcite , the cuttof needs to be @xmath188 as well , because for momenta @xmath189 the inverse gauge field propagator becomes a linear function of @xmath190 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . with this modification , as @xmath191 , @xmath192 , with the @xmath193 apparently too small for the chiral instability to occur _ before _ the critical point is reached .",
    "the result that superconducting and antiferromagnetic orders are not comfortably coexisting in underdoped cuprates is also in agreement with recent experiments on heat transport and c - axis penetration depth in clean underdoped ybco @xcite , @xcite .",
    "both measurements find that d - wave nodes survive in the underdoped regime , without the quasiparticles becoming gaped .",
    "if there would be a sufficiently strong coexisting antiferromagnetic ( @xmath10 ) or sdw ( @xmath194 ) order , on the other hand , quasiparticles would acquire precisely such a gap at the nodes .",
    "it should be said , however , that the coexistence of sdw and sc orders is not in principle impossible , and can be induced by a strong favourable interaction term , for example , omitted in ( 1 ) .",
    "our point is only that vortex condensation as the dynamical mechanism behind the appearance of the sdw order in the theory ( 1 ) does not lead to such coexistence .",
    "our picture of spin response in underdoped cuprates is similar in spirit to that of rantner and wen @xcite .",
    "there are important conceptual and formal differences , however .",
    "rantner and wen considered the pseudogap regime , _ above _ the superconducting @xmath5 , and proposed that spinons may there effectively be described as coupled to a massless gauge field .",
    "neglecting the chiral instability such a theory is almost universally believed to have , they proposed the algebraic spin liquid as the pseudogap phase , in which in the large - n approximation the spin response is in fact _ suppressed _ at low frequencies . only if the number of fermion components n is taken sufficiently small ( smaller in fact than the @xmath195 below which the chiral instability occurs in the same calculation ) does one recover the enhancement of the spin response . to account phenomenologically for the phase coherence in the superconducting state rantner and",
    "wen added a mass to their gauge field , which then further suppresses the spin response at energies below the mass .",
    "we see that a qualitatively similar mechanism operates in our theory , but at @xmath7 : the gauge field coupled to spinons is massless outside the sc , and massive inside",
    ". the form of our spin response function @xmath176 , however , is quite different , which , for example , leads to reappearance of the incommensurate peaks at high energies ( fig .",
    "5 ) , among other things .",
    "most importantly , the mass of the gauge field @xmath140 in the superconducting phase that was postulated in @xcite on phenomenological grounds here becomes a _ result _ within the effective theory ( 1 ) .    with the parameters we used the energy of the resonance @xmath196 ,",
    "not far from the generic @xmath197 see in ybco , and more recently in @xmath198 ( bscco ) @xcite , @xcite . given the crudeness of our approximation this is an encouraging agreement .",
    "however , there is a considerable uncertainty in the parameters we used which may easily make this agreement fortuitous .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath199 @xcite would push the resonance energy in our calculation to @xmath200 .",
    "also , we do not find the @xmath201-function response at the commensurate wave vector , but only a @xmath202 decay on the high energy side ( fig .",
    "this is contrast to the mean - field calculation within the @xmath203 model of brinckmann and lee @xcite , who found that the next - nearest - neighbor hopping may lead to a @xmath201-function term in @xmath134 .",
    "our result , however , seems to agree with the measurements of fong et al .",
    "@xcite on underdoped ybco , where the width of the resonance of @xmath204 was observed ( see fig . 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that brinckmann and lee , just like us , also tend to overestimate the energy of the resonance , and found it necessary to reduce the coupling @xmath205 by hand by a factor of three in their calculation to match the experiment .",
    "we find the commensurate response to dominate only within a certain window of energies around the resonant energy , while both at lower ( @xmath206 ) and higher ( @xmath207 ) energies the peaks are located at the parallel incommensurate wave vectors . in our calculation",
    "the resonance exists for @xmath208 , with the parameters we used . for a lower @xmath5 the window of the dominant response at @xmath10 shrinks .",
    "this may provide an explanation why the resonance was never found in lsco , but has been seen in both ybco and bscco which both have a higher @xmath5 , without other parameters being too different .",
    "alternatively , the physics of underdoped lsco may be qualitatively different , as some measurements would suggest @xcite .",
    "we end by repeating the central prediction of this work : the appearance of four weak and narrow ` diagonal ' incommensurate peaks , the energy of which should extrapolate to zero with vanishing superconducting @xmath5 .",
    "it is the interplay of these fundamental peaks that leads to evolution of spin response with frequency in our calculation in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "while some other theories @xcite , @xcite would also lead to such ` diagonal ' incommensuration at low frequencies , we also predict that the energy of these peaks should vanish with @xmath5 , since they represent the intrinsic soft mode of the phase fluctuating d - wave superconductor .",
    "detection of this feature in future neutron scattering experiments would provide strong support in favor of the theory of the underdoped cuprates advocated here .",
