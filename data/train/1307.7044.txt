    "<S> synchronization is a universal phenomenon that is important both in fundamental studies and in technical applications . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate synchronization in the simplest quantum - mechanical scenario possible , i.e. , a quantum - mechanical self - sustained oscillator coupled to an external harmonic drive . using the power spectrum </S>",
    "<S> we analyze synchronization in terms of frequency entrainment and frequency locking in close analogy to the classical case . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a step - like crossover to a synchronized state as a function of the driving strength . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the classical case , there is a finite threshold value in driving . </S>",
    "<S> quantum noise reduces the synchronized region and leads to a deviation from strict frequency locking .    </S>",
    "<S> synchronization is an intriguing phenomenon exhibited by a wide range of physical , chemical , and biological systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic setting consists of coupled self - oscillating systems synchronizing their motion ; examples include such different phenomena as orbital resonances in planetary motion or the rhythm of muscle cells in mammal hearts . </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic and widely studied model of synchronization is the kuramoto model of coupled limit - cycle oscillators  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the most fundamental scenario of classical synchronization is the frequency locking of a self - sustained oscillator which is externally driven by a harmonic force  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a self - sustained oscillator takes energy from a source , e.g.  by negative damping , and can therefore maintain stable oscillatory motion and an undetermined phase in the presence of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> if the oscillator is additionally driven by a harmonic force , there is a finite range of detuning for which the oscillator is frequency - locked to the drive , and noise can reduce or destroy this range of synchronization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also regimes of frequency entrainment in which the oscillator frequency is pulled towards the drive frequency , but does not reach it . in this case , the frequency of the driven oscillator , the observed frequency @xmath0 , differs from both the natural frequency of the oscillator and the drive frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model exhibiting these effects is the van der pol oscillator  @xcite which allows the analysis of the complex phenomenology of synchronization .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the question if synchronization exists in _ quantum _ systems has attracted a lot of interest . </S>",
    "<S> there have been important first attempts to address this problem theoretically , from communities as diverse as trapped atomic ensembles , josephson junctions , and nanomechanical systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optomechanical systems  @xcite appear to offer a particularly promising approach . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have reported classical synchronization of nanomechanical oscillators @xcite , the quantum many - body dynamics of an array of identical optomechanical cells has been predicted to show synchronized behavior  @xcite , and quantitative measures for quantum synchronization based on the heisenberg uncertainty principle have been applied to two and many coupled optomechanical cells  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the most basic example of quantum synchronization : a quantum version of the harmonically driven van der pol oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> to complement other recent work which studied phase locking  @xcite , we focus on frequency entrainment and frequency locking for various detunings , driving strengths , and non - linear damping rates . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the power spectrum as a theoretical and experimental tool to characterize the observed frequency . </S>",
    "<S> as one of our main results , we find a step - like crossover to a synchronized state as a function of the strength of the harmonic drive . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the classical case , there is a finite threshold value in driving . </S>",
    "<S> we find that quantum noise reduces the synchronized region as compared to the ( noiseless ) classical case and leads to a deviation from strict frequency locking . for weak ( strong ) driving and for small non - linear damping rates , frequency entrainment is reduced ( enhanced ) by increasing the non - linear damping rate . </S>",

    "<S> the information contained in the power spectrum thus neatly complements previous analyses of phase locking . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown the existence of weak and strong frequency entrainment in the quantum case and found a threshold in the strength of the drive below which there is only weak frequency entrainment between the oscillator and the drive . </S>",
    "<S> our study contributes new insights in understanding synchronization in the quantum regime and also allows various extensions as for instance the investigation of synchronization of two ( or an ensemble of ) nonidentical quantum van der pol oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question is whether engineered noise @xcite ( classical and/or quantum ) can favor synchronization .    _ </S>",
