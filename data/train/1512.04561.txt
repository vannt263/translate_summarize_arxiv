    "blazars are active galactic nuclei exhibiting large variability at all frequencies . their emission is dominated by a relativistic jet , the amplification factor of the intensity is characterized by a power of the doppler factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the jet produces a non thermal spectrum where often one can distinguish a synchrotron and a compton component .",
    "the energy source is assumed to be a combination of accretion on a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and extraction of its spin energy . in some cases",
    "the presence of an accretion disk is suggested by the appearance in the spectral energy distribution of a thermal component . the observed variability is supposedly a consequence of the intrinsic change of the accretion onto the smbh , of the jet formation process , and specifically of its beaming .",
    "various processes originating in different regions and with different time scales result in a complicated variability leading to rather chaotic light curves .",
    "the study of variability through auto- and cross - correlation procedures has proven to be effective in constraining complex models of these sources .",
    "the discovery of a periodicity in the variability could have profound consequences in the global understanding of the sources , constituting a basic block for models .",
    "the effort for finding periodicities has been substantial at all frequencies ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a rather robust claim is that of a @xmath112 year period in oj 287 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a bl lac object possibly containing in its center a system of two smbhs @xcite .",
    "note however that the periodicity and the picture are disputed for instance by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a 1980 day optical period for the quasar pg1302 - 102 , which also appears reliable .",
    "models based on the presence of a binary black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "convolution of various processes can lead to an apparently unstable or variable period , i.e. to quasi - periodicities .",
    "search for quasi - periodicities in blazars is a valid and efficient diagnostic tool .",
    "some sources could exhibit long lasting quasi - periodic behaviors .",
    "the time scales of the events and their persistence in the light curves may allows us to shed light on the physical processes underlying these variations . among previous proposals of year - like quasi - periodicities in blazars ,",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "in addition , recently @xcite collecting photometric data of pks 2155 - 304 published in the last 35 years , discovered a quasi - periodicity of @xmath2 317 d. this was confirmed by our independent photometry @xcite .",
    "moreover we showed that a periodicity appears also in the @xmath0-rays observed by the _ fermi _ mission at @xmath3 .    because _ fermi _ has monitored continuously the sky since @xmath1 6 years , it is obvious that it is only now that one can combine optical and @xmath0-ray searches for year - like periodicities , a procedure which was successful for pks 2155 - 304 . since the number of covered periods in the optical and in @xmath0-rays is limited , as in the case of pks 2155 - 304 , it is difficult to assess the stability on a long - term basis of the inferred ( quasi ) periodicities .",
    "the starting point of the present investigation are the vrijhk photometric observations obtained with the robotic rapid eye mounting telescope ( rem , * ? ? ?",

    "these data are available on - line .",
    "we add also the rem photometry of 3c 279 , which is unpublished thus far .",
    "we have then combined the rem data with those derived from the small & moderate aperture research telescope system archives ( smarts , * ? ? ?",
    "the rem data on pks 2155 - 304 were originally examined in @xcite and are those which led us to confirm the results of @xcite . in table [ sample ] we report a summary of the characteristics of the six sources , of which two are flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and the others are bl lac objects .",
    "the unpublished photometry of 3c 279 is described in section [ photometry ] .",
    "the search for periodicities from both optical data and _ fermi _ archives is presented in section [ search ] .",

    "the procedures for constructing gamma ray curves are complex but rather standardized , and fully described e.g. in @xcite .",
    "note that these curves are not corrected for background .    the search for ( quasi )",
    "periodicities in the light curves of active galactic nuclei is notoriously an arduous problem , as it was pointed out in the seminal paper by @xcite , who considered the x - ray light curve of 3c 273 and indicated a number of caveats , which should be taken into account , before assessing the reality of a periodicity . in our case",
    "four main points should be examined :    * our optical sampling is rather irregular , as usual in ground based observations . on the other hand @xmath0-ray light curves are essentially evenly spaced . *",
    "the light curves are affected by frequency dependent _ red _ noise . *",
    "the total duration @xmath5 of the monitoring is @xmath6 9 yr in the optical , @xmath6 6 yr in gamma rays , constraining the minimum frequency that can be searched for .",
    "* flares or periods of high activity can affect the analysis , requiring a careful check of the results .",
    "the problem of the presence of red noise in evaluating a periodogram has been discussed in detail in the case of x - ray light curves , mainly in the context of galactic sources . the case of time",
    "series not evenly spaced typically requires the use of interpolation techniques .",
    "their application implies that the interpolated data points are no longer independent and may introduce a significant additional bias , which leads to an enhancement of low - frequency components at the expense of higher frequency ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the assessment of the reality of periodicities can not be carried out without firm procedures to measure a significance against the background noise .",
    "in particular the problem of the red noise modeling was examined by , i.e. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , although usually for the simpler case of evenly sampled time - series .",
    "a procedure for the study of periodicities in non - equally spaced light curves and affected by red noise was developed by @xcite with reference to paleoclimatic time series . in this procedure",
    "a first - order autoregressive ( ar1 ) process is applied to model the red - noise @xcite .",
    "this avoids interpolation in the time domain with the introduced bias .",
    "the ar1 technique can give a good description of rather smooth and regular time - series , as it is the case of the fermi light - curves we are here considering .",
    "our optical light - curves are , on the contrary , much more difficult to model due to periods of high - activity and/or flares introducing order of magnitudes variations together with a highly irregular sampling .",
    "nevertheless , the results of these analyses can provide useful hints about the significance of a detected possible periodicity , in particular when these periods are also present in the fermi data .",
    "we started with light curves with binning of 1 day in the optical bands , and 1 week in the @xmath0-rays ( see figure [ 3lc_pks0537]-[3lc_pks2155 ] ) .",
    "we considered @xmath0-rays bins with test statistics @xcite @xmath7 4 , corresponding to a @xmath1 2@xmath8 detection .",
    "note that for the large majority of cases the detections are much more significant than this limit .",
    "we have chosen a maximum frequency for the period analysis corresponding to @xmath1 20 days .",
    "in fact here we are not interested in the short time scale variability . the procedure yields ( see figures [ pow_pks0537]-[pow_pks2155 ] ) :    * lomb and scargle periodograms @xcite , which account for the unevenly spaced photometry . *",

    ": we have chosen @xmath10 ( 2.5@xmath8 ) and @xmath11 ( 3@xmath8 ) .",
    "the significance is given by the comparison of the periodogram with that based on the auto - regressive model ( see above ) to test the null hypothesis that the observed time series can be fully accounted by the noise .",
    "in tables [ top_hits_pks0537]-[top_hits_pks2155 ] we report the _ observed _ periods corresponding to peaks with @xmath12 99% significance .",
    "we evaluated the period uncertainty following @xcite , searching for the mean noise power level ( mnpl ) in the vicinity of the investigated period t. the 1@xmath8 confidence interval on t is the width of the peak in the power spectrum at @xmath13mnpl , where @xmath14 is the height of the peak . the sinusoidal artificial light - curves with the most significant periods calculated using vstar package are reported in figures [ 3lc_pks0537]-[3lc_pks2155 ] .",
    "we checked for aliases derived from the interval sampling between observations or the sampling rate , which cause false peaks in the time analysis ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we adopted the procedure in the period analysis software and found in all the nir - optical curves evidences of an alias period of @xmath1 370 d , which is representative of the year length .",
    "the corresponding peak is negligible with respect to the other periodicities in all the sources with the exception of pks 2005 - 489 . applying the same procedure to @xmath0-ray light curves ,",
    "no aliases have been detected , as expected , except for a significant one at 7 d , denoting the sampling rate of the _ fermi _ data .",
    "the peaks , which appear marginally revealed in the spectral analysis for alias detection , are marked in tables [ top_hits_pks0537 ] - [ top_hits_pks2155 ] .",
    "we now examine the sources , separately , discussing the most important possible periodicities detected by the analysis . as a general point",
    ", several periods appear to have a formal significance close or better than 99% .",
    "however considering the many possible sources of uncertainty ( mainly in the optical / nir ) it may be not sufficient to provide a fully solid statement about their reliability .",

    "the presence of peaks at @xmath23 260 d , with significance @xmath24 in v and k , stands out . in r and v bands",

    "the significances are above @xmath33 . in k",
    "it is noticeable also the presence of peaks with @xmath34 at 453 d and 151 d , which with @xmath32 and @xmath35 could be harmonics of the same period @xmath3676 d.",
    "the advent of robotic telescopes in the last decade on the one hand , and the systematic monitoring of the @xmath0-ray sky since 2008 , gave an unprecedented opportunity for exploring quasi - periodicities in blazars at year - like timescales .",
    "the presence of possible associated periodicities in both the optical and @xmath0-ray bands may be indicative of their physical relevance . the most convincing cases are pks 2155 - 304 , oj 287 and 3c 279 .    in the following",
    "we discuss some possible interpretations for the physical mechanisms causing the periodic variability of these sources with a rest - frame year - like duration . as already discussed in @xcite and similarly to the interpretation proposed by @xcite for oj 287 , the observed year - like timescale periodicity",
    "could be related to the orbit of a perturbing object .",
    "this could destabilize the accretion flow onto the primary smbh , modulating the accretion rate and , as a consequence , the luminosity of the active nucleus . assuming the mass of the active smbh @xmath37 ( typical of blazars ) and that the perturber is significantly less massive ( @xmath38 ) , the observed periodicity implies a separation between the two bodies of @xmath39 r@xmath40 pc , where r@xmath41 is the schwarzschild radius of the central smbh .",
    "currently available observations do not allow us to constrain the nature of the perturber . even assuming that this is a secondary smbh of mass @xmath42 , the gravitational wave ( gw ) driven orbital decay would be of the order of 1 myr @xcite , making it hard to observe any frequency drift due to the shrinking of the perturber orbit .",
    "a second possibility is that the observed periodicity is related to the precession period of the blazar jet .",
    "we can draw two distinct scenarios , depending on whether the jet is forced to be aligned to the smbh spin or not .",
    "in this second case the jet would be aligned to the angular momentum of the inner part of the accretion disc . in the case",
    "the inner disc is not lying on the smbh equatorial plane , it would undergo lense - thirring precession around the smbh spin .",
    "the lense thirring precession period scales as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the smbh spin parameter .",
    "if the accretion flow is geometrically thick , the inner disk precesses as a solid body , as demonstrated by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case the observed period",
    "does provide an estimate of the size of the inner precessing region .",
    "about 900 day correspond to @xmath45 , while @xmath46 day would imply @xmath47 ( both the estimates assume @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "if instead the jet is aligned with the smbh spin , the observed periodicity has to be related to the precession timescale of the spin itself . in order for the observed flux to be significantly affected by the precession",
    ", the angle between the smbh spin and the axis of precession ( defined by the total angular momentum of the system ) has to be of the order of the jet opening angle @xmath50 or greater . because of the large mass of the smbh , the angular momentum of the accreting gas within the inner @xmath51 can not cause such a large displacement of the smbh spin . a secondary smbh orbiting at @xmath52 is required in this case .",
    "the secondary mass needed to cause a significant variation in the observed flux has to be @xmath53 .",
    "this last scenario has a number of testable predictions : + @xmath54 the lifetime of such a system would be determined by the gw driven orbital decay of the binary .",
    "the timescale is @xmath55 yr for @xmath56 and it scales with the inverse of @xmath57 . for @xmath58 a drift of the period toward smaller values could be observable in the next decades ; + @xmath59 a faster variability , corresponding to the orbital timescale of the binary , could be observed ( with a period of @xmath60 days assuming @xmath61 ) .    in a different scenario ,",
    "the detected quasi - periodic oscillations in blazars could be related to jet emissions .",
    "variability can be ascribed to helical jets or helical structures in jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which may be quite common in blazars @xcite .",
    "they could arise from hydrodynamical instabilities in magnetized jets @xcite or from variations in the jet engine , e.g. , accretion disc instabilities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) , also coupled with the interaction of the jet plasma with the surrounding medium .",
    "the emitting flow moving around a helical path could produce relatively long - term quasi - periodic changes in doppler boosted flux @xcite .",
    "in such a picture a rotating helical structure was proposed to explain , e.g. , both the quasi - periodic behavior ( @xmath18 yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of bl lacertae and the occurrence and the mean shape of major radio - optical outbursts in ao 0235 + 16 ( @xmath15.7 yr , * ? ? ?",
    "relativistic shocks ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exciting jet helical patterns can be also considered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as models based on dominant turbulent cells in plasma jet @xcite driving short - lived quasi - periodic oscillations behind a shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of quasi - periodic peaks in radio - mapped jet emissions are , for instance , discussed in @xcite for the case of pks 0637 - 752 , where large - scale shocks in continuous flow are invoked ( re - confinement shocks , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ) .",
    "the discussion by @xcite proposes time scales of variability much larger than those inferred in this paper , but the issue should be reconsidered in detail .",
    "the significance of the detected periods is almost never very high , although in several case good enough to deserve consideration .",
    "as discussed in the text , a periodicity analysis of highly irregular and unevenly sampled time - series is never an easy task . on the other hand , in some cases the detected periods",
    "are also connected with periods derived from _ fermi _ data , where most of the source of uncertainty do not apply .",
    "it is then possible that quasi - periodicities of @xmath1 1 yr in blazars are not rare .",
    "their origin is not easy to be traced , and detailed models are not yet available .",
    "progress in the field can come from the study of other blazars , which have both a long optical monitoring , and are relatively bright in the _ fermi _ archives .",
    "it is also obvious to search for confirmation of the periodicities in the x - rays where large amount of sparse observations are archived .",
    "however , the x - rays could be produced independently of the optical and @xmath0-rays .",
    "for the future , observations of the smarts and rem type should hopefully be prosecuted for several years , largely improving the robustness of the analysis for periodicities of several months / one year length .",
