    "the dna molecule is one of the most complex systems encountered in nature . by its intricate , aperiodic structure it constitutes an information source for the synthesis of the different entities and for the occurrence of the multitude of delicately balanced processes within living cells .",
    "yet the connection between global dna structure and its various functions remains to a large extent elusive , particularly in view of the coexistence of coding and non - coding regions and the realization of the important role of non - coding sequences in higher organisms @xcite .",
    "one view of the dna molecule frequently adopted in the literature is that of two nested non - overlapping symbolic sequences - the coding and non - coding regions - each of which is expressed in terms of four symbols / letters corresponding to the four bases a , c , g and t or in the contracted form of two symbols / letters , purines ( a , g ) and pyrimidines ( t , c ) .",
    "the observed complexity of these nested sequences has been shaped during evolutionary time based on functional needs .",
    "processes like single nucleotide mutations , insertion and deletion of segments , multiple repetitions of elements acting simultaneously over different length and time scales have shaped the complexity of current day genomes producing intriguing statistical properties @xcite . in this",
    "latter setting early investigations have shown that the succession of bases along coding regions in higher organisms presents short range correlations , whereas non - coding regions exhibit long - range correlations @xcite .",
    "for these organisms the coding segment length distribution has an exponentially falling tail whereas the non - coding segment one falls off as a power law @xcite .    in the present work the structure of dna , viewed as a symbolic sequence ,",
    "is analyzed from the standpoint of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , dynamical systems theory and information theory .",
    "a first question raised concerns spatial asymmetry along the sequence , its signatures and its role in information processing .",
    "a second question pertains to the identification and analysis of global indicators of the underlying complexity , beyond the linear correlations usually considered in the literature .",
    "to arrive at a quantitative formulation of these questions we view a dna chain as the realization of a stationary stochastic process , i.e. , a process where the probabilities @xmath1 of the different states / symbols attain rapidly limiting values as the sample size is increased , in which the role of the time step in the traditional setting is played by the `` spatial '' shift by one unit in sequence space .    the data along with the results of a preliminary statistical analysis are compiled in sec .",

    "for the needs of our analysis we have employed the genomic data from two large human chromosomes ( 10 and 14 ) and two of the smaller ones ( 20 and 22 ) . in the sequel we frequently use as working data set a long contig in chromosome 20 of the homo sapiens genome .",
    "this genomic contig is the locus n1011387 ( primary assembly ) and contains 26259569 base pairs ( bps ) , while the entire chromosome 20 contains @xmath2 bps .",
    "this contig is a dna entity long enough to ensure good statistics , when addressing both the short and long range spatial properties .",
    "moreover it is representative of the entire dna molecule , since it contains both coding and non - coding sequences and other functional elements in similar densities as for all other human chromosomes .",
    "in particular , the nucleotide frequencies for the contig are : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "occasionally , unknown bps denoted by @xmath5 which still resist in todays sequencing techniques , are found in genomes .",
    "the @xmath5-percentage is very small and does not contribute significantly to the statistics .",
    "we can then choose either to eliminate all @xmath5 s or to replace them randomly with one of the other four @xmath6 .",
    "for both choices the presented results are indistinguishable , up to insignificant statistical errors .",
    "very similar nucleotide frequencies are found in the other human chromosomes .",
    "the frequency of the four base pairs is not constant throughout the genome but varies along the sequences depending on evolutionary factors and on the presence ( or absence ) of functional units .",
    "for example the presence of the complex @xmath7 is associated with the presence of isochores , dna regions with high density of gene - coding regions . by coarse graining the alphabet at the pu - py level ,",
    "the latter frequencies become very close : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , information on possible presence of isochores faints .",
    "alternatively , by refining the alphabet , for example by considering explicitly the frequencies of doublets , triplets etc . , information on finer and finer scales emerge , which can not be adherent from superpositions of previous levels of observation .",
    "this is one of the main elements which leads one to characterize this molecules as complex , since different levels of complexity appear when varying the scale of observation .    for conciseness ,",
    "we denote from now on purines and pyrimidines as states 1 and 2 respectively in the two - letter alphabet and @xmath10 as states 1,2,3,4 respectively in the four - letter alphabet . in table",

    "in particular , @xmath15 , the probability of encountering @xmath16 after @xmath17 is noticeably smaller than the others .",

    "the value 0.5 is a border case , where the values are either completely uncorrelated or their correlations decay exponentially fast to zero .    to apply the concept of the hurst exponent in dna sequences ( or any symbol sequence in general ) we map the nucleotides ( symbols ) to numbers . for the calculations we use the two - letter alphabet @xmath28 notation , to conform with the previous analysis on the exit distance distributions and the mapping takes the form : @xmath29",
    "thus the symbol sequence turns into a corresponding numerical sequence , which carries all the information on the position of symbols .",
    "@xmath25 is then directly calculated from the numerical series and is a significant measure which expresses the tendency of symbols to repeat themselves ( persistence ) or to alternate ( antipersistence ) down the sequence .",

    "the value calculated for the hurst exponent is @xmath40 and is clearly distinct from that of the random sequence with the same letter frequency as the data .",
    "calculations of the hurst exponent in other human contigs give very similar @xmath25-values .",

    "dna , a complex multicomponent structure which has evolved during billions of years in close contact with an ever - changing environment , can not be described or constructed based on a closed functional expression with a limited number of parameters .",
    "statistical constructive methods or methods based on chaotic dynamics have been used since the early 1990 to create long nucleotide sequences with statistical properties mimicking those of specific dna molecules @xcite .",
    "all these attempts predict well some of the sequence properties but they fail in others and one needs to add an increasing number of parameters to probe into the structure s local details , even from the statistical point of view . in the present section we propose a novel , global statistical construction method based on the exit distance distribution of the dna sequence described in sec .",
    "[ sec : exit - distances ] , to generate two- and four - letter sequences with statistical properties basically identical with the ones of the original dna data .",

    "if @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) then the sequence is extended by @xmath24 units of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) .",
    "the algorithm returns to step 2 in order to make alternating additions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 clusters .",
    "the algorithm stops when the size of the artificially constructed sequence is equal to the size of the natural dna contig .",
    "the artificial sequences created with the rejection sampling method are constructed to respect perfectly the exit distance distributions of the natural sequence .",
    "they possess all other statistical properties of the natural sequence as well , since the knowledge of the exit distance distribution alone is sufficient to carry out the construction .",
    "in particular , exit from a given state implies automatically entrance to the complementary state in the two - letter alphabet .",
    "the situation is different in the four - letter case . here , one more assumption needs to be made regarding the alternation between the four symbols .",
    "our procedure is based on the transition probabilities @xmath18 between the different letters as were presented in table [ table:2.1 ] and implies thus the assumption that higher order transition probabilities are not accounted for at this stage .    in fig .",

    "this difference reflects the functional role of natural dna sequence , as opposed to the statistical character of the artificial dna .",
    "the nucleotides in a natural sequence need to control the information about neighbouring positions , since what dictates their functionality is their precise ( not statistical ) juxtaposition .",

    "in this study the structure of global human chromosomal sequences has been analyzed using ideas and tools from nonlinear dynamics , information and complexity theories and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "we have established a connection between these properties and the generation of long - range correlations and the processing of information along the sequence , using a series of entropy - like quantities .",
    "we have introduced the exit and recurrence distance distributions , two new indicators of the complexity underlying the sequence , whose evaluation revealed a number of interesting features of its global structure . finally we have designed an algorithm generating sequences that share the statistical properties of natural dna , local as well as global , on the sole basis of the exit distance distribution . the results reported pertain to human chromosome 20 .",
    "other chromosomes ( 10 , 14 and 22 ) have been tested and shown to lead to similar conclusions .",
    "the approach initiated in this work opens some interesting and worth - exploring perspectives .",
    "a first line of approach would be to apply the ideas of asymmetry , irreversibility and information processing considered here in a global perspective to particular dna building blocks such as coding dna , non - coding dna , repeats , etc .",
    "another case to consider are higher eukaryotes , whose genomes share with human genome the existence of genes separated by long non - coding regions containing a high concentration of repeats .",
    "similarly , in the spirit of comparative genomics , it would be interesting to apply the ideas developed here on organisms with intrinsically different genomic structure such as prokaryotes versus eukaryotes .",
    "finally , a quantitative comparison between the local and global statistical properties of the human genome derived in this work and those of the genome of higher mammals and especially of primates could lead to striking evolutionary insights .",
