    "star formation takes place in giant molecular clouds where collapse of small embedded cloud cores is triggered by external mechanisms such as shock waves or stellar winds . for nonrotating cloud cores ,",
    "our understanding of the star formation process is well in - hand .",
    "however , it is clear that in general , rotation must be taken into account .",
    "observations show that molecular cloud cores typically have specific angular momenta @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 s@xmath10 ( _ e.g. , _ see tohline 2002 ) .",
    "clouds with such high specific angular momenta can not collapse directly into stars .",
    "only a few percent of the cloud matter , that nearest the rotation axis , goes directly into the formation of the central object ; the rest forms a massive circumstellar disk ( _ e.g. , _ see shu , adams , & lizano 1987 , tohline 2002 ) .",
    "star formation thus hinges on how mass from the disk finds its way onto the nascent star . molecular viscosity as a mechanism is ineffective at transport of angular momentum in astrophysical disks .",
    "other mechanisms are needed to enhance transport above that which results from binary particle collisions ( armitage 2011 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic and/or magnetohydrodynamic nonaxisymmetric instabilities have been proposed as ways to supply the needed dissipation , either directly through wave transport or indirectly as mechanisms that generate turbulence which supplies the needed effective viscosity ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "we model the redistribution of angular momentum through global nonaxisymmetric hydrodynamic instabilities in this and follow - up papers .",
    "recent reviews of the fluid mechanics involved in young stellar objects by shariff ( 2009 ) and armitage ( 2011 ) include summaries of observed characteristics of various classes of objects , as well as discussions of various mechanisms involved , focusing on magnetic field effects , radiation transport and turbulence .",
    "the stability of nonmagnetic disks has been of interest since the late nineteenth century when dyson ( 1893 ) first investigated what he called _",
    "anchor rings_. as with many systems in physics , the stability analyses began with simplified models , adding increasing complexity over time .",
    "serious attempts at the stability analysis of non - self - gravitating thick disks began with papaloizou & pringle ( 1984 , 1985 ) who studied isentropic disks with power law differential rotation .",
    "they made the important discovery that disks may be dynamically unstable to global nonaxisymmetric modes with azimuthal dependence given by @xmath11 .",
    "for the special cases of a thin cylindrical shell and a thin isothermal ring , a threshold of instability was found for low-@xmath6 modes and slender tori such that disks were found to be unstable for a range of angular momentum profiles . for disks with power law",
    "angular rotation distributions with exponent @xmath0 , kelvin - helmholtz - like instabilities were found to dominate disks for low @xmath0 while sonic instability dominates systems near a constant specific angular momentum profile , @xmath12 .",
    "these sonic instabilities were later named p modes .",
    "papaloizou & pringle ( 1987 ) subsequently performed work on higher order modes , studying modes trapped near the inner and outer disk boundaries by an evanescent region around corotation , modes for which the fluid speed equals the speed of the perturbation .",
    "kojima ( 1986 , 1989 ) further analyzed non - self - gravitating isentropic thick disks for @xmath0 @xmath13 2 and @xmath1 @xmath13 0 , 1.5 , and 3.0 , where @xmath1 is the polytropic index .",
    "kojima found the disks were unstable for almost all cases calculated and that the growth rate decreased for either sufficiently large or small radial widths , and also decreased with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the growth rates showed little dependence on compressibility , with only small differences between his @xmath1 @xmath13 1.5 and @xmath1 @xmath13 3.0 calculations .",
    "the effect of self - gravity was first included in the analytic and numerical investigations of long wavelength modes found in slender , incompressible tori by goldreich , goodman & narayan ( 1986 ) . their theory used a thin ribbon approximation to investigate the two - dimensional incompressible limit of the narrow torus .",
    "they showed that two new modes emerged , one with corotation at the density maximum , called the j mode ( for the jeans instability ) and a second with corotation outside the ribbon , called the i mode ( intermediate between p and j modes ) .",
    "goodman & narayan ( 1988 ) further investigated i modes and j modes adding self - gravity to their calculations of 3d slender incompressible tori with @xmath0 @xmath13 2 and two - dimensional slender incompressible tori with varying @xmath0 .",
    "they found that i and j modes were strongly influenced by self - gravity showing character different from the p modes .",
    "papaloizou & lin ( 1989 ) used a variational principle approach to study thin ( flat ) self - gravitating disks .",
    "they found modes which fell into three categories determined by the distribution of vortensity ( see also papaloizou & savonije 1991 ) .",
    "one kind of mode is associated with extrema in vortensity , corresponding to a disk where corotation is located at the radius of the maximum density .",
    "a second mode depicts modes generated by the gradient of vortensity on the disk boundaries , corresponding to the existence of the corotation radius outside the disk .",
    "a third mode is associated with internal variations in the vortensity gradient .",
    "these modes show corotation inside the disk , but not necessarily at the density maximum .    an important development in the study of disks occurred when adams , ruden , & shu ( 1989 ) showed that the _ indirect _ stellar potential could couple the star and disk , and drive one - armed spiral modes , @xmath6 = 1 modes in disks .",
    "symmetry arguments showed that multi - armed modes with @xmath14 could not drive the central star off the disk center of mass and so could not contribute to the indirect stellar potential .",
    "adams , ruden & shu ( 1989 ) found that @xmath15 modes were unstable for high mass disks ( @xmath16 @xmath17 1 ) , attributing instability to sling amplification ( however , see heemskerk , papaloizou , & savonije 1991 ) .",
    "noh , vishniac & cochran ( 1992 ) studied @xmath15 modes in keplerian ( @xmath18 ) disks for high and low disk masses with emphasis on sensitivity to the outer disk boundary conditions .",
    "they found that low mass disks , down to @xmath19 , were unstable to @xmath15 modes only when a reflecting outer boundary existed , with growth rates increasing rapidly with an increase in disk mass and that there were two types of @xmath15 modes ( see also hadley & imamura 2011 ) .",
    "mathematically simple systems , such as infinitesimally thin disks , self - gravitating annuli and tori with constant mass density and circular cross - sections , have been studied extensively .",
    "fully 3d , self - gravitating disks have received much less attention .",
    "self - gravitating polytropic disks were analyzed by eriguchi & hachisu ( 1983 ) and hachisu & eriguchi ( 1985a , 1985b ) .",
    "tohline & hachisu ( 1990 ) performed nonlinear calculations for @xmath1 @xmath13 1.5 , varying @xmath0 , for extremely small mass stars , @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath16 @xmath21 @xmath22 , making these disks fully self - gravitating . their analysis included eight models but was extended in a second paper , woodward , tohline & hachisu ( 1994 ) where a more extensive study was performed , this time including models where the star - to - disk ratio was much larger .",
    "hadley & imamura ( 2011 ) , performed linear stability analyses on self - gravitating toroids , @xmath16 @xmath13 0.0 .",
    "in addition , they modeled the early nonlinear evolution using a quasi - linear theory and , for selected models , fully nonlinear techniques . in our present work , we perform an extensive study of nonaxisymmetric global instabilities in thick , self - gravitating star - disk systems creating a large catalog of star / disk systems covering most of the parameter space relevant to protostellar and protoplanetary systems . we consider star / disk systems for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , for star masses of @xmath26 and inner to outer edge aspect ratios of @xmath27 .",
    "we discuss how the trends found in the non - self - gravitating disks and thin disks systems carry over to self - gravitating thick disks , as well as how the extra degree of freedom leads to new behavior .",

    "later works showed that a gravitational quadrupole moment ( as expected for the rapidly rotating stars in be systems ) overcame pressure effects and led to disks with prograde @xmath6 = 1 oscillations .",

    "at the lower end of the parameter range , @xmath6 = 1 modes are retrograde .",
    "for the higher @xmath16 end of the range , @xmath6 = 1 modes switch to prograde for small @xmath63 , that is , when self - gravity and pressure forces in the disk are weaker , @xmath6 = 1 modes may be prograde whereas when the disk self - gravity and pressure forces are stronger , @xmath6 = 1 modes are retrograde .",

    "we considered the indirect potential as an expansion of the point mass potential where the position of the star was treated as a perturbation in that the magnitude of the perturbed stellar position , @xmath310 , was assumed to be much smaller than the radius of the inner edge of the disk , @xmath186 . in our first - order calculation , the orbiting star interacted with the unperturbed disk and the perturbed disk interacted with the unperturbed star . in this way , we self - consistently followed linear growth of @xmath6 = 1 disk modes . for disk modes with @xmath6 @xmath164 2 , no coupling occurs . however , once the @xmath6 = 1 mode reaches nonlinear amplitude , the indirect potential may then couple strongly to stable disk modes and drive @xmath6 @xmath164 2 instabilities in the disk .",
    "this could have implications for the nature of the angular momentum transport that arises from @xmath6 = 1 modes .",

    "another mode of interaction between the star and disk could come from coupling of internal stellar modes and disk modes .",
    "such interactions have not been studied except in a handful of investigations , and , even then , the studies were in the context of star / disk coupling which drove secular instability in the central star and not instability in the surrounding disk .",

    "the coupling torque was based on the approximation that the disk was thin and the coupling arose from the excitation of spiral waves at the the lindblad and corotation resonances in the disk ( see papaloizou & terquem 2006 ) .",
