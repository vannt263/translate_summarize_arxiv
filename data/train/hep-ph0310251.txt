    "it is possible to describe the eos of hot qcd at vanishing quark chemical potential @xmath1 to good approximation by the eos of a gas of quasiparticles with thermally generated masses , incorporating confinement effectively by a temperature - dependent , reduced number of thermodynamically active degrees of freedom .",
    "this method is briefly outlined in this section . for a more detailed discussion",
    "the reader is referred to ref.@xcite .",

    "as long as the spectral function at lower temperatures resembles qualitatively this asymptotic form , a quasiparticle description is expected to be applicable .",

    "the functional dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath42 is based on the conjecture that the phase transition is second order or weakly first order which suggests an almost power - like behavior @xmath43 with some critical exponent @xmath44 .",
    "it is assumed that the pseudocritical form of the effective coupling constant given in equation ( [ ecc ] ) also provides the correct approximate expression for the effective quark mass .",
    "this is supported by a non - perturbative dispersion relation analysis for a thermal quark interacting with the gluon condensate @xcite .",
    "+ close to @xmath13 the picture of a non - interacting gas is not appropriate because the driving force of the transition , the confinement process , is not taken into account .",
    "below @xmath13 , the relevant degrees of freedom are pions and other hadrons .",
    "approaching @xmath13 from below , deconfinement sets in and the quarks and gluons are liberated , followed by a sudden increase in entropy and energy density .",
    "conversely , when approaching the phase transition from above , the decrease in the thermodynamic quantities is not primarily caused by increasing masses of the quasiparticles , but by the reduction of the number of thermally active degrees of freedom due to the onset of confinement .",
    "for example , gluons begin to form heavy clusters ( glueballs ) , so that the gluon density gets reduced as @xmath13 is approached from above .",
    "this feature can be incorporated in the quasiparticle picture by modifying the number of effective degrees of freedom by a temperature dependent confinement factor @xmath45 :    @xmath46-\\frac{t_c}{t}\\right ) \\label{confinement_function}.\\ ] ]    the confinement factor is taken to be universal .",

    "the quasiparticle model reviewed in the previous section accurately reproduces lattice thermodynamical quantities such as the pressure , the energy density and the entropy density in the temperature range @xmath67 at vanishing chemical potential @xcite .",
    "however , many physical questions , e.g. the structure of quark cores in massive neutron stars , the baryon contrast prior to cosmic confinement or the evolution of the baryon number in the mid - rapidity region of central heavy - ion collisions , require a detailed understanding of the eos at non - vanishing quark chemical potential . in this section , a thermodynamically self - consistent extension of the quasiparticle model to finite quark chemical potentials is presented .",

    "+ at vanishing quark chemical potential , it is conjectured from asymptotic freedom that qcd undergoes a phase transition from the hadronic phase to the qgp phase . at extremely high density ,",
    "cold quark matter is necessarily in the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase in which quarks of all three colors and all three flavors form cooper pairs .",
