    "the location and the physical properties of very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emission from relativistic jets are one of the most intriguing questions in astrophysics . the nearby radio galaxy m 87 is a well - known vhe @xmath0-ray emitter since the first identification of tev emission by hegra in 1998/1999 @xcite . thanks to its proximity ( @xmath4  mpc , @xmath5 ; * ? ? ? * ) and a large black hole mass  ( @xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) along with @xcite , although we note that the exact value of @xmath7 in m  87 is still controversial and should be carefully considered .",
    "one can re - scale the values in @xmath3 unit in this paper by multiplying a factor of 2 if @xmath8 is used . ] , the jet structure can be resolved under 100 schwarzschild radii scale ( @xmath3 ) with vlbi observations  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h11 ) , providing a unique opportunity to probe the connection of the vhe @xmath0-ray with the relativistic jet by isolating the detailed substructures .",
    "recently there have been three remarkable vhe flares from m  87 ; the events in 2005 , 2008 and 2010 . in the 2005 event  @xcite , the vhe flare was accompanied by radio - to - x - ray flares from hst-1 , a peculiar knot located at a de - projected distance of at least @xmath1120  pc downstream of the nucleus  @xcite15@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the recent optical polarization study of hst-1 supports this trend  @xcite . ] , with the emergence of superluminal ( @xmath1@xmath10 ) radio features  @xcite .",
    "these lead to the strong argument that the vhe emission originates in hst-1  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there are still some debates on this interpretation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of the 2008 event , on the other hand , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ detected an enhanced x - ray flux from the nucleus , while hst-1 maintained a comparatively constant flux .",
    "in addition , synchronized vlba observations at 43  ghz revealed a strong flux increase from the radio core that lasted the subsequent @xmath1two months . these provide evidence that the vhe flare in 2008 originates in the core  @xcite .",
    "the third one occurred more recently , in april 2010 , where the vhe flare has been clearly detected during the joint monitoring campaign by h.e.s.s , veritas and magic  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a12 ) .",
    "the detected flare displays a smooth rise and decay in flux with a peak around mjd 55296 ( 2010 april 9 - 10 ) , reaching a historic high state of about 20% of the flux of the crab nebula .",
    "interestingly , _",
    "observations taken @xmath13 days after the peak of the vhe flare detected an enhanced flux from the nucleus , whereas hst-1 remained in a low state  @xcite .",
    "short time scales of variabilities observed at vhe and x - ray suggest the size of the emitting region to be of the order of a few light days times the doppler factor @xmath11 , which corresponds to less than @xmath110@xmath12 .",
    "we note , however , that a detailed study on hst-1 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g12 ) confirmed a recurrence of this structure and its possible connection with the vhe activity .    while the broad band light curve is studied in a12 , in this letter we report on the detailed radio status of the m  87 jet during the 2010 vhe flaring event obtained from high - resolution vlba observations .",
    "we especially focus on the multi - frequency observations which succcessfully synchronized with this event , providing a wealth of information for hst-1 and the inner jet during the flare on milliarcsecond ( mas ) scale .",
    "the data and the analysis are described in the next section .",
    "we then show the results in section  3 . in the final section",
    ", we discuss the obtained results and make a summary . in the present paper , the spectral index @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "m  87 was observed with the vlba at 2 , 5 , 8 , 15 , 22 and 43  ghz on april 8 and 18 2010 ( mjd  55294 and 55304 ) , which are just before and after the date of the maximum flux of the vhe flare ( mjd  55296 ) .",
    "these data , which were not presented in a12 except for the results of the hst-1 flux at 2  ghz , are identical to those presented in  h11 , where we investigated the core shift of m  87 using the phase - referencing technique relative to the nearby radio source m  84 .",
    "the details of the observations and the data reduction processes including the astrometric analysis are described in h11 . for this paper",
    "we partly re - analysed the data in order to properly examine the radio status of m  87 including the hst-1 region , which is located @xmath1900  mas away from the phase - tracking center .",
    "the data were averaged only to 5  s in time and kept individual channels ( 1  mhz width ) separated before imaging process to avoid time / bandwidth smearing effects at the location of hst-1 .",
    "in addition , we also analysed many available vlba archival data at 43 and 22  ghz to investigate the lightcurve of the inner jet region around the vhe flare ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "these consist of the data on january 18 ( 22  ghz ) , april 4 ( 22  ghz ) , may 1 ( 22  ghz ) , may 15 ( 22  ghz ) and may 30 ( 22 and 43  ghz ) 2010 , which were not included yet in a12 .",
    "images were created in difmap software with iterative phase / amplitude self - calibration .",
    "several weighting schemes were used depending on the target region . in figure",
    "[ fig : image ] we summarize representative images of the m  87 jet obtained by our observations .",
    "the hst-1 region was detected on both epochs at 2 and 5  ghz on a level of 12@xmath15 and 7@xmath15 image rms , respectvely . at 8  ghz ,",
    "the analysis combined for both epochs with a relatively strong @xmath16-tapering detected this region with @xmath18@xmath15 .",
    "the feature was not detected at 15 , 22 and 43  ghz due to the image sensitivity limit .",
    "a part of the hst-1 properties in these epochs ( i.e. the distance from the core and the position angle of the hst-1 region at 2  ghz ) is already reported in g12 in the context of the long - term kinematic study of this feature .",
    "the overall structure observed in these epochs is similar to that on 2010.07 , the image for which is presented in g12 .",
    "the hst-1 region is resolved into two main subfeatures with an overall extension of @xmath140  mas at 2  ghz .",
    "model fitting with two gaussian components yields the sizes of these features as @xmath118  mas ( 1.5  pc , 2.5@xmath17  @xmath3 ) and @xmath116  mas ( 1.3  pc , 2.2@xmath17  @xmath3 ) for the upstream / downstream components , respectively .",
    "while the emergence of a new component from hst-1 upstream is discovered in the later epochs of 2010  ( g12 ) , such a feature is not found yet in our observations on april 8 and 18 . the brightness temperature for the brightest component is estimated to be @xmath1@xmath18  k , which is similar to the upper limit of @xmath19  k derived in the previous study at 15  ghz  @xcite    in figure  [ fig : hst1spec ] , we show the integrated radio spectrum of the hst-1 region in these epochs .",
    "the hst-1 region shows a steep spectrum with an averaged spectral index of @xmath20 , indicating that the emission region is optically thin .",
    "this radio spectral index seems to be slightly steeper than the values for the optical bands ( @xmath21 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which were measured between 2002 and 2007 .",
    "the spectral shapes are quite similar between these two epochs and no significant flux variation was found within the errors .",
    "the magnitudes of the flux densities in these epochs appear to follow the long - term , monotonically - decaying trend that continues since the maximum phase in 2005 .",
    "these observational characteristics at the radio frequencies are consistent with no signs of enhanced activities in hst-1 at x - ray during 2010  ( a12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inner jet region was clearly detected at all frequecies during the vhe flaring phase .",
    "this region is characterized by the compact core with the edge - brightended structure as seen in the 43-ghz image in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "similar images are obtained when images are created separately for april 8 and 18 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : core_curve ] , we show the light curve of the inner jet region at 43 and 22  ghz around the 2010 flaring event .",
    "this is an updated version of the 43-ghz light curve presented in a12 , where the data points analysed here were not included yet .",
    "based on @xcite and a12 , the fluxes for three different regions are provided ;",
    "( i ) the peak flux when convolved with a beam of @xmath22  mas in p.a.@xmath23 at 43  ghz or @xmath24  mas in p.a.@xmath25 at 22  ghz , ( ii ) the nucleus ( the deconvolved flux in the circular region with radius 1.2  mas = 0.1  pc , centered on the intensity peak ) , ( iii ) the flux integrated along the jet between distances of 1.2 and 5.3  mas from the intensity peak .",
    "we assign 5% errors for all of the data points because the amplitude calibration of the vlba is typically accurate within this uncertainty .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : core_curve ] , the inner jet region shows a relatively moderate flux evolution around the vhe flare . near the date of the vhe flux peak , the innermost region ( i ) ( and also ( ii ) ) tends to be at a slightly higher flux level ( @xmath110% both at 22 and 43  ghz ) compared with the other epochs .",
    "this is in contrast to the event in 2008 , where the 43-ghz core underwent a remarkable flux increase ( up to @xmath130% ) lasting the subsequent @xmath1two months together with a flux enhancement from the x - ray core  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : core_spec ] , we next show the radio spectra of the inner jet on april 8 and 18 for the three regions .",
    "note that , regarding the peak fluxes at 22 and 43  ghz , the data have all been convolved with a 22-ghz beam to match the spatial resolutions .",
    "the spectra of each region looks the quite similar between april 8 and 18 .",
    "we found the following spectral characteristics as a function of the measured region ; the spectra gradually change from steep to flat toward the upstream side ( @xmath26 at ( iii ) to @xmath27 at ( ii ) ) , and the spectrum of the innermost region ( i ) becomes slightly inverted between 22 and 43  ghz with @xmath28 , indicating that region ( i ) is optically thick at these frequencies .",
    "this is consistent with the detection of the core shift reported in h11 , because this effect occurs only when the core represents an opaque part of synchrotron emission at each frequency .",
    "for some of other radio sources , their inverted radio cores are caused by foreground free - free absorption  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but that does not seem to be the case for m  87  @xcite .",
    "the measured frequency dependence of the core shift @xmath29 by h11 is in good agreement with @xmath30 , which is typically expected when the core is dominated by synchrotron - self - absorption  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : core_pos ] , we finally show the difference of the core shift ( in ra direction ) between these two epochs ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) . because the detected core shifts on april 8 and 18 are quite similar each other , we did not find any significant time evolution of the core position over the all observed frequencies .",
    "the result at 43  ghz , where the measurement attains the highest position accuracy , indicates that the core position remains stable on a level of 4  @xmath3 ( projected scale on the sky ) during this period . a similar result is reported during the vhe flare in 2008  ( not more than @xmath16  @xmath32 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the location and the physical properties of the vhe @xmath0-ray emission of m  87 are still under hot debate .",
    "the core and hst-1 are currently favored as the emitting sites based on the multi - band correlations detected in the 2005 and 2008 events respectively . in the case of the 2010 flare discussed here , _",
    "chandra _ detected an enhanced x - ray flux from the nucleus during the vhe flare , while hst-1 remains low state  @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the 2008 case .",
    "the observed timescales of short variability at vhe / x - ray suggest the size of the emitting region to be less than @xmath110@xmath12 .",
    "these lead to the argument that the 2010 vhe flare probably originates in the innermost jet region , at least within the resolution element of _ chandra _ @xmath33 .    at the radio bands",
    ", we did not find remarkable activities both in the inner jet and hst-1 during this event .",
    "however , the obtained results tend to favor the above interpretation rather than the hst-1 origin . for the hst-1 region , we did not find any compact sub - components that could account for the small emitting volume suggested from the rapid vhe / x - ray variabilities . from the observed optically thin radio spectra of hst-1 , one can expect simultaneous correlation between radio and vhe if the 2010 event originates in this feature , but instead the radio flux is constantly decreasing .",
    "the discovery of a new component at the hst-1 upstream in 2010 is particulary intriguing ( g12 ) , but the timing of its appearance seems to be slightly offset from the vhe event .",
    "the radio core , on the other hand , remains very compact during this period .",
    "gaussian model fitting to the 43-ghz visibility data indicates a deconvolved size of the radio core as @xmath10.12  mas ( 17  @xmath32 ) , which is close to the size of @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , the observed optically thick nature of the radio core is possible to hide or weaken the vhe - related activity at the radio bands , which could be related to the relatively moderate evolution of the radio core flux . a possibility that the jet between the core and hst-1 is the @xmath0-ray emtting source is not completely ruled out because _ chandra _ does not resolve this region .",
    "however , this scenario seems to be problematic because this region is relatively extended compared with the suggested emitting volume , and maintains the optically thin radio spectra with the constant flux density during the vhe flare .",
    "it should be noted that the core shift measurements obtained in these observations locate the 43-ghz radio core position as @xmath120  @xmath3 from the central engine  ( h11 ) .",
    "this implies that the site of the vhe @xmath0-ray associated with the core is not more distant than @xmath35 from the black hole . in this case , the ambient radiation field such as from the accretion flow could absorb the emitted tev photons due to the process of photon(vhe)- photon(ir ) pair creation  @xcite .",
    "however , m  87 has only a weak ir nucleus  ( @xmath36 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so this allows the @xmath0-ray photons up to @xmath120 tev to escape even from within 20  @xmath3 of the black hole  @xcite .",
    "if the vhe flare in 2010 really originates in the core , one should explain the reason for the distinct behaviour of the radio - to-@xmath0-ray correlation between 2008 and 2010 .",
    "one possibility is the difference of the opacity at the radio bands between 2008 and 2010 due to the change of magnetic field strength . assuming that the emitting plasma is spherical and uniformly magnetized , one can estimate the magnetic field strength through the condition of synchrotron - self - absorption ( ssa ) as @xmath37  gauss , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath11 give the angular size of the emitting region in mas , the ssa turnover frequency in ghz , the flux density at @xmath39 in jy  @xcite . adopting @xmath41  mas , @xmath42  ghz ,",
    "@xmath43  jy , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is estimated to be @xmath46  2.0  g. in the case of the 2008 flare , on the other hand , a time - dependent modeling of the 43-ghz core light curve based on ssa indicates a relatively moderate magnetic field strength as @xmath10.5  g  @xcite . if we assume that the other parameters maintain roughly the same values between 2010 and 2008 , this yields @xmath4735  ghz , resulting in the 43-ghz core to be partially optically thin in 2008 .",
    "thus , more amount of the radio emission is possible to escape from the @xmath0-ray emitting site , leading to the stronger radio / vhe correlation in the 2008 case .    the radiative cooling due to synchrotron emission is also possible to contribute the weaker activity of the radio core in 2010 because of its relatively stronger magnetic field .",
    "the time scale of the synchrotron cooling at a frequency @xmath48 can be estimated as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath45 and @xmath48 are measured in year , gauss and ghz  @xcite .",
    "the cooling time scale of the 43-ghz emission @xmath51 under @xmath52  gauss results in @xmath53  20  days .",
    "this time scale is comparable to the duration of the possible decaying pattern of the radio core flux ( seen for the region ( i ) between mjd  55295 and mjd  55332 ) .",
    "while various @xmath0-ray production models for the black hole vicinity / jet formation region are proposed  @xcite , it is not easy to discriminate such models in these observations alone . to constrain the exact location and match the @xmath0-ray emission process to a specific model",
    ", the use of higher frequency vlbi  @xcite is promising , which provides higher transparency to the @xmath0-ray emitting region with an event horizon scale resolution .",
