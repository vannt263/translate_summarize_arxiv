    "[ fig : fig04 ] , we propose a cross - bridge model to explain the unique conduction mechanism for both graphene and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 surfaces in real space .    in the case of graphene ,",

    "similarly , the bond order among se1 atoms on the surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 can also be viewed as a @xmath37@xmath2-bond on a time - average basis , although the @xmath2-bond trimer is constantly shifting between the two choices of clockwise and counterclockwise rotation discretely in time , centered on each se1 atom .",
    "it is also interesting to note that such a cross - bridge model has been applied in the field of biomechanics to explain the continuous sliding function of muscles .",

    "[ fig : fig04 ] .",
    "this type of electricity transport does not require actual itinerant electron carrier movement , only local @xmath2-bond bonding energy exchange .",
    "third , analogous to the transverse wave in water , the locality of @xmath2-electrons can be viewed in parallel to the hydrogen - bond coupling among water molecules . unless there exists a @xmath2-bond that is local and with weak bonding energy , such an energy relay mechanism would not be possible .",
    "the bonding / nonbonding mechanism of the @xmath2-bond loses no energy in the energy relay process when considering the initial and final states only , i.e. , @xmath38 thermodynamically , which is in agreement with the quantum tunneling description for the massless dirac fermions.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have constructed a hybrid orbital model for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 based on crystal symmetry , atomic coordination , and the outer - shell electrons .",
    "the @xmath2-bond trimer for se on each quintuple layer unit can be used to successfully explain the gapped semiconducting behavior for the bulk and the conducting surface .",
    "we believe this real space view from a chemical bond perspective should be complimentary to the understanding of topological insulator that has often been approached previously using the quantum spin hall effect and band topology .",
    "the chemical bond approach could help us design additional topological insulators more intuitively and shift our focus to materials containing an open conjugated system that is constructed with @xmath2-bonds on the surface .",
    "it is clear that more experimental works are necessary to trace phenomena related to the existence and behaviors of @xmath2-bonds , especially more theoretical works to bridge the real and reciprocal views of topological insulators in parallel to graphene .",
