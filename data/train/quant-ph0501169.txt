    "the notion of a _ quantum random walk _ has emerged as an important element in the development of efficient quantum algorithms . in particular",
    ", it makes a dramatic appearance in the most efficient known algorithm for element distinctness  @xcite .",
    "the technique has also provided simple separations between quantum and classical query complexity  @xcite , improvements in mixing times over classical walks  @xcite , and some interesting search algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the basic model has two natural variants , the _ continuous _ model of childs , et al .",
    "@xcite , on which we will focus , and the _ discrete _ model introduced by aharonov , et al .  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to szegedy s  @xcite article for a more detailed discussion . in the continuous model , a quantum walk on a graph @xmath0 is determined by the time - evolution of the schrdinger equation using @xmath1 as the hamiltonian , where @xmath2 is the laplacian of the graph and @xmath3 is a positive scalar to which we refer as the `` jumping rate '' or `` energy '' .",
    "in addition to being a physically attractive model , it has been successfully applied to some algorithmic problems as indicated above .",
    "such walks have been studied over a variety of graphs with special attention given to cayley graphs , whose algebraic structure has provided immediate methods for determining the spectral resolution of the linear operators that determine the system s dynamics . once it had been discovered that quantum random walks can offer improvement over their classical counterparts with respect to such basic phenomena as mixing and hitting times , it was natural to ask how robust these walks are in the face of decoherence , as this would presumably be an issue of primary importance for any attempt at implementation  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we study the effects of a natural notion of decoherence on the hypercubic quantum walk .",
    "our notion of decoherence corresponds , roughly , to independent measurement `` accidentally '' taking place in each coordinate of the walk at a certain rate @xmath4 .",
    "we discover that for values of @xmath4 beneath a threshold depending on the energy of the system , the walk retains the basic features of the non - decohering walk ; these features disappear beyond this threshold , where the behavior of the classical walk is recovered .",
    "moore and russell  @xcite analyzed both the discrete and the continuous quantum walk on a hypercube .",
    "kendon and tregenna  @xcite performed a numerical analysis of the effect of decoherence in the discrete case . in this article , we extend the continuous case with the model of decoherence described above . in particular , we show that up to a certain rate of decoherence , both linear instantaneous mixing times and linear instantaneous hitting times still occur . beyond the threshold ,",
    "however , the walk behaves like the classical walk on the hypercube , exhibiting @xmath5 mixing times .",
    "as the rate of decoherence grows , mixing is retarded by the quantum zeno effect .",
    "consider the continuous quantum walk on the @xmath6-dimensional hypercube with energy @xmath3 and decoherence rate @xmath4 , starting from the initial wave function @xmath7 , corresponding to the corner with hamming weight zero .",
    "we prove the following theorems about this walk .    when @xmath8 , the walk has instantaneous mixing times at @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , @xmath11 . at these times , the total variation distance between the walk distribution and the uniform distribution is zero .",
    "this result is an extension of the results in  @xcite , and an improvement over the classical random walk mixing time of @xmath5 .",
    "note that the mixing times decay with @xmath4 and disappear altogether when @xmath12 .",
    "further , for large @xmath4 , we will see that the walk is retarded by the quantum zeno effect .    when @xmath8 , the walk has approximate instantaneous hitting times to the opposite corner @xmath13 at times @xmath14 for all @xmath10 , @xmath15 .",
    "however , the probability of measuring an exact hit decays exponentially in @xmath16 ; the probability is @xmath17^n\\enspace.\\ ] ] in particular , when no decoherence is present , the walk hits at @xmath18 and it does so exactly , i.e. @xmath19 . for @xmath12 , no such hitting occurs .",
    "this result is a significant improvement over the exponential hitting times of the classical random walk , with the caveat that decoherence has a detrimental effect on the accuracy of repeated hitting times .",
    "finally , we show that under high levels of decoherence , the measurement distribution of the walk actually converges to the uniform distribution in time @xmath5 , just as in the classical case .    for a fixed @xmath12 ,",
    "the walk mixes in time @xmath5 .    in the remainder of the introduction",
    ", we describe the continuous quantum walk model , and recall the graph product analysis of moore and russell  @xcite . in the second section , we describe our model of decoherence , derive a superoperator that governs the behavior of the decohering walk , and prove that it is decomposable into an @xmath6-fold tensor product of a small system .",
    "we then fully analyze the small system in the third section , and use those results to draw conclusions about the general walk in 3 distinct regimes : @xmath8 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "these regimes are roughly analogous to underdamping , critical damping , and overdamping ( respectively ) of a simple harmonic oscillator with damping rate @xmath4 and angular frequency @xmath22 .",
    "a continuous quantum walk on a graph @xmath0 begins at a distinguished vertex @xmath23 of @xmath0 , the initial wave function of the walk being @xmath24 , where @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "the walk then evolves according to the schrdinger equation . in our case ,",
    "the graph is the @xmath6-dimensional hypercube .",
    "concretely , we identify the vertices with @xmath6-bit strings , with edges connecting those pairs of vertices that differ in exactly one bit .",
    "since the hypercube is a regular graph , we can let the hamiltonian @xmath28 be the adjacency matrix instead of the laplacian  @xcite ; the dynamics are then given by the unitary operator @xmath29 and the state of the walk at time @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "the following analysis makes use of the hypercube s product graph structure ; this structure will be useful again later when we consider the effects of decoherence .",
    "the analysis below diverges from that of moore and russell  @xcite only in that we allow each qubit to have energy @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 .",
    "the energy of the entire system is then @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath34 and let @xmath35 where the @xmath36th term in the sum has @xmath37 as the @xmath36th factor in the tensor product .",

    "we begin by recalling a model of decoherence commonly used in the discrete model , with the intention of deriving a superoperator @xmath39 , acting on density matrices , which mimics these dynamics in our continuous setting . the discrete model , described in  @xcite , couples unitary evolution according to the discrete - time quantum random walk model of aharonov et al .",
    "@xcite with partial measurement at each step occurring with some fixed probability @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , the evolution of the density matrix can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the unitary operator of the walk , @xmath45 runs over the dimensions where the decoherence occurs , and the @xmath46 project in the usual `` computational '' basis  @xcite .    in the continuous",
    "setting , the unitary operator that governs the non - decohering walk is @xmath47 , where @xmath28 is the normalized adjacency matrix of the hypercube times an energy constant . to extend the above decoherence model to this setting ,",

    "this operator will correspond to choosing a coordinate uniformly at random and measuring it by projecting to the computational basis @xmath58 let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the single qubit projectors onto @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",

    "we define @xmath65 similarly , so that @xmath66 ignores all the qubits except the @xmath45th one , and projects it onto @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",

    "the pure continuous quantum walk on the @xmath6-dimensional hypercube is easy to analyze , in part , because it is equivalent to a system of @xmath6 non - interacting qubits .",
    "we now show that , with the model of decoherence described above , each dimension still behaves independently .",
    "in particular , the superoperator that dictates the behavior of the walk is decomposable into an @xmath6-fold tensor product .    recall the product formulation of the non - decohering hamiltonian @xmath70 where @xmath71 with @xmath37 appearing in the @xmath36th place in the tensor product .",

    "we now address each of these three situations in detail .",
    "when @xmath8 , we recover the perhaps most interesting feature of the non - decohering walk : the instantaneous mixing time is linear in @xmath6 . to exactly determine the mixing times for our decohering walk , we solve @xmath96 = p[1 ] = \\frac{1}{2}$ ] ; this amounts to determining when @xmath103\\ ] ] equals zero .",
    "clearly the exponential decay term results in mixing as @xmath104 ; our principle concern , however , is with the periodic mixing times analogous to those of the original walk .",

    "note also that if we let @xmath77 , we have @xmath108 , which are exactly the nice periodic mixing times of the non - decohering walk . in the decohering case , however , these mixing times drift towards infinity , and cease to exist altogether beyond the threshold of @xmath20 .",
    "this proves theorem 1 .",
    "we now wish to determine when our small system is as close as possible to @xmath109 .",
    "since our large - system walk begins at @xmath110 , this will correspond to approximate hitting times to the opposite corner @xmath111 .",

    "a small decrease in the rate @xmath4 can result in drastically different behavior , in this case a return to linear mixing and hitting .",
    "we leave the limiting mixing analysis of this case for the next section , where we develop some relevant tools .",
    "the goal of this section is to show two interesting consequences of the presence of substantial decoherence in the quantum walk on the hypercube .",
    "first , we will show that for a fixed @xmath12 , the walk behaves much like the classical walk on the hypercube , mixing in time @xmath5 .",
    "second , we show that as @xmath120 , the walk suffers from the quantum zeno effect .",
    "informally stated , the rate of decoherence is so large that the walk is continuously being reset to the initial wave function @xmath121 by measurement .",
    "consider a single qubit .",
    "let @xmath122 be the distribution obtained by full measurement at time @xmath30 , and @xmath44 the uniform distribution : @xmath123 where @xmath124.\\ ] ] for @xmath125 , @xmath126 are the analogous product distributions in the @xmath6-dimensional case . to analyze the limiting mixing behavior of the walk",
    ", we will consider the total variation distance @xmath127 between these distributions . in order to give bounds for total variation , we will use _",
    "hellinger distance _",
    "@xcite , defined as follows : @xmath128 we will make use of the following two properties of hellinger distance : @xmath129 and @xmath130 the first property makes it easy to work with product distributions .",
    "the second gives a nice relationship between hellinger distance and total variation distance . in our case , @xmath131 and hence , by ( [ helltv ] ) , @xmath132 consider the walk with decoherence rate @xmath21 .",
    "we have @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath4 are positive and real .",
    "it follows that for a fixed @xmath21 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 as @xmath104 .",
    "hence the walk does indeed mix eventually , and the measurement distribution in fact converges to the uniform distribution .",

    "this shows that the walk mixes in time @xmath5 when @xmath21 .",
    "notice that when @xmath20 , @xmath148 , so that the same technique easily extends to that case via equation ( [ pequals4k ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 3 .",
    "recall from the previous section that the time required to mix when @xmath21 is @xmath149 which clearly increases with @xmath4 .",
    "further , for large @xmath4 , @xmath150 tends to @xmath87 , and hence @xmath116 tends to @xmath151 notice that @xmath152 corresponds to remaining at the initial state forever .",
    "we conclude that the mixing of the walk is retarded by the quantum zeno effect , where measurement occurs so often that the system tends to remain in the initial state .",
