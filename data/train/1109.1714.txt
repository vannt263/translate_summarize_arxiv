    "<S> finally , fault tolerant noisy error correction is applied to the encoded states in the non - equiprobable pauli operator error environment allowing us to compare noisy ( realistic ) and perfect error correction implementations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this maintains the fidelity of the encoded state for certain error - probability values . </S>",
    "<S> these results have implications for when non - fault tolerant procedures may be used in practical quantum computation and whether quantum error correction should be applied at every step in a quantum protocol . </S>"
