    "another difference is that in bulk superfluid @xmath0he , measurements of the momentum distribution have shown that the low - temperature condensate fraction is @xmath1 , with the remainder of the particles in finite momentum states  @xcite , whereas the low - temperature atomic condensates can be prepared with essentially all atoms in the bose condensate .",
    "finally , the condensates of alkali vapors are pure and dilute ( with mean particle density @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , so that the interactions can be accurately parametrized in terms of a scattering length @xmath4 ( in current experiments , alkali - metal - atom becs are much less dense than air at normal pressure ) .",
    "this situation differs from superfluid @xmath0he , where the relatively high density and strong repulsive interactions greatly complicate the analytical treatments . as a result ,",
    "a relatively simple nonlinear schrdinger equation ( the gross - pitaevskii equation ) gives a precise description of the atomic condensates and their dynamics ( at least at low temperatures ) .",
    "one should mention , however , that unlike the spinless @xmath0he atoms , alkali atoms have nonzero hyperfine spins , and various forms of spin - gauge effects can be important  @xcite .",
    "bulk superfluids are distinguished from normal fluids by their ability to support dissipationless flow .",
    "such persistent currents are intimately related to the existence of quantized vortices , which are localized phase singularities with an integer topological charge .",
    "the superfluid vortex is an example of topological defects that are well known in liquid helium  @xcite and in superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of quantized vortices in superfluids has been the object of fundamental theoretical and experimental work  @xcite .",
    "vortex - like excitations exist in the earth s atmosphere @xcite , in superfluid hadronic matter ( neutron stars ) @xcite , and even in rotating nuclei @xcite .",

    "v we investigate the general dynamical behavior of a vortex , based on a time - dependent variational analysis and on the method of matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "the latter method allows us take into account effects of both nonuniform condensate density and vortex curvature .",

    "as the impurities traverse the condensate , they dissipate energy by colliding with the stationary condensate and radiating phonons . when the impurity velocity was reduced below the speed of sound , however , the collision probability decreased dramatically , providing evidence for superfluidity in the condensate .",

    "recently , dissipation in a bose - einstein condensed gas was studied by moving a blue - detuned laser beam through the condensate  @xcite .",

    "numerical simulations of the nonlinear schrdinger equation were used to study the flow field around an object moving through a homogeneous condensate  @xcite . when the object moves faster than a critical velocity @xmath840 , these studies show that the superfluid flow becomes unstable against the formation of quantized vortex lines , which gives rise to a new dissipative regime .",
    "pairs of vortices with opposite circulation are generated at opposite sides of the object .",

    "energetic considerations show that the extra degree of freedom associated with the second component allows a more intricate structure for the free - energy surface . as a result , in a two - component system , it is possible to achieve a local minimum in the free energy at the center of the trap  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a minimum implies the existence of a region of energetic stability where the vortex can not escape and might generate a persistent current .",
    "in this paper , we have provided an introductory description of vortices in trapped bose condensed gases .",
    "the main conclusion of our analysis is that the vortex dynamics in such systems is well described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( at least for low temperatures ) .",

    "we have been able to cover only part of the existing literature on vortices in trapped condensates . among important issues that we have not discussed are : different methods of vortices generation and detection , kinetics of vortex nucleation and decay , vortices in becs with attractive interactions and in fermi condensates , other defects in becs ( solitons , instantons , vortex solitons , skyrmions , wave - function and spin monopoles ) .    in the case of superfluid helium , vortex nucleation",
    "is associated with pinning of vortex lines at the walls of the container .",
    "trapped condensates have no rough surfaces , and the nucleation process of quantized vorticity has a different origin  @xcite . an important question in vortex",
    "nucleation is the role of the thermal component and transverse anisotropy of magnetic traps @xcite .",
    "the literature of the past few years contains many different proposals for the creation of vortices in trapped becs , although we considered only a few of them in this review . to illustrate the diversity of different methods ,",
    "let us cite some other schemes .",
    "an experimental setup for vortex creation by berry s phase induced bose - einstein condensation is proposed by olshanii and naraschewski  @xcite .",
    "a related vortex - production scheme employing the aharonov - casher effect is discussed by petrosyan and you  @xcite .",
    "other proposals suggest the creation of the vortex state by opto - mechanical stirring @xcite ; by a rotating force @xcite ; by an adiabatic population transfer of a condensate from the ground to the excited bose - condensed state via a raman transition induced by laser light @xcite ; the accidental generation of vortices in a quench @xcite or in self - interference measurements @xcite .",
    "a possible way to create rotating states from a trapped ground - state bec by using light - induced forces is proposed by marzling and zhang  @xcite .",
    "they show that the dipole potential induced by four traveling - wave laser beams with an appropriate configuration in space , phase and frequency can be used to realize such a system .",
    "vortex states can be trapped in an evaporative cooling process if the evaporation length is less than the size of the thermally excited state @xcite . in order to nucleate vortices ,",
    "the trapped gas can be rotated at temperatures above the bec transition .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that vorticity could be imprinted by imaging a bec through an absorption plate @xcite .",
    "the method consists of passing a far - off - resonant laser pulse through an absorption plate with an azimuthally dependent absorption coefficient , imaging the laser beam onto a bec , and thus creating the corresponding nondissipative stark - shift potential and condensate phase shift .",
    "a vortex ring may be formed by translating one condensate through another one @xcite ( this process is analogous to ring nucleation by moving ions in superfluid @xmath0he @xcite ) , or by three - dimensional soliton decay @xcite .",
    "recently the jila group generated vortex rings by the decay of dark solitons through the snake instability @xcite .",
    "many different proposals for the detection of vortices in becs have been mentioned in literature .",
    "some of them are used in current experiments .",
    "the spatial size of the vortex core in the tf regime is too small to be observed ; for visualizing the vortex state , it was suggested to switch off the trap and let the cloud expand ballistically  @xcite .",
    "after expansion , the size of the vortex core is magnified by approximately the same factor as the size of expanding condensate  @xcite , so that the core becomes observable .",
    "also the vortex state can be detected by the splitting of the collective condensate modes in axisymmetric traps @xcite or by looking at the phase slip in the interference fringes produced by two expanding condensates @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed an interference method to detect vortices by coherently pushing part of the condensate with optically induced bragg scattering .",
    "a detection scheme that reveals the existence of vortex states in a cylindrically symmetric trap is discussed by goldstein , wright and meystre  @xcite .",
    "this scheme relies on the measurement of the second - order correlation function of the schrdinger field and yields directly the topological charge of the vortex state .",
    "also one can detect the vortex state by observing the off - resonance absorption image of the rotational cloud @xcite . for",
    "a vortex state one should expect a bright `` hole '' in the image which accounts for the vortex core in the density distribution .",
    "another possibility is to observe the doppler frequency shift due to the quantized circular motion of the atoms @xcite , or by scattering fast atoms in a pure momentum state off a trapped atomic cloud @xcite .",
    "another question that has recently attracted significant theoretical and experimental interest is the dynamics and stability of dark solitons and vortex solitons in trapped condensates .",
    "solitary waves ( kinks ) have been studied in many physical contexts @xcite and exist in different physical , chemical and biological systems @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies discuss the dynamics and stability of dark solitons @xcite ( the range of parameters where the solitons are dynamically stable has been determined in @xcite , while the theory of dissipative dynamics of a kink at finite temperature condensates has been developed in @xcite ) , as well as suggestions for their creation   @xcite .",
    "recently dark solitons inside a condensate were generated by a phase - imprinting method @xcite .",
    "unlike vortices , dark solitons are not topologically stable . at finite temperature ,",
    "they exhibit thermodynamic and dynamic ( small - amplitude ) instabilities .",
    "the interaction of the soliton with the thermal cloud causes dissipation that accelerates the soliton .",
    "there is an interesting analogy between solitons and relativistic particles , in which the soliton velocity and speed of sound correspond to the particle velocity and speed of light in vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , the kinematic mass of the soliton decreases when its velocity increases .",
    "this behavior is opposite to the case of relativistic particle , where the kinematic mass increases with velocity , and an infinite force is required to accelerate the particle beyond the velocity of light .",
    "in contrast to the particle , the soliton can reach the velocity of sound .",
    "an interesting problem is to create a soliton and a vortex simultaneously ( this object is known as vortex soliton ) .",
    "the vortex soliton has a topological charge and therefore could be stable .",
    "another challenging perspective for future experiments is the creation of vortex - like states in optically confined becs . by relaxing the condition of spin polarization imposed by magnetic trapping , this new method of confinement permits the study of diverse textures that can be formed by the spinor order parameter , like those in superfluid @xmath5he - a @xcite .",
    "also optical traps allow strong variation of the scattering length via feshbach resonances , which provides new possibilities for manipulating the condensate states .    among other challenging problems ,",
    "one should mention measurements of vortex normal modes at higher temperatures , which could establish the connection between the bogoliubov approximation and self - consistent mean field theories . also , it would be interesting to observe vortex dissipation and damping of vortex normal modes .",
