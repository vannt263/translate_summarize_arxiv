    "nsi corrections become particularly relevant , and the experimentally measured values of leptonic mixing angles and cp violating quantities are dramatically different from the vacuum ones . in this sense , the combination of standard neutrino oscillations and nsi effects in the analyses of future neutrino experiments is not only meaningful but also necessary .",
    "in addition to nsis at propagation processes , nsi effects at neutrino sources and detectors play a very important role , since they may induce significant mimicking effects on mixing parameters @xcite or bring in distinguishable zero - distance effects for a near detector @xcite . here",

    "[ sec : effective ] .    although much attention has been paid on the issue of nsis according to different neutrino facilities and projects , the previous analytical investigations are either based on a two - flavor neutrino framework @xcite or an approximation for the three - flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities ( indeed producing lengthy formulas ) .",
    "there are still lack of analytical relations , which can show us the nsi effects on the leptonic mixing parameters in a transparent way .",

    "solid curves correspond to exact results obtained using eq .  , whereas dashed ones represent our perturbative mappings .",
    "in the first row , we can appreciate how the dependence of @xmath192 on @xmath136 is well described by our perturbative result in eq .",
    ", unless @xmath136 assumes a very large value , close to its upper bound @xcite .",
    "in addition , notice that the increase of @xmath192 corresponds to reordering the eigenvalues for energies around 10 gev . in the second row",
    ", we analyze the behavior of @xmath221 , for different values of the relevant parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "in particular , in the first and second panels , we choose only one of them being different from zero ( and equal to @xmath237 ) , whereas in the last one , we allow both of them to assume larger values ( @xmath238 and @xmath239 ) .",
    "the agreement between our calculation and the exact evaluation of @xmath221 is quite good , also in predicting the location of the resonance .",
    "finally , we comment on the fact that @xmath240 is dramatically suppressed by matter effects , as shown in eq .  .",
    "however , since long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are not very sensitive to this angle , we will not perform a detailed analysis here .",
    "the conclusions made above about the dependence of the effective angles on the nsi parameters apply as well to the case of anti - neutrinos in matter and we will not perform such a redundant analysis here .      until now we have described the relevant features of new physics effects on the matrix elements of the leptonic mixing matrix . in",
    "what follows , we study the dependence of the transition probabilities on the nsi parameters , for different choices of neutrino energies and baselines . in particular , we focus on the _ golden channel _ @xmath241 @xcite and the cp asymmetries derived from it , the _ silver channel _ @xmath242 @xcite , and the so - called _ discovery channel _ @xmath243 , which is thought to be the best channel for searching for new physics @xcite .",
    "we also show how the relevant features of the transition probabilities are well reproduced computing them by inserting eqs .  - into eq .",
    ".    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we show the transition probability @xmath244 as a function of the neutrino energy for three different baseline setups : @xmath245 ( around the scope of minos @xcite and opera @xcite ) , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 ( for the two detector setup of a neutrino factory ) .",
    "the input parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in each panel ,",
    "the solid curves denote the exact numerical results , the dashed curves correspond to results derived from our approximate mappings and , to highlight the effects of the nsi parameters , the dotted curves represent the probability without including nsis .",
    "we can observe that our approximate mappings given in sec .",
    "[ sec : expansions ] agree with the exact numerical results to an extremely good precision .",
    "similar to the plots of the mixing parameters , a singularity exists around @xmath248 due to the limitation of non - degenerate perturbation theory that we have elaborated . for smaller @xmath3 ,",
    "the probability is more sensitive to the nsi effects , and thus , longer baseline lengths are more favored for the purpose of searching for new physics effects .    the experimentally measured cp asymmetry in the golden channel , which is usually defined as @xmath249 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] for the same baseline setup .",
    "again , our approximate mappings are valid in a large range of beam energies . at higher energies ,",
    "the cp asymmetries are dramatically affected by nsis , i.e. , the values of @xmath250 , which are calculated without taken into account nsi effects , may go to divergent directions .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] , we repeat the same exercise on the neutrino oscillation probabilities and cp asymmetries , but instead as a function of the baseline length and for two fixed value of the neutrino energy @xmath251 gev and @xmath252 gev .    it can be clearly seen that for smaller @xmath3 and lower beam energy , new physics effects play a significant role around @xmath253 , which sheds some light on future beta beam experiments . for higher energy experiments ,",
    "i.e. , a neutrino factory , a far detector with relatively longer baseline length should be important to constrain nsi effects . in both figures , one can appreciate how the probabilities computed using our approximations for the effective mixing angles are in very good agreement with the exact results .",
    "finally , we illustrate the application of our analytical expressions for the @xmath254 and @xmath255 channels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .    for comparison",
    ", we also show the maximal nsi corrections by setting all the nsi parameters at their upper bounds given in ref .",
    "one can observe that nsi corrections to these two channels are not remarkable if the corresponding @xmath2 s are chosen to be a few percent .",
    "however , increasing the nsi parameters , the nsi effects become more significant , in particular for the @xmath254 channel . the upper plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] indicate that our approximate mappings are not quite valid for relatively longer baseline lengths .",
    "this is due to the fact that our expansions are performed according to small @xmath256 s and can not be extended to the regions of sizable nsi parameters . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "if nsis are related to some underlying new physics , they should be attributed to next - to - leading order effects and not deviate much from zero . in this sense ,",
    "our approximate mappings are quite realistic and should be very helpful for both phenomenological studies and model buildings .    since the analyses above certainly depend on the input nsi parameters , they mainly serve as illustrations . however , our analytical results are model independent .",
    "thus , they are hoped to be very useful for a general study of nsi effects in future experiments .",
    "the transparent mappings also manifest the underlying correlations between leptonic mixing parameters and nsis in a very legible way .",
    "in this work , we have developed both exact and approximate mappings between the leptonic mixing matrix in vacuum and in matter in the presence of nsis .",
    "a full set of sum rules between fundamental mixing parameters and the corresponding effective ones in matter have been derived . by using these sum rules , exact and model independent analytical mappings between the mixing matrix elements @xmath110 and @xmath257",
    "have been established , and in turn using these mappings , the moduli of the mixing matrix elements and the sides of unitarity triangles can be immediately figured out . besides the exact expressions for the mixing parameters , we have also derived approximate parameter mappings based on series expansions in the small parameters @xmath97 , @xmath111 , and @xmath256 .",
    "we have then performed a detailed numerical analysis of the application and validity of our parameter mappings . in particular ,",
    "we have concentrated on the mimicking effects of nsis on the mixing angle @xmath3 and on the deviation of the mixing angle @xmath4 from maximal mixing .",
    "furthermore , we have studied in detail how the @xmath129 s affect the transition probabilities of the @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 channels .",
    "we have found that the exact parameter mappings are very useful in obtaining exact results for the mixing parameters and transition probabilities , and our perturbative parameter mappings also describe quite well all the relevant features of these quantities .",
    "note that our analytical analysis is independent of any specific model or assumptions on the configuration of nsi parameters . in conclusion ,",
    "the outstanding feature of our parameter mappings is that they reveal the underlying correlations between nsi effects and neutrino mixing parameters in a highly straightforward way , and they are very practical and useful for the study of nsis in future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it also makes sense to note that the calculation procedures we have employed in the present work can also be applied to the picture of non - unitary leptonic mixing @xcite , which will be elaborated on elsewhere .",
