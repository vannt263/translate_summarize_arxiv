    "the combination of nonlinearity and discreteness makes possible localized vibrational modes in homogeneous lattices .",
    "such an excitation , called an intrinsic localized mode ( ilm ) @xcite , or discrete breather(db)@xcite , can exist in a lattice of any dimension .",
    "it was shown early on that for an ilm frequency close to the plane wave normal mode spectrum mobility was possible but when far removed from the band it was stationary stable and pinned at a lattice point@xcite .",
    "a peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential barrier is often introduced to characterize the fact that an ilm located halfway between two lattice sites has a different energy than one centered on a lattice site . starting with the work on kink dynamics@xcite in a discrete sine - gordon system",
    ", effort has gone into trying to remove the pn barrier for localized excitations in various discrete 1-d lattices both for practical @xcite and theoretical applications@xcite .",
    "for a zero velocity excitation the pn barrier has been successfully eliminated with specific parameters for 1-d discrete equations of the sine - gordon@xcite , klein - gordon@xcite and nonlinear schrdinger @xcite forms . slowly running ilms",
    "have been shown to exist , in principle , for nonlinear intersite interactions , and for klein - gordon and nonlinear schrdinger systems with specific potentials@xcite .",
    "this has been followed by a broad effort showing that radiationless traveling localized modes can be produced with nonlinear schrdinger equation forms @xcite using specific conditions , such as stability inversion@xcite , saturable nonlinearity@xcite , and a gain - loss mechanism@xcite .",
    "another direction demonstrating localized excitation mobility makes use of the concept of moving embedded solitons ( es ) , where the soliton internal frequency is inside a spectrum of linear modes .",
    "although originally identified for continuous nonlinear optical model systems that support analytical solutions@xcite , there has even been a family of stable es identified where analytical solutions have not been found.@xcite more recently localized excitations have been shown to exist in some discrete nonlinear models where they are referred to as embedded lattice solitons ( els).@xcite the general result is that for either an es or an els to exist there can be no resonance between it and the small amplitude linear waves that are also present .",
    "although much less is known about els a specific example is the demonstration of a two parameter family of exact els for a discrete version of a complex modified korteweg - de vries equation that includes next - nearest - neighbor coupling.@xcite    the recent focus on the resonance interaction in discrete systems between the moving nonlinear localized excitation and the plane wave spectrum as the key element@xcite , rather than the pn barrier itself , has lead us to address the question how best to identify the resonance for strongly localized ilms in discrete nonlinear physical systems where analytic solutions are unknown .",
    "we have found a practical procedure whereby the resonance strength can be readily identified and then , depending on the relative contributions of the different nonlinearities , eliminated .",
    "this is demonstrated for an ilm traveling in a driven and damped 1-d newtonian lattice that contains both onsite and nearest neighbor ( nn ) intersite nonlinear forces .",
    "the approach is to focus attention on the fourier transform ( ft ) of the nonlinear force presented in a 2-d @xmath0 map .",
    "although the driven - damped condition no longer characterizes a mathematically ideal lattice , this complication is compensated by precise measurements obtained for the traveling ilm , including its shape . using these measured shapes simulations",
    "have been carried out for traveling ilms under the same parameter conditions but without the driver or damper .",
    "the end result for both driven and undriven lattices is the discovery of simple specific conditions for a supertransmission channel for traveling ilms .",
    "such discrete equations describe a variety of physical systems ranging from electrical transmission lines@xcite , to micromechanical arrays@xcite , to 1-d antiferromagnets@xcite , to nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides@xcite , and to other systems treated within a tight binding formulation@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we develop the expected features of the 2-d @xmath0 map , firstly for a simple linear traveling pulse in the continuous limit and then for two well known discrete solitons examples , namely , the toda lattice and the ablowitz - ladik model . section  [ chap : body ] begins with mobile ilms in the driven and damped 1-d physical lattice that contains both onsite and nearest neighbor ( nn ) intersite nonlinear forces . by varying the relative strengths of these two contributions the klein - gordon onsite nonlinear force model , the nn intersite nonlinear model and the supertransmission model for both hard and soft nonlinearity can be readily studied .",

    "now the onsite nonlinearity is much more effective than the intersite nonlinearity since @xmath3 is close to zero . in comparing the unturned case with the tuned case note that the initial velocity for the regular lattice is larger than for the tuned case because the added negative nonlinear intersite term of the tuned one reduces its ilm velocity .",
    "the much smaller deceleration observed here for the untuned case than for the other cases shown in fig .",

    "as long as mobile ilms can be generated and the resonance intersection occurs at one location on the @xmath0 map the range of parameter tunability to produce supertransmission extends over most of the plane wave dispersion curve shown in fig .",

    "producing supermobile ilms in or above the top of the plane wave spectrum is straightforward but generating those below the bottom require special care . for cases near @xmath118 or",
    "@xmath119 supermobility is not possible because the velocity is too small and multiple resonances occur in @xmath10 space .",
    "the key element for supertransmission is the presence of at least two nonlinearities , which have opposite sign where the intersection occurs in the @xmath0 map , while the sum of these nonlinearities is large enough at @xmath120 to produce the traveling ilm .",
    "this occurred for the physical equations considered here since the ft components of the nonlinear onsite force always have the same sign while a region of those of the nn nonlinear intersite force have opposite sign .",
    "[ note : a somewhat less physical combination we explored briefly that produced a supermobile ilm involved nn nonlinear forces together with 3rd nn nonlinear forces with a strength ratio of 1.0:0.5 . ]",
    "it should be noted that most physical parameters used in this paper were taken from existing microcantilever arrays but the supertransmission mixing ratios displayed here would require a larger onsite nonlinearity , hence for an experimental demonstration a redesign would be required , such as widening the head of each cantilever .    by simulating traveling ilms in nonintegrable 1d physical lattices with driver and damping combinations , and either hard or soft onsite and intersite nonlinearity",
    ", we have found a way to suppress the resonant interaction between the nonlinear force and the plane wave modes . examining a running ilm , with internal frequency located either outside or inside the plane wave spectrum , in a @xmath0 map",
    "can be used to display the ilm amplitude and nonlinear force components centered on a band tangent to the normal mode dispersion curve . for both kg and nn nonlinear models",
    "we have demonstrated that the signature of a retarded ilm is characterized by a resonance in @xmath0 space where the plane wave dispersion curve and the ft amplitude components of the ilm intersect .",
    "it was discovered that for the nn case nearby the resonance location there is an antiresonance in this ft amplitude spectrum .",
    "we have shown that for situations where both onsite and intersite nonlinearity occur the position of this hole in the nonlinear force spectrum depends on the specific mix of the two nonlinearities . by changing",
    "this mix one can move the nonlinear force hole to the amplitude intersection point , thereby removing the retardation effect for a traveling ilm characterized by a specific frequency and @xmath10-vector .",
    "thus for both driven and un - driven 1-d nonlinear physical lattices with coupling of the kind shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) simple specific conditions have been found for a supertransmission channel for a traveling ilm .",
    "similar supertransmission channel features are to be anticipated for running ilms in 1d physical systems with more complex combinations of onsite and intersite nonlinearities .",
    "because discrete equations of the form studied here characterize a variety of nonlinear transmission lines and other physical systems treated within a tight binding approximation such an engineered , intrinsic , low loss transmission channel is expected to be a very useful property .",

    "the zero nonlinear force contribution at the intersection with the linear dispersion curve is achieved by summing two force components , the nonlinear onsite and intersite terms . to see how this follows it is not necessary to consider the entire nonlinear force spectrum but only to examine the 2-d complex amplitude components along the tangent line in the @xmath0 map .",
    "both nonlinear forces are generated from the three times multiplication of @xmath13 , which is the convolution in reciprocal space .",
