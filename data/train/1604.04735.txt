    "next generation sequencing ( ngs ) technologies paved the way for heterogeneous data extraction from different biological samples .",
    "genomic datasets are of fundamental importance as dna molecules are responsible to encode genetic instructions that are necessary for all the organisms to function .",
    "these datasets are used to recover the exact nucleotide composition of a set of dna molecules , the so called dna sequencing .",
    "sequencing a set of dna molecules can be categorized into two extreme cases . in the first case ,",
    "the dna molecules are evolutionary diverged enough such that it is safe to assume the problem is equivalent to sequencing a single dna molecule with the total length of all the molecules .",
    "an evident example of such scenarios is the presence of numerous chromosomes within a cell which considerably differ from each other in terms of nucleotide content . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "fundamental limits of sequencing of a single dna molecule are obtained .    in the second case ,",
    "dna molecules are sampled from a population of closely related individuals where the molecules mainly differ by single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) .",
    "this paper aims to obtain fundamental limits on the number and length of dna reads where exact reconstruction of all molecules is possible and reliable .",
    "emergence of long dna read technologies in the recent years has provided dna reads with lengths up to almost @xmath0 kilo base - pair ( kbp ) @xcite , @xcite . using long dna reads makes it possible for researchers to go beyond conventional limitations in a variety of computational methods in bioinformatics , such as haplotype phasing and dna read alignment . throughout this paper , sequencing of closely related dna molecules",
    "is called pooled - dna sequencing .    in pooled - dna sequencing ,",
    "the individual molecules may have been pooled by nature or by design .",
    "the former case can be approached by capturing each individual molecule for separate sequencing which is not a cost effective strategy @xcite .",
    "even if the molecules are available separately , in the latter case , the molecules are pooled together to reduce the overall cost of sequencing .",
    "this can be done by reduction in overhead expenses through library preparation of a number of individuals simultaneously @xcite , @xcite .",
    "pooled - dna sequencing has diverse applications in modern biology and medicine . in cancer genomics , exact isolation of healthy tissues from cancerous cells",
    "can not be guaranteed during sample extraction . in sequencing of bacteria populations ,",
    "different colonies can not be easily separated , the so called metagenomics @xcite .",
    "more importantly , in diploid individuals such as humans , somatic cells contain two homologous autosomal chromosomes that need to be sequenced , the so called haplotype phasing @xcite .",
    "computational approaches to the problem of pooled - dna sequencing has several advantages over experimental approaches @xcite , @xcite . on the computational side , a number of similar issues have been addressed in earlier works . here , we consider the ones that are more relevant to this paper .",
    "haplotype phasing is addressed in many papers , mostly through algorithmic approaches ; see @xcite for a review . in @xcite , authors have shown that the optimal algorithm for haplotype assembly can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem . in @xcite , authors have introduced shapeit2 , a statistical tool which adopts a markov model to define the space of haplotypes which are consistent with given genotypes in a whole chromosome . a coverage bound based on the problem from the perspective of decoding convolutional codes is proposed in @xcite .",
    "particlehap is also an algorithm proposed in @xcite to address the assembly problem with joint inference of genotypes generating the most likely haplotypes .",
    "recently , another tool for the haplotype phasing problem using semi - definite programming is introduced in @xcite , which can be applied to polyploids as well .",
    "many haplotype phasing methods proposed so far considered cohorts with nominally unrelated individuals , while in @xcite a general framework for phasing of cohorts that contain some levels of relatedness is proposed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that it is feasible to reconstruct all the individual molecules if certain conditions hold . in particular",
    ", we will show that if the number and length of dna reads are above some specific thresholds , which are functions of dna sequence statistics , then reconstruction is possible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mainmodel ] , the mathematical model underlying the pooled - dna sequencing problem from dna reads is introduced .",
    "we have presented a summary of our results and main contributions in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : noiseless ] , we have derived necessary and sufficient conditions for unique and correct assembly of all molecules in the noiseless regime . in this regard , analytic upper and lower bounds on the error probability of the reliable assembly are obtained and asymptotic behaviors of the derived bounds are provided .",
    "section [ sec : noisy ] is devoted to analyze the problem of correct assembly from noisy dna reads .",
    "accordingly , we have formulated two upper bounds on the assembly error probability in the noisy regime via exploiting two novel denoising methods , i.e. maximum likelihood denoising and graph - based techniques motivated by community detection algorithms .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in collective sequencing of a population of individuals from a given specie .",
    "it is desirable to identify the genome of each individual within the population using a single run of a sequencing machine , through the so - called pooled - dna sequencing . in this section ,",
    "we first provide a formal definition of the problem in addition to statistical models employed for analytic formulations .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath1 distinct individuals where a reference genome of length @xmath2 is already sequenced and available .",
    "genetic variations among individuals and the reference genome are assumed to be originated solely from single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) .",
    "snps are a group of randomly spread nucleotides across the genome that differ in independent individuals with a high probability ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) is ignored in this study and snps are assumed to be generated independently with respect to each other and also other individuals of the species .",
    "the frequency vector usually consists of only two non - zero elements , i.e. major and minor allele frequencies .      for the purpose of library preparation , @xmath4 distinct dna fragments",
    "are extracted randomly and uniformly from each individual . in the current study",
    ", we simply assume dna reads are not tagged and hence no information regarding the membership of fragments is available .",
    "all the fragments are pooled together and fed to a sequencing machine to produce single - end reads with length @xmath5 . in section [ sec : noiseless ] , we assume sequencing machine does not produce any mismatch or indel errors while producing the reads",
    ". however , section [ sec : noisy ] assumes that dna reads are altered with an error probability of @xmath6 .",
    "recovering the genomes of all pooled individuals from the reference genome and @xmath7 reads generated by the sequencing machine is the assembly problem .",
    "we would like to determine sufficient conditions for @xmath5 and @xmath4 such that for a given set of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath6 and dna sequence statistics the assembly of genomes belonging to each of @xmath1 individuals can be carried out uniquely and correctly . in this paper , we assume that all reads are mapped uniquely and correctly to the reference genome . although this assumption is far from reality for short reads , it is quite valid for long and very long reads which are the main focus of this paper .",
    "we exploit a biologically plausible probabilistic model to mathematically formulate our problem and assumptions .",
    "the latent independent snp set of the @xmath8th individual is denoted as @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the total number of snps .",
    "also , @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the loci of snps are known and randomly spread across the reference genome according to a _",
    "process with rate @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath15 .",
    "the reason behind the _ poisson _ assumption lies in the fact that snp - causing mutations have happened uniformly and independently across the whole genome during the course of evolution .",
    "snp values are assumed to be drawn from @xmath11 multinomial distributions with frequency vector @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 indicates the frequency of base @xmath18 for the @xmath13th snp . for the sake of simplicity , different snps in a single individual , and also all snps across different individuals",
    "are assumed to be statistically independent which indicates that linkage disequilibrium and mutual ancestral properties are not taken into account .",
    "the set of pooled dna fragments are denoted by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents the @xmath8th sequenced dna read . for all @xmath21 , the read @xmath22 is assumed to be correctly aligned to the reference genome . in this regard , dna read arrivals for each individual",
    "will be known and randomly spread across the genome according to a _ poisson _",
    "process with rate @xmath23 .",
    "arrivals for different individuals are assumed to be independent from each other . regarding the dna reads",
    ", we will consider two regimes in this paper , i.e. noiseless and noisy regimes . in the former case",
    ", it has been assumed that dna reads do not contain any sequencing error ( mismatch or indel ) . in the noisy case",
    ", it has been assumed that sequencing system alters the nucleotide content of dna reads . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that sequencing error does not produce any new alleles and simply transforms a minor allele into a major one and vice versa , both with probability of @xmath6 , @xmath24 . in cases where an error event produces a new allele in a read",
    ", the allele will be randomly mapped to either minor or major alleles .",
    "the ultimate goal of this study is to investigate the conditions under which inference of the hidden snp sets for all individuals can be carried out correctly and without ambiguity .",
    "also , we present a number of procedures for multiple genome assembly in such cases . moreover , we have shown that there are conditions under which unique genome assembly is almost impossible regardless of the algorithms being employed .",
    "0.49    0.49     individuals .",
    "sequencing depth is fixed regardless of read length @xmath5 and equals @xmath25 . as can be seen ,",
    "a sharp phase transition in assembly error rate is evident as the read length is being increased.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the noiseless case , our main contribution includes necessary and sufficient conditions for unique and correct genome assembly of all individuals , in addition to respective lower and upper bounds on the assembly error probability .",
    "let us denote @xmath26 as the error event in genome assembly in the noiseless regime .",
    "then , in section [ sec : noiseless ] it is shown that when dna read density @xmath27 is above some threshold and dna read length @xmath5 is sufficiently large , the following inequalities hold : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and is an attribute of genome statistics .",
    "exact lower and upper bounds for the non - asymptotic scenario can be found in section [ sec : noiseless ] as well .    as genome length @xmath2 is increased while the number of individuals @xmath1 is fixed , the lower and upper bounds become tight and almost coincide with each other .",
    "however , for a practical configuration of parameters such as the ones given in fig .",
    "[ fig : assemblyregion ] , the theoretical gap between lower and upper bounds becomes significant . in fig .",
    "[ fig : assemblyregion ] we have demonstrated lower and upper bounds of the assembly region in @xmath5-@xmath27 plain , where the bounds correspond to assembly error rate of @xmath30 .",
    "the number of individuals is assumed to be @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : a : assemblyregion ] , and @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : b : assemblyregion ] , respectively . in this simulation , we have assumed an snp rate of @xmath33 and an effective minor allele frequency of @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 , where this numerical configuration corresponds to human dna statistics .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath36 , dna read length @xmath5 must be above some critical length in order to ensure that the assembly error rate remains sufficiently small , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "evidently , for many other species of interest such as bacteria populations , the minimum required read length is significantly smaller due to their higher snp rate @xmath14 and smaller genome length @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig : phasetransition ] shows the phase transition of the lower and upper bounds of the assembly error rate @xmath38 when sequencing depth is fixed and read length @xmath5 is increased .",
    "the upper and lower bounds correspond to the case with @xmath31 individuals , and the sequencing depth is chosen as @xmath25 which is a common value in real - world applications . to summarize , the key observation is existence of a rather sharp phase transition as @xmath5 is increased in the case of both upper and lower bounds .    in the noisy regime",
    ", we have proposed a set of sufficient conditions for unique and reliable assembly of all the genomes .",
    "in addition , two denoising algorithms are proposed for block - wise inference of true genomic contents from noisy reads , denoted by maximum - likelihood ( ml ) and spectral denoising . in this regard , the following upper bound on the error probability of reliable genome assembly via ml denoising",
    "is derived for the case of @xmath31 individuals : @xmath39 & ~\\text{subject to}~\\quad0<d < d\\leq",

    "exact non - asymptotic upper bound in the noisy case , in addition to an approximate analytical solution of the minimization problem in and also the generalization of for any @xmath41 can be found in section [ sec : noisy ] .",
    "moreover , a similar upper bound and an approximate mathematical analysis is presented for the case of spectral denoising .",
    "our proposed spectral method has a similar performance to that of ml method when @xmath6 is small , however , it is much more computationally efficient .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlasemblyregion ] , upper bounds on the assembly region in @xmath5-@xmath27 plain are shown for the assembly error rate of @xmath42 , when ml denoising is employed .",
    "results are shown for six different sequencing error rates .",
    "other configurations such as @xmath43 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 are identical to those used for fig .",
    "[ fig : assemblyregion ] which resemble the human genetic settings . as can be seen , regardless of the sequencing error rate , by increasing @xmath27",
    "the upper bounds converge to a specified dna read length which is close to that of the noiseless case ( sufficient condition for the greedy algorithm ) .",
    "[ fig : mlnoiseperf ] demonstrates the upper bounds on assembly error probability as a function of sequencing error rate for three different dna read densities .",
    "again , ml technique is employed for denoising of reads .",
    "dna read length is fixed to @xmath44kbp for all values of @xmath27 .",
    "it can be seen that upper bounds undergo a drastic phase transition as sequencing error is increased .",
    "however , larger values of @xmath27 correspond to shifting the phase transition into larger sequencing error rates . it should be noted that for both fig .",
    "[ fig : mlasemblyregion ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mlnoiseperf ] the number of individuals is assumed to be @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : assemblyregion ] for the human genetic settings .",
    "upper bounds corresponding to @xmath46 are very close to each other and also to the upper bound associated with the noiseless regime ( greedy algorithm ) . as the sequencing error",
    "is increased , assembly region is shifted toward larger values of @xmath27 and @xmath5 . moreover , when @xmath47 the upper bound for the maximum assembly error rate of @xmath45 can not be satisfied by @xmath48kbp .",
    "[ fig : sdnoiseperf ] demonstrates the upper bounds on assembly error probability via spectral denoising as a function of sequencing error rate for three different dna read lengths .",
    "dna read density is assumed to be fixed and equal to @xmath49 in all graphs . as can be seen ,",
    "similar to ml denoising , drastic phase transitions can be observed as one increases the sequencing error which can be shifted toward larger values of @xmath6 provided that @xmath5 is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "in this section , pooled - dna sequencing of @xmath1 individuals for the simple case of tagless and noiseless dna reads is studied . for any assembling strategy , one can define the error event as the event of failure in reconstructing the genomes of all individuals _ uniquely _ and _ correctly_. this error event is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "we aim to analytically compute lower and upper bounds for @xmath50 based on the statistical models given in section [ sec : model ] . to this end",
    ", we first obtain necessary and sufficient conditions of unique and correct assembly of all @xmath1 individuals . the conditions , then",
    ", are used to derive tight bounds on @xmath50 .    , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in addition to all inter - snp segments are bridged .",
    "consequently , one can uniquely and correctly assemble the two genomes . ]    in theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] , we show that two conditions are enough for necessity and sufficiency of correct assembly , namely _ coverage _ and _ bridging _ conditions .",
    "the coverage condition is met whenever every single snp in each individual is covered by at least one dna read from that individual .",
    "the bridging condition is met whenever every single _ identical region _ between each pair of individuals is bridged by at least one dna read from either of the individuals .",
    "an _ identical region _ between two particular individuals refers to any segment of genome in which they possess completely identical genomic content .",
    "if a dna read starts before an identical region and ends after it , that region is said to be bridged . fig .",
    "[ fig : bridge ] demonstrates the concept of bridging and coverage in a pooled - dna sequencing of two individuals .",
    "blue and red dna reads are associated with the first and second individuals , respectively .",
    "bold reads have bridged the three long identical regions in addition to the identical regions corresponding to inter - snp segments .",
    "the following theorem mathematically formulates the necessary and sufficient conditions for unique and correct genome assembly :    [ thm : maintheorem ] in a pooled - dna sequencing scenario with tagless and noiseless dna reads , the following conditions are necessary and sufficient for unique and correct genome assembly :    * snp coverage condition ( sc ) : every snp must be covered by at least one dna read from each individual , * bridging condition ( b ) : every identical region between any two individuals must be bridged by at least one dna read from either of the individuals .",
    "we will prove that if any of the conditions mentioned in theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] does not hold , then unique and correct assembly becomes impossible .",
    "first , assume at least one snp is not covered by any dna read for at least one individual .",
    "then , due to lack of information regarding the value of that allele for at least one individual and the final assembly is not unique .",
    "second , assume an identical region between two particular individuals is not bridged . even if it is possible to correctly assemble both sides of the unbridged identical region , absence of any bridging read inhibits the flow of membership information from one side of the region to the other . as a result ,",
    "at least two completely distinct and yet legitimate genomes can be assembled which contradicts the required uniqueness of assembly .",
    "it is desirable to design an algorithm that assembles the genomes efficiently and correctly .",
    "we will prove that a simple greedy algorithm can assemble the genomes , if the conditions provided in theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] are met . to this end",
    ", we first sort the list of reads according to their starting positions .",
    "this ordering is possible because it is assumed that reads are mapped correctly and uniquely to the reference genome .",
    "let us denote the sorted read set by @xmath53 .",
    "the proposed algorithm is detailed in algorithm [ alg : greedy ] .    *",
    "inputs *    * output *    * initialization *    * greedy merging *    we next show that the greedy algorithm assembles all the genomes correctly given the conditions in theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] are met .",
    "the proof is by induction .",
    "assume that the algorithm is correct before merging read @xmath54 , i.e. , the partially constructed genomes @xmath55 , referred to as contigs , correspond to the true genomes and all reads prior to @xmath54 are merged correctly to their corresponding contigs . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath54 is a read from the first genome .",
    "the algorithm fails if there exists @xmath56 with @xmath57 with overlap size greater than or equal to that of @xmath58 .",
    "we will show that this event does not happen if the conditions in theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] are met .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the overlap size between @xmath60 and @xmath54 for all @xmath61 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath62 for all @xmath57 .",
    "assume @xmath63 .",
    "this case corresponds to the existence of an identical region between first and @xmath64th individuals . from the third condition of the theorem , this identical region",
    "is bridged by at least one read from either individuals .",
    "the bridging read starts earlier than @xmath54 and based on our assumption is correctly merged to either @xmath58 or @xmath60 .",
    "if the read comes from the first individual , then the overlap size between @xmath60 and @xmath54 is always less that that of @xmath58 and @xmath54 which contradicts the assumption . on the other hand ,",
    "if the read comes from the @xmath64th individual , @xmath60 can not be in @xmath65 as it is not consistent with @xmath54 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "an implication of theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] is that the error event @xmath26 is the union of two events , denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are due to snp coverage and bridging conditions , respectively .",
    "consequently , one can obtain lower and upper bounds on @xmath38 as @xmath68    in the following subsections , we first analyze the probability of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we obtain the exponents of decay of each of these probabilities when one increases @xmath27 and @xmath5 .",
    "these exponents are then used to obtain asymptotic bounds on @xmath50 .      the first condition in theorem [ thm : maintheorem ]",
    "states that each snp should be contained in at least one read from each of @xmath1 individuals .",
    "equivalently , for each individual , the starting point of at least one read should fall within the distance @xmath5 of each snp . as dna fragments are randomly spread along genome with the density of @xmath23 , the distance of two consecutive fragments has an exponential distribution of the form @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the event that there exists at least on snp in the @xmath64th individual which is not covered by any read .",
    "for any @xmath64 , the probability of occurring @xmath70 conditioned on the number of reads can be exactly written as : @xmath71 where @xmath4 has a _ poisson _ distribution with average @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 this implies that if one wishes the snp coverage condition to hold for a single individual with probability @xmath74 ( for @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , then read length @xmath5 should be chosen close to : @xmath77    instead of obtaining exact formulation for the case of @xmath1 individuals , we derive tight upper and lower bounds on @xmath78 .",
    "the upper bound can be simply attained via the union bound as follows : @xmath79    for the lower bound , we have derived two asymptotically tight formulations , where one formulation is appropriate for large @xmath1 and the other is tight for large @xmath5 .",
    "when the number of individuals , @xmath1 , is not very large , one can bound @xmath78 from below simply by considering the fact that @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we have : @xmath81 this formulation is not tight when the number of individuals is very large",
    ". therefore , we offer another lower bound which linearly grows with @xmath1 .",
    "let us divide the whole genome into @xmath82 non - overlapping segments of length @xmath83 .",
    "if one individual does not have a read starting within the segment , then there exists an interval with length @xmath84 which is not covered by all individuals .",
    "moreover , if there exists one snp which arrives within this interval , then the coverage condition does not hold . in this way",
    ", @xmath78 can be lower bounded as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the total number of intervals not covered by all individuals . in addition",
    ", @xmath87 represents the probability of arriving dna reads belonging to less than @xmath1 individuals in a single segment of length @xmath83 , and can be formulated as : @xmath88 it can be shown that the optimal value of @xmath84 which maximizes the lower bound does not have a closed form analytic formulation . however , asymptotic analysis of for the case of @xmath89 results in a simpler mathematical formulation whose maximal point is analytically tractable and provides a good approximation for the optimal value of @xmath84 , denoted by @xmath90 . for large values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the lower bound can be simplified as : @xmath91 and it is easy to show that the maximizer of the above inequality can be closely approximated by @xmath92 substitution of this approximate maximizer in results in the following lower and upper bounds for @xmath78 in the asymptotic regime , where @xmath93 : @xmath94    the results for the non - asymptotic case can be easily computed by substituting @xmath90 into , since any value of @xmath84 implies a lower bound . from the asymptotic analysis it is evident that both lower and upper bounds have the same exponent of decay with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the duality in the formulation of lower bound yields that for small values of @xmath1 , the error probability of snp coverage in a single individual is an acceptable approximation for @xmath78 . on the other hand , when @xmath1 is large , the alternate lower bound is more favorable .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath95 , the transition between the two lower bounds occur when @xmath96 .",
    "in this subsection , we first obtain lower and upper bounds on @xmath97 for the case of two individuals ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "interestingly , it is shown that exponents of decay of both lower and upper bounds are the same with respect to read length @xmath5 and read density @xmath27 .",
    "we also provide an exact analysis of the error probability in appendix [ app : exactbridging ] which can be used for numerical analyses . generalization to more than two individuals is carried out at the end of this subsection .",
    "let us denote a snp which has different alleles in the two individuals as a discriminating snp .",
    "identical regions between the two genomes correspond to segments between any two consecutive discriminating snps .",
    "the bridging condition for the two individual case implies that all of these identical regions must be bridged by at least one read from one of the two individuals . in the following ,",
    "we first show that under the assumptions of section [ sec : model ] the arrival of discriminating snps corresponds to a",
    "_ poisson _ process .",
    "we subsequently derive lower and upper bounds on @xmath98 based on this property .    per definition ,",
    "the difference between genomes of two particular individuals is solely due to discriminating snps .",

    "process with rate @xmath115 .",
    "we first focus on the error probability of bridging a single identical region .",
    "this event is denoted @xmath116 .",

    "let @xmath124 represent the event that there are less than two discriminating snps in the whole genome .",

    ", the new current read again falls into one of the conditions described so far .",
    "this procedure continues until bridging condition fails or is satisfied . in the following , we model the above - mentioned procedure via a pair of markovian random processes , facilitating the mathematical formulation of @xmath145 .",
    "let us assume at least two discriminating snps exist in genome . also , at least one dna read exists that includes the first discriminating snp .",
    "we denote the last read containing this snp as the current read .",
    "let us define two coupled and finite markovian random processes @xmath314 and @xmath315 , @xmath316 as follows .",
    "let @xmath315 be the distance of last discriminating snp in the current read from the read s end position .",
    "in order to define @xmath317 , we consider the last dna read starting strictly after the current read which includes the last discriminating snp in the current read . then , @xmath314 represents the distance of this read from the current read s starting position .",
    "based on these definitions , the probability of failure @xmath318 is defined as the probability that one can not find a pair @xmath319 , given that @xmath320 exists . therefore : @xmath321 the processes @xmath315 and @xmath314 terminate at step @xmath104 with probability @xmath322 , otherwise they continue to the next step . at each step , @xmath315 and @xmath314",

    "therefore , the probability of error in bridging all identical regions can be formulated as : @xmath324 where @xmath129 indicates the distance between the first and the last discriminating snps .",
    "although the relation in does not give an explicit mathematical formulation for @xmath145 , it provides a rigorous numerical procedure to approximate the error probability of the bridging condition with an arbitrary high precision .",
    "moreover , upper and lower bounds obtained in section [ sec : noiseless ] can be reattained by bounding the formulation in .",

    "we will show that when @xmath338 and @xmath235 , then there exists @xmath209 such that @xmath339 .",
    "the proof is by contradiction .",
    "assume two sets @xmath234 that result in the same statistical distribution over all sequences in @xmath207 .",

    "each equation in is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath192 , and therefore has at most @xmath192 roots .",
    "acceptable roots must be real and fall in the interval @xmath349",
    ". moreover , the roots must be common among all @xmath350 equations .",
    "consequently , one can deduce that the constraints hold only when all the coefficients of the polynomial become zero .",
    "for any @xmath209 , if @xmath351 then one of the _ hamming _ distances @xmath212 becomes zero and one @xmath352 term appears in the @xmath156th equation . since the equation holds globally , i.e. for all @xmath348 , then a term @xmath353 must also appear in the summation .",
    "this implies that for one @xmath354 , @xmath343 is zero implying @xmath355 .",
