    "presented below is the necessary prerequisite knowledge ; this includes general statistics ( section [ sec : hy ] ) , such as hypothesis testing and the likelihood ratio ( section [ sec : lifu ] ) , as well as an explanation of how these techniques are used in particle physics ( section [ sec : paphst ] ) .",
    "we then explain the mathematical basis for the asimov data set based upon results from wilks and wald ( section [ sec : asap ] ) , as given by the authors of @xcite .",

    "a hypothesis is a suggested solution to explain a given phenomenom .",
    "one often compares the validity of two hypotheses through statistical testing , where one decides whether a given null hypothesis , @xmath0 , should be rejected in favor of the alternate hypotheses , @xmath1 . in particle physics",
    "the null hypothesis typically contains all known processes and the alternate hypothesis may also contain a new process or particle .",
    "meaning , the null hypothesis would be background - only and the alternate hypothesis would then be signal - plus - background .",
    "a test statistic is a function of the sample and assumed to be a numerical summary of the data that can be used to reject , or fail to reject , a hypothesis .",
    "this can be done by calculating the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the one observed , which is called a @xmath2-value .",
    "this represents the level of agreement between the data and a single hypothesis .",
    "the @xmath2-value can be measured against a significance level @xmath3 , defined as the critical @xmath2-value ; i.e. @xmath2 must be less than or equal to @xmath3 to reject a given hypothesis .",
    "the @xmath2-value can also be converted to a standardized value , such as a @xmath4-score , the number of standard deviations a datum is from the mean ; @xmath4 is given as a function of @xmath2 by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , the quantile of the standard gaussian + where @xmath7 . at @xmath8 , a commonly used signficance level , the @xmath4-score is equal to 1.64 for a one - sided test ; a one - sided test is used when the critical outcomes capable of rejecting a hypothesis occur on only one side of the distribution .",
    "because we can distinguish between positive and negative fluctuations in our tests we use a one - sided test , with a 95% confidence level ( cl ) exclusion .",
    "the likelihood of a given observation given a set of parameters is equal to the probability of a set of parameter values given an observation .",
    "consider a set of n observables , contained in @xmath9 , described by probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the unknown parameters , which also known as the nuisance parameters .",
    "assuming statistical independence between the measurements @xmath12 , then the likelihood function l ( ) is    @xmath13    the @xmath14 values that maximize this function are denoted @xmath15 . in order to find the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimators one can solve the formula @xcite    @xmath16    the covariance matrix of the ml estimators , @xmath17 $ ] can be used to estimate the standard deviation , @xmath18 .",
    "we can find this by first finding the inverse covariance matrix , which can be approximated as    @xmath19    and then invert the resulting matrix to find the standard deviation .",

    "the purpose of the control sample is to add useful constraints to the nuisance parameters .    using the signal - plus - background and background - only information ,",

    "this is due to the systematic uncertainty being non - gaussian .",
    "both sets were run from 0% to 50% on the uncertainty that varies , but are only plotted up to 35% .",

    "other than this , at low uncertainty differences the aww approximation is still valid , however above 35% on the varying systematic uncertainty it is invalid as the model breaks down .",
    "next , we tested the resilience of the aww approximation against deviations in the tau of the exponential decay function of the background .",
    "the initial @xmath83 value we used , 0.203 , was chosen in order to simulate the least likelihood ratio values found in a set of real tevatron data ( this is also true for the case of the signal tau formula , where @xmath84 ) .",

    "this is evident on the ratio plot , where there is an asymptotic behavior as the number of events increases .",
    "this was applied with a 5% background - only rate systematic uncertainty , so the limit approaches about 0.95 .",
    "in summary , we tested the aww approximation against the full semi - frequentist calculation , with no approximations , as calculated in collie .",
    "we ran background - only rate systematic uncertainties , background - only and signal shape systematic uncertainties , asymmetric gaussian flat systematic uncertainties , varied the background shape itself , varied the number of bins , and varied the number of events .",
    "the aww approximation behaved as expected based on the results from @xcite .",
    "the tests where the model correctly reproduces the parameter values of the full calculation include the rate systematic uncertainties , the background and signal shape uncertainties , the number of histograms bins , and the uncertainty in the background shape .",
    "the shape systematic uncertainties on only background , and the combined shape and background systematic uncertainties run at about 95% of the true value , i.e. the aww approximation would exclude with 95% the signal strength required of the full calculation . when there are no systematic uncertainties the two methods returned nearly equal values .",
    "none of the figures for these tests show any absolute trend .",
    "the tests where the aww model breaks down occur where expected .",
    "the first of these are the asymmetric gaussian tests . in the case where the asymmetry is small , roughly at or below 25% difference ( a=2/3 ) , the aww approximation and collie agree .",
    "but when the difference is greater the aww approximation fails .",
    "the second test where the model fails to reproduce the full calculation value is where the number of data points is varied . at low numbers the model fails to reproduce the full calculation , but as the number increases it approches an asymptotic value close to that of the full calculation .",
    "these results are as expected given the two approximations , wilks and wald , combined to form the new approximation , the asimov data set , and is consistent with the report this paper examines .",
    "one of the conditions for wilks theorem is using a sufficiently large sample and one of the conditions for wald s theorem is that the data uncertainties follow a gaussian distribution ( there are more conditions necessary to use either theorem , but these are the two that explain the behavior found in tests where the aww approximation fails ) . in the case where an asymmetric gaussian becomes non",
    "- gaussian the model fails , as expected according to wald s theorem and as the number of data points falls , the mentioned condition for wilks s theorem fails ( as well as increasing the neglected term in the wald formula ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that when the conditional definitions of wilks and wald are met , then the approximation presented in _ asymptotic formulae for likelihood - based tests of new physics _ does reproduce the full calculation reliably within 5 - 10% .",
    "our results suggest that the approximations , published by cowan , cranmer , gross , and vitells , has the correct asymptotic behavior as designed .",
