    "it has long been known that many galaxies have warped disks .",
    "the phenomenon occurs at large galactocentric radii , starting close to the edge of the optical disk .",
    "this makes 21-cm line observations essential for the study of warps : there are galaxies that have no optical warp and yet exhibit extraordinary warps in their outer hi layers .    the first indication that the hi distribution of disk galaxies was sometimes bent or warped came in 1957 from observations of our own galaxy ( burke , 1957 ; kerr , 1957 ) .",
    "early calculations showed that the tidal field due to the magellanic clouds was unable to account for the warp of the galaxy ( burke , 1957 ; kerr , 1957 ; hunter & toomre , 1969 ) , and so it was regarded as a rare , uncommon phenomenon . later on , sancisi ( 1976 ) studied the hi layer of 5 edge - on galaxies and discovered 4 of them to have warps .",
    "this result indicated that warps are very common among galaxies .",
    "this discovery was not expected , because three of sancisi s galaxies were quite isolated and thus presented a problem with the tidal - warp scenario .",
    "the high incidence of warps among spiral galaxies has later been confirmed with larger samples both in the optical @xcite and the hi @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of warps means that either warps are long - lasting phenomena or they are transient but easily and often excited .",
    "neither of these has been proven and no satisfactory explanation has been found yet .",
    "a study by briggs ( 1990 ) of a sample of 12 galaxies showed that : ( 1 ) warps start around r@xmath0 - r@xmath1 ; ( 2 ) the line of nodes of the warp is straight inside r@xmath0 , and is a leading spiral outside .",
    "the absence of a mechanism that would regularly generate warps and the fact that the line of nodes of the observed warps does not show a severe winding effect @xcite suggest that warps are long - lived .",
    "the main issue in trying to explain a long lasting warp is differential precession , which in a few rotation periods will destroy the coherent warp pattern ( this is similar to the winding problem of material spiral arms ) .",
    "the differential precession arises from the non - sphericity of the potential @xcite .",
    "however , the survival time of a coherent warp pattern can be larger if the halo in which the disk is embedded deviates only slightly from spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "likewise , a halo with a flattening that decreases outwards in the right way would be able to maintain a coherent warped disk for a hubble time @xcite .    extending the work of hunter & toomre ( 1969 ) , sparke & casertano ( 1988 ) studied long - lived warping modes of a galactic disk inside an oblate halo potential , where no winding occurs .",
    "they found that the combined torque from a halo and a self - gravitating disk allows a configuration in which the precession frequency of the warp is the same at all radii , thus allowing the warp to maintain its shape unchanged for many rotation periods .",
    "one of their assumptions was that of a fixed halo potential that does not react to the potential of the disk .",
    "the back - reaction of the precessing disk onto the halo , analogous to dynamical friction , was investigated by dubinski & kuijken ( 1995 ) , nelson & tremaine ( 1995 ) , and binney et al .",
    "( 1998 ) after an earlier investigation in terms of wkb density waves by bertin and mark ( 1980 ) .",
    "it turns out that it has a very strong influence on the evolution of the warp , causing the disk and halo to reorient to a common plane of symmetry in a few orbital times , and making the warp decay .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,^,>,^,^ , > , > \" , ]",
    "in this appendix we explain how we have determined the warp radius for our galaxies using gaussian fits perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "we take both the centroids of the gaussian fits ( we refer to them as datapoints ) and their uncertainties ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the basic idea is to determine the radius at which the galactic disk begins to bend away from the plane defined by the inner disk in a systematic way .",
    "we take the innermost r@xmath0/2 part of the disk as the inner disk , which we assume is flat .",
    "we fit a straight line to it and determine the vertical offset and the dispersion ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the offset will correct ( to first order ) possible errors in the determination of the center of the galaxy , and we can use the dispersion as an estimate of how noisy our disk is ( influence of not completely edge - on spiral arms and other irregularities ) .",
    "we then define the warp radius as the location where a significantly large portion of the disk ( at least r@xmath0/4 ) departs coherently more than @xmath4 from the plane defined by the inner disk .",
    "@xmath2 are the uncertainties of the individual datapoints in the warped portion of the disk .    if the uncertainties in the datapoints are large we could miss some warps with this procedure . even with large errors",
    ", a coherent smooth warp could be detected if we smooth the warp curve and apply the procedure again .",
    "thus we smooth the warp curve to different resolutions and determine a preliminary warp radius at each resolution .",
    "the final warp radius is the minimum value of all the preliminary values .",
    "the outcome of this method is shown in the atlas in fig .",
