    "layered nitride @xmath0-@xmath3ncl@xcite ( @xmath4hf , zr ) doped with carriers is one of the most interesting group of superconductors .",
    "the mother compound @xmath0-@xmath3ncl is composed of alternate stacking of honeycomb ( hc ) @xmath3n bilayer and cl bilayer.@xcite this is a band insulator and becomes a superconductor upon doping electrons by na or li intercalation .",
    "they exhibit relatively high @xmath2 up to @xmath5k for @xmath4hf and @xmath6k for @xmath4zr .",
    "the bilayer hc lattice structure consisting of @xmath3 and n is considered to be playing the main role in the occurrence of superconductivity , and the two dimensional nature of the superconductivity has been revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite and muon spin relaxation ( @xmath7sr ) studies.@xcite    despite the relatively high @xmath2 , experimental as well as theoretical studies indicate extremely low density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level.@xcite in fact , they have the highest @xmath2 among materials with the specific heat coefficient @xmath8 as small as @xmath9 1mj / molk@xmath10 .",
    "the electron phonon coupling is also estimated to be weak,@xcite and the isotope effect is found to be small.@xcite these experiments suggest that some kind of unconventional pairing mechanism may be at work , but on the other hand , nmr knight shift measurement suggests spin singlet pairing,@xcite and the tunneling spectroscopy@xcite and specific heat@xcite experiments find a fully open , seemingly @xmath11-wave like gap .",
    "however , regarding this fully open gap , recent experiments show that the anisotropy of the gap increases with doping .",
    "namely , when the doping concentration is small , the specific heat coefficient increases linearly as a function of the magnetic field , suggesting an isotropic gap,@xcite while a steep increase of the coefficient at low magnetic field is observed for higher doping.@xcite also , @xmath12 determined from the specific heat measurement ranges from @xmath13 in the lightly doped regime to less than @xmath14 in the heavily doped regime,@xcite which may be an indication that the maximum and minimum values of the gap have a substantial difference when heavily doped , and the specific heat is mainly governed by the minimum value .",
    "moreover , a recent superfluid density measurement by @xmath7sr shows that the gap is nearly isotropic when the doping concentration is small , while the anisotropy increases for large doping.@xcite very recently , absence of coherence peak in the spin lattice relaxation rate has been found in an nmr experiment,@xcite again suggesting unconventional pairing , most probably with some kind of sign change in the superconducting gap .",
    "furthermore , for li@xmath15hfncl , an intercalation of organic molecules tetrahydrofuran ( thf ) between the layers is found to enhance @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite    given these experimental circumstances , here we study two types of models for the doped @xmath0-mncl , a two band model on a hc lattice , and a single band model where the nitrogen site is effectively integrated out . while the latter model does not seem to suffice for explaining the relatively high @xmath2 in this series of material , the former one provides a possibility of spin fluctuation mediated @xmath16-wave superconductivity in the doped @xmath0-mncl.@xcite spin fluctuation mediated pairing in a doped _ band insulator _ may sound surprising and odd at first sight since one can not expect strong spin fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the relatively high @xmath2 despite the low dos and the temperature independent spin susceptibility is a characteristic feature of the spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity of a doped band insulator on the hc lattice .",
    "the most probable pairing state below @xmath2 is the @xmath1 state , whose gap anisotropy on the fermi surface is found to be strongly enhanced upon increasing the carrier concentration .",
    "we also study the effect of the three dimensionality , where the inter layer hopping suppresses superconductivity .",
    "we first obtain the effective model for @xmath0-mncl .",
    "although the material consists of bilayer hc lattice , here we consider models on a single layer lattice , and try to reproduce the bands that lie close to the fermi level in the first principles band calculations .",
    "the simplest one is a single band model on a triangular lattice , in which the nitrogen site degrees of freedom is effectively integrated out , so that there is only one site per unit cell .",
    "this is a model that corresponds to the single band hubbard model for the cuprates , where the oxygen @xmath17 , @xmath18 degrees of freedom is integrated out from the original three band @xmath16-@xmath19 model . by considering hopping integrals up to fourth nearest neighbors ( fig.[fig1 ] , upper panel )",
    ", we can reproduce the single band that crosses the fermi level in the first principles band calculations.@xcite the band dispersion of the single band model with @xmath20 ( ev ) , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is shown by the green dash - dotted line in fig.[fig1 ] .",

    "n  orbitals with a level offset , which roughly reproduces the conduction and valence bands closest to the fermi level , as shown by the dashed lines in the middle panel of fig.[fig1 ] . here",
    "we take the nearest neighbor ( m - n ) hopping @xmath24ev , the level offset @xmath25 , and the next nearest neighbor ( m - m ) hopping @xmath26 .    the on - site interaction @xmath27 is considered in the single band model , and the on - site interaction @xmath27 is introduced on both m and n orbitals in the two orbital model@xcite .",
    "the band filling @xmath28 is defined as the number of electrons / number of sites . for the single band model , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the li or na content ,",
    "since there are two m sites per unit cell , which results in bonding and antibonding bands , and the electrons are doped only in the bonding band .",
    "for the two band model , @xmath31 corresponds to the non - doped case , and @xmath30 and @xmath28 is related by @xmath32 .",

    "we have also tried a model that considers the nearest neighbor off - site interaction @xmath36 in addition to @xmath49 . in this case ,",
    "strong charge fluctuations arise , which makes the triplet vs. singlet competition more subtle , but in any case , the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation remained small even when the magnitude of @xmath36 is close to the point where the charge susceptibility diverges . considering the experimental fact that the @xmath2 is relatively high in the doped @xmath0-mncl , and also that the pairing occurs in the spin singlet channel@xcite , we believe that the single band model does not suffice as an effective model for @xmath0-mncl .",

    "the dashed arrows represent the wave vectors at which the spin fluctuations develop.,width=302 ]    the high @xmath2 obtained in this model can be understood as a combination of several features of this model .",
    "let us start with a canonical hc lattice , where @xmath57 and @xmath62 .",
    "we show in fig.[fig5](a ) the flex result of the maximum value of the spin susceptibility as a function of temperature for the band filling of @xmath55 .",
    "the spin susceptibility is nearly independent of @xmath63,@xcite which is in sharp contrast with the hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "for example , for the square lattice with @xmath53 , we have a strong enhancement of the spin susceptibility upon lowering the temperature .",
    "with further hole doping to @xmath54 , the spin susceptibility is suppressed , but even there , the spin susceptibility moderately increases upon lowering the temperature .",
    "also in fig.[fig5](a ) , we show the eigenvalue @xmath44 of the linearized eliashberg equation as functions of temperature for the hc and square lattices .",
    "@xmath2 is the temperature where @xmath44 reaches unity .",
    "the dos at @xmath64 is nearly the same for the square lattice with @xmath54 and the hc lattice with @xmath55 , and also the spin susceptibility has similar values at low temperature , but still , the hc lattice has higher @xmath2.@xcite",
    "so what is the origin of this high @xmath2 ?",
    "fig.[fig6](a ) shows the contour plot of the green s function squared , whose ridge corresponds to the fermi surface , which consists of disconnected 2d pockets centered around k and k points .",
    "the spin susceptibility in fig.[fig6](b ) is maximized at wave vectors that bridge the opposite sides of each pieces of the fermi surface . as can be seen in fig.[fig6](c ) ( and more clearly in ( d ) ) the gap has a @xmath16-wave form , where the gap changes sign across the wave vector at which the spin susceptibility is maximized .",
    "in contrast to the case of the square lattice , one of the nodes of the @xmath16-wave gap does not intersect the fermi surface because of its disconnectivity , i.e. , the gap is like `` @xmath19-wave '' if we focus only on one of the fermi surfaces .",
    "since smaller number of gap nodes on the fermi surface is favorable for superconductivity,@xcite this can be a reason for high @xmath2 despite the low dos and the weak spin fluctuations .",
    "we now introduce the m - n level offset @xmath59 as in the model for @xmath0-mncl . as shown in fig.[fig5](b ) , we find that superconductivity is relatively robust against the introduction of @xmath59 .",
    "this again is in sharp contrast with the square lattice , where finite @xmath59 strongly suppresses superconductivity .",
    "the weak effect of @xmath59 may be because the dos of the hc lattice is small near the band center , so that the introduction of @xmath59 , which opens up a gap at the center of the band , is less effective than in the case of the square lattice , where the dos diverges at the band center for @xmath62 .",
    "let us now comment on the origin of the difference between the single and two band models , namely , low @xmath2 triplet pairing in the former model and the high @xmath2 singlet pairing in the latter .",
    "the difference mainly comes from the difference in the band filling , i.e. , for the single band model , the band filling is dilute , favoring ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , while in the two band model , it is near half filling in favor of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "of course , if the level offset @xmath59 is large enough , the two band case should tend to the single band case , as have been shown in ref.@xcite , but in the present case , the magnitude of @xmath59 is small enough to retain the nature of the @xmath62 situation .      apart from the @xmath2 , another important issue is the form of the superconducting gap . by symmetry , there are two degenerate @xmath16-wave gaps , and the most probable form of the gap below @xmath2 is the form @xmath1 , where the two @xmath16-wave gaps mix with a phase shift of @xmath65.@xcite since the two @xmath16-wave gaps have nodal lines at different positions , this kind of mixture leads to a gap that has a finite absolute value on the entire fermi surface .",
    "the @xmath1 form of the gap can be constructed from the @xmath16-wave gap obtained by solving the linearized eliashberg equation . in the upper panels of fig.[fig7 ] , we show the contour plot of the @xmath1 gap for the case of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the model for @xmath0-mncl .",
    "( color online ) upper two panels : the contour plots of the @xmath1 gap for @xmath66 ( top ) and @xmath67 ( middle ) . the model for @xmath0-mncl",
    "is used . the yellow ( light ) solid line ( closed around the brillouin zone edge )",
    "represents the fermi surface .",
    "lower panel : the normalized @xmath1 gap along the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath68 is defined in the top panel .",
    ", width=245 ]    to clearly see the anisotropy on the fermi surface , we plot the magnitude of the gap ( normalized by the maximum value ) in the lower panel of fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath1 gap is nearly isotropic for low doping concentration , while it becomes more and more anisotropic for higher doping .",
    "the @xmath1 pairing scenario is consistent with the experimental findings that the superconductivity occurs in the spin singlet@xcite , @xmath11-wave like channel,@xcite while the coherence peak in the spin lattice relaxation rate is absent.@xcite it is also consistent with the experimental finding that the gap anisotropy increases upon doping.@xcite since the @xmath1 state breaks time reversal symmetry , it is interesting to experimentally investigate such a possibility .      finally , we consider the effect of dimensionality by adopting a three dimensional model where the two band model on the hc lattice is connected by vertical ( m - m and",
    "n - n ) hopping integrals @xmath69 ( inset of fig.[fig8 ] ) . here , we take up to @xmath70 @xmath42-point meshes and up to 8192 matsubara frequencies . in fig.[fig8 ] , we plot @xmath2 as a function of @xmath69 for the band filling of @xmath55 .",
    "as can be seen , the three dimensionality suppresses @xmath2 , which is in agreement at least qualitatively with the experimental finding that the intercalation of thf molecules between the layers enhances @xmath2.@xcite    in fact , the suppression of @xmath2 with increasing three dimensionality is a general trend for spin fluctuation mediated pairing as has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , since the pairing interaction is large around a certain wave vector in spin fluctuation mediated pairing , the fraction of the volume where the pairing interaction is large in the brillouin zone becomes smaller as the three dimensionality increases .",
    "@xmath2 plotted as a function of @xmath69 for the model shown in the inset .",
    "@xmath24ev , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 , @xmath55.,width=302 ]",
    "in the present study , we have studied two kinds of model for the the doped @xmath0-mncl .",
    "we have found that the single band model does not suffice as a minimal effective model of the material . on the other hand , from the study on the two band model",
    ", we have proposed a possibility of spin fluctuation mediated @xmath1-wave superconductivity in the doped @xmath0-mncl .",
    "we have shown that the relatively high @xmath2 is obtained as a characteristic feature of the spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity in a doped band insulator on the hc lattice .",
    "we have also found that the gap anisotropy on the fermi surface strongly increases upon increasing the doping concentration , and the inter layer hopping suppresses superconductivity .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "one remaining issue is the curious doping dependence of the superconductivity . for li@xmath15zrncl",
    ", @xmath2 shows an increase upon lowering the carrier concentration until a sudden disappearance of the @xmath2 and a superconductor - insulator transition is observed.@xcite recently , this increase of @xmath2 has been shown to be correlated with the increase of the uniform spin susceptibility , which can be considered as a support for the present spin fluctuation scenario.@xcite in fact , although the spin fluctuation is nearly _ temperature _ independent in our model ( so that the development of the spin fluctuation upon lowering the temperature need not be observed experimentally ) , it is strongly _ doping _ dependent and is enhanced upon lowering the doping rate.@xcite nonetheless , the origin of the _ sudden _ drop of @xmath2 at a certain doping rate can not be explained within the present two band model ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) and remains as an open problem . also , the almost constant behavior of @xmath2 in the heavily doped regime@xcite is puzzling since for such a large doping , the fermi level hits the second band and a large difference in the dos should be detected ( which is not the case experimentally )",
