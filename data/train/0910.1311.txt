    "the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem has recently been given renewed attention due to new theoretical results which then prompted new experimental and computational techniques .",
    "the new theoretical results concern the conditions under which such experiments are feasible at all @xcite , including a possible way to formulate the ks theorem for single qubits @xcite . such results and experiments enable applications in quantum computation ( restrictions imposed on complex configurations of quantum gates , implementations of ks configurations of quantum gates that rule out classical solutions , etc . ) .",
    "the experiments were carried out for spin@xmath0 particles ( correlated photons or spatial and spin neutron degrees of freedom ) , and therefore in this paper we provide results only for 4-dim ks vector sets of yes - no questions ( ks sets for short ) .",
    "the first experiments and their designs @xcite were not literal ks sets .",
    "they made use of state - dependent vector orientations that were additionally `` translated '' into new measurable observables according to ingenious keys found by their authors , because they could not be directly implemented by reading off the orientations of the vectors from the original set .",
    "the most recent designs and experiments @xcite dispense with state - dependent vectors .",
    "the configurations of hilbert space vectors and subspaces in ks sets have interesting symmetries that have intrigued many authors since the very discovery of the ks theorem .",
    "the set of kochen and specker themselves @xcite is a highly symmetrical structure that consists of three identical substructures each of which consists of five hexagons .",
    "this perfect symmetry enabled kochen and specker to `` see '' and prove their theorem .",
    "other highly symmetrical 3-dimensional constructions were given by peres @xcite and penrose @xcite .",
    "both constructions can be given a straightforward physical interpretation ( by means of either rays in a 3-dim spin-1 hilbert space ",
    "equivalent to those in euclidean space  or by means of majorana spin representation ) and an appealing geometrical visualisation on a cube @xcite or on escher s waterfall ornament @xcite .",
    "similar symmetries were found for higher spins , i.e. , higher dimensions . in four dimensions , even more",
    "symmetries have been found .",
    "peres has found a highly symmetrical @xmath1 system of 24 vectors grouped in 24 tetrads each consisting of 4 mutually orthogonal vectors.@xcite this system can be seen as a geometrical representation of mermin s elegant set for a pair of two spin-@xmath2 subsystems ( @xmath3 ) @xcite which has recently been experimentally realised @xcite .",
    "another representation , based on a dodecahedron ( consisting of 12 pentagons and containing 40 rays ) , has been given by penrose.@xcite its physical representation is based on a majorana representation of a pair of entangled spin-@xmath4 systems . in these examples ,",
    "a geometric visualisation is not as direct as in the aforementioned 3-dim cases , where we can make use of a euclidean space instead of a hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless it can help us find appropriate experimental sets even in cases with a much higher number of rays , corresponding to the number of measurements and preparations of a system or the number of gates we pass the system through  depending on the kind of experiment .    for instance , ks sets recently considered by aravind and lee - elkin are based on the geometry of two 4-dimensional polytopes , the 600-cell ( each cell congruent to a regular tetrahedron ) and the 120-cell , which provide us with highly symmetrical configurations of 60 and 300 ks rays , respectively .",
    "@xcite these highly symmetrical structures ( usually a particular regular group ) can be extended to higher dimensions @xcite , but they also contain many ks substructures .",
    "for example , the smallest 4-dim 18 - 9 system found by cabello , estebaranz , and garca - alcaine @xcite , a 20 - 11 found by @xcite , and a number of systems with 19 through 24 rays and 10 through 24 tetrads found by pavii , merlet , mckay , and megill @xcite were all found to be contained in peres 24 - 24 system @xcite .",
    "these findings motivated us to find out how many possible ks sets there are , how many of them are sub - sets of larger ones , and whether we can generate them from each other .",
    "this is , however , a rather complex task which can not be carried out as a straightforward counting , simply because all today s clusters and grids together would take many ages of the universe to carry it out using a brute force approach .",
    "the complexity of the direct approach is illustrated , e.g. , by the fact that it took seven years before gould and aravind @xcite succeeded in comparing just two of such systems  the aforementioned peres and penrose s 3-dim ks systems  and proving them isomorphic to each other .",
    "instead , we developed a new way of describing and visualising ks systems , wrote many new algorithms and programs , and discovered many new symmetries and other features of the systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we gave algorithms for exhaustive generation of ks system containing arbitrary number of vectors with all possible numbers of their blocks in any number of dimensions with vector component values from any set .",
    "then we scanned all the systems with up to ( but not included ) 23 vectors in a 4-dim space . in the meantime",
    ", we also scanned all the systems with 23 vectors , and the results revealed many new features .",
    "in particular , it turned out that all possible ks vector sets with up to and including 23 vectors and with components from the set \\{-1,0,1 } are contained in peres 24 - 24 set .",
    "it was obvious that by simply pealing off blocks of vectors from the 24 - 24 set we get many more subsets .",
    "but then we discovered that by using a lattice representation of vector rays and filtering them through dispersive states that we can define on these lattices , we get exactly the ks subsets contained in the 24 - 24 set . via this method , we get additional 844 24-vector systems contained in the 24 - 24 set . we conjecture that these are all possible ks sets with 24 vectors with components from the set \\{-1,0,1}.    we also found 37 new ks sets with 22 through 24 vectors with component values from other sets ( not from \\{-1,0,1 } ) .",
    "to obtain our results we used the algorithms that are described in detail in @xcite and some others that we describe in the appendix a.    we start by describing vectors as vertices ( points ) and orthogonalities between them as edges ( lines connecting vertices ) , thus obtaining mmp diagrams @xcite which are defined as follows :    * every vertex belongs to at least one edge ; * every edge contains at least 3 vertices ; * edges that intersect each other in @xmath5 vertices contain at least @xmath6 vertices ;    we denote vertices of mmp diagrams by 1,2, .. ,a , b, .. a , b , ... there is no upper limit for the number of vertices and/or edges in our algorithms and/or programs .",
    "isomorphism - free generation of mmp diagrams follows the general principles established by  @xcite , which we now recount briefly .",
    "deleting an edge from an mmp diagram , together with any vertices that lie only on that edge , yields another mmp diagram ( perhaps the vacuous one with no vertices ) .",
    "consequently , every mmp diagram can be constructed by starting with the vacuous diagram and adding one edge at a time , at each stage obtaining a new mmp diagram .",
    "we can represent this process as a rooted tree whose vertices correspond to mmp diagrams , in which the vertices and edges have unique labels .",
    "the vacuous diagram is at the root of the tree , and for any other diagram its parent node is the diagram formed by deleting the edge with the highest label .",
    "the isomorph rejection problem is to prune this tree until it contains just one representative of each isomorphism class of diagram .",
    "to find diagrams that can not be ascribed 0 - 1 values , we apply an algorithm which we call states01 and which is based on the lattice theory of hilbert space states .",
    "the algorithm is an exhaustive search of mmp diagrams with backtracking .",
    "the criterion for assigning 0 - 1 ( dispersion - free ) states is that each edge must contain exactly one vertex assigned to 1 , with the others assigned to 0 .",
    "as soon as a vertex on an edge is assigned a 1 , all other vertices on that edge become constrained to 0 , and so on .",
    "to find ks vectors , we follow the idea put forward in @xcite and proceed so as to require that their number , i.e.  the number of vertices within edges , corresponds to the dimension of the experimental space @xmath7 and that edges correspond to @xmath8 equations resulting from inner products of vectors being equal to zero ( meaning orthogonality ) .",
    "so , e.g. , an edge of length 4 , bcde , represents the following 6 equations : @xmath9    each possible combination of edges for a chosen number of vertices corresponds to a system of such nonlinear equations .",
    "a solution to systems which correspond to mmp diagrams without 0 - 1 states is a set of components of ks vectors we want to find .",
    "thus the main method for finding _ all _ ks vectors is to exhaustively generate all mmp diagrams , then pick out all those diagrams that can not have 0 - 1 states , then establish the correspondence between the latter diagrams and the equations for the vectors as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmp - eq ] ) , and finally solve the systems of the so obtained equations .    to find solutions in the set \\{-1,0,1 } we use the program vectorfind , and to find solutions in the set of real numbers we use the interval analysis as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "there is no other upper limit for the number of vertices and edges of the generated mmp diagrams and solved equations apart from the computational power of today s supercomputers .    in table",
    "[ t : tablea ] we give the numbers of all 18-  through 24-vector sets with component values from \\{-1,0,1 } that we generated and solved with the help of the aforementioned algorithms and programs .",
    "vector sets with vector component values from other sets then \\{-1,0,1 } are given at the and of the paper .",
    "= cmss8    we reported on the properties of the ks sets with 18 through ( including ) 22 vectors in @xcite .",
    "it took two weeks on our cluster with 500 3.4 ghz processors ( recalculated ) in 2004 .",
    "for the present results , we ran a parallel computation for 23-vector sets and obtained the 275 sets given in the 6th row of table [ t : tablea ] .",
    "this took about two months on our cluster .",
    "we then analysed the data and conjectured that all sets with solutions from \\{-1,0,1 } might be subsets of the aforementioned 24 - 24 set .",
    "our program subgraph confirmed the conjecture .",
    "that meant that we can actually get all 18- through 24-vector sets by stripping vectors and tetrads  vertices and edges in mmp notation  of the 24 - 24 set and filtering it with our state01 program described in @xcite .",
    "we wrote the program subset to generate all subsets ( i.e. mmp diagrams with edges removed ) of the 24 - 24 set . from these",
    ", we determined the ones with 18 through 23 vectors that are isomorphic with the ones we previously obtained on our cluster .",
    "it is interesting that all such stripped sets filtered by state01 have solutions .",
    "in addition , we determined ( again filtering the output of subset ) 844 24-vector sets with 12 through 23 tetrads ( mmp diagrams with 24 vertices with 12 through 23 edges ) .",
    "they are given in the seventh row of table [ t : tablea ] .",
    "all that , i.e. , obtaining all 1232 sets shown in table [ t : tablea ] with their vector component values from the 24 - 24-set , took a few minutes on a single pc .    in that way we can even get new sets with up to 41 vectors ( upper limit for the solutions from \\{-1,0,1 } @xcite ) simply by adding new vectors and tetrads to the sets from the 7th row of table [ t : tablea ]    for a higher number of vertices we might find ks sets that do not contain any of the sets from table [ t : tablea ] as their subsets . if their vectors had their component values from the set \\{-1,0,1 }",
    ", they should have loops of order higher than six because they should not have any of the above 1,231 sets as their subsets . with today",
    "s computer power , such a search is not feasible , though .",
    "we analysed the obtained vector sets and obtained the properties we present below .",
    "all the vector sets contain a hexagon mmp loop 1234,4567 , 789a , abcd , defg , ghi1 which is always given in our figures [ except in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions1 ] ( b ) ] and for which we assume it is present whenever we give a new ks set .",
    "for instance , for 20 - 10 from fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions1 ] ( a ) we just write : h68f , ijk5,1j9b,4kec .",
    "the set 20 - 10 contains the smallest system 18 - 9 . to determine the orientations of its vectors",
    ", we use the program vectorfind .",
    "it gives the component values given in table [ t : tableb ] of [ sec : add ] .",
    "previously , we found two smallest ( 20 - 11 ) ks sets that do not contain the smallest 18 - 9 set ( fig .  4 ( a ) and ( b ) of @xcite ) and two smallest ( 22 - 13 ) sets that contain neither of the previous sets ( fig .  4 ( c ) and ( d ) of @xcite ) .",
    "our new results show that there are two 23 - 14s that contain neither the above 18 - 9 , nor the two 20 - 11s , nor the first of the above 22 - 13s .",
    "one of them , 12ji,1jla,35ce,678k,9abl , cdem , fghn , gnk7 , is given in fig.[fig : solutions1 ] ( c ) .",
    "it contains ( d ) from fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "there are also two 23 - 14s that contain neither the above 18 - 9 , nor the two 20 - 11s , nor the second of the above 22 - 13s .",
    "one of them , 12ji,1j9b,345k , 4kec,6lmb,9abm , fghn , gnl7 , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions2 ] ( a ) .",

    "the vectors component values for the two ks sets are given in table [ t : tableb ] of [ sec : add ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions2 ] ( b ) we give the only set ( 24 - 15 ) that does not contain any of the previous sets .",
    "the set ( c ) is the one which contains all the previous sets .",
    "their mmp notations can easily be read off their figures .",
    "the vector component values for the two 23 - 14 ks sets are given in table [ t : tableb ] of [ sec : add ] .",
    "additional ks sets are given in appendix b.    ks sets with vectors having component values from sets other than \\{-1,0,1 } are less numerous then the ones with values from \\{-1,0,1}. they are not our primary target in this paper and we shall present only several examples below while the exhaustive generation of these sets is under way .  @xcite    all 37 ks sets with 22 through 24 vectors with component values from sets other than \\{-1,0,1 } would have component values from \\{-1,0,1 } if we discarded vectors that share only one tetrad .",
    "but we clearly can not do so because we have to have all vectors in every tetrad to be able to assign 1 to one and 0 to three of them .",
    "this confirms the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "all of these sets contain the 18 - 9 set .",

    "additional such ks sets and vector components the reader can find in @xcite . )",
    "we sum up our results as follows .",
    "all possible 388 ks sets for systems with 4 degrees of freedom with 18 through 23 vectors and 844 ks sets with 24 vectors with component values from \\{-1,0,1 } can be obtained by `` peeling '' vectors off a single system provided  in effect  by peres 20 years ago .",
    "but we would not know that the sets with 18 through 23 vectors obtained by such peeling exhaust all possible ks sets up to 23 vectors without extensive computation we carried out . and the computation would not have been feasible without putting together the theory of hypergraphs , lattice theory , and interval analysis , and many algorithms and programs we devised for the purpose .",
    "among particular features of ks sets we presented in section [ sec : res ] , we would like to single out the one about the so - called _ critical sets _",
    ", i.e. , those ks sets that do not properly contain any ks subset .",
    "@xcite we found out that there are altogether six critical subsets of peres 24 - 24 set .",
    "these are 18 - 9,@xcite 20 - 11,@xcite another 20 - 11 and two 22 - 13s,@xcite and 24 - 15 [ given in fig .  [ fig : solutions2](b ) ]",
    ".    there exist sets with 22 and more vectors with component values that are not from \\{-1,0,1 } and that are not isomorphic to any of the 1,233 sets mentioned above .",
    "unlike the `` @xmath10 - 1,0,1@xmath11 sets , '' they can be obtained only by extensive generation of mmp diagrams and computation of their properties , which we are currently carrying out .",
    "@xcite    as a final note , we mention that all 4-dim ks sets we have considered contain a single hexagon as the biggest loop formed by their tetrads . a geometrical interpretation of this fact is an open question , because in general there is no particular limit on the loop size in non - ks orthogonal tetrads of rays contained in 4-dim hilbert space sets .    * acknowledgements *    supported by the _ ministry of science , education , and sport of croatia _ through _ distributed processing and scientific data visualization _ program and _ quantum computation : parallelism and visualization _ project ( 082 - 0982562 - 3160 ) .",
    "computational support was provided by the cluster _ isabella _ of the _ university computing centre _ of the _ university of zagreb _ and by the _",
    "croatian national grid infrastructure_.",
    "the primary programs used for this project ( and referenced earlier in this paper ) are subgraph , states01 , vectorfind , and subset .",
    "each is a stand - alone ansii c program .",
    "each program typically has several input , output , and other options , which can be listed with the help option by typing e.g.  subgraph help at the unix or linux command - line prompt .",
    "below we describe their main algorithms .",
    "the program subgraph takes as its input two hypergraphs in the form of mmp diagrams , a test graph and a reference graph .",
    "it will indicate whether or not the test graph is a subgraph of the reference graph , using the following algorithm ( suggested by brendan mckay ) .",
    "let the edges of the test graph be @xmath12 and of the reference graph @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "( if @xmath15 , the subgraph relation will fail . )",
    "the problem is to find a sequence @xmath16 such that the mapping @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is an isomorphism .",
    "we construct this sequence one element at a time . for @xmath19 ,",
    "we choose an element from @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , we choose an element from @xmath20 whose relationship ( described below ) to @xmath19 is the same as the relationship of @xmath22 to @xmath23 . if there is no such @xmath21 , we backtrack and choose another @xmath19 .",
    "next , @xmath24 is anything whose relationship to @xmath25 is the same as the relationship of @xmath26 to @xmath27 . and so on , backtracking recursively if necessary until a @xmath28 is found .",
    "if this process is successful , the subgraph relation holds ; if , on the other hand , the backtracking is exhausted , the subgraph relation fails .",
    "we determine the condition `` @xmath29 is in the same relationship to @xmath30 as @xmath31 is to @xmath32 '' as follows .",
    "suppose we have chosen @xmath30 and wish to find the possibilities for @xmath29 .",
    "we look at at @xmath31 : it has ( e.g.  for a 4-dim hypergraph ) 4 vertices , and each is a member of some ( possibly none ) of the edges @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath31 gives a set of 4 subsets ( in terms of indices ) of @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , any edge @xmath35 in the reference graph gives a set of 4 subsets of @xmath34 that say which of the edges @xmath30 contain each of the 4 vertices of @xmath35 .",
    "the choices for @xmath29 are those edges of the reference graph which give the same 4 subsets of @xmath34 as @xmath31 gives ( and of course @xmath29 is different from @xmath30 ) .",
    "the program states01 indicates whether or not an mmp diagram can be assigned a non - dispersive state , in other words whether there exists a 0 - 1 assignment to all vertices such that each edge contains exactly one vertex assigned with 1 .",
    "the program does an exhaustive search of all possible assignments to the mmp diagram , using a fast backtracking algorithm .",
    "more details are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the program vectorfind takes as its input an mmp diagram supplied by the user .",
    "it attempts to assign to each vertex a 3-dim or 4-dim vector ( when the mmp diagram has 3 or 4 vertices per edge respectively ) , such that the following constraints are satisfied : ( 1 ) each vector , chosen from a predetermined set specified by the user , must be unique ( non - parallel to all the others ) , and ( 2 ) the vectors assigned to the vertices in a given edge must be mutually orthogonal ( i.e. have inner product equal to zero ) .",
    "if an assignment is found , it is printed out ; otherwise the failure to find one is indicated .",
    "the algorithm is an exhaustive search of all possible assignments from the used - specified vector set , using recursive backtracking .",
    "a goal of the algorithm is to achieve extremely fast run time ( compared to the more general interval analysis method described in section [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "while worst - case run time can grow exponentially with the number of vertices , typically the program s speed is much faster .",
    "an internal optimisation processes vertices with the most edges before others to encourage early backtracking in the recursive search .",
    "a user - settable timeout will abandon the relatively rare attempts that take too long ( and likely do nt have a solution ) .",
    "for the standard k - s sets in the literature , vector assignments are found almost instantaneously on a desktop computer .      the program subset is a relatively simple utility program that generates all subsets of the set of edges of its input mmp diagram . by default , subsets containing isolated edges ( ones not connected to any other edge ) are suppressed .",
