    "[ 3intro ] quantized general relativity , based upon the einstein - hilbert action @xmath0 is well known to be perturbatively nonrenormalizable .",
    "this has led to the widespread believe that a straightforward quantization of the metric degrees of freedom can not lead to a mathematically consistent and predictive _ fundamental _ theory valid down to arbitrarily small spacetime distances .",
    "einstein gravity was rather considered merely an _ effective _ theory whose range of applicability is limited to a phenomenological description of gravitational effects at distances much larger than the planck length .    in particle physics one",
    "usually considers a theory fundamental if it is perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "the virtue of such models is that one can `` hide '' their infinities in only finitely many basic parameters ( masses , gauge couplings , etc . ) which are intrinsically undetermined within the theory and whose value must be taken from the experiment .",
    "all other couplings are then well - defined computable functions of those few parameters . in nonrenormalizable effective theories , on the other hand",
    ", the divergence structure is such that increasing orders of the loop expansion require an increasing number of new counter terms and , as a consequence , of undetermined free parameters .",
    "typically , at high energies , all these unknown parameters enter on an equal footing so that the theory looses its predictive power .    however , there are examples of field theories which do `` exist '' as fundamental theories despite their perturbative nonrenormalizability @xcite .",
    "these models are `` nonperturbatively renormalizable '' along the lines of wilson s modern formulation of renormalization theory @xcite .",
    "they are constructed by performing the limit of infinite ultraviolet cutoff ( `` continuum limit '' ) at a non - gaussian renormalization group fixed point @xmath1 in the space @xmath2 of all ( dimensionless , essential ) couplings @xmath3 which parametrize a general action functional .",
    "this construction has to be contrasted with the standard perturbative renormalization which , at least implicitly , is based upon the gaussian fixed point at which all couplings vanish , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "[ as ] in his `` asymptotic safety '' scenario weinberg @xcite has put forward the idea that , perhaps , a quantum field theory of gravity can be constructed nonperturbatively by invoking a non - gaussian ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting theory would be `` asymptotically safe '' in the sense that at high energies unphysical singularities are likely to be absent .",
    "the arena in which the idea is formulated is the so - called `` theory space '' . by definition , it is the space of all action functionals @xmath6 $ ] which depend on a given set of fields and are invariant under certain symmetries",
    ". hence the theory space @xmath7\\}$ ] is fixed once the field contents and the symmetries are fixed .",
    "the infinitely many generalized couplings @xmath3 needed to parametrize a general action functional are local coordinates on theory space . in gravity one",
    "deals with functionals @xmath8 $ ] which are required to depend on the metric in a diffeomorphism invariant way .",
    "( the dots represent matter fields and possibly background fields introduced for technical convenience . )",
    "theory space carries a crucial geometric structure , namely a vector field which encodes the effect of a kadanoff - wilson - type block spin or `` coarse graining '' procedure , suitably reformulated in the continuum .",
    "the components @xmath9@xmath10 of this vector field are the beta - functions of the couplings @xmath3 .",
    "they describe the dependence of @xmath11 on the coarse graining scale @xmath12 : @xmath13 by definition , @xmath12 is taken to be a mass scale . roughly speaking the running couplings @xmath14 describe the dynamics of field averages , the averaging volume having a linear extension of the order @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath14 s should be thought of as parametrizing a running action functional @xmath16 $ ] . by definition ,",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) trajectories , i.e. the solutions to the `` exact renormalization group equation '' ( [ rgrho ] ) are the integral curves of the vector field @xmath17 defining the `` rg flow '' .",
    "the asymptotic safety scenario assumes that @xmath18 has a zero at a point with coordinates @xmath1 not all of which are zero .",
    "given such a non - gaussian fixed point ( ngfp ) of the rg flow one defines its uv critical surface @xmath19 to consist of all points of theory space which are attracted into it in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "( note that increasing @xmath12 amounts to going in the direction _",
    "opposite _ to the natural coarse graining flow . )",
    "the dimensionality @xmath21 is given by the number of attractive ( for _ in_creasing cutoff @xmath12 ) directions in the space of couplings .",
    "the linearized flow near the fixed point is governed by the jacobi matrix @xmath22 , @xmath23 : @xmath24 the general solution to this equation reads @xmath25 where the @xmath26 s are the right - eigenvectors of @xmath27 with ( complex ) eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 is a fixed reference scale , and the @xmath30 s are constants of integration .",
    "if @xmath14 is to approach @xmath1 in the infinite cutoff limit @xmath20 we must set @xmath31 for all @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "hence the dimensionality @xmath34 equals the number of @xmath27-eigenvalues with a negative real part , i.e. the number of @xmath35 s with a positive real part .",
    "a specific quantum field theory is defined by a rg trajectory which exists globally , i.e. is well behaved all the way down from `` @xmath36 '' in the uv to @xmath37 in the ir . the key idea of asymptotic safety is to base the theory upon one of the trajectories running inside the hypersurface @xmath19 since these trajectories are manifestly well - behaved and free from fatal singularities ( blowing up couplings , etc . ) in the large@xmath38 limit .",
    "moreover , a theory based upon a trajectory inside @xmath19 can be predictive , the problem of an increasing number of counter terms and undetermined parameters which plagues effective theory does not arise .",
    "in fact , in order to select a specific quantum theory we have to fix @xmath34 free parameters which are not predicted by the theory and must be taken from experiment .",
    "when we _ lower _ the cutoff , only @xmath34 parameters in the initial action are `` relevant '' , and fixing these parameters amounts to picking a specific trajectory on @xmath19 ; the remaining `` irrelevant '' parameters are all attracted towards @xmath19 automatically .",
    "therefore the theory has the more predictive power the smaller is the dimensionality of @xmath19 , i.e. the fewer uv attractive eigendirections the non - gaussian fixed point has .",
    "if @xmath39 , the quantum field theory thus constructed is as predictive as a perturbatively renormalizable model with @xmath34 `` renormalizable couplings '' , i.e. couplings relevant at the gaussian fixed point .",
    "it is plausible that @xmath19 is indeed finite dimensional . if the dimensionless @xmath3 s arise as @xmath40 by rescaling ( with the cutoff @xmath12 ) the original couplings @xmath41 with mass dimensions @xmath42 , then @xmath43 and @xmath44 where the dots stand for the quantum corrections . ignoring them , @xmath45 , and @xmath34 equals the number of positive @xmath42 s .",
    "since adding derivatives or powers of fields to a monomial in the action always lowers @xmath42 , there can be at most a finite number of positive @xmath42 s and , therefore , of negative eigenvalues of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , barring the presumably rather exotic possibility that the quantum corrections change the signs of infinitely many elements in @xmath27 , the dimensionality of @xmath19 is finite @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in general the uv fixed point on which the above construction is based , if it exists , has no reason to be of the simple einstein - hilbert form ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "the initial point of the rg trajectory @xmath46 is expected to contain many more invariants , both local ( curvature polynomials ) and nonlocal ones .",
    "for this reason the asymptotic safety scenario is _ not _ a quantization of general relativity , and it can not be compared in this respect to the loop quantum gravity approach , for instance . in a conventional field theory setting",
    "the functional @xmath46 corresponds to the bare ( or `` classical '' ) action @xmath47 which usually can be chosen ( almost ) freely .",
    "it is one of the many attractive features of the asymptotic safety scenario that the bare action is fixed by the theory itself and actually can be _ computed _ , namely by searching for zeros of @xmath18 . in this respect",
    "it has , almost by construction , a degree of predictivity which can not be reached by any scheme trying to quantize a given classical action .",
    "[ eaa ] during the past few years , the asymptotic safety scenario in quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) has been mostly investigated in the framework of the effective average action @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , a specific formulation of the wilsonian rg which originally was developed for theories in flat space @xcite and has been first applied to gravity in @xcite .    quite generally , the effective average action @xmath48 is a coarse grained free energy functional that describes the behavior of the theory at the mass scale @xmath12 .",
    "it contains the quantum effects of all fluctuations of the dynamical variables with momenta larger than @xmath12 , but not of those with momenta smaller than @xmath12 . as @xmath12 is decreased , an increasing number of degrees of freedom is integrated out .",
    "the method thus complies , at an intuitive level , with the coarse graining picture of the previous section .",
    "the successive averaging of the fluctuation variable is achieved by a @xmath12-dependent ir cutoff term @xmath49 which is added to the classical action in the standard euclidean functional integral .",
    "this term gives a momentum dependent mass square @xmath50 to the field modes with momentum @xmath51 .",
    "it is designed to vanish if @xmath52 , but suppresses the contributions of the modes with @xmath53 to the path integral . when regarded as a function of @xmath12",
    ", @xmath48 describes a curve in theory space that interpolates between the classical action @xmath54 and the conventional effective action @xmath55 .",
    "the change of @xmath48 induced by an infinitesimal change of @xmath12 is described by a functional differential equation , the exact rg equation . in a symbolic notation",
    "it reads @xmath56\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a detailed discussion of this equation we must refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "suffice it to say that , expanding @xmath57 $ ] in terms of diffeomorphism invariant field monomials @xmath58 $ ] with coefficients @xmath14 , eq . ( [ newrg ] ) assumes the component form ( [ rgrho ] ) .    in general it is impossible to find exact solutions to eq .",
    "( [ newrg ] ) and we are forced to rely upon approximations . a powerful nonperturbative approximation scheme is the truncation of theory space where the rg flow is projected onto a finite - dimensional subspace . in practice",
    "one makes an ansatz for @xmath48 that comprises only a few couplings and inserts it into the rg equation .",
    "this leads to a , now finite , set of coupled differential equations of the form ( [ rgrho ] ) .",
    "the simplest approximation one might try is the `` einstein - hilbert truncation '' @xcite defined by the ansatz @xmath59=\\left(16\\pi g_k\\right)^{-1}\\int d^dx\\,\\sqrt{g}\\left\\ { -r(g)+2\\bar{\\lambda}_k\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it applies to a @xmath60-dimensional euclidean spacetime and involves only the cosmological constant @xmath61 and the newton constant @xmath62 as running parameters . inserting ( [ in2 ] ) into the rg equation ( [ newrg ] )",
    "one obtains a set of two @xmath63-functions @xmath64 for the dimensionless cosmological constant @xmath65 and the dimensionless newton constant @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "they describe a two - dimensional rg flow on the plane with coordinates @xmath67 and @xmath68 . at a fixed point @xmath69 ,",
    "both @xmath63-functions vanish simultaneously . in the einstein - hilbert truncation there",
    "exists both a trivial gaussian fixed point ( gfp ) at @xmath70 and , quite remarkably , also a uv attractive ngfp at @xmath71 .",
    "= 0.99    in fig .",
    "[ 1.eins ] we show part of the @xmath72-@xmath73 theory space and the corresponding rg flow for @xmath74 .",
    "the trajectories are obtained by numerically integrating the differential equations @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the arrows point in the direction of increasing coarse graining ,",
    "i.e. from the uv towards the ir .",
    "we observe that three types of trajectories emanate from the ngfp : those of type ia ( type iiia ) run towards negative ( positive ) cosmological constants , while the `` separatrix '' , the unique trajectory ( of type iia ) crossing over from the ngfp to the gfp , has a vanishing cosmological constant in the ir .",
    "the flow is defined on the half - plane @xmath77 only ; it can not be continued beyond @xmath78 as the @xmath9-functions become singular there .",
    "in fact , the type iiia - trajectories can not be integrated down to @xmath37 within the einstein - hilbert approximation .",
    "they terminate at a non - zero @xmath79 where they run into the @xmath80singularity . near @xmath79",
    "a more general truncation is needed in order to continue the flow .    in weinberg s original paper",
    "@xcite the asymptotic safety idea was tested in @xmath81 dimensions where @xmath82 was chosen so that the @xmath9-functions ( actually @xmath83 only ) could be found by an @xmath84-expansion . before the advent of the exact rg equations",
    "no practical tool was known which would have allowed a nonperturbative calculation of the @xmath9-functions in the physically interesting case of @xmath74 spacetime dimensions .",
    "however , as we saw above , the effective average action in the einstein - hilbert approximation does indeed predict the existence of a ngfp in a nonperturbative setting .",
    "it was first analyzed in @xcite , and also first investigations of its possible role in black hole physics @xcite and cosmology @xcite were performed already .",
    "the detailed analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the ngfp found has all the properties necessary for asymptotic safety .",
    "in particular one has a pair of complex conjugate critical exponents @xmath85 with @xmath86 , implying that the ngfp , for @xmath20 , attracts all trajectories in the half - plane @xmath87 .",
    "( the lower half - plane @xmath88 is unphysical probably since it corresponds to a negative newton constant . ) because of the nonvanishing imaginary part @xmath89 , all trajectories spiral around the ngfp before hitting it .",
    "the question of crucial importance is whether the fixed point predicted by the einstein - hilbert truncation actually approximates a fixed point in the exact theory , or whether it is an artifact of the truncation . in refs .",
    "@xcite evidence was found which , in our opinion , strongly supports the hypothesis that there does indeed exist a non - gaussian fixed point in the exact 4-dimensional theory , with exactly the properties required for the asymptotic safety scenario . in these investigations the reliability of the einstein - hilbert truncation was tested both by analyzing the cutoff scheme dependence within this truncation @xcite and by generalizing the truncation ansatz itself @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the first method is as follows .",
    "the cutoff operator @xmath50 is specified by a matrix in field space and a `` shape function '' @xmath90 which describes the details of how the modes get suppressed in the ir when @xmath91 drops below @xmath92 .",
    "we checked the cutoff scheme dependence of the various quantities of interest both by looking at their dependence on the function @xmath93 and comparing two different matrix structures .",
    "universal quantities are particularly important in this respect because , by definition , they are strictly cutoff scheme independent in the exact theory .",
    "any truncation leads to a residual scheme dependence of these quantities , however .",
    "its magnitude is a natural indicator for the quality of the truncation @xcite .",
    "typical examples of universal quantities are the critical exponents @xmath35 .",
    "the existence or nonexistence of a fixed point is also a universal , scheme independent feature , but its precise location in parameter space is scheme dependent .",
    "nevertheless it can be shown that , in @xmath74 , the product @xmath94 must be universal @xcite while @xmath95 and @xmath96 separately are not .",
    "the detailed numerical analysis of the einstein - hilbert rg flow near the ngfp @xcite shows that the universal quantities , in particular the product @xmath97 , are indeed scheme independent at a quite impressive level of accuracy . as the many numerical `` miracles '' which lead to the almost perfect cancellation of the @xmath93-dependence would have no reason to occur if there was not a fixed point in the exact theory as an organizing principle , the results of this analysis can be considered strong evidence in favor of a fixed point in the exact , un - truncated theory .",
    "the ultimate justification of any truncation is that when one adds further terms to it its physical predictions do not change significantly any more . as a first step towards testing the stability of the einstein - hilbert truncation against the inclusion of other invariants",
    "@xcite we took a @xmath98-term into account : @xmath99=\\int d^dx\\,\\sqrt{g}\\left\\{\\left(16\\pi g_k\\right)^{-1 } \\left[-r(g)+2\\bar{\\lambda}_k\\right]+\\bar{\\beta}_k\\,r^2(g)\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting ( [ p2.4 ] ) into the functional rg equation yields a set of @xmath63-functions @xmath100 for the dimensionless couplings @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "they describe the rg flow on the three - dimensional @xmath73-@xmath72-@xmath104space . despite the extreme algebraic complexity of the three @xmath9-functions it was possible to show @xcite that they , too , admit a ngfp @xmath105 with exactly the properties needed for asymptotic safety . in particular it turned out to be uv attractive in all three directions .",
    "the value of @xmath106 is extremely tiny , and close to the ngfp the projection of the 3-dimensional flow onto the @xmath73-@xmath107subspace is very well described by the einstein - hilbert truncation which ignores the third direction from the outset .",
    "the @xmath96- and @xmath95-values and the critical exponents related to the flow in the @xmath73-@xmath107subspace , as predicted by the 3-dimensional truncation , agree almost perfectly with those from the einstein - hilbert approximation .",
    "analyzing the scheme dependence of the universal quantities one finds again a highly remarkable @xmath93-independence @xmath108 which is truly amazing if one visualizes the huge amount of nontrivial numerical compensations and cancellations among several dozens of @xmath93-dependent terms which is necessary to make @xmath97 , say , approximately independent of the shape function @xmath93 .    on the basis of these results",
    "we believe that the non - gaussian fixed point occuring in the einstein - hilbert truncation is very unlikely to be an artifact of this truncation but rather may be considered the projection of a ngfp in the exact theory .",
    "the fixed point and all its qualitative properties are stable against variations of the cutoff and the inclusion of a further invariant in the truncation .",
    "it is particularly remarkable that within the scheme dependence the additional @xmath109-term has essentially no impact on the fixed point .",
    "these are certainly very nontrivial indications supporting the conjecture that 4-dimensional qeg indeed possesses a rg fixed point with the properties needed for its nonperturbative renormalizability .",
    "this view is further supported by two conceptually independent investigations . in ref .",
    "@xcite a proper time renormalization group equation rather than the flow equation of the average action has been used , and again a suitable ngfp was found .",
    "this framework is conceptually somewhat simpler than that of the effective average action ; it amounts to an rg - improved 1-loop calculation with an ir cutoff .",
    "furthermore , in refs .",
    "@xcite the functional integral over the subsector of metrics admitting two killing vectors has been performed _",
    "exactly _ , and again a ngfp was found , this time in a setting and an approximation which is _ very _ different from that of the truncated @xmath48-flows . as for the inclusion of matter fields , both in the average action @xcite and the symmetry reduction approach @xcite",
    "a suitable ngfp has been established for a broad class of matter systems .",
    "[ sdm ] in the following we take the existence of a suitable ngfp on the full theory space for granted and explore some of the properties of asymptotic safety , in particular we try to gain some understanding of what a `` quantum spacetime '' is like . unless stated otherwise we consider pure euclidean gravity in @xmath74 .",

    "but since the quantum spacetime is characterized by the infinity of metrics @xmath117 it can acquire very nonclassical and in particular fractal features .",
    "in fact , every proper distance calculated from @xmath112 is unavoidably scale dependent .",

    "the trajectories cross over towards the gfp .",
    "since we are interested only in the limiting cases of very small and very large distances the following caricature of a rg trajectory will be sufficient .",

    "without matter , @xmath152 since in absence of dimensionful constants of integration @xmath61 is the only quantity in this equation which sets a scale , every solution to ( [ einsteq ] ) has a typical radius of curvature @xmath153 .",

    "once @xmath114 is smaller than the planck length @xmath157 we are in the fixed point regime where @xmath158 so that @xmath159 , or @xmath160 thus , when we look at the structure of spacetime with a microscope of resolution @xmath145 , the average radius of curvature which we measure is proportional to the resolution itself .",
    "if we want to probe finer details and decrease @xmath114 we automatically decrease @xmath161 and hence _ in_crease the average curvature .",
    "spacetime seems to be more strongly curved at small distances than at larger ones .",
    "the scale - free relation ( [ radius ] ) suggests that at distances below the planck length the qeg spacetime is a special kind of fractal with a self - similar structure .",
    "it has no intrinsic scale because in the fractal regime , i.e. when the rg trajectory is still close to the ngfp , the parameters which usually set the scales of the gravitational interaction , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , are not yet `` frozen out '' .",

    "@xcite the qeg spacetime has an effective dimensionality which is @xmath12-dependent and hence noninteger in general .",

    "the effective dimensionality is 4 for @xmath143 and 2 for @xmath145 .",

    "we can use this information in order to determine the momentum dependence of the dressed graviton propagator for momenta @xmath183 . expanding the @xmath48 of ( [ in2 ] ) about flat space and omitting the standard tensor structures we find the inverse propagator @xmath184 .",
    "the conventional dressed propagator @xmath185 , the one contained in @xmath186 , obtains from the exact @xmath187 by taking the limit @xmath179 . for @xmath188",

    "the dressed propagator is @xmath198 which has the following representation in position space : @xmath199 here @xmath200 is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of a mass .",
    "obviously ( [ gp3 ] ) has the same form as a @xmath201-propagator in 2 dimensions .    slightly away from the ngfp , before other physical scales intervene , the propagator is of the familiar type ( [ gp2 ] ) which shows that the quantity @xmath146 has the standard interpretation of an anomalous dimension in the sense that fluctuation effects modify the decay properties of @xmath202 so as to correspond to a spacetime of effective dimensionality @xmath177 .",
    "thus the properties of the rg trajectories imply the following `` dimensional reduction '' : spacetime , probed by a `` graviton '' with @xmath203 is 4-dimensional , but it appears to be 2-dimensional for a graviton with @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in @xmath60 classical dimensions , where the macroscopic spacetime is @xmath60-dimensional , the anomalous dimension at the fixed point is @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath60 , the dimensionality of the fractal as implied by @xmath146 is @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "[ specdimen ] next we turn to the spectral dimension @xmath207 of the qeg spacetimes .",

    "thus , knowing the function @xmath219 , one can recover the dimensionality of the target manifold as the @xmath212-independent logarithmic derivative @xmath223 .",
    "this formula can also be used for curved spaces and spaces with finite volume @xmath224 provided @xmath212 is not taken too large @xcite .    in qeg where we functionally integrate over all metrics",
    "it is natural to replace @xmath225 by its expectation value .",

    "( [ fe ] ) . in the following we exploit this relationship for the rhs of the diffusion equation , @xmath237 .",
    "it is crucial here to correctly identify the relevant scale @xmath12 .",

    "however , in general the @xmath249 s are different from zero over a wide range of eigenvalues . in this case",
    "we face a multiscale problem where different modes @xmath241 probe the spacetime on different length scales .    if @xmath231 corresponds to flat space , say , the eigenfunctions @xmath252 are plane waves with momentum @xmath253 , and they resolve structures on a length scale @xmath114 of order @xmath254 .",
    "hence , in terms of the eigenvalue @xmath255 the resolution is @xmath256 .",
    "this suggests that when the manifold is probed by a mode with eigenvalue @xmath240 it `` sees '' the metric @xmath112 for the scale @xmath257 .",
    "actually the identification @xmath257 is correct also for curved space since , in the construction of @xmath48 , the parameter @xmath12 is introduced precisely as a cutoff in the spectrum of the covariant laplacian .",

    "( [ trplane ] ) yields @xmath270 , and we conclude that the macroscopic spectral dimension is @xmath271 .",

    "this result holds for all rg trajectories since only the fixed point properties were used . in particular",
    "it is independent of @xmath277 on macroscopic scales .",
    "indeed , the above assumption that @xmath263 is flat was not necessary for obtaining @xmath276 .",
    "this follows from the fact that even for a curved metric the spectral sum ( [ trpropk ] ) can be represented by an euler - mac laurin series which always implies ( [ trplane ] ) as the leading term for @xmath220 .",
    "thus we may conclude that on very large and very small length scales the spectral dimensions of the qeg spacetimes are @xmath278 the dimensionality of the fractal at sub - planckian distances is found to be 2 again , as in the first argument based upon @xmath146 .",
    "remarkably , the equality of @xmath279 and @xmath207 is a special feature of 4 classical dimensions .",
    "generalizing for @xmath60 classical dimensions , the fixed point running of newton s constant becomes @xmath280 with a dimension - dependent exponent , while @xmath158 continues to have a quadratic @xmath12-dependence . as a result , the @xmath281 of eq .",
    "( [ gp1 ] ) is proportional to @xmath282 in general so that , for any @xmath60 , the 2-dimensional looking graviton propagator ( [ gp3 ] ) is obtained .",

    "this @xmath212-dependence implies the spectral dimension @xmath286 this value coincides with @xmath287 if , and only if , @xmath74 .",
    "it is an intriguing speculation that this could have something to do with the observed macroscopic dimensionality of spacetime .    for the sake of clarity and to be as explicit as possible we described the computation of @xmath207 within the einstein - hilbert truncation .",
    "however , it is easy to see @xcite that the only nontrivial ingredient of this computation , the scaling behavior @xmath288 , is in fact an exact consequence of asymptotic safety .",
    "if the fixed point exists , simple dimensional analysis implies @xmath288 at the un - truncated level , and this in turn gives rise to ( [ qegspecdims2 ] ) . if qeg is asymptotically safe , @xmath276 at sub - planckian distances is an _ exact _ nonperturbative result for all of its spacetimes .",
    "it is interesting to compare the result ( [ qegspecdims ] ) to the spectral dimensions which were recently obtained by monte carlo simulations of the causal dynamical triangulation model of quantum gravity @xcite : @xmath289 these figures , too , suggest that the long - distance and short - distance spectral dimension should be 4 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the dimensional reduction from 4 to 2 dimensions is a highly nontrivial dynamical phenomenon which seems to occur in both qeg and the discrete triangulation model .",
    "we find it quite remarkable that the discrete and the continuum approach lead to essentially identical conclusions in this respect .",
    "this could be a first hint indicating that the discrete model and qeg in the average action formulation describe the same physics .",
    "[ conclusio ] in the first part of this article we reviewed the asymptotic safety scenario of quantum gravity , and the evidence supporting it coming from the average action approach .",
    "we explained why it is indeed rather likely that 4-dimensional quantum einstein gravity can be defined ( `` renormalized '' ) nonperturbatively along the lines of asymptotic safety .",
    "the conclusion is that it seems quite possible to construct a quantum field theory of the spacetime metric which is not only an effective , but rather a fundamental one and which is mathematically consistent and predictive on the smallest possible length scales even .",
    "if so , it is not necessary to leave the realm of quantum field theory in order to construct a satisfactory quantum gravity .",
    "this is at variance with the basic credo of string theory , for instance , which is also claimed to provide a consistent gravity theory . here",
    "a very high price has to be paid for curing the problems of perturbative gravity , however : one has to live with infinitely many ( unobserved ) matter fields .    in the second part of this review we described the spacetime structure in nonperturbative , asymptotically safe gravity .",
    "the general picture of the qeg spacetimes which emerged is as follows . at sub - planckian distances spacetime",
    "is a fractal of dimensionality @xmath290 .",
    "it can be thought of as a self - similar hierarchy of superimposed riemannian manifolds of any curvature . as one considers larger length scales where the rg running of the gravitational parameters comes to a halt , the `` ripples '' in the spacetime gradually disappear and the structure of a classical 4-dimensional manifold is recovered .",
