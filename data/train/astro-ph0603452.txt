    "was launched on 2001 june 30 and began taking survey data on 2001 august 10 with its 20 high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) based radiometers .",
    "a suite of papers @xcite describing the design of the observatory and the results of the first year s observations have been previously published .",
    "analysis of the first three years of  data has now been completed and the results are presented in companion papers  @xcite .",
    "one of the major design goals of   was the careful control of systematic errors to allow the production of high quality maps of the microwave sky .",
    "systematic errors in the first year results were analyzed in several papers accompanying the data release .",

    "details of the data processing and related errors were discussed in @xcite .",
    "radiometer performance and systematic errors were analyzed in @xcite and @xcite while errors related to sidelobe pickup were explored in @xcite .",
    "this paper updates and extends the previous analyses through the use of three years of observational data and addresses additional issues , such as data processing specific to the production of polarization maps . the overall instrument performance and improvements to the instrument modeling are described in   [ sec : inst_perf_and_model ] . included in this section",

    "the  spacecraft and instrument continued to perform normally throughout its second and third years of science data collection , spanning 2002 august 10 through 2004 august 9 .",
    "two station - keeping maneuvers were performed during each of the second and third years of  observations .",
    "each of these maneuvers resulted in the loss of approximately 10 h of science data , approximately 0.5 h for the maneuver itself and the remainder for the recovery from the thermal disturbance to the observatory .",
    "the observatory also entered a safe - hold mode on 2003 10 aug , believed to be the result of a cosmic ray event .",
    "this occurrence resulted in a loss of approximately 60 h of data , caused both by the time spent in safe hold mode itself , and the time required for observatory temperatures to re - stabilize after the associated thermal disturbance .",
    "these periods , plus a short ( @xmath7 h ) data loss due to a data recorder overflow caused by ground station difficulties that occurred on 2003 may 25 , resulted in the loss of a total of 103 h of science data , resulting in an overall observing efficiency of @xmath8 for s second and third years of observations .",
    "a tabulation of the times of the data excluded from processing by the aforementioned events can be found in @xcite .    during the second and third years of operation ,",
    "8 sudden jumps were observed in the outputs of the radiometers .",
    "these events , distributed among 5 of the 20 radiometers comprising , are believed to be the result of sudden releases of thermally induced mechanical stresses that slightly alter the properties of some radiometer components @xcite . during the first year of operation , 21 such events were observed .",
    "it is believed that the reduction in the number of events is the result of a more stable thermal environment during the second and third years of operation .",
    "although the events are of short duration , the data processing used to produce the sky maps requires that a 2 - 4 h segment of data for the affected radiometer be excluded from the final processing to avoid artifacts in the sky maps .",
    "all 8 events taken together caused a loss of @xmath9 of the science data from the second and third year of observations .",
    "providing a stable thermal environment for the  instrument is a key component in the production of a high quality data set with well defined systematic error limits .",
    "of particular importance are temperature variations synchronous with the 129 s spin period of the observatory .",
    "the methods used to design and predict the thermal environment of the instrument and how they affect the instrument performance are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "on orbit , 56 high - resolution platinum - resistance thermometers monitor the temperature of key instrument components .",
    "these data provide verification that the actual thermal stability meets design specifications and allow for estimates of spurious signal levels resulting from radiometer thermal fluctuations .",
    "analysis of the flight thermal data indicates the expected annual temperature modulation arising from the eccentricity of s orbit and the asymptotic gradual warming of the instrument components as the thermal blankets degrade from ultraviolet exposure .",
    "values characterizing the annual temperature modulation and gradual warming of the instrument components are presented in table  [ table : thermal_perf ] .",
    "the slow warming of the instrument components has increased the radiometer noise levels by @xmath10 based on analysis of the noise in the sky maps as presented in   [ sec : map_noise ] .",

    "significant spin - synchronous temperature variations are detected in 10 of the 13 thermometers attached to the thermal reflector system ( trs ) with peak - to - peak variations ranging from @xmath11 .",
    "similar variations were seen during the first year of observations @xcite and were identified as the result of impulsive heating by solar radiation scattered off the rim of the solar array .",

    "the measured temperature profile as a function of solar azimuth with respect to the observatory follows the same pattern for all 3 years of data .",

    "boresight directions are computed separately for each jupiter season , and differences between the individual seasonal determinations are noted . during the first year of  observations , the azimuthal beam positions found for the first two jupiter seasons",
    "agreed to better than @xmath25 , but the elevation positions differed by @xmath26 .",
    "this small difference was consistent with expected error in the spacecraft quaternions and was treated as part of the error budget rather than being actively corrected .",
    "the second year of  operation provided two additional jupiter observing seasons , 2002 nov 01 - 2002 dec 26 and 2003 mar 13 - 2003 may 08 . with the addition of the third season , it was found that , while azimuthal positions were stable , the apparent elevations of the beams relative to the spin axis of the satellite now differed by @xmath27 from the positions originally computed from the first jupiter season .",
    "jupiter observations from season 4 confirmed the systematic change in elevation . by comparing the attitude measurements of the two star trackers and the radiometric jupiter observations ,",
    "the systematic variation was traced to a temperature dependent flexure occurring in the spacecraft structure , which altered the pointing of the star trackers relative to the microwave telescope s beams .",
    "processing of the 3-year   data assumes a linear dependence of apparent star tracker elevation with spacecraft temperature , and corrects the spacecraft quaternions appropriately .",
    "a new set of line - of - sight vectors describing the telescope beam positions for use with the updated quaternions is available with the data release .",
    "the resulting pointing corrections are small compared to the size of the beams @xmath28 and therefore produce negligible changes to signals in the maps , but will slightly change the noise patterns since observations near pixel borders may have moved into adjacent pixels relative to the first year analysis . based on the data from the six jupiter seasons , residual pointing errors after application of the corrections are estimated to be @xmath29 . a detailed description of the modeling of the pointing correction is contained in  @xcite .",
    "the year-1 analysis of the   data employed a model that related small changes in the radiometer gains ( typically @xmath30 1 % ) to values of radiometer housekeeping data based on a physical model of the radiometer performance @xcite .",
    "each detector was modeled separately and used the measured values of the fpa temperature , @xmath31 , the radio frequency ( rf ) bias powers on the detectors , @xmath32 , and three parameters determined by fitting the model to the hourly gain measurements , obtained from the cmb dipole signal .",
    "the form of the model used in the year-1 analysis was @xmath33 the parameter @xmath34 characterizes compression ( non - linear response ) of the amplifiers and detectors , @xmath35 characterizes the variation of the noise temperature of the input amplifiers with physical temperature , and @xmath36 normalizes the overall gain .",
    "an example of the gain model performance fit to the hourly dipole - based gain measurements can be found in @xcite .",
    "when the gain models fit to the first year observation data were extended to the 3-year data significant deviations became evident .",
    "these deviations became apparent as the input housekeeping data to the model ( @xmath32 and @xmath31 ) spanned a larger range than was used to fit the model , due to the slow warming of the observatory .",
    "re - fitting the original gain model parameters ( @xmath37 and @xmath36 ) greatly improved the agreement between the model and dipole derived gain measurements , but significant errors still were evident .",
    "an additional term was added to the model to account for the _ variation _ of the compression of the amplifiers and square law diode detectors with their physical temperature by allowing the parameter characterizing the nonlinearity to have a weak temperature dependence .",
    "the resulting form of the gain model is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the temperature ( in kelvin ) of the rxb thermometer closest to the detector and @xmath40 is an additional parameter to be fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : gain_model ] shows the dipole derived gain measurements for the v223 detector and the improved gain model for this detector , fit to the entire 3 years of data . also shown in this figure is the original gain model , using model parameters fit to year-1 data only , but applied to the entire 3 years of data .",
    "the new model significantly improves the fit over the entire 3 year period .",
    "the first - year analysis implemented a small , time dependent weighting of the tod using the denominator of equation  ( [ eqn : p1_gain_model ] ) as a measure of the input referenced noise temperature of the hemt amplifiers .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath40 are strongly coupled in the current gain model and are not independently determined with high accuracy .",
    "it is therefore not possible to use the denominator of equation  ( [ eqn : p2_gain_model ] ) as a measure of the radiometer noise levels .",
    "the three year processing therefore assumes uniform radiometer noise within each year .",
    "we maintain the year-1 estimate of the absolute sky map calibration uncertainty of @xmath42 .",
    "comparison of the year-1 and 3-year gain models indicated that many of the year-1 gain models displayed small errors in the predicted gain roughly linear in time , with an error on the order of @xmath43 .    for each da ,",
    "difference maps were formed by subtracting maps processed with the original gain model from those processed with the improved gain model .",
    "these maps displayed a feature with a several micro - kelvin quadrupolar component , an example of which is presented in figure [ fig : v2yr1-v2yr2 ] .",
    "this signal was found to have similar morphologies in many of the maps with its amplitude correlated to the difference between the mean slopes of original and improved gain models .",
    "no other multipoles show significant correlation with the mean slopes of the gain models .",
    "( sinusoidal differences between the gain models with an annual period were also examined and showed no correlations with any multipole of the difference maps . ) these small errors in the gain model resulted in errors in subtraction of the @xmath44 dipole signal . when processed through the map - making pipeline",
    "this residual dipole signal yielded a systematic feature with a quadrupolar component common to many of the sky maps .",
    "since the form of the residual gain error was common to many of the radiometers the resultant spurious quadrupolar features were aligned , resulting in a biased measurement of the quadrupole moments in both the auto and cross power spectra @xcite .",
    "the alignment of this spurious feature was such that it partially canceled the true sky quadrupole signal .",
    "correction of this systematic error accounts for a part of the small increase in the reported value of the quadrupole moment , @xmath45 , from @xmath46 in the year-1 release  @xcite to @xmath47 , the largest change being the result of the change of the estimator use to evaluate the quadrupole  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the current value is still far smaller than the mean expected value of @xmath48 obtained from the best fit @xmath49-dominated cold dark matter models  @xcite .",
    "estimates of residual quadrupolar contamination remaining in the maps processed with the improved gain model are obtained by multiplying a coefficient relating the amplitude of the spurious quadrupolar signal to the slope error in the gain model , @xmath50 , by an estimate of the residual slope error in the improved gain model , @xmath51 .",
    "the value of @xmath52 was obtained by a linear fit to the data contained in figure [ fig : c2_vs_dg ] constrained to pass through the origin . the residual slope error in the gain model , @xmath53 ,",
    "was estimated as the sum of two terms : a fit to the residuals of the gain model to the dipole based gain measurements , and a term to allow for a possible bias in the slope of the dipole based gain determinations . the value of this second term was obtained from simulations of the complete calibration algorithm including effects of far sidelobe pickup of galactic and dipole signals .",
    "these simulations indicate that the hourly dipole based gain measurements have slope biases ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "the magnitudes of these biases were summed with the magnitudes of the residual errors between the dipole based gain determinations and the gain model to yield an estimate @xmath53 .",
    "values of @xmath53 are all less than @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting estimates of the magnitude of possible spurious quadrupolar signals in the 3-year maps are plotted in red in figure [ fig : c2_vs_dg ] .",
    "an estimate of spurious contributions to @xmath57 is obtained by calculating the quantity @xmath58 where the average is over the ka - w band das , and the nominal value for the quadrupole moment is taken as @xmath59 .",
    "the resultant estimate of the uncertainty on the quadrupole moment arising from gain model errors , @xmath60 , is @xmath61 .",
    "the outputs of the  radiometers exhibit excess power at low frequencies characterized by a `` 1/f knee frequency '' , @xmath62 as described in @xcite .",
    "production of sky maps involves application of a filter to the tod , as described in  [ sec : cgmaps ] .",
    "these filters are derived from fits to the autocorrelation function of the tod after removal of an estimated sky signal based on preliminary sky maps .",
    "the measured autocorrelation functions for each radiometer are parameterized as @xmath63 ^ 2 + d [ \\log(|\\delta t|)]^3 ,   & \\mbox{$ 1 < |\\delta t| < \\delta t_{\\rm max}$,}\\\\ 0 & \\mbox{$ |\\delta t| \\geq \\delta t_{\\rm max}$ } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the time lag between data points in units of samples , the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are determined by fitting to the autocorrelation data , and @xmath70 is the time lag at which the fit crosses zero , typically @xmath71 s. these fits were performed on a year - by - year basis to allow for gradual changes in the radiometer noise characteristics , even though the radiometer noise properties are very stable .",
    "an example of this procedure is presented in the top panel of figure [ fig : acf_filter ] , which presents the measured autocorrelation data and the parameterized fit for the year-3 observations of the w11 radiometer .    tabulated values of the parameterized filter coefficients for all years and das are available with the data release .",
    "the year-1  analysis included a measurement of a set of transmission imbalance factors , @xmath72 , characterizing the different transmission of sky signals from the a side and b side optics into the radiometers .",
    "the response , @xmath73 , of the  radiometers to sky signals @xmath74 and @xmath75 may be written @xmath76 where the @xmath72 factors parameterize a departure from ideal differential radiometer performance , specifically the level of response to common mode input signals  @xcite .",
    "for an ideal differential radiometer @xmath77 , and the radiometer exhibits no response to common mode signal .",
    "the transmission imbalance factors are determined by fitting the raw tod to templates composed of pure differential and pure common mode signals originating from the cmb dipole anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the year-1 analysis was performed using 232 days of data , and did not remove an estimate of galactic emission and cmb anisotropy before performing the fits , since reliable sky maps were not available at the time the analysis was performed .",
    "the 3-year analysis improves on the previous analysis in two respects ; 1 ) estimates of the galactic and cmb anisotropy signals are removed from the tod , leaving only the dipole signal , before fitting to the aforementioned templates , and 2 ) three years of tod are used in the analysis .",
    "a fit to all three years of data was used to determine the values of the transmission imbalance factors , which are presented in table  [ tab : transmission_imbalance ] .",
    "these values agree with those from the year-1 analysis to the degree expected , but are more accurate due to the improvements in the processing .",

    "the shape of the measured power spectrum , and through that the values of the cosmological parameters , depends on the beam window functions . in turn , the beam window functions are determined from the shapes of the beam profiles .",
    "uncertainties in the beam profile at the -20  dbi level ( 30 to 40 db down from the peak , near the noise level of the measurements ) can influence the window function at the 1% level .",
    "this sensitivity has motivated an extensive investigation of the beams .",
    "the beam modeling we present here is based on six seasons of jupiter data acquired over three years of observations .",
    "the modeling has been significantly enhanced and the approximations made for the first year analysis have been reexamined . with the new models",
    ", the beam profiles can be extrapolated below the noise level of the maps , thereby obviating the cutoff radius , @xmath98 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is found that on average the beam solid angles are systematically larger by 1% than the year-1 estimates , leading to a systematic decrease in the window functions at @xmath99 , leading in turn to a systematic increase in the power spectrum .",
    "for example in the @xmath100 range , the new combined v and w band window functions are 1.5% lower ( @xmath101 ) than the same combination for year one , justifying the assumptions and treatment in the year-1 release .",
    "we retain nearly the same uncertainties on the window function that were given for year-1 .",
    "the co- and cross - polarization beam profiles for the a side are shown in figure  [ fig : focalplane ] .",
    "these update previous versions of the figures by including the cross - polar response and data further into the tail of the beams .",
    "the figures are based on pre - flight data , though the general agreement between the projections and measurements of jupiter is excellent .",
    "the predicted and measured cross - polar patterns are in general agreement .",
    "the cross polar response of the main beam can be parameterized as a combination of a rotation of the linear polarization reference axis around the line of sight , and a coupling to the stokes v component .",
    "the relative magnitudes of these two components depends on the phase of the cross - polar coupling .",
    "the two outputs from each feed horn are coupled to different radiometers , so  is not directly sensitive to this phase .",
    "while neither of these components can produce an errant polarization signal from an unpolarized input signal , they do affect the polarization measurement .",
    "the rotation of the polarization reference axis from their design directions was measured to be less then @xmath102 during ground testing .",
    "the effect of the coupling to the stokes v component is a reduction in the sensitivity to the stokes q and u components , presuming no stokes v signal is present on the sky .",
    "the largest cross polar response is in w - band ( -22  db ) , corresponding to , at most , a 0.6% reduction in polarization sensitivity relative to the temperature calibration . at the levels indicated , neither of these effects alter the polarization measurements significantly .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the beams of the v2 da are used to illustrate the salient aspects of the beam analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2profile ] shows the beam profile for year-1 and the three years combined .",
    "it also shows the accumulated solid angle as a function of angle from the main beam axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2beamxform ] shows the window function derived from the profile .",
    "a number of features are evident .",
    "1 ) the profile is stable and is the same between years .",
    "2 ) there are contributions to the solid angle at the -20  dbi level ( the forward gain is 55  dbi ) , near the noise floor of the measurement .",
    "3 ) the new beam transforms are slightly different from the old ones .",
    "the beams are modeled using a code based on the dadra ( diffraction analysis of a dual reflector antenna ) physical optics routines @xcite .",
    "the deviations from an ideal beam shape can be explained as deformations of the reflectors .",
    "the shape of the primary is parametrized with a set of 122 fourier modes on a rectangular grid and the shape of the secondary with 30 modes . based on pre - flight measurements of the cold optics ,",
    "the surface correlation length is @xmath103  cm , which is just resolved by our basis functions .",
    "a conjugate - gradient least squares method is used to solve for the shape of the primary and secondary reflectors .",
    "the parameters of the fit are the amplitudes of the modes .",
    "the model simultaneously solves for all ten beam profiles and takes into account the measured passbands . for simplicity",
    "we average over polarizations .",
    "though the input can be thought of as 10 jupiter maps with @xmath104 net pixels , the fitting is done in the time ordered data to obviate complications associated with map pixelization .",
    "the actual fit is a multistep process . at first",
    "just a few modes on the primary are considered .",
    "after an approximate solution is found , more modes on the primary are added , and finally the modes on the secondary are added . the solution is annealed and the resolution of the model is adjusted as the fitting progresses .",
    "so far , we have only run the model on the a side .",
    "the fit method works because of the wide range of frequencies , the high signal to noise ratio , the angular resolution of the measurement , and the large sampling of the focal plane .",
    "related methods generally employ some sort of sampling of the phase of the wave front e.g. , out of focus ( oof ) holography @xcite which of course can not be done with _",
    "wmap_.    the residuals of the model",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : modelresid ] .",
    "these should be compared to figure  3 of @xcite which shows an earlier version of the model for the a side . for the best fit , the reduced @xmath105 ( with roughly @xmath104 pixels ) .",
    "in other words , the model fits to near the noise of the measurement with just 152 parameters .",
    "one measure of the accuracy of the model comes from the comparison between the modeled and the measured beam solid angle as shown in table  [ tab : beams ] . excluding w2 , the deviation is 1.6% ;",
    "the w2 solid angle is predicted to be 4.8% smaller than is measured .",
    "this gives us confidence that we understand the beams .",
    "however , as can be seen in the figure , there are small residual features that the model does not capture .",
    "these features occur mostly in the steep parts of the profiles corresponding to the deformations with the greatest length scales . nevertheless , the model is successful at unveiling faint large scale components of the beam .",
    "for example , a -26  db q - band lobe located @xmath106 below q2 was predicted by the model before it was found in the data .",
    "the model s effectiveness lies in the fact that it uses measurements with a high signal - to - noise ratio at all frequencies to find the shape of the reflector and thereby predict the beam shape many beamwidths off the beam axis at the noise floor of the measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2profile ] shows a comparison between the measured and modeled beam .",
    "the model captures the main features of the beam though there are some discrepancies at the -20 db level .",
    "most importantly , the model reveals that the beam profile continues to drop with increasing radius .",
    "this is simply a result of the @xmath107 correlation length of the surface deformations . with the new model",
    "there is no longer a need to impose a cutoff radius as was done in @xcite .",
    "the window functions are computed from the symmetrized beam profiles following the hermite method in @xcite , although the method is modified to take advantage of the modeling . the range of spacecraft orientations corresponding to the observational data contained in each sky map pixel depends on the ecliptic latitude of the pixel . for pixels near the ecliptic poles",
    "the observations occur nearly uniformly for all rotations of the spacecraft around each beam line - of - sight , effectively symmetrizing the beam . at lower ecliptic latitude",
    "the range of rotations is reduced .",
    "the use of the symmetrized beam profile approximation is therefore very good near the ecliptic poles , but worsens at lower ecliptic latitude .",
    "the least symmetrization occurs in the ecliptic plane . for beams in the ecliptic plane window function errors arising from use of the symmetrized beam approximation",
    "are less than 1% for @xmath108 in v - band and w - band . in q - band",
    "the errors are somewhat larger due to the larger beam ellipticities , with window functions error less than @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "the uncertainties in the window function determinations arising from incomplete beam symmetrization are included in the final window function uncertainties .",
    "more details regarding beam symmetrization can be found in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2profile ] shows one such fit for the symmetrized radial profile of the v2 a - side beam with a hermite expansion of order 170 . to remove some of the sensitivity of the window functions to the noise tail ,",
    "hybrid beams are constructed .",
    "the hybrid method retains the high signal to noise observations of the main beam and replaces the measurement with the model in regions of low signal . for the a side ,",
    "the hybrid beams are constructed by ( a ) scaling the model to measured peak height , ( b ) choosing a threshold level , @xmath111 ( table  [ tab : beams ] ) , and ( c ) using the measurement above @xmath111 and the scaled model below it .",
    "the hybridization is done with the full two dimensional profile in the tod before the symmetrization . since a complete model of the b side",
    "does not yet exist , the a - side profile is translated and rotated to the b side focal plane , scaled to the peak of the b - side data , and interpolated to replace b side observations in the tod when they are less than @xmath111 . for both a and b sides the hermite",
    "fits of order @xmath112 are made to the symmetrized beam profiles .",

    "this approximation can lead to biased gain measurements since it ignores the component of the tod arising from sidelobe pickup of the sky signal .",
    "this effect has been studied through simulations in which simulated tod , based on the sidelobe response maps , is input to the hourly gain fitting algorithm to determine the level of bias originating from the sidelobe signals .",

    "one approximation was used in the evaluation of these matrices to speed processing . recall that each observation populates two rows of the mapping matrix , each row corresponding the projection factors for each of the two radiometers comprising the da . within each row the 8 non - zero elements",
    "correspond to the two differential pixels ( a - side and b - side ) of the 4 maps i , q , u and s. the approximation consists of grouping time contiguous observations for which both the a - side beam and b - side beam remain in the same r4 pixels .",
    "each such group comprises @xmath229 rows of the mapping matrix ( about 15 observations ) whose non - zero elements reside in the same 8 columns . for each contiguous group of observations ,",
    "the averages of each of the columns containing non - zero values is calculated for the rows associated with each radiometer .",
    "these averages are tagged with the group s starting and ending times , the pixel indices of the a - side and b - side beams and the radiometer identification . given the starting and stopping times it is possible to calculate the appropriately weighted sum of @xmath230 corresponding to any pair of groups and corresponding radiometer .",
    "the sums over @xmath226 and @xmath227 are then calculated for all pairs of groups for which the weighted sum of @xmath230 is non - zero .",
    "this is accomplished by multiplying this weighted sum by the average values of the appropriate columns of the corresponding groups , and accumulating the values into pixel - pixel noise matrix elements based on the pixel indices associated with each group .",
    "the result is a @xmath231 matrix , @xmath203 , which may be inverted by standard numerical techniques to form the noise matrix @xmath206 . using the group average values for the data in the columns of @xmath138 rather than",
    "the exact row by row values in calculation of the inverse noise matrix is a good approximation for the vast majority of the sky , since the values being averaged are smooth and slowly varying .",
    "however these assumptions fail for pixels very close to the galactic poles since the polarizations angles @xmath153 and @xmath174 vary significantly _ within _ a r4 pixel . the effect of these approximations has been investigated and is found to have negligible affect on the calculated power spectra .",
    "the r4 noise matrices contained in the data release are calculated from mapping matrices corresponding to cut sky coverage and are intended for use in regions outside of the region excluded by the processing mask .",
    "values corresponding to r4 pixels entirely contained within the processing mask are set to zero .",
    "one potential source of systematic artifacts in the sky maps arises from the error in the determination of the input transmission imbalance parameters , @xmath72 .",
    "these parameters are measured from the flight data and are used to calculate the estimated dipole signal that is removed from the tod in preparation for the conjugate gradient map processing . due to the large amplitude of the dipole signal ,",
    "even small errors in the measured values of transmission imbalance parameters could introduce significant artifacts into the sky maps .",
    "this effect was studied through the use of simulations in which a simulated tod archive was produced with a given set of @xmath72 values and was analyzed with the input value of @xmath72 as well as values @xmath232 higher and lower to simulate errors in the measurement of @xmath72 . differences between the maps produced using the correct and incorrect @xmath72 displayed well defined spatial structure confined to low @xmath126 with small variations between das arising from the slightly different scan patterns .",
    "the geometry of these structures is completely determined by the scan patterns , while their amplitude in the final sky maps is determined by the difference between the @xmath72 value used to process the tod and the `` true '' value of @xmath72 .",
    "the patterns from these simulation are therefore treated as templates , used to exclude the modes corresponding to the aforementioned spatial structures from subsequent analysis .",
    "this is accomplished through the use of modified versions of the inverse noise matrices , @xmath233 , that have these modes projected out .",
    "each modified matrix is calculated as @xmath234 so that @xmath235 in the above expressions @xmath236 designates an outer - product and @xmath237 is the map mode to be removed , obtained from differences between the simulated maps made with the correct transmission imbalance factors and the incorrect factors .",
    "using these forms of the matrices in the spectral analysis @xcite eliminates artifacts which might result from the errant signals cause by errors in the measured values of the transmission imbalance parameters .",

    "since the matrices are produced at r4 due to computational constraints , corresponding low resolution sky maps must be produced that preserve the signal and noise properties as well as possible .",
    "there are several difficulties involved with production of low resolution maps . simply binning maps to lower resolution",
    ", using either uniform or pixel - by - pixel ( diagonal ) inverse noise weighting will result in aliasing of high-@xmath126 signal and noise into lower-@xmath126 modes .",
    "this effect can be reduced by applying a low - pass filter to the map before degradation , but such a filter introduces additional noise correlations , not described by the inverse noise matrix as described in the previous section . even without application of a filter , the omission of the inter - pixel noise correlations results in the degraded maps having noise properties not precisely described by the noise matrix as calculated in   [ sec : inverse_pp_noise_matrix ] .",
    "it is possible to produce low resolution sky maps directly using the procedures described in ",

    "such maps will have noise properties accurately described by the pixel - pixel noise matrix , but will have a _ higher _ degree of signal aliasing than maps initially produced at high resolution and subsequently degraded .",
    "this occurs since in evaluation of the sky map ( see eq.[[eqn : map_soln ] ] ) the low resolution form of the mapping matrix is applied to the data multiple times , each time introducing aliased signal components , whereas degrading a map initially produced at high resolution only introduces the aliased components once .    for the stokes i maps , which are highly signal dominated , degraded res 9 maps",
    "are clearly preferable , since the small errors in the noise description are of no consequence and these maps contain lower levels of aliased signal . for the stokes q and",
    "u maps the signal to noise ratio in the low-@xmath126 regime is on order unity .",
    "low resolution maps of stokes q and u were produced both directly at r4 and by degrading r9 maps without application of an anti - alias filter .",
    "analysis of both sets of maps produced very similar low-@xmath126 polarization results for both simulated and flight data . based on these results",
    "it was determined that the noise properties of the degraded form of low resolution polarization maps was adequately described by the pixel noise matrices , so the degraded form is used for all three stokes parameters .",
    "although the inter - pixel noise correlations are ignored in the map degradation , the noise correlations between the stokes q and u signals _ within _ each high resolution pixel are included .",
    "two different versions of reduced resolution maps are produced and are described in the following sections .",
    "[ sec : red_res_maps ] the full sky reduced resolution maps ( r4 ) are comprised of two components . the first component , which excludes the galactic plane region , is obtained by degrading the r9 cut sky ( spm ) maps and has noise properties described by the inverse noise matrices (  [ sec : inverse_pp_noise_matrix ] )",
    ". the second component , used in the galactic plane region , results from the degradation of the combined maps (  [ sec : combined_maps ] ) and has noise that is _ not _ described by the inverse noise matrices .",

    "the foreground cleaned q and u maps were degraded in a similar fashion to the full sky maps described above : for each high resolution pixel , @xmath247 , an @xmath248 matrix is formed ,    @xmath256    the values of the low resolution map pixels , @xmath250 , are the inverse noise weighted sum of the values of all the constituent high resolution pixels , @xmath257 in this case @xmath252 is the r9 @xmath258 mask  @xcite containing values of @xmath253 and @xmath254 and @xmath259 is a low resolution form of this mask which contains zeros in elements for which more than half of the r9 pixels were masked and values of unity otherwise .",

    "such artifacts do not integrate to lower levels with the inclusion of additional data as does random noise .",
    "the most likely source of such driving signals is from varying insolation due to the observatory s motion driving temperature variations in the instrument hardware , voltage fluctuation on the spacecraft power bus , or coupling directly into the microwave optics .",
    "for all of these effects the errant signal is expected to be synchronous with the 129 s motion of the sun relative to the spacecraft . following the procedure used in the year-1 analysis  @xcite",
    "the radiometer output signals were binned in a spacecraft fixed coordinate system based on the azimuth of the sun about the spin axis of the spacecraft .",
    "when binned in such a manner any signal synchronous with the azimuthal position of the sun about  should be preserved while asynchronous signal components should average away .",
    "combinations of radiometer outputs corresponding to both temperature anisotropies , @xmath260 , and polarization signals , @xmath261 , were accumulated for the entire 3 year mission .",
    "the resultant signals were all found to be less that @xmath262 .",
    "we therefore believe that there is little contamination of the tod arising from spin synchronous solar effects and no corrections are applied to the tod for spin synchronous signals .",
    "one of the most fundamental tests of the  maps is the year - to - year consistency between maps .",
    "although such tests do not eliminate the possibility of processing or systematic errors that repeat year to year , they do test for spurious signals such as striping from radiometer @xmath263 noise and glitches .",
    "a comparison between the year-1 and 3-year processing of the first year data from the v2 da was presented in   [ sec : gain_model_quad ] and displayed a predominantly quadrupolar feature associated with the use of the improved radiometer gain model . since both maps used in that comparison were generated from the same tod , the white noise component largely canceled in the difference maps allowing this feature to be seen . in the case of year - to - year comparisons such white noise cancellations",
    "do not occur , so subtle effects may not be evident .",
    "nevertheless two sets of year - by - year difference maps are presented to demonstrate the year - to - year consistency , one based on k bands with the largest foreground signal , and one based on v - band with the smallest foreground signal .",
    "the top four panels in figure  [ fig : k1_v_i_diff_maps ] display the 3 year average and year by year differences of the k - band full sky maps .",
    "the 3-year combined map is dominated by galactic emission and also displays a number of point sources at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the high level of galactic emission makes k - band one of the more difficult bands to calibrate .",
    "while the year - by - year null maps are noise dominated some residual galactic plane signal is evident .",
    "this signal arises from small calibration errors of @xmath264 and is consistent with the stated calibration uncertainty of @xmath265 .",
    "also evident in these maps are some features of both signs at high latitude arising from known variable sources .",
    "the lower four panels in figure  [ fig : k1_v_i_diff_maps ] display the 3-year average and year - by - year difference of the v - band data . in this case galactic emission can be seen at low latitudes and cmb anisotropies at high latitude .",
    "the difference maps are again noise dominated with the spatially varying noise properties evident .",
    "the increased noise near the ecliptic plane is a consequence of the lower number of observations in these regions as determined by the scan strategy .",
    "simple power spectra of individual year - to - year null maps are dominated by the radiometer noise bias which grows as @xmath266 when plotted with the customary scaling , and are not useful for assessing year - to - year map consistency .",

    "this combination removes the true sky signals to the extent that the bandpasses and gains of each pair of maps are matched , while the use of the year - to - year cross spectrum eliminates the noise bias since the radiometer noise is uncorrelated year - to - year .",

    "the galactic foreground emission , predominantly synchrotron , is clearly evident .",
    "the year - by - year difference maps are again noise dominated .",
    "the spatially varying noise structure for the stokes q and u maps is more complicated than that of the stokes i maps due to the additional polarization projection factors ( e.g. @xmath268 ) and the noise covariance between the stoke q and stokes u maps of each da .",
    "the faint cross - like features near the ecliptic poles are regions with large weights , and therefore low statistical noise , as can be seen by comparing these null maps with the @xmath240 maps in figure  [ fig : pass2_nobs_maps ] .",
    "simple null tests , as displayed in figure  [ fig : null_ps ] for stokes i , are not useful in assessing year - to - year consistency of the polarization maps due to the much smaller level of the expected signals and more complicated noise properties of the polarization maps . detailed analysis of the polarization results , including null tests , is presented in @xcite .",
    "evaluation of the instrument noise level is an important aspect of many analyses involving the _ wmap _  sky maps . in principle",
    ", a single noise per observation parameter , @xmath239 , should be sufficient to characterize the noise level for each set of maps ( a set consisting of the i , q and u maps for a given year of data and da ) .",
    "such a characterization would require the use of full resolution pixel - pixel noise correlation matrices , describing the noise correlations between all combinations of pixel indices and stokes components . for r9 sky maps ,",
    "the size of such matrices precludes their use .",
    "however , it is possible to characterize the map noise levels using only the diagonal components of the noise correlation matrices , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 , provided the _ intra - pixel _ components of noise correlation matrix , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 (   [ sec : red_res_maps ] ) are included .",
    "this approximation uses different values of the noise per observation parameter for maps of the different stokes components , parameterizing the effects of the ignored , off diagonal components of the noise correlation matrices .",
    "the different values of these parameters for the different map components result from the differences between the frequency distributions of the intensity and polarization information in the tod , and the radiometers frequency dependent , i.e. 1/f , noise properties .",
    "the noise levels of the radiometers are also found to be stable year - to - year , so a single noise per observation value for each sky map / da combination describes all three individual year sky maps .",
    "the noise levels of the r9 maps in the current data release have been estimated using two different methods . in the first method",
    "the noise - per - observation , is calculated directly for each da from a weighted average of the variance of year to year differences of sky maps .",
    "for the i maps the noise per observations based on year @xmath213 and year @xmath269 sky maps , @xmath270 , is given as @xmath271 where @xmath272 and @xmath273 are the stokes i value and the number of observations for pixel @xmath274 of the year @xmath213 sky maps , and @xmath275 is the processing mask , used to exclude regions of high galactic emission from the analysis .",
    "extending this technique to the polarization maps requires a generalization to allow for the noise covariance between the stokes q and u maps and the spurious map , s. this is implemented using the relations @xmath276 where @xmath277 is a vector comprised of the differences between the year @xmath213 and year @xmath269 values of the q , u and s maps at pixel @xmath274 , and @xmath278 is the corresponding @xmath279 element matrix describing the intra - pixel noise correlations between the q , u and s maps for pixel @xmath274 and year @xmath213 .",

    "the product @xmath336 was evaluated by generating one year of simulated tod representing the sidelobe response to a predicted annual dipole signal .",
    "this tod was fitting in one hour periods to a template function corresponding to the expected pencil beam response signal .",
    "although the quantity @xmath335 is in principle time dependent , it was found to vary by less than 10% over the entire year simulation , and it is approximated as constant . applying this calibration factor to the uncalibrated data yields a calibrated archive , @xmath337    a sidelobe corrected archive , calibrated to correspond to the main beam containing _ all _ the antenna gain can be written as @xmath338 where the prefactor of the integral compensates for the fact that only the fraction @xmath321 of the beam response is contained in the main beam in @xmath339 . to first order in @xmath319",
    "this can be obtained from the uncorrected calibrated archive , @xmath340 where @xmath341 is an approximate sky map obtained from applying the iterative map making algorithm to the calibrated ( but not sidelobe corrected ) tod archive given by equation  [ eq : cal_tod ] .",
    "values of the recalibration factor , @xmath342 , are presented in table  [ tab : intensity_processing1 ] ."
