    "when ordered , classical spin systems can arrange in a number of patterns , including ( anti)ferromagnetic , canted , and helical structures .",
    "in addition to these , quantum mechanics allows the formation of a wealth of magnetic phases for quantum spins not available to their classical counterparts . due to its quantum numbers ,",
    "detection of such order is often difficult : for instance , nayak has considered a generalization of spin density wave ( sdw ) order , in which spin triplet particle - hole pairs of non - zero angular momentum condense with a modulated density@xcite .",
    "these states are characterized by spin currents rather than spin densities : thus , they do not couple at linear order to probes such as photons , neutrons , or nuclear spins . only at",
    "second order do these phases couple to conventional probes , e.g. in two - magnon raman scattering . despite the challenges involved in their detection , subtle forms of magnetic ordering such as",
    "these may be necessary to explain phenomena such as the specific heat anomaly in the heavy - fermion compound uru@xmath1si@xmath1@xcite , and the pseudogap regime in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "promising materials for the observation of exotic magnetic phases include systems with strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations such as the heavy - fermion compounds , the organic superconductors , and the cuprates .",
    "for instance , the cuprates in the absence of carrier doping are antiferromagnetic mott insulators at low temperatures .",
    "as carriers are introduced through doping , the nature of the magnetic order evolves until , for optimally doped and overdoped samples , the system becomes a metallic paramagnet . in between these two limits ,",
    "the underdoped cuprates have been argued to have spin glass@xcite and stripe phases@xcite .",
    "the proximity between mott insulator and superconducting phases in the cuprates makes them ideal systems to study the hierarchy by which the broken symmetry of mott insulators is restored  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will explore the possibility of detection of spin nematic order , a different quantum magnetic phase , in strongly correlated electron systems@xcite .",
    "nematic order has been proposed as a state originating from charge fluctuations of stripe order@xcite .",
    "a spin stripe is a unidirectional collinear spin density wave ( sdw ) , and it consists of antiferromagnetically ordered domains separated by anti - phase domain walls , across which the direction of the staggered magnetization flips sign .",
    "the order parameter is @xmath2 with @xmath3 corresponding to antiferromagnetically ordered stripes with period @xmath4 . here",
    ", the complex vector @xmath5 takes its value within the manifold of ground - states @xmath6 ; the @xmath7 quotient is necessary not to overcount physical configurations , as the transformation @xmath8 , @xmath9 does not modify @xmath10 .",
    "the real vector @xmath11 gives the direction of the staggered magnetization in the middle of a domain , while the phase factor @xmath12 specifies the location of the domain walls .",
    "a shift in @xmath13 by @xmath14 translates the system by the periodicity of the sdw , and thus leaves the system invariant .",
    "associated with collinear sdw order is charge order due to the modulations in the amplitude of the local spin magnetization@xcite , which can be described by a generalized cdw order parameter @xmath15 for some @xmath16 invariant observable @xmath17 , not necessarily the electron density . in the stripe picture ,",
    "this cdw usually arises from the accumulation of holes at the domain walls .",
    "stripes were first observed in elastic neutron scattering experiments on the spin-1 nickelate insulator la@xmath18sr@xmath19nio@xmath20 , and coexistence of stripes with superconductivity was first observed in underdoped @xcite , where the unidirectional character was demonstrated by transport@xcite and photoemission@xcite measurements . in and",
    ", it is observed that sdw order is first destroyed by spin fluctuations@xcite . in this case ,",
    "memory of the charge modulation can remain , even after averaging over the spin direction , resulting in a spin - invariant cdw phase , whose presence may explain recent stm measurements in @xcite .    for other materials , however , or in other regions of the phase diagram , symmetry may be restored in a different order . in particular , zaanen and",
    "nussinov  @xcite proposed that many experimental features of can be explained by assuming that the spin stripe order is destroyed by charge fluctuations . in this picture , dynamical oscillations in the anti - phase domain - walls of a spin stripe lead to a restoration of translational symmetry and a loss of nel order .",
    "however , although both charge and spin order seem to be destroyed in this process , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , full spin symmetry need not be restored : so long as neither dislocations nor topological excitations of the spin proliferate , the integrity of the domain walls allows the staggered magnetization on each oscillating domain to be well - defined .",
    "thus , although the local magnetization does not have an expectation value , the magnetization modulo an overall sign does .",
    "this is nematic order , in which @xmath23 and @xmath24 are identified , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nemfluct ] .",
    "the order parameter can be chosen to be @xmath25 , which has a non - zero expectation value . because translational invariance is restored in this process",
    ", the nematic order parameter is spatially uniform , instead of being modulated by some multiple of the sdw wave vector .",
    "in addition , we expect the nematic to be uniaxial , with a single preferred axis @xmath11 ( mod @xmath7 ) inherited from the nearby collinear sdw",
    ".    , width=302 ]    direct observation of spin nematic order through conventional probes is difficult .",
    "for instance , neutrons do not couple to nematic order , which is a spin - two operator .",
    "similarly , nematic order is translationally invariant , and does not give bragg peaks in x - ray experiments . in principle",
    ", two - magnon raman scattering can probe nematic order , but in practice it is difficult to separate the contribution due to the nematic from the creation of two magnons@xcite .",
    "hence , although spin nematic order can have important experimental consequences , e.g. for antiferromagnetic correlations in magnetic field experiments on superconducting samples @xcite , its direct detection remains a challenge .",
    "the existence of other stripe liquid phases , different from the spin nematic treated in this paper , as well as proposals for their detection , are discussed in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the nematic state described there originates from fluctuations of a unidirectional cdw that restore translational invariance but , by maintaining a memory of the original orientation of the cdw , break the rotational symmetry ( point group ) of the lattice . hence , unlike the spin nematic , this  charge nematic \" is su(2 ) spin invariant , and only breaks a discrete group .",
    "a spin nematic is a state that breaks spin su(2 ) symmetry without breaking time reversal invariance @xcite .",
    "the presence of spin nematic order can be observed in the equal time spin - spin correlator @xmath26 this expression corresponds to the su(2 ) decomposition @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the three terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ spindecomp ] ) in turn .",
    "the scalar function @xmath28 is explicitly spin invariant .",
    "it contains important information regarding charge order , but it does not help us in defining a nematic phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the pseudovector function @xmath29 gives a measure of the non - collinearity of the spin vector field .",
    "however , in the case at hand where the nematic state originates from charge fluctuations of a collinear sdw phase , we expect @xmath30 to vanish .",
    "this is supported by the fact that , from the point of view of the ginzburg - landau free energy , the pseudovector @xmath31 can not couple linearly to any function of the sdw order parameter @xmath32 as an aside , we note that for systems with spin exchange anisotropy of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) form , the dm vector will couple linearly to @xmath31 , as expected from the weak non - collinearity ( canting ) in such systems .",
    "however , the expectation value of @xmath30 in this case comes from explicit breaking of the spin symmetry .",
    "thus , all information of interest to us is contained in the symmetric spin-2 tensor @xmath33 .",
    "we define a symmetrized traceless spin correlator @xmath34 , @xmath35 whose expectation value yields @xmath33 directly , @xmath36 starting from a sdw state , as domain wall fluctuations grow to destroy charge order , translational invariance is restored to the system , insuring that @xmath37 is independent of the center - of - mass coordinate , _",
    "@xmath38 for any displacement @xmath39 .",
    "this fact alone signals the breaking of spin symmetry , since the choice of a non - trivial ( _ i.e. _ not proportional to @xmath40 ) tensor @xmath33 has been made across the system .",
    "thus , while @xmath37 decays exponentially with distance @xmath41 due to the absence of long - range nel order , the onset of nematic order is reflected in the translationally - invariant expectation value in the matrix - valued function ( [ link ] ) .",
    "since the original sdw state has a single preferred spin direction @xmath42 , the ensuing nematic order will be uniaxial , @xmath43 here , we have decomposed the order parameter into three component objects : a function @xmath44 describing the internal structure of the nematic ; the unit vector director field @xmath11 ; and the scalar magnitude @xmath45 . as seen explicitly from ( [ link ] ) ,",
    "the function @xmath44 is parity - symmetric , @xmath46 . as will be shown below , @xmath44 is dominated by the short range antiferromagnetic correlations between spins , and therefore has a large contribution at the wave vector @xmath47 . by definition ,",
    "we choose this contribution to be positive , @xmath48 . with this convention",
    ", @xmath49 corresponds to a nel vector that is locally aligned or anti - aligned with the director field @xmath11 ( sometimes referred to as the n@xmath50 phase in the literature of classical liquid crystals , see e.g. ref .  ) , while @xmath51 corresponds to a nel vector that is predominantly perpendicular to @xmath11 ( the n@xmath52 phase ) .",
    "we will show that , at low temperatures , @xmath49 due to the local antiferromagnetic correlations whereas , for anisotropic systems at high temperatures , a phase with @xmath51 is possible .",
    "finally , we note that the unidirectional sdw state ( stripe phase ) breaks the discrete rotational symmetry of a tetragonal lattice .",
    "this symmetry may be restored when charge fluctuations destroy the sdw state to form the nematic . in this chase @xmath53",
    "will be symmetric under rotations on the plane by @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "however , if a memory of the orientation of the stripes survives the domain wall fluctuations , @xmath44 will not have such symmetry , yielding a `` nematic spin - nematic '' , _",
    "i.e. _ a translationally invariant system that is anisotropic in real space and in spin space .",
    "sections  [ sec : wavefn ] and  [ sec : meanfield ] will be devoted to understanding the behavior of the three component fields of the nematic : @xmath44 , @xmath11 , and @xmath45 .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : detection ] we will explore how this detailed knowledge can be used in experimental searches for nematic order .",
    "in order to explore the possible symmetry properties of the function @xmath44 , we study its short wave length structure by explicit construction of a nematic operator on a small cluster . as is well known , it is impossible to describe nematic order in terms of a single spin-@xmath56 particle , as the identification of `` up '' and `` down '' results in a trivial hilbert space for the spin degree of freedom . another way to see",
    "this is that a spin-2 operator has a vanishing expectation value with respect to any spin-@xmath56 state , resulting in the identity @xmath57 whenever @xmath58    this limitation can be overcome by coarse - graining a group of spins and constructing a nematic wave function out of them . in order to preserve the underlying rotational symmetry of the system",
    ", we carry this out on square @xmath59 plaquettes of spins , and use energetic considerations to find the states most likely to contribute to magnetic order .",

    "@xcite or the core approach of altman and auerbach @xcite . in these analyses ,",
    "the lattice is first split into plaquettes . on each plaquette ,",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized , and the @xmath62 lowest energy states @xmath63 are kept , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 labels the plaquette . for a lattice composed of @xmath66 plaquettes , this allows one to define a projected subspace @xmath67 of the hilbert space spanned by @xmath68 factorizable states of the form @xmath69 .",
    "we assume that the ground state is well - contained in @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ spect ] reproduces results in @xcite for a @xmath60-@xmath61 model on a @xmath59 plaquette .",
    "the lowest energy bosonic states are , at half filling , the @xmath70 ground state @xmath71 and the @xmath72 magnon triplet @xmath73 , and for a plaquette with two holes , an @xmath70 state @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , there are two low - lying @xmath75 fermion doublets with one hole ; however , unbound holes are dynamically suppressed , as supported by dmrg calculations on larger lattices , and we shall exclude the one - hole sector in what follows . then , to lowest order in the analysis , we only keep the low - lying bosonic states , in terms of which a general low - energy plaquette state can be written as @xmath76    -@xmath61 model on a @xmath77 plaquette . adapted from @xcite .",
    "[ spect],width=302 ]    it is useful to get some intuition regarding the wave functions ( [ lowplaq ] ) . introducing the total spin and staggered spin operators on a plaquette , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as well as the dm - type vector , @xmath80 , we find @xmath81 up to positive multiplicative factors and up to terms lying outside of the projected low - energy space .",
    "in particular , we find the expectation values on a single plaquette @xmath82 the last two expressions describe local singlet and triplet superconductivity , respectively .",
    "one can build a nematic on a cluster of plaquettes by choosing a factorizable state , in which @xmath83 and @xmath84 is a constant real vector on every plaquette , @xmath85 the constraint that @xmath84 is real insures that no long range ferromagnetic or nel orders develop , whereas nematic order does due to the su(2)-symmetry breaking choice of the vector @xmath84 . note from ( [ expect ] ) that @xmath86 is also a triplet superconducting state ( except at half - filling , where @xmath87 ) .",
    "order of this type is found , for instance , in the triplet superconducting state of quasi - one dimensional bechgaard salts , where the triplet superconducting order parameter is constant along the fermi surface due to the splitting of the fermi surface into two disjoint fermi sheets@xcite .    on the other hand , in applications to materials such as the high @xmath88 cuprates",
    ", we would like to introduce a nematic state that is a singlet superconductor , instead of triplet .",
    "for this , the use of non - factorizable states is necessary .",

    "if the angle @xmath92 were held constant across the lattice , long range sdw order would ensue .",
    "in contrast , by integrating independently over the @xmath92 at different sites , we introduce charge fluctuations that average out the local magnetization to zero .",
    "hence , the state ( [ nonfact ] ) has restored translational and time - reversal symmetry , with only singlet superconductivity and nematic order surviving .",
    "we note that ( [ nonfact ] ) ignores correlations between spin degrees of freedom , controlled by @xmath93 , and charge degrees of freedom , controlled by @xmath94 .",
    "more complex nematic wave functions that take this effect into account are given in appendix  [ app : spincharge ] .",
    "on the other hand , in practical calculations , one may consider a slightly simpler wave function than ( [ nonfact ] ) by replacing the @xmath92 by local ising variables @xmath95 on each plaquette .",

    "finally , note that in order to produce a nematic state without any type of superconductivity ( singlet or triplet ) , it is necessary to introduce _ another _ fluctuating ising variable which multiplies the term @xmath97 in ( [ nonfact2 ] ) , thus randomizing the relative phase between all three components of the wave function .",
    "despite the fact that we have considered many different wave functions , depending on the possible coexistence of nematic order with different types of superconductivity , the analysis above allows us to make strong predictions on the dominant short wave length dependence of @xmath44 .",
    "this is because , of all the low energy plaquette states kept in the projected hilbert space , only the triplet @xmath73 breaks su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "hence , only this state can contribute directly to the nematic order parameter .",
