    "we proved a variational existence proof of a periodic orbit in the _ octahedral six - body problem _ with equal masses .",
    "next we explain the main ideas on the prove .",
    "let us consider six bodies with equal masses in @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that every coordinate axis contains a couple of bodies , and they are symmetric with respect to the origin , that is the center of mass of the system .",
    "this is the octahedral six - body problem .",
    "our orbit starts with a collision in the @xmath3axis and the other @xmath4 bodies form a square on the ortogonal plane .",
    "let us denote by @xmath5 the period of the solution . during the _",
    "first sixth _ of the period , the bodies on the @xmath3axis move away , the two bodies on the @xmath6axis also move away , while the bodies on @xmath7axis approach . at time",
    "@xmath8 the bodies on the @xmath6axis are point and they approach each other as @xmath9 $ ] . at time",
    "@xmath10 the bodies on @xmath7axis are at a double collision , and the other bodies form a square on the orthogonal plane . in the second third of the period ,",
    "the motion is the same as above , after having exchanged @xmath11 by @xmath12 , @xmath12 by @xmath13 and @xmath13 by @xmath11 . that is to say the solution satisfies the symmetry condition @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "see figure @xmath17    in section 2 we will introduce the formal aspects of the problem , we will write the equations of motion and explain the variational setting .",
    "in particular , we will prove that the lagrangian action functional is _",
    "coercive_. in section 3 we show that a minimizer has no other collisions besides those imposed by the choice of set of loops where we minimize the action funcional , and that all collisions are double ( _ i.e. _ there are no quadruple collision ) . in section 4",
    "we regularize all possible collisions .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the main theorem , which is proved in section 4 .",
    "notice that if at a certain instant the configuration of the bodies is octahedral ( and the velocities too ) , the configuration is octahedral for all time . to describe the octahedral six - body problem with equal masses",

    "we can identify the configuration space @xmath26 with @xmath2 , and every configuration with a vector @xmath27 .    without loss of generality we can normalize the masses , @xmath28 .",
    "so the kinetic energy and potential function assume the form : @xmath29 @xmath30    a configuration is said to be a collision if at least two bodies occupy the same position in space .",
    "due to the symmetry of the configuration , when this happens , one of the three cartesian coordinate is equal to zero .",

    "quadruple collision _ if only two of the three cartesian coordinates are equal to zero , and it is said to be a total collision if @xmath34 .",

    "we will prove in section @xmath37 that there is no quadruple and total collision . in section 4",
    "we will show that for an action minimizer the double collisions are regularize .",
