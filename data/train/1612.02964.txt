    "this equidistribution has two interesting applications :    * the calculation of the double eulerian distribution @xmath92 on @xmath93 ; * an interpretation of the @xmath39-coefficients of @xmath62 in terms of @xmath0-avoiding inversion sequences via the _ foata  strehl group action _  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
