    "one of the most fundamental challenges in all forms of omic technologies is the connection of biological event signatures with others previously derived to allow the recognition of new molecule properties or biological alteration .",
    "simple , robust , and efficient matching methods are required to connect a new gene signature with those in a database .",
    "this problem was first tackled by lamb et al @xcite who introduced the connectivity map as a resource and tool to connect small - molecule drugs , genes , and diseases .",
    "lamb et al s connectivity map achieved a good degree of success , but also suffered from several deficiencies , particularly an inability to apply a measure of statistical validity at the individual reference signature level to allow rational filtering of the results to exclude false connections .",
    "we took the method of lamb as a basis for development and have derived a simple , robust and statistically testable method for making connections between biological event signatures .",
    "the method was tested with genomic signatures resulting from small molecule interactions in cells , but also could be applied to any form of signature such as those from proteomic or metabolomic science .",
    "the main assumption behind the concept of connectivity map is that a biological state , whether physiological , pathological , or induced with chemical or genomic perturbations , can be described in terms of a genomic signature , eg . , the genome - wide mrna levels as measured by dna microarray technologies . the working of the connectivity map involves several key components . first , a large collection of pre - built reference gene - expression profiles serve as the core database , where each reference profile characterizes a well - defined biological state",
    "secondly , a query gene signature from some specific studies .",
    "a query gene signature is basically a short ( as compared to the list of genes in a typical reference profile ) list of genes most relevant and important to characterize the biological state of the researchers interest . finally , a pattern matching algorithm or similarity metric defined between a query gene signature and a reference gene - expression profile to quantify the closeness or connection between the two biological states",
    ". the connectivity map could be used by biomedical researchers to find connections between the reference biological states and those of their own interest .",
    "this may lead to new findings of unexpected connections and testable new biological hypotheses . in this paper",
    ", we present a new framework for the construction of reference profiles and new connection scoring scheme and testing procedures for the observed connections . we compare our method with that of lamb et al , and show that more robust results are achieved using our method .",
    "in particular our method not only offers more principled statistical procedures for testing connections , but more importantly it provides effective safeguard against false connections while at the same time achieves much increased sensitivity . as a consequence it can benefit the end users by saving them enormous amount of time and resources in pursuing new biological hypotheses based on the findings of connectivity maps .",
    "for the first - generation connectivity map , lamb et al carried out a series of gene - expression profiling experiments @xcite , using @xmath0 distinct small - molecule compounds in a few selected human cell lines .",
    "each treatment instance consisted of one treatment sample and one ( or more ) vehicle control samples , whose genome wide mrna levels were measured using affymetrix genechip microarrays . in total @xmath1 samples",
    "were microarrayed , which represented @xmath2 different treatment instances .",
    "for example , treatment instance id988 consisted of 1 treatment sample and 6 vehicle control samples .",
    "the treatment sample was obtained by treating human mcf7 cells with @xmath3 estradiol for 6 hours .",
    "the control samples were obtained by treating mcf7 cells with vehicle control for 6 hours .",
    "a gene - expression profile was constructed for each treatment instance , in which the relative expression ( treatment relative to the control ) of all measured genes were specified , and sorted in descending order . a query gene signature , obtained and ordered in the same manner , can be compared to each reference profile in the connectivity map to calculate a connectivity score .",
    "for `` _ positive connectivity _ '' , the up - regulated genes of the query signature find matches near the top of the reference profile , and the down - regulated genes find matches near the bottom of the reference profile .",
    "for `` _ negative connectivity _ '' , the matches are opposite .",
    "we obtained lamb et al s data set ( accession number gse5258 ) from the geo ( gene expression omnibus ) database , and rebuilt @xmath2 reference gene - expression profiles using a new ranking scheme based on the following guiding principles : ( 1 ) a treatment instance was defined relative to a control , thus the effect of the treatment could be characterized by the relative differential expression status of all the genes together , ( 2 ) different genes were affected to different extents by the treatment , so genes which showed a greater differential expression should have more weight in characterizing this treatment , and ( 3 ) up- and down - regulated genes should be treated equally in a unified manner .",
    "this meant that a 2-fold down - regulated gene was considered as equally important as a 2-fold up - regulated gene in defining a reference profile .",
    "there are several reasons for the choice of treating up- and down - regulated genes equally . theoretically , unless we have a lot of further information about so many genes on the microarray it is difficult to decide whether this 2-fold up - regulated gene is more important than that 2-fold down - regulated gene or the opposite .",
    "so a logical choice is to assign them equal weights .",
    "another reason is the consideration of symmetry : if a gene is 2-fold up - regulated in sample 1 versus sample 2 , it can also be viewed as 2-fold down - regulated in sample 2 versus sample 1 .",
    "we should emphasize that assigning two genes equal weights does not imply in any sense they share the same molecular mechanism .",
    "even two up - regulated genes with the same fold changes could have very different molecular mechanisms as to why they increased their expression . to adhere to the above guidelines , an obvious choice for organizing the genes is the logarithm of the expression ratio ( treatment over control ) .",
    "thus instead of treating the down- and up - regulated genes separately as in the methods of lamb et al , we ordered genes in a reference profile by the absolute value of their expression log - ratios .",
    "therefore the most differentially expressed genes ( either up or down ) appear first in the list , and those non - differentially expressed genes appear at the bottom of the list . in this way ,",
    "the genes are ordered by their importance in defining the reference profile .",
    "it is then straightforward to assign ranks to them .",
    "suppose there are in total @xmath4 genes , the first gene in the list will be assigned a rank @xmath4 if it is up - regulated , or a rank @xmath5 if it is down - regulated .",
    "in general the @xmath6th gene in the list will be ranked with @xmath7 for up - regulation or @xmath8 for down - regulation . with this new ranking method , the importance of a gene is reflected by the absolute value of its rank , while the sign of its rank indicates its regulation status .",
    "the consequence and advantage of this method for creating reference profiles is that attaching statistical significance to the connection observed is a relatively straightforward step .",
    "a query gene signature can be an ordered gene list , or just a collection of genes without specific ordering among them .",
    "we will refer to these two types of query gene signatures as _ ordered _ and _ unordered _ gene signature respectively . for an ordered gene signature",
    ", we rank the genes in the list in the same way as for a reference profile .",
    "namely , the most important ( differentially expressed ) gene in the signature will be assigned a rank @xmath9 or @xmath10 depending on its regulation status , where @xmath9 is the number of genes in the signature . while the least important gene in the signature be ranked @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote a reference gene - expression profile , and @xmath14 a query gene signature .",
    "we define the _ connection strength _ between @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the @xmath6th gene in the signature , @xmath17 is its signed rank in the signature , and @xmath18 is this gene s signed rank in the reference profile .",
    "it is worth noting some properties of the connection strength defined above : ( 1 ) if a gene has the same regulation status ( either up- or down - regulation ) in both the reference and the query , it will make a positive contribution to the connection strength , otherwise its contribution will be negative ; ( 2 ) the magnitude of a gene s contribution to the connection strength is determined by its position in both lists ; and ( 3 ) a gene signature with some of its genes contributing positively and others negatively will have an overall low connection strength , because the positive and negative contributions cancel each other to some extent . therefore calculating the connection strength between a gene signature and a reference profile , the maximum connection strength achievable is the situation where the @xmath9 genes in the signature match the first @xmath9 genes in the reference profile in the correct order , and their regulation status also match .",
    "in such a case , the maximum positive connection strength is , for an _ ordered _ gene signature , @xmath19 in another equally interesting situation , where the @xmath9 genes in the signature match the first @xmath9 genes in the reference profile in the right order , but the sign of each gene in the query is different from its sign in the reference , the connection strength is @xmath20 , the opposite of eq.([eq - c_max - ordered ] ) .    for an unordered query signature ,",
    "all the genes in the list have equal weight because there is no particular ordering among them .",
    "the calculation of connection strength is the same as eq.([eq - c(r , s ) ] ) , the only difference being that @xmath21 if gene @xmath16 is up - regulated , or @xmath22 if it is down - regulated .",
    "consequently , the maximum magnitude of connection strength for an _ unordered _ signature is @xmath23    given a query signature gene and a reference gene - expression profile , we can calculate their connection score by @xmath24 so a connection score @xmath25 means that the gene signature has the maximum positive connection strength with the reference profile , which indicates that the experimental condition that gave rise to this gene signature had the strongest possible correlation with the treatment instance that generated the reference profile .",
    "a connection score @xmath26 indicates that the two experimental perturbations were most inversely correlated . in general",
    ", a connection score @xmath27 will be within the range of @xmath28 .",
    "as for most biomedical experiments with unavoidable biological and technical variation , statistical significance is a crucial aid to the interpretation and subsequent validation of the result .",
    "here we propose calculating the p - value associated with a connection score by testing the following null hypothesis .",
    "* null hypothesis @xmath29 : * for a reference gene - expression profile @xmath13 and a query gene signature @xmath14 , the null hypothesis @xmath29 states that there is no underlying biological connection between the two , and that the query signature @xmath14 is merely a random @xmath9-gene signature , as generated by procedure 1 described below .",
    "* procedure 1 : * generation of a random @xmath9-gene signature .",
    "let @xmath13 be a given reference gene - expression profile of @xmath4 genes .",
    "select @xmath9 genes sequentially and randomly from the @xmath4 genes ( without replacement ) , and assign @xmath30 ( up - regulation ) or @xmath12 ( down - regulation ) randomly with equal probability to each of the @xmath9 selected genes .",
    "if this gene signature is to be used as an ordered list , its order is just the order in which the @xmath9 genes are selected ; or if this gene signature is to be used as merely a collection of genes , then order is irrelevant .    given a reference profile @xmath13 and a gene signature @xmath14 , we calculate their connection score @xmath27 by eq.([eq - c ] ) , and the two - tailed p - value associated with this observed connection score is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the connection score between a random gene signature and the reference profile . to estimate the p - value , a large number ( eg . , @xmath33 ) of random connection scores can be generated using procedure 1 and eq.([eq - c ] ) , the proportion of random scores that are no less than the observed scores @xmath27 in absolute value is an estimate of the two - tailed p - value .",
    "the @xmath2 individual treatment instances of the data set gse5258 were created using only @xmath0 distinct small - molecule compounds .",
    "some treatment instances were replication experiments using the same compound at the same or different doses .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider all the treatment instances of the same compound as a set , and to assess the overall connection of the set with a query gene signature .",
    "we define the connection score for a treatment set as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of individual treatment instances belonging to the treatment set , @xmath36 is the connection score of the @xmath6th instance . to test the significance of a treatment set as a whole .",
    "we used the following null hypothesis ,    * null hypothesis @xmath37 : * where @xmath38 denotes a set of treatment instances , @xmath39 the reference profile based on treatment instance @xmath6 , and @xmath14 a query gene signature , the null hypothesis @xmath37 states that there is no underlying biological connection between the gene signature @xmath14 and any of the reference profiles in t. the query signature is merely a random gene list generated by procedure 1 .",
    "thus the null hypothesis @xmath40 is an extension of @xmath29 to a higher level .",
    "alternatively , @xmath29 can be viewed as a special case of @xmath37 , in which there is only one treatment instance in the treatment set .",
    "once the connection score for a set is observed , its associated p value can be estimated in a similar way : a large number of random gene signatures are generated using procedure 1 , and the connection score of the set to each of the random gene signatures is calculated using eq.([eq - setcscore ] ) ; the proportion of random connection scores that are greater than the observed score in absolute value is an estimation of the p value .",
    ".[tab - rds01-lamb ] the connectivity scores of the random gene signature rds01 to the reference profiles in the lamb connectivity map . [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the treatment set level , lamb et al s connectivity map provides a permutation p value when a set of treatment instances associated with the same compound were viewed as a whole .",
    "the permutation p value was calculated by comparing a statistic ( again based on k - s statistic ) of the treatment set with the distribution of many random - set statistics .",
    "those random sets were formed by randomly selecting treatment instances from all instances . from the way the permutation p value was calculated",
    ", it was clear that the following null hypothesis was being tested : _ the set of instances in question have the same pattern ( distribution ) of connections with the query gene signature compared with a randomly formed set of the same size . _ a null hypothesis such as this is not the most appropriate one to test , because it is not directly relevant to the question of whether the query gene signature had any real biological connection to the treatment set .",
    "lamb et al themselves also recognized that more rigorous methods for the estimation of statistical significance were probably required@xcite .",
    "putting its appropriateness aside , if we do use the permutation p values from lamb et al s connectivity map to control false connections , the same criteria for setting threshold p value can be used .",
    "the results of significance analysis on the connections between the two random gene signatures and the @xmath0 treatments sets can be found in the supplementary data . in this instance",
    "both connectivity maps gave the right answers for these two random gene signatures .",
    "however , for lamb et al s connectivity map permutation p values were not available for all the @xmath0 treatment sets . for those treatment sets which only contain @xmath11 treatment instance or those sets with mean connectivity score @xmath41 , no permutation p values could be calculated , and hence no statistical significance .",
    "this problem affects the coverage and consequently the sensitivity of lamb et al s connectivity map , because real biological connections between a query gene signature and any of those treatment sets may not be recognized .",
    "compounds are identified as significant solely by a and b ( not c ) , `` b 4 '' means that @xmath42 compounds are identified as significant solely by b ( not a , not c ) , and so on . the areas are approximately proportional to the numbers they represent.,width=321 ]      to test the ability of the new method for identifying real biological connections we utilized some of the same examples used in @xcite to compare with lamb et al s connectivity map .",
    "the first example was a gene signature of histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitors ( lamb s gene signature sigs01 ) , which was compiled from @xcite on the responses of t24 , mda435 and mda468 cells respectively to three histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitors : vorinostat , ms-27 - 275 , and trichostatin a. this gene signature consisted of 8 up- and 5 down - regulated genes , represented by @xmath43 affymetrix probe - set ids on the affymetrix hg - u133a microarrays .",
    "as lamb et al s connectivity map does not provide any safeguard on individual treatment instance level against possible false connections , we can only use the results of lamb et al s connectivity map on the treatment set level . in total 6 compounds ( vorinostat , trichostatin a",
    ", resveratrol , geldanamycin , valproic acid , and 17aag ) were identified to have significant positive connectivity with the hdac inhibitor gene signature ; and 2 compounds ( 5182598 and fludrocortisone ) had significant negative connectivity .",
    "vorinostat , trichostatin a , and valproic acid are known hdac inhibitors thus the identification of these can be regarded as a success . however another known hdac inhibitor hc - toxin , a reference profile of which was contained in the database , was not identified .",
    "this happened because there was only one treatment instance of the compound hc - toxin in the database and so no permutation p value could be obtained using lamb et al s method .",
    "based on their instance level results , lamb et al highlighted hc - toxin in @xcite as it had the 7th highest connectivity score ( 0.914 ) of all instances in the dataset .",
    "however , as the two examples of random gene signatures showed lamb et al s instance level analysis gave false connections even for the highest connectivity scores 1.0 .",
    "so the rational choice is to disregard the instance level results from lamb et al s connectivity map .",
    "we used this same hdac inhibitor gene signature to query the new connectivity map presented here , with p values calculated at both the individual instance level and the treatment set level .",
    "@xmath44 treatment instances , representing @xmath45 distinct compounds , were found to have significant connections to sigs01 . on the treatment set level @xmath46 compounds were found to have significant connections with the signature . near the top of the significant connection list were those known hdac inhibitors highlighted in @xcite .",
    "importantly though also included in the output was hc - toxin , which was not identified by the set - level analysis lamb et al s connectivity map .",
    "the full results of querying both connectivity maps using the hdac inhibitor gene signature are included in the supplementary data . in fig .",
    "[ fig - hdac ] , we summarize the number of significant connections as identified by : ( a ) instance level analysis using the new method presented here ; ( b ) set level analysis using the new method ; ( c ) set level analysis using lamb et al s connectivity map . in total , our method ( a ) and ( b ) combined identified 27 compounds and lamb et al s connectivity map identified 8 compounds , as having significant connections to the hdac inhibitors .",
    "our method missed only 1 of the 8 compounds found significant by lamb et al s connectivity map , while the latter missed 20 of the 27 compounds identified by our method , with hc - toxin among the 20 compounds that were missed .",
    "the hdac inhibitors example thus shows that our new method is more sensitive at detecting real connections . with the increased sensitivity and false connections being properly controlled ,",
    "the potential benefit of our method is obvious .",
    "in this example , the set - level analysis of lamb et al s connectivity map identified 8 compounds with a false discovery rate of @xmath47 ( 1/8 ) , while the set - level analysis using our method identified 24 compounds with a false discovery rate of @xmath48 ( 1/24 ) . based on the findings of the connectivity maps",
    ", researchers can prioritize a small sub set of those compounds for further investigations and/or developing new biological hypotheses .",
    "for this example , using lamb et al s connectivity map , the chance of pursuing a false connection is @xmath47 , while using our method it is much lower at @xmath48 . in practice",
    "this would save the researchers an enormous amount of time and resources and increase their rate of success .",
    "the second example was a gene signature ( lamb s gene signature sigs02 ) taken from a study @xcite of mcf7 cells treated with estradiol .",
    "this gene signature consisted of @xmath49 up- and @xmath50 down - regulated genes represented by @xmath51 affymetrix probe - set ids on the affymetrix hg - u133a microarrays .",
    "we queried both lamb et al s connectivity map and the connectivity map presented in this paper with this estrogen signature .    for the same reason given above",
    ", we only used the treatment set level results of lamb et al s connectivity map , which identified 4 compounds ( genistein , estradiol , tretinoin , and alpha - estradiol ) as having significant positive connectivity with the estrogen signature ; and 5 compounds ( trichostatin a , fulvestrant , ly-294002 , vorinostat , and geldanamycin ) that had significant negative connectivity .    with our new connectivity map set - level analysis @xmath52 compounds",
    "were found to have significant positive connection , and @xmath43 compounds had significant negative connection to the estrogen gene signature .",
    "the @xmath52 compounds with positive connection included genistein , estradiol , and alpha - estradiol , all known to be estrogen receptor agonists .",
    "the @xmath43 compounds with negative connection included fulvestrant , raloxifene and tamoxifen , all known to be estrogen receptor antagonists . in comparison , the lamb method identified all the estrogen receptor agonists above , but missed all the estrogen receptor antagonists except fulvestrant .",
    "these results therefore indicate the sensitivity of our new method is substantially increased .",
    "the lamb method was able to detect the pure estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant , but missed the two compounds tamoxifen and raloxifene which have mixed antagonist and agonist estrogen receptor activities .",
    "the results from our set level analysis also suggest that nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( ndga ) has significant positive connection with estradiol .",
    "this connection is supported by recent studies @xcite , where ndga has been shown to have estrogenic activity and able to elicit an estrogen - like response .",
    "another compound monorden ( radicicol ) , suggested by our method as having negative connection to the estrogen gene signature , has been shown to repress the transcriptional function of the estrogen receptor @xcite which suggests that it may have some estrogen receptor antagonist - like properties .",
    "the tabulated results of querying both connectivity maps using the estrogen gene signature are included in the supplementary data .",
    "fig.[fig - estrogen ] summarizes the numbers of significant connections identified by both connectivity maps .",
    "all @xmath53 compounds found significant by lamb et al s connectivity map were also identified by the new method ( either on the instance level or on the set level or both ) .",
    "however many compounds identified as significant with either positive or negative connection to estradiol using our method were not identified by lamb et al s connectivity map , included amongst these were raloxifene , tamoxifen , monorden , and ndga .",
    "for further testing we compiled a new gene signature from a study on cardiac allograft rejection and response to immunosuppressive therapy @xcite , where patients were treated with standard immunosuppression with corticosteroids , antimetabolites , calcineurin inhibitors , and/or sirolimus .",
    "this gene signature consisted of 40 affymetrix probe set ids ( see table 2 of @xcite ) . our set - level analysis identified 29 compounds as having significant connections with this gene signature .",
    "the three top compounds were azathioprine , thalidomide , and rosiglitazone .",
    "azathioprine is a commonly used immunosuppressive drug @xcite , so its significant positive connection with the gene signature is a good indication that our new connectivity map works very well here .",
    "the second compound thalidomide , which had a positive connection score , also has known immunosuppressive activities @xcite , inhibits release of tnf@xmath54 from monocytes , and modulates other cytokine actions .",
    "the recognized properties of these molecules therefore accord with the outcome of the connectivity matching .",
    "the third compound rosiglitazone had a negative connection with the signature suggesting it may have properties to reduce or mitigate the effects of immunosuppressive activity .",
    "recently , rosiglitazone was reported to suppress cyclosporin - induced chronic transplant dysfunction and prolong survival of rat cardiac allografts ( chen et al , 2007 , transplantation ) , where cyclosporin is also a commonly used immunosuppressive drug .    at the instance level ,",
    "our method identified @xmath50 reference profiles as having significant connections to the immunosuppressive drug gene signature , representing @xmath55 distinct compounds .",
    "the top 3 compounds were azathioprine , staurosporine , and trichostatin a , which all achieved positive connection scores with this gene signature .",
    "the second compound , staurosporine , a protein kinase c inhibitor , is classified as an antineoplastic and immunosuppressive antibiotic drug @xcite .",
    "the third compound , trichostatin a , was recently shown to have some immunosuppressive effects in leukemia t cells @xcite .",
    "therefore the method of instance testing could be particularly valuable for the identification of pharmacological and toxicological properties in novel molecules .",
    "we have presented in this paper a new framework for a connectivity map , with the advantages that statistical significance measures are calculated at both treatment instance level and treatment set level , thus providing effective control over false connections .",
    "this important safeguard was not available in lamb et al s connectivity map at the instance level , as revealed by the two examples of random gene signatures .",
    "as the connectivity maps are most useful for high throughput screening and for generating new biological hypothesis , it is crucial that false connections are tightly controlled , such that the users do not end up chasing false connections and wasting time and money . we compared the performance of lamb et al s connectivity map and the new method presented in this paper , using two gene signatures compiled by lamb et al and also a new gene signature for immunosuppressive drugs .",
    "all these examples demonstrated that our new method is more sensitive and gives more robust results than lamb et al s method .",
    "the set - level analysis of lamb et al s connectivity map tests an implicit null hypothesis that is not most appropriate .",
    "this can be seen more clearly from recent studies on the significance analysis of gene sets @xcite .",
    "tian et al were among the first groups of authors who made explicit distinctions between two null hypotheses @xcite concerning a set of entities ( a set of genes in context of tian et al s paper ) .",
    "in the present context of connectivity map , the two null hypotheses are :    \\1 .",
    "hypothesis @xmath56 : the treatment instances in a set show the same pattern of connections with the query gene signature compared with the rest of the treatment instances .",
    "hypothesis @xmath57 : the treatment set does not contain any treatment instances which have real connections with the query gene signature .",
    "tian et al s discussions over the relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite apply to a treatment set as follows : given all the @xmath2 treatment instances , even if none of them have real connection to the query gene signature , the observed connection scores of a treatment set could still be very different from those treatment instances outside of the set because of the special correlation structure among the treatment instances within the set .",
    "chen et al also raised some concerns with testing the hypothesis @xmath56 ( chen et al , 2007 , bioinformatics ) , that this hypothesis does not test whether the treatment set has above - random connections to the query gene signature , but rather it tests whether the observed connections in the set are more or less than a randomly formed set of same size .",
    "we agree with chen et al s assessment on the inappropriateness of @xmath56 .",
    "it was clear that lamb et al s connectivity map was testing the null hypothesis @xmath56 .",
    "here we tested @xmath57 which is more appropriate .",
    "our results indicate that the method presented here can identify many significant connections to a query gene signature",
    ". then what criteria should we use and which compounds should we choose if new biological hypotheses are to be developed ?",
    "our suggestion is to concentrate more on those compounds which have many replicate instances in the connectivity map . because the results obtained for those big treatment sets do not depend heavily on the quality of a small number of treatment instances , as in the case of small treatment sets or singleton sets ( treatment sets with only 1 instance each ) .",
    "lamb et al also recognized the importance of having replicate instances , and noted that the power to detect connections might be greater for compounds with many replicates . in defining a treatment set , ideally only the treatment instances of the same compound with the same dose and the same cell type",
    "should be considered as a set .",
    "for example , the biological state of hl60 cells perturbed by raloxifene should be considered as a different biological state from that of mcf7 cells perturbed with the same raloxifene , thus these two instances of raloxifene should not be put into the same set . in this paper for comparison purpose we adopted lamb et al s choice in defining a treatment set , i.e. , all the instances of a compounds were grouped together as a set regardless of their possible differences in dose or cell type .",
    "mixing the instances of a compound with different doses and/or different cell types increases the heterogeneity of an otherwise more homogenous treatment set .",
    "this tends to average out the distinct characteristics attributable to the cell type or dosage difference , making some set - level connections insignificant or their interpretation difficult . in such cases",
    "the instance level connections supported by statistical significance can be of great help in interpreting the results . for future connectivity maps",
    ", efforts should be made to provide as many more replicate treatment instances ( replicates with the same compound , the same dose , and the same cell type , etc ) so that the undesirable reliance on individual instances can be minimized .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the support of the microarray team of the mrc toxicology unit .",
    "sdz thanks qing wen for helpful discussions on a searching algorithm in the implementation of the new connectivity map ."
