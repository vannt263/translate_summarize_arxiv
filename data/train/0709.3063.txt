    "in recent years the discovery and characterization of exoplanets that transit their host stars has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the search for these planets has proceeded at a frantic pace leading to a proliferation of surveys following different strategies to find these elusive systems .",
    "a number of groups have opted to search for planets in galactic open clusters .",
    "this includes the ustaps @xcite , explore - oc @xcite , pisces @xcite , stepss @xcite and monitor @xcite projects as well as a survey by @xcite",
    ". there has also been significant work invested in developing optimum strategies to search for planets in open clusters @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind searching for transiting planets in open clusters is that since the properties of stars in clusters are easier to determine en masse than they are for field stars , and since cluster stars have more uniform properties than field stars , one can determine in a relatively straightforward fashion from the survey the frequency of planets in the cluster , or at least place a meaningful upper limit on it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while to date no confirmed transiting planet has been found in an open cluster , these surveys have produced a number of by - products unrelated to the study of planets .",
    "this includes improving the fundamental parameters ( age , distance , reddening and metallicity ) of clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , studying the general population of variable stars found in and around the clusters @xcite , studying low mass stellar rotation @xcite , and the discovery of a very low mass pre - main sequence eclipsing binary system @xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduce a deep transit survey of the intermediate age ( @xmath10 ) open cluster m37 ( ngc 2099 ) using the mmt .",
    "the survey was conducted over twenty nights between dec .",
    "2005 and jan 2006 , and we accumulated over 4000 quality images of the cluster .",
    "this is easily the largest telescope ever utilized for such a survey , and as a by - product we have conducted a very deep survey for variable stars in this cluster ( down to @xmath11 ) .",
    "we were motivated to conduct this transit survey by @xcite who suggested that it may be possible to find neptune - sized planets transiting solar - like stars by surveying an open cluster with a large telescope .",
    "preliminary observations of the well - studied open cluster ngc 6791 with the mmt suggested that this was indeed technically feasible @xcite .",
    "the results of the survey related to variable stars , transiting planets and stellar rotation will be presented in future papers , our goal in this paper is to present the observations , describe the data reduction procedures , and study the stars in our field .",
    "this includes refining estimates for the fundamental cluster parameters and studying the distribution of stars ( mass / luminosity functions ) and the dynamic state of the cluster .",
    "having good estimates for these parameters is essential for all subsequent results from this survey . in particular , it is necessary to know these parameters in order to obtain masses and radii for the cluster stars as a function of magnitude which in turn is needed to determine the frequency of planets from our transit survey .",
    "this paper is certainly not the first determination of the fundamental parameters for m37 . since 1996",
    "there have been at least seven published determinations of its age , distance and reddening @xcite , a spectroscopic determination of its metallicity @xcite , three photometric estimates of its metallicity @xcite , and two surveys for variable stars @xcite .",
    "the age estimates vary between @xmath12 myr , the distance modulus is @xmath13 , the reddening estimates vary between @xmath14 , and the metallicity estimates between @xmath15 = -0.2 $ ] and @xmath16 .",
    "as we will show below , our determination of the fundamental parameters is in good agreement with the previous values , but we do improve the precision of these measurements by using multi - color photometry , high resolution spectroscopy for a number of cluster members , new empirically calibrated isochrones due to @xcite and a detailed error analysis .    in the following section we will describe our observations which consist of @xmath17-band photometric time series data , @xmath2 photometry , and high resolution spectroscopy",
    "all obtained at the mmt",
    ". we will describe the photometric data reduction in  3 and present spectroscopic results in  4 . using the reduced spectra",
    "we will determine the temperatures , radial velocities and estimated metallicities for 127 stars in our field .",
    "we will then present and analyze color - magnitude diagrams in  5 , which when combined with the spectroscopic estimates for the metallicity and reddening of the cluster will allow us to obtain new estimates for the cluster fundamental parameters . in  6 we present the mass and luminosity functions of the cluster and in  7",
    "we discuss the radial density profile of the cluster .",
    "we conclude in  8 .",
    "the photometric observations were obtained over twenty four nights ( eight of which were half nights ) between december 21 , 2005 and january 21 , 2006 , as summarized in table  [ tab : obssummary ] .",
    "we obtained a total of @xmath18 5000 images using the megacam instrument @xcite on the mmt .",
    "megacam is a @xmath19 mosaic imager consisting of 36 2k@xmath204k , thinned , backside - illuminated ccds that are each read out by two amplifiers .",
    "the mosaic has an unbinned pixel scale of @xmath21 which allows for a well sampled point - spread - function ( psf ) even under the best seeing conditions . to decrease the read - out time we used @xmath22 binning with the gain set so that the pixel sensitivity became non - linear before the analog - to - digital conversion threshold of 65536 counts .",
    "because of the fine sampling and the relatively deep pixel wells , one can collect @xmath23 photons in @xmath24 seeing from a single star prior to saturation , setting the photon limit on the precision in a single exposure to @xmath18 0.25 mmag .",
    "the time series observations were centered on 05:52:19 , + 32:33:12 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we used the same guide stars for the entire run so that the pointing was stable to within a few pixels , this mitigates the effect of errors in the flat - field .",
    "we used an @xmath25 filter to maximize the sensitivity to smaller stars while avoiding fringing that would occur at longer wavelengths .",
    "the average time between exposures ( including read - out and time spent initializing for the next exposure ) was 24 seconds .",
    "figure  [ fig : m37_fov ] shows a typical mosaic image of the cluster .",
    "ideally one would like to observe the same stars from exposure to exposure while spending as little time as necessary with the shutter closed .",
    "in other words , one would like to maximize the exposure times on a fixed set of stars .",
    "as the exposure time is increased more stars are lost to saturation , and , more importantly , the fraction of the image that is lost to saturated stars and artifacts ( diffraction spikes and bleed columns ) increases .",
    "not only does this decrease the number of stars that can be observed , it also compromises the quality of the image and the ability to reduce the image to achieve high precision photometry for any of the stars . to determine the optimal exposure time we obtained a series of preliminary observations of m37 during a megacam engineering run on october 29 , 2005 .",
    "we found that in @xmath24 seeing an exposure time of sixty seconds was the longest we could go before saturation posed a problem for image quality .",
    "the exposure time of each image was chosen to keep a @xmath26 mag star as close to the saturation limit as possible while not allowing more than @xmath27 of the stars located near the main sequence on a color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to be contaminated by artifacts due to other saturated stars .",
    "after reading out an image we would calculate a suggested exposure time for the next image based on the seeing and atmospheric transparency . in calculating the suggested exposure time we used the source extractor program ( version 2.3.2 ) due to @xcite to measure the fwhm and peak pixel value of a fiducial star after each image",
    "was downloaded from the camera .",
    "we then calculated the exposure time that would be necessary to keep the peak pixel value of that star at the desired level : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the previous exposure time , @xmath30 is the measured peak pixel value , and @xmath31 is the desired peak pixel value .",
    "we also calculated the exposure time that would be necessary to keep constant the fraction of stars unaffected by artifacts that scale with the percentage of the image that is saturated using the following empirical relation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are parameters that we determined empirically for our field ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the exposure time is then given as the minimum of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 seconds , where we adopt a lower bound of @xmath39 seconds to avoid spending more than half the time with the shutter closed .",
    "typical exposure times as a function of seeing for photometric conditions are listed in table  [ tab : exptimes ] .",
    "in addition to the time series observations , we also obtained a number of observations to use in constructing color - magnitude diagrams of the cluster .",
    "these include 40 @xmath40 and 35 @xmath41 observations of our primary field obtained over four nights ( 12/23 , 12/24 , 12/27 and 12/30 ) .",
    "to observe the cluster main sequence turn - off and red giant stars we took a set of short exposure images ( @xmath42 seconds ) as well as longer exposure images to match the @xmath25 time series images . to calibrate our data we observed two fields covered by the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 ( sdss ; *",
    "the first of these fields , located at 03:20:00 , 00:00:00 ( j2000 ) was observed during photometric conditions on 12/24 and 12/27 .",
    "the second field , located at 08:00:00 , + 35:00:00 ( j2000 ) was observed during brief photometric conditions on 12/28 , 12/30 and 01/05 .",
    "the @xmath41 observations of the second field were only obtained on 12/30 .    finally , to estimate the cluster membership contamination we observed a field centered at 05:57:02 + 30:49:32 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the field is located two degrees from the primary m37 field and at the same galactic latitude .",
    "the observations for this field were obtained on 12/30 and 01/07 using an exposure time of @xmath43 seconds .      to follow - up our photometric observations we obtained spectra for 167 stars in the field of m37 with @xmath44 . for stars with @xmath45",
    "the signal to noise was too low to be useful for spectroscopic classification / radial velocity measurements . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectargetsoncmd ] we show the 127 spectroscopic targets with @xmath46 on @xmath47 and @xmath48 cmds .",
    "the targets include a number of candidate transiting planets , eclipsing binaries and other large - amplitude variables which we will describe elsewhere .",
    "there are 74 bright targets that lie near the cluster main sequence in @xmath47 and @xmath48 cmds and will be used to determine the reddening , metallicity , and radial velocity of the cluster .",
    "the latter quantity is used to assess the membership probability for transit candidates that are likely members based on their photometry .",
    "other targets not near the main sequence are used as a control sample .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the hectochelle multi - fiber , high - dispersion spectrograph @xcite on the mmt .",
    "hectochelle can provide spectra for up to 240 sources in a single exposure over a limited filter - selected wavelength range .",
    "we reserved 55 fibers for observations of the sky and 18 fibers were unassigned .",
    "the observations were conducted over six separate nights as summarized in table  [ tab : specsummary ] .",
    "the data from 03/03/2007 and 03/04/2007 have very high levels of sky contamination , so we were unable to extract usable spectra from them .",
    "we used the rv31 filter which covers the range @xmath49 at a resolution of 32000 .",
    "the camera was read - out using @xmath50 binning to improve the signal - to - noise of the faintest targets ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we used an exposure time of @xmath52 minutes .",
    "the data reduction pipeline for photometric observations consists of five steps :    1 .",
    "ccd calibration including astrometry 2 .",
    "psf fitting photometry 3 .",
    "photometric calibration 4 .",
    "image subtraction time series photometry 5 .",
    "post - processing of light curves    in this paper we will discuss the first three of these steps . the fourth step will be discussed in a separate paper on variable stars and the final step , which consists of removing real stellar variability as well as instrumental variations from the light curves for the purpose of searching for transits , will be discussed in a separate paper on the results of the transit survey .",
    "the ccd calibration consists of subtracting the bias from each image extension using an overscan correction , trimming the overscan region from the image , applying a flat - field to the mosaic image , and merging the output from the two amplifiers on a given chip into a single image .",
    "the supplementary data ( images used for constructing the cmds and measuring the membership contamination ) were calibrated using the standard routines in the iraf mscred package . to reduce i / o overhead we performed the calibrations on the time series observations using our own implementation of the routines written in c.    to flatten our images we used observations of the twilight sky .",
    "because conditions were acceptable for flat - fielding on only a handful of evenings , we constructed a single master flat - field in each filter from all available twilight images .",
    "temporal variations in the flat - field over the course of the run may be responsible for some systematic variations in the light curves that must be removed before searching for transiting planets and other low amplitude phenomena .",
    "we did notice slight temporal variations in the gain between the two amplifiers that read out a given chip . to correct for this in calibrating the time series data we first applied the flat field and then scaled one of the amplifiers on each chip by the mode of the quotient of pixels to the left and right of the amplifier boundary . in performing the correction we did not match the chip to chip variations in the gain since the time series photometry",
    "is done independently for each chip .    to obtain the astrometric solution for the mosaic images we used the _ megawcs _ program which is part of the megacam reduction package .",
    "we used the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite as our astrometric reference .      to construct the cmds for the cluster and the field off the cluster we performed psf fitting photometry on a number of the images .",
    "we used the daophot 2 and allstar programs @xcite to do this .",
    "the process was run in batch mode because there were too many images to process by hand .",
    "we followed a fairly standard procedure .",
    "we used daophot to identify stars , choose candidate psf stars , determine the psf , and allstar to fit the profile to all identified stars on the image .",
    "we then used the daogrow program @xcite to determine the aperture correction on the psf stars .",
    "we did not search for additional stars on the residual images as the field is not terribly crowded and doing this typically yielded more spurious detections of artifacts in the residuals of bright stars than detections of additional stars .",
    "the data processed with psf fitting photometry include all @xmath40 and @xmath41 cluster images , 56 @xmath25 mosaic images of the cluster taken during photometric conditions , images taken of the field off the cluster and the images taken of the sloan fields .    in order to detect faint stars we also constructed a number of stacked images that we performed psf fitting photometry on . among these",
    "are the reference @xmath25 images of the primary field ; the construction of these is done as part of the image subtraction photometry routine which will be described elsewhere .",
    "briefly , the process consists of matching the background and seeing of @xmath53 of the best seeing images for each chip using the method of @xcite and @xcite before mean - combining them .",
    "other stacked images include a set of short exposure @xmath25 images of the primary field taken through several magnitudes of extinction , sets of short exposure @xmath40 and @xmath41 images of the primary field , sets of long exposure @xmath40 and @xmath41 images of the primary field taken in good seeing conditions and sets of images of the field off the cluster .",
    "we stacked the short exposure images to provide overlap with the deeper images and thus tie the photometry of the brighter stars to that of the fainter stars .",
    "we used the high extinction @xmath25 images to obtain photometry for the bright stars because the short exposure @xmath25 images that we obtained did not provide adequate magnitude coverage .",
    "we note , therefore , that the @xmath25 photometry for the brightest stars is of poorer quality than the @xmath40 and @xmath41 photometry for these stars .      to cover the main sequence from the turn - off at @xmath54 down to m dwarf stars at @xmath11 we tie together the photometry of the bright stars from the stacked short exposure images and the photometry of the faint stars from the stacked long exposure images .",
    "this instrumental photometry is then transformed to the sloan 2.5 m system .",
    "since the shallow and deep stacked images are composed of images obtained on a variety of non - photometric nights , the photometry from these images has to be matched to photometry of the cluster obtained during photometric conditions before transforming to the sloan 2.5 m system .",
    "the steps involved may be summarized as follows :    1 .   find the transformation from the instrumental psf fitting magnitude measurements for a given photometric night to the sloan 2.5 m system .",
    "the transformation includes zero - point , airmass and color terms .",
    "2 .   calculate the average instrumental magnitudes for target stars observed on that photometric night after correcting for differences between the exposure times and airmasses using the zero - point and airmass terms found in step 1 .",
    "match the stacked short and long exposure images from non - photometric nights to the list from step 2 to get a full star list .",
    "4 .   apply the color terms in the transformation found in step 1 to the full list .",
    "instrumental psf fitting magnitude measurements are transformed to the sloan 2.5 m system using observations taken of the equatorial sloan field centered at 03:20:00 , 00:00:00 ( j2000 ) .",
    "conditions during the observing run were rarely photometric , as a result we were only able to constrain the airmass terms in the transformation from the observations of this field taken on 12/27/2005 .",
    "we also attempted using the second sloan field for calibration but found that the observations did not span a large enough range in airmass to constrain the airmass terms . after matching our star list for the images of the first sloan field to the star list extracted from the sdss data release 5 , we fit a transformation of the form : @xmath55 where @xmath40 , @xmath25 and @xmath41 are instrumental magnitudes , @xmath56 , @xmath17 and @xmath57 are sloan magnitudes , @xmath58 is the airmass of the observation , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the airmass terms to fit for , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are color terms to fit for and that we take to be the same for all chips in the mosaic and @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the zero - point terms for chip @xmath68 that we fit for .",
    "we used a single color term for the entire mosaic because there were not enough stars in this field to constrain the color term for each chip independently .",
    "we used a single color term in each transformation since we found that including two color terms resulted in more scatter in the cmds .",
    "the fit is performed only on stars with formal magnitude errors less than @xmath69 mag , in doing the fit we iteratively reject @xmath70 outliers .",
    "the parameters that we determined , together with their standard errors , are listed in tables  [ tab : photcalparams ] and  [ tab : photcalparams2 ] ; the listed zero points are adjusted to have a mean value of 0 over all the chips .",
    "the rms of the residuals after applying the transformation in equation  [ eqn : transformation ] to the sloan data are 0.025 mag in @xmath40 , 0.016 mag in @xmath25 and 0.021 mag in @xmath41 .",
    "we take these as estimates of the systematic error in our transformation to the sloan system . in figure",
    "[ fig : photcalresid ] we plot the residuals after applying the transformation to the sloan data . in figure",
    "[ fig : photcalcolor ] we show the color dependence of the transformation by plotting the residuals after applying everything except the color terms in the transformation .      after fitting for the parameters , we invert the transformation in equation  [ eqn : transformation ] to yield @xmath56 , @xmath17 and @xmath57 for a star as a function of @xmath40 , @xmath25 , @xmath41 , @xmath58 and the chip number . to apply this transformation to the m37 data we first define @xmath71 and similarly for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these corrections are applied to all magnitude measurements of stars in the m37 field made during photometric conditions on 12/27/2005 .",
    "we then match sources from different images using a radius of @xmath74 and calculate the average @xmath75 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 values for each source .",
    "we use the resulting star list as a template to tie together the higher precision , deeper photometry from the stacked images .",
    "we match the star lists from each of the stacked images to the template list and calculate the magnitude offset between the matched stars for each chip .",
    "this offset is then applied to the stacked image magnitudes .",
    "for the bright stacked @xmath40 observations the scatter on this transformation is typically less than @xmath69 mag , for the deeper stacked @xmath40 observations the scatter is typically less than @xmath76 mag .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath25 are @xmath69 mag and @xmath77 mag , while for @xmath41 the values are @xmath78 mag and @xmath79 mag .",
    "the stacked image star lists are then combined to form a full list of stars with @xmath75 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 magnitudes . in combining the stacked star lists , when a source is detected in both the shallow and deep images we take the error weighted average of the two magnitudes",
    "if the difference between them is less than @xmath80 mag and the instrumental magnitude measured on the deeper image is less than @xmath81 , otherwise we ignore the magnitude from the shallow image .",
    "the color transformations are applied to the full star list to yield a final list with magnitudes on the sloan system .",
    "only sources detected in all three filters are transformed .",
    "this final star list has 16483 sources with @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "table  [ tab : phot_catalog ] provides the first few lines of our photometric catalog , the full version is available in the electronic edition of the journal - note that we have kept our own numbering system in this table .",
    "the observations of the field off the cluster were not taken on the same nights as the observations of the sloan fields , though they were taken under photometric conditions .",
    "to convert these observations to the sloan system we determine the transformation from instrumental magnitudes on the night in question to sloan magnitudes using observations of m37 .",
    "since we did not have enough observations to constrain the airmass term in the transformation we use the airmass term that was determined on 12/27/2005 ; we expect that the error from making this assumption should be less than @xmath85 mag .",
    "the telescope data center ( tdc ) at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) provides reduced hectochelle spectra to observers .",
    "the reduction pipeline is described on the tdc website . for sources fainter than @xmath86 we found that sky contamination was significant .",
    "to correct for this we fit , at each wavelength , a third order polynomial in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 fiber positions to the 55 sky spectra .",
    "this provides an estimate for the sky spectrum at the location of each target fiber which we then subtract .",
    "we use the reduced spectra to classify the stars and measure their radial velocities as described in the following subsections .      despite the fact that our hectochelle observations cover only a @xmath91 range , there are a number of absorption lines in this range that can be used to determine spectroscopic parameters ( @xmath89 , @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath92 and @xmath90 ) for the observed stars .",
    "the observed wavelength range includes the mgi triplet lines as well as many weaker lines of neutral mg , fe , ti , cr , and ni .",
    "the temperature is the variable that most strongly controls the line strength .",
    "the sensitivity arises from the exponential and power dependencies with temperature in the excitation - ionization processes .",
    "the mgi lines are also very sensitive to gravity with their wings dominated by stark and van der waals broadening .",
    "the dependence on gravity of the weaker lines depends on their ionization state .",
    "metallicity affects all lines .",
    "we classify the stars following the procedure due to meibom et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) that has been developed specifically for the hectochelle rv31 filter .",
    "the procedure is to cross - correlate the spectra against templates drawn from a grid of atlas 9 model atmospheres and computed using the companion program synthe @xcite .",
    "the current library has a total of 51,359 spectra over effective temperatures ( @xmath89 ) from @xmath93 in steps of @xmath94 , over gravity from @xmath92 of @xmath95 in steps of @xmath96 , over metallicity ( @xmath15 $ ] ) from -2.5 to + 0.5 in steps of 0.5 , and over rotation velocity from @xmath97 km / s . at this time",
    "@xmath98 $ ] is set to 0.0 , microturbulence to 2 km / s and macroturbulence to 1 km / s .",
    "the cross - correlation is performed using the _ xcsao _ routine in the iraf _ rvsao _ package @xcite . for each spectrum",
    "we determine the @xmath89 , @xmath92 , @xmath90 and @xmath7 $ ] which yields the highest cross - correlation r value .",
    "the peak values are interpolated within the grid .",
    "note that we used model atmospheres without @xmath99-enhancement , so @xmath15 = [ m / h]$ ] .",
    "we have also attempted fixing @xmath89 while varying the other three parameters as well as fixing @xmath92 to @xmath100 ( assuming all stars are dwarfs ) while varying the other parameters . to fix @xmath89 for each star we use the star s @xmath101 color from @xcite , a reddening of @xmath102 and the theoretical color - effective temperature relation from the @xmath7 = 0.045 $ ] , 485 myr yrec isochrone ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "we find that the spectra are not of high enough quality to independently determine all four parameters ; when we attempt to do so the resulting @xmath103 and @xmath104 relations are inconsistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "similarly , when using @xmath105 to fix @xmath89 the resulting @xmath103 relation is inconsistent with the theoretical relation .",
    "we find , however , that when we fix @xmath106 the @xmath104 relation is in good agreement with the theoretical relation .",
    "we therefore choose to fix @xmath106 , which is a good assumption for the cluster members as well as for the field stars which are predominately background dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : bvteff_fixlogg ] shows the @xmath101 vs. @xmath89 relation when fixing @xmath106 .",
    "the cluster sequence is in good agreement with the expected value assuming @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ fig : histmet_fixlogg ] shows the resulting metallicity histogram for photometrically selected cluster members (  5.1 ) that have a radial velocity within 3@xmath107 of the cluster systemic velocity ( see below ) , photometrically selected cluster members that have a radial velocity that is discrepant from the systemic velocity by more than @xmath70 and non - members .",
    "the cluster members that pass the radial velocity cut show a distribution that is strongly peaked at @xmath7 \\sim 0.0 $ ] while the other stars show a broader distribution that is peaked at a somewhat lower metallicity .",

    "since the measured values of @xmath89 , @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath90 are correlated with @xmath92 , it is important to estimate the systematic error on these parameters that results from fixing @xmath106 . from the theoretical yrec isochrones , we expect that the observed cluster members should have @xmath92 ranging from @xmath110 at the bright end to @xmath111 at the faint end . by performing the cross - correlation with @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "we find that fixing @xmath106 results in a systematic error per point in @xmath89 of @xmath114 , a systematic error in @xmath7 $ ] of @xmath115 and negligible systematic errors in @xmath90 .",

    "there is , however , some indication that the binary fraction along the main sequence in this cluster is closer to @xmath264 @xcite , so the actual biases will likely be less than this .      for the purposes of the transit survey the most important measurements that come from isochrone fitting are the masses and radii of the main sequence stars .",
    "it is therefore necessary to propagate the uncertainties in the fundamental cluster parameters into systematic uncertainties on the masses / radii .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mrunc ] we plot the mass-@xmath17 and radius-@xmath17 relations for the cluster calculated from the yrec isochrones assuming the parameters in table  [ tab : m37finalparams ] .",

    "we find that the background contamination for stars selected near the main sequence in @xmath2 is @xmath288 which is comparable to the contamination of @xmath289 determined from the radial velocity distribution (  4.3 ) .    to compute the mf we follow a similar procedure as for the lf .",
    "in this case we estimate the masses for each star near the cluster main sequence using the mass-@xmath17 relation described in  5.3 . because we do not have very deep or shallow observations of the field off the cluster we use our photometry to compute the mf only over the range @xmath290 .",
    "we also use 2mass to compute the mf over the range @xmath291 using a mass-@xmath158 relation derived in a similar fashion to the mass-@xmath17 relation . the upper mass limit in this case",
    "is roughly the turn - off mass of the cluster .",
    "we compute the 2mass mf in bins of width @xmath292 for stars within @xmath293 of the cluster center taking the field star density within each mass bin from an annulus of inner radius @xmath293 and width @xmath294 . to correct for the spatial incompleteness of our observations we integrate the best fit radial density profile models for the mass bins @xmath295 ,",
    "@xmath296 , @xmath297 ( see below ) over our field of view .",
    "we find that our observations have a spatial completeness of @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath299 for each of the respective mass bins .",
    "we scale our mf in each mass bin by the inverse of the completeness before combining with the 2mass mf .",
    "we assume that stars with @xmath300 have a spatial completeness of @xmath298 .",
    "the resulting completeness and contamination corrected mf for the cluster is shown in figure  [ fig : m37_mf ] with the data given in tables  [ tab : m37_mf ]  and  [ tab : m37_mf_2mass ] .    as reviewed recently by @xcite , the initial mass function ( imf ) for the galactic field and young open clusters",
    "follows a power law of the form : @xmath301 for massive stars , @xmath302 , with an exponent of @xmath303 @xcite . for lower mass stars",
    "the imf appears to follow a log - normal form @xcite : @xmath304.\\ ] ] both cases include unresolved binaries .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : m37_mf ] shows this imf after normalizing to match the high mass cluster data .",
    "for @xmath305 the observed cluster mf is in good agreement with the galactic imf . below this value",
    ", however , the cluster mf flattens out .",
    "this indicates that dynamical processes such as mass segregation and evaporation are important for this cluster .",
    "this is expected given that the cluster is slightly older than its relaxation time @xcite .",
    "integrating the mass function we estimate that the cluster contains @xmath306 stars with @xmath307 which contribute @xmath308 to the total mass .",
    "extrapolating to the hydrogen burning limit assuming a flat mass function in @xmath309 as seen in figure  [ fig : m37_mf ] , we estimate that there are @xmath310 stars with @xmath311 which contribute @xmath312 to the cluster mass . @xcite",
    "have shown that the cluster contains 35 red giants , which , assuming a mass of @xmath135 , would contribute @xmath313 to the cluster mass . finally @xcite estimate that the cluster contains @xmath314 white dwarfs with masses between @xmath315 .",
    "so we conclude that the cluster contains @xmath316 stars down to the hydrogen burning limit and has a total mass of @xmath317 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the 4000 stars and @xmath318 determined by @xcite ; the discrepancy is most likely due to their uncorrected slight spatial incompleteness ( their field of view was @xmath319 ) , as well as to differences in the estimated slope of the mf for @xmath320 stars .",
    "of particular interest for the transit survey is the number of cluster members for which we have obtained time series photometry .",
    "we estimate that this number is @xmath321 within the mass range @xmath290 ( corresponding to the magnitude range @xmath322 ) .",
    "we will now investigate the radial density distribution of the cluster which will give us information about its dynamical state .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have previously determined the radial density profile using their own photometry . because our field of view does not extend to the tidal radius of the cluster we will first measure the tidal radius using 2mass .",
    "the advantage of using 2mass is that one can extract uniform photometry over a wide field that extends beyond the tidal radius .",
    "the average field star density is therefore more secure than the determinations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of 2mass is that it does not go nearly as deep as the optical surveys so it can not be used to investigate processes such as mass segregation .",
    "figure  [ fig : m37_2mass_radialdensity ] shows the radial density distribution of stars from 2mass in bins of width @xmath323 .",
    "we have included all stars within the range @xmath324 to avoid completeness problems at the faint end , and have adopted the cluster center of 05:52:17.6 , 32:32:08 ( j2000 ) from @xcite .",
    "they estimate that the error on the center is @xmath325 and is dominated by small number statistics .",
    "the data plotted in this figure does not have the field star contribution subtracted .",
    "the dotted line shows the best fit single - mass king profile @xcite which has a tidal radius of @xmath326 , and a core radius of @xmath327 .",
    "the other two free parameters in the fit are the central density of @xmath328 stars / square arcminute and the field density of @xmath329 stars / square arcminute . of these four parameters",
    "only @xmath330 should be insensitive to the specific magnitude range and filter used .    using the distance determined in  5.2 , we find that the tidal radius is @xmath331 pc which is in agreement with the expected value of 22.8 pc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* we have recalculated the expected value using our new mass estimate ) , assuming a mass of the galaxy within the cluster s orbit of @xmath332 @xcite and a galactocentric distance of @xmath333 kpc .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m37_radialdensity_massbins ] we show the radial density distribution corrected for field star contamination in four different mass bins .",
    "the stars are selected into the first three mass bins based on their proximity to the cluster main sequence in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 cmds , whereas the fourth mass bin consists of 2mass detections .",
    "we have subtracted an average star density from each bin measured using the off - cluster observations , and have rescaled the curves to have the central density of the lowest mass bin .",
    "the higher mass stars appear to be more centrally concentrated than the lower mass stars . to quantify this we fit a king model to each of the mass bins fixing the tidal radius to the value found above and the field density to the values measured using the off - cluster observations .",
    "we find @xmath334 for @xmath295 , @xmath335 for @xmath296 , @xmath336 for @xmath297 and @xmath337 for @xmath338 .",
    "fitting a linear relation between @xmath309 and @xmath339 we find @xmath340 so that the probability that the system does not exhibit mass segregation ( i.e. the probability that the slope in the above relation is consistent with zero or positive ) is less than @xmath341 .",
    "we have introduced a deep transit survey of the open cluster m37 . this survey is unique among open cluster variability surveys , and among time - series surveys in general , in terms of the number of images acquired with such a large telescope .",
    "this effectively allows us to study low - amplitude variability among low mass stars in a richer and older cluster than can be targeted with a smaller telescope .",
    "we therefore expect to have a unique data set for studying general stellar variability , stellar rotation and small amplitude transiting planets .",
    "we will discuss each of these topics in future papers .    in this paper",
    "we have laid the groundwork for these future investigations by refining the fundamental cluster parameters . by comparing photometry and high resolution spectroscopy with an empirically calibrated set of theoretical main sequence isochrones we have determined @xmath3 myr without overshooting , @xmath7 = + 0.045 \\pm 0.044 $ ] , @xmath5 and @xmath342 which are in good agreement with , though more precise than , previous measurements .",
    "we have obtained mass and luminosity functions and have shown that they are consistent with the galactic imf down to @xmath343 with evidence for evaporation below that level .",
    "we have also found mass segregation by comparing the radial density profiles in different mass bins .",
