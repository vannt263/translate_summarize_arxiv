    "oscillations excited by turbulent convection - solar - like oscillations - have been successfully identified in cool main - sequence and post - main - sequence stars with convective envelopes . in the red giants ,",
    "solar - like oscillations have been first detected by ground - based observations @xcite and by the wire satellite @xcite .",
    "difficulties in the identification of the observed modes , led several authors @xcite to speculate on the pulsational properties of the red - giant stars .",
    "red giants are characterized by a deep convective envelope and a small degenerate helium core .",
    "since the density in the core of these stars is quite large , the buoyancy frequency can reach very large values in the central part . in these conditions ,",
    "g modes of high frequencies can propagate and might eventually interact with p modes giving rise to modes of mixed character . as a consequence , the spectrum of the red giants is predicted to have a quite complicated appearance , with a sequence of peaks uniformly spaced in frequency due to acoustic modes , and other peaks with less clear pattern due to mixed modes .",
    "the detection of solar - like oscillations in red giants has been well established by the space mission most @xcite , while the corot satellite was able to detect for the first time non - radial modes in red - giant stars @xcite and to find solar - like oscillations in a very large sample of g and k giant stars @xcite mainly lying in the core - helium - burning evolutionary phase @xcite .",
    "the high - quality observations of the _ kepler _ mission @xcite enabled to extend the detection of solar - like oscillations from the red clump to the lower luminosity region of the red - giant branch @xcite , where stars are still burning h in the shell .",
    "this finding enables us to study the structure and the evolution of the stars from the main - sequence phase up to advanced evolutionary stages by means of asteroseismology @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present the results of the analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the red giant kic  4351319 ( tyc  3124 - 914 - 1 )  nicknamed ` pooh ' @xcite within the authorship team   observed by the _",

    ", we also consider the theoretical interpretation of the observations and derive the asteroseismic estimates of age , mass and radius and of other structural characteristics , making use of the accurate atmospheric parameters obtained by ground - based spectroscopy performed at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the star selected for this study is of particular interest because its oscillation spectrum shows an excess of power centered at frequency @xmath14hz , higher than is typical for _ kepler _ red giants @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the star is well below the red clump in luminosity and is still ascending the red - giant branch @xcite .",
    "its relatively high frequencies require _ kepler _ s short - cadence mode ( see section 4 ) , which means that only relatively few stars with these characteristics are being observed by _",
    "kic  4351319 therefore provides a very important opportunity to study this evolutionary phase and hence it has been selected for long - term observations by _",
    "spectroscopic observations of kic4351319 in the visible spectral range have been carried out on 2010 july 26 ( hjd=2455404.7756 ) with the cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph at the 2.7-m `` harlan j. smith '' telescope at the mcdonald observatory , texas , usa , in the framework of the ground - based observational support of the _ kepler _ space mission @xcite . + a stellar spectrum , wavelength - calibrated and normalized to the continuum , was obtained using standard data - reduction procedures for spectroscopic observations within the noao /iraf package .",
    "the resulting signal - to - noise ratio was @xmath15 .",
    "the spectral resolution as measured from the th - ar emission lines is about r=65000 .    in order to derive the effective temperature and surface gravity for our target , we minimized the difference between observed and synthetic profiles . as a goodness - of - fit test we used the parameter : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total number of independent points in the spectrum , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the intensities of the observed and computed profiles , respectively , and @xmath20 is the photon noise .",
    "the synthetic spectra were generated in three steps : first we computed the stellar atmosphere model by using the atlas9 code @xcite , then the stellar spectrum was synthesized using synthe @xcite and finally the instrumental and rotational convolutions were applied .",
    "the atlas9 code includes the metal opacity by means of distribution functions ( odf ) that are tabulated for multiples of the solar metallicity and for various microturbulence velocities .",
    "we selected a set of vanadium and iron lines in the range between 6180   and 6280   , which are free of blending and whose atomic parameters are well known and already explored for temperature calibrations ( see * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) . for surface gravity we used the non - saturated line cai at6162.173 , whose wings are very sensitive to gravity changes ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "first of all , we computed the @xmath21 of the star by using the parameters from the kic catalogue @xcite reported in table  [ par ] .",
    "we used synthe to reproduce the observed metal lines , and our best match was achieved convolving the computed lines with a stellar rotational profile having @xmath21=6@xmath221 km s@xmath23 , while the microturbulent velocity @xmath24 was obtained by using the relation @xmath25 published by @xcite .",
    "+ then , with an iterative procedure starting with the values of the kic catalogue of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the solar abundances given by @xcite , we obtained the best fit values reported in table  [ par ] .",

    "it is well known that the properties of solar - like oscillations in main - sequence stars can be described by adopting the asymptotic development @xcite , which predicts that the oscillations frequencies @xmath44 of acoustic modes , characterized by radial order @xmath45 , and harmonic degree @xmath46 , for @xmath47 should satisfy the following approximation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a function of frequency and depends on the properties of the surface layers and @xmath50 , known as the large frequency separation , is the inverse of the sound travel time across the stellar diameter and is proportional to the square root of the mean density .",
    "thus , the solar - like oscillations spectra should show a series of equally spaced peaks separated by @xmath50 between p modes of same degree and adjacent @xmath45 : @xmath51    in addition , the solar - like power spectra are characterized by another series of peaks , whose separation is @xmath52 , known as the small separation : @xmath53 which is sensitive to the chemical composition gradient in the central regions of the star and hence to its evolutionary state .",
    "the determination of the large and small frequency separations can provide asteroseismic inferences on the mass and the age of main - sequence and post - main - sequence solar - type stars , using the so - called seismic diagnostic c - d diagram @xcite .",
    "however , these two seismic indicators alone do not represent an unambiguous diagnostic tool for more evolved stars , for which the relation between the small and large separation is almost linear @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the stellar mass and radius of a solar - like star can successfully be derived , within @xmath10 and @xmath54 respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from measurements of the large separation and @xmath55 , the frequency at which the oscillation signal reaches a maximum , by using the scaling laws given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to characterize in details the structure of a red - giant star , it is necessary to consider individual frequencies of oscillation and other oscillation properties , as we will discuss in the following .",
    "the properties of solar - like oscillations are expected to change as the stellar structure evolves . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and considering that @xmath56 , oscillation frequencies of a given harmonic degree should decrease as the star evolves and the radius increases and should be almost uniformly spaced by @xmath57 at each stage of evolution . however , in subgiants and red giants the radial modes seem to follow eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) closely , but the frequencies of some non - radial modes appear to be shifted from the regular spacing due to the occurrence of the so - called ` avoided crossing ' @xcite . as the star evolves away from the main sequence , the core contracts and the radius expands , causing an increase of the local gravitational acceleration and of the gradients in the hydrogen abundance , and hence of the buoyancy frequency in the deep interior of the star . as a consequence g modes with high frequencies are allowed to propagate and can interact with p modes of similar frequency and same harmonic degree , giving rise to modes with mixed character , which behave as g modes in the interior and p modes in the outer envelope @xcite .",
    "the interaction can be explained as the coupling of two oscillators of similar frequencies .",
    "the effect of the coupling becomes much weaker for modes with higher harmonic degree , since in these cases the gravity waves are better trapped in the stellar interior and hence better separated from the region of propagation of the acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "it has been found by @xcite and observationally demonstrated by @xcite , that the scatter of @xmath58 modes caused by ` avoided crossing ' decreases as the star goes up to the red - giant branch : as the luminosity increases and the core become denser , the @xmath58 acoustic modes are better trapped and the oscillation spectra become more regular .",
    "once the star ignites he in the core , the core expands and the external convective zone becomes shallower which has the effect of increasing the probability of coupling between g and p modes again .",
    "very recently , @xcite have demonstrated that the quality of the _ kepler _ observations gives the possibility to measure the period spacings of mixed - modes with gravity - dominated character which , like pure gravity modes , penetrate deeply in the core allowing to study the density contrast between the core region and the convective envelope and , like p modes , have amplitude at the surface high enough to be observed .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that measurements of the the period spacings of the gravity - dominated mixed modes , permit to distinguish between hydrogen- and helium - burning stages of evolution of the red giants .",
    "the occurrence of mixed modes is then a strong indicator of the evolutionary state of a red - giant star and the fitting of the observed modes with those calculated by theoretical models can provide not only mass and radius but , with a good approximation , an estimate of the age of the star .",
    "sharp variations localized at a certain acoustic depth in the structure of pulsating stars produce a distinctive quasi - periodic signal in the frequencies of oscillations .",
    "the characteristics of such signal are related to the location and thermodynamic properties of the layer where the sharp variation occurs .",
    "sources of sharp variations are for example the borders of convection zones and regions of rapid variation in the first adiabatic exponent @xmath59 , where the derivative corresponds to an adiabatic change , such as the one that occurs in the region of the second ionization of helium . + in the main - sequence stars the signals coming from different sharp features in the interior , overlap generating a complex behaviour @xcite . in red giants ,",
    "a recent study by @xcite demonstrated that the oscillatory signal of the frequencies observed is directly related only to the second helium ionization zone .",
    "several attempts have been made in order to isolate the generated oscillatory components from the frequencies of oscillations or from linear combinations of them such as large separations and second differences . in principle , this approach can be applied to determine the properties of the base of the convective envelope @xcite and in particular to infer the helium abundance in the stellar envelope @xcite .",

    "the size of the symbols is proportional to the theoretical oscillation amplitudes of p modes , relative to the amplitudes of radial modes with the same frequency ( see eq .",
    "[ ampl ] ) .",
    "the results show , as explained in previous sections , that the observed modes are @xmath70 pure acoustic modes , and @xmath58 and @xmath71 nearly pure p modes and some @xmath58 and @xmath71 g - p mixed modes .",
    "some non - radial modes with mixed gravity - pressure character have an inertia so low as to propagate up to the surface and appear to behave like solar - like oscillations .",
    "very few mixed modes , with a quite high inertia , keep their gravity character , although the combination with a p mode enhance their amplitude so that they can be observed at the surface and in the chelle diagram appear to depart strongly from the regular solar - like pattern . + pure g modes at lower frequencies , have not been detected with the present observations .",
    "solar - like oscillations with @xmath72 , although theoretically predicted , have not been detected , probably due to geometrical reasons which produce the cancellation of the observed signal .",
    "we found that there is a very good agreement between observed and theoretical frequencies .",
    "in particular we are able to reproduce all the @xmath58 mixed modes .",
    "the presence of mixed - modes with @xmath71 needs to be better investigated : unfortunately none of our best models , shown in fig .",
    "[ echelle ] , is able to reproduce the @xmath71 mode with frequency @xmath73hz .",
    "in addition , the results show that it is quite difficult to determine which of model  1 and model  5 best reproduces the observations .",
    "perhaps the ambiguity will be solved by the identification of modes at lower frequencies and in particular if the reality of the mode of @xmath74hz ( see sect .",
    "4 ) will be confirmed or not .",
    "another important issue is related to the possibility of observing rotational splittings in this star .",
    "we estimate that the observed rotational velocity @xmath75 , quite high for this kind of objects , might produce a rotational splitting of @xmath76hz for the modes of @xmath71 , @xmath77 in case of rigid rotation .",
    "such a rotational splitting is about twice the value of the frequency resolution of the @xmath78 data set . to check for the signature of rotation we have re - run the frequency determination now adding rotational split components for @xmath58 and @xmath71 modes . the rotation frequency and the inclination angle",
    "were allowed to vary in the range between @xmath79hz and @xmath80 respectively , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the global likelihoods of the two models ( with and without rotation ) indicates that the rotation - free model is about 70 times more likely than the model including rotation .",
    "+ indeed , the presence of two modes closely spaced in frequency does not prove that we deal with rotational splitting although this possibility can not be excluded .",
    "moreover , the two pairs of close frequencies of @xmath71 suspected for evidence of rotational splittings ( @xmath81hz with @xmath82hz and @xmath83hz with @xmath84hz ) , appear to be not separated by a same amount in frequency , indicating that they can not be both appearance of rotational splittings .",
    "we finally notice that in order to reproduce the observed modes , we did not need to correct the frequencies for the surface effects , as suggested by @xcite , but the small departure of the @xmath70 modes at high frequency might be indicative of the need of such a correction .",
    "in fact , the structure of the near - surface regions of the stars is quite uncertain : there are still substantial ambiguity in modelling the convective flux , defining an appropriate equation of state to describe the thermodynamic properties of the stellar structure , as well as in the treatment of non - adiabatic effects .",
    "the conditions and limits of the applicability of the surface effect are still unknown and will be the subject of future studies .",
    "+ since there is no evidence for fast rotation , we exclude any possible effect on the frequencies due to magnetic activity .",
    "it was possible to determine the evolutionary state of this star through direct modelling , which places it in the hydrogen - shell - burning phase at the base of the ascending red - giant branch .",
    "this star is substantially less evolved than the red giants , whose @xmath58 gravity - mode period spacings were measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] where we see that the spacing of the g - dominated modes ( the upward sloping features ) is comparable to the p - mode spacing .",
    "this fact , together with the very strong mode bumping , makes it is quite hard to see a regular spacing in the l=1 modes of any single model .",
    "this makes it difficult to measure a clear g - mode period spacing .",
    "however , we see from the list of observed modes in table 3 that the consecutive @xmath58 modes have period spacings in the range 3550s , which is consistent with a hydrogen - shell - burning star @xcite . applying",
    "the method described by @xcite confirms a period spacing of about 40@xmath224s .",
    "figure [ oscsign ] shows that a weak oscillatory motion is present in the calculated frequencies for the acoustic modes which follow closely the asymptotic law , namely the radial modes and the non - radial modes with very low inertia .",
    "this oscillatory signal , as explained in sect .",
    "3.3 , is produced only by the region of the second ionization of helium , which induces a local minimum in the first adiabatic coefficient @xmath85 and hence a sharp variation in the sound speed .",
    "( black dots ) , @xmath58 ( blue triangles ) and @xmath71 ( red squares ) as calculated for model  1 of table [ t.6 ] . observed large separation and its errors @xmath86hz are indicated by dashed line and dotted lines respectively . ]",
    "figure [ gamma1 ] , which shows the behaviour of the first adiabatic coefficient as function of the acoustic radius @xmath87 , indicates that in the models of kic  4351319 the second helium ionization zone occurs at about @xmath88 , while the base of the convective envelope is located at @xmath89 , too deeply to produce an effective signal into the solar - like frequencies @xcite .",
    "the properties of the helium ionization zone , once determined from the oscillation frequencies , may be used to constrain the structure of the star , in particular the envelope helium abundance .",
    "further studies and developments are required in order to determine how a different content of he and a different equation of state for the computation of the models will result in a different oscillatory behaviour in the theoretical frequencies .    .",
    "the region where helium undergoes its second ionization corresponds to the second minimum in @xmath85 .",
    "the location of the base of the convective envelope is also indicated . ]    [ gamma1 ]    secondly , we have also considered the possibility to isolate the signal coming from the base of the convective envelope , by looking at the observed modes which penetrate deeply inside the star , namely the mixed modes with a high inertia .",
    "this can be studied following @xcite , by comparing models modified by adding turbulent diffusion or overshooting at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "the results have shown that the inclusion of turbulent diffusion , or overshooting , below the convective envelope produces a displacements only in the mixed modes for @xmath58 and @xmath71 modes , while all the other frequencies are not modified as shown in fig .",
    "[ echelle2 ] .",
    "thus , although we have not observed high - order g modes , we can still use the mixed modes to probe qualitatively the interior of this star .",
    "however , it is impossible to distinguish the effect on the frequencies due to the inclusion of diffusion from that of overshooting .",
    "[ echelle2 ]",
    "kic  4351319 has been observed for 30 days by the _ kepler _ satellite .",
    "these observations have yielded a clear detection of 25 modes identified with harmonic degrees @xmath90 between @xmath4 and @xmath5hz with a large separation @xmath0hz and a small separation @xmath1hz respectively .",
    "the oscillation spectrum of this star is characterized by the presence of a well defined solar - like oscillations pattern due to radial acoustic modes and non - radial nearly pure p modes equally spaced in frequencies .",
    "the nearly pure p modes have mixed gravity - pressure character with an inertia so low as to propagate up to the surface and appear to behave like solar - like oscillations , although they penetrate deeply to the core .",
    "the oscillation spectrum also showed evidence for the presence of mixed modes with strong gravity - mode character .",
    "those modes sound the internal region of this star and , besides constraining the stellar age , carry tight information about the location of the convective envelope and the condition in the core .",
    "this enabled to define characteristics of this star with an accuracy which can not be reached by the use of only the global asteroseismic parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus , in this paper we have addressed the problem of identifying the structural properties and the evolutionary state of kic  4351319 by using the results of the analysis of the oscillation spectrum and the atmospheric parameters provided by supplementary ground - based spectroscopic observations .",
    "detailed modelling of this star , in the attempt to match both the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints , allowed us to determine the main parameters with an unprecedent level of precision for a red - giant star , with uncertainties of @xmath9 for mass , @xmath10 for age , @xmath11 for radius , and @xmath12 for luminosity . in the end",
    ", we are able to conclude that this star is in the red - giant phase of the evolution , with a mass @xmath92 , an age of @xmath93  gyr , a radius @xmath68 and a luminosity @xmath69 .",
    "the uncertainties obtained for the stellar parameters come from the degeneracy of the models describing the stars in the red - giant phase of the evolution .",
    "only the detection of g modes , which better sound the condition of the core , could improve the results obtained by the present analyses , while strong theoretical efforts need to be done in order to achieve a better description of the stellar structure .",

    "according to this method , the p - mode parameters are estimated by finding the best fit between a modelled and the observational power density spectrum by using a maximum - likelihood technique @xcite .",
    "two different models have been assumed :      the fitting of the non - oversampled power spectrum has been done in two steps .",
    "first the background , for which we use a power law fit to account for long term effects , such as granulation , rotation or activity related to spots , is fitted .",
    "then , we computed a global maximum likelihood fit @xcite to all oscillation modes , where the final model @xmath94 is a convolution of the model with the power spectrum of the observed window function of the data set , normalised to unit total area ( see eq .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "this takes the redistribution of power caused by gaps in the data into account .",
    "@xmath95 in this model the previously determined background is kept fixed , while each of the @xmath96th oscillation peak is fitted with the height ( @xmath97 ) , the central frequency ( @xmath98 ) and hwhm ( @xmath99 ) and the noise level as free parameters .",
    "the selection of the oscillation modes is based on a statistical test of the binned power spectrum . for this test",
    "we bin the power spectrum over intervals of three frequency bins",
    ". then we compute the probability of the power in the binned power spectrum to be due to noise .",
    "this probability is computed using a @xmath29 distribution in which we take the width and number of the bins into account in the degrees of freedom .",
    "frequencies at which the probability of the power not being due to white noise is larger than 95% are selected as candidate oscillation frequencies . after performing the fit",
    ", we also verify that in the ratio of the observed to the fitted spectra no prominent peaks are left .",
    "therefore we compute the relative height for the investigated frequency range for which the probability of observing at least one spike with this height due to noise is 10% , following the formulation by @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ this is also described in @xcite .",
    "if the modes are resolved ( i.e. the mode width is larger than the frequency resolution ) we chose to model the oscillation spectrum by a sum of lorentzians plus a background model that counts for the signal which is not due to the p modes such as the instrumental noise or stellar background . in the frequency range considered here",
    ", the background has been modelled by a straight line ( i.e. @xmath100 ) . when the mode width is of the order of the frequency resolution we change the sum of lorentzians by a sum of sinc .",
    "the modelled power spectrum used to match the data is :    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the number of oscillation modes , @xmath45 the radial order , @xmath103 the fourier frequencies , and @xmath104 the background noise in the power spectrum , modelled as a straight line , i.e. @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , two constants and free parameters of the fit .",
    "@xmath108 is a lorentzian when the mode width is larger than the frequency resolution : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the height of the lorentzian profile , @xmath111 is the oscillation mode frequency and @xmath112 is the mode line width ( fwhm ) with @xmath113 , @xmath114 being the mode lifetime .    when the modes are not resolved , @xmath108 is a sinc function : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the total length of the observing run .",
    "the power spectrum is fitted `` globally '' over a frequency range corresponding to the detected excess power .",
    "the free parameters of the fitting process are :    * the height of the lorentzian profile , @xmath110 , @xmath45 being the radial order .",
    "a single height parameter is fitted per mode . * the frequency for each mode , @xmath111 . * the line width for each mode ( fwhm ) with @xmath117 ,",
    "@xmath118 being the mode lifetime .",
    "a single width has been considered . * the parameters @xmath119 describing the background model as mentioned above .",
    "the mode - parameter 1@xmath28 error bars are derived from the hessian matrix .",
    "no oversampling has been used in the computation of the power spectrum for the fitting procedure in order to minimize the correlation of the points .",
    "the degree of each mode is identified using chelle diagrams .",
    "the p - mode parameters are estimated by fitting a sequence of lorentzian profiles to the power density spectrum , where we use the previously determined stellar activity and granulation signal ( eq .",
    "4 without the gaussian ) as a fixed background .",
    "the visually identified mode profiles are parameterized by their central frequencies , mode heights , and lifetimes . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the mode profiles are quite narrow . to prevent the algorithm from over - fitting the data and to keep the number of free parameters to a reasonable amount we use two lifetime parameters , one for l=0 and 2 modes and one for l=1 modes .",
    "furthermore , we assume the individual mode heights to follow a gaussian envelope parameterized by a single central frequency and width but with individual heights for each mode degree .",
    "for the 25 modes in tab .",
    "3 , this results in a total of 32 free parameters . for the fit we use a bayesian mcmc algorithm @xcite that delivers probability density functions for all fitted parameters and their marginal distributions , from which we compute the most probable values and their 1@xmath28 uncertainties . during the fit",
    "the mode frequency parameters are allowed to vary independently within @xmath222@xmath61hz around the value inferred from a visual inspection of the spectrum .",
    "the lifetimes are kept between 1 and 50 days . whereas the centre and width of the gaussian envelope are kept within 0.9 and 1.1 times @xmath120 and @xmath28 ( eq.4 ) , respectively , the height for each mode degree is allowed to vary independently between 0 and 2 times the highest peak in power density spectrum ."
