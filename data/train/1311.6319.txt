    "the long standing problem of graviton mass @xcite has recently excited a renewed interest both at fundamental and cosmological level . from one side , massive gravitational states",
    "could be the signature of some effective theory quantization . from the other side , massive gravitons could be the natural candidates for dark matter capable of structuring self - gravitating astrophysical systems @xcite .    even though a quantum description of gravity has not been achieved yet @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to quantize gravity in the linear approximation of minkowskian limit .",
    "specifically , assuming general relativity ( gr ) as the theory of gravitational interaction , the quantization in this limit gives rise to spin-2 massless bosons , i.e. the massless gravitons . starting from this result , a reasonable question to ask",
    "is whether gravitons could be massive in some alternative theory of gravity where gr is only a limiting or a particular case @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of massive gravitons poses some controversial issues that greatly complicate the formulation of self - consistent theories , such as the presence of ghost , instabilities , discontinuity and strong coupling effects at low energy scales @xcite . in any case",
    ", massive graviton solutions can not be simply ruled out if one wants to face coherently the problem of gravitational interaction in the ultraviolet limit @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a large amount of alternative theories of gravity has been recently developed in order to match the problem of cosmic acceleration in view of dark energy @xcite . in all these approaches ,",
    "the problem of massive gravitons emerges and has to be consistently considered also at infrared limit @xcite .",
    "the original motivation is related to the observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch .",
    "this accelerated expansion may be due to the cosmological constant , to new weakly interacting fields constituting some kind of dark energy .",
    "the problem is that the dark energy scale appears to be smaller and smaller with respect to the energy scale of any known interactions .",
    "the unnatural smallness of dark energy density constitutes the cosmological constant problem . in this sense",
    ", infrared - modified gravity models could be phenomenologically relevant as a possible alternative to dark matter and dark energy whose effects at large scales could be originated by geometry , specifically by the further degrees of freedom emerging in alternative theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "based on the previous , as well as other , motivations , there have been several experimental searches for massive gravitons , resulting in upper limits for the mass which differ by several orders of magnitude . for example , a limit on the graviton mass ( @xmath2 ev ) has been achieved by measuring the decay of two photons @xcite . besides , assuming that clusters of galaxies are bound by more - or - less standard gravity , it is possible to obtain an upper limit of @xmath3 ev , where @xmath4 is the hubble constant in units of 100kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 @xcite .    on the other hand , gravitational waves sector has a prominent role in this discussion .",
    "gravitational waves coming from gr are described by the transverse - traceless gauge , which is a spin-@xmath6 tensor under rotations with massless modes . beside of these standard results , it is possible to construct consistent models where lorentz invariance is broken and the masses of scalar , vector and tensor perturbations are different from zero . a direct limit on the mass of graviton can be obtained from gravitational waves by binary stellar systems and from the inspiral rate inferred from the timing of binary pulsars",
    ". this bound is about @xmath7 ev for the binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "the same limit can be also obtained by studying binary systems in @xmath1-gravity @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the graviton mass upper limit of about @xmath8 ev , is obtained by considering the effect of gravitons on the power spectrum of weak lensing , with assumptions about dark energy and other parameters @xcite .    from a genuine theoretical point of view , the study of gravitons is challenging due to the problem of reconciling gravity and quantum field theories describing fundamental interactions .",
    "a bridge is represented by effective field theories ( eft ) , that allow to analyze different energy regimes separately ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in general , since the effective lagrangians is non - renormalizable , due to an infinite number of counterterms , one retains only a few of them , in a phenomenological approach where only leading terms are necessary .",
    "this means that the determination of the effective degrees of freedom is a crucial point for any effective theory and this fact is even more important in connection with gravity .",
    "technically , a way to build up an effective lagrangian is to identify some expansion parameters and classify terms in the lagrangian according to such parameters . without knowing the underlying fundamental theory , the coefficients of the expansion are necessarily unknown , and their values have to be determined , in principle , by experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we take into account an effective theory of gravity that follows naturally from extended theories of gravity ( etg ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the action can be expanded in powers of the ricci curvature scalar @xmath0 satisfying a massive klein gordon field equation .",
    "in particular , by linearizing @xmath1 gravity , the lagrangian describes a massive scalar field where a mass scale @xmath9 emerges naturally .",
    "the theory does not predict the value of this mass , but it does predict its connection with parameters of the etg lagrangian . it is possible to identify correlations between the coefficients of the effective lagrangioan , which may , in turn , induce correlations among observables at different scales .",
    "a first result is that the assumption of an effective lagrangian derived from @xmath1 gravity allows to escape the problem of scalar ghosts in massive theories , as pointed out in @xcite . in the limit where @xmath10 ( being @xmath11 the cosmological constant ) , we achieve a physically acceptable scalar field satisfying a homogeneous klein gordon equation and then one achieves an effective field lagrangian bypassing some of the problems raised in @xcite where gr , i.e. @xmath12 , was considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "is devoted to the construction of the field equations for analytical @xmath1 gravity models .",
    "here we put in evidence the main parameters of the theory defining an effective massive mode related to the further degrees of freedom coming from @xmath1 .",
    "the linearized theory is discussed in sec.3 .",
    "in particular , we derive and discuss the emergence of massive modes and how they contribute in the construction of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the effective lagrangian and its features are considered in sec .",

    "the only assumption at this stage is that @xmath1 is an analytic function ( _ i.e. _ taylor expandable ) in term of the ricci scalar , that is @xmath17 where we recover the flat - minkowski background as soon as @xmath18 and @xmath19 . here",

    "approach , from the point of view of unconstrained eft , there is no rationale , like symmetries or renormalizability , for choosing the gravitational action proportional to @xmath0 like in gr , except indications that the curvature @xmath0 is rather small .",
    "moreover , there are infinite terms allowed by general coordinate invariance , such as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the ricci tensor , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the riemann tensor , derivatives of @xmath0 , and so on . where one has to truncate the expansion is somehow a matter of choice , and the coefficients are completely unknown from a theoretical point of view . instead , the terms in the action follow from the underlying etg , which can also give indications on the coefficients and the order of the series . here",

    "we are working in planck units , therefore we assume that the lagrangian in action is multiplied by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the newton constant .",

    "we can neglect the non - homogeneous equation as soon as the condition r holds .",
    "let us study now the linearized version of such a theory in order to interpret it in the context of eft .",

    "on the other hand , the expansion in @xmath0 comes out naturally from the etg where the coefficients are fixed from the effective lagrangian .",
    "let us compare the effective lagrangian from linearized @xmath1 gravity eq . with a lagrangian derived on purely phenomenologically ground .",

    "the lagrangian @xmath82 describes an effective theory with two particles of 0-spin and 2-spin , as the lagrangian in eq . .",
    "it has been demonstrated that , when @xmath83 , the condition of null divergence of @xmath72 is not generally respected by the scalar field , resulting in negative energy , or indefinite metric , which are not physically acceptable @xcite . in order to recover null divergence , the coefficients and the masses of eq .",
    "need to respect fixed relations among them .",
    "it is not obvious to build sensible descriptions of the gravitational interaction with this characteristic .",
    "a standard way is to use the hilbert - einstein action for the massless gravitational field together with mass terms respecting the symmetries leading to the correct ward identities . in @xcite",
    ", it is observed that such mass terms do not respect the relations necessary to a physically acceptable lagrangian @xmath82 , and we are forced to conclude that this description of massive gravity is not satisfactory .    in our case",
    ", the effective lagrangian evades the condition @xmath83 assumed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the lagrangian contains , at leading order , only terms proportional to powers of @xmath72 , which correspond to @xmath84 .",
    "additional contributions are suppressed by @xmath11 , in the limit @xmath65 , which is the same limit where dynamics of the scalar is described by the physical klein gordon equation . in other words , we can say that starting from an analytical @xmath1 gravity model , it is quite natural to recover an eft where massive modes emerge at scalar and tensor levels .",
    "the issue of the consistency of a field theory for massive gravitons can be settled by extending the einstein gravity through generic functions of curvature invariants .",
    "the minimal extension is @xmath1 gravity where the standard hilbert - einstein action , linear in the ricci scalar @xmath0 is substituted by a generic function . from a dynamical viewpoint , this means that further degrees of freedom of gravitational field have to be taken into account and the possibility of massive gravitons naturally comes out , at least , as massive scalar modes .    in this paper , we have confronted the principal features of the lagrangian resulting from the linearization of @xmath1 gravity with the ones of the effective phenomenological lagrangian previously discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main result is that it is possible to obtain massive terms which indeed emerge naturally if one breaks spontaneously the diffeomorphism invariance of gr , and , in this case , for a certain interval of parameters , it is possible to evade ghosts and discontinuities .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to identify a natural mass scale @xmath9 directly related to the expansion parameters of the theory .",
    "this fact could avoid to fix _ by hand _ the graviton mass since it comes directly from the structure of the theory .",
    "upper limits ( or mass ranges ) could directly come by experimental constraints ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in the limit @xmath10 ( or the less restrictive one @xmath85 ) , the theory results naturally regularized and the massive scalar satisfies a physically acceptable klein gordon equation . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will extend this approach to more general theories involving also the other curvature invariants .",
