    "potentials which oscillate rapidly relative to the motion of particles inside them are widely used to trap charged and neutral particles .",
    "most notably , this is because rapidly oscillating potentials ( rops ) allow trapping in cases where static potentials can not .",
    "well - known paradigms are the paul - trap for charged particles  @xcite and the electro- and magneto - dynamic traps for high - field seeking polar molecules  @xcite and neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rops allow the realization of complicated trap geometries .",
    "prime examples are the top - trap  @xcite , the optical billiard traps  @xcite and rapidly scanning optical tweezers  @xcite for ultracold neutral atoms or even microparticles such as polymers and cells  @xcite .",
    "another reason is that the description of the motion of particles in a rop  as compared to other time - varying potentials  is very simple : the particles _ mean_-motion ( averaged over the rop s fast oscillations ) is to a good approximation determined by a static _ effective _ potential  @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations for the classical regime show that in rops with a vanishing time - average , as e.g.  the paul - trap , the mean - motion of trapped particles is strongly coupled to the phase of the rop  @xcite .",

    "particles are trapped in rops  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if this tool would work for quantum particles : in the paul - trap , a classical particle which does not move is not affected by a phase hop  @xcite .",
    "thus , the same might be true for a quantum particle in , e.g. , the ground state of the effective trapping potential .    in this article",
    ", we derive an independent quantum mechanical treatment of the effect of phase hops on a particle trapped by a rop of arbitrary shape . by both analytical and numerical calculations",
    "we show that a phase hop can strongly influence the particle s mean - motion , even if it is in the ground state of the effective trapping potential . the experimental ability to prepare single  @xcite and ensembles  @xcite of quantum particles in rops in specific states would allow to apply this tool in a controlled fashion .    the model used to describe both the time - dependent and the effective system is given in sec .",

    "thus the equation of motion for the particle s mean - motion wave function remains unchanged .",
    "however , the mean - motion wave function itself changes due to the natural continuity of the particle s real wave function at @xmath47 : for @xmath48 the latter is a product of a phase factor and the mean - motion wave function ( eq .

    "this difference is a direct consequence of heisenberg s uncertainty principle which implies that in the quantum regime the particle s mean - position is spread around zero , leading  contrarily to the classical regime  to a non - vanishing micromotion ( since @xmath68 for @xmath69 ) , thus giving rise to an effect of the phase hop .",

    "an intuitive explanation of the very fact that in rops with a vanishing time - average a phase hop can always significantly change the particle s mean - energy ( when it is induced in a correct moment ) , can be given as follows : for rops with a vanishing time - average the particle s mean potential energy equals the average kinetic energy that is stored in the particle s micromotion ( since @xmath95 ) .",
