    "to understand protein function , it is often essential to characterize large conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding . within the population - shift mechanism of allosteric conformational change,@xcite the bound complex is formed when a ligand selects and stabilizes a weakly populated conformational ensemble from the kinetically accessible states of the unbound folded protein .",
    "consequently , the kinetics of large scale conformational transitions between two meta - stable states are determined largely by the inherent conformational dynamics within the folded state free energy basin .",
    "such conformational dynamics imply an inherent flexibility or `` intrinsic plasticity '' of the folded state . in this paper",
    ", we focus on how this inherent flexibility of a protein molecule influences the mechanism controlling the kinetics of allosteric transitions .",
    "there are a couple of possible scenarios for the transition mechanism in terms of changes in conformational flexibility .",
    "one possibility is that the flexibility adjusts smoothly to the conformation deformation between two specific meta - stable states in the free energy surface . in this case",
    ", the inherent flexibility of the protein remains relatively constant if the meta - stable states have similar flexibilities or else changes smoothly between the flexibilities of the meta - stable states if the flexibilities are different .",
    "another possible mechanism , called `` cracking'',@xcite has recently been proposed as an alternative mechanism that may be important in some conformational transitions . in terms of conformational flexibility ,",
    "cracking involves non - monotonic changes in flexibility along the transitions route .",
    "in particular , the flexibility of specific regions of the protein may transiently increase through local unfolding . as explained in ref .",
    ", local unfolding can relieve specific areas of high stress during conformational deformations that would result in high free energy barriers if the protein remained uniformly folded throughout the transition .    in the model developed to explore this idea ,",
    "cracking is introduced directly into the formalism as means to incorporate nonlinear elasticity in an otherwise harmonic description of conformational fluctuations ( i.e. , normal modes ) .",
    "@xcite this work clearly shows that local unfolding can dramatically lower predicted free energy barriers between local free energy minima and hence facilitates faster kinetics .",
    "in contrast , the variational model developed in the present work does not assume cracking from the outset .",
    "the evidence of cracking here arises entirely from the analysis of the local changes in flexibility along transition routes predicted by an inherently non - linear model of conformational transitions .",
    "our results are thus an independent verification of the ideas and formalism developed in the model presented in ref",
    "..    cracking does not occur in all conformational transitions , but even when it does , the average conformations of the local minima in the free energy may show little signs that local unfolding is involved.@xcite instead , cracking is a subtle consequence of the nature of the conformational deformation required to connect the two states .",
    "since cracking is akin to folding of the whole protein albeit on a constrained and local scale , it is reasonable to ask if some insight appropriated from the success of the energy landscape theory of protein folding@xcite can help to anticipate when cracking is likely to be important in conformational transitions between two distinct folded conformations .",
    "one motivation for the work in this paper is to investigate if the cracking mechanism of conformational transitions , like the mechanism for folding of two state proteins,@xcite is determined by structural topology of the two meta - stable states . to address this question we study the conformational transitions of the open and closed conformations of the two homologous domains of calmodulin ( cam ) as well as a fragment of cam involving parts of both domains . aside from general theoretical implications ,",
    "the results presented in this paper are interesting from the point of view of understanding the well - known and intensely studied thermodynamic differences between the two domains of cam.@xcite    our approach is based on a coarse - grained variational model previously developed to characterize protein folding .",
    "@xcite this model is in harmony with several recent coarse - grained simulations based on a folded - state biased interaction potential that interpolates between the contact maps of the meta - stable states .",
    "@xcite interestingly some of these recently proposed coarse - grained model for protein conformational transition can also capture the cracking or local partial unfolding during transition  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compare the detailed predicted transition routes for the open / closed conformational change of the c - terminal domain of calmodulin ( ccam ) with that of the n - terminal domain of cam ( ncam ) .",
    "the open and closed state of each domain is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cam_domains](a  b ) .",
    "we find that although the ncam and ccam have similar structures , the calculated transition routes predict that the cracking is essential only in ccam .",
    "it is well established that the two domains differ in flexibility as well as binding affinity for ca@xmath0.@xcite these properties are not determined by topology ( since they are the same ) but ultimately by more subtle structural differences encoded in the sequence of the two domains .",
    "our results suggest that ncam is flexible enough that cracking is not necessary to relieve stress during the conformational change , while the ccam is relatively rigid so that cracking is involved in essentially the same conformational change .",
    "in addition , we investigate the conflicting ca@xmath0 binding mechanism in the  odd - even \" and  even - odd \" paired ef - hands between the two domains of cam [ shown in fig .",
