    "the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) _",
    "@xcite is a solar satellite launched by nasa on february 11 2010 .",
    "the scientific goal of this mission is a better understanding of how the solar magnetic field is generated and structured and how solar magnetic energy is stored and released into the helio- and geo - sphere , thus influencing space weather .",
    "_ sdo _ contains a suite of three instruments :    * the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager ( sdo / hmi ) _",
    "@xcite has been designed to study oscillations and the magnetic field at the solar photosphere . *",
    "the _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( sdo / aia ) _",
    "@xcite is made of four telescopes , providing ten full - sun images every twelve seconds , twenty four hours a day , seven days a week .",
    "* the _ extreme ultraviolet variability experiment ( sdo / eve ) _",
    "@xcite measures the solar extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) irradiance with unprecedented spectral resolution , temporal cadence , accuracy , and precision .    the present paper deals with an important aspect of the image reconstruction problem for _ sdo / aia _ @xcite .",
    "the four telescopes of such instrument capture images of the sun s atmosphere in ten separate wave bands , seven of which centered at euv wavelengths .",
    "each image is a @xmath2 square array with pixel width in the range @xmath3 arcsec and is acquired according to a standard ccd - based imaging technique .",
    "in fact , each _ aia _ telescope utilizes a @xmath4-megapixel ccd divided into four @xmath5 quadrants .",
    "as typically happens in this kind of imaging , _ aia _ ccds are affected by primary saturation and blooming , which degrade both quantitatively and qualitatively the _ aia _ imaging properties . _",
    "primary saturation _",
    "@xcite refers to the condition where a set of pixel cells reaches the full well capacity , i.e. these pixels store the maximum number possible of photon - induced electrons . at saturation ,",
    "pixels lose their ability to accommodate additional charge , which therefore spreads into neighboring pixels , causing either erroneous measurements or second - order saturation . such spread of charge",
    "is named _ blooming _",
    "@xcite and typically shows up as a bright artifact along a privileged axis in the image .",
    "figure [ fig : saturation - blooming ] shows a notable example of combined saturation and blooming effects in an _ sdo / aia _ image captured during the september 6 , 2011 event .",
    "the recovery of information in the primary saturation region by means of an inverse diffraction procedure is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "further , we also introduce here an interpolation approach that allows a robust estimate of the background in the diffraction region as well as reasonable estimate of the flux in the central blooming region .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "_ sdo / aia _ images are strongly affected by both primary saturation and blooming , that may occur at all different wavelengths and acquisition times , even in the case of flaring events characterized by a moderate peak flux .",
    "this paper describes the first mathematical description of a robust method for the de - saturation of such images at both a primary and secondary ( blooming ) level .",
    "the method relies on the description of de - saturation in terms of inverse diffraction and utilizes correlation and expectation - maximization for the recovery of information in the primarily saturated region .",
    "this approach requires to compute a reliable estimate of the image background which , for this paper , has been obtained by means of interpolation in the fourier space .",
    "the knowledge of the background permits to recover information in the blooming region in a very natural way .",
    "the availability of an automatic procedure for image de - saturation in the _ sdo / aia _ framework may potentially change the extent with which euv information from the sun can be exploited .",
    "in fact , armed with our computational approach , many novel problems can be addressed in _",
    "sdo / aia _ imaging .",
    "for example , one can study the impact of the choice of the model for the diffraction psf on the quality of the de - saturation . in this paper",
    "we used a synthetic estimate of the diffraction psf provided by solar software ( ssw ) but other empirical or semi - empirical forms can be adopted .",
    "furthermore , this technique can be extended to account for the dependance of the psf from the passband wavelengths .",
    "finally , the routine implementing this approach is fully automated and this allows the systematic analysis of many events recorded by _ aia _ and their integration with data provided by other missions such as _ rhessi _ @xcite or , in the near future _ stix _ @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by a grant of the italian indam - gncs and by the nasa grant nnx14ag06 g .",
    "the _ sdo / aia _ hardware is equipped with a feedback system that reacts to saturation in correspondence of intense emissions by reducing the exposure time . as a result , for a typical _ aia _ acquisition along a time range of some minutes , during which saturation occurs , the telescope always provides some unsaturated frames that can be utilized to estimate the background . a possible way to realize such an estimate",
    "is based on the following scheme .",
    "let us denote with @xmath6 and @xmath7 two unsaturated images acquired at times @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively and with @xmath10 a saturated image acquired at @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( note that @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and @xmath7 are normalized at the same exposure time ) .",
    "the algorithm for the estimate of the background is :    1 .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are deconvolved with em ( using the global psf ) to obtain the reconstructions @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the kl - kkt rule can be used to stop the iterations ) .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are fourier transformed by means of a standard fft - based procedure to obtain @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a low - pass filter is applied to both @xmath15 and @xmath16 to obtain @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "4 .   for each corresponding pair of pixels in @xmath17 and @xmath18 that are not negligible , an interpolation routine",
    "is applied , both for the real and imaginary part .",
    "this provides @xmath19 in correspondence of @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting vector @xmath21 is fourier inverted to obtain the interpolated reconstruction @xmath22 .",
    "the core psf @xmath23 is finally applied to @xmath22 to obtain @xmath24 in the image domain .",
    "@xmath24 is a reliable estimate , for time @xmath11 , of the background @xmath25 introduced in section 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "a reliable estimate of the image in the bloomed region is provided by the restriction @xmath26 of @xmath24 onto @xmath27 determined as in section 2 .",
    "we finally observe that , in this algorithm , the interpolation step is applied in the fourier domain because , after filtering , a lot of pixels are negligible and therefore the computational burden of the procedure is notably decreased .",
