    "the transition from a confined phase with broken chiral symmetry to a deconfined chirally symmetric phase is an important subject for studies of finite temperature quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this transition is relevant for the evolution of the early universe and reproduced in current heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "it can be investigated non - perturbatively using lattice qcd as long as the chemical potential for fermion number is small , @xmath3 .",
    "a lot of effort has been invested in lattice studies at zero chemical potential , for recent reviews see  @xcite .",
    "impressive progress has been reported very recently by several collaborations working with different fermion discretization schemes @xcite .",
    "in particular , lattice qcd with staggered fermions and physical quark masses does not predict a true phase transition but an analytic crossover in the limit of zero chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "similarly , results on the transition temperature and the equation of state have predominantly been obtained from simulations with staggered fermions  @xcite . however ,",
    "this fermion discretization is subject to an on - going debate and there is no formal proof that its continuum limit will reproduce the universality class of qcd  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to obtain independent results with other discretizations , in order to have some mutual control over systematic errors .",
    "unfortunately , wilson - type fermions ( and even more so chiral fermion formulations ) require higher computational costs .",
    "it is thus expedient to study the nature of the phase transition for various larger than physical quark masses and to extrapolate to the physical situation .",
    "moreover , knowing global properties of the phase transition as a function of the light quark masses constrains the enlarged phase diagram including the strange quark and non - vanishing chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "an as yet unsettled crucial question in this context is the nature of the phase transition in the two - flavor chiral limit .",
    "most studies favor a second order transition in the @xmath2 universality class  @xcite but there are also claims for a first order transition  @xcite .",
    "since in the continuum and chiral limits the transition is associated with the breaking of a global chiral symmetry , it is necessarily a true and non - analytic phase transition and one of these scenarios has to be realized  @xcite , while an analytic crossover is ruled out . on the other hand , for moderate and intermediate quark masses",
    ", the transition is an analytic crossover , before it turns into a first - order deconfinement transition for very heavy quarks .    in this article",
    "we study the thermal transition with two degenerate flavors of maximally twisted mass fermions , which provide an @xmath4-improved wilson fermion discretization , for a review see  @xcite . as a first step we focus on the determination of the phase boundary , i.e.  the pseudo - critical temperatures @xmath5 using the polyakov loop , the chiral condensate and the plaquette as observables .",
    "we do this for a set of pion masses , @xmath6 mev , and attempt various extrapolations to the @xmath7 chiral limit .",
    "similar efforts were recently under way employing clover improved fermions  @xcite .",
    "the following section serves to specify our simulation setup . in section  [ sec : temperature ]",
    "we introduce the observables and collect the pseudo - critical couplings from our simulations .",
    "these results allow for an estimate of the size of the discretization errors present in our simulations .",
    "in section  [ sec : chiral ] we use these pseudo - critical points for an extrapolation to the chiral limit . we discuss possibilities and limitations in discerning the order of the chiral phase transition .",
    "finally section  [ sec : concl ] gives some conclusions and an outlook .",
    "we consider qcd with a mass - degenerate doublet of twisted mass fermions , cf .  the review by shindler  @xcite .",
    "the gauge action is tree - level symanzik improved while the fermion action is @xmath8 = \\sum_x { \\ensuremath{\\overline\\chi}}(x)\\left ( 1 -\\kappa d_w[u ] +                       2{\\ensuremath{\\text{i}}}\\kappa a\\mu_0 \\gamma_5\\tau^3\\right)\\chi(x)\\;.\\ ] ] the fermion fields are written in the twisted basis @xmath9 which is commonly used for numerical simulations .",
    "it is connected to the basis of physical fields @xmath10 for the relevant case of maximal twist via @xmath11 the quark mass is determined by the hopping parameter @xmath12 , which parameterizes the untwisted bare quark mass component , @xmath13 and the twisted mass parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the wilson covariant derivative is given by @xmath15\\psi(x ) = \\sum_\\mu \\left ( \\left(r-\\gamma_\\mu\\right ) u_\\mu(x)\\psi(x+\\hat\\mu ) \\right .   \\\\",

    "gets corrections through mass renormalization .",
    "the overall renormalized quark mass @xmath19 is composed of the twisted and untwisted masses as @xmath20    at maximal twist , the above fermion formulation is automatically @xmath4-improved , i.e.  cutoff effects linear in the lattice spacing @xmath1 are absent for non - zero physical observables .",
    "maximal twist is achieved by tuning the hopping parameter to its critical value @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 , where the untwisted theory would feature massless pions .",
    "the required knowledge of @xmath23 ) , as well as other input needed from zero temperature simulations in order to set the scale , can be interpolated from data by the european twisted mass collaboration ( etmc )  @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : interpol : kc ] and [ fig : interpol : a ] we show our interpolations for @xmath24 and the lattice spacing @xmath25 .",
    "our numerical evaluation proceeds by an hmc algorithm @xcite within the publicly available code for qcd with twisted mass fermions @xcite .",
    "wilson fermions are well - known to feature unphysical phases for light quarks and coarse lattice spacings . like the physical parameter space ,",
    "these get extended to a third direction because of the additional twisted mass parameter in the current formulation . in order to stay away from unphysical regions , knowledge of the bare parameter phase diagram",
    "is required , which we have mapped out earlier in a preparatory study  @xcite .",
    "status reports of our ongoing project have been given at the annual lattice conferences  @xcite .",
    "the temperature scale is set by the temporal lattice extent and the lattice spacing , @xmath26 . in order to locate the phase boundary between the hadronic region and the quark gluon plasma",
    ", we perform scans in the lattice gauge coupling @xmath27 , which thus corresponds to a change in temperature of the lattice system .",
    "table [ tab : runs ] gives the list of runs for different pion masses and the naming scheme that we have adopted for the sake of simplicity . to adjust the masses",
    ", etmc provides parameters for nnlo@xmath28-formulae at their values of @xmath29 which can be used to identify the relation @xmath30 at those couplings . for our @xmath31 scans we have relied on the one - loop scaling relation @xmath32 with @xmath33 and fixing the free parameter @xmath34 at one of the available couplings",
    "we have found this relation to work sufficiently well to create lines of constant pion mass within the errors quoted in table[tab : runs ] .",

    "we have presented a ( revised ) first investigation of the two - flavor thermal qcd transition with maximally twisted mass fermions .",
    "our results are compatible with existing work although , of course , staggered investigations are much more advanced  @xcite .",
    "the quality of our signals is comparable to recent results with clover improved wilson fermions  @xcite .    for three pion masses in the range @xmath40",
    "we have determined pseudo - critical temperatures for the crossover from the hadronic regime to the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the pseudo - critical temperatures - extracted for the two higher mass values - from observables related to chiral and deconfinement transitions , respectively , turned out to be different .",
    "discretization effects in @xmath41 appeared to be small for our lattice spacings , @xmath42 fm .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to pion masses @xmath43mev in order to assure the validity of lo@xmath28 as well as the scaling forms in order to extrapolate to the chiral limit .",
    "assuming the scaling forms appropriate for different universality classes , such extrapolations gave critical temperatures in the range @xmath44 mev consistent with other studies .",
    "however , detailed fitting analyses demonstrated that the second order @xmath2 scaling regime is not yet reached .",
    "scaling violations could be accomodated by leading order corrections due to finite - mass effects up to @xmath45 mev , while heavier masses violate even those corrections . by including higher order violation effects reasonable fits",
    "could be achieved with @xmath46 values consistent with the other determinations .",
    "we find that truly distinguishing between the different universality classes and thus ruling out a first order scenario will require much smaller pion masses , @xmath47 as well as finite - size scaling analyses .",
