    "disordered solids made of molecules ( glasses ) , microscale particles , droplets , or gas bubbles in fluid ( colloidal glasses , emulsions , and foams ) , or solid macroscopic particles in air ( granular materials ) can be fluidized by raising temperature or kinetic energy , decreasing density or packing fraction , or applying a mechanical load such as a shear stress .",

    "the result depends only weakly on @xmath15 over the range studied .",
    "thus , while viscosity can be used as a proxy for relaxation time for repulsive spheres at a given fixed pressure , care must be taken in comparing @xmath71 to @xmath11 if the pressure is varying .    the near - collapse shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etatau](b ) implies that up to relatively high shear stresses , the hard sphere fluid behaves like a maxwell fluid with a relaxation time that decreases with shear stress but a modulus @xmath72 that is independent of shear stress and proportional to the pressure .",

    "however , the downwards slope of the contours of equal @xmath62 in fig .  [ fig : jpd](a ) is more generic ; it reflects the fact that at fixed @xmath15 , the dimensionless relaxation time decreases with increasing @xmath21 . as the potential softens or the pressure increases at fixed @xmath15 , the amount of overlap increases . as a result ,",

    "notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : jpd](a ) that the contours become more closely spaced as @xmath15 decreases .",

    "we restrict ourselves to values of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 to avoid the artifactual layering due to shear discussed in sec .",
    "since we must interpolate to find the level sets of dimensionless relaxation time , it would be computationally expensive to construct entire surfaces .",
    "instead , we draw contours where the surfaces intersect four planes : the equilibrium plane at @xmath75 , the hard sphere plane at @xmath21 , a plane at @xmath86 , and a plane at @xmath87 .    the diagram in fig .  [",

    "we have shown contours for three values of @xmath62 , separated by decades .",
    "the jamming surface for our system is given by the smallest surface closest to the origin and corresponds to @xmath90 ; this is where we can no longer reach equilibrium on the time scale of our simulations .",
    "as expected , the dimensionless relaxation time increases monotonically as any combination of the three control variables @xmath82 is reduced .",
    "the contours become more closely spaced as @xmath15 , @xmath6 , or @xmath21 decrease , signaling the rapid increase of relaxation time as the system approaches jamming .",
    "the jamming surface intersects the unstressed plane ( @xmath75 ) along a curve defined by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the dimensionless dynamic glass transition temperature .",
    "this temperature depends on pressure , and decreases with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "however , recent results indicate that the relaxation time of soft spheres can be mapped onto the relaxation time for hard spheres by approximating the soft sphere potential by a hard sphere potential with a smaller effective diameter  @xcite",

    "[ fig : jpd](d ) , can be mapped onto the approach for hard spheres , the purple arrow of fig .",

    "this implies that the physics of the hard - sphere glass transition governs the glass transition of all finite - range repulsive spheres .    at nonzero shear stress",
    ", the jamming surface defines what could be considered either a stress - dependent dynamic glass transition temperature or a temperature - dependent dynamic yield stress @xmath94 . for the hard - sphere system at @xmath74 , there is a nonzero dynamic yield stress for @xmath95 , where @xmath96 marks the dynamic glass transition for unstressed hard spheres . at all pressures",
    ", the contours of constant relaxation time @xmath62 must be quadratic in @xmath6 at small @xmath6 .",
    "this is expected from symmetry ; the magnitude of the glass transition temperature should not depend on the sign of the shear stress .",
    "thus , if the shape of the dynamic yield stress curve for hard spheres is given by @xmath97 , then @xmath98 for small @xmath30 .",
    "a similar shape has been observed for contours of equal viscosity for a model metallic glass - forming liquid  @xcite .",
    "now consider the low temperature limit , @xmath99 . in this limit , the shear stress @xmath6 appears to saturate at a nonzero value set by the zero - temperature dynamic yield stress @xmath100 whose value depends on pressure : @xmath101 , where @xmath102 . in the hard - sphere limit , where @xmath18 , the low - temperature system has a nonzero dynamic yield stress ( fig .",

    "thus , at low values of @xmath21 for soft spheres , the athermal dynamic yield stress @xmath100 must scale with pressure : @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "this is consistent with granular experiments and simulations that find a macroscopic dynamic friction coefficient in the limit of low strain rate  @xcite .",
    "we may use the jamming phase diagram to characterize other dimensionless observables besides @xmath62 , such as the packing fraction @xmath1 , as functions of the dimensionless control parameters @xmath82 .",
    "for example , in the fluid region each value of @xmath82 corresponds to a certain value of the packing fraction ; this is the equation of state .",

    "the effective coordination number and vibrational properties of the system along the path described by the green arrow at @xmath93 can be mapped onto those along the red arrow at @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the short - time - scale properties of repulsive spheres along any path that approaches the origin of the jamming phase diagram , such as the paths described by the white arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : jpd](d ) , are controlled by the same physics .",
    "however , in the jammed region the value of the packing fraction at a given state point @xmath82 is not given by an equation of state but becomes history dependent .",
    "for example , if @xmath15 is decreased slowly at @xmath111 , then the resulting value of @xmath1 may be higher than if @xmath15 were decreased quickly to the same final value .",
    "the equation of state becomes multi - valued ; at least one extra parameter , for instance the packing fraction , must be specified in order to determine the state of the system . within the mean - field theory of random first - order models ,",
    "glass states are uniquely determined by the jamming state diagram obtained by adding one more parameter to the jamming phase diagram  @xcite , but in general the state of the glass may depend in more detail on the history .    note that because the jammed state is history - dependent ,",
