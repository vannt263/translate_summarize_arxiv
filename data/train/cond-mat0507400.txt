    "the scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images of these zno nanohelices show that each helical period is formed by the sequence of six straight blocks , each block growing in a given crystalline direction .    as up",
    "to now experimentalists have not reported the growth of amorphous nanosprings of the _ normal _ type , we here present the results of our investigation towards answering the question : _ is it possible to grow amorphous nanosprings of the normal type  ? _    according to our previous analysis  @xcite , amorphous nanosprings grown by the vls mechanism are dynamically stable .",
    "this stability stems from the intrinsic curvature produced by the catalytic particle in the forming nanospring .",
    "the _ intrinsic curvature _ of a rod represents its tridimensional shape when it is free from external stresses .",
    "goriely and shipman have studied the dynamical stability of _ normal _ and _ binormal _ helices  @xcite and showed that intrinsically _",
    "normal _ or _ binormal _ helical filaments are always stable . therefore , from the mechanical point of view , and in agreement with our previous analysis  @xcite , there is no mechanical prohibition for the existence of an amorphous _ normal _ nanospring , thus both types of helical amorphous nanostructures could be produced by the usual vls mechanism .",
    "we have conjectured that the shape of the liquid catalyst is the key to explain the absence of normal amorphous nanospring .",
    "thus we have extended the vls growth model to address also the case of non - spherical liquid catalyst .",
    "according to the vls growth model , a liquid droplet of metal absorbs the material from the surrounding vapor , and after super - saturation of the absorbed material within the droplet , the excess material precipitates at the liquid - solid interface forming the nanowire beneath the metallic catalyst .",
    "the model is based on the interaction between the surface tension of the liquid - vapor ( @xmath13 ) , solid - vapor ( @xmath14 ) and solid - liquid ( @xmath15 ) interfaces .",
    "@xcite proposed that the helical growth process occurs due to a contact angle anisotropy ( caa ) at the catalyst - nanowire interface .",
    "the trajectory of the metallic catalyst is driven by the work needed to shear it from the surface of the nanowire .",
    "this work is called the thermodynamic work of adhesion @xmath16 and can be computed in terms of the surface tensions by  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angle between the surface tensions @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] reproduces the schematic diagram of a spherical catalyst placed asymmetrically on the nanowire , in accordance to the mcilroy _",
    "et al _ modified vls growth model  @xcite .",
    "atop a nanowire of radius @xmath19 , whose center is shifted of @xmath20 with respect to the axis of the nanowire.,width=188,height=222 ]    figures [ fig1]b ) and [ fig1]c ) display the cross - section of _ normal _ and _ binormal _ helical structures , respectively .",
    "we can see in these figures that , with respect to the plane of the page , the cross - section of the _ normal _ helix has a horizontal dimension larger than the vertical one , and vice - versa for the _ binormal _ helix .",
    "the nanowire grows from the deposition of the material absorbed by the liquid catalyst , so that , to grow structures with asymmetric cross - section , the surface of contact between the catalytic particle and the nanowire must follow the shape pattern of the cross - section .    an increase of the diameter of the spherical catalyst in the anisotropic position with respect to the nanowire axis ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , without increasing the nanowire diameter , increases the asymmetry of the surface of contact between the catalyst and the nanowire .",
    "however , according to mcilroy _",
    "@xcite , if the diameter of the spherical catalyst increases systematically , so that @xmath21 decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , the caa becomes less significant and the work of adhesion becomes equal to that of the symmetric configuration in which the nanowire grows linearly .",
    "therefore , to have the surface of contact between the catalyst and the nanowire following the pattern of a nanospring of asymmetric cross - section , in the model considered by mcilroy _",

    "[ fig3 ] , is obtained in the same way as that driven by a spherical catalyst ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) : the growth rate velocity is larger at the interface where the work of adhesion is smaller  @xcite .",
    "of course , in the case of growth of an asymmetric nanospring the shape of the interface of contact between the catalyst and the nanowire is not circular .     with respect to the axis of the nanowire .",

    "all of these figures display remnants of the catalyst inside the transition region . in ref .",
    "@xcite these remnants are assumed to have spherical shape .",

    "the shape of the particle inside the transition from linear to helical sic nanowire displayed in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite has a more complex shape .",
    "according to mcilroy _",
    "@xcite , changes in the materials absorbed by the catalyst , the introduction of additional elements , and changes in the local temperature can introduce imbalances in the energy related to the surface tension of the liquid - vapor ( @xmath13 ) , solid - vapor ( @xmath14 ) and solid - liquid ( @xmath15 ) interfaces , that lead to variations in the shape and mass of the catalyst during the growth process of the nanowire .",
    "therefore , we propose that after the transition from linear to helical growth of the nanowire , the ejected part of the catalyst has to possess an asymmetric shape to drive the growth of a nanospring with asymmetric cross - section .",
    "the idea of considering non - spherical catalyst is essential for explaining the formation of a nanospring with asymmetric cross - section .",
    "now , to explain why amorphous _",
    "normal _ nanosprings have not been synthesized we have to look into the contact angle anisotropy ( caa )  @xcite . according to mcilroy _",
    "et al _ proposal  @xcite , the caa has to be significant for the helical growth of a nanowire .",
    "so , if the caa is significant for the growth of _ normal _ and _ binormal _ nanosprings , then both types of nanosprings could be grown through the vls mechanism . to explain the absence of amorphous _",

    "[ fig2 ] ) , the caa becomes less significant and the work of adhesion becomes equal to that of the symmetric configuration in which the nanowire grows linearly .",
    "as we are dealing with non - spherical catalyst we propose that the significance of the caa comes from the ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the dimension of the catalyst particle along the direction of the shift of the catalyst with respect to the nanowire axis . in the case of a spherical catalyst of radius @xmath25 , @xmath26 , giving mcilroy _",
