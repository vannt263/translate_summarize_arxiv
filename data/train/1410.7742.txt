    "in what sense does the random group resemble @xmath0 ?    the proof of theorem [ t - randomization autf2 ] relies on giving an answer to this question which is precise enough to keep track of the ( dis)appearance of ( periodic ) flat planes in the random groups .",
    "the text is centered around geometric structures called `` ring puzzles '' and `` ring complexes '' , which are defined precisely in [ s - ring puzzles ] and [ s - nonplanar ] respectively .",
    "ring puzzles are tessellations of the euclidean plane with constraints on the set of tiles and vertex neighbourhoods ( see [ s - ring puzzles ] ) . associated with @xmath0 are ring puzzles , called @xmath0 puzzles , with two tiles and three types of neighbourhoods .",
    "the definition is elementary involving simple local construction rules that are not directly reminiscent of @xmath0 .",
    "incidentally , ring puzzles give informative `` snapshots '' of the geometry of @xmath0 itself .",
    "it is known that @xmath0 acts properly with compact quotient on a 2-dimensional cat(0 ) space called the brady complex , which is essentially uniquely determined , by results of crisp and paoluzzi @xcite .",
    "the space of @xmath0 puzzles is related to the space of flats in the brady complex or in any ring complex of type @xmath0 . in the case of",
    "the brady complex itself , the space of flat surjects onto the space of puzzles , which is an indication that @xmath0 plays the role of `` space of maximal rank '' in rank interpolation @xcite .    the main objective in [ s - ring puzzles ] , and the first step in the proof of theorem [ t - randomization autf2 ] , is to show that :    there is an explicit classification of all @xmath0 puzzles .",
    "the classification finds :    * 4 infinite families of puzzles * 9 exceptional puzzles not belonging to the families    see theorem [ t - puzzle classification ] for a detailed statement .",
    "( large portions of a puzzle do not determine the puzzle in general , puzzles are `` bifurcating spaces '' with an interesting ( pointed ) gromov  hausdorff topology ; see remark [ r - marked puzzles ] . )",
    "ring complexes are defined in [ s - nonplanar ] as metric simplicial complexes subjects to `` ring conditions '' on the links .",
    "compared to classical curvature conditions ( the girth condition in dimension 2 ) , the ring conditions serve to control the local flatness and shed light on the `` intermediate rank '' structure of @xmath0 rather than the curvature .",
    "local rules identical to that of @xmath0 puzzles give rise to ring complexes of type @xmath0 .",
    "the random group in models associated with @xmath0 acts on a ring complex of type @xmath0 .    theorem [ t - randomization autf2 ] is proved in [ s - random autf2 ] using the classification of puzzles .",
    "it relies on a more general result in [ s - nonplanar ] ( theorem [ th - gromov z2 puzzles ] ) establishing the flat closing conjecture under a technical assumption which is satisfied for randomizations of @xmath0 .",
    "we do not pursue the study of general ring puzzles in this paper .",
    "the definition is very much in the spirit of introducing new rank interpolation tools ( compare @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the ring conditions seem to give rise to an interesting set of objects to study in their own right .",
    "we will further discuss two points related to the theorem [ t - randomization autf2 ] and its proof :    a.   there are several significant differences between randomizations of @xmath0 and randomizations of nonarchimedean lattices as considered in @xcite .",
    "for example , we show in [ s - nonplanar ] that : + for some choice of the deterministic data , the random group contains @xmath6 with overwhelming probability at arbitrary density @xmath5 . + here",
    "the deterministic data has to be chosen suitably , it is associated the symmetric groups @xmath7 .",
    "the property underlying the statement of the theorem , which is satisfied for deterministic data associated with @xmath7 , is the _ small tori property _ defined in [ s - nonplanar ] , see definition [ d - small tori property ] .",
    "b.   the above raises the question of using ring puzzles as `` blueprints '' to construct groups which resemble @xmath0 in a geometrical sense .",
    "while we can produce a wide range of random examples , finding explicit groups does not appear to be an easy task .",
    "we give an explicit construction of such a group in [ s - explicit examples 2 ] .",
    "a _ ring puzzle _ is a tessellation of the euclidean plane @xmath8 using planar polygons with coloured angles .",
    "the _ ring _ at a vertex of the puzzle is the coloured circle ( of length @xmath9 ) of small radius around that vertex .    by _ ring puzzle problem",
    "_ we mean the problem of classifying all puzzles whose coloured polygons and rings belong to prescribed sets .",
    "we consider here the following instance of the problem , which is related to @xmath0 .",
