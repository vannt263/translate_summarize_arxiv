    "in its original inception supersymmetry pertains to a system of fermions and bosons exhibiting an invariance with respect to exchange between these two classes of particles . it may therefore be somewhat surprising to discover that a fermion system on its own can also exhibit _ dynamical supersymmetry_. states with even and odd fermion numbers are then unified in a single representation of a supergroup .",
    "this is discussed in general below and demonstrated for a specific nuclear model .",
    "states of even and odd nuclei are in principle eigenstates of the same hamiltonian obtained for different particle numbers . although there is no fundamental difference between even and odd nuclei from this point of view , their properties are , however , quite different .",
    "a unification of spectra of even and odd nuclei into a single framework is therefore a challenging possibility , with the prospect of unveiling a basic underlying symmetry .",
    "the notion of supersymmetry has in fact proved to be fruitful in nuclear structure physics@xcite .",
    "properties of some neighboring even and odd nuclei can namely be classified and understood in terms of an assumed supersymmetry within the framework of the interacting boson - fermion model ( ibfm)@xcite .",
    "although this phenomenological supersymmetry does not necessarily imply dynamical supersymmetry on the microscopic level , the ibfm@xcite does achieve a unification of even and odd states on the phenomenological level . starting from a common boson - fermion hamiltonian",
    "one finds that in some instances states of an even nucleus , described by many - boson wave functions , are linked by supersymmetry to states in a neighboring odd nucleus in which the odd fermion is treated explicitly .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that pauli correlations between the odd particle and even core are not fully taken into account in the ibfm . in this sense",
    "the link between observed supersymmetry and an underlying microscopy is tenuous and no detailed microscopic understanding of the ibfm hypothesis in fact exists so far .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the link between dynamical supersymmetry and some fermion algebraic models . for this purpose",
    "we apply the recently developed dyson boson - fermion mapping @xcite which has the key property of mapping an even fermion system ( comprised of collective pairs ) to a purely boson system , and at the same time an odd fermion system ( comprised of collective pairs and an odd fermion ) to a system of collective bosons and a single ideal fermion .",
    "the construction is valid for any number of collective pairs and non - collective fermions treated individually , and preserves the pauli principle exactly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec6 ] and [ sec2 ] we discuss respectively the general properties of dynamical supersymmetry as it is manifested in nuclear physics , and the boson - fermion mapping which we use to construct it .",
    "[ sec3 ] presents a simple example of the appearance of a dynamical supersymmetry in the su(2 ) seniority model .",
    "then , in sec.[sec4 ] , we describe a more realistic system with the algebraic structure of so(8)@xmath0so(5 ) which also exhibits a dynamical supersymmetry similar to that appearing in the ibfm .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the present paper is an expanded version of a short unpublished communication @xcite .",
    "the ibfm@xcite generalizes the phenomenological interacting boson model ( ibm)@xcite to odd systems by coupling single fermion degrees of freedom to the ibm bosons , _ assuming _ these fermions to be kinematically independent from the bosons .",
    "the most general one- plus two - body ibfm hamiltonian contains pure boson and pure fermion parts , as well as an interacting part , the only requirement being that boson and fermion numbers are conserved separately .    even for the most restricted fermion subspaces",
    "this hamiltonian still contains far too many parameters to serve as the basis for a purely phenomenological analysis .",
    "microscopically inspired considerations can , on the one hand , serve as a guideline to effect a reduction to a few manageable terms@xcite , while dynamical bose - fermi symmetry and , eventually , dynamical supersymmetry can also serve to restrict the dynamics .",
    "these dynamical symmetries , their consequences and eventual comparison with experimental data are discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis where ( extended ) supersymmetry is successfully used to account for properties of negative parity states in @xmath1ir . ) here we only briefly recount the most salient aspects of , respectively , dynamical bose - fermi and supersymmetry on the phenomenological level in order to make it clear what we accomplish in our construction of a dynamical supersymmetry on the microscopic level .",
    "recall that dynamical symmetry refers to a hamiltonian which can be written in terms of casimir invariants of the algebras appearing in a _",
    "single _ chain of associated subgroups only , whence an analytical expression can be found for the energy spectrum by exploiting a basis labelled according to irreps of the highest group in the chain@xcite .",
    "this situation implies various relationships between strength parameters of the general hamiltonian and thus represents a considerable restriction . from the phenomenological point of view one",
    "studies whether dynamical symmetries indeed appear among nuclear spectra ; from the microscopic point of view one would endeavour to motivate a set of strength parameters conforming to a dynamical symmetry .",
    "an extensive literature exists for both types of study  see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a presentation of phenomenological studies and ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of microscopic investigations .",
    "the general form of the highest or first group in the subgroup chain pertaining to a bose - fermi symmetry of the ibfm type can be written as g@xmath2g@xmath3 and in the simplest version of the ibm with one @xmath4- and five @xmath5-bosons this takes the form u(6)@xmath0u(2@xmath6 ) with @xmath7 the dimension of the fermion space .",
    "dynamical symmetries for situations where the boson and fermion subchains are essentially independent are the least restrictive and not very interesting . however ,",
    "when some of the algebras appearing in the two chains are the same or isomorphic , one has the possibility to couple them to a spinor algebra .",
    "when this happens beyond the level of the rotation group , the dynamical structure seems to be sufficiently restrictive to lead to interesting and manageable classification schemes which are also realised in some nuclei@xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that a dynamical bose - fermi symmetry with a given set of strength parameters pertains to one specific odd nucleus , the number of bosons @xmath8 being fixed as @xmath9 with @xmath10 the number of valence nucleons .",
    "a more ambitious attempt to implement dynamical symmetry is to consider u(@xmath11)@xmath0 u(@xmath7 ) , with @xmath11 the number of single boson states , as being embedded in the supergroup u(@xmath12 ) .",
    "this implies that one is considering the classification of nuclear states in a set of neighbouring even and odd nuclei within a single supersymmetric representation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the number of unpaired nucleons , and where the hamiltonian parameters and all other parameters appearing in physical operators are the same for all the nuclei under consideration  clearly a severe dynamical restriction .",
    "note that the supersymmetric representation is specified not by the effective number of fermions , @xmath16 , but by the number of bosons plus fermions , @xmath17 , which of course underlies the possibility to use the single supersymmetric representation for a set of adjacent nuclei .",
    "although this type of dynamical supersymmetry is invariably found to be broken , there seems to be enough evidence @xcite that it is a useful scheme for classification and calculation of nuclear properties for a number of nuclei .",
    "what concerns us mostly in the remainder of this paper is the question whether dynamical supersymmetry , as summarized above , can be compatible with the pauli principle or , alternatively , if dynamical supersymmetry can be an exact property of a fermion system . from the point of view",
    "that there are important pauli corrections to the lowest order association between collective fermion pairs and ibm bosons@xcite , one might anticipate a negative answer to this question . nevertheless , we show that the implementation of appropriate boson - fermion mappings indeed reveals instances where this compatibility holds .",
    "these mappings , introduced and refined in refs.@xcite , and discussed and exploited below , introduce an equivalence between a system of interacting fermions on the one hand , and on the other a system of interacting bosons and fermions which are _ by construction kinematically independent_. although no guarantee in itself , this clearly fulfills the minimum requirement for a dynamical supersymmetry to exist , namely to have the appropriate degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , as elaborated below , one can indeed find instances where dynamical supersymmetry emerges as an exact classification scheme of fermion states .",
    "this is simply an alternative , but equivalent , classification to whatever classification scheme may have been adopted on the fermion level .",
    "what the boson - fermion mapping accomplishes is to make the inherent supersymmetric nature transparent in these instances , although they should also be identifiable on a purely algebraic level in terms of relationships between standard and supersymmetric representations .",
    "apart from providing a concrete link between fermion dynamics and dynamical supersymmetry , the use of boson - fermion mappings also allows one to _ construct _ various transition operators appropriate to the boson - fermion description .",
    "this is in contrast to the phenomenological situation where one is obliged to truncate an infinite series of combinations of boson and fermion operators with phenomenological parameters and terms only restricted by their tensor and particle number changing properties@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the choice of these transition operators in phenomenological models such as the ibm or ibfm is _ not _ dictated by the hamiltonian parameters in general , specifically also in the case of dynamical symmetry or supersymmetry .",
    "( see also ref.@xcite for a discussion of this point . ) in the present context we show e.g.  how the single fermion transfer operator is uniquely specified in the boson - fermion description by the appropriate mapping and how it compares with phenomenological results .",
    "finally , our work provides the possibility of a direct link between phenomenological models which introduce dynamical supersymmetry in an inherently fermion problem , such as is in the ibfm , and fermion models which exploit a similar structure by considering both vector and spinor representations of the the overall symmetry group , such as in the very recent fermion dynamical symmetry model ( fdsm ) analysis@xcite .",
    "our formalism is thus tailor made to investigate the similarities and differences between the two approaches .",
    "in order to keep the paper as self - contained as possible , we briefly retrace the basic steps in the derivation of the dyson boson - fermion mapping @xcite used in subsequent sections .",
    "we start from a fermion collective pair algebra comprised of collective fermion pair creation operators @xmath18=@xmath19 , pair annihilation operators @xmath20 , and their commutators @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the notation exploits a summation convention in which upper ( lower ) indices denote creation ( annihilation ) operators , as in @xmath22=@xmath23 and @xmath18=@xmath24 .",

    "analyze some general properties of these images .",
    "we note that the similarity transformation ( [ eq3 ] ) does not change any state in which there are no bosons @xmath48 , and therefore the single - fermion states are mapped onto single ideal fermion states , @xmath49 . since the images of pair creation operators ( [ e228c ] ) do not change the ideal fermion number , collective odd states @xmath50 are mapped onto ideal states with one ideal fermion only .",

    "can be linked to even generators ( see also expression ( [ bosfch ] ) and its discussion below ) , this identification makes it possible to write the hamiltonian ( [ pairhbf ] ) in yet another form in terms of both even generators and _ supergenerators _ of u(1/2@xmath6 ) : @xmath90 after the mapping states with a given fermion number @xmath10 are classified according to the number of bosons @xmath8 and the number of ideal fermions @xmath91 , these numbers still being related to the fermion number @xmath10 through @xmath10=@xmath92+@xmath15 .",
    "the number of ideal fermions now corresponds to the seniority quantum number , because all fermion pairs coupled to zero angular momentum are mapped onto bosons .",
    "this latter identification follows by construction , as any attempt to create an ideal fermion pair of angular momentum zero by applying ( [ su141e ] ) successively ( with appropriate coupling ) , results in the creation of the boson @xmath78 .",
    "as long as we do not overfill the @xmath58 level by too many particles , i.e. , restrict the ideal space to physical states with @xmath93 , the fermion space results are exactly reproduced in the boson - fermion space .",
    "in general it is not possible , as in this simple case , to make , for a given fixed particle number , an _ a priori _ selection of simple ideal space states which will span the physical subspace .",
    "however , as elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can exploit the simplicity of the ideal space basis for the diagonalization of the mapped hamiltonian .",
    "the physical eigenstates do not mix with the unphysical states and can by identified after the diagonalization .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent application of this procedure . )    in the original fermion space of the su(2 ) seniority model , the hamiltonian eigenstates are classified according to the representations of the subgroup chain @xmath94 while in the boson - fermion space they are classified by the quantum numbers derived from the chain @xmath95 in the second chain the supergroup u(1/2@xmath6 ) is generated by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , with the first two operators belonging to the even sector and the remaining two to the odd sector of the superalgebra , respectively .",
    "the appearance of u(1/@xmath7 ) in the chain is clearly suggested by the form ( [ pairhbfb ] ) and also dictates that the same hamiltonian parameters in ( [ pairhbf ] ) are used for both even and odd states , if the hamiltonian should be viewed as a phenomenological boson - fermion hamiltonian . from the mapping point of view",
    "there is of course no real choice in this matter , as the original fermion hamiltonian pertains to any number of particles .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note already here how the phenomenological extension to superalgebras _  la _ ibfm may be suggested from a microscopic point of view .    in the dynamical supersymmetry concept , those states of the system with the same number of _ ideal _ particles @xmath85 belong to a single supersymmetric representation @xmath13 of the supergroup , here u(1/@xmath7 ) .",

    "this is so because in the chain ( [ bosfch ] ) the supergroup u(1/@xmath7 ) is immediately split into the boson and fermion sectors which remain separate down to the bottom of the chain . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , potentially interesting situations which are restrictive from the supersymmetry point of view , occur if at a certain level of subgroups one may find the same subgroups in the boson and fermion sectors , and combine them together into a given boson - fermion subgroup .",
    "such a situation arises in a fermion model with a richer structure than the present su(2 ) case and is discussed in the next section . in terms of algebras appearing in the chain ( [ bosfch ] ) , we here only find a trivial example of the boson subalgebra u@xmath102(1 ) , generated by the boson number operator @xmath8 , and the fermion subalgebra u@xmath3(1 ) , generated by the fermion number operator @xmath15 , which can be combined into the boson - fermion subalgebra u@xmath103(1 ) , generated by @xmath85=@xmath8+@xmath15 .    at the same time , even the simplest example of the su(2 ) seniority model discussed here provides interesting consequences for the structure of the single - fermion transfer operators and the spectroscopic factors . after the mapping ,",
    "the single - fermion operators acquire terms which are responsible for the pauli correlations between the even core and the odd particle . in the phenomenological supersymmetric models these terms",
    "are postulated together with some arbitrary numerical constants , whereas in the supersymmetric picture derived from the boson - fermion mapping they are fixed by the mapping procedure itself .",
    "for example , the image of the fermion annihilation operator ( [ su141d ] ) is a combination of the ideal fermion annihilation operator with two corrective terms .",
    "the first one corresponds to an annihilation of the same ideal fermion accompanied by an attempt to replace a boson by a collective ideal fermion pair .",
    "this term ensures that after the annihilation the remaining fermions still obey the correct statistics .",
    "the second term corresponds to the standard annihilation of the boson replaced by an appropriate fermion which has been the partner of the annihilated fermion in a collective pair .",
    "of course , the relative weights of these corrective terms depend on how many ideal fermions have already been present before the annihilation .    to evaluate and understand different aspects of the original fermion and the mapped boson - fermion description , it is instructive to calculate the spectroscopic factors for the simplest states in the su(2 ) model . in the original fermion space",
    "this can be done by using the commutation relations ( [ coms ] ) and ( [ comas ] ) , and we arrive at the result @xmath104 to get this relation one has to calculate the normalization factors of the fermion states .    evaluating matrix elements",
    "( [ spect ] ) in the mapped boson - fermion space is much simpler .",
    "in particular , one can work with the ideal boson - fermion eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ pairhbf ] ) corresponding to the states with @xmath15=0 and 1 , e.g. , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",

    "furthermore , following the same reasoning as in sec.[sec3 ] , since the fermion interaction strengths pertain to even and odd systems alike , boson - fermion eigenstates of the mapped hamiltonian are contained in a single supersymmetric representation of u(6/20 ) .    as a simple application of the supersymmetric @xmath185 energy formula ( [ eqsy5 ] ) , we compare the corresponding even and odd spectra in fig .",

    "the @xmath199 state belongs to the @xmath192 representation and the above transition would be allowed .",
    "however , it is at the moment too speculative to claim that the dynamical supersymmetry discussed here may be realized in the pt - au region and allow such selection rules to be tested .",

    "@xcite and appears to have experimental evidence in the xe - ba region .",
    "see e.g.  fig .  3 of ref.@xcite with more experimental low - lying low spin states in the odd systems than seems typical for phenomenological supersymmetric spectra derived from ( [ eqsy7 ] ) .",
    "we have discussed the cases of one or zero unpaired fermions only .",
    "however , it may be shown that a one - to - one correspondence between the fermion states and the boson - fermion states holds when more unpaired particles are considered as well , provided that the ideal fermions do not form collective so(8 ) pairs and , moreover , provided that the condition @xmath201 is satisfied .",
    "in summary , we have applied the recently constructed generalized dyson boson - fermion mapping of collective algebras to the seniority su(2 ) and so(8)@xmath0so(5 ) models .",
    "the mapping gives finite non - hermitian boson - fermion images of collective pairs and single fermion operators expressed in terms of ideal boson and fermion annihilation and creation operators . in these models , and for the specific interactions chosen , we have revealed a dynamical supersymmetric structure analogous to what is found in the interacting boson - fermion model , but with full recognition of the pauli principle .",
    "the findings discussed in this paper are based on the construction of a hamiltonian from the generators of the fermion spectrum generating algebra which defines a class of dynamical symmetries@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian itself is not invariant with respect to the symmetry group , but its eigenstates can be classified by the group and subgroup representations . at this level",
    "the supersymmetric structure is not readily visible , and even and odd states simply belong to different representations of the fermion group .",
    "however , we showed that an equivalent description which does reveal a dynamical supersymmetry can be obtained after a boson - fermion mapping .    whereas the hamiltonian in the su(2 ) model was constructed from the pair operators which are mapped in a non - hermitian way ( but nevertheless yields a hermitian image for the pairing hamiltonian ) , in the so(8 ) model application the hamiltonian consisted of multipole operators with manifestly hermitian boson - fermion images .",
    "apparently , a dynamical supersymmetric construction like the one applied to the so(8 ) model could also be extended to any fermion algebraic model based on a pseudo - spin and pseudo - orbital recoupling , as e.g.  the sd sp(6 ) @xcite and sdg so(12 ) @xcite models . in such cases",
    "the unification of the collective and non - collective algebras can always be achieved on the spin(3 ) level . in the so(8 )",
    "example the corresponding group was denoted by @xmath202 .",
    "the interesting question , however , is if one can find a unification of some of the groups relevant to a given model at some higher level , as in the case of @xmath153 for the so(8 ) example .",
    "this would be analogous to a dynamical supersymmetry , or a boson - fermion dynamical symmetry in the usual ibfm sense , where the unification is usually considered to be formed at the highest level possible in the group chain .    obviously , a fermion algebraic model puts stronger restrictions on the possible extensions to odd systems . in any case",
    ", should an algebraic model be applied to describe even - even nuclei , like e.g.  the fermion dynamical symmetry model ( fdsm ) @xcite , its extension to the description of odd nuclei should also be investigated . as we have shown in this paper",
    ", the identification of dynamical symmetries ( the usual starting point of such analyses ) can sometimes be incorporated into a framework of dynamical supersymmetries after the boson - fermion mapping , thus unveiling a possibly richer dynamical symmetry structure than is immediately visible on the original fermion level .",
    "it is of interest to enquire which other  hidden \" non - trivial dynamical supersymmetries exist in algebraic fermion models and to understand the relationship between representations on the fermion level and those on the boson - fermion level from a purely algebraic point of view , without necessarily relying on the boson - fermion type mapping considered here .",
    "let us finally remark that the dynamical supersymmetry discussed in the present context presupposes that all ideal space states enter the analysis , as in the case of the so(8 ) and so(8)@xmath0so(5 ) models .",
    "if some of these states do turn out to be spurious in other cases , as they most likely will , one will have a situation which is the equivalent of what is termed the  dynamical pauli effect \" in the fdsm @xcite .",
