    "the ising model is one of the most studied models of interacting particles in statistical physics .",
    "this model has been strongly linked to the study of discrete mathematics  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "tools and techniques developed in the discrete setting have shown to be very useful to deal with the solution of problems related to the ising model and vice versa .    typically , to study the ising model , particles are located at the vertices of a graph and the type of interaction between them is determined by the existence and weight of edges in the graph . in this notes , we explore the ising model where particles and their interaction describe triangulations of closed riemann surfaces with edge - weight equal to @xmath2 .    a _ triangulation _ of a closed riemann surface @xmath1 , or simply a triangulation , is an embedding of a graph in @xmath1 so that each face boundary is a @xmath0-cycle of the graph . throughout this work",
    ", the closed riemann surface @xmath1 will be specified just in needed cases .",
    "let s introduce the main ingredients of the ising model . given a triangulation @xmath3 ,",
    "a _ state _ of the ising model on @xmath3 is a function @xmath4 that assigns to each vertex of @xmath3 a value from the set @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the set of vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "values @xmath8 and @xmath2 are usually called _",
    "spins_. then , we also say that a state on @xmath3 is a _ spin - assignment _ on @xmath3 . for each state @xmath4 , the _ energy _ or _ hamiltonian _ of the ising model on a triangulation @xmath3 is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the set of edges of @xmath3 and for each @xmath11 in @xmath10 the parameter @xmath12 is called _",
    "coupling constant_. the main purpose of a coupling constant @xmath12 is to specify the type of interaction between vertices @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in general",
    ", this constant may vary from positive to negative depending on the characteristics of the system to be studied .",
    "it can also be randomly chosen , like in the case of spin - glasses .",
    "the _ antiferromagnetic _ variant of the ising model takes coupling constant equal to  @xmath2 for all edges of the graph .",
    "then , given a triangulation @xmath3 and a state @xmath4 , the energy of @xmath4 in the antiferromagnetic ising model is given by @xmath15    many mathematical problems naturally arise from the ising model .",
    "one of them is the study of states that provide the minimum possible energy for the system .",
    "those states are usually known as _",
    "groundstates_. related to the study of groundstates , is the _ groundstate degeneracy _ , which by definition corresponds to the number of different groundstates that a system supports .",
    "if the groundstate degeneracy of a system is greater than two ( i.e. more than one pair of groundstates exist ) , it is said that the groundstate is _",
    "degenerated_. otherwise , it is called _ non - degenerated_. the groundstate degeneracy has been vastly studied  @xcite , being of great physical interest , because ( among others ) it determines the entropy of the system , and characterizing entropy s behaviour helps to understand physical phenomena associated to order and stability of the system  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be a triangulation and @xmath16 be a state of the antiferromagnetic ising model on @xmath3 .",
    "it is said that @xmath17 is frustrated by @xmath4 or that @xmath4 frustrates @xmath17 if @xmath18 .",
    "observe that each state on @xmath3 frustrates at least one edge of each face boundary of the triangulation since each face boundary is @xmath0-cycle .",
    "this feature ( every state frustrates at least one edge of each face boundary ) is known as geometrical frustration .",
    "the understanding of order and stability of geometrically frustrated systems , is one of the main questions that condensed matter physicists face to explain .",
    "it is expected that systems which exhibit geometrical frustration lead to highly degenerated groundstates with a non - zero entropy at zero temperature  ( see  @xcite ) . in other words , groundstate degeneracy in a geometrically frustrated system",
    "is typically exponentially large as a function of the number of vertices of the underlying graph . indeed ,",
    "groundstate degeneracy of any plane triangulation is exponential in the number of vertices , since groundstate degeneracy of plane triangulations is twice the number of perfect matchings of cubic bridgeless planar graphs  ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , in this work it is shown that there are triangulations of closed riemann surfaces with an arbitrary number of vertices and a non - degenerated antiferromagnetic groundstate .",
    "more precisely , we establish the next result .",
    "[ theo : onesat ] let @xmath1 be a fixed closed riemann surface with positive genus ( @xmath19 ) . then , for every @xmath20 there is a triangulation @xmath3 of @xmath1 with @xmath21 so that @xmath3 has a non - degenerated antiferromagnetic groundstate .",
    "in particular , when the closed riemann surface @xmath1 is a torus , we have the following .",
    "[ theo : onesat - toro ] for every @xmath20 there is a toroidal triangulation @xmath3 with @xmath21 so that @xmath3 has a non - degenerated antiferromagnetic groundstate .",
    "throughout this work , it will be needed to consider triangulations of closed riemann surfaces with some removed faces ( with holes ) so that each hole is circumscribed by a @xmath0-cycle .",
    "triangulations of this type will be called punctured triangulations  ( see for example  figure  [ fig : twoholess ] ; triangles in grey depict holes ) . in general , every term defined for triangulations is naturally adapted to punctured triangulations .",
    "however , there are some facts that hold only for triangulations ; they will be properly specified .",
    "we now introduce definitions for both triangulations and punctured triangulations .",
    "let @xmath3 be a ( punctured ) triangulation . recall that every spin - assignment on @xmath3 frustrates at least one edge of each face boundary of  @xmath3 .",
    "notice that a spin - assignment is a groundstate if it has the smallest possible number of frustrated edges ( see equation  [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "a spin - assignment @xmath4 on @xmath3 is said to be _ satisfying _ if @xmath4 frustrates exactly one edge of each face boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a triangulation .",
    "obviously any satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath3 is a groundstate .",
    "the converse is true for plane triangulations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the equivalence does not hold in general because a satisfying spin - assignment does nt need to exist .",
    "however , note that when satisfying spin - assignments exist , then every groundstate corresponds to a satisfying spin - assignment .",
    "the situation is more complicated if @xmath3 is a punctured triangulation , since distinct satisfying spin - assignments on @xmath3 may provide distinct antiferromagnetic energy . in figure  [ punctured ] an example is shown .",
    "observe that given a ( punctured ) triangulation @xmath3 , a spin - assignment @xmath4 on @xmath3 is satisfying if and only if @xmath22 is also a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath3 .",
    "we shall refer to this fact as _",
    "sign symmetry_. we will use it in order to reduce the number of cases that need to be analysed in the proofs . moreover , if @xmath3 admits exactly two satisfying spin - assignments @xmath4 and @xmath22 , we say that @xmath3 admits a unique pair of satisfying spin - assignments .",
    "if @xmath4 assigns the same spin on all vertices of a subgraph @xmath23 of @xmath3 ( respectively all elements of @xmath24 ) , we say that @xmath23 ( respectively a subset @xmath25 ) is _ monochromatic _ under @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , we say that an edge is monochromatic ( respectively non - monochromatic ) under @xmath4 if  @xmath4 assigns the same ( respectively distinct ) spins on both ends of the edge .",
    "in other words , an edge is monochromatic under @xmath4 if and only if it is frustrated by @xmath4 .",
    "monochromatic and non - monochromatic faces are defined analogously depending on whether or not its face boundary is either monochromatic or non - monochromatic .",
    "then , a spin - assignment @xmath4 to @xmath3 is satisfying if and only if every face of @xmath3 is non - monochromatic under @xmath4 .",
    "an edge @xmath26 in @xmath10 will be called _ serious _ if and only if @xmath26 is monochromatic under every satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath3 .    in",
    "what follows , serious edges are depicted as thicker lines and holes of punctured triangulations are depicted as grey areas .      this section is devoted to prove theorem  [ theo : onesat - toro ] and to discuss some features of toroidal triangulations with a non - degenerated groundstate . here",
    ", we show a strategy to construct toroidal triangulations with a non - degenerated groundstate , where a groundstate is a satisfying spin - assignment . nevertheless , we strongly believe there are many other ways to construct them and also that the class of toroidal triangulations with a non - degenerated groundstate is not small . the proof of theorem  [ theo : onesat - toro ] is constructive and",
    "it is based on a simple idea . however , it is far from being trivial to find the concrete triangulations to make that idea work .",
    "next , we give definitions and an overview of the proof .",
    "let @xmath3 be a toroidal triangulation that admits exactly one pair of satisfying spin - assignments ( recall that when a satisfying spin - assignment exists , satisfying spin - assignments are identical to groundstates ) and @xmath4 denote a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath3 .",

    "we say that the pair @xmath28 is _ invariant under removal _ of @xmath27 if the punctured triangulation @xmath29 obtained by removing all faces contained in the set @xmath27 , has exactly one pair of satisfying spin - assignments .",
    "in particular , @xmath30 is a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath29 if and only @xmath31 .",
    "if such a set of faces @xmath27 exists , we say that @xmath3 is a _ supporting triangulation _",

    "clearly , @xmath29 is an embedding of a graph in a torus with @xmath32 triangular holes .",
    "observe that the existence of a removable set of faces is not trivial : one could remove from @xmath3 a non - empty set of faces in such a way that the obtained triangulation has more satisfying spin - assignments than  @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a supporting triangulation , @xmath27 be a removable set of faces of @xmath3 , @xmath4 be a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath3 and @xmath29 be the supporting punctured triangulation associated to @xmath3 and @xmath27 .",
    "the face boundaries of the faces in @xmath27 ( in other words , the @xmath0-cycles circumscribing the holes of @xmath29 ) , will be referred to as the _ expandable cycles _ of @xmath29 .",
    "the set of edges contained in the expandable cycles which are monochromatic under @xmath4 will be called the _ fundamental edges _ of @xmath29 .",
    "notice that each expandable cycle contains exactly one fundamental edge , since each expandable cycle is non - monochromatic under @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , fundamental edges of @xmath29 are serious .",
    "assume that a supporting triangulation @xmath3 exists .",
    "then , we know that a supporting punctured triangulation @xmath29 associated to @xmath3 admits exactly one pair of satisfying spin - assignments , say @xmath4 , @xmath22 and all expandable cycles of @xmath29 are non - monochromatic under @xmath4 with its fundamental edges monochromatic under @xmath4",
    ". in our construction , each hole of @xmath29 ( circumscribed by an expandable cycle ) will be covered by a plane triangulation in such a way that the number of vertices of the toroidal triangulation increases and the number of satisfying spin - assignments keeps constant . to achieve this task , it is needed a plane triangulation @xmath33 with an arbitrary number of vertices and satisfying the following condition : if @xmath34 is the face boundary of the outer face of @xmath33 , then there is a unique pair of satisfying spin - assignments on @xmath33 such that at least one edge from the set of edges @xmath35 is monochromatic ; say @xmath36 .",
    "we refer to @xmath33 as an _ augmenting triangulation _ and we say that edge @xmath36 is a fundamental edge of @xmath33 .",
    "an augmenting triangulation always exists , since plane triangulations are duals of cubic bridgeless planar graphs and every perfect matching of a cubic bridgeless planar graph @xmath37 corresponds to the set of monochromatic edges under a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath38 .",
    "then , an augmenting triangulation is the dual of a cubic bridgeless planar graph with a specified edge contained in exactly one perfect matching .",
    "next , we show that supporting triangulations exist . in subsection  [ augmenting ] we will describe a family of augmenting triangulations .",
    "finally , in subsection  [ subsec : prooftheotoro ] we formalize the proof of theorem  [ theo : onesat - toro ] .",
    "the minimal triangulations of a surface are those that have every edge in a _",
    "a _ splitting _ of a vertex @xmath14 replaces the vertex @xmath14 by two vertices @xmath39 and @xmath40 connected by a new edge @xmath41 , and replaces each edge @xmath42 incident to @xmath14 either by the edge @xmath43 or by @xmath44 .",
    "it is well - known that every triangulation of a given surface @xmath1 , may be generated by a sequence of vertex - splittings from a minimal triangulation of @xmath1 . in general ,",
    "the set of minimal triangulations is finite for every fixed surface  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are 21 minimal toroidal triangulations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural and potentially useful to look for supporting triangulations in the set of minimal toroidal triangulations . on one hand",
    "its reduced number of vertices allow to verify the required properties manually , on the other hand , it strongly indicates a possible way to describe the whole set of toroidal triangulations with a non - degenerated groundstate since every toroidal triangulation may be generated from a minimal one .",
    "we exhibit the subset of minimal triangulations of the torus which have the property of being a supporting triangulation ( see figure  [ fig : supptriang ] ) .",
    "however , some minimal triangulations of the torus which are not supporting can become supporting after some slight modifications , namely , after edge - flippings and vertex - splittings .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis is not the aim of this work and will be studied separately .    in the first row of figure",
    "[ fig : supptriang ] , all minimal toroidal triangulations which are supporting triangulations are depicted ( in each picture opposite sides have to be identified ) . in the second row of figure",
    "[ fig : supptriang ] are depicted the supporting punctured triangulations obtained from the removal of a set of removable faces of each supporting triangulation above .",
    "we will formally prove supportability only for one of the triangulation depicted in figure  [ fig : supptriang ] .",
    "the same proof ideas can be easily applied for the remaining cases .",
    "[ prop : supptriang ] let @xmath3 be the toroidal triangulation depicted in figure  [ fig : noholess ] and @xmath27 be the subset of faces of @xmath3 with face boundary the cycles @xmath45 and @xmath46 . then , triangulation @xmath3 is a supporting triangulation and @xmath27 is a removable set of faces of @xmath3 .",

    "to do that , by sign symmetry it suffices to verify that exactly one of the following three initial configurations can be extended to a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath29 ( vertex labels as in figure  [ fig : twoholess ] ) : [ 1 ] when the cycle @xmath47 is assigned spin @xmath48 , [ 2 ] when the cycle @xmath47 is assigned spin @xmath49 , [ 3 ] when the cycle @xmath47 is assigned spin @xmath50 .",
    "then , it is necessary to check that both expandable cycles are non - monochromatic under such satisfying spin - assignment .    in figures  [ fig : nomono_no1 ] and [ fig : nomono_no2 ]",
    "the case when @xmath11 is non - monochromatic is worked out ; a subindex @xmath51 accompanying a @xmath52 or @xmath53 sign indicates that the spin is forced by the spin - assignments with smaller indices in order for the assignment to be satisfiable  if spins assigned on the vertices of a face boundary are forced to be all of the same sign , then no satisfying assignment can exist under the given initial conditions .",
    "this establishes that when the cycle @xmath47 is assigned @xmath49 or @xmath50 , there is no satisfying spin - assignment extension on @xmath29 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : monos_supp ] , the case when edge @xmath11 is monochromatic is studied . in this situation ,",
    "two subcases arise , depending on whether or not the spin @xmath8 is assigned to vertex @xmath54 ( vertex labels as in figure  [ fig : twoholess ] )  each subcase is dealt in the same way as the previous situation and worked out separately in figures  [ fig : mono_no ] and  [ fig : mono_si ] .",
    "this shows that there exist a unique satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath29 .    finally , notice that both expandable cycles of @xmath29 are non - monochromatic under the unique satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath29 ( depicted in figure  [ fig : mono_si ] ) .",

    "it implies that in any extension to a satisfying spin - assignment on @xmath66 , the @xmath0-cycle @xmath74 has spin @xmath50 .",
    "then , by induction hypothesis uniqueness holds .",

    "it follows from the construction that the toroidal triangulation @xmath78 has a unique pair of groundstates .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ theo : onesat ] is relatively straightforward from the construction made for proving theorem  [ theo : onesat - toro ] . unlike the case of triangulations of the torus , in theorem  [ theo : onesat ] the genus of the closed riemann surface may be arbitrarily large",
    "however , the described supporting punctured triangulations can perform the task of increasing genus and at the same time keeping all properties of existence and uniqueness of satisfying spin - assignments in such a way that the same construction made in subsection  [ subsec : prooftheotoro ] works . next , we add some new definitions and show how to deal with the construction for proving theorem  [ theo : onesat ] .",
