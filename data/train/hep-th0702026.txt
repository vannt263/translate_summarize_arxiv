    "the issue of hierarchical supersymmetry breakdown and moduli stabilisation returns as one of the leading themes in superstring phenomenology .",
    "one needs to create a potential for various moduli fields which should simultaneously break supersymmetry , split masses of superpartners in observable sector , and fix the remaining parameters of the low energy lagrangian . selecting the right vacuum",
    "is made more difficult by the existence of a trivial vacuum in stringy models , corresponding to a noninteracting theory . to make the low - energy vacuum stable",
    "one needs to make the barrier between the finite and trivial vacua sufficiently high and steep , which in particular implies that the masses of the moduli , like the dilaton and the volume modulus , should be notably larger than the tev scale ( which is also the scale of the gravitino mass in scenarios with gravity mediation ) .",
    "in addition , the scale of the vacuum energy has to be realistically small , orders of magnitude below the tev scale .",
    "the last requirement is particularly difficult to fulfil , as in generic models of spontaneous supergravity breaking the vacuum energy tends to become negative , of the order @xmath2 .",
    "there are a limited number of options to uplift the vacuum energy to make it vanish or slightly positive .",
    "firstly , one may add an uplifting term which explicitly breaks local supersymmetry .",
    "this route has been known as the kklt scenario , @xcite , and has been widely explored by many authors .",
    "secondly , the uplifting could be supersymmetric , if one finds a way to cancel the negative definite term @xmath3 in the sugra scalar potential by a ) @xmath4  d - term uplifting or b ) @xmath5  f - term uplifting .",
    "the first option has been explored in @xcite , and , in @xcite , it was found that with a single non - perturbative sector , the cancellation of the cosmological constant by the d - term while keeping hierarchically small gravitino mass is possible provided certain fine - tuning can be accepted and suitable corrections to the khler potential of the volume modulus are introduced .",
    "otherwise , as noted earlier in @xcite one tends to obtain a heavy modulus and either a very heavy gravitino mass or an excessively large cosmological constant .",
    "an example of f - term cancellation is no - scale supergravity , which however does nt stabilise the no - scale modulus at tree level .",
    "a way out of this problem has been proposed in @xcite and further explored in @xcite , where a d - term was suggested as an additional contribution fixing the value of the no - scale modulus . a general study of f - term uplifting given by @xcite demonstrated that if supersymmetry is broken by f - terms from a sector that is not strongly influenced by gravity , the susy breaking sector can act as an uplifting potential .",
    "in fact , it has been subsequently shown that uplifting and simultaneous stabilisation due solely to the f - terms is possible in simple cases of the oraifeartaigh type @xcite , with iss - type @xcite or polonyi hidden sectors , considered in @xcite and in warped backgrounds @xcite .",
    "however , tuning is necessary in these models too , and in the supersymmetry breaking sector one needs to give up on the ( stringy ) feature that all dynamically generated mass scales , which eventually provide explanation of hierarchy between the planck and the electroweak scales , are moduli dependent .    in this letter we present a refined mechanism of supersymmetric f - term uplifting in the presence of consistent d - terms .",
    "we introduce two condensing sectors ( thus effectively we are employing the racetrack scheme ) .",
    "this has the advantage that the role of the constant term in the superpotential , @xmath0 , which is crucial in the schemes with a single condensate , changes , as the two condensates compete with each other and not with the @xmath0 .",
    "in addition we introduce a spectator charged scalar . as a result , we can rather easily , without any dramatic tree - level hierarchy among the dimensionful parameters of the lagrangian , achieve nearly vanishing positive or negative ( or zero ) cosmological constant with all moduli stabilised and small gravitino mass .",
    "the d - terms vanish at the interesting minima , and the cancellation of the negative @xmath3 is realised by the f - terms of the moduli fields with the d - term acting indirectly , but non - trivially , as a constraint on the f - term and superpotential contributions to the potential .",
    "the d - term also serves as a source of large contribution to the mass matrix , hence one of the fields becomes very heavy while the others stay light .",
    "the existence of a state heavier than the condensation scale is consistent with the fact that stabilisation and cancellation of the vacuum energy result from the interplay between the gauge sector and gravity - suppressed contributions .",
    "a distinct feature of the model discussed here is that except @xmath0 which serves mainly as a source of mass for the lightest scalar , all scales in the hidden sector are dynamically generated with all gauge couplings explicitly field - dependent , as implied by string theory , in contrast to models with iss - type hidden sectors , @xcite , considered in @xcite , where the crucial mass scale in the hidden sector has been put in arbitrarily .",
    "to start with let us assume for simplicity that the dilaton becomes stabilized and decouples at some scale @xmath6 close to the planck scale , and below @xmath6 the superpotential for the light volume modulus takes the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . with the simple expression @xmath9 , one stabilizes the @xmath10-modulus but with a negative cosmological constant , @xmath11 .",
    "this can be remedied by adding in a positive `` d - term '' contribution @xmath12 which depends on @xmath10 in such a way that a ) it makes the @xmath13 positive or zero , and b ) it does nt spoil the stabilization of @xmath10 . in the scenario presented by kklt it has been assumed that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "this can be seen as arising from brane - antibrane forces , but then supersymmetry is explicitly broken in the effective 4d lagrangian .",
    "this makes it difficult to reliably study questions about soft supersymmetry breaking within 4d field theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an interesting possibility is that the uplifting term could be a fi term coming from gauging of a shift symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , as noticed by dudas et al .",
    "@xcite the simple superpotential @xmath16 is not invariant under the local imaginary shift of @xmath10 : @xmath17 which produces d - terms of the required form .",
    "it turns out that introducing a gauge invariant version of the superpotential changes the rules of the game .",
    "we shall follow this route below , putting aside the possibility of gauging an r - symmetry is excluded , and many other useful terms are problematic , like a purely dilatonic piece .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown in that one can construct simple models of this type which have flat or ds minima for @xmath10 with broken supersymmetry .",
    "] , see zwirner et al.@xcite , binetruy et al.@xcite .",
    "in this letter we will limit our focus to models which are invariant under non - r @xmath18 gauge symmetry .",
    "let us consider gauging of the imaginary shift of the modulus @xmath10 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that one can indeed realise such a situation in stringy models .",
    "let @xmath19 .",
    "the shift @xmath17 is generated by the killing vector @xmath20 where @xmath21 is real .",
    "the prepotential @xmath22 fulfills the killing equation @xmath23 , and generates the scalar potential @xmath24 .",
    "one finds , upon solving the killing equation , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a genuine constant .",
    "if @xmath27 the gauged symmetry acts on gravitini and becomes a local @xmath18 r - symmetry , as described earlier .",
    "we shall set @xmath28 in what follows . to be consistent with global supersymmetry algebra the superpotential must be invariant under any local ( non - r ) symmetry .",
    "the invariant superpotential which is solely a function of the modulus @xmath10 must therefore be a constant .",
    "this is not sufficient to stabilize the @xmath10 .",
    "the solution is to introduce more charged fields : @xmath29      let us assume that the source of the superpotential for @xmath10 is non - perturbative effects in a strongly coupled gauge theory",
    ". for simplicity let us take @xmath30 hidden gauge group with @xmath31 pairs of @xmath32 and @xmath33 representations .",
    "in addition , let us assume that the fields are charged under a local @xmath18 .",
    "below the condensation scale the effective non - perturbative superpotential is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the condensation scale is related to the modulus @xmath10 through the relation @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "let us take @xmath39 .",
    "then the superpotential becomes @xmath40 this is invariant under the local @xmath18 if @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "in general this means that @xmath43 is nonzero , so naively it is anomalous .",
    "however , the 4d green - schwarz mechanism may be employed to cancel the one - loop anomalous diagrams , or one can imagine adding to the model a number of charged fields which do not enter the superpotential .    to be able to write down the effective potential one needs also the khler function for the composite meson fields",
    "m. here one should use symmetries .",
    "possible choices are for instance @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "since we do not believe that a particular choice of the khler potential could play a significant role , we take the first option which leads to cleaner formulae .",
    "the simplest model that works analogously to the original kklt model is the one with a racetrack superpotential stabilizing @xmath10 : @xmath46 with @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "we assume the khler function @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "notice that there could be a constant contribution to the khler potential , @xmath51 , which would rescale uniformly all terms in the scalar potential by @xmath52 , except the contribution @xmath53 . in this respect @xmath51 acts in the way analogous to that of the charge @xmath54 , which in turn rescales _",
    "only _ @xmath53 . the superpotential is defined up to the overall complex phase .",
    "hence , one can fix that phase in such a way that the constant part of the superpotential ( @xmath0 ) can be considered to be a real number .",

    "at first glance we have 6 degrees of freedom in this model : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in fact only 5 of them are relevant : certain combination of @xmath62 and two phases @xmath63 and @xmath64 forms the longitudinal polarisation of the massive gauge boson , that appears due to spontaneous breakdown of the shift symmetry .",
    "hence , one can gauge away one combination of these fields .",
    "alternatively , one may choose to work with a flat direction in the scalar potential .",
    "hence in practice one needs to solve the potential with respect to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath62 then the flat direction can be identified with the longitudinal polarisation .",
    "in addition , different choices of @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the different settings of the origins of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 variables respectively . without lose of generality ,",
    "one can put @xmath67 .",
    "the behaviour of this model is close to that of the racetrack , with the @xmath59 modulus being stabilised by its f - term potential .",
    "the minimum appears close to for t. ] : @xmath68 where the dynamical phases absorb any overall phases , such as the sign of @xmath69 .",
    "we expect @xmath60 and @xmath61 to be typically order one because they have no sources of hierarchy .",
    "hence the minimum reached will not be exactly the value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx_t_vev ] ) since there are additional contributions to the potential coming from the f - terms for the condensate fields and the d - term",
    ". however , for the values of the parameters considered in this paper the differences are minimal .",
    "in addition to @xmath59 , the @xmath60 and @xmath61 fields need stabilising . to see that this must happen we need only consider @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath70 only contains negative , fractional powers of @xmath60 and @xmath61 it is unbounded from below with @xmath60 and @xmath61 tending to zero .",
    "however , @xmath71 includes larger negative powers with positive coefficients , coming from the @xmath72 terms , and the negative singularity is lifted to be a positive singularity .",
    "finally , @xmath60 and @xmath61 can not run off to infinity since the f - terms for @xmath73 and @xmath74 contain positive powers of @xmath60 and @xmath61 cancelling the negative powers coming from the superpotential .",
    "since the phases are cyclic , by definition , stability is guaranteed and the number of flat directions is determined by the global symmetries . with all input parameters set to non - zero values there",
    "exists one flat direction corresponding to the anomalous @xmath18 gauge symmetry .    at this stage ,",
    "the potential is stable without needing to utilise the d - term .",
    "it is clear that the d - term contribution alone can not stabilise @xmath59 since it runs off to @xmath75 , but it does perturb the minimum reached .",
    "the importance of the d - term is in cancelling the cosmological constant . since @xmath53 is very flat at large @xmath59 its effect on the position of the minimum is minor is small",
    "; if @xmath54 is too large @xmath76 can not cancel @xmath77 and there is no solution to @xmath78 . ] , but it provides a positive definite contribution to @xmath79 , which allows the cosmological constant to be tuned to zero with arbitrary precision . as expected this closely mirrors the behaviour in the original kklt formulation , with the d - term lifting playing the role of the explicit susy breaking anti ",
    "d - brane contribution .",
    "in addition to the direct contribution of @xmath53 s energy density to @xmath79 , the d - term indirectly increases the overall energy density through its effect on @xmath71 and @xmath70 . since @xmath80 minimise with @xmath81 it follows that any alteration of the position of the minimum will increase the value of @xmath80 ( assuming no flat directions ) .",
    "it is the combination of these two effects that gives rise to the final expectation values minimising the potential .",
    "unfortunately these effects are too efficient .",
    "a very small @xmath82 is sufficient to lift from a negative to a positive minimum and a natural , order one , @xmath54 does not allow finite minimisation . in principle , from the point of view of the effective field theory a very small effective @xmath18 charge of @xmath10 and @xmath83 could be tolerable although it is highly unnatural , and it is also unnatural from the point of view of string theory .",
    "thus we shall try to improve the model in such a way that solutions with @xmath84 could be found . to this end",
    "we consider a cancellable d - term in the next section .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to have a closer look at the breaking of the anomalous @xmath18 .",
    "the mass terms come from the kinetic part of the lagrangian @xmath85 where @xmath86 and summation over charged fields is understood .",
    "one easily finds out that the mass of the vector boson is given by @xmath87 it turns out that in the models we consider here the ` anomalous ' gauge boson is always rather heavy , see table  1 .",
    "since the d - term in the previous model only minimises for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 and contains no sources of hierarchy order one values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 imply that @xmath53 will be order one . with @xmath91 , to obtain a physically reasonable gravitino mass it is clear that @xmath53 does not obtain a natural vev , as demonstrated by the smallness of @xmath54 .",
    "one approach to this problem is to introduce a field that appears with a relative minus sign inside the d - term , such that @xmath53 can go to zero for natural input parameter values .",
    "the effect of a cancellable d - term is purely the introduction of a constraint on the rest of the potential . in the limit that the solutions to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 runs over all modulus fields , are governed by the first derivatives of @xmath53 then the solution , namely the solution in which the d - term goes to zero ] to @xmath94 can be imposed as a constraint on @xmath71 and @xmath70 and , to good approximation , @xmath95 .",
    "the simplest possible d - term of this form is obtained by introducing one additional matter field , @xmath96 , with the opposite sign charge to the condensing fields .",
    "it sufficient to consider an additional field which does not appear in the superpotential , only in @xmath53 and @xmath71 .",
    "we choose to consider a canonical khler potential for simplicity .",
    "as @xmath96 does not appear in the superpotential it only interacts via the d - term and through the khler derivatives , in the f - terms .",
    "this leads to a change of @xmath97 and a change of @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the d - term potential is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the charge of @xmath96 , defined such that @xmath103 under the anomalous @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath104 had no potential , besides the d - term , it would simply move such that it was given by @xmath105 and the minimum for @xmath80 would be undisturbed .",
    "however @xmath104 has a mass term from its coupling to @xmath106 and as such is driven towards zero .",
    "exactly how much @xmath104 changes from the default value is fixed by the interplay between the minimisation of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 and the minimisation of @xmath107 .",
    "the deviation is determined by the size of the mass term for the constraint equation , which is in turn given by @xmath108 .",
    "the smaller @xmath109 is the larger the effective mass term for the constraint equation and hence the further the solution to the equation will be driven from the preferred value of @xmath80 . since moving away from this value",
    "will increase the vev of @xmath80 a small enough charge lifts the cosmological constant to be positive and all other parameter values given by table  [ tab : inputdata ] , @xmath110 is sufficient . ] .",
    "in addition to this indirect lifting , the extra matter provides a positive contribution to energy density through the mass term @xmath107 .",
    "however , since @xmath107 is driven to zero this effect is less important than the effect on @xmath80 and , alone , is insufficient to cancel @xmath70",
    ". the combined effects can lift the potential to be small and positive , as shown in our numerical examples .",
    "the cosmological constant can be sent to zero by tuning the input parameters .",
    "it is clear from the previous discussion that there exists a value of the charge @xmath102 that gives @xmath111 , but perhaps a more natural parameter to tune is @xmath0 . considering a small @xmath0",
    "we see that there is a negligible positive contribution proportional to @xmath112 , and two terms coupled to cosines of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for small @xmath0",
    "the @xmath113 term dominates and hence enforces @xmath114 .",
    "nonetheless @xmath63 is still free to align such that the coefficient of @xmath0 is negative .",
    "thus a model with a small @xmath0 will always result in a lower minimum than the same model with @xmath115 . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 can be tuned such that @xmath111 , assuming that a @xmath102 is chosen such that when @xmath115 the minimum is positive .",
    "we present numerical results and provide approximate , analytic justifications of the results seen .",
    "@xmath116    in the tables @xmath117 is the cosmological constant and all dimensionful quantities are given in gev except for the field vevs which are quoted in units in which @xmath118 .",
    "finally , note that the masses quoted are not the masses of the fundamental fields , for which the mass matrix is not diagonal .",
    "instead the masses are labelled by the fundamental field that makes up the largest component of that mass eigenstate .",
    "@xmath119     and all other fields are fixed at their minimum values . ]    , but with @xmath53 removed for clarity and again , @xmath118 and all other fields are at their minima . ]",
    "we see that the two models , with similar input parameter values , produce remarkably similar output , but with a few important exceptions .",
    "firstly , @xmath120 differs markedly between the two models due to the inflation of the potential by @xmath121 .",
    "secondly , we see that @xmath122 is many orders of magnitude larger when the d - term is cancellable .",
    "this appears because , despite @xmath53 and its first derivative being negligible , the second derivative of @xmath53 is naturally planck scale .",
    "notice that the vev of @xmath59 is essentially the same in both models with the potential having a very similar form as seen in figures [ fig : noncan ] and [ fig : can ] .",
    "the shows that , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx_t_vev ] ) yields @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the non - cancellable and cancellable cases respectively , we can conclude that the approximation that the minimum is given by @xmath125 , and hence eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx_t_vev ] ) , is valid for these input parameters .",
    "it is clear that , despite the differences between the models , the fine tuning of @xmath126 to zero can be readily achieved in both cases .",
    "the methods of cancellation differ considerably between the two models and it is necessary to consider them separately .",
    "firstly we consider the effect of the cancellable d - term . in this case by setting @xmath115 and then varying @xmath102 we see that a small enough charge will lift the potential to be positive .",
    "if a small @xmath0 is then introduced , the phases will align to ensure that the cross terms produce a negative contribution to the potential ( the @xmath112 terms have negligible effect ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated numerically that even small values of @xmath0 , such as @xmath127 , will produce a negative cosmological constant , assuming that @xmath128 , while @xmath115 gives @xmath129 .",
    "hence for some value of @xmath0 in the range @xmath130 it follows that @xmath111 for @xmath131 .",
    "when varying @xmath0 to tune @xmath79 to zero it is clear that the value of @xmath120 is essentially independent of the tuning . to be more precise , near @xmath132 the addition of a small @xmath133 will make @xmath134 whereas subtracting @xmath133 will give @xmath129",
    ". this will be true in the limit that @xmath135 , whereas @xmath136 in this limit .",
    "finally we see that because susy is always broken due to the effects of the meson fields @xmath111 has to be obtained by a cancellation between @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "this shows that @xmath111 implies a finite @xmath120 if @xmath59 stabilises .    in the simple models given here the phase of the field @xmath96 has no potential whatsoever .",
    "however , it is clear that one can add a nontrivial superpotential @xmath137 to stabilise the phase without affecting stabilisation and cancellation , as long as its expectation value remains smaller than @xmath138 .",
    "the non - cancellable d - term lifting is both indirect and direct , with the direct lifting from the positive definite contribution to the potential introduced by @xmath53 .",
    "the indirect effect of the non - cancellable d - term is similar to the cancellable d - term s , the argument of the d - term is driven to zero , which necessarily moves @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath59 away from the minimum of @xmath139 and f - term lifting occurs .",
    "in addition to this effect the d - term provides direct lifting analogous to the original kklt models , with both of these effects being controlled by the size of @xmath54 .",
    "hence varying @xmath54 allows the tuning of @xmath111 .    since",
    ", in the large @xmath59 limit , @xmath53 is approximately given by @xmath140 , it is clear that , in this limit , @xmath141 , whereas the exponential dependence of @xmath71 ensures that , in this limit , @xmath142 .",
    "since @xmath143 is of the same order as @xmath144 and @xmath79 is tuned to zero , @xmath145 implies that @xmath53 should be of the same order as @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that @xmath146 , implies that @xmath147 .",
    "as a result the d - term does not disturb the minimum of @xmath59 .",
    "the same is not true for @xmath60 and @xmath61 since @xmath53 , @xmath71 and @xmath70 are all polynomial functions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( ignoring the @xmath148 factor which is irrelevant to this discussion ) and so , very roughly has a much larger first derivatives than @xmath70 due to the effect of the khler derivatives . ] , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath53 and @xmath71 have comparable effects on the minima of @xmath152 so as a result we expect the minima to shift upon the introduction of @xmath53 .",
    "the issue of fine - tuning necessary to achieve satisfactory degree of hierarchy between the moduli masses , gravitino mass and the scale of cosmological constant has been revisited in the context of supergravities with consistent d - terms .",
    "we have studied models where supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilisation can not be separated from each other : unlike in the models considered in @xcite supersymmetry breaking , for finite field vevs , is mandatory .",
    "it turns out that even in such a case the realistic hierarchy can be achieved on the expense of a single fine - tuning . in models with cancellable d - terms",
    "the tuned parameter turns out to be the constant term in the superpotential , in models with non - cancellable d - term tuning can be restricted to the @xmath18-charges of moduli .",
    "we have studied a refined mechanism of supersymmetric f - term uplifting in the presence of consistent d - terms .",
    "we have employed the racetrack scheme enhanced by a constant term in the superpotential .",
    "in contrast to the original kklt construction minimisation is not due to cancellation between @xmath0 and the modulus field , but between the separate condensate terms .",
    "in addition we introduce a spectator charged scalar . as a result ,",
    "we can easily , without any dramatic tree - level hierarchy among the dimensionful parameters of the lagrangian , achieve nearly vanishing positive or negative ( or zero ) cosmological constant with all moduli stabilised and small gravitino mass .",
    "the d - terms vanish at the interesting minima , and the cancellation of the negative latexmath:[$-3 e^k    to zero in the minimum the d - term has a large effect on the mass matrix , inducing a large splitting in the moduli mass spectrum .",
    "the existence of a state heavier than the condensation scale is consistent with the fact that stabilisation results from the interplay between the gauge sector and gravity - suppressed contributions .",
    "a distinct feature of the model discussed here is that except @xmath0 , which removes a zero eigenvalue from the mass matrix , all scales in the hidden sector are dynamically generated via running of field dependent gauge couplings , as implied by string theory , in contrast to models with iss - type hidden sectors considered earlier @xcite .",
    "perturbing the model by a small ( smaller than @xmath154 ) superpotential , @xmath137 , for the extra charged scalar does nt materially affect the results . finally , the amount of tuning necessary in the models discussed here is comparable to those in @xcite .",

    "<S> the issue of fine - tuning necessary to achieve satisfactory degree of hierarchy between moduli masses , the gravitino mass and the scale of the cosmological constant has been revisited in the context of supergravities with consistent d - terms . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied ( extended ) racetrack models where supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilisation can not be separated from each other . </S>",
    "<S> we show that even in such cases the realistic hierarchy can be achieved on the expense of a single fine - tuning . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of two condensates changes the role of the constant term in the superpotential , @xmath0 , and solutions with small vacuum energy and large gravitino mass can be found even for very small values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> models where d - terms are allowed to vanish at finite vevs of moduli fields - denoted ` cancellable ' d - terms - and the ones where d - terms may vanish only at infinite vevs of some moduli - denoted ` non - cancellable ' - differ markedly in their properties . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the tuning with respect to the planck scale required in the case of cancellable d - terms is much weaker than in the case of non - cancellable ones . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that , against intuition , a vanishing d - term can trigger f - term uplifting of the vacuum energy due to the stringent constraint it imposes on vacuum expectation values of charged fields . finally we note that our models only rely on two dimensionful parameters : @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>"
