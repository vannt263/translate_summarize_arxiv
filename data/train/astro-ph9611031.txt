    "metal - rich absorption line systems (  and , damped   and 21 cm systems ) are a very powerful tool for studying the statistical properties of high - redshift young galaxies , otherwise very difficult to detect directly , but it must be ascertained which kind of population does indeed probe each type of system .",
    "the large column density absorbers giving rise to high - redshift damped  absorption lines in quasar spectra are generally assumed to trace proto - galactic disks ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) , whereas  absorptions at intermediate redshifts trace the gaseous halos of luminous field galaxies ( bergeron & boiss 1991 , thereafter bb91 ; steidel 1993 ) with typically radii of the order of @xmath15  kpc ( where @xmath16 is the hubble constant in units of 50  mpc@xmath5 , and using @xmath6 ) .",
    "the main arguments that have led to associate the damped  systems ( dlas ) with the progenitors of present - day gas - rich galaxies are related to their mass density ( wolfe 1987 ) and to their metal content ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) . nevertheless , the population producing the damped  absorption lines is not yet unambiguously identified since the systems detected in the optical range are at too high redshifts ( @xmath17 ) to easily detect the absorber by its emission , both because of its apparent faintness and its proximity to the quasar image .",
    "the aim of this project is to determine the magnitude , morphology , color and extent of the  component of the galaxies causing 21 cm / damped   absorption at intermediate redshift and investigate whether these absorptions probe galactic disks , gaseous halos or elongated whisp - like structures as in ngc 3067/3c  232 ( carilli & van gorkom 1989 ) .",
    "this program is a first step towards relating the properties of present - day and intermediate - redshift gas - rich galaxies .",
    "when the project was undertaken , only a few 21 cm absorbers at intermediate redshift were known and no damped  system had yet been discovered at @xmath18 from ultraviolet observations . as photoionization modeling had shown that  systems with very strong  associated absorption should have  column densities in excess of a few 10@xmath19 @xmath10 ( bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) , which is indeed the case for 21  cm absorbers , we also selected absorption systems displaying this property .",
    "high spatial resolution images of the selected quasar fields were taken with the hst - wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , and uv spectroscopy was obtained with the hst - fos to derive the  column densities , the gas temperature for the 21  cm absorbers , and to set constraints on the heavy element abundances .",
    "the selected quasars exhibit at least one of the following properties :    * a 21  cm absorption : 3c  196 , pks  1229@xmath12021 and 3c  286 , * a high rest - frame equivalent width ratio @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 : ex  0302@xmath12223 , q  1209 + 107 , pks  0454 + 039 , mc  1331 + 170 , * a damped  line at higher redshift : mc  1331 + 170 , * a galaxy very close to the quasar sightline : pks  1229@xmath12021 ( bergeron , unpublished cfht observations ) , q  1209 + 107 ( arnaud et al . 1988 ) , 3c  196 ( boiss & boulade 1990 ) .",
    "four of these quasar fields have been previously studied with either the hst wide field camera 2 ( 3c  196 : cohen et al .",
    "1996 ) or ground - based telescopes ( pks  1229@xmath12021 and 3c  286 : steidel et al . 1994a , pks  0454 + 039 : steidel et al .",
    "1995 ) . in each case , a candidate absorber was detected and these results will be discussed and compared to our higher spatial - resolution observations in sect .",

    "several exposures were obtained ( at least four for the f702w images ) , to allow a better rejection of the cosmic rays events and to minimize saturation of the quasar .",
    "in fact , the number of cosmic rays is important ( about 1300 per pc2 field for a 900  s exposure ) , and more than three exposures are necessary to properly remove them .",
    "the hot and corrupted pixels , which appear on all the exposures , have been removed using the chart provided by the stsci .",
    "the remaining hot pixels are removed using an adapted median filter .",
    "the detection and classification of the objects present in the pc2 fields were made using the software source extractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , which offers very robust object detection , high quality deblending , and good object classification . for the detection ,",
    "only two parameters have to be specified : the threshold for the detection and the parameter that controls the deblending of the objects , which depends on the dynamics of the detector .",
    "the classification of the objects is quite satisfactory , even for the slightly under - sampled images of the wfpc2 .",
    "the @xmath48 detection threshold , as defined in sextractor , refers to the total flux of an object concentrated and averaged over 9 pixels , where @xmath49 is the rms fluctuation per pixel of the background .",
    "for the pc2 sampling , this threshold corresponds to a @xmath50 detection limit for an unresolved object .",

    "the @xmath48 detection threshold allows to discriminate between very faint stars and cosmic rays events , and to include low surface brightness extended objects .",

    "such a value is consistent with the limit of completeness of the fields , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the dotted line indicates the counts of the deep imaging survey of le brun et al .",
    "the excess in the bins at magnitudes lower than 22 are statistical fluctuations due to the low number of galaxies in these bins ( at most 7 ) , while the excess between @xmath55 and @xmath56 may be real , and probably due to the presence of some groups near three sightlines , 3c  196 , pks 1229@xmath12021 , and , at a lower degree , q  1209 + 107 ( see sects . 3.3 , 3.5 and 3.4 ) . however , the bins between @xmath56 and @xmath57 follow the average distribution , and the break occuring in the bin at @xmath58 indicates that the completeness limit of our data is about @xmath59 .",
    "the complete analysis of the galaxy populations of the fields , including the wfc2 data , will be made in a subsequent paper .",
    "all apparent magnitudes are given in these filters .",
    "for absolute magnitudes , @xmath60-corrections from observed @xmath61 to rest - frame @xmath1 magnitude were estimated using the templates given by coleman et al .",
    "we used an sbc type for all spirals discussed in the paper , and i m type for the amorphous and/or low - surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the @xmath60-corrections relative to peculiar objects ( e.g the compact absorber candidates ) are discussed in the text . however ,",
    "elliptical types have not been considered , since the presence of large quantities of gas ( ascertained by the dlas ) makes this type unlikely for these objects .",
    "the damped  absorbers are most probably located very close to the quasar sightline .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to search for galaxies superimposed onto the quasar image .",
    "since we have observed several quasars through the same filter , and roughly at the same location on the pc2 detector , we have been able to construct an empirical point spread function ( psf ) . for the subtraction to the quasar image ,",
    "the latter gives better results than those obtained using a library of theoretical psfs provided by the stsci .    to construct the psf in an iterative way",
    ", we have selected for the first step the quasar field for which the candidate absorber is well resolved from the quasar image , i.e. q  1209 + 107 ( see fig .",
    "[ q1209field ] ) . to obtain a first iteration clean psf together with a reasonable sampling of the background",
    ", we have removed the image of the galaxy adjacent on the sky to the quasar image and put the corresponding pixels at the average value of the surrounding background .",
    "this initial psf has then been used for subtraction to a second image also barely saturated , i.e pks  1229@xmath12021 , after recentering and rescaling . the scaling factor has been estimated from the flux ratio in the wings of the quasars , excluding the saturated central pixels . as the resulting frame does not include a strong extended source close to the field center , the detected individual objects are clearly resolved from any residual pattern due to psf subtraction .",
    "this frame has then been cleaned , all residuals but the objects being put at the average value of the background ( in fact set to zero for building the psf frames ) , and subsequently subtracted from the original quasar image to obtain a second psf frame .",
    "the latter is then averaged with the initial psf .",
    "the resulting psf is then used to analyze the next quasar image .",
    "we thus obtained a psf built with four point source images of various intensities , always located close to the center of the pc2 , and therefore suffering no differential optical distortions .",
    "the images of 3c  196 and 3c  286 were not used since , in both cases , there is clearly an extended underlying object that could not be properly resolved from the psf residuals .",
    "the image of pks  0454 + 039 was not used either , because the very important residuals can not be clearly ascribed to either the psf or an underlying object , this being most probably due to the high saturation level of the quasar .",
    "only the very central parts of the frames obtained after subtraction of the final psf show high residuals due to saturation of the initial quasar frames . in each case",
    ", we can ascertain the existence of faint objects ( @xmath62 ) down to 0.3  from the quasar center ( e.g. q  1209 + 107 ) , i.e. @xmath63  kpc at @xmath3 , or 0.5  for the most saturated quasars ( e.g. ex  0302@xmath12223 ) .",

    "1996 ) +    in our study , we find several cases of galaxies very close on the sky to background quasars and with redshifts of about 0.5 ( if these galaxies are assumed to be the damped  absorbers ) .",
    "this is an ideal situation in which multiple images of the quasar induced by gravitational deflection may be expected .",
    "further , since we have deep and high - spatial resolution frames , secondary images of the qsos induced by the absorber could be found easily , even if the angular separation to the primary image and the image flux ratio are small .",
    "however , in none of the investigated fields do we find any evidence for multiple images . in some cases",
    ", a faint secondary image may be difficult to find if it appeared superimposed onto the image of the intervening galaxy ( 3c  196 , 3c  286 ) .",
    "for pks  1229@xmath12021 , object # 2 could have been a secondary image but , it is much more likely to be intrinsic emission from the jet , as indicated by the remarkable coincidence between the optical and radio knots ( see sect .  [ sec1229 ] ) . around pks  0454 + 039 and q  1209 + 107 for instance",
    ", we estimate that we can rule out the presence of an unresolved object at an angular distance exceeding 0.4  from the quasar and with a flux ratio to the primary image greater than about 0.001 . among the confirmed gravitational lenses ( see e.g. refsdal & surdej 1994 ) , angular separations and flux ratio well above these limits have been observed .",
    "this already tells us that the mass of the dark halo in these lensing galaxies is much larger than that of the ordinary `` absorption - selected '' galaxies discussed in this study .",
    "our negative result is also consistent with the fact that in gravitational lenses , several galaxies are often at work to produce the multiple images .",
    "we thus note that our data could be used to set tight constraints on the mass and/or mass distribution of the absorbing galaxies .",
    "this would require a detailed analysis of each individual case , which is beyond the scope of this study .",
