    "we begin with an overview of the field , then briefly introduce subatomic particles and their detection before treating particle detectors in more detail .",
    "we conclude with two examples that illustrate how a variety of detectors work together in typical high - energy - physics experiments .    the experimental study of subatomic particles and their interactions has revealed an unexpected layer of substructure underlying the atomic nucleus and",

    "while there is much variation among spectrometers , generally they measure the trajectories and energies of subatomic particles passing through them . in a typical experiment",
    ", a beam of subatomic particles is brought into collision with another particle beam or with a stationary target .",
    "interactions between particles yield reaction products , some of which pass through the spectrometer",
    ". measurements can include the momentum , angle , energy , mass , velocity , and decay distance of reaction products .",
    "particle detection techniques pioneered in high - energy physics have received broad application outside of that field .",
    "important examples include nuclear physics , astronomy , medical imaging , x - ray scattering , diffraction , and spectroscopy , and the use of synchrotron radiation in biophysics , biochemistry , materials science , and the semiconductor industry @xcite .",
    "( there has of course been intellectual traffic in both directions , e.g.  the pioneering use of semiconductor detectors in nuclear physics and of ccds in astronomy  @xcite . )",
    "subatomic particles include the familiar electron , proton , and neutron which are the components of the atom .",
    "in addition , dozens of less stable particles have been discovered since the 1930s which can be produced in reactions among electrons , protons , and neutrons and subsequently decay in a variety of ways .",
    "each particle is characterized by a unique set of values for mass , electric charge , average lifetime , etc .",
    "subatomic particles also possess a property called spin , which differs from the classical concept of angular momentum in that it is quantized ( in units of @xmath0 ) and immutable .",

    "commonly used in high - energy physics . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     quarks are bound together into hadrons by the strong force .",
    "this is observed to occur in two ways : a quark can bind to an antiquark to form a meson or antimeson , and three quarks or antiquarks can bind together to form a baryon or antibaryon .",
    "bare quarks , as well as combinations of quarks other than those just mentioned , have never been observed and are presumed to be forbidden by the laws governing the strong force .",
    "( the possible existence of hadrons made up entirely of gluons is a subject of current experimental investigation but has not been definitively established . )",
    "subatomic particles can be detected via their interactions with bulk matter .",
    "most particles can interact via more than one of the four forces ( in order of decreasing interaction strength ) strong , electromagnetic , weak , and gravitational .",
    "it is typically the stronger forces that give the most dramatic and easily detectable signals .",
    "since subatomic particles have such small masses , the gravitational force is entirely useless for their detection .",
    "all charged particles can be detected via the electromagnetic force , since they ionize nearby atoms as they pass through matter .",
    "neutrinos ( which as neutral leptons  feel \" only the weak and gravitational forces ) are exceedingly difficult to detect directly , and their production is typically inferred via conservation of momentum and energy by observing that some of the momentum and energy present before a reaction are missing in the final state .",
    "detectors that measure particle position can be arranged as  hodoscopes \" or  telescopes . \"",
    "hodoscopes are arrays of adjacent detectors typically used to measure the position of a particle along a direction perpendicular to the particle s path .",
    "telescopes are arrays of detectors arranged sequentially along the particle s path so as to track the motion of the particle .",
    "commonly used position - sensitive detectors include scintillation counters , solid - state detectors , proportional tubes , and multiwire proportional and drift chambers .",
    "these produce electrical signals which can be digitized and processed in real time or recorded for further analysis using high - speed digital computers .",
    "specialized detectors less commonly used nowadays include the cloud chamber and bubble chamber , in which measurements are made continually as the particle traverses an extended gaseous or liquid medium , the spark chamber , and stacks of photographic emulsion .",
    "these detectors typically produce information on photographic film which must be processed optically , requiring scanning and measurement by trained personnel .        in a magnetic field ,",
    "charged particles follow helical trajectories .",
    "the radius of curvature is proportional to the particle momentum and inversely proportional to the particle charge and the field strength . given the radius @xmath1 in meters , momentum @xmath2 in gev/@xmath3 , charge @xmath4 in units of the electron charge , and field strength @xmath5 in tesla , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle between the field direction and the particle momentum vector . from measurements of the curvature of the particle track within the field , the momentum can thus be determined . even if no measurements are made within the field , the curvature within it ( and hence the momentum )",
    "can be inferred by measuring the particle s trajectory before and after it traverses the field .",
    "the magnetic field , typically in the range one to two tesla , is generally produced using an electromagnet , which may be air - core or solid and have conventional ( copper or aluminum ) or superconducting coils .",
    "calorimeters are detectors of thickness sufficient to absorb as large a fraction as possible of the kinetic energy of an incident particle . while for electrons and hadrons this fraction can approach 100% , there is usually some leakage of energy out the back of a calorimeter .",
    "an electrical signal is produced proportional to the deposited energy . unlike tracking detectors",
    ", calorimeters can detect neutral as well as charged particles .",
    "calorimeters also play an important role in electron identification and are sometimes used for muon identification , as described next .      of the charged subatomic particles , five are sufficiently stable to travel many meters at the energies typical in high - energy physics ( one gev to several hundred gev ) , so that their trajectories can be easily measured in a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the problem of particle identification is thus that of distinguishing among these five particles : electrons , muons , pions , kaons , and protons . in experiments that identify particles ,",
    "multiple particle - identification techniques are typically used together in order to enhance the efficiency of identification and lower the probability of misidentification .      as discussed in more detail in secs .",
    "[ sec : radlength ] and [ sec : calorim ] , in material of high atomic number ( @xmath8 ) , high - energy electrons create characteristic electromagnetic showers consisting of a cascade of photons , electrons , and anti - electrons ( positrons ) .",
    "thus the pattern of energy deposition in a calorimeter , as well as the correlation of deposited energy with magnetically - measured momentum , can be used to distinguish electrons from other charged particles . in a calorimeter",
    "optimized for this purpose , @xmath9-@xmath10 rejection of @xmath11 can be achieved ( i.e.  only @xmath11 of pions mistaken for electrons )  @xcite , while maintaining @xmath12% efficiency for electrons ( i.e.  only 25% of electrons rejected as having ambiguous identification ) @xcite .    since high - energy photons also create electromagnetic showers in high-@xmath8 materials , electromagnetic calorimetry",
    "can also be used to identify photons and measure their energy .",
    "photons are distinguishable from electrons since they do not give observable tracks in tracking telescopes .",
    "muons ( and also neutrinos ) are distinguished from other charged particles by their low probability to interact with nuclei : muons can pass through many meters of iron while depositing only ionization energy .",
    "a muon can thus be identified efficiently and with little background , with typical @xmath13-@xmath10 rejection of order @xmath14  @xcite , by its failure to shower in a calorimeter . often for muon identification , instead of a full calorimeter ,",
    "a crude structure is used consisting of thick shielding layers of steel or concrete insterspersed with detectors ; an example of such a muon - identification system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hypercp ] .      at momenta up to a few gev/@xmath3 , particle velocity can be measured well enough for particle identification using time - of - flight measurement over a distance of order meters  @xcite .",
    "this is typically accomplished using thick ( several cm ) scintillation counters ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : scint ] ) to determine flight time to a fraction of a ns .",
    "this information is often augmented by repeated measurements of ionization rate in proportional chambers since ( as described in sec .  [",
    "sec : eloss ] ) the rate of ionization in a medium is velocity dependent .",
    "if a particle s momentum is known from magnetic spectroscopy , measurement of its velocity determines its mass .",
    "the velocity can be measured ( or limits can be placed on it ) using the cherenkov effect , by which a charged particle moving through a transparent medium at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium emits photons at a characteristic velocity - dependent angle .",
    "( this process is mathematically analogous to the emission of sonic boom by a supersonic object or the creation of a bow wave by a fast - moving boat . )",
    "the speed of light in a medium is slower than the speed of light in vacuum by the factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the medium s refractive index .",
    "threshold cherenkov counters  @xcite determine limits on a particle s speed by establishing that the particle does or does not emit cherenkov photons in media of various refractive indices .",
    "several threshold cherenkov counters with appropriately chosen thresholds can be used together to distinguish pions , kaons , and protons within a given momentum range .",
    "this technique is typically useful from about 1 gev/@xmath3 up to several tens of gev/@xmath3 .",
    "ring - imaging cherenkov counters  @xcite measure the particle s speed by determining the photon emission angle directly , and can be used up to a few hundred gev/@xmath3 .    note that cherenkov detectors are hardly useful for muon identification , since muons and pions are so similar in mass that their cherenkov thresholds ( and photon emission angles ) are nearly indistinguishable in practice .",
    "transition radiation consists of photons emitted when a charged particle crosses an interface between media of differing refractive index .",
    "particles with  highly relativistic \" velocity ( i.e.  with kinetic energy greatly exceeding their mass energy ) produce detectable numbers of  soft \" x - rays ( energy of order a few kev ) when traversing stacks of thin metal or plastic foils typically including hundreds of interfaces .",
    "these x - rays can be detected in proportional chambers and used for @xmath9-@xmath10 discrimination at momenta exceeding 1 gev/@xmath3 and hadron ( @xmath17 ) identification up to a few hundred gev/@xmath3  @xcite . using calorimetry and transition - radiation detection together , @xmath9-@xmath10 rejection of @xmath18",
    "has been achieved  @xcite .",
    "since subatomic - particle spectrometers deal with the smallest objects we know of , they encounter directly the statistical aspects of quantum mechanics and the  microworld . \"",
    "it is a striking feature of the laws of quantum mechanics that they do not predict the outcome of individual particle reactions , but only particle behavior on the average .",
    "nevertheless , most aspects of particle detection can be understood using classical physics , and quantum uncertainty is rarely a dominant contribution to measurement error .      as a first example , if we consider a proton colliding elastically with another proton , classical physics predicts exactly the scattering angle as a function of the impact parameter ( the distance between the centers of the protons measured perpendicular to the line of flight ) .",
    "however , quantum mechanically the proton is described not as a hard sphere with a well - defined radius , but rather as a wave packet , with the square of the wave s amplitude at any point in space giving the probability for the proton to be at that location .",
    "the impact parameter in any given collision is thus an ill - defined quantity .",
    "it is not necessary to delve into the mathematical complexities of quantum mechanics to realize that in this situation the scattering angle for a given encounter is a random and unpredictable quantity .",
    "what the laws of quantum mechanics in fact predict is the _ probability _ for a proton to scatter through any given angle , in other words , the scattering - angle _ distribution_. the random nature of quantum mechanics underlies heisenberg s famous uncertainty relations , which give the fundamental limits to the accuracy with which any quantity can be measured .",
    "next we consider an _",
    "in_elastic collision between two protons , in which one or both protons emerge in excited states that decay into multiple - particle final states .",
    "this is a common type of interaction event of interest in high - energy physics , since from the properties and probability distributions of the final state can be inferred various properties of the protons , their constituent quarks and gluons , and the interactions among them . in",
    "any given encounter between two protons , whether an inelastic collision will take place can not in principle be predicted , nor , if so , what particles will be produced and with what momentum and spin vectors .",
    "what quantum mechanics _ does _ predict ( in principle ) is the _ distributions _ of these quantities over a large number of collisions .",
    "however , since we do not yet have a completely satisfactory theory of the strong force , these distributions can not as yet be predicted in detail from  first principles . \"",
    "one should note that uncertainty in the outcome or measurement of an event is often not quantum - mechanical in origin .",
    "for example , even classically , the angle of elastic scattering of a given proton incident on a target is in practice not predictable , since it is not feasible to measure the position of the proton with respect to the scattering nucleus with sufficient precision to know the impact parameter .",
    "thus even a classical analysis of the problem predicts only the scattering - angle distribution .      when measurement yields a distribution for some parameter rather than a definite value , we can characterize the quality of the measurement by the width of the distribution , i.e.  the measurement _ resolution _ or uncertainty .",
    "common ways of characterizing the width of a distribution are the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation and the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "of course , if looked at in fine enough detail , any measurement yields a distribution , though the distribution may be extremely narrow in some cases .",
    "a broad distribution in the result of some measurement can reflect quantum - mechanical uncertainty or simply lack of knowledge of the exact input state .",
    "we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : spect ] examples of both classical and quantum contributions to measurement resolution .      for the designer of particle spectrometry systems ,",
    "a consequence of these uncertainties is that randomness must be taken into account .",
    "for example , one might be designing data - acquisition equipment for an experiment intended to operate at an event rate of 100 khz .",
    "this means that on average one has 10 @xmath13s to acquire and process the information from each event , but the actual number of events occurring in a given time interval will be random and characterized by a poisson probability distribution ( see eq.[eq : poisson ] ) .",
    "thus if a large fraction of all events are to be captured , data acquisition for each event must be accomplished in a time that is short compared to 10 @xmath13s ( in this example ) , to keep sufficiently small the probability that a second event occurs while the first is being processed .",
    "all detectors of subatomic particles operate by virtue of the energy lost by charged particles as they traverse matter .",
    "charged particles lose energy in matter by several mechanisms .",
    "these include ionization of nearby atoms , bremsstrahlung ( emission of photons in the electric field of an atomic nucleus ) , cherenkov and transition radiation , and strong nuclear interactions .",
    "for all charged particles except electrons , ionization typically dominates over other mechanisms .",
    "the key challenge to particle detection is amplification of the small signals ( typically tens to thousands of photons or electrons ) produced by these mechanisms .",
    "the rate @xmath19 of ionization energy loss by a charged particle passing through material depends primarily on the particle s speed , or more precisely on the quantity @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the particle s speed expressed as a fraction of the speed of light in vacuum , and the  time dilation factor \" @xmath22 .",
    "( note that @xmath23 reduces to @xmath24 in the non - relativistic limit @xmath25 . )",
    "the rate of ionization is given by the bethe - bloch equation ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization ] , slow particles are heavily ionizing .",
    "the rate of ionization energy loss drops with increasing @xmath23 approximately as @xmath26 , to a minimum at a value of @xmath23 that depends only slightly on the material .",
    "the ionization minimum is at @xmath27 for nitrogen , which decreases to @xmath28 for high-@xmath8 materials such as lead .",
    "4 in    while @xmath19 per unit thickness varies substantially among materials , if the thickness is divided by density , thus being expressed as mass per unit area , the strongest part of the dependence on material is eliminated . for particles of charge @xmath9 ( except electrons ) , and for all materials except hydrogen , the energy - loss rates at the ionization minimum range from 1 to 2 mev/(g/@xmath29 ) . for @xmath23 above minimum - ionizing ,",
    "the ionization energy - loss rate rises approximately logarithmically . at @xmath30 ,",
    "the loss rate is less than double relative to its minimum at @xmath31 . in this",
    "ultra - relativistic regime radiative energy loss ( bremsstrahlung ) becomes significant relative to ionization .      in materials of high atomic number",
    ", there is a high probability per unit length for electromagnetic radiative processes to occur , i.e.  for electrons to radiate photons by bremsstrahlung and for photons to convert into electron - positron pairs in the electric field of a nucleus .",
    "this probability is characterized by the  radiation length \" @xmath32 of the material , defined as the thickness of material in which a high - energy electron will lose all but a fraction @xmath33 of its initial energy  @xcite .",
    "radiation length also characterizes the degree to which charged particles scatter randomly , due to multiple encounters with the electric fields of nuclei , in passing through material .",
    "if precise measurement of particle trajectories is to be achieved , this scattering effect must be minimized .",
    "materials with short radiation length ( e.g.  lead , @xmath34 cm , and tungsten , @xmath35 cm ) are thus desirable for use in electromagnetic sampling calorimeters ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : calorim ] ) and in some shielding applications , but in general should be avoided in other particle - detection contexts .",
    "scintillators  @xcite are materials in which some of the ionization energy lost by a charged particle along its trajectory is converted into light via fluorescence .",
    "the light may be detected in a variety of ways , including ( most commonly ) photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) and solid - state photodetectors .",
    "both organic and inorganic scintillators are in use .",
    "organic scintillators typically consist of aromatic liquids dissolved in a plastic such as polystyrene , polyvinyltoluene , or polymethylmethacrylate .",
    "liquid scintillators , more common in the past , have generally been abandoned in high - energy physics ( except in specialized applications ) in favor of the plastics , which offer greater ease of use .",
    "a common configuration is a piece of plastic of few mm to few cm thickness , few to several cm width , and length ranging from several cm to a few meters , glued at one end to a plastic  light guide \" which is in turn glued to or butted against the entrance window of a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) .    a minimum - ionizing charged particle traversing the plastic deposits ionization energy at a rate of about 2 mev/(g/@xmath29 ) .",
    "as the ionized plastic molecules de - excite , they emit ultraviolet photons , most of which are quickly reabsorbed by the plastic . to provide a detectable light signal , the plastic is doped with a low concentration of dissolved aromatic  wavelength shifters \" ( fluors ) such as @xmath2-terphenyl , 3-hydroxyflavone , and tetraphenylbutadiene .",
    "these absorb in the ultraviolet and re - emit at visible wavelengths , where the plastic is transparent .",
    "( since there is inevitably some overlap between the wavelength - shifter absorption and emission bands , too large a concentration of wavelength shifter would result in excessive attenuation of the light signal as it travels towards the photodetector . )    in a counter of large length - to - width ratio , light collection is inherently inefficient , since only a narrow range of emission angle is subtended by the photodetector .",
    "furthermore , the light is attenuated by absorption along the length of the counter .",
    "light is typically emitted at a rate of about 1 photon per 100 ev of ionization energy , but often only a few percent of these reach the photodetector , where additional losses may be incurred due to reflection at the interfaces .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the photodetector further reduces the signal . for a pmt",
    ", the quantum efficiency is the probability that an incident photon causes the emission of an electron from the photocathode .",
    "the typical pmt visible - light quantum efficiency is about 20% , but solid - state photodetectors can have quantum efficiencies approaching 100%  @xcite .",
    "since photodetectors are subject to single - electron shot noise , the typical signal - to - noise ratio in a plastic scintillation counter of about 1 cm thickness is of order 10 to 100 .    with fast fluors ,",
    "the light signal develops quite rapidly ( rise times of order ns ) .",
    "instantaneous counting rates of order 10 mhz can be sustained . with high - speed pmts",
    ", thick scintillators can achieve sub - nanosecond timing accuracy , ideal for time - of - flight particle identification .",
    "average counting rates are limited by the current ratings of the pmt and base . in high - counting - rate applications ,",
    "transistorized bases  @xcite are crucial to avoid  sagging \" of the dynode voltages .      in recent years advances in photodetectors and in the manufacture of plastic optical fibers",
    "have made scintillating optical fibers a practical detector for precision particle tracking at high rates  @xcite .",
    "scintillating fibers work by trapping scintillation light through total internal reflection . since the fibers are typically less than 1 mm in diameter , detection of the scintillation signal is technically challenging : the ionization signal is only of order @xmath36 photons and the light trapping efficiency of order 1% . to convert the scintillation photons efficiently to visible light , wavelength shifters of large  stokes shift \" ( i.e.  large separation between the absorption and emission bands )",
    "are required so that they can be used in sufficiently high concentration ( of order 1% ) without excessive attenuation .",
    "if the light is detected with solid - state cryogenic vlpcs ( visible - light photon counters )  @xcite , advantage can be taken of their 80% quantum efficiency , so that a trapped - photon yield as low as several per minimum - ionizing particle suffices for good detection efficiency ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : poisson ] ) .",
    "fibers as narrow as 800 @xmath13 m in diameter can then be used over lengths of meters  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the large stokes shift is operation in the green region of the visible spectrum ( as opposed to the blue of conventional scintillators ) , so that yellowing of the plastic due to radiation damage in the course of a high - rate experiment has only a slight impact on performance .",
    "inorganic scintillators include doped and undoped transparent crystals such as thallium - doped sodium iodide , bismuth germanate , cesium iodide , and lead tungstate .",
    "they feature excellent energy resolution and are typically employed in electromagnetic calorimetry ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : homog ] ) .",
    "some notable recent applications  @xcite have featured silicon - photodiode readout , allowing installation in the cramped interior of colliding - beam spectrometers as well as operation in high magnetic fields .      developed starting in the 1960s by charpak et al .",
    "@xcite , proportional and drift chambers have largely supplanted visualizing detectors , such as bubble chambers , as the work - horse detectors of high - energy physics due to their higher rate capability and their feasibility of manufacture and operation in large sizes .",

    "installations of these detectors are commonly realized as hodoscopic arrays of anode wires immersed in a suitable gas mixture and arranged so as to detect the ionization energy released when the gas is traversed by a charged particle .",
    "the passage of the particle causes an electrical pulse on the nearest wire , yielding , with the simplest type of signal processing , discrete coordinate measurements ( i.e. , the true position of the particle is approximated by the location of the wire ) .",
    "continuous coordinate measurements can be achieved by more sophisiticated signal processing that provides interpolation between anode wires .",
    "although the primary use of these detectors is for position measurement , they also find use in particle identification in the detection of transition radiation and the measurement of ionization rate ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "many proportional - chamber arrangements have been devised .",
    "the simplest conceptually is the proportional tube , in which a single thin anode wire is operated at a positive potential ( of order kv ) with respect to a surrounding conducting cathode surface .",

    "proportional - tube hodoscopes have long been common in large - area , low - resolution applications such as muon detection  @xcite , and have lately become popular in high - rate applications as the straw - tube array  @xcite . however , a more common arrangement ( which minimizes the detector material by eliminating the tube walls ) is a multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) , consisting of a planar array of anode wires sandwiched between two cathode foils or grids .",
    "although in such a device the electric field near the cathodes approximates a parallel - plate configuration , close to an anode wire the field shape resembles that in a proportional tube ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pwc - field ] ) .",
    "the instrumentation of this detector usually involves individual signal - detecting and coincidence / memory circuits for each anode wire .",
    "4 in    the strength of the mwpc is its ability to handle a high flux of particles while providing good position resolution over a large detector area .",
    "rates above 10@xmath58 particles per @xmath59s have been achieved  @xcite while maintaining greater than 95% detection efficiency .",
    "the rate capability of an mwpc is a strong function of the anode - wire spacing and the anode - cathode gap width , both of which should be as small as possible for high - rate operation .",
    "the statistics of the primary ionization described in eq .",
    "[ eq : poisson ] implies a minimum anode - cathode gap of a few mm for efficient particle detection ( i.e.  for the probability of no ionization to be negligibly small ) . in large detectors the anode - wire spacing and anode - cathode gap",
    "are limited by electromechanical instabilities  @xcite .",
    "thus large mwpcs ( anodes exceeding about 1 m in length ) have typical anode spacing of a few mm , while for anode length under 10 cm , spacing down to 0.5 mm is feasible .",
    "the anode - wire spacing @xmath60 determines the rms position resolution @xmath61 of an mwpc according to @xmath62    this resolution is not always achievable due to the interplay between the pattern - recognition software and the occurrence of clusters of two or more wires registering hits for a single incident particle .",
    "such hit clusters can arise when two adjacent wires share the ionization charge due to a track passing halfway between them , when several adjacent wires share the charge due to an obliquely - inclined track , or when an energetic  knock - on \" electron ( also known as a @xmath63 ray ) is emitted at a large angle by the incident particle and traverses several adjacent wires . when the best position resolution is required",
    "a proper treatment of hit clusters is necessary , but not always possible , leading to inefficiencies in the track reconstruction .",
    "two shortcomings of the mwpc in measuring particle positions are that the anode plane measures only one position coordinate ( the one perpendicular to the wire length ) , and that the measured positions can assume only those values corresponding to anode - wire positions . for minimum - ionizing particles , a common way to provide information in the perpendicular coordinate direction ( i.e.  the distance along the wire ) is to employ several anode planes , each oriented at a different angle , thus viewing the particle trajectory in  stereo \" ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stereo ] ) . in a multiple - particle event , a software algorithm",
    "is then required to match up the signals corresponding to each particle in the various views . in x - ray detection",
    "another method must be used , since x - rays interact in the gas via the photoelectric effect and are thereby absorbed , leaving a signal in only one plane .",
    "a technique for two - dimensional position measurement using only a single anode plane is charge division @xcite , in which the ratio of charges flowing out the two ends of a resistive anode wire specifies the position of the avalanche along the wire .",
    "however , in practice this technique yields only modest resolution ( about 1% of wire length ) .",
    "another technique for two - dimensional measurement of particle position using only one plane of anode wires is cathode readout .",
    "cathode readout also improves position resolution by allowing interpolation between anode wires .",
    "when an avalanche occurs on an anode wire , the pulse induced on the cathode planes carries information about the avalanche location .",
    "if the cathode planes are segmented and the charge induced on each segment digitized , the avalanche location can be accurately determined from the center - of - gravity of the charge distribution .",
    "the simplest arrangement is that of cathode - strip planes . to obtain two - dimensional information ,",
    "one cathode plane can have strips oriented perpendicular to the wire direction ( illustrated in fig.[fig : cathode ] ) , and the other can have strips parallel to the wires .",
    "computation of the center of gravity can be performed either `` off - line '' after the signals have been digitized or `` on - line , '' for example via the transformation of signals from the spatial domain to the time domain using a specially - patterned cathode @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of such delay - line position sensing is , in principle , independent of length .    for cathode strips perpendicular to the wires",
    ", there is a small nonlinearity in position measurement due to the finite strip width  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be mitigated to some extent using specially - shaped segmentation patterns  @xcite . for cathode strips parallel to the wires ,",
    "the measured position is modulated by the discrete positions of the wires around which the ions are created . however , at gains low enough that the avalanche remains in the proportional regime , the angular spread of the avalanche around the wire is limited  @xcite , allowing some interpolation between the wires  @xcite .",
    "typically the position resolution along the wire is of order 100 @xmath13 m and that perpendicular to the wire approximately five times worse .",
    "the accuracy of the center - of - gravity method for cathode readout measuring the coordinate along the wire is at least an order of magnitude better than that of resistive charge division ( for a given signal charge ) . for the coordinate perpendicular to the wire",
    "the electron - drift timing technique discussed in the next section is superior except when ( as in x - ray detection ) a timing reference is not available .",
    "the disadvantages of cathode readout are that it requires a large number of well - calibrated electronic channels and that one is still faced with the problem of correlating the coordinate pairs in a multiple - particle event .",
    "however , the latter problem is mitigated by the availability of a charge  signature . \"",
    "due to the large dynamic range of primary ionization energy , cathode pulses from different particles will tend to differ in total charge , while pulses from the same particle will be correlated in total charge in the two views .",
    "one drawback of the mwpc is the large number of anode wires and associated readout circuits needed to give fine position resolution over a large area .",
    "drift chambers can substantially reduce the wire and electronics - channel counts .",
    "however , the generally wider anode spacing reduces rate capability , and the need for time measurement increases the electronic complexity of each channel .",
    "the idea is to record not only the position of the wire closest to the particle trajectory , but also the distance of the particle from that wire , as measured by the time taken for the ionization electrons to drift along the electric - field lines in to the wire .",
    "one thus records the time of occurrence of the avalanche relative to some reference time tied to the passage of the particle . for minimum - ionizing - particle detection , the reference time",
    "can be provided by a signal from a scintillation counter . given the known drift velocity of the electrons , the drift time determines the distance from the anode wire to an accuracy ( typically 100 to 200 @xmath13 m ) primarily limited by diffusion of the drifting electrons in the gas .",
    "( in special cases , such as high pressure or specially - tailored gas mixtures , the diffusion contribution can be reduced so that the contribution from @xmath64 rays becomes the limiting factor , allowing sub-100 @xmath13 m accuracy . )    in a drift chamber the cathode planes are usually formed by wires at  graded \" potentials , to provide a constant electric field for the drifting electrons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drift ] ) .",
    "use of a gas mixture having a saturated drift velocity reduces the dependence of the position measurement on field inhomogeneities and operating conditions . as in an mwpc , a single anode plane of a drift chamber measures",
    "only the particle coordinate perpendicular to the wire direction . however , there is a two - fold ( so - called  left - right \" ) drift - direction ambiguity , which can be resolved by using several planes of anode wires with positions staggered so as not to lie parallel to a possible particle trajectory .",
    "although not often done , the left - right ambiguity can also be resolved using the asymmetry of induced charge on nearby electrodes mentioned above , assuming the avalanche is sufficiently localized in azimuthal angle around the anode  @xcite .",
    "the particle coordinate along the anode wire can be obtained through similar means as in an mwpc : additional stereo - view planes , charge division , or induced cathode signals . since for drift chambers , position resolution is decoupled from anode - wire spacing , larger wire spacing than in mwpcs is typically used , making them more straightforward to construct and operate .    6.5 in      a time projection chamber  @xcite is a gas - filled chamber in which ionization electrons produced along the path of a charged particle drift over a substantial distance ( several cm to m ) before avalanching and being detected in an array of wire grids . with two - dimensional position measurement ( e.g.anode and cathode readout ) , the entire particle trajectory through the chamber is recorded , with the third dimension  projected \" into drift time .",
    "such detectors are suitable when the average time between events is sufficiently long compared to the drift time and when it is desirable to identify particles via their @xmath19 ionization energy loss as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tofi ] .",
    "radeka  @xcite has analyzed the noise and resolution considerations in amplifiers for proportional chambers .",
    "special operating conditions , such as high rates , bring additional concerns , some of which are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "since the majority of the signal charge stems from the slow motion of the positive ions liberated in the avalanche , one can use eq .",
    "[ eq : green ] to show that the signal current has the form  @xcite @xmath65 assuming that the ions drift within a radial electric field directed outward from the anode . the characteristic time constant @xmath66 ( of order 1 ns ) depends on ion mobility , the electric - field strength at the anode , and the anode - wire diameter .    in high - rate applications",
    "it is desirable to cancel the slow  @xmath67 tail \" in order to be ready for another incident particle as quickly as possible . to do this , elaborate pulse - shaping circuits",
    "are sometimes employed using multiple pole - zero filters  @xcite . with well - designed amplifiers and pulse shapers , typical double - pulse resolution of about 100",
    "ns is feasible .",
    "when designing such a circuit , one should keep in mind that fluctuations ( due to the arrival at the anode of individual ions ) with respect to the average pulse shape make perfect pulse - shaping impossible .",
    "one must also consider that the amplifier is to be connected to a wire operated at kv potential with respect to a surface which may be only a few mm away . while sparks are highly undesirable and may even break a wire , their occurrence can not be ruled out . thus amplifiers should be provided with adequate input protection .    in typical mwpc or drift - chamber operation , the amplifier output ( or the output of a separate pulse - shaping circuit if used )",
    "is conveyed to a `` discriminator '' ( a comparator driving a one - shot ) to produce a logic pulse when an input exceeding threshold occurs .",
    "the discriminator output may be used to set a latch in coincidence with a reference (  gate \" ) signal , as is typically done in mwpc installations .",
    "the readout circuitry then provides a list of wires having signals within the time interval of the reference signal . in drift - chamber operation",
    "one also needs to know the drift time of the ionization electrons ; in this case the time interval between the discriminator output and the reference signal must be digitized .",
    "if cathode readout is desired , the pulse heights on all cathode segments must also be digitized .",
    "the amplifier , pulse - shaper , and discriminator may all be on separate multichannel circuit boards , combined on one or two circuit boards , or even all combined into a single hybrid or integrated circuit .",
    "since for high - rate applications these circuits need to have both large gain and large bandwidth , and each is effectively connected to an imperfectly - shielded antenna ( the anode wire ) , stabilizing large installations against parasitic oscillation is usually challenging and requires careful attention to grounding and circuit and detector layout .",
    "readout of the induced signals on cathodes usually requires longer shaping time , and hence less bandwidth .",
    "this is primarily due to the longer time required for development of the signal , since the induced cathode charge increases as the ions drift away from the screening influence of the nearby anode wire .",
    "nevertheless , since the accurate computation of the center of gravity requires a large dynamic range , to guard against electromagnetic interference and cross - talk , the cautions just mentioned concerning system layout apply here as well .",
    "silicon - strip detectors  @xcite have come into increasing use for tracking applications near the interaction vertex , where tracks are close together and precise position measurements are needed .",
    "these detectors are multiple - diode structures fabricated on single wafers of high - resistivity silicon and operated under reverse bias .",
    "center - to - center distance between adjacent strips as small as 10 @xmath13 m ( 25 to 50 @xmath13 m is common ) allows position resolution an order of magnitude better than that of drift chambers .",
    "the resolution achieved depends on readout mode : with single - bit - per - strip digital readout (  l mwpcs ) the resolution is as given in eq.[eq : res ] , while if analog pulse - height information is used , interpolation between strips is possible because of charge spreading over adjacent strips ; then rms resolution of a few @xmath13 m can be achieved .",
    "a charged particle traversing silicon creates electron - hole pairs from ionization energy at the rate of one pair per 3.6 ev . with typical 300 @xmath13 m detector thickness , the signal is about 25,000 electrons , an order of magnitude smaller than in a proportional chamber .",
    "however , the reduced capacitance of a silicon strip and its associated readout electronics compared to that in an mwpc can allow improved noise performance .",
    "this is especially true for the recently - developed silicon pixel detectors @xcite , in which an individual diode can have dimensions of @xmath68 @xmath13m@xmath69 or less .",
    "compared to strip detectors , pixel detectors also offer ease of track reconstruction , since the firing of a pixel determines a point in space along the particle trajectory rather than a line segment . to achieve efficient and rapid charge collection from the full thickness of the detector",
    "requires fully depleting the diodes , leading to typical operating voltage of about 100 v. the signal out of the @xmath16-type side then develops in a few ns  @xcite . with",
    "fast shaping time , extremely high particle rates ( of order mhz per strip or pixel ) can thus be handled , the limit to rate capability being radiation damage to the detectors and electronics over the long term .    charged - coupled devices ( ccds ) have also been employed for space - point tracking close to the vertex  @xcite . to achieve adequate signal - to - noise ratio",
    "they must be operated with cryogenic cooling .",
    "ccds have the virtue of good position resolution ( @xmath70 @xmath13 m rms ) in both dimensions , at the expense of long ( of order 100 ms ) readout time .",
    "they are thus not well suited to high - rate experiments .",
    "other materials have been considered for strip and pixel particle - position measurement . at present much development effort",
    "is focused on the problem of radiation damage in vertex detectors  @xcite , since silicon detectors commonly become unusable after a few mrad of irradiation .",
    "due to their larger band gaps , materials such as gaas  @xcite or diamond  @xcite should be substantially more radiation - hard than silicon , however they feature worse signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "reverse - biased silicon ( and germanium ) detectors and ccds are also in widespread use for x - ray and synchrotron - radiation detection  @xcite , nuclear physics , etc .    amplifiers and signal - processing circuitry for silicon - strip and pixel detectors present challenges to the designer since the small feature size of the detector implies very large channel counts ( of order 10@xmath71 strips or 10@xmath72 pixels ) in an experiment .",
    "the cost per channel is thus a key design criterion , and , since the circuits often need to be packed into a small volume , so also are circuit size , interconnections , and power dissipation .",
    "various implementations have lately been developed as semi - custom  @xcite and full - custom integrated circuits  @xcite .",
    "pixel detectors necessarily require custom vlsi readout electronics , either integrated onto the detector chip itself  @xcite or as a separate chip bump - bonded to the detector chip  @xcite .",
    "two common types of calorimeter are those optimized for the detection of electrons and photons ( designated  electromagnetic \" ) and those optimized for strongly - interacting particles ( designated  hadronic \" ) .",
    "another important distinction is whether the output signal is proportional to all of the deposited energy or to only a portion of it ; in the latter case the calorimeter is of the  sampling \" type .",
    "a common arrangement for a sampling calorimeter is a sandwich consisting of layers of dense material interspersed with particle detectors such as scintillation counters .",
    "such a calorimeter can be electromagnetic or hadronic depending on the dense material chosen .",
    "often a combined electromagnetic - hadronic device is built , consisting of an initial electromagnetic section using lead plates followed by a hadronic section using iron plates .",
    "lead s short radiation length ( 0.56 cm ) combined with its long ( 17 cm ) mean free path for hadronic interaction means that electrons and hadrons can be well discriminated in such a structure .",
    "electrons interact in the lead producing an electromagnetic shower as they radiate bremsstrahlung photons which produce electron - positron pairs which in turn radiate photons , etc .",
    "almost all of the electron s energy is thus deposited in the electromagnetic section , which is typically about 20 radiation lengths thick . in a well - designed calorimeter , the ionization energy deposited by the shower of electrons and positrons in the interspersed scintillator (",
    " active \" ) layers is proportional to the energy of the incident electron to good approximation .",
    "most hadrons pass through the electromagnetic section leaving only ionization energy and proceed to interact strongly , producing a hadronic shower , in the iron plates of the hadronic section .",
    "energy measurement in sampling calorimeters is limited in resolution due to statistical fluctuations in the ratio of the energy deposited in the active layers to that in the inactive layers .",
    "the percent resolution is inversely proportional to the square - root of the deposited energy .",
    "typical performance for electromagnetic showers is relative rms energy uncertainty @xmath73 ( @xmath74 for hadronic ) , where @xmath41 is expressed in gev . at the highest energies , as this quantity goes to zero , other contributions ( for example , calibration uncertainties ) dominate .",
    "it is difficult to measure energy in sampling calorimeters to better than a few percent .",
    "the poor energy resolution of hadronic sampling calorimeters arises from random fluctuations in the shower composition ( e.g.  in the relative numbers of neutral vs.  charged pions produced ) and from energy loss mechanisms ( such as breakup of nuclei in the inactive layers ) not yielding signal in the sampling medium .",
    "the decay of the neutral pion into a pair of photons converts hadronic energy into electromagnetic energy , which degrades the energy resolution due to the differing response to electromagnetic and hadronic energy . in  compensating \" calorimeters , design parameters are tuned to minimize this response difference and thereby optimize hadronic energy resolution @xcite .",
    "techniques for calibrating calorimeters include injecting light using lasers as well as studying the response to high - energy muons .",
    "since muons do not shower , they deposit only minimum - ionizing pulse height in the active layers .",
    "the need to measure with precision both muons and showers leads to stringent demands for analog - to - digital - converter linearity and dynamic range  @xcite ; 14 bits is not uncommon .",
    "these include the inorganic scintillators discussed above as well as lead - glass arrays and liquid - argon and liquid - xenon ionization chambers .",
    "lead glass is not a scintillator , but electrons and positrons from an electromagnetic shower occurring within it emit visible cherenkov light which can be detected using pmts . since they are not subject to sampling fluctuations , homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters generally have better energy resolution than sampling calorimeters , for example the 2.7%/@xmath75 ( fwhm ) that was achieved by the crystal ball collaboration using thallium - doped sodium iodide @xcite and the 5%/@xmath76 achieved by the opal collaboration using lead glass  @xcite .",
    "particle spectrometers are characterized by great variety in their purposes and layouts .",
    "generically they may be divided into fixed - target spectrometers , in which a beam is aimed at a target that is stationary ( or in the case of a gas - jet target , moving slowly ) in the laboratory , and colliding - beam spectrometers , in which two particle beams moving in opposite directions are brought into collision .",
    "we consider next two typical examples to illustrate the use of the detectors and techniques described above .      as a simple example of a fixed - target spectrometer we consider that of the fermilab hypercp experiment ( fig .",

    "the difference in properties between matter and antimatter has been observed through the behavior of only one particle type to date .",

    "since its width is finite , it in fact accepts particles over some range of track curvature and momentum .",

    "the role of the calorimeter is to suppress triggers that could occur when ambient muons or other low - energy particles count in the hodoscopes .",
    "large numbers of such background particles are produced by particle interactions in the shielding , but their contribution to the trigger rate is effectively suppressed by the calorimeter trigger requirement .",
    "the 100 khz rate of event triggers is dominated by interactions of beam particles in the material of the spectrometer that give counts in both hodoscopes .",

    "given the information from the mwpc telescope , three - dimensional reconstruction of the momentum vector of each charged particle can be carried out on a computer . since momentum is conserved , the vector sum of the momenta of the @xmath82 decay products must equal the momentum vector @xmath93 of the @xmath82 itself , and likewise , since energy is conserved , the sum of the energies of the decay products must equal the energy @xmath94 of the @xmath82 . from the relativistic relationship among mass , energy , and momentum ,",

    "the @xmath84 trajectory is then extrapolated upstream to its point of closest approach with the pion track from the @xmath82 decay , which represents the position at which the @xmath82 decayed .",
    "we observe an ( approximately ) exponential distribution as expected for the decay of an unstable particle .",
    "this reflects quantum - mechanical randomness : although the @xmath82 has a definite _ average _ lifetime ( as given in table [ tab : particles ] ) , the actual time interval from creation to decay of a given individual @xmath82 can not be predicted but varies randomly from event to event .",
    "the deviations from exponential character arise from three sources : ( 1 ) some background events are present in the sample , ( 2 ) we have not corrected for the ( momentum - dependent ) relativistic time - dilation factor @xmath99 , which is different for each event , and ( 3 ) the detection probability is not entirely uniform for @xmath82 hyperons decaying at different points within the vacuum decay region .",
    "these effects can all be corrected in a more sophisticated analysis , but the simple analysis presented here serves to illustrate the key points .    4 in      to indicate the wide range of possible spectrometer configurations , we next consider briefly the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) spectrometer .",
    "this is an example of a colliding - beam spectrometer notable for its use ( along with the d0 spectrometer ) in the 1995 discovery of the top quark .",
    "a key difference between fixed - target and colliding - beam spectrometers is that in the former case the reaction products emerge within a narrow cone around the beam direction , whereas two beams colliding head - on produce reaction products that emerge in all directions .",

    "a typical design goal of colliding - beam spectrometers is  hermeticity , \" i.e.  as few as possible of the particles produced in the collisions should escape undetected .",
    "this of course contradicts the requirements that the detectors be supported in place and that the signals be brought out , thus compromises are necessary .",
    "the cdf detector has been described in the literature  @xcite ; space constraints preclude a detailed discussion here .",
    "[ fig : cdf_schematic ] shows schematically one - quarter of the spectrometer , which surrounds the point ( actually a region about 0.5 m long ) inside the tevatron beam pipe at which the proton and antiproton beams collide .",
    "[ fig : cdf_photo ] shows the actual layout .",
    "[ fig : zmumu ] is an  event display , \" i.e.  a schematic diagram showing the particle tracks as reconstructed by the spectrometer ; the event shown contains a high - momentum muon ( @xmath100 ) and antimuon ( @xmath101 ) resulting from the production and decay of a @xmath102 gauge boson . in the figure the beam axis runs into and out of the page , as does the magnetic field due to the superconducting solenoidal momentum - analyzing electromagnet .",
    "the curvature of charged - particle tracks due to the magnetic field is clearly evident .",
    "a positive identification of a muon can be made for those trajectories that pass through the massive hadronic calorimeter relatively unscathed and leave signals in surrounding scintillators and wire chambers .",

    "[ fig : z ] shows the distribution in muon - pair mass observed by cdf .",
    "the prominent peak at 91 gev/@xmath103 is due to the @xmath102 .",
    "its width reflects both the ( classical ) measurement resolution of the magnetic spectrometer and the ( quantum - mechanical ) uncertainty on the @xmath102 s mass ( intrinsic width @xmath104 gev/@xmath103 fwhm ) due to its short lifetime .",
    "since @xmath105 represents the @xmath102 s energy uncertainty , and the lifetime @xmath106 its duration uncertainty , they satisfy a version of the heisenberg uncertainty relation : @xmath107 .    4 in",
    "following an introduction to particle physics and particle detectors , we have considered two contrasting examples of subatomic - particle spectrometers , ranging from the relatively simple ( hypercp ) to the complex ( cdf ) . while the brief discussion just given illustrates the variety of issues encountered in designing particle spectrometers and their electronic instrumentation , the actual design process is quite involved .",
    "extensive computer simulation is generally employed to tailor a solution optimized for the problem at hand .",
    "requirements for performance and reliability often come up against practical constraints on cost and on development and assembly time .",
    "the ongoing development of new technology for particle detectors and their instrumentation , together with the development of increasingly intense particle beams , make measurements possible that were previously not feasible . when new detector technology is employed , simulation studies must be combined with prototype tests both on the bench and at test beams .",
    "the investigation of matter and energy at ever deeper and more sophisticated levels exemplifies fruitful collaboration among scientists and engineers .",
