    "we define the quantities [ deltadef0 ] m^2_ijm_i^2-m_j^2  , _ ij  , _",
    "the latter plays an important rle in the rg evolution of @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    "we set cp - violating phases to zero throughout the paper , so @xmath5 can be parametrized by three succesive rotations as [ vdef ] v = r_23(_1)r_31(_2)r_12(_3)=  , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the experimental information on the neutrino sector is the following . for the chooz angle : @xmath11 ; for the atmospheric neutrino parameters : @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; and for the solar ones ( with the msw mechanism @xcite at work ) : @xmath14 or @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the nearly bi - maximal structure of the neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath5 , is very different from that of the quark sector , where all the mixings are small .",
    "an attractive possibility to explain this is that some neutrino mixings are radiatively enhanced , i.e. are initially small and get large in the renormalization group ( rg ) running from high to low energy ( rg effects on neutrino parameters have been discussed in @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this amplification effect has been considered at large in the literature @xcite , @xcite@xcite , but quite often the analyses were incomplete or even incorrect .    in this paper",
    "we carefully examine this mechanism for radiative amplification of mixing angles , paying particular attention to _ 1 ) _ a complete treatment of all neutrino parameters ( to ensure that not only mixing angles but also mass splittings agree with experiment at low energy ) and _ 2 ) _ the fine - tuning price of amplification .",
    "we perform this analysis in conventional scenarios , like the standard model ( sm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and confront them with unconventional supersymmetric scenarios , proposed recently , in which neutrino masses originate in the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the sources of neutrino masses in both types of scenarios and their renormalization group equations ( rges ) are reviewed in section  2 , which also includes a generic discussion of the presence of infrared pseudo - fixed points ( irfp ) in the running of the mixing angles .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the radiative amplification of mixing angles in the conventional scenarios ( sm and mssm ) : we start with an illustrative toy model of only two flavours and later we apply the mechanism first to the amplification of the solar angle , then to the atmospheric angle and finally to the simultaneous amplification of both . section  4 deals with the amplification of the mixing angles in the unconventional supersymmetric model which looks quite promising due to its peculiar rg features .",
    "we collect some conclusions in section  5 .",

    "[ kappaa ] as explained in @xcite , the rge for @xmath86 has the remarkable property of being dependent of @xmath86 itself only through the universal piece .",

    "non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet models also have vertex corrections , but there is no such cancellation there .",
    "some interesting implications that follow from the rges ( [ kappas ] , [ kappaa ] ) were presented in @xcite .",

    "however , when @xmath4 has ( quasi-)degenerate eigenvalues ( @xmath89 ) , even small perturbations can cause large effects in the eigenvectors ( _ i.e. _ in the form of @xmath5 ) .",
    "this can be easily understood : for exact degeneracy there is an ambiguity in the choice of the associated eigenvectors , and thus in the definition of @xmath5 . when the perturbation due to rg running is added , the degeneracy is lifted and a particular form of @xmath5 is singled out . if the initial degeneracy is not exact , the change of @xmath5 will be large or not depending on the size of the perturbation ( @xmath90 ) compared with the initial mass splitting at the scale @xmath35 , @xmath91 .",
    "when the rg effect dominates , @xmath5 evolves quickly from its initial value @xmath92 to a stable form ( an infrared pseudo - fixed point , irfp ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a rotation in the plane of the two quasi - degenerate states @xmath95 such that the perturbation of @xmath4 is diagonal in the rotated basis ( as is familiar from degenerate perturbation theory ) .",
    "scenarios in which this takes place are attractive for two main reasons : _ 1 ) _ some particular mixing angle will be selected as a result of @xmath5 approaching its irfp form and _ 2 ) _ the @xmath96-@xmath97 mass - splitting will be essentially determined at low energy by rg effects .",
    "when @xmath98 , rg effects can produce substantial changes in @xmath5 without getting too close to the irfp .",

    "as explained above , when two neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate ( and with the same sign ) radiative corrections can have a large effect on neutrino mixing angles .",
    "this offers an interesting opportunity for generating large mixing angles at low energy as an effect of rg evolution , starting with a mixing angle that might be small .",
    "this possibility has received a great deal of attention in the literature @xcite , @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we explain why the implementation of this idea in the sm or the mssm is not as appealing as usually believed . in order to show this we will make much use of the rges for physical parameters derived in ref .",

    "we have first studied the two - flavour scenario , where all these features show up in a transparent way .",
    "then , we have explored the physical cases exhaustively .",
    "our main results and conclusions are the following .",
    "* in the sm it is not possible to amplify either the solar or the atmospheric mixings , even with fine - tunings",
    ". simply , the radiative effects that modify the mixings ( which are proportional to the tau yukawa coupling squared , @xmath87 ) are not large enough to do the job for the currently preferred range of masses ( @xmath299 ev ) .",
    "for the same reason , the mass splittings can not have a radiative origin .",
    "* for the mssm the amplification is possible but only when ( at least two ) neutrinos are quasi - degenerate ( in absolute value and sign ) , and always involves a fine - tuning between the initial mass splitting ( solar or atmospheric ) and its radiative correction : two physically unrelated quantities that are required to be close to each other .",
    "the magnitude of this fine - tuning is essentially the amplification factor achieved .",
    "moreover , a precise value of @xmath50 ( very high for the atmospheric case ) is required .",
    "the amplification of the atmospheric angle requires an additional and even more important fine - tuning , since the solar splitting gets a radiative correction of `` atmospheric '' size which should be compensated by an ad - hoc initial condition . finally , simultaneous amplification of solar and atmospheric angles is possible but it is extremely fine - tuned .",
    "+ all these problems come from the fact that in the sm and the mssm the mixing matrix ( when there is some initial quasi - degeneracy ) approaches an infrared pseudo - fixed - point ( irfp ) which implies a physically unacceptable mixing ( solar or atmospheric ) .",
    "therefore , parameters should be delicately chosen for the running to stop before reaching the irfp .",
    "* things are much better for the scenario of neutrino masses arising from the khler potential .",
    "first of all , the infrared fixed points correspond here to maximal or quasi - maximal mixings , so there is no need of fine - tuning in order to amplify angles .",
    "this can work for both the solar and the atmospheric angles .",
    "+ moreover , the amplification mechanism can work even if the mass eigenvalues are not quasi - degenerate .",
    "the reason is that the strength of the rg effect is proportional to @xmath300 , where @xmath301 is the scale of a coupling that arises from the khler potential and @xmath6 are the mass eigenvalues [ in conventional cases the strength of the effect is proportional to @xmath302 .",
    "so it is enough to have @xmath303 to get important radiative effects , thus reaching the irfp . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of @xmath301 introduces an additional uncertainty , which is however removed taking into account that here the low - energy splitting , @xmath304 , is essentially a pure radiative effect , whose magnitude can be adjusted with the value of @xmath301 without modifying the form of the irfp .",
    "+ we find very encouraging that the scenario of neutrino masses from the khler potential , which is attractive for different reasons ( e.g. it implies that the scale of lepton number violation is much closer to the electroweak scale than in conventional scenarios ) has this remarkable and nice behaviour regarding radiative corrections .    to conclude , two more comments are in order .",
    "first , radiative effects play a relevant role in neutrino physics that often can not be ignored .",
    "e.g. in view of the scarce success of radiative amplification in the mssm , one might think that radiative effects are not relevant for model building in that framework .",
    "however , especially for scenarios involving some quasi - degeneracy , radiative effects can have the ( negative ) effect of destabilizing the high - energy pattern of mixing angles and mass splittings .",
    "the formulae presented in this paper are useful to analyze these effects .",
    "second , the radiative corrections studied in this paper are model - independent since they concern the running from the @xmath35-scale ( the scale where the new physics that violates l appears ) down to the electroweak scale and this running is determined by the effective theory valid in that range ( the sm or the mssm with a non - renormalizable operator responsible for neutrino masses ) .",
    "besides these corrections there are others arising from physics beyond @xmath35 , or corrections from the running between a fundamental scale , say @xmath305 or @xmath306 , and @xmath35 . in the see - saw model",
    "this corresponds to the running of the neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath307 , and the right - handed neutrino masses between @xmath305 and @xmath35 .",
    "these effects can be quite important ( for the see - saw they depends on the magnitude of @xmath307 and have been analyzed elsewhere @xcite ) . ] but they are much more model - dependent .",
    "their role is to set the initial conditions at @xmath35 for the model - independent radiative effects analyzed here .",
    "the energy - scale evolution of a @xmath3 neutrino ( majorana ) mass matrix @xmath4 is generically described by a rge of the form ( @xmath43 ) : = -(u m_+ p m_+ m_p^t )  , [ rgmap ] in ( [ rgmap ] ) , @xmath308 is a number , so @xmath309 gives a family - universal scaling of @xmath4 which does not affect its texture , while @xmath310 is a matrix in flavour space thus producing a non family - universal correction ( the most interesting effect ) .",
