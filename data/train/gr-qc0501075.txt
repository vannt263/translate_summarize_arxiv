    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a candidate theory for quantum gravity ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "it achieves a canonical quantization of general relativity : it describes the quantum states of space geometry and their evolution in `` time '' .",
    "the states are the so - called spin network states , which can be roughly understood as quantized discretized manifold .",
    "the theory derives a discrete spectrum for geometrical operators ( such as the areas and volumes ) and therefore implements the notion of quanta of space(time ) .",
    "there three main issues which need to be addressed in loop quantum gravity .",
    "a first one is the problem of the _ semi - classical limit _ : we would like to recover general relativity ( and quantum field theory ) as low energy theories .",
    "more precisely , the theme is to truly understand the geometry of a spin network background , to understand how the quantum geometry of spin networks will describe a smooth spacetime manifold at some coarse - grained level",
    ". we must identify diffeomorphisms acting on the discrete quantum geometry defined by a spin network background ( maps from itself to itself ) . we must develop the notion of spacetime points in this quantum context and how to localize objects and systems in such a quantum spacetime .",
    "a second issue is to solve the dynamics of the theory .",
    "we are supposed to implement and solve the hamiltonian constraint in order to identify the physical states of the theory .",
    "then we should somehow recover a notion of time and evolution through some gauge fixing .",
    "the third issue is to find physically relevant observables . in this diffeomorphism invariant context",
    ", a natural choice is the relational observables , which can be understood as the physical correlations between two systems .",
    "if one of these systems can be identified with a reference frame ( when its state space approximates a classical symmetry group ) , then one has constructed an observable describing the position of the other system with respect to that reference system . in our quantum geometry",
    "set - up , we are particularly interested in @xmath0 reference frame , which would allow to define a direction in space , and @xmath1 reference frame , which would define a ( quantum ) clock .    a possibly relevant point of view is provided by quantum information .",
    "it appears that many mathematical tools and physical questions are actually shared by loop quantum gravity and the quantum information field , and it could be helpful to develop an explicit bridge between these two research areas .",
    "this defines a project to reformulate quantum geometry in terms of entropy , entanglement and quantum reference frames . the present work is thought as part of this bigger project .",
    "we seek to understand the geometry of spin networks at the kinematical level .",
    "we reformulate spin networks in terms of harmonic oscillators and we show how the boundary degrees of freedom in lqg are described as matrix models .",
    "more precisely , we show that the space of @xmath2 intertwiners with @xmath3 legs carries a @xmath4 structure .",
    "this allows a fresh look on the semi - classicality issue from the point of view of non - commutative geometry .",
    "we also describe how spin network can be understood as quantum circuits , i.e. that the quantum gravity kinematical states can be interpreted as dynamical processes .",
    "this particular idea of spin networks arising as a natural tool in describing quantum computations was already pushed forward by marzuoli and rasetti @xcite . in a last section ,",
    "we explain how quantum reference frames should allow us to localize systems on a spin network background and end with the idea that a notion of distance could be constructed on a spin network can be constructed in terms of entanglement between parts of that spin network .",
    "loop quantum gravity describes the quantum states of 3d geometry as _ spin networks _ , which roughly describe one - dimensional quantized excitations of the gravitational field .",
    "spin networks are graph whose edges are dressed up with @xmath2 representations and whose vertices are @xmath2 invariant tensors intertwining between the representations associated to the edges linked to a particular vertex .",
    "more precisely , we use the irreducible finite - dimensional representations of @xmath2 , which are labeled by a half - integer usually called _ spin _ and noted as @xmath5 .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of a spin network is as a discretized 3d manifold .",
    "indeed the area of a surface and the volume of a space region become operators , which turn out to be diagonal in the spin network basis : the spin @xmath5 s label the area eigenvectors while the intertwiners define the volume eigenvalues . this way , the vertices of a spin network represent chunks of volume , and the edge representing the link between two chunks of volume is dual to the surface separating the two regions .",
    "the area of an elementary surface intersecting the underlying spin network at only an edge , which is labeled by a spin @xmath5 , can be derived from the quantization of the area operator and is defined up to regularization issues .",
    "noting @xmath6 the planck length , the area of a spin @xmath5 is usually assumed to the square root of the casimir operator , @xmath7 , but other reasonable candidates are the simpler choice @xmath8 or the shifted choice @xmath9 .",
    "let us now describe the state of a surface in the lqg framework .",
    "a generic surface is considered as made of a certain ( finite ) number of elementary patches or surfaces .",
    "an elementary surface is defined as one corresponding to a single intersection with a spin network .",
    "it is thus described by a @xmath2 irreducible representation labeled by a spin @xmath5 .",
    "the spin @xmath5 gives the area of the elementary surface while a generic vector @xmath10 of the representation hilbert space @xmath11 can be understood as the quantized version of the ( bi)vector normal to the surface .",
    "we propose to use a different basis for the hilbert space corresponding to an elementary surface exploiting the presentation of @xmath2 as a system of two harmonic oscillators .",
    "instead of ( quantum ) vectors labeled by their `` norm '' @xmath5 and their `` direction '' @xmath12 , we will have states labeled by the energy level of the two harmonic oscillators .",
    "we hope that such a change of point of view would lead to some further insight in the dynamics of spin networks in lqg since harmonic oscillator systems are better understood than any other systems in theoretical physics .",
    "explicitly , let us start with two harmonic oscillators : @xmath13=[b , b\\dag]=1 , \\qquad [ a , b]=0.\\ ] ] then we define the following operators : j_z=(aa - bb ) , j_+=ab , j_-=j_+=ab , e=(aa+bb ) .",
    "the operators @xmath14 s define a @xmath15 algebra while the total energy @xmath16 commutes with the @xmath14 s and is thus a casimir operator for @xmath15 : = 0 , = j _ , = 2j_z .",
    "the spin representations at fixed @xmath5 s are given by fixing the total energy @xmath16 .",
    "then diagonalising the two operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we obtain the simple correspondence between the @xmath2 usual basis @xmath10 and the basis defined by the energy levels @xmath18 of the two oscillators : j=(n_a+n_b),m=(n_a - n_b ) , e|j m = j|j m , j_z|j m = m|j m. let us remark that the usual quadratic casimir operator of the @xmath15 algebra is given by : ^2= j_z^2+(j_+j_-+j_-j_+)=e(e+1 ) . here , in a sense , considering the harmonic oscillators allows us to take the square root of the quadratic casimir .",
    "we have introduced these harmonic oscillators as a mathematical tool .",
    "physically , one is tempted to interpret the oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 are left and right modes moving along the edge of the spin network puncturing the elementary surface .",
    "the total energy @xmath16 then defines the area of the surface , while the difference of energies defines the orientation and direction of the surface . from this point of view",
    ", the elementary surface can be considered as an elementary ( chiral ) screen with information flowing through it from left to right and right to left , in such a way that the information flow itself defines the geometry ( state ) of the surface .",
    "this might help implementing the ideas on the holographic principle for loop quantum gravity presented in @xcite .",
    "let us point out that we are here using the area spectrum @xmath21 , defined by the energy operator @xmath16 , instead of the standard @xmath22 usually used in lqg .",
    "by considering , the @xmath23 additional term in the energy of the harmonic oscillator ( defining the energy by @xmath24 ) , then we would obtain the @xmath25 area spectrum .",
    "due to regularization ambiguities in loop quantum gravity , there is no mathematical reason to select a particular area spectrum over another , and the present harmonic oscillator presentation favors the use of the simpler spectrum @xmath21 .",
    "after having described surface states , we will study in the next section the structures associated to volumes in quantum geometry , i.e. @xmath15 intertwiners , and we will show how the harmonic oscillator presentation of @xmath15 allow for a simple description of the volume states .",
    "let us consider a single vertex ( of a spin network ) with @xmath3 edges linked to it .",
    "labeling the edges with @xmath15 spins @xmath27 , the vertex is described by an intertwiner between the @xmath3 representations , i.e. an @xmath2-invariant tensor @xmath28 .",
    "the intertwiner defines the ( quantum ) volume corresponding to the vertex .",
    "indeed it contains information on how the elementary surfaces , dual to the edges , are combined together to form a surface boundary of the space region dual to the vertex .",
    "mathematically , @xmath29 gives the area of the @xmath30th elementary surface and corresponds to the @xmath2 casimir operator @xmath31 of the representation @xmath32 while the intertwiner contains information on how these representations are intertwined and provides the values of the mixed casimir operators @xmath33 ( which defines the angle between the elementary surfaces @xmath30 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "now , from the point of view of the boundary surface , we are considering a 2-sphere with a single vertex inside from which @xmath3 links are leaving and puncturing the sphere at @xmath3 points which represent the @xmath3 elementary surfaces the surface is made of .    here , we are interested by characterizing the algebra of @xmath2-invariant observables associated to a vertex with @xmath3 edges , or equivalently a surface made of @xmath3 elementary patches , at fixed total area . more precisely , we now allow the spins @xmath27 to vary while we keep the total area @xmath34 fixed , and we look for the algebra of operators commuting with a global @xmath2 gauge transformation ( on all elementary surfaces ) and with the operator defining the total area . in this picture , not only the intertwiner is fuzzy and undetermined but also the surface itself is fuzzily defined , so that all the geometric quantities are treated on the same footing .     in terms of two harmonic oscillators ,",
    "we replace all lines of the spin network by double lines symbolizing the harmonic oscillators @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "then , considering an intertwiner with @xmath3 legs , which can be interpreted as dual to a @xmath35 surface punctured by @xmath3 spin networks edges , we look for @xmath2 invariant states in the tensor product of the @xmath36 harmonic oscillators.,width=302 ]    having @xmath3 elementary surfaces , we start with @xmath3 copies of the @xmath15 algebra @xmath37 and equivalently with @xmath3 pairs of harmonic oscillators @xmath38 . the total area of the surface is defined as the sum of the area of all the elementary patches , and therefore as the total energy of the @xmath39 harmonic oscillators : e_i=1^n e_i=_i(a_i^a_i+b_i^b_i ) . global @xmath2 gauge transformations on the full surface is defined as the simultaneous action of all the local @xmath2 s : j_z=_i^n j_z^(i ) , j_=_i^n j_^(i ) .",
    "we now seek to identify the algebra of operators invariant under global @xmath2 rotations and leaving the total area / energy @xmath16 invariant .",
    "considering the action of the operators @xmath40 , it is straightforward to see that this invariant algebra is generated by the local area operators acting each puncture : @xmath41 and by cross operators acting ( non - locally ) on each pair of punctures : @xmath42 @xmath43 this way , we obtain @xmath44 operators .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the @xmath45 are all hermitian operators and form a @xmath46 lie algebra .",
    "then , quotienting by the trivially invariant operator @xmath47 , we get that the invariant algebra is @xmath48 .    more explicitly , introducing the operators @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ", we have the following commutation relations : = 2(e_j - e_i ) , = + g_ij , = -g_ij , = g_kj [ commutator ]    now , it is rather natural to obtain @xmath51 as the group of operators leaving the area invariant , and it can be thought as the action of the _ diffeomorphisms _ moving @xmath3 punctures on the surface of a 2-sphere . when increasing the number of punctures , we refine the structure of the surface , building it out of more and more points or patches , and we refine these discrete diffeomorphisms defined by @xmath51 towards the continuum limit .",
    "there are actually many works explaining how @xmath52 can be thought as the diffeomorphism group of a 2-sphere ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , one could object that spin networks describe ( 3d ) diffeomorphism invariant states of geometry , so how can we talk of diffeomorphisms acting non - trivially on a spin network .",
    "in fact , we are dealing with diffeomorphisms moving the stuff ( degrees of freedom ) living on the spin networks .",
    "just as diffeomorphisms on a manifold ( which is abstractly a diffeomorphism invariant object ) is a map from the manifold to itself moving the manifold points around , one can introduce a similar notion of diffeomorphisms living on a spin network moving around the degrees of freedom living on the edges and vertices of the spin networks .",
    "one should compare the @xmath51 structure , that we derive here by allowing the punctures to take any spin value , with the standard case when all the punctures have a fixed spin , usually all at spin 1/2 . in that case",
    ", it is possible to decompose the tensor product @xmath53 into the direct sum of tensor products of a @xmath2 representation with spin running from 0 to @xmath54 and a representation of the permutation group of @xmath3 objects .",
    "formally , it reads : ( v^1/2)^n=_k=0^n/2 ( v^k r^(k)(s_n ) ) , where @xmath55 is an irreducible representation of the permutation group @xmath56 .",
    "this is usually referred as schur duality ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "that tensor product decomposition shows that the intertwiner space between @xmath3 punctures of fixed spin @xmath23 provides an irreducible representation of @xmath56 . in our generalized analysis , by allowing the punctures to have any possible spin , we extend the discrete group @xmath56 to the lie group @xmath51 .      while the operators @xmath57 probe the area of a single puncture , the mixed operators @xmath58 probe the structure of the intertwiner between the punctures . indeed considering two punctures @xmath59 ,",
    "the intertwiner between the two representations is defined through the values of the casimir operators @xmath33 which can be expressed in terms of the @xmath16 and @xmath60 operators : j_(i).j_(j ) = g_ijg_ij - e_ie_j - e_i = g_ijg_ij-(e_i+)(e_j+)+(e_j - e_i)+ .",
    "therefore , the operators @xmath61 contain the same information as the @xmath33 operators and allow to describe all the @xmath2 gauge invariant operators and the full intertwiner space .",
    "moreover , this formula allows us to extract the explicit spectrum of the positive operator @xmath62 . considering that @xmath63 and having fixed the representations corresponding the punctures @xmath30 and @xmath5 to @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 , it is well - known that the allowed values of @xmath67 are @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "in this basis @xmath70 , the operator @xmath62 is diagonal and its values are : @xmath71 therefore assuming @xmath72 and introducing the positive level @xmath73 which maximal value is @xmath74 , the eigenvalues of @xmath62 are @xmath75 .",
    "the first term @xmath76 can be identified as a harmonic oscillator contribution with @xmath77 the number of quanta since ( [ commutator ] ) gives the commutator @xmath78=2(b - a)$ ] as soon as we diagonalize the operators @xmath79 .",
    "the extra - term @xmath80 can then be interpreted as coming from the @xmath2 structure . in the end , we can write the spectrum of @xmath62 as depending on two numbers , the energy level ( of the mixing of the two punctures ) @xmath81 and the energy difference ( of the two punctures ) @xmath82 : ( n , k)=n(n+k+1 ) .",
    "let us now discuss the structure of the intertwiner space as seen from the @xmath51 point of view .",
    "first let us recall that an intertwiner is a @xmath2 invariant tensor between representations of @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , choosing the spin representations @xmath27 living at the @xmath3 punctures , an intertwiner is a map @xmath83 which is invariant under global @xmath2 rotations .",
    "let us call @xmath84 the hilbert space of such intertwiners . actually ,",
    "in our framework , we consider arbitrary spins at each puncture . thus noting @xmath85 the ( reducible ) @xmath2 representation containing all possible spins , we have been looking at intertwiners @xmath86 .",
    "let us call @xmath87 the ( hilbert ) space of such intertwiners .",
    "as the operators @xmath88 and @xmath33 are invariant under global @xmath2 rotations , they define operators on @xmath87 .",
    "moreover as the operators @xmath88 commute with each other , they can be be simultaneously diagonalized , which means that : @xmath89 the interesting structure of the intertwiner space comes from the fact that the cross operators @xmath33 do not commute and can not be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "moreover , we have constructed above the @xmath2 invariant operators @xmath90 , which are thus operators on @xmath87 , who generate all @xmath2 invariant operators i.e all operators acting on @xmath87 . as these operators form a @xmath4 algebra , the hilbert space of intertwiners @xmath87 carries a @xmath51 representation .",
    "more precisely , picking a given representation of @xmath51 , a vector in the representation space specifies an intertwiner . in more details , the operators @xmath57 form the cartan subalgebra of @xmath4 while the cross operators @xmath91 are the roots of the lie algebra .",
    "the irreducible ( unitary ) representations of @xmath4 are highest weight representations .",
    "the weights give the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath57 , which we note @xmath92 .",
    "so a representation is defined by the maximal values of the @xmath93 s @xmath94 and a basis or the representation space can be roughly labeled as @xmath95 . now interpreting such a vector as an intertwiner , we point out that the weights @xmath96 are actually the spin labeling the @xmath2 representations : @xmath97 .",
    "so @xmath98 defines an intertwiner in @xmath99 .",
    "then on such a intertwiner state , one can compute the expectation values and correlations of the @xmath91 operators and thus of the invariant operators @xmath33 .",
    "this will be investigated in details in @xcite at least in the case @xmath100 ( first non - trivial case ) .",
    "an important issue in ( loop ) quantum gravity is to build semi - classical states of geometry .",
    "here we develop a notion of coherent intertwiners , which we hope to be useful in the study of semi - classicality .",
    "we define coherent intertwiner states as minimizing the uncertainty relations on the invariant operators @xmath33 .",
    "more explicitly , while the @xmath101 s define the area associated to each puncture ( or more precisely dual to each puncture ) , the @xmath33 s can be interpreted as describing the area attached to internal surfaces .",
    "the issue is that these internal area operators do not commute .",
    "indeed it is easy to check that : = i_abcj_(i)^aj_(j)^bj_(k)^c0 .",
    "[ vol ] this commutator can actually be considered as defining a volume punctures , the 4-valent intertwine is dual to a tetrahedron .",
    "the operator @xmath102 defines the square volume operator for this quantum tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath103 = \\f{i}{4}\\left ( g_{ki}g_{jk}g_{ij}-g_{ji}g_{kj}g_{ik } \\right ) = \\f{i}{4}\\left ( g_{ij}g_{jk}g_{ki}-g_{ik}g_{kj}g_{ji } \\right),\\ ] ] in our formalism .",
    "more details on the properties of this operator will be explained in @xcite . ] .",
    "however , the point we would like to insist upon here is that the lie algebra generated by the commutators of the @xmath33 s does nt close and generates operators of higher and higher order in the initial @xmath14 s . now if one would like to write coherent intertwiner states , or semi - classical states , one would need in principle to minimize the uncertainties relations corresponding to each of these commutation relations , i.e. a infinite tower of uncertainty relations . on the other hand ,",
    "our formalism gives us access to the operators @xmath61 from which we can reconstruct all the @xmath2 invariant operators in the @xmath14 s .",
    "these operators @xmath61 form a closed lie algebra identified as @xmath4 and we do not need to investigate the detailed structure of the tower of commutators of the @xmath14 operators .",
    "one can then use all the already developed formalism of coherent states on lie groups @xcite .",
    "roughly , coherent states are given up to a unitary transformation by the highest weight states of the irreducible ( unitary ) representations of @xmath4 with @xmath104 .",
    "the details of the analysis of these coherent states will be carried elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one further advantage to study directly the @xmath4 states is that we are dealing at once with all possible values of the puncture areas , instead of the standard naive approach of minimizing the uncertainty relation ( [ vol ] ) case by case for each set of values of the boundary areas @xmath101 .",
    "another very interesting approach to quantum gravity , besides loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is non - commutative geometry ( ncg ) , either as a framework describing an effective quantum gravity theory ( deformed special relativity , non - commutative field theories , ... ) or defining quantum spacetime as a full non - commutative spacetime ( connes approach ) .",
    "there is hardly an explicit link between lqg and ncg ( except in 3d gravity ) .",
    "identifying a relationship between the two would be of crucial importance as it would provide more tools to study issues of loop quantum gravity like the semi - classical limit and the emergence of the space - time continuum among other things .",
    "we want here to take advantage of the identification of the intertwiner space with the fuzzy sphere to show such a link .",
    "fuzzy sphere_@xcite is one of the best known example of ncg .",
    "the main idea of ncg is to describe geometry in terms of algebraic tools . indeed a topological space @xmath105 is completely described by the commutative algebra @xmath106 of continuous functions over it .",
    "if @xmath105 is further provided with a differential structure , to make it a manifold , @xmath105 gets encoded at the algebraic level as the algebra @xmath107 provided with a differential operator .",
    "more precisely connes @xcite showed that there is a complete equivalence between a spinorial compact manifold and a spectral triple @xmath108 , which contains the algebra , the dirac operator encoding the differential structure and the metric , and finally the chirality operator .",
    "there is a list of axioms which constraint the possible choices of spectral triples , but we will not deal here with the details of the spectral triple structures .",
    "nevertheless we will still call the differential operator as the dirac operator .",
    "there is a complete dictionary relating geometrical objects to algebraic ones .",
    "for example the diffeomorphisms of @xmath105 are encoded at the algebraic level by the automorphisms of @xmath107 .",
    "this construction is very fruitful as it allows in particular to unify gravity with any yang - mills - higgs theory as a gravity theory on an almost - commutative space@xcite .",
    "let us remind the mathematics of the fuzzy sphere .",
    "one considers the algebra of continuous functions of the sphere @xmath109 .",
    "these functions @xmath110 are generated by the polynomials @xmath111 , together with the condition @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath113 are the 3d euclidian coordinates and are naturally commutative .",
    "the fuzzy sphere is obtained by truncating the algebra in the degree of the polynomials . at the 0th order ,",
    "the algebra is just @xmath114 . at first order ,",
    "the vector space of linear polynomials is isomorphic to @xmath115 . as an algebra , one",
    "describe it as the matrix algebra @xmath116 .",
    "this algebra is non - commutative and induces a non - commutative product on the space of polynomials .",
    "the interested reader can find details on the @xmath117-product of the fuzzy sphere in @xcite .",
    "one follows the same procedure at all orders : the fuzzy sphere @xmath118 is therefore described as the matrix algebra @xmath119 .",
    "the coordinates for the fuzzy sphere are define as operators and are given by the generators of @xmath15 , in the representation of spin @xmath120 ( of dimension @xmath121 ) : [ coord ] x_i = j_i^(n/2 ) .",
    "they are non - commutative : @xmath122=i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}}\\epsilon_{ij}{}^k\\,x_k.\\ ] ] this commutator vanishes in the limit @xmath123 and one recovers the usual classical sphere @xmath35 .",
    "the `` diffeomorphisms '' of @xmath118 are given by the group of automorphisms of @xmath119 , which is @xmath51 .",
    "now , it is easy to make the link between the intertwiner space and the fuzzy sphere .",
    "indeed , the space @xmath4 of @xmath2 gauge invariant operators is naturally represented on the hilbert space @xmath119 of the fuzzy sphere as the space of hermitian operators while @xmath119 is the algebra of all operators . ] .",
    "then the group @xmath51 generated by the intertwiner algebra is automatically identified with the diffeomorphisms of @xmath118 .",
    "the geometry and metric information of the fuzzy sphere is encoded in the dirac operator @xmath124 .",
    "this operator acts on the algebra as a derivation , through the adjoint action : @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "acting with @xmath124 therefore generates the 1-forms and allows to define the differential calculus on the fuzzy sphere .",
    "moreover the dirac operator allows to define a distance and therefore the metric @xcite . on the algebra @xmath119 , a generic dirac operator , or derivation operator ,",
    "is simply an hermitian operator and will be given as a linear combination of the @xmath4 generators , that is the intertwining operators @xmath57 and @xmath126 .",
    "that is the dirac operator defines a particular intertwiner .",
    "we can also see the dirac operator as defining a particular basis of the intertwiner space as the basis of the eigenvectors of the derivation map @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "the fuzzy dirac operator is defined in terms of an arbitrary vector @xmath128 and fuzzy coordinates : @xmath129 in the limit @xmath123 , we recover then the usual differential operator @xmath130 on the the classical sphere @xmath35 @xcite .    a natural question is what happens when we choose another dirac operator : would we be simply describing a deformation of the fuzzy sphere ?",
    "it is then important to point out that the matrix algebra @xmath119 is the algebra for any fuzzy surface .",
    "it is only when specifying the dirac operator ( or equivalently the coordinates ) that we specify the topology and geometry of the considered fuzzy surface and define the classical surface we will get in the classical limit @xmath123 .",
    "indeed instead of taking the fuzzy sphere coordinates ( [ coord ] ) , one could have taken the non - commutative torus coordinates @xmath131 defined as : u^n=1 , v^n=1 , uv = e^ivu .",
    "of course , the @xmath123 limit of this fuzzy torus leads back to the classical torus .",
    "more generally , it was conjectured by madore @xcite that all the other genera are also given in terms of a specific basis in @xmath119 .",
    "this means that before the choice of the dirac operator , one is dealing with an arbitrary fuzzy surface .",
    "the choice of the dirac specifies the topology that we recover in the limit @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath119 contains very few information by itself , and it is the dirac operator which contains the whole geometrical information .",
    "the eigenvectors of this dirac operator defines a preferred basis of the hilbert space of intertwiners .",
    "this provides us with the geometrical interpretation of intertwiners : specific intertwiners will correspond to specific fuzzy surfaces .",
    "these intertwiners will be the ones describing the corresponding classical surface in the limit of an infinite number of punctures @xmath3 .",
    "we see that non - commutative geometry provides us with a new point of view to study the ( semi-)classical limit of loop quantum gravity .",
    "defining classical surfaces as the limit of matrix algebras of increasing size , we are able to identify the exact geometrical meaning of intertwiners using the notion of dirac operator . more generally , the mathematics of these matrix algebra limits is well understood and described in terms of bratelli diagrams @xcite .",
    "this is a path to explore , which we leave for future investigation .",
    "our last comment is about _ decoherence - free subspaces _ ( dfs ) .",
    "these spaces encodes the degrees of freedom which are not compromised by some chosen interactions or decoherence effects .",
    "these are especially important in the context of quantum computing where they identify the qbits which are most protected from decoherence effects .",
    "following an idea by david poulin and fotini markopoulou , @xcite proposes to identify the classical degrees of freedom of a quantum black hole in the continuum limit in a particular dfs , which would carry a representation of the classical @xmath2 rotation symmetry group .",
    "our construction can be transcribed in that context .",
    "the space of intertwiners can be interpreted as the dfs of loop quantum gravity boundary degrees of freedom invariant under global @xmath2 gauge transformation on the boundary . in this dfs ,",
    "we have described the states which can be understood as the fuzzy sphere and thus carry an approximation of the classical symmetry group @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider the general set - up of a bounded region ( with the simple topology of a 2-ball ) of the three - dimensional space .",
    "at the quantum level , the interior of the region is described by a spin network state or more generally by a superposition of spin network states .",
    "let us assume that the graph of all considered spin networks intersect the boundary surface in @xmath3 punctures .",
    "then the interior geometry is described by some spin network with support on some graph ( possibly very complex ) as long as it only intersect the boundary surface in @xmath3 points .",
    "the interior can be described by a superposition of spin networks with support on different graphs as long as all these graphs puncture the boundary sphere only at @xmath3 points . more generally , we could ( or should ) consider that the boundary surface be described by a superposition of states with different number of punctures .",
    "however , we then face the issue of defining the surface itself . here",
    "we take the point of view that the surface is defined as the set of @xmath3 points .",
    "the only assumption is that it is then possible to do a splitting between what is the inside or outside this discrete surface made out of these @xmath3 points . again in general , one would expect that such a splitting holds only approximately and becomes clear only at a coarse - grained level .",
    "let us thus consider a @xmath3-punctured 2-sphere .",
    "the state of the interior can be arbitrarily complicated , but from the boundary point of view , we only care about the resulting intertwiner between the @xmath3 @xmath2 representations living at the punctures .",
    "the state of the interior can involve a superposition of spin networks with support on different graphs , and it would not change as far as the boundary state is concerned since only the resulting intertwiner matters and not the details of the graphs .",
    "this induced boundary state can be described with a single vertex inside the 2-ball and can thus be interpreted as a completely coarse - grained bulk state : while the bulk could be described with complicated graphs , we can coarse - grain all these graphs to a simple graph with a single vertex as long as the intertwiner between the @xmath3 punctures is left unchanged , and an observer looking at the boundary will not see the difference . having realized that the boundary state is simply a coarse - grained bulk state , we can propose a `` holographic principle '' stating that the dynamics of the boundary state can be described without referring to the full bulk state , since it is simply the dynamics of a single intertwiner in lqg . from this point of view",
    ", it does make sense to talk about the dynamics of the boundary state .",
    "punctured sphere @xmath35 , the lqg bulk degrees of freedom are described as all spin networks states with support on arbitrary graphs puncturing the surface @xmath3 times .",
    "then one can coarse - grain these states down to a single vertex : the state is then described by a single intertwiner and is interpreted as the boundary state.,width=302 ]    now , the operators @xmath61 define the gauge invariant degrees of freedom leaving on the surface once its area is fixed .",
    "since these operators form a @xmath4 algebra , we can describe the degrees of freedom of the boundary surface as a @xmath132 matrix and define the dynamics of the surface state through a _ matrix model_. this matrix @xmath133 is the configuration variable on which act all the operators .",
    "its diagonal entries correspond to classical values of the @xmath57 and its off - diagonal components to classical values of the @xmath91 .",
    "the matrix model would be defined through an action @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "requiring the theory to be diffeomorphism invariant means asking the action to be invariant under the @xmath51 action @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , the possible actions are generated by the traces of the matrix @xmath136 or equivalently by symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of @xmath133 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath133 can be interpreted as proper vibration modes of the boundary surface .",
    "finally , as the matrix represents the degrees of freedom of the boundary , one can interpret this @xmath137 gauged matrix model as the holographic theory for the bulk loop quantum gravity . indeed",
    ", any dynamics of the bulk spin network will simply induce a @xmath2 gauge invariant dynamics on the boundary and thus will be described by some @xmath51 transformations .",
    "this looks very similar to the set - up of string theory where one works with @xmath51 super yang - mills theories on the boundary as the holographic theory for supergravities .    more work is needed to propose a reasonable matrix model describing the lqg dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , this matrix model formalism is very similar to the physics of 2d quantum gravity or higher - dimensional spin foam models@xcite ( group field theory formulation ) and to the matrix model approach to string theory@xcite .",
    "this reformulation of lqg could therefore be a first explicit step towards making a bridge between the physics of lqg and the physics of m - theory ( following the hopes of @xcite ) , or towards writing a string theory on a spin network background .",
    "the most pressing issue in lqg is understanding the dynamics of the quantum states of ( 3d ) geometry .",
    "this can be interpreted as solving the hamiltonian constraint for general relativity ( at the quantum level ) and obtain the hilbert space of physical states .",
    "nevertheless , even then , the problem would not be solved .",
    "one should then understand the different physical choices of time , their corresponding gauge fixing and their corresponding hamiltonian dictating the time evolution of the physical states .",
    "the point that we would like to emphasize here is that these physical states are supposed to be spin network states ( or precisely a superposition or distribution over spin networks ) .",
    "however , these states representing a 3d geometry would then be supposed to represent a space - time structure .",
    "it is thus a natural question to ask how can a spin network represent a dynamical process ( happening in spacetime ) .",
    "we propose to view a spin network as a static space - time structure , on which information can flow along the links of the graph . from the spin foam point of view , we can point the spin network as the simple spin foam where the spin network is trivially evolved in such a way that there is no spacetime vertices . while the spin network describes a static spacetime set - up , one can talk about the dynamics of degrees of freedom living on the spin network .",
    "roughly the considered degrees of freedom are the vectors in the @xmath2 representations living on the edges , they evolve along the edges then meet and intertwine at the vertices of the graph .",
    "starting with a set of vectors on some edges , one can follow their evolution through the spin network and see how they are processed .",
    "this way , a spin network state is interpreted as a _ quantum circuit _ : the 3d quantum space is identified with the set of processes that can occur ( on it ) or equivalently with the set of channels along which the ( quantum ) information can flow .",
    "we try to make this concept more precise in the next paragraphs .    working with @xmath2 , it is possible to decompose all representations into a ( symmtrized / antisymmetrized ) tensor product of the fundamental spin @xmath23 representation .",
    "a spin @xmath23 representation is called a _",
    "qubit _ in the field of quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "these qubits meet and are processed at the intertwiners of the spin network , which can be precisely viewed as a circuit .",
    "the fundamental element of these circuits are 4-valent vertices of the spin network which can be interpreted as 2-qubits gates by considering two of the spin @xmath23 representations as ingoing and the two others as outgoing .",
    "the two fundamental intertwiners are the projection on the singlet ( spin 0 ) states and the projection on the spin 1 states . indeed , noting @xmath138 the spin @xmath5 representation , we have @xmath139 and we get define the orthogonal projections @xmath140 of rank one and @xmath141 of rank three respectively projecting on @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath140 is the projection on the bell state @xmath144 while @xmath141 projects onto the three other bell states @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "all possible intertwiners are linear combination of these two operators .",
    "a special class of operators are the unitary processes @xmath147 .",
    "considering that the intertwiners describe all processes which are invariant under global @xmath2 rotation of the two qubits , allowing all individual @xmath2 rotations on each qubit allows us to write any two - qubit gate : we have an exact equivalence between spin networks and qubit circuits .",
    "representations can be considered as the basic building block of spin networks .",
    "they are generated by two states , of spin @xmath148 and of spin @xmath149 , and can be interpreted as two - qubit gates of a quantum circuit.,width=264 ]    instead of decomposing the @xmath2 representations into the fundamental spin @xmath23 representation , one can use the harmonic oscillator presentation and replace each edge of the spin network by a double edge , one line representing the `` left - moving '' oscillator @xmath19 and the other representing the `` right - moving '' oscillator @xmath20 .",
    "these lines meet at the vertices at the graph where they get intertwined . in this formulation , a choice of intertwiner is a choice of ( linear combination of ) @xmath4 operators @xmath150 acting on the double lines arriving at the vertex .",
    "note that the @xmath91 simply acts by moving a quanta of `` energy '' from the oscillators @xmath38 to the oscillators @xmath151 , so that the action of intertwiners is rather simple .",
    "the dynamics on a spin network concerns the flow of the quanta levels of the harmonic oscillators , or more precisely the intertwiners defining the spin network define the evolution of the quanta levels of the harmonic oscillators along the graph underlying the spin network .",
    "now one would really describe the dynamics of the spin network states .",
    "we can think of two ways to possibly implement a hamiltonian constraint or a hamiltonian evolution operator .",
    "one could write the evolution as acting on the harmonic oscillators , not necessarily as the usual standard hamiltonian . or",
    "one could write the evolution as acting on the intertwiners , evolving the @xmath4 states living at the vertices . this latter description would be a generalization to a full spin network of the matrix model dynamics for an intertwiner .",
    "nevertheless , naively , these hamiltonian operators would act on spin network states on a particular graph . either",
    ", one has in mind an effective theory where the graph only describes the 3d space at a coarse - grained level , with the vertices representing the spacetime points or chunk of 3d volumes as seen by an observer . or one should go further and describe a background - independent hamiltonian operator possibly acting on spin networks with support on arbitrary graphs .",
    "although the area and volume operators have been implemented in loop quantum gravity and are well - understood , one can not yet say that the geometry of spin networks is perfectly understood even at the kinematical level .",
    "indeed there are two important issues actually related to the ( space ) diffeomorphism invariance of the quantum states of the theory .",
    "a first question is how to explicitly localize a system in a background independent formalism .",
    "this issue needs to be formulated in relational terms : one localizes an object with respect to another one .",
    "a second question is how to make sense of a superposition of spin networks , or in more precise words , where is one spin network compared to another one if there are both diffeomorphism invariant objects .",
    "these two topics are in fact closely related and the recurring theme is the notion of `` where '' on a spin network state .    to make sense the location of a spin network with respect to another one in a quantum superposition , one should introduce objects , like matter degrees of freedom , on the spin network which can allow to pinpoint locations on that spin network .",
    "one can also introduce by hand geometrical objects like surfaces . from this point of view , a set - up which avoids the conceptual difficulties linked to the interpretation of a superposition of a spin network is the simple configuration of a region bounded by a 2-surface .",
    "once the surface is defined as a set of a fixed number of punctures , one can have any complicated superposition of spin networks describing the geometry of the internal region , but as far as the boundary state is concerned , only the resulting intertwiner between the punctures is relevant and the details of the graphs defining the interior do not matter .",
    "this viewpoint can be generalized to any ( open or closed ) 2-surface .",
    "let us consider a surface in space , as made as @xmath3 discrete patches or @xmath3 punctures .",
    "any spin network state ( possibly superpositions ) for the space geometry will puncture the considered surface and induce an intertwiner between the @xmath3 punctures : the intertwiner defines the quantum state of the surface and describes how the surface is folded i.e. how it is curved and embedded into the 3d space .",
    "this way , the surface state can be defined as a set of probability amplitudes for all possible intertwiners between the @xmath3 punctures and can be interpreted as the state of space geometry as seen by the surface .",
    "now one can generalize these considerations to allow arbitrary numbers of punctures on the surface . however , our point of view is that the geometry state is viewed by some observer with some given resolution .",
    "he will effectively view the surface as made of a finite number of discrete patches ( possibly cutting it into a lattice ) and will describe the state of the surface at that resolution .",
    "later , he get refine or coarse - grain his knowledge of the geometry of the space and of the surface by cutting the surface into more or less patches . refining his knowledge of the surface state",
    ", the observer describes through a bigger number of patches or punctures .",
    "thus from an effective viewpoint , it makes sense to fix the number of punctures @xmath3 to describe a given surface .",
    "but then an important question is how does the surface state ( or space geometry state as seen by the surface ) gets `` renormalized '' under refining or coarse - graining .",
    "it is obvious that the mean values of the geometrical quantities will change",
    ".    a more complete and perhaps satisfying definition of a surface , taking into account the physical relevance of the number of punctures and the possibility of superpositions of states with different numbers of punctures , should involve matter degrees of freedom in order to localize what we call the surface .",
    "else , in the pure geometry theory , nothing tells you that you is still talking about the same surface when changing the number of punctures .",
    "so one needs to first define the surface ( with given number of punctures ) and only then talk about the surrounding geometry state .",
    "this is equivalent to involving an observer who chooses the surface he wants to observe .    pushing the problem of localizing and defining a particular surface in a diffeomorphism invariant theory",
    ", one can say that one can only talk about one unique surface of the 2-sphere topology ( up to possible windings in the 3d space manifold ) since all similar surfaces can be mapped into each other by diffeomorphisms . considering the abstract object of a closed surface with @xmath3 punctures , a quantum state of geometry",
    "then gives the quantum state of the surface i.e. the probability amplitude for all possible intertwiners between the @xmath3 punctures .",
    "turning the argument upside down , one could decide to define the quantum geometry state as the probability amplitudes for intertwiners for all ( abstract ) closed surfaces defined by their number of punctures @xmath3 , their topology and their windings in the space manifold ( depending on its topology ) and all the correlations between the intertwiner probability amplitude distributions for two surfaces and three surfaces and so on .",
    "such a definition of the quantum geometry state is similar to the wick theorem in quantum field theory which allows to reconstruct the hilbert space and quantum vacuum state from all the correlations of the field(s ) .",
    "finally , it would be very interesting to check whether there is actually an equivalence between the usual hilbert space of states of spin networks of lqg and this definition of the quantum state of space geometry as the states of all classes of diffeomorphism equivalent surfaces ( and the correlations between such surfaces ) .",
    "now , let us look more closely at the issue of localizing an object on a spin network state ( or on a superposition ) .",
    "in a diffeomorphism invariant theory , only relations ( correlations ) between objects have physical meaning and the theory has to be understood in purely relational terms . in this context , the notion of quantum reference frame becomes relevant .",
    "indeed , when all is available are correlations between two subsystems @xmath152 and @xmath153 , an interesting physical interpretation comes when @xmath152 can be interpreted as an approximate reference frame , i.e. that it is a system whose state space approximates the group algebra of a classical symmetry group .",
    "particularly relevant cases are the @xmath1 group when @xmath152 defines a quantum clock , or @xmath114 to describe a measurement , or any subgroup of the diffeomorphism in order to get a quantum reference frame allowing to localize objects in a quantum geometry . in the previous sections ,",
    "we have identified a system - a surface with the sphere topology defined as @xmath3 punctures with arbitrary spins - whose state space is group algebra of @xmath51 which can be interpreted as an approximation of the diffeomorphism group of a sphere : we have built a ( quantum ) reference frame allowing to localize points / systems / objects on a sphere .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize this one - sphere system to a multi - sphere system ( each sphere inside the next one ) which would then allow to localize directions in the 3d quantum space .",
    "pushing further the relational viewpoint , one can entirely view the quantum space state as defining a set of correlations / entanglements between the subsystems of the spin networks or equivalently regions of space , the elementary subsystems of a spin network being the nodes and corresponding intertwiners of the spin network ( or alternatively one could choose the edges and vectors living on them )",
    ". then one could forget about the underlying spin networks and simply describe the geometry state as the correlations between a certain number of subsystems representing some regions of space .",
    "in such a set - up , there is a natural notion of distance between two objects . indeed , in a diffeomorphism invariant framework",
    ", it makes sense that two objects are said to be close to each other when there are highly correlated .",
    "we thus propose to construct a notion of distance between two regions of a spin network state ( possibly superposition ) from their degree of entanglement ( or more precisely the ration of their actual entanglement to their maximally allowed entanglement ) .",
    "such construction is to be thought as similar to the entanglement or correlation laws derived in condensed matter systems such as spin systems where the entanglement decreases monotonously with the distance .",
    "this will be investigated in more details in @xcite when we will try compute correlations between the harmonic oscillators or qubits on some spin network background .",
    "to conclude , this work is only preliminary , but the reformulation of lqg in terms of harmonic oscillators helps understanding quantum states of surfaces and seems promising both for the study of the semi - classical states or the dynamics and as a mathematical tool to probe the structure of the spin networks .",
    "more precisely , we can identify the holographic ( kinematical ) degrees of loop quantum gravity and formulate their dynamics in terms of matrix model .",
    "this creates an explicit link between lqg and non - commutative geometry and provides us with new tools to analyze the continuum limit of spin networks and how they can describe the usual smooth manifolds in that limit .",
    "moreover it seems to also open a gate from lqg to string theory .",
    "there are many possible extensions to the present work :    * from the point of view of lqg , it would be interesting to build the operators corresponding to the holonomies , in order to get the full lqg algebra . on the spin network basis , these operators correspond to make the tensor product with some given @xmath2 representation of all the representations on the edges of a given loop of the spin network .",
    "this would allow a full reformulation of lqg .",
    "* it would be interesting to generalize our intertwiner analysis to all surface topologies .",
    "this would mean considering a vertex with @xmath3 external legs and a given number @xmath154 of loops which correspond to the non - contractible cycles of the surface",
    ". then one would like to impose the holonomy around these loops .",
    "this would be helpful to understand the quantum states of ( closed ) surfaces of higher genus and also in order to explore the bridge with string theory .",
    "for the point of view of non - commutative geometry and fuzzy surfaces , we should always find the same @xmath4 algebra .",
    "nevertheless different intertwiners , or equivalently @xmath4 states , will be interpreted as fuzzy surfaces of different topologies and the interpretation becomes clearer in a continuum limit @xmath155 .",
    "* one could investigate the extension of the formalism to super - gravity .",
    "for @xmath156 super - gravity , we would have spin networks with representations of @xmath157 , and it turns out possible to present @xmath157 in terms of harmonic oscillators as we show in appendix .",
    "* since the harmonic oscillator presentation of @xmath15 canonically provides a representation of the lorentz algebra @xmath158 ( see in appendix ) , it would be interesting to identify the resulting lorentz invariant states and check whether they have any relevant physical meaning .",
    "* one can generalize our construction to spin foam models a la barrett - crane@xcite .",
    "then spin networks are labeled by simple representation of the lorentz group ( @xmath159 in the riemannian version and @xmath160 in the lorentzian version ) .",
    "we can present the lorentz algebra as a couple of left / right @xmath15 algebra and thus as a couple of couple of harmonic oscillators @xmath161 .",
    "the energy of the left harmonic oscillators define the left spin while the energy of the right sector defines the right spin",
    ". then simple representations are obtained by imposing the constraint that the energies of the right and left sectors are equal .",
    "* we would like to study more in details the construction of quantum reference frames in spin networks .",
    "this creates a strong link with quantum information where people also try to construct reference frames out of sets of qbits and study their robustness and transition to classicality .",
    "this means using some tools developed in the quantum information field to tackle some of the quantum gravity problems .",
    "but we can also export the quantum gravity results on spin networks to quantum information , using in general the equivalence between quantum circuits and spin networks . on a more precise level , we have presented a system made of @xmath39 harmonic oscillators , or equivalently @xmath3 systems of arbitrary spins , and showed that the decoherence - free subspace under global @xmath2 errors is @xmath51 .",
    "this could be interesting to realize or code unitary operators in quantum computing , or to transport unitaries along a quantum channel while ignoring the reference frames used by the two parties .",
    "more generally , we would like to explore how the geometrical information -distance and curvature- gets encoded in terms of information , entropy and entanglement in the context of loop quantum gravity .    and",
    "finally , the most interesting and difficult problem is the issue of the dynamics : understanding which dynamics to give to the intertwiners and matrix models for boundary states .",
    "we could draw some inspiration from the spectral actions of non - commutative geometry ( using the dirac operator ) or from the matrix models of string theory .",
    "we would like to thank laurent freidel , carlo rovelli , lee smolin for their enthusiasm and encouragements in completing this work , and danny terno , rob spekkens and paolo zanardi for their interest into this work from the point of view of quantum information .",
    "we are grateful to daniele oriti for many discussions on the interplay between quantum information and loop quantum gravity .",
    "we are particularly thankful to simone speziale for a careful reading of an early draft and his comments .",
    "el would also like to thank stephon alexander for a discussion on matrix models in string theory and harold ollivier for a discussion on two - qubits gates .",
    "considering an extra fermionic harmonic oscillator : @xmath163 one can define the following operators : q_+=(ac+cb),q_-=(a c - c b ) .",
    "these operators satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath164 @xmath165=0,\\quad [ j_\\pm , q_\\mp]=-q_\\pm,\\ ] ] @xmath166=\\pm\\f{1}{2}q_\\pm,\\ ] ] so that the operators @xmath167 form the @xmath162 supersymmetric lie algebra",
