    "hamiltonian pdes include a number of model equations in mathematical physics , like the ( generalized ) korteweg - de vries equation ( kdv ) or the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nls ) .",
    "these equations and many others are known to admit rich families of planar traveling wave solutions , with more or less degrees of freedom .",
    "the most ` rigid ' traveling waves are the so - called _ kinks _ , corresponding to heteroclinic orbits of the odes governing their profiles .",
    "_ periodic _ traveling waves , which are the purpose of this paper , have the highest number of degrees of freedom . in between kinks and periodic waves in terms of degrees of freedom ,",
    "we can find _ solitary _ waves , corresponding to homoclinic orbits .",
    "the actual existence of such waves follows from the hamiltonian structure of the governing odes .",
    "we are most interested in their nonlinear stability , even though we can only hope for _ orbital _ stability , because of _ translation invariance_. the most efficient approach to tackle the orbital stability of hamiltonian traveling waves has been known as the grillakis  shatah  strauss ( gss ) theory @xcite , which provides a way of using a _ constrained energy _ as a lyapunov function .",
    "this method crucially relies on the conservation of a quantity associated with translation invariance , termed ` _ _ impulse _ _ ' by benjamin @xcite , and known as the _ momentum _ in the nls literature . for solitary waves ,",
    "the gss theory provides a sufficient stability condition in terms of the convexity of the constrained energy as a function of the wave velocity .",
    "this constrained energy happens to correspond to what was called ` _",
    "_ moment of instability _ _ ' by boussinesq @xcite more than 140 years ago .",
    "resurrected by benjamin @xcite in the early 70s , the ideas of boussinesq have been made rigorous for many types of solitary waves in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite and references in @xcite ) .",
    "together with the evans functions techniques brought in by pego and weinstein @xcite , kapitula and sandstede @xcite , and many others , those pieces of work have led to a clear picture of which solitary waves are stable and which are not .",
    "by contrast , the theory is much less advanced regarding periodic waves .",
    "apart from the higher number of degrees of freedom , the main difficulty comes from the fact that the nice variational framework set up by grillakis , shatah , and strauss does not work for all kinds of perturbations of those waves . as a matter of fact , the theory of _ linear _ stability of periodic waves under ` localized ' perturbations    that is , perturbations going to zero at infinity     is still in its infancy ( see for instance @xcite as regards spectral stability for kdv and the cubic nls , and @xcite for asymptotic linear stability of kdv waves ) , and the nonlinear stability under such perturbations is an open problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have contributed to the field by exhibiting several necessary conditions for the spectral stability of periodic waves in hamiltonian pdes . in particular , they have proved in a rather general setting that the hyperbolicity of the modulated equations `  la whitham ' is necessary for the spectral stability of the underlying wave .",
    "more precisely , the existence of a nonreal eigenvalue for the modulated equations implies a _ sideband instability _ , which means that there are unstable modes for arbritrary small nonzero floquet exponents .",
    "we shall not enter into details about these results here , we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein  see also the recent related analysis in @xcite .",
    "we are going to concentrate on the somehow easier problem of stability with respect to _ co - periodic _ perturbations , that is , perturbations of the same period as the wave ( or equivalently , corresponding to a zero floquet exponent ) .",
    "our aim is to give as a clear picture as in the case of solitary waves , which by the way may be viewed as a limiting case of periodic waves    by letting their wavelength go to infinity .",
    "the great advantage of co - periodic perturbations is that they allow us to use the gss approach in the simplest manner   by using basically only one additional conservation law ( or constraint ) to rule out the ` bad ' directions from the variational framework   , and thus achieve _ nonlinear _ stability results at once .",
    "this has been done for the cubic nls by gallay and haragus @xcite  see also @xcite for more recent results , dealing with _",
    "perturbations , of which the period is a multiple of the period of the wave  , and for the generalized kdv ( gkdv ) by johnson @xcite  for the classical or the modified kdv , see also @xcite , @xcite for co - periodic , orbital stability and @xcite , @xcite for a more general result , which even handles subharmonic perturbations . both nls and gkdv can be viewed as specific cases of the abstract setting we are going to consider . furthermore , this setting is built to include the euler  korteweg system , a fairly general model that is involved in various applications ( superfluids , water waves , incompressible fluid dynamics , and nonlinear optics ) .",

    "in fact , includes both the original formulation of nls , with @xmath13 merely being the skew - symmetric matrix of hamiltonian equations in ` canonical ' coordinates , and its fluid formulation via the madelung transform . in the latter case , @xmath14 from now on",

    "they consist of a sufficient condition for their orbital , co - periodic stability , and a necessary condition for their spectral , co - periodic stability .",
    "both are expressed in terms of the hessian of the _ constrained energy _     to be defined in section [ s : not ] hereafter     viewed as a function of the @xmath0 parameters determining periodic waves .",
    "the value of this constrained energy at a given wave profile happens to be interpreted as an _ abbreviated action _ integral along the corresponding orbit in the phase plane @xmath35 .",
    "remarkably enough , as far as capillary fluids are concerned , that is for the systems ( eke ) and ( ekl ) with an energy of the form @xmath36 the action integral physically corresponds to _",
    "surface tension_. the abbreviated action of periodic wave profiles also admits an interpretation in terms of the averaged equations for modulated wavetrains , in that it is dual to the wavenumber in the generalized gibbs relation satisfied by the averaged energy ( see eqs ( 63)(64 ) in @xcite )   this point of view is investigated further in a forthcoming paper .",
    "co - periodic stability conditions are replacements for the   simpler   ones known for solitary waves .",
    "indeed , while the abbreviated action depends on @xmath0 parameters for periodic waves , it depends on the sole solitary wave velocity once the endstate of solitary waves is fixed in @xmath7 , in which case the abbreviated action merely coincides with the boussinesq moment of instability .",
    "as is often the case , the necessary condition for spectral stability comes from an _",
    "evans function _ calculation , see section [ s : spectral ]",
    ". phrased explicitely , it yields a sufficient condition for spectral instability , which is that the difference between @xmath1 and the negative signature of the hessian of the abbreviated action be odd .    as to the sufficient condition for orbital stability",
    ", it relies on the gss approach , together with a crucial algebraic relation , analogous to what has been pointed in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.3.1 ) and references therein ) .",
    "this relation makes the connection between the negative signatures of two sorts of hessians associated with the constrained energy , namely , the differential operator obtained as the hessian at the wave s profile of the constrained energy viewed as a functional , and the @xmath37 matrix , corresponding to what kapitula and promislow @xcite call a _ constraint matrix _ , and arising here as the hessian of the abbreviated action integral under the constraint that the period of waves is fixed .",
    "this leads us to introduce a most important _ orbital stability index_. all this is made more precise in section [ s : not ] below , and those necessary / sufficient stability criteria are actually derived in an abstract setting in sections [ s : spectral ] and [ s : orb ] .",
    "section [ s : ex ] is then devoted to the application of these abstract results to ( qkdv ) , ( ekl ) , and ( eke ) , with energies as in .",
    "a striking result is that , in all these cases , our sufficient condition for orbital stability mostly relies on the simple requirement that the negative signature of the hessian of the abbreviated action be equal to @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we point out a close connexion between stability criteria for ( qkdv ) and for the euler  korteweg systems ( ekl ) and ( eke ) . we show in section [ ss :",
    "ek ] that the systems ( ekl ) and ( eke ) share the very same abbreviated action integral and constrained energy , in which the parameters of the waves turn out to be pairwise exchanged  as well as the constraints actually , if the period itself is considered as a constraint .",
    "this readily implies that our spectral stability criterion coincides for these systems .",
    "furthermore , we prove that ( eke ) and ( ekl ) actually have the same orbital stability index , equal to the negative signature of the hessian of the abbreviated action minus two , even though the negative signatures of the unconstrained variational hessians of respective lagrangians can differ from each other . regarding spectral stability with respect to ` arbitrary ' perturbations  and not only co - periodic perturbations",
    " we even show that the differential operators involved in the linearized systems associated with ( eke ) and ( ekl ) are _ isospectral_. even though this seems a very natural result , the underlying conjugacy between eigenfunctions is far from being trivial .",
    "moreover , we stress that the spectral conjugacy is not restricted to co - periodic boundary conditions and respects the floquet exponent by floquet exponent bloch - wave decomposition .",
    "both spectral and variational connections are pointed out here for the first time , up to the authors knowledge .    some more specific examples  dictated by more or less classical choices of nonlinearities",
    " are then investigated numerically in section [ s : ex ] .",
    "this part relies very much on the fact that all our stability criteria are expressed in terms of the abbreviated action integral , which can be computed in the phase plane without any need of an ode solver .",
    "its derivatives are then computed by means of finite differences .",
    "the coexistence of two grids of discretization  one for the integral and one for finite differences , and the high condition number of the hessian matrices that are to be computed , induce some numerical difficulties that have been coped with by a suitable choice of mesh sizes .",
    "numerous numerical experiments have been conducted , and their results are in accordance with those that can be computed analytically .",
    "in particular , our routine for computing the hessian of the abbreviated action integral enables us to recover in a very precise way  and up to the small amplitude limit and to the soliton limit  the eigenvalues of modulated equations associated with some well - known completely integrable pdes ( namely , kdv , mkdv , and cubic nls ) , as displayed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .    coming back to the analytical part of our results ,",
    "let us mention the following , important difficulty . in order to actually prove some orbital stability , we need a suitable local well - posedness theory for the cauchy problem .",
    "this kind of result is of course heavily model - dependent .",
    "if there is for instance a huge literature on ( g)kdv , it does not seem that anyone ever looked at the cauchy problem for ( qkdv ) when the ` capillarity ' factor @xmath38 in @xmath39 is not constant .",
    "this is done in a forthcoming paper @xcite . regarding ( eke ) and ( ekl ) ,",
    "still with energies as in with variable @xmath40 and @xmath38 , what we need is a basic adaptation to the 1d torus of earlier results dealing with the cauchy problem on the whole real line @xcite .",

    "a most important fact is that these systems share the very same abbreviated action , @xmath122 defined in , where @xmath123 is the speed of eke waves , @xmath124 is the ` speed ' of ekl waves , and the roles of the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath125 are exchanged when we go from ( ekl ) to ( eke ) and vice versa : @xmath62 is an _ energy level _ for eke waves and a _ lagrange multiplier _ for ekl waves , @xmath125 is a lagrange multiplier for eke waves and an energy level for ekl waves and @xmath125 with a meaning in the ` concrete ' examples ( ekl ) and ( eke ) that is slightly different from their meaning in the abstract framework , see table [ tb : notations ] . ] . as a consequence , the stability criteria which are expressed only in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127 coincide for corresponding eke waves and ekl waves .",

    "the fact that waves should be simultaneously stable in both formulations seems very natural from a physical point of view .",
    "however , this is not that obvious to prove mathematically , because the mass lagrangian coordinates are obtained from the eulerian coordinates through a nonlinear and nonlocal change of variables that depends on the solution itself .    as far as spectral stability is concerned , and not only co - periodic stability actually , we prove in theorem [ thm : conj ] ( also see remark [ thm : conj ] ) that the corresponding linearized operators are indeed _ isospectral_. the proof is quite simple once we reformulate the nonlinear problems in a suitable way , but it reveals that the kind of conjugacy between those operators is not trivial .",
    "we are not aware of any earlier result of this type .    as regards the co - periodic orbital stability , its simultaneous occurrence in both formulations ( ekl ) and ( eke )",
    "is supported by the idea that corresponding eke waves and ekl waves share the same constrained functional @xmath130 $ ] , and that the constraints are preserved by passing from eulerian coordinates to mass lagrangian coordinates constraints @xmath131 . ] .",
    "if the vanishing of our orbital stability index were exactly equivalent to the fact that the functional @xmath130 $ ] has a local minimum on the constrained manifold @xmath132 at the wave profile and its translates , this would show the equivalence of co - periodic orbital stability for ( ekl ) and ( eke ) .",
    "we find out that the issue is a little more subtle by looking at our abstract result , theorem [ thm : orb ] .",
    "recalling that the roles of the ` concrete ' parameters @xmath62 and @xmath125 are exchanged when we go from ( eke ) to ( ekl ) , we see that the main assumptions for applying theorem [ thm : orb ] to ( eke ) and ( ekl ) are , @xmath133 for the former ( see theorem [ thm : ekeorb ] ) , and @xmath134 for the latter ( see theorem [ thm : eklorb ] ) .",
    "the slight discrepancy between these two sets of conditions obviously comes from the derivatives @xmath94 and @xmath135 , which correspond respectively to the derivative with respect to @xmath62 of the wave period in eulerian coordinates  @xmath62 being the energy level in these coordinates  and the derivative with respect to @xmath125 of the wave period in mass lagrangian coordinates  @xmath125 being the energy level in these coordinates .",
    "they are not a priori related to each other .",
    "however , as long as we regard the vanishing of either @xmath94 or @xmath135 as anomalous transitions , we can indeed think of the periodic waves as being simultaneously orbitally stable with respect to co - periodic perturbations in eulerian coordinates and mass lagrangian coordinates .",
    "again , this is not that an obvious result , because the meaning of co - periodic perturbations is different from one formulation to the other for more details . ] .",
    "finally , it turns out from a simple algebraic computation that for ( ekl ) the negative signature of the hessian of the constrained hamiltonian in mass lagrangian coordinates coincides with the negative signature of the qkdv operator , @xmath136\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is the qkdv impulse , and @xmath138 is prescribed by the speed of the ekl wave .",
    "two ingredients then lead to a set of sufficient stability conditions for ( ekl ) .",
    "the first one is that , as mentioned above , @xmath139 is known in terms of the sign of @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is an alternative notation for the abbreviated action associated with qkdv waves  to avoid confusion with the one associated with ek waves , still denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "the second ingredient follows from the observation that @xmath71 is explicitly related to @xmath141 , so that by the chain rule @xmath142 can be expressed in terms of @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",

    "<S> the stability theory of periodic traveling waves is much less advanced than for solitary waves , which were first studied by boussinesq and have received a lot of attention in the last decades . in particular , despite recent breakthroughs regarding periodic waves in reaction - diffusion equations and viscous systems of conservation laws [ johnson  noble  rodrigues  </S>",
    "<S> zumbrun , invent math ( 2014 ) ] , the stability of periodic traveling wave solutions to dispersive pdes with respect to ` arbitrary ' perturbations is still widely open in the absence of a dissipation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is put here on _ co - periodic _ stability of periodic waves , that is , stability with respect to perturbations of the same period as the wave , for kdv - like systems of one - dimensional hamiltonian pdes . </S>",
    "<S> fairly general nonlinearities are allowed in these systems , so as to include various models of mathematical physics , and this precludes complete integrability techniques . </S>",
    "<S> stability criteria are derived and investigated first in a general abstract framework , and then applied to three basic examples that are very closely related , and ubiquitous in mathematical physics , namely , a quasilinear version of the generalized korteweg  de vries equation ( qkdv ) , and the euler  korteweg system in both eulerian coordinates ( eke ) and in mass lagrangian coordinates ( ekl ) . those criteria consist of a necessary condition for _ spectral stability _ , and of a sufficient condition for _ orbital stability_. both are expressed in terms of a single function , the abbreviated action integral along the orbits of waves in the phase plane , which is the counterpart of the solitary waves moment of instability introduced by boussinesq </S>",
    "<S> . however , the resulting criteria are more complicated for periodic waves because they have more degrees of freedom than solitary waves , so that the action is a function of @xmath0 variables for a system of @xmath1 pdes , while the moment of instability is a function of the wave speed only once the endstate of the solitary wave is fixed . regarding solitary waves , the celebrated grillakis  shatah  </S>",
    "<S> strauss stability criteria amount to looking for the sign of the second derivative of the moment of instability with respect to the wave speed . for periodic waves , </S>",
    "<S> stability criteria involve all the second order , partial derivatives of the action . </S>",
    "<S> this had already been pointed out by various authors for some specific equations , in particular the generalized korteweg  de vries equation  which is special case of ( qkdv )  but not from a general point of view , up to the authors knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking results obtained here can be summarized as : an _ odd _ value for the difference between @xmath1 and the negative signature of the hessian of the action implies spectral instability , whereas a negative signature of the same hessian being equal to @xmath1 implies orbital stability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is shown that , when applied to the euler  korteweg system , this approach yields several interesting connexions between ( eke ) , ( ekl ) , and ( qkdv ) . more precisely , ( eke ) and ( ekl ) share the same abbreviated action integral , which is related to that of ( qkdv ) in a simple way . </S>",
    "<S> this basically proves simultaneous stability in both formulations ( eke ) and ( ekl )  as one may reasonably expect from the physical point view  , which is interesting to know when these models are used for different phenomena  _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ shallow water waves or nonlinear optics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , stability in ( eke ) and ( ekl ) is found to be linked to stability in the scalar equation ( qkdv ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the relevant stability criteria are merely encoded by the negative signature of @xmath2 matrices , they can at least be checked numerically . in practice , when @xmath3 or @xmath4 , this can be done without even requiring an ode solver . </S>",
    "<S> various numerical experiments are presented , which clearly discriminate between stable cases and unstable cases for ( qkdv ) , ( eke ) and ( ekl ) , thus confirming some known results for the generalized kdv equation and the nonlinear schrdinger equation , and pointing out some new results for more general ( systems of ) pdes .    </S>",
