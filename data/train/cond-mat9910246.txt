    "almost twenty years ago , bergman@xcite developed the spectral approach for calculating the dielectric constant and other linear response functions of a two - component composite .",
    "his approach was to study the analytical properties of the effective dielectric constant , viewed as a function of the ratio of the dielectric constants of the constituents . among other results",
    ", he showed that all poles of this function can be expressed as eigenvalues of a certain linear boundary - value problem , while the residues of those poles are given as certain integrals over the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "bergman s theory actually describes a wide class of mathematically similar physical problems in which a divergence - free field appears as a linear response to the gradient of a potential ; thus , it can be used to find the effective electrical and thermal conductivities , magnetic permeability and many other effective parameters described by mathematically equivalent equations .    in some microgeometries",
    ", this eigenproblem can be solved by expanding the exact eigenfunctions of the composite in terms of the individual grain eigenfunctions .",
    "this approach has been used to calculate the effective parameters of granular composites corresponding to several different ordered microgeometries@xcite .",
    "however , the spectral representation is often useful even in composites where the microgeometry is not known exactly ; in such cases , one must generally resort to various approximations in order to calculate the relevant spectral functions .",
    "moreover , the spectral approach is not limited to problems involving _ linear _ response .",
    "for example , some of the effective macroscopic nonlinear response functions can be expressed in terms of linear response functions of the composite , and certain geometric factors@xcite .",
    "recently , this connection has been employed@xcite , together with certain approximations for linear composites , to use the spectral representation in calculating these nonlinear response functions .",
    "the present paper is directed towards the linear and nonlinear dielectric response of _ polycrystalline _ materials .",
    "such materials are not generally thought of as composite media , but in fact they behave like composites .",
    "the reason is that even though each crystallite is made of the same material , it has a different spatial orientation and hence has different constitutive properties referred to axes fixed in the lab coordinate system . in particular , in this paper we extend the spectral theory to describe both the linear and nonlinear response of a polycrystalline material .    by a polycrystal , we mean a material with anisotropic transport properties , such that the crystal symmetry axes vary in direction from point to point in space .",
    "several previous workers ( see , for example , @xcite ) have described polycrystals as composite materials . in the present work ,",
    "we further restrict our discussion to polycrystals of uniaxial materials . in this case ,",
    "two of the three principal components of the dielectric tensor are equal , and it is more straightforward to develop a spectral representation for the effective properties .",
    "this restriction to uniaxial materials still leave many classes of crystalline materials open to study .",
    "in particular , the theory should satisfactorily describe such classes of materials as the quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors@xcite , or the quasi - planar or cu@xmath0o -based high - t@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "we will use this approach not only to describe the linear properties , but also to calculate the enhancement of the third - order nonlinear susceptibility of a polycrystal .",
    "although this enhancement has been previously discussed theoretically@xcite , the treatment presented in that previous discussion needs to be modified in the case of a complex - valued susceptibility , as has been pointed out by ma@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the extension of the spectral theory to uniaxial polycrystalline materials .",
    "the application of this theory to the nonlinear response of polycrystals is given in section iii , followed by a numerical example in section iv .",
    "we consider a polycrystalline dielectric material characterized by a position - dependent uniaxially symmetric dielectric tensor , which we express in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dielectric tensor in the frame of principal axis and @xmath4 is a position - dependent orthogonal matrix characterizing the microstructure of a particular specimen ( specifically , it describes the local orientation of the principal axes with respect to the lab axes ) .",
    "if the sample is macroscopically isotropic , it is reasonable to assume that on a large scale its dielectric behavior can be characterized by a scalar dielectric constant @xmath5 . @xmath5",
    "may be defined by the relation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the space - averaged electric field .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is real and is directed along the @xmath9 axis : @xmath10 . in general , the fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( as well as the dielectric tensor ) are represented as complex quantities ; the physical fields are related to them through @xmath13 , @xmath14 .    in the quasi - static approximation , the electric field",
    "is given by the negative gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "we may express this potential through the relation by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is real and @xmath17 is the solution to the following boundary - value problem :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the boundary surrounding @xmath20 .",
    "using the boundary conditions for @xmath17 and the maxwell s equation @xmath21 , we can show that@xcite : @xmath22dv \\nonumber\\\\   & = &   \\frac 1v \\oint{\\bf d } ( -e_0\\phi)\\cdot { \\bf ds }    = \\frac 1v \\oint{\\bf d } ( -e_0\\phi_0)\\cdot { \\bf ds } \\\\   & = & \\frac 1v \\int \\nabla \\cdot\\left[{\\bf d } ( -e_0\\phi_0)\\right]dv   = \\frac 1v \\int { \\bf d}\\cdot(e_0 { \\bf \\nabla } z ) dv    = { \\bf d_0 \\cdot e_0}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the definition ( [ defeps_e ] ) is equivalent to @xmath23 the result ( 6 ) is the equation we use below to express @xmath5 in terms of eigenvalues of a linear operator .    in order to achieve this reduction , we first note that instead of the position - dependent tensor @xmath24 we can use @xmath25 where the parameter @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a matrix with @xmath29 and other components equal to zero",
    ". we can use this result to rewrite the first line of ( [ bvp ] ) as @xmath30 where we have used @xmath31 , and also employed the convention that repeated indices are summed over . from eq .",
    "( [ transformedbvp ] ) , we see that ( [ bvp ] ) is equivalent to the integral equation @xmath32 here the linear operator @xmath33 is defined by its effect on a function @xmath17 through @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a green s function for the laplace operator : @xmath36    it is now convenient to define a scalar product of two functions by @xmath37 with this definition , we can show that @xmath33 is self - adjoint , non - negative , bounded linear operator . to show the self - adjoint property",
    ", we integrate ( [ gammadef ] ) by parts using the boundary conditions for @xmath38 to obtain @xmath39 then , using the fact that @xmath38 satisfies @xmath40 , we find that    @xmath41    to prove that @xmath33 is real , bounded and non - negative , we consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the value of @xmath26 at one of the eigenstates @xmath45 ( the so - called `` electrostatic resonances '' )",
    ". the physical significance of the latter has been discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "next , we note that the problem defined by eq .",
    "( [ eigenintegral ] ) is equivalent to the problem    @xmath46=0,\\\\ \\phi_i=0 \\text { at the boundary}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    as can be seen by comparing the steps going from ( [ bvp ] ) to ( [ bvpintegral ] ) .",
    "but from eq .",
    "( [ eigendiff ] ) , we can write @xmath47 from which it follows that @xmath48 . the limiting case @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) could be realized only if the tensor @xmath51 were position - independent . but this would lead to @xmath52 , i.  e. , a tensor , which contradicts our assumption that @xmath5 is a scalar value .",
    "the fact that the eigenvalues of ( [ eigenintegral ] ) are limited to the semiclosed segment @xmath53 proves our statement that @xmath33 is real , bounded , and non - negative .    from the properties of @xmath33",
    ", we conclude that the eigenfunctions @xmath54 of ( [ eigenintegral ] ) form a complete orthogonal set with respect to the scalar product ( [ scalpr ] ) .",
    "hence , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ bvpintegral ] ) can be expressed ( except on the boundary ) as @xmath55 we can now use this equation to find an analytical representation for @xmath5 .",
    "we begin by using green s theorem , the boundary conditions in ( [ bvp ] ) for @xmath17 , and the maxwell equation @xmath56 to rewrite eq.([eps_e ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath57 if we now introduce a function @xmath58 then on substituting ( [ solution ] ) we find @xmath59 this final result is identical in form to bergman s expression for the analogous function in scalar composite materials .",
    "the only difference lies in the definition of the scalar product ( [ scalpr ] ) .",
    "as has been suggested by several authors ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the nonlinear susceptibilities of composite materials may be hugely enhanced by large fluctuations in the local electric field in these materials .",
    "the basic idea is as follows : since these nonlinear susceptibilities depend on higher powers of the local electric field than does the linear dielectric function @xmath60 , any enhancement of that field will produce an even larger enhancement in those susceptibilities than in @xmath5 .",
    "a theoretical description of this enhancement has been given by several authors , initially for isotropic composite materials@xcite , and more recently for polycrystals@xcite .",
    "the original exact expression given in @xcite is generally difficult to evaluate without approximations .",
    "one useful approximation involves a decoupling assumption : a certain average of the fourth power of the electric field , which enters the exact expression , is approximated as a product of averages of second powers@xcite .",
    "however , this decoupling approximation ( as well as the original exact expression ) must be modified slightly when the material of interest has a complex - valued dielectric tensor .",
    "the need for such a modification was first noted by ma _",
    "et al _ , who also generalize the approach of @xcite for the case of components with complex scalar dielectric functions . in",
    "what follows , we further generalize the approach of ma _",
    "et al_@xcite to the case of polycrystals , using the results of sec .",
    "we consider a polycrystalline material in which @xmath61 and @xmath62 are related by @xmath63 where we suppress the frequency and position dependence of all quantities and sum over repeated indices .",
    "next , we assume that a sufficiently large sample of this polycrystal can be treated as macroscopically isotropic . thus , the effective response at the fundamental frequency @xmath64 is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the spatial average of the electric field . in component notation , this may be written    @xmath67    where @xmath68 denotes a volume average and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the @xmath71 components of @xmath72 and @xmath66 .",
    "the method of ref.@xcite does not permit the two effective susceptibilities to be easily calculated independently , but their sum is readily computed .",
    "generalizing eq .",
    "( 13 ) of ref .",
    "[ poly ] to the case of finite frequencies , we obtain    @xmath73    where @xmath74 denotes the cartesian component of the local electric field at frequency @xmath64 in the corresponding _ linear _ polycrystal . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the fourth - rank tensor @xmath75 has certain symmetry properties which cause many of its components to vanish .",
    "specifically , we will assume that the only non - vanishing components of @xmath75 ( in a frame of reference where the coordinate axes are parallel to the local symmetry axes of the crystallite ) are those such that the indices are equal in pairs .",
    "( [ defchie ] ) takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the field component parallel to the i@xmath78 principal axis at * x * ( where we suppress the frequency index @xmath64 ) .",
    "we approximate the right - hand side using the nonlinear decoupling approximation ( nda)@xcite , which is specified by the assumption @xmath79 then using the expression @xmath80 we immediately get@xcite : @xmath81 here the partial derivative denotes @xmath82 . in the case of a uniaxial material , one should calculate this derivative first with @xmath83 , and only then take the limit @xmath84",
    ".    the second average on the right - hand side of ( [ ndadefinition ] ) can be evaluated@xcite with the help of the spectral approach developed in the previous section . from ( [ solution ] ) and our definition ( [ scalpr ] ) of the scalar product , we find @xmath85 where we have used the orthogonality condition @xmath86 .    to evaluate @xmath87",
    ", we note that the boundary conditions ( [ bvp ] ) for @xmath17 and for @xmath88 are the same , since @xmath89 is real on the boundary .",
    "therefore , we can use @xmath90 in place of @xmath91 in the transformations ( [ edtransformation ] ) , so that the definition ( [ eps_e ] ) becomes @xmath92 where we used @xmath93 .",
    "hence , @xmath94 given an approximation for the effective _ linear _ response function @xmath60 , the above formulas allow us to calculate the enhancement of the non - linear susceptibility .",
    "the simplest approximation for @xmath95 is the effective - medium approximation ( ema)@xcite , which gives    @xmath96    or for a uniaxial material ,    @xmath97    then the function @xmath98 [ eq .",
    "( 21)]is given by    @xmath99    the corresponding @xmath33 operator has a continuous spectrum , so that the sums in ( [ fofs ] ) , ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) should be replaced by integrals . from    @xmath100",
    "we find that    @xmath101= \\frac 3{4\\pi } \\sqrt{\\frac{(x-8/9)}x } \\theta(-x)\\theta(x-8/9),\\ ] ]    where @xmath102 is the usual step function , i.  e. , @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 . in order to evaluate the effective nonlinear response",
    ", this expression should be substituted into the integrals @xmath107",
    "@xmath108    one immediate consequence of the ema is that the integral in ( [ integrale2 ] ) diverges as @xmath109 ( i.  e. , as @xmath110 ) , and hence , @xmath87 also diverges in the same limit .",
    "this divergence is related to the divergence of @xmath111 [ eq .",
    "( 29 ) ] ; the physical origin of that latter divergence was discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the nda / ema approximation , if @xmath112 @xmath113 becomes _ arbitrarily large _ when @xmath110 , both at zero and at finite frequencies .",
    "to illustrate this discussion , we consider a simple model for a polycrystalline quasi-1d conductor . in the high - conductivity direction ,",
    "we assume a drude metal with dielectric function @xmath114 in the perpendicular directions we assume a constant dielectric function @xmath115 the resulting complex frequency - dependent @xmath116 , as given in the ema , is shown in fig .",
    "1 .    fig .",
    "2 shows the corresponding nda prediction [ eqs.([chi_e])-([e2 ] ) ] for the enhancement of the cubic nonlinearity in the same polycrystal , under the assumption that @xmath5 ( and @xmath98 ) are given by the ema . for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the results of an earlier and less accurate approximation@xcite .",
    "the results in fig .  3 are obtained by using @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 , and evaluating @xmath119 using eq .",
    "( [ squarede ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , based on our simple example , the effects of the correction noted by@xcite appear to be relatively minor if only the diagonal elements @xmath120 , but are more substantial if @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "nonetheless , the corrections do introduce a nonzero correction to all the elements of the tensor @xmath123 .",
    "the numerical correction can be seen always to increase the absolute value of the corresponding matrix element of @xmath123 .",
    "this trend can be qualitatively understood as follows : the spatial average @xmath124 which enters into the uncorrected matrix elements can , in principle , even vanish under some conditions , but the absolute value @xmath125 can never vanish .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the limitations of the present approach , and the validity of the approximations made . at various points in this paper , we have made the following approximations :    * the quasistatic approximation ; * the nonlinear decoupling approximation ; and * the effective - medium approximation .",
    "we now discuss the limitations of each of these approximations .",
    "the _ quasistatic approximation _ is embodied in eq .",
    "( [ bvp ] ) , which implies that the electric field can be expressed as the negative gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "this assumption is still valid at finite frequencies , provided that the material of interest lies in the _ long - wavelength limit _ ( see , for example , ref .",
    "a polycrystalline material is likely to fall in this long - wavelength regime , provided that the typical size of a crystallite is small compared to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the medium . at optical frequencies , this condition requires crystallites of linear dimensions only a few hundred  , but the same approximation might hold at microwave frequencies even for micron - size crystallites .",
    "more generally , any structural correlations in the polycrystal should exist only a scale which is small compared to the wavelength ; otherwise , there is likely to be significant scattering of electromagnetic radiation and the quasistatic approximation will break down .",
    "our derivation of the spectral representation for a polycrystal is based on the quasistatic approximation .",
    "furthermore , our definition of an effective linear dielectric function @xmath60 [ eq .",
    "( [ defeps_e ] ) ] presupposes the quasistatic approximation . indeed ,",
    "if the quasistatic approximation does not hold , the composite can not easily be described in terms of an effective dielectric function .    the _ nonlinear decoupling approximation _ ( nda ) is a way of approximately calculating the fourth moment of the electric field in the polycrystal , by breaking this up into a product of two second - moment terms .",
    "the nda is known to be quite inaccurate near percolation thresholds in conventional composite materials and most likely also in polycrystalline materials@xcite .",
    "the reason for the inaccuracy is that the nda neglects local fluctuations in electric fields which become very important near a percolation threshold .",
    "however , if one does not make the nda , than there is no easy way to express this nonlinear susceptibility in terms of the spectral function which describes the _ linear _ properties of the polycrystal .",
    "( [ chi_e]-[e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , which are based on our use of the quasistatic approximation and nda , are equally valid for any microgeometry of a polycrystal and can be used with any desired approximation for the second moments . on the other hand , the spectral function @xmath98",
    ", corresponding to the actual distribution of the electric field , may be sensitive to the particular arrangement of the crystallites .",
    "we use the _ effective - medium approximation _ ( ema ) to calculate the spectral function which characterizes the linear dielectric function @xmath60 .",
    "although the ema does predict the occurrence of a percolation threshold in a polycrystalline material , the approximation is likely to be quite inaccurate near that threshold , since it treats each crystallite as being embedded in an effective environment .",
    "note that the spectral representation itself is more general than the ema , since it is always applicable in the quasistatic approximation .",
    "hence , the spectral representation can be used in conjunction with other , more accurate methods of calculating the linear response @xmath60 , which take better account of local environment of a given crystallite , if such methods can be found .",
    "we emphasize again that neither the nda nor the ema are necessary approximations ; if better approximations for the fourth moment and for the linear response are available , then these can be used to compute the cubic nonlinear susceptibility of a polycrystalline material .",
    "the inaccuracy of the nda and the ema is partially compensated by the simplicity of these approximations , which allow many properties to be computed nearly in closed , analytic form .    to summarize , in this paper",
    ", we have extended the spectral representation of bergman so that it applies to the linear effective dielectric function of a uniaxial polycrystal .",
    "the extension is straightforward , but should be useful in a wide variety of materials . as an illustration , we give the spectral function for a polycrystal in which @xmath60 is given in the effective - medium approximation .",
    "finally , we use this spectral function to calculate the cubic nonlinear susceptibility tensor @xmath113 for a uniaxial polycrystal in the nonlinear decoupling approximation ( nda ) , once again calculating the required electric field averages within the ema . as in two - component composites of isotropic materials ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath113 are slightly altered from previous results when one properly accounts for the fact@xcite that the averages @xmath126 and @xmath127 are unequal .",
    "we also give a brief discussion of the conditions under which these various expressions and approximations are applicable to real polycrystalline materials .",
