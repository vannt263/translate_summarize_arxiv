    "his master s thesis of 1938 , claude shannon demonstrated how boolean algebra can be used to synthesize and simplify relay circuits , establishing the foundation of modern digital circuit design @xcite .",
    "later , deterministic switches were replaced with probabilistic switches to make stochastic switching circuits , which were studied in @xcite .",
    "there are a few features of stochastic switching circuits that make them very similar to neural systems .",
    "first , randomness is inherent in neural systems and it may play a crucial role in thinking and reasoning .",
    "switching ( and relaying ) technique provides us a natural way of manipulating this randomness .",
    "second , in a switching system , each switch can be treated as either a memory element or a control element for computing .",
    "this might enable creating an intelligent system where storage and computing are highly integrated . in this paper , we study stochastic switching circuits from a basic starting point with focusing on probability synthesis .",
    "we consider two - terminal stochastic switching circuits , where each probabilistic switch , or _ pswitch _ ,",
    "is closed with some probability chosen from a finite set of rational numbers , called a _",
    "pswitch set_. by selecting pswitches with different probabilities and composing them in appropriate ways , we can realize a variety of different closure probabilities .    formally , for a two - terminal stochastic switching circuit @xmath8 ,",
    "the probabilities of pswitches are taken from a fixed pswitch set @xmath9 , and all these pswitches are open or closed independently .",
    "we use @xmath10 to denote the probability that the two terminals of @xmath8 are connected , and call @xmath10 the _ closure probability _ of @xmath8 . given a pswitch set @xmath9",
    ", a probability @xmath11 can be _ realized _ if and only if there exists a circuit @xmath8 such that @xmath12 . based on the ways of composing pswitches , we have series - parallel ( sp ) circuits and non - series - parallel ( non - sp ) circuits .",
    "an sp circuit consists of either a single pswitch or two sp circuits connected in series or parallel , see the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](a ) and [ fig_circuitexamples](b ) as examples . the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](c ) is a non - sp circuit .",
    "a special type of sp circuits is called simple - series - parallel ( ssp ) circuits .",
    "an ssp circuit is either a single pswitch , or is built by taking an ssp circuit and adding another pswitch in either series or parallel .",
    "for example , the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](a ) is an ssp circuit but the one in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](b ) is not .    in this paper",
    ", we first study the robustness of different stochastic switching circuits in the presence of small error perturbations .",
    "we assume that the probabilities of individual pswitches are taken from a fixed pswitch set with a given error allowance of @xmath0 ; that is , the error probabilities of the pswitches are bounded by @xmath0 .",
    "we show that ssp circuits are robust to small error perturbations , but the error probability of a general sp circuit may be amplified by adding additional pswitches .",
    "these results might help us understand why local errors do not accumulate in a natural system , and how to enhance the robustness of a system when designing a circuit .",
    "next , we study the problem of synthesizing desired probabilities with stochastic switching circuits .",
    "we mainly focus on ssp circuits due to their robustness against small error perturbations .",
    "two main questions are addressed : ( 1 ) _ expressibility _ : given the pswitch set @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is an integer , what kind of probabilities can be realized using stochastic switching circuits ? and how many pswitches are sufficient to realize them ? ( 2 ) _",
    "approximation _ : given an arbitrary pswitch set @xmath9 , how can we construct a stochastic switching circuit using as a few as possible pswitches , to get a good approximation of the desired probabilities ?    the study of probability synthesis based on stochastic switching circuits has widespread applications .",
    "recently , people found that dna molecules can be constructed that closely approximate the dynamic behavior of arbitrary systems of coupled chemical reactions @xcite , which leads to the field of molecular computing @xcite .",
    "in such systems , the quantities of molecules involved in a reaction are often surprisingly small , and the exact sequence of reactions is determined by chance @xcite .",
    "stochastic switching circuits provide a simple and powerful tool to manipulate stochasticity in molecular systems . comparing with combinational logic circuits ,",
    "stochastic switching circuits are easier to implement using molecular reactions .",
    "another type of applications is probabilistic electrical systems without sophisticated computing components . in such systems ,",
    "stochastic switching circuits have many advantages in generating desired probabilities , including its constructive simplicity , robustness , and low cost .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section [ section_relatedworks ] describes related work and introduces some existing results on stochastic switching circuits . in section [ section_robustness ]",
    ", we analyze the robustness of different kinds of stochastic switching circuits .",
    "then we discuss the expressibility of stochastic switching circuits in section [ section_scenario1 ] and probability approximation in section [ section_scenario2 ] , followed by the conclusion in section [ switch_section_conclusion ] .",
    "there are a number of studies related to the problem of generating desired distributions from the algorithmic perspective .",
    "this problem dates back to von neumann @xcite , who considered of simulating an unbiased coin using a biased coin with unknown probability .",
    "later , elias @xcite improved this algorithm such that the expected number of unbiased random bits generated per coin toss is asymptotically equal to the entropy of the biased coin . on the other hand",
    ", people have considered the case that the probability distribution of the tossed coin is known .",
    "knuth and yao @xcite have given a procedure to generate an arbitrary probability using an unbiased coin .",
    "han and hoshi @xcite have demonstrated how to generate an arbitrary probability using a general @xmath14-sided biased coin .",
    "all these works aim to efficiently convert one distribution to another .",
    "however , they require computing models and may not be applicable for some simple or distributed electrical / molecular systems .",
    "there are a number of studies focusing on synthesizing a simple physical device to generate desired probabilities .",
    "gill @xcite@xcite discussed the problem of generating rational probabilities using a sequential state machine .",
    "motivated by neural computation , jeavons et al . provided an algorithm to generate binary sequences with probability @xmath15 from a set of stochastic binary sequences with probabilities in @xmath16 @xcite",
    "their method can be implemented using the concept of linear feedback shift registers .",
    "recently , inspired by pcmos technology @xcite , qian et al .",
    "considered the synthesis of decimal probabilities using combinational logic @xcite .",
    "they have considered three different scenarios , depending on whether the given probabilities can be duplicated , and whether there is freedom to choose the probabilities . in contact to the foregoing contributions",
    ", we consider the properties and probability synthesis of stochastic switching circuits .",
    "our approach is orthogonal and complementary to that of qian and riedel , which is based on combinational logic .",
    "generally , each switching circuit can be equivalently expressed by a combinational logic circuit .",
    "all the constructive methods of stochastic switching circuits in this paper can be directly applied to probabilistic combinational logic circuits .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we introduce the original work that started the study on stochastic switching circuits ( wilhelm and bruck @xcite ) . similar to resistor circuits @xcite , connecting one terminal of a switching circuit @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) to one terminal of a circuit @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 ) places them in series .",
    "the resulting circuit is closed if and only if both of @xmath17 and @xmath19 are closed , so the probability of the resulting circuit is @xmath21 connecting both terminals of @xmath17 and @xmath19 together places the circuits in parallel .",
    "the resulting circuit is closed if and only if either @xmath17 or @xmath19 is closed , so the probability of the resulting circuit is @xmath22 based on these rules , we can calculate the probability of any given ssp or sp circuit .",
    "for example , the probability of the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](a ) is @xmath23 and the probability of the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](b ) is @xmath24    let us consider the non - sp circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig_circuitexamples](c ) . in this circuit",
    ", we call the pswitch in the middle a ` bridge ' .",
    "if the bridge is closed , the circuit has a closure probability of @xmath25 .",
    "if the bridge is open , the circuit has a closure probability of @xmath26 .",
    "since the bridge is closed with probability @xmath27 , the overall probability of the circuit is @xmath28    an important and interesting question is that if @xmath9 is uniform , i.e. , @xmath29 for some @xmath1 , what kind of probabilities can be realized using stochastic switching circuits ? in @xcite , wilhelm and bruck proposed an optimal algorithm ( called b - algorithm ) to realize all rational probabilities of the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 , using an ssp circuit when @xmath32 . in their algorithm , at most @xmath4 pswitches are used , which is optimal .",
    "they also proved that given the pswitch set @xmath33 , all rational probabilities @xmath34 with @xmath35 can be realized by an ssp circuit with at most @xmath4 pswitches ; given the pswitch set @xmath36 , all rational probabilities @xmath37 with @xmath38 can be realized by an ssp circuit with at most @xmath39 pswitches .",
    "wilhelm and bruck also demonstrated the concept of _ duality _ in sp circuits .",
    "the dual of a single pswitch of probability @xmath40 appearing in series is the corresponding pswitch of probability @xmath41 appearing in parallel .",
    "similarly , the dual of a pswitch of probability @xmath40 appearing in parallel is a pswitch of probability @xmath41 appearing in series .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig_duality ] , the circuit in ( b ) is the dual of the circuit in ( a ) , and vice versa .",
    "it can be proved that dual circuits satisfy the following relation :    for a stochastic series - parallel circuit @xmath8 and its dual @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 where @xmath10 is the probability of circuit @xmath8 and @xmath44 is the probability of circuit @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the robustness of different kinds of stochastic switching circuits , where the probabilities of individual pswitches are taken from a fixed pswitch set , but given an error allowance of @xmath0 ; i.e. , the error probabilities of the pswitches are bounded by @xmath0 . for a stochastic circuit with multiple pswitches ,",
    "the _ error probability _ of the circuit is the absolute difference between the probability that the circuit is closed when error probabilities of pswitches are included , and the probability that the circuit is closed when error probabilities are omitted .",
    "we show that ssp circuits are robust to small error perturbations , but the error probability of a general sp circuit may be amplified with additional pswitches .      here , we analyze the susceptibility of ssp circuits to small error perturbations in individual pswitches . based on our assumption , instead of assigning a pswitch a probability of @xmath40 , the pswitch",
    "may be assigned a probability between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath0 is a fixed error allowance .    given a pswitch set s ,",
    "if the error probability of each pswitch is bounded by @xmath0 , then the total error probability of an ssp circuit is bounded by @xmath47    we induct on the number of pswitches .",
    "if we have just one pswitch , the result is trivial .",
    "suppose the result holds for @xmath4 pswitches , and note that for an ssp circuit with @xmath48 pswitches , the last pswitch will either be added in series or in parallel with the first @xmath4 pswitches . by the induction hypothesis ,",
    "the circuit constructed from the first @xmath4 pswitches has probability @xmath49 of being closed , where @xmath50 is the error probability introduced by the first @xmath4 pswitches and @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52st pswitch has probability @xmath53 of being closed , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "if the @xmath52st pswitch is added in series , see fig .",
    "[ fig_robustssp](a ) , then the new circuit ( with errors ) has probability @xmath56 of being closed . without considering the error probability of each pswitch ,",
    "the probability of the new circuit is @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the overall error probability of the circuit is @xmath58 . by the triangle inequality and the induction hypothesis , @xmath59 completing the induction .",
    "similarly , if the @xmath52st pswitch is added in parallel , see fig .",
    "[ fig_robustssp](b ) , then the new circuit ( with errors ) has probability @xmath60 of being closed . without considering the error probability of each pswitch , the probability that the circuit is closed is @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the overall error probability of the circuit with @xmath48 pswitches is @xmath62 . again using the induction hypothesis and the triangle inequality , we have @xmath63 this completes the proof .",
    "the theorem above implies that ssp circuits are robust to small error perturbations : no matter how big the circuit is , the error probability of an ssp circuit will be well bounded by a constant times @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider a case that @xmath64 . in this case ,",
    "the overall error probability of any ssp circuit is bounded by @xmath65 if each pswitch is given an error allowance of @xmath0 .",
    "we have proved that for a given pswitch set @xmath9 , the overall error probability of an ssp circuit is well bounded .",
    "we want to know whether this property holds for all sp circuits .",
    "unfortunately , we show that as the number of pswitches increases , the overall error probability of an sp circuit may also increase . in this subsection",
    ", we will give the upper bound and lower bound for the error probabilities of sp circuits .",
    "given a pswitch set @xmath9 , if the error probability of each pswitch is @xmath0 ( where @xmath66 ) , then there exists an sp circuit of size @xmath4 with overall error probability @xmath67 .",
