    "lvy statistics applies to the description of a particular class of random walks obeying a ` heavy - tailed ' probability distribution with power law dependence @xcite .",
    "lvy statistics has been studied in great details owing to its importance in numerous scientific areas where such random walks can occur , and where the long tail of lvy distributions is essential for the prediction of rare events , be that in chemistry @xcite , biology @xcite , or in economics @xcite . in physics ,",
    "lvy statistics appears often as a result of a complex dynamics , in various transport processes of heat , sound , or light diffusions , in chaotic systems , and in laser cooling where it has broad applications for sub - recoil cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "it was shown long ago that in a gas the distribution of energy shifts resulting from the van der waals interaction is given by a lvy - type distribution , known as van der waals profile @xcite .",
    "however , lvy statistics has so far not been applied to ensembles of rydberg atoms , typically interacting via pair - wise long - range potentials .",
    "being able to simulate very large systems of interacting rydberg atoms with simple statistics would be very valuable when the size of the hilbert space becomes too large to allow for full quantum simulation .",
    "moreover , a statistical approach to the simulation of the laser excitation of atoms to rydberg state would be significantly faster than other approximate computational techniques such as monte carlo rate equations ( mcre ) sampling @xcite .",
    "most importantly , any approach for simulating the laser excitation must take into account the effect of the interaction blockade @xcite .",
    "the interaction blockade prevents the excitation of pairs of rydberg atoms with internuclear separations shorter than the so - called blockade distance @xmath5 , which may give rise to highly correlated many - body states and tends to favor the excitation of ordered structures @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics of the excitation of atoms highly depends on the shifts of the individual rydberg energy levels . for a given atom @xmath6 and in case of isotropic interactions ,",
    "this shift due to all the surrounding rydberg atoms @xmath7 at @xmath8 distance writes in frequency unit , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the planck constant , and @xmath11 is the interaction strength coefficient .",
    "the most common interaction is of van der waals type with @xmath3 exponent , while another possibility is the resonant dipole - dipole interaction @xmath12 , and in practice both of them can be isotropic for well - chosen experimental conditions . in order to develop a statistical treatment of the laser excitation ,",
    "it is critical to determine the probability distribution @xmath13 of energy level shifts @xmath14 , at a particular location @xmath15 independently chosen from the position of any excited rydberg atoms .",
    "the primary purpose of this article is to show @xmath16 is mostly given by lvy stable distributions , and that lvy statistics is suitable for the description of the dynamics of an interacting rydberg gas . in section",

    "this result is interesting for rydberg atom physics if the bandwidth of the laser excitation is sufficiently large , whereby the blockade distance becomes vanishingly small in comparison to the interatomic distances .",
    "then in subsection [ interactinghardball ] , we simulate @xmath13 in the framework of the hard ball model with random distributions of impenetrable interacting particles of radii @xmath18 , for which the pair - correlation function closely resembles that of the real system @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate with numerical simulations that the distribution @xmath16 remains of lvy stable type to a very good approximation , and confirm this result analytically at the limit of small @xmath5 . in section iii , the actual laser excitation of a cold gas to rydberg state",
