    "here we show , using first principles calculations , that ( i ) the pristine system ( clean bto surface with an ideal tio@xmath2 termination ) does not allow for a ferroelectric polarization , @xmath6 , normal to the surface despite the large compressive strain ; ( ii ) a non - zero @xmath6 is crucially dependent on the presence of a surface external ionic charge , in the form of defects or adsorbates ; and ( iii ) the energetics for the formation of oxidized or reduced surface defects support the electrochemical switching model .",
    "we also find ( iv ) a systematic change in band offset with screening charge density , which we identify as the microscopic mechanism behind the experimentally observed ter  @xcite , and ( v ) a large magnetoelectric coupling , due to the accumulation or depletion of spin - polarized carriers at the interface with ferromagnetic lsmo .",
    "the connection between these effects can be summarized as follows : under open - circuit boundary conditions the electric displacement field @xmath7 within the film , the change in magnetization at the interface @xmath8 and the interface dipole , are all proportional ( or equal ) to the external ionic charge density , @xmath9 per unit surface @xmath10 , produced by the redox processes .",

    "a vanishing @xmath6 is consistent with the open - circuit boundary conditions , despite the large compressive strain . in absence of a top electrode",
    "the macroscopic electric displacement field @xmath7 in bto is equal and opposite to the density of external surface charge .",

    "this process is favored by the energy associated with the biased external circuit , @xmath27 , but costs an energy equal to the change in binding energy of the ion to the ferroelectric surface and to the tip surface , @xmath28 ( this effectively redefines the relevant chemical potential ) . by minimizing the gibbs free energy of the system (",
    "see e.g. ref .   or  ) it can be shown that poling can stabilize redox defects if @xmath29 , after which the equilibrium redox charge density , @xmath21 , and polarization both grow with @xmath30 .",
    "this electrochemical process would then act as a nanobattery , rather than a nanocapacitor . by controlling the environment ( species and chemical potential ) and @xmath30 , one may be also able to selectively control the active redox reaction , potentially opening new routes to surface redox catalysis .",
    "after removal of the tip , the surface redox density from poling can remain , since the reverse reaction is now blocked by key reactants being removed with the tip .",
    "this would explain the observation of ref .   that the domains are stable for a very long time after `` writing ''",
    "of course , lateral charge diffusion across domain boundaries  @xcite may still occur in principle , but kinetic barriers are likely to hinder such processes .",

    "this work opens several avenues for future research . from the experimental point of view",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate the composition of a ferroelectric surface before and after switching ( e.g. via the afm tip ) , to verify whether reduced or oxidized gas - phase species are present ( as suggested by our results ) .",

    ", a natural next step would be to perform a more detailed thermodynamic analysis of the stability of a ferroelectric surface ( either pristine or decorated with adsorbates ) .",

    "as discussed in the main text , the electric displacement and polarization within bto , @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and hence the valence band offset , @xmath44 , depend only on @xmath21 , the surface defect charge density , and not the surface chemistry .",

    ", this is not strictly the case once @xmath44 becomes negative or reaches the band gap of bto . at this point electrons or holes  spill out \" in to the bto layer . this ",
    "charge spill out \" regime is favored by dft , which often underestimates the band gap , and therefore can be an artifact of the calculation .                                    in our case , due to the presence of a free surface , there is a further issue that was not explicitly considered in ref .",
    "35 , i.e. the effect of surface states . in many cases",
    ", these fall within the bulk band gap of the ferroelectric film , and might cross the fermi level of the metal , thus causing a significant spill - out of charge even when the bulk electronic bands are not directly affected .",
    "note that surface states in ferroelectrics typically have a marked localized orbital character ( either the atomic orbital of an adsorbate , or the 3@xmath25 orbitals of the transition metal cation ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suspect that dft might introduce systematic errors in their ionization energies ( similarly to the energy location of the bulk band edges discussed in ref .",

    "the pristine one is unaffected , the negatively polarized ( o - vac and 2h ) systems are affected by electron spill out into the conduction band , and the two positively polarized ( o - ads and 2oh ) ones are affected by hole spill out into surface states ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "in both o - vac and 2h @xmath45 amounts to approximately 0.03 electrons per unit cell of bto , which is a fairly mild effect ( compare with approximately 0.15 electrons per unit cell in the kno / sro system of ref .  ) . in the case of o - ads and 2oh ,",
    "the surface o(2@xmath46 ) states accommodate a total of approximately 0.1 holes per surface perovskite unit ( fig .",
    "5(f ) ) . of course , estimating to what degree this charge spill is problematic , depends not only on the magnitude but also the purpose of the calculation .",
    "the charge spill out induces an error in two quantities that are discussed in this work : the total injected charge into the lsmo electrode , and the band alignment .",
    "considering the total injected charge , the impact of this error is trivial to estimate .",
    "in fact , 0.03 electrons per cell times @xmath47 , number of bto cells , corresponds exactly to the difference between the actual induced spin in lsmo and the  ideal \" limit of 2 bohr magnetons per cell .",
    "this observation can be directly used to estimate the error in the calculated band offset .",
    "in fact , we can assume in a first approximation that the band offset is linear in the electric displacement of the bto cell adjacent to the interface , @xmath48 .",
    "using the above numbers for the o - vac system , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the induced spin , and @xmath10 is the supercell surface area ( or reciprocal of the defect density ) .",
    "this provides an accurate estimate of the actual electric displacement  felt \" by lsmo . using this information , therefore",
    ", we can make a very accurate estimation of the linear band offset dependence with @xmath7 .",
    "we used this analysis to make the plot shown in fig .",
