    "two - time quantities , such as the autocorrelation function @xmath2 and the associated linear response function @xmath3 , describing the effects of a perturbation , are generally considered in experiments , theories and numerical investigations . in equilibrium",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) holds , providing an important tool to study coherence lengths and relaxation times by means of susceptibility measurements .    beside equilibrium",
    ", the pair @xmath4 and @xmath5 has been thoroughly investigated also in slowly relaxing systems , among which supercooled liquids , glasses , spin - glasses and quenched ferromagnets , as natural quantities to characterize and study the aging behavior . in this context , the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath6 was defined  @xcite in order to quantify the _ distance _ from equilibrium , where @xmath7 . particularly relevant is its limiting value @xmath8 due to its robust universal properties  @xcite .",
    "complementary to @xmath9 , the concept of an effective temperature @xmath10 , has been thoroughly applied in several contexts  @xcite , although its physical meaning has not yet been completely clarified .",
    "moreover , the fluctuation - dissipation ratio was also proved  @xcite to be related to the overlap probability distribution of the equilibrium state at the final temperature of the quench , providing an important bridge between equilibrium and non - equilibrium .",
    "finally , in the context of coarsening systems , the behavior of the response function was shown to be strictly linked to geometric properties of the interfaces  @xcite , allowing the characterization of their roughness , and , in the case of phase - ordering on inhomogeneous substrates , to important topological properties of the underlying graph  @xcite .",
    "besides this manifold interest in average two - time quantities , more recently considerable attention has been paid also to the study of their local fluctuations , which are now accessible in large - scale numerical simulations  @xcite and , due to new techniques , also in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for considering these quantities are various :    - in disordered systems , since averaging over the disorder makes the usual two - particle correlation function ( structure factor ) short ranged even in those cases where a large coherence length @xmath11 is present , quantities related either to the spatial fluctuations of @xmath4  @xcite or to non - linear susceptibilities   have been proposed to detect and quantify @xmath11 .",
    "- local fluctuations of two - time quantities are associated with the dynamical heterogeneities observed in several systems which are believed to be a key for local rearrangements taking place in slowly evolving systems  @xcite . in the context of spin models , it was shown  @xcite that these fluctuations can be conveniently used to highlight the heterogeneous nature of the system .    - in  @xcite it was shown that in a large class of glassy models the action describing the asymptotic dynamics is invariant under the transformation of time @xmath12 , denoted as time re - parametrization .",
    "this symmetry is expected to hold true in glassy systems with a finite effective temperature but not in coarsening systems , where @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "then , restricting to glassy systems , it was proposed  @xcite that the aging kinetics could be physically interpreted as the coexistence of different parametrization @xmath14 slowly varying in space @xmath15 . according to this interpretation , spatial fluctuations of two - time quantities should span the possible values of @xmath4 and @xmath16 associated to different choices of @xmath17 .",
    "since the correlation and the response function transform in the same way under the time - re - parametrization transformation , the same curve @xmath18 relating the average quantities is expected to hold also for the fluctuations .",
    "this property was proposed in  @xcite as a check on the time - re - parametrization invariance , and the results tend to conform to this interpretation .    - in  @xcite it was claimed that , at least in the context of non - disordered coarsening systems , fluctuations of two - time quantities encode the limiting fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath19 , similarly to the fluctuation - dissipation relation between the fully averaged quantities @xmath5 and @xmath20 .    in the first part of this paper ,",
    "we discuss the definition of the fluctuating versions @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 on site @xmath24 , and consider their ( co-)variances @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( defined analogously to @xmath28 ) .",
    "we present a rather detailed and complete study of these quantities and their relation with a non - linear susceptibility @xmath29 ( defined in eq .",
    "[ chi2r2 ] ) related to the fluctuations of @xmath30 introduced in  .",
    "we show that , for @xmath31 , the variance @xmath32 of @xmath30 is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "this allows us to derive a relation between @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 , which can be regarded as a second order fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( sofdt ) relating these quantities in equilibrium .",
    "the sofdt holds for every choice of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and of @xmath38 and is completely general for markov systems .",
    "it represents also a relation between the second moments of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath31 , but not for @xmath41 because , in this case , @xmath33 can not be straightforwardly interpreted as a variance .",
    "prompted by the sofdt , we argue that @xmath33 , rather than @xmath32 , is the natural quantity to be considered , on an equal footing with the variances @xmath34 and @xmath35 , to study scaling behaviors , and to detect and quantify correlation lengths .",
    "being a susceptibility , @xmath42 could in principle be accessible in experiments .",
    "these ideas are tested in the second part of the paper , where we study numerically the behavior of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and of @xmath33 in non - disordered ferromagnets in equilibrium or in the non - equilibrium kinetics following a quench to a final temperature @xmath43 at or below @xmath44 . restricting to the cases with @xmath45",
    "the same problem has been recently addressed analytically by annibale and sollich  @xcite in the context of the soluble spherical model . here",
    "we carry out the analysis in the finite - dimensional ising model , focusing particularly on the scaling properties .",
    "focusing on the @xmath46 fourier component @xmath47 ( and similarly for the other quantities ) our results show a pattern of behaviors for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 similar to what is known for @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in particular , in a quench at @xmath44 ,",
    "one finds the asymptotic scaling form @xmath51 , where the exponent @xmath52 can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium static and dynamic critical exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in agreement with what was found in  @xcite . in quenches below @xmath44 , in the time sector with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , usually referred to as aging regime , we find a scaling form @xmath57 ( and similarly for @xmath49 and @xmath58 ) , where , in contrast to the critical quench , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are genuinely non - equilibrium quantities that can not be straightforwardly related to equilibrium behaviors .",
    "our results allow us to discuss also the issue of a direct correlation between the fluctuating parts of @xmath4 and @xmath16 , as predicted for glassy systems by the time - re - parametrization invariance scenario . in the aging dynamics of coarsening systems",
    ", we find that for large @xmath61 the ratio @xmath62 diverges , both in the quench at @xmath44 and below @xmath44 .",
