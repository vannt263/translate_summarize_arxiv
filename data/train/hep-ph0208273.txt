    "a large number of independent astronomical observations ( on galactic halos , clusters of galaxies , large scale structures ) indicate that in our universe the average density of matter , normalized to the critical density @xmath0 ( _ h _ is the hubble constant in units of 100 km @xmath1 ) , is in the range @xmath2 ( or equivalently , @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath4 may also be derived by combining cmb measurements @xcite with data on high - redshift snia @xcite , with the further result that a large value , @xmath5 , should be assigned to the cosmological - constant ( or quintessence ) contribution .    by comparing these results on @xmath6 with the contribution to matter provided by visible matter , @xmath7 , and with the amount of baryonic matter , as deduced from primordial nucleosynthesis , @xmath8 @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that : i ) most of the matter in the universe is dark , ii ) only a small fraction of it is baryonic .",
    "particle physics offers a large selection of possible candidates for dark matter , once one considers extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the most obvious option is represented by massive neutrinos , as suggested by oscillation effects observed in solar and atmospheric neutrinos ( for the latest data , see ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite , respectively ) . in these experiments only differences in neutrino squared masses are measured ; from these results and from the standard formula @xmath9 a lower bound may be established for neutrino contribution to the cosmological matter density , @xmath10 . obviously , the cosmological neutrino contribution may be larger , in case of neutrino mass degeneracy .",
    "however , taking into account the stringent upper bound , @xmath11 ev , derived from tritium beta decay @xcite , an upper limit on the neutrino cosmological contribution may be derived : @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 , using the central value @xmath14 ) .",
    "the existence of an upper bound of roughly this order of magnitude for the neutrino contribution to the matter density in the universe is not unexpected , since the evolution theory of the primordial density fluctuations into the present cosmological structures indicates that most of the dark matter must be comprised of cold particles , _ i. e. _ of particles that decoupled from the primordial plasma when nonrelativistic",
    ". massive neutrinos , with masses up to about 1 mev , are relativistic at decoupling , and then , by their free streaming , tend to erase small  scale structures . a recent investigation @xcite , based on the largest galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , has derived the upper bound @xmath15 .    thus , by using particle physics results and cosmological observations , one arrives at the conclusion that light neutrinos are expected to only constitute a subdominant dark matter component .",
    "we turn now to cold relics .",
    "the order of magnitude of the relic abundance of these cold particles , or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particle ) , is set by the approximate formula @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the thermal average of the product of the annihilation cross - section @xmath18 times the relative velocity @xmath19 for a pair of wimps , integrated from the freeze  out temperature @xmath20 to the present  day one @xcite .    as mentioned above , to identify a wimp with a specific particle candidate",
    ", one has to move beyond the standard model . the only guidance in the selection of a specific model is provided by theoretical motivations .",
    "indeed , from measurements at accelerators and in other precision experiments no significant evidence of physics beyond the sm emerged so far ; thus we can only count on bounds , which significantly constrain the amount of acceptable deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "one of the most strongly motivated extension of the standard model is represented by supersymmetry .",
    "this is the theoretical framework within which we consider here possible candidates for dark matter .",
    "supersymmetric relics are interesting because of the following properties : i ) if r  parity is conserved , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable ; ii ) if colourless and uncharged , the lsp is a nice realization of a relic wimp @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we assume that supersymmetry exists in nature and that properties ( i ) and ( ii ) hold .",
    "the nature of the lsp depends on the susy  breaking mechanism and on the specific regions of the susy parameter space considered . here",
    "we limit ourselves to gravity ",
    "mediated schemes , and domains of the parameter space where the lsp is the neutralino .",
    "the neutralino is defined as the lowest ",
    "mass linear superposition of photino ( @xmath21 ) , zino ( @xmath22 ) and the two higgsino states ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter , the nature of the neutralino is classified in terms of a parameter @xmath26 , defined as @xmath27 .",
    "the neutralino is called a gaugino when @xmath28 , a higgsino when @xmath29 , mixed otherwise .    extensive calculations on relic neutralino phenomenology in gravity",
    " mediated models have been performed ( among the most recent references on neutralino dark matter see , for instance , @xcite ) .    even limiting oneself to a the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , a significant variety of different schemes exists , from those based on universal or non - universal supergravity , with susy parameters defined at the grand unification scale ( gut ) , to an effective supersymmetric model defined at the electro",
    " weak ( ew ) scale .",
    "the mssm is described by a yang ",
    "mills lagrangian , by the superpotential , which contains all the yukawa interactions between the standard and supersymmetric fields , and by the soft  breaking lagrangian , which models the breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "the yukawa interactions are described by the parameters @xmath30 , which are related to the masses of the standard fermions by the usual expressions , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the @xmath34 s of the two higgs fields , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "implementation of this model within a supergravity scheme leads naturally to a set of unification assumptions at a grand unification ( gut ) scale ,",
    "@xmath37 : i ) unification of the gaugino masses : @xmath38 , ii ) universality of the scalar masses with a common mass denoted by @xmath39 : @xmath40 , iii ) universality of the trilinear scalar couplings : @xmath41 .",
    "the relevant parameters of the model at the electro  weak ( ew ) scale are obtained from their corresponding values at the @xmath37 scale by running these down according to the renormalization group equations ( rge ) . by requiring that the electroweak symmetry breaking is induced radiatively by the soft supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "one finally reduces the model parameters to five : @xmath42 and sign @xmath43 . in this very strict scheme ( universal sugra )",
    "the phenomenology of relic neutralinos is very sensitive to the way in which various constraints ( for instance those on the bottom quark mass , @xmath44 , on the top quark mass , @xmath45 , and on the strong coupling @xmath46 ) are implemented .",
    "models with unification conditions at the gut scale represent an appealing scenario ; however , some of the assumptions listed above , particularly ii ) and iii ) , are not very solid , because , as was already emphasized some time ago @xcite , universality might occur at a scale higher than @xmath47 gev , _ e.g. _ , at the planck scale .    to take into account the uncertainty in the unification scale one may introduce deviations in the unification conditions at @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , deviations from universality in the scalar masses at @xmath37 , which split @xmath48 from @xmath49 may be parametrized as @xmath50 .",
    "this is the case of non  universal sugra ( nusugra ) that we considered in refs .",
    "further extensions of deviations from universality in sugra models which include squark and/or gaugino masses are discussed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the initial scale for the rge running , @xmath51 , might be smaller than @xmath47 gev has been raised , on the basis of a number of string models ( see , for instance , @xcite and references quoted therein ) . as is stressed in ref.@xcite",
    ", @xmath51 might be anywhere between the ew scale and the planck scale , with significant consequences for neutralino phenomenology , _",
    "e. g. _ for the size of the neutralino ",
    "nucleon cross section .      in view of the large uncertainties involved in the choice of the scale @xmath51",
    ", the sugra schemes turn out to be somewhat problematic : the originally appealing feature of a universal sugra with few parameters fails , because of the need to take into consideration the variability of @xmath51 or , alternatively , to add new parameters which quantify the various effects of deviation from universality at the gut scale .",
    "thus , it appears more convenient to work with a phenomenological susy model whose parameters are defined directly at the electroweak scale . here",
    ", this effective scheme of mssm is denoted as effmssm .",
    "it provides , at the ew scale , a model , defined in terms of a minimum number of parameters : only those necessary to shape the essentials of the theoretical structure of mssm , and of its particle content .",
    "once all experimental and theoretical constraints are implemented in this effmssm model , one may investigate its compatibility with specific theoretical schemes at the desired @xmath51 .",
    "in the effmssm scheme we consider here , we impose a set of assumptions at the electroweak scale : a ) all trilinear parameters are set to zero except those of the third family , which are unified to a common value @xmath52 ; b ) all squark soft  mass parameters are taken degenerate : @xmath53 ; c ) all slepton soft  mass parameters are taken degenerate : @xmath54 ; d ) the @xmath55 and @xmath56 gaugino masses , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are assumed to be linked by the usual relation @xmath59 ( this is the only gut ",
    "induced relation we are using , since gaugino mass unification appears to be better motivated than scalar masses universality ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the supersymmetric parameter space consists of seven independent parameters .",
    "we choose them to be : @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the mass of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson ) .",
    "much larger extensions of the supersymmetric models could be envisaged : for instance , non  unification of the gaugino masses @xcite , and schemes with cp  violating phases @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we only report results obtained in the framkework of the effmssm . for a comparison with results derived in other susy schemes see ref.@xcite .      in our exploration of the susy parameter space",
    ", we have implemented the following experimental constraints : accelerators data on supersymmetric and higgs boson searches ( cern @xmath62 collider lep2 @xcite and collider detector cdf at fermilab @xcite ) ; measurements of the @xmath63 decay @xcite .",
    "a further constraint is supplied by the bounds on the supersymmetric contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath64 .",
    "the muon ( g-2 ) collaboration at brookhaven national laboratory has recently reported a new experimental determination of @xmath65 @xcite ; this confirms their previous measurement @xcite with a precision increased by a factor of two .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical evaluation of the sm contribution to @xmath66 , @xmath67 , is affected by an error which is about twice the present experimental uncertainty .",
    "if we use for the leading hadronic contribution the average of the evaluations in refs.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) , for higher order corrections the results of refs.@xcite and for the hadronic light  by  light contribution the average of the results of refs.@xcite , we find that @xmath67 deviates from @xmath68 @xcite only by a mere 1.4@xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _ that @xmath70 sits in the rounded  off 2@xmath69 range : @xmath71 . in the present paper",
    "we restrain @xmath64 to stay inside this range .",
    "parenthetically , we note that @xmath72 would rise to a 2.6@xmath69 level , if for the leading hadronic contribution one arbitrarily uses only the results of ref.@xcite and disregards those of refs.@xcite .",
    "relic neutralinos may produce many different effects , generated either by their interactions with ordinary matter or by their pair  annihilations .",
    "these effects may be detected in experiments designed to search for wimps , either directly or indirectly .",
    "direct detection aims at the measurement of the energy released by a wimp to a target nucleus as a consequence of their mutual interaction @xcite .",
    "the detection rate is proportional to the wimp  nucleus cross  section convoluted over the phase",
    " space distribution function of the wimps in the galactic halo , calculated at the solar  system neighbourhood .",
    "as is customary , we assume that this distribution function may be written as the product of a matter density @xmath73 times a velocity distribution funcion @xmath74 .",
    "once a specific @xmath74 is chosen , measurements of the detection rate in direct wimp experiments provide information on the product of @xmath73 times the wimp  nucleus cross  section , or on the product @xmath75 , when coherent interactions dominate over spin  dependent ones ( @xmath76 denotes the wimp  nucleon scalar cross  section ) @xcite .",
    "we further express @xmath73 as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the local _ total _ dark matter density and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) is a scaling parameter which accounts for the actual fraction of local dark matter to be ascribed to the candidate @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in the case of wimps with coherent interactions with matter , the range of wimp parameters under current exploration in wimp direct searches may approximately be given as : @xmath82 for wimp masses @xmath83 in the range : @xmath84 in deriving the ranges in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sens][eq : mass ] ) , a variety of wimp galactic distribution functions and uncertainties in astrophysical quantities have been taken into account @xcite . when interpreted as due to a wimp with coherent interactions , the dama annual ",
    "modulation effect @xcite provides a @xmath85 region in the plane @xmath86 which is embedded in the range of eqs.([eq : sens][eq : mass ] ) .",
    "other experiments of wimp direct detection provide upper bounds on @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that a comparison of results derived from experiments using different target nuclei is only feasible under the assumption that the wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction is dominantly coherent ; otherwise , the comparison is either impossible or strongly model  dependent .",
    "interpretation of the dama annual ",
    "modulation results in terms of a wimp with a mixed ( coherent and spin dependent ) coupling is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "indirect signals may be produced by :    \\a ) annihilation of neutralinos inside celestial bodies ( earth and sun ) , where @xmath81 s have been captured and accumulated . among the various annihilation products ,",
    "neutrinos would be able to emerge form the celestial bodies and be detectable as up  going muons in neutrino telescopes .",
    "\\b ) neutralino  neutralino annihilations taking place in the galactic halo .",
    "specific signals would emerge : most notably , neutrino fluxes , photon fluxes , and rare components in cosmic rays ( positrons , antiprotons , antideuterons ) .    in case of signals of category",
    "( a ) the detection rate is , as in the case of direct detection , proportional to the product @xmath88 ( assuming that coherent interactions dominate over spin  dependent ones ) ; for signals of category ( b ) , the detection rates are proportional to the product @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the average of @xmath91 over the galactic halo .",
    "this makes the size of signals of type ( b ) very sensitive to effects of clumpiness in spatial distribution of wimps @xcite .",
    "actually , recent high  resolution simulations of cosmic structures appear to favour formation of regions of matter overdensity inside galaxies @xcite , with important implications for neutralino signals ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    one may wonder whether constraints on neutralinos could be derived from some other indirect means , not related to specific experiments designed to search for wimps .",
    "for instance , it has been argued that significant constraints could be deduced from helioseismology or from data on solar neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "however , it has been subsequently proved that no constraints can be derived at present from solar physics for wimps with masses above 30 gev @xcite .",
    "[ t ]      a first important question is whether present sensitivities in wimp direct and indirect experiments are enough to explore some parts of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "furthermore , one wonders whether the relevant neutralinos provide a significant contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "these two questions are connected , since @xmath92 and @xmath76 ( and consequently also the neutralino direct detection rate ) are approximately anticorrelated @xcite .",
    "fig.1 provides an answer to the above questions .",
    "first , it shows that present experiments of wimp direct search actually explore significant regions of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "this property was already pointed out in ref.@xcite ; actually , in the mid  nineties , with the advent of new detectors , wimp direct searches acquired the capability of exploring regions of the susy parameter space not yet excluded by accelerator bounds . since then",
    ", the progressively more stringent limits established by new accelerator data have been counterbalanced by the improved sensitivities of wimp direct experiments @xcite . for analyses by other groups",
    "see for instance refs.@xcite .",
    "secondly , fig.1 shows that exploration by wimp direct search is effective also in sectors where relic neutralinos may provide a substantial contribution to @xmath6 . in view of the anticorrelation between @xmath93 and @xmath76 ,",
    "this property is far from being trivial .    however , also",
    "the case of relic neutralinos which only constitute a subdominant dark matter population are interesting in view of their explorability by wimp direct experiments @xcite . to further illustrate this point , in fig.2 we display a scatter plot of the susy configurations which belong to the value @xmath94/(0.3 gev @xmath95 ) @xmath96_{expt } = 1 \\cdot 10^{-9}$ ] nbarn , which is representative of a value of @xmath97 inside the experimental sensitivity range of eq.([eq : sens ] ) , and to the mass interval of eq.([eq : mass ] ) .",
    "the plot is obtained in the following way : 1 ) @xmath73 is evaluated as @xmath98_{expt}$ ] / @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is calculated within the susy model ) , 2 ) to each value of @xmath73 one associates the corresponding calculated value of @xmath93 . for a full discussion of the various sectors displayed in fig.2 we refer to @xcite . here",
    "we wish to call the attention only to two of these sectors .",
    "the most interesting one is obviously the rectangular ( cross - hatched ) region , where 0.2 gev @xmath101 1.7 gev @xmath95 @xcite and @xmath102 ; this corresponds to a situation where the neutralino may be a dominant dark matter component .",
    "a second interesting region is the band delimited by the slanted dot  dashed lines and simply  hatched in the figure . for configurations which fall inside this band , the neutralino would provide only a fraction of the cold dark matter , at the level of local density and of the average relic abundance ; a situation which would be possible , for instance , if the neutralino is not the unique cold dark matter particle component .",
    "to neutralinos belonging to these configurations one should assign a _ rescaled _ local density .",
    "our results prove that also these relic neutralinos are actually probed by wimp direct searches .",
    "we turn now to indirect wimp searches .",
    "it may be shown that also measurements of up  going muons at neutrino telescopes @xcite might be capable of exploring interesting neutralino configurations @xcite , with some overlap with those analysed in wimp direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "fig.3 displays the scatter plot for the up - going muon flux from the center of the earth , evaluated in effmssm , for a standard galactic distribution function and taking into account the effect of @xmath103 oscillations , for neutrino mass and mixing angle parameters which best fit the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .",
    "a number of susy configurations are at the level of current experimental bounds .",
    "however , one should be aware of the fact that the efficiency of capture of wimps by the earth , and then also the up - going muon flux from the center of the earth , are very sensitive to the modifications induced by the sun on the local low - energy wimp population .",
    "depending on the damour - krauss conjecture @xcite or the gould - alam conjecture @xcite , the up - going muon flux from the center of the earth might be either enhanced or suppressed , as compared to the standard one .",
    "therefore , at present , derivations of constraints on supersymmetric configurations from experimental bounds on up - going muon flux from the center of the earth is very hazardous . this important point",
    "is often disregarded in the literature .",
    "very promising are also strategies for measuring in space signals due to neutralino pair ",
    "annihilations taking place in the halo . here",
    "we briefly mention only some signals consisting of rare components in cosmic rays .",
    "one of the most widely discussed case is a possible primary flux of low - energy antiprotons",
    ". calculations of secondary antiprotons , due to interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar material , have greatly improved in recent years @xcite and have shown that at low - energy ( antiproton kinetic energy @xmath104 less then about 1 gev ) the secondary spectrum is much flatter than previously believed and fits remarkably well the experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore , only tiny room is left to exotic components , and the discrimination between secondary and primary components becomes very problematic .",
    "however , since a number of supersymmetric configurations reach or even exceed the level of the experimental spectrum @xcite , high statistics in @xmath105 measurements and great accuracy in the evaluation of the primary and secondary spectra may provide useful constraints for supersymmetry .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that a measurement of low  energy antideuterons in space would provide a way of looking at a distinctive signature of wimp pair annihilation in the halo @xcite .",
    "in fact at energies below about 1 gev per nucleon the primary spectrum would be quite dominant over the secondary one ( see fig .",
    "this property is at variance with what happens in case of the antiproton low  energy spectra .",
    "thus , the antideuteron measurements open up quite new interesting perspectives for detecting @xmath106 annihilation in space .",
    "we wish also to mention that the heat collaboration @xcite reported evidence for an excess of positrons in cosmic rays at energies around 10 gev .",
    "this might be considered as due to neutralino ",
    "neutralino annihilation ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that this interpretation requires an _ ad hoc _",
    "boost factor in order to fit the experimental data .",
