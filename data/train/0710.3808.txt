    "the initial baseline design for the advanced ligo gravitational wave detectors @xcite employs gaussian beams in the arm cavities .",
    "the leading noise source in the most sensitive frequency band of the instruments ( @xmath9 hz ) is the thermal noise in the substrate and reflective coating of the mirror test masses .",
    "lowering thermal noise is therefore of paramount importance for achieving a higher event rate in ligo .",
    "there are a number of other detectors that are being built or upgraded to similar specifications .",
    "while we will choose to study advanced ligo for definiteness , our general conclusions should be more widely applicable to any interferometeric detector that needs to limit thermal noise .",
    "some of the important parameters that we use are summarized in table [ advligoparams ] .",
    "ligo is a fabry - perot interferometer with four mirrored test masses .",
    "the resonant beams in the cavity measure the position of the test masses , averaging over the mirrored surface , with the average weighted by the power distribution of the beam .",
    "thus , the highly illuminated central area is weighted more than the mirror boundary that is left nearly dark .",
    "one way of decreasing the thermal noise is to flatten the beam so that a larger fraction of the mirror is in use . motivated by this intuitive reasoning , oshaughnessy et .",
    "@xcite proposed the flat topped mesa beams , which were subsequently explored in detail by them and others @xcite .",
    "these beams would lower the thermal noise by a factor of approximately 2.5 compared to the baseline design .",
    "the original mesa beam supported by nearly - flat mexican hat mirrors was found to be susceptible to a tilt instability @xcite .",
    "this triggered the proposal of a mesa beam supported by nearly - concentric mirrors @xcite .",
    "in the same paper , a family of hyperboloidal beams that include all mesa and gaussian beams previously considered was introduced .",
    "mesa is currently the leading alternative beam design for advanced ligo , and is being studied experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we first discuss the formulation of hyperboloidal beams .",
    "the `` nearly - flat '' mesa is created by superposing minimal gaussians with generators uniformly distributed inside a cylinder , and the `` nearly - concentric '' by generators falling inside a cone , and passing through the center of the cavity .",
    "these two choices have the same intensity distribution on the mirrors , but the second has a much smaller susceptibility to tilt instability .",
    "the hyperboloidal beams smoothly interpolate between these two cases by twisting the generators of the minimal gaussians by an angle @xmath0 . after discussing some geometric properties of the beams",
    ", we present a proof that gaussian beams are a special case of the hyperboloidal beams , confirming a conjecture in @xcite .",
    "we then compute the three types of mirror thermal noise for a variety of hyperboloidal beam shapes , using a set of simple scaling laws developed in @xcite that simplify previous work @xcite .",
    "the first is substrate brownian noise , occuring due to mechanical dissipation in the material ; this is the least significant source of thermal noise .",
    "the substrate thermoelastic noise is caused by random thermal expansion .",
    "the coating also has both brownian and thermoelastic noise , but these follow the same scaling laws so we consider them as a single source .",
    "the coating noise is the most severe of the three types for the fused - silica substrates currently planned for advanced ligo .",
    "the substrate thermoelastic noise would dominate in a material like sapphire which has a higher thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "we show that the noises decrease with increasing width of the beam , as expected , and that the hyperboloidal beams have larger noise than the relevant mesa beams .",
    "the constraint on our ability to lower the noise comes from the need to keep the diffraction loss small .",
    "gravitational - wave interferometers must keep a large circulating power in the cavity , and so can not allow significant amounts of light to escape past the edge of the mirrors . the current design constraint used in the most recent papers @xcite is a diffraction loss of 1 part per million ( ppm ) per bounce for 17 cm fused - silica mirrors .",
    "the clipping approximation eq .",
    "indicates that the desired mesa width is approximately @xmath10 cm .",
    "previous work @xcite have shown that the clipping approximation is not accurate for gaussian beams of finite mirrors , and have used fast fourier transform simulations for accurate calculations .",
    "we calculate the diffraction losses accurately from eigenvalues of the cavity propagator using an exponentially convergent code that enables us to study the structure of mesa and other hyperboloidal beams as a function of @xmath1 , mirror radius , and twist angle @xmath0 in detail .",
    "we find that the diffraction loss is not a monotonic function of @xmath1 , but due to finite mirror effects has anomalous local minima where the loss is significantly below what is expected from the clipping approximation .",
    "these minima are observed to become more shallow and eventually disappear as the radius of the mirror is increased . however , for the mirror radii and beam widths relevant for advanced ligo the finite mirror effects are important . we show that they can be used to increase the width of the beam , lowering the noise even further than previous work .    finally , we develop an iteration scheme to redesign the mirror , explicitly accounting for finite mirror effects .",
    "the iterated mirror is altered to match the phasefront of the primary eigenbeam of the finite mirror cavity , reducing the diffraction loss of this mode , thus allowing even larger beam widths to satisfy the diffraction loss constraint .",

    "the mirror consists of a substrate with a coating , and we must consider noises due to fluctuations of both .",

    "brownian noise is due to the coupling of normal modes of vibration by imperfections in the material . as a practical matter , both types of noises in the coating have the same scaling law so they do not have to be considered seperately .",
    "in fact , for the fused silica mirrors now under consideration for advanced ligo , the coating noises are the dominant contribution . however , use of a material like sapphire , with a higher coefficient of thermal expansion , would cause the substrate thermoelastic noise to dominate .",

    "a set of simple scaling laws were derived by lovelace @xcite in parallel with oshaughnessy @xcite that are applicable to beams of arbitrary shape .",

    "the results of @xcite suggest that we can expect corrections of not much more than ten percent to the half - infinite scaling law expressions that we are using .",
    "the idealized picture of a locked cavity is that the mirrors are perfectly aligned and a precise distance from each other .",
    "the beam should leave one mirror , reflect off the other , and when it returns it should be the same shape and exactly in phase .",
    "the beam will have lost some intensity due to diffraction and the finite extent of the mirror . in order to build up a very intense beam with a relatively weak laser",
    ", the beam must reflect very many times .",
    "the loss per half - trip ( from one mirror to the other ) must be below approximately 60 ppm",
    ". the majority of the loss will be due to absorption in the mirror and other factors , not diffraction .",
    "the commonly agreed upon budget for losses due to diffraction is 1 ppm .    in previous work , the clipping approximation is often used to estimate the diffraction loss by calculating the fraction of the intensity of the beam which falls outside the mirror .",

    "this sets the width of the resonance for the cavity @xcite to be about @xmath55 radians .",
    "if any other modes with a small diffraction loss have an argument within this distance of the desired mode , there will be severe problems with locking the cavity . for axisymmetric modes , we find that this is not the case and the arguments of the eigenvalues are well - separated enough that locking with mesa or any of the other beams that we study should be no more difficult than locking the currently proposed mesa",
