    "the lattice 4d fermion - gauge scalar ( @xmath0 ) model with u(1 ) gauge symmetry has at quite strong gauge coupling , @xmath1 , a tricritical point frje95a , frfr95a .",
    "the nature of the continuum limit taken at this point is not known .",
    "when this point ( point e in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) is approached from the phase with spontaneously broken global chiral symmetry and a massive fermion @xmath2 ( nambu phase ) , the mass @xmath3 scales .",
    "the fermion @xmath4 is composed of the fundamental fermion ( @xmath5 ) and scalar ( @xmath6 ) fields and is unconfined .",
    "this raises the hope that a nonperturbatively renormalizable theory with dynamical fermion mass generation might be obtained frje95a .",
    "motivated by this interesting possibility we have started an investigation of the scaling behavior of various observables in the vicinity of the point e. we find that apart from @xmath3 also the mass @xmath7 of a composite scalar boson @xmath8 scales in the vicinity of e. this , as well as some other properties frfr95a make the point distinctly different from the ( nonrenormalizable  algo95 ) nambu  jona - lasinio model found in the strong coupling limit of the @xmath0 model  leshr87a .",
    "this , as well as the experience that tricritical points give rise to the scaling behavior different from that associated with the adjacent critical points  lasa84 , contributes to the hope that the point e might correspond to a renormalizable theory .",
    "as reported in frje96c , in 2d an analogous @xmath9 model seems to belong to the universality class of the 2d gross - neveu model and is thus probably renormalizable .",
    "the action is @xmath10 where @xmath11\\ !    \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\ , a m_0 \\sum_x { \\overline{\\chi}}_x \\chi_x \\ ; , \\label{sch }                   \\\\    s_u    \\hspace{-2mm}&=&\\hspace{-2 mm } \\beta \\ , \\sum_{\\rm p } \\left [ 1 - { \\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits}u_{\\rm p } \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{su }   \\\\    s_\\phi \\hspace{-2mm}&=&\\hspace{-2 mm }",

    "the gauge field link variables @xmath13 are elements of the compact gauge group u(1 ) . the complex scalar field @xmath6 of charge one satisfies the constraint  latexmath:[$|\\phi    infinite ) when the squared bare scalar mass is positive ( negative ) infinite .",
    "the staggered fermion field @xmath5 of charge one leads to the global u(1 ) chiral symmetry of the model in the chiral limit , i.e.  when the bare fermion mass @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "the model is meant in the chiral limit , @xmath17 .",
    "however , numerical simulations require nonvanishing @xmath16 and thus also analytic considerations have to include the bare mass .",
    "we therefore show in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] schematic phase diagram of the model in the @xmath18 space .",
    "it illustrates that the tricritical point e is indeed a point in which three critical lines meet :    * line ne where @xmath3 and goldstone boson mass @xmath19 simultaneously smoothly vanish .",
    "* lines ee@xmath20 and ee@xmath21 with vanishing @xmath7 .",
    "the nambu phase below the ne line at @xmath22 is characterized by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the limit cases are    * @xmath25 : 4d xy model and free fermion field .",
    "* @xmath26 : nambu - jona - lasinio model with bare mass . *",
    "@xmath27 : u(1 ) higgs model without fermions .",
    "* @xmath28 : compact qed with charged fermion field . * @xmath29 : free fermion field .",
    "as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , an approach to the tricritical point requires in principle tuning of three parameters",
    ". obviously also the lattice sizes have to be varied .",
    "but the tricritical points have frequently rather large domains ( angles ) of dominance lasa84 .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to fix @xmath30 , which is our current best estimate of the position of the point e in the @xmath31 direction , and vary only @xmath32 and @xmath33 . even so an investigation of the scaling behavior is a tremendous task .",
    "we can present only some preliminary results obtained for @xmath34 and , rather incomplete , also for @xmath35 , without a proper analytic analysis and in particular without taking into account finite size effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the chiral condensate @xmath36 .",
    "an onset of the genuine chiral phase transition is indicated with decreasing @xmath32 .",
    "the fermion mass @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) behaves similarly .",
    "the transition appears to be smooth , i.e. of 2@xmath37 order , close to @xmath38 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we show the scalar boson mass @xmath7 .",
    "the position of the minimum for each @xmath32 corresponds roughly to the crossection of a continuation to smaller @xmath39 of the nearly horizontal `` wing '' with the @xmath30 plane .",
    "as @xmath32 decreases , the minimum seems to approach the @xmath33 value at which the chiral phase transition at @xmath22 is expected on the basis of figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "thus we are indeed in a close vicinity of the tricritical point .    fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] contains very preliminary results for several @xmath40 ( meson ) masses . for comparison",
    "we show also data for @xmath41",
    ". the goldstone boson mass @xmath19 is small around the transition as expected .",
    "the fact that the @xmath42- and @xmath43- masses cross the @xmath41 line in the vicinity of the phase transition indicates that in the nambu phase these mesons can be interpreted as bound states and that their masses scale similarly to @xmath3 and thus may exist also in the continuum limit .",
    "this is a hint that the spectrum of the underlying continuum theory might be quite complex .",
    "our present results suggest that it is worthwhile to continue the investigation of the tricritical point e. for this purpose the full scaling theory of tricritical points  lasa84 and a finite size scaling theory in their vicinity will have to be applied .",
    "some analytic insight into the properties of the model in the relevant coupling region is highly desirable ."
