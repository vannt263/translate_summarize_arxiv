    "laser sideband cooling allows to cool single , strongly - confined atomic particles to very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "its discovery opened the way for experiments , which test the foundations of quantum physics and have applications ranging from quantum metrology to quantum computing @xcite .",
    "moreover , motivated by the imminent quantum technological applications of ultra - cold many - body systems , quantum thermodynamics recently became a very active area of research @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , applying laser cooling to large ensembles of particles or more complex species , like molecules , is still not straightforward .",
    "for example , the most efficient technique to cool atomic gases to the low temperatures required for bose einstein condensation is evaporative cooling , which involves the removal of a significant percentage of particles from the trap .",
    "alternative cooling techniques with the potential of overcoming this problem therefore receive a lot of attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "for example , it is hoped that cavity - mediated laser - cooling will enable us to cool large samples of atomic particles collectively and non - destructively to very low temperatures .",
    "first indications that this might indeed be the case were found in paris already in 1995 @xcite .",
    "more systematic experimental studies of cavity - mediated laser cooling have subsequently been reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "although all of these experiments have their respective merits , they are essentially analogous to laser - cooling without optical cavities and do not provide a much more efficient cooling process for many particles .",
    "the theory of cavity - mediated laser cooling of free particles was first discussed by mossberg _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and zaugg _ et al . _",
    "later , ritsch and collaborators @xcite and others @xcite developed semiclassical theories to model cavity - mediated cooling processes . in 1993 , cirac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a master equation approach to analyse cavity - mediated laser - cooling in more detail .",
    "since the precision of calculations which are based on master equations is easier to control than the precision of semiclassical approximations , this approach has subsequently been used by many authors to emphasize a close analogy between laser - sideband and cavity - mediated laser - cooling of atomic particles @xcite .",
    "+    recently , mishina showed that the cooling dynamics of particles can be affected by trap inhomogeneities @xcite . in this paper , we adopt an alternative but conceptually related approach to cool a non - interacting atomic gas inside an optical cavity . instead of considering a harmonic trap",
    ", we place the particles into an _",
    "asymmetric _ trapping potential and allow them to evolve freely between laser interactions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ timeline ] .",
    "the proposed cooling process is qualitatively different from other laser cooling techniques .",
    "for example , it consists of two stages : a displacement stage and a cooling stage . in the following",
    "we show that alternating both stages transfers the atoms to very low temperatures . for previous laser - cooling schemes @xcite ,",
    "the final energy of the atoms is independent of the number @xmath0 of particles inside the trap .",
    "in contrast to this , we predict a final mean phonon number which vanishes in the many - particle limit .",
    "the main purpose of each displacement stage is to move the atoms away from the centre of their asymmetric trapping potential . during this stage ,",
    "the atoms do not experience any laser cooling and there is nothing quantum about their dynamics .",
    "the hotter the atoms are , the further away they accumulate from the centre of the trap .",
    "the mean phonon number @xmath1 per particle remains essentially the same during this process .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the result of the displacement is the build up of a certain non - zero phonon coherence @xmath2 , if there is more than one particle in the trap .",
    "this non - zero expectation value induces a collective dynamics of the atomic gas during subsequent cooling stages .",
    "+    during each cooling stage , a cooling laser is applied , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the frequency of this laser should coincide with the atomic transition frequency @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the cavity frequency @xmath4 should differ from the atomic transition frequency by a detuning @xmath5 , @xmath6 which ideally coincides with the phonon frequency @xmath7 of the trapped particles .",
    "consequently , the simultaneous de - excitation of an atom and creation of a cavity photon are very likely accompanied by the loss of a phonon . once the cavity photon leaks out of the resonator",
    ", the phonon is permanently lost from the system , which implies cooling . at the same time",
    ", the creation of a cavity photon can be accompanied by the off - resonant creation of a phonon .",
    "this process results in an increase of the mean vibrational energy of the atoms , i.e.  heating @xcite . for most cavity - mediated laser cooling schemes , it is the ratio between the cooling and the heating rates of these two processes , which determines the final temperature of the atomic gas .",
    "any attempts to collectively increase the cooling rate usually also results in a collective enhancement of the respective heating rate . as a result",
    ", cooling might be overall faster but the final vibrational energy per particle remains the same @xcite .",
    "the collectively - enhanced cooling process , which we propose in this paper , uses an alternative cooling mechanism .",
    "as we shall see below , this mechanism changes the vibrational energy of the trapped particles on a much shorter time scale than the heating and cooling transitions described in the previous paragraph .",
    "important for our cooling scheme to work is that the centre of the asymmetric trapping potential coincides with a node of the resonator field ( c.f .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "when this applies , atoms at the centre of the trap do not interact with the cavity field .",
    "moreover , the atom - cavity interaction strength increases , when the atomic distance from the trap centre increases .",
    "being further away from the centre also coincides with the respective atom having a higher temperature .",
    "hence the cooling laser affects hotter atoms much more strongly than cooler ones .",
    "hotter atoms are cooled , while the vibrational energy of already cooler particles remains essentially the same . as a result ,",
    "the atoms move rapidly towards the centre of the trap , while loosing vibrational energy in the process .",
    "the centre of the trapping potential is a fixed point of the atomic dynamics .",
    "once there , the atoms no longer interact with the cavity field .",
    "re - initiating the cooling process requires another displacement stage , which moves the atoms again away from the centre of the trap .    as we shall see below , alternating displacement and cooling stages , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ timeline ] , allows us to cool an atomic gas to very low temperatures .",
    "the proposed cooling process only stops , when the particles are so cold that their positions no longer change significantly during a displacement stage .",
    "consequently the cooling laser no longer affects their motion in the above described manner . compared to other cavity - mediated laser cooling schemes ,",
    "only the dominating cooling mechanism is collectively enhanced .",
    "there is no collectively - enhanced heating mechanism at work .",
    "the final mean phonon number @xmath1 per particle therefore scales favourably with the number of trapped particles , instead of being independent of @xmath0 . for previous cavity - mediated laser - cooling schemes ( c.f .",
    "e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the final energy of the atoms is independent of the number @xmath0 of particles inside the trap .",
    "in contrast to this , we predict a final mean phonon number @xmath1 per particle , which scales as @xmath8 and tends to zero in the many - particle limit .",
    "there are five sections in this paper .",
    "section [ theory ] introduces the theoretical formalism used throughout the remainder of the paper . in section",
    "[ analysis ] , we then use the previously introduced hamiltonians and a master equation to analyse the proposed cooling process .",
    "we derive effective rate equations for the time evolution of the mean phonon expectation values @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section",
    "[ estimate ] , we eventually predict the general scaling of the final mean phonon number @xmath1 of the proposed cavity - mediated laser cooling scheme .",
    "finally we summarise our findings in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "more mathematical details are confined to [ appa ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the theoretical models for the description of the dynamics of the atomic gas throughout the proposed cooling process .",
    "as mentioned already above , the cooling laser is turned off during the displacement stage .",
    "therefore only the hamiltonian for the motional degrees of freedom of the non - interacting atomic particles has to be taken into account , when analysing this stage . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume in the following that an external trap confines the motion of the atoms in the direction of the cavity axis .",
    "hence the hamiltonian for the vibrational energy of the system equals @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of a single atom .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 is the momentum of particle @xmath12 in the direction of the cavity axis , @xmath13 denotes its distance from the trap centre and @xmath14 describes corrections to the nearest harmonic trapping potential with phonon frequency @xmath7 . to simplify the above hamiltonian",
    ", we now introduce the usual phonon annihilation and creation operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 of particle @xmath12 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 = 1 $ ] . when substituting these operators into eq .",
    "( [ vib1 ] ) , neglecting a constant term with no physical consequences and assuming , as an example , a cubic correction @xmath14 , we find that @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant . in the following ,",

    "we now have all the theoretical tools needed to analyse the dynamics of the trapped atomic gas during the proposed cyclic two - stage cooling process .      before doing so ,",
    "let us have a closer look at the most relevant expectation values .",
    "usually , in laser cooling , there is only one slowly - evolving expectation value , namely the mean phonon number @xmath1 per particle , @xmath45 however the cooling scheme , which we propose here , has two slowly - evolving phonon expectation values which play a crucial role in the cooling process .",
    "these are @xmath1 and the mean phonon correlation @xmath2 , @xmath46 both expectation values are independent of @xmath0 in the many - particle limit .",
    "notice that @xmath2 can only be defined when there are at least two particles in the trap . for only one particle",
    ", we always have @xmath47 .",
    "this is why the cooling process which we describe in this paper is qualitatively different from single - particle laser - cooling .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 , when the trapping potential of the particles is completely harmonic and the non - interacting atomic gas accumulates initially around the centre of the trap ( i.e.  at @xmath49 ) . to see that this is indeed the case , let us assume that there are indeed no interactions between the particles , that the cooling laser is turned off and that the atomic confinement is so strong that there is no flux of particles out of the trap . in this case , it is safe to assume that @xmath50 combining this observation with eqs .",

    "as we shall see below , the cooling laser moves the atoms to the centre of their trapping potential at @xmath53 .",

    "( [ zetazz ] ) we see that calculating @xmath2 at the end of the displacement stage only requires us to find the final distance @xmath52 of the atomic particles from the trap centre . in the absence of any laser driving and other quantum effects , the dynamics of @xmath52 follows the laws of classical mechanics .",
    "moreover , since there are no interactions between the particles , they move independently .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider only a single trapped particle . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the index @xmath12 of this particle in the following .",
    "however , analysing the dynamics of a single particle inside an asymmetric trapping potential , even classically , is not straightforward . in this subsection",
    ", we therefore moreover employ the following approximation and assume @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the return points of the oscillating atomic particles .",
    "these two positions can be calculated relatively easily , since they correspond to points of vanishing momentum @xmath57 . to calculate @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",

    "the trapped particles experience cooling _ and _ heating transitions on a time scale which scales as @xmath92 but without being multiplied with @xmath0 . as pointed out already in section [ introduction ] , cooling moves the atoms closer to the trap centre and reduces @xmath2 .",

    "the hotter the particles become , the more intense becomes their dynamics . eventually , all particles reach the centre of the trap which corresponds to a fix point of their dynamics .",
    "the overall effect of the transfer of the atoms , from their initial position to the centre of the trap , is a loss of vibrational energy ( c.f .",
