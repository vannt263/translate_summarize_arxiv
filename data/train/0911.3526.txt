    "driven by the wish to realize the proposed concepts of future spintronic devices  @xcite the development of novel nanostructures and nanomaterials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties has become a key challenge of today s research .",
    "a promising path to control the magnetic properties of matter is to use low - dimensional systems and to reduce their size down to the nanometer or even atomic scale . for nanoscale systems , however , an essential requirement is to enhance the magnetic anisotropy in order to stabilize magnetic order against thermal fluctuations or quantum tunneling .",
    "the manipulation of exchange interactions opens another path to create new materials with a magnetic state that may be tunable by external magnetic or electric fields.@xcite e.g.  the occurrence of chiral spin spiral states at surfaces has been demonstrated ,  @xcite their manipulation by electrical currents was suggested  @xcite and a way to grow films with multiple metastable magnetic states has been proposed .",
    "@xcite    the ability to create one - dimensional monoatomic magnetic chains of transition - metals on surfaces by self - organization @xcite or by manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope @xcite has recently opened new vistas to explore and manipulate artificial magnetic nanostructures even atom - by - atom . e.g.  the pioneering work of gambardella _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy of atomic transition - metal chains , consisting of co atoms on a stepped pt(111 ) surface , is dramatically enhanced with decreasing dimensionality from two - dimensional films to quasi - one - dimensional chains and depends sensitively on the number of co strands in a chain .",
    "these experimental observations were explained based on electronic structure calculations which emphasized the crucial role played by the substrate , reduced symmetry , and structural relaxations for the magneto - crystalline anisotropy.@xcite the large magnetic anisotropies led to slow relaxation dynamics of the magnetization and the observation of magnetic hysteresis loops at low temperatures indicative of ferromagnetic coupling . in another experiment ,",
    "mn chains of up to 10 atoms were created by manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip on an insulating cun layer grown on cu(001 ) .",
    "experimentally , the exchange interaction between individual spins was obtained by measuring the excitation spectrum via inelastic tunneling spectroscopy which showed the quantum behavior of the entire chain.@xcite even the sign and size of the exchange interaction between the mn atoms could be extracted from the experimental data .",
    "calculations based on density - functional theory ( dft ) clarified that a superexchange mechanism along the mn - n - mn bond is responsible for the weak antiferromagnetic coupling.@xcite    recently , hammer _ et al .",
    "_  have used a combination of iv - leed and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements to demonstrate that the ir(001 ) surface can serve as an ideal template to grow defect - free , nanometer long transition - metal nanowires of different structure , chemical composition , and length depending on the preparation conditions.@xcite  e.g.  biatomic fe chains can be created on the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface and lifting the surface reconstruction by hydrogen opens the possibility to produce fe - ir - fe triatomic chains .",
    "while the biatomic fe chains are a very promising system to study magnetism of ( quasi- ) one - dimensional transition - metal chains , there is little understanding so far .",
    "experimentally , it is extremely challenging as for laterally averaging measurements samples with a homogeneous distribution of chains are needed or a technique must be applied which allows to locally probe the magnetic properties of individual fe chains .",
    "another key difficulty is the detailed characterization of the chains structure . from combined stm and leed experiments",
    "it is only known that the biatomic chains grow in the trenches of the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface , however , the adsorption sites in the trenches could not be deduced . as structure and magnetism",
    "are closely correlated in such systems , their magnetic properties are an open issue .    a theoretical study using first - principles calculations  @xcite reported an excellent agreement with the structural parameters of the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface and concluded that the fe chains are strongly ferromagnetic at low temperatures but were probably non - magnetic in the room temperature measurements of hammer _ et al . _  however ,",
    "this theoretical study considered only ferromagnetic solutions and did not determine the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy which is crucial for an experimental verification of the proposed ferromagnetism in these chains . on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath2 transition - metal substrate such as ir can have dramatic consequences on the exchange coupling in a deposited fe nanostructure as is apparent from the observation of a complex nanoscale magnetic structure for an fe monolayer on ir(111),@xcite the antiferromagnetic ground state of an fe monolayer on w(001),@xcite to name just a few .",
    "recent studies on fe stripes on pt(997)@xcite and fept surface alloys@xcite report on strong correlation between complex magnetic ground states and the details of structural arrangement .    here",
    ", we use first - principles calculations based on density - functional theory to study the structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of biatomic fe chains deposited in the trenches of the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface.@xcite we focus on two structural arrangements of the biatomic chains which differ by the adsorption sites of the fe atoms . in one configuration",
    "the distance between the two strands of the biatomic chain is smaller than the atom spacing along the chain direction ( denoted as c1 in accordance with ref .  ) , while in the other their separation is clearly larger than the interchain spacing ( denoted as c4 ) , see fig .",
    "we consider collinear ferro- and antiferromagnetic arrangements along the chains and the @xmath1-state with two moments in one and one moment in the opposite direction .",
    "we find that the energetically favorable magnetic state as well as the easy magnetization axis of the fe chains depend sensitively on their atomic arrangement and local symmetry .",
    "for the fe chains in the c1-structure , the exchange coupling along the chain is ferromagnetic , however , due to hybridization with the ir substrate it is much weaker than for freestanding biatomic fe chains with the same atom spacing . due to their small separation ,",
    "the two strands of the c1-chains are also ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "surprisingly , for the c4-configuration , we find a transition from ferromagnetic state for free - standing chains to antiferromagnetic order along the biatomic chains after deposition on the ir substrate . in this case",
    ", the hybridization with the ir surface is strong enough to invert the sign of exchange coupling , while the two fe strands are nearly exchange decoupled .",
    "the interplay of the fe interstrand distance and the hybridization with the ir substrate results also in a different easy axis of the magnetization for the two structures : while in the c1-fm state the easy axis is out - of - plane , it switches into the chain axis for the c4-afm configuration .",
    "the total energy of the c1- and c4-structure are quite close and therefore both chain types could occur in an experiment depending on the growth conditions .",
    "we simulate measurements by stm and observe that the two strands of the biatomic fe chain in the c1-ferromagnetic state are too close to be individually resolved , while they can be distinguished in the c4-structure with an antiferromagnetic ground state . in the latter case , spin - polarized stm ( sp - stm ) should further allow to directly resolve the two - fold magnetic periodicity along the chain .",
    "@xmath3     the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section we present details of our method and the calculations .",
    "then we discuss the structural relaxations of the pure @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) substrate and of the biatomic fe chains in the two structural configurations on the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface . in section",
    "iv , we analyze the magnetic ground state configuration and the effects of hybridization with the ir substrate , before we turn to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in section  v. we explore the feasibility to experimentally resolve the different structural and magnetic properties by sp - stm and to verify our predictions of a structure - dependent magnetic ground state .",
    "finally , a conclusion and summary is given .",
    "we employed the film - version of the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method , as implemented in the jlich density - functional theory ( dft ) code fleur .",
    "we used inversion - symmetric films with 7 and 9 layers of the @xmath4 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface and fe biatomic chains on both sides of the slab .",
    "the whole system possesses spatial inversion symmetry .",
    "we calculate the biatomic fe chains in a @xmath4 supercell along the @xmath5-direction ( [ 011]-axis ) , perpendicular to the chain @xmath6-axis ( [ 011]-axis ) , which results in a distance of 13.75    between the axes of two adjacent biatomic chains , c.f .",
    "[ fig1 ] for structural arrangements and definition of the axes .",
    "the theoretical ir lattice constant we used for calculations constituted a value of 3.89   .",
    "we used the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga , revpbe functional@xcite ) of the exchange - correlation potential for the structural relaxations and tested total energy differences between the two magnetic configurations also within the local - density approximation ( lda , vwn functional@xcite ) .",
    "we used 18 @xmath7-points in a quarter of the full two - dimensional brillouin zone ( 2d - bz ) for self - consistent calculations .",
    "the calculated total energy differences between different magnetic ground states were carefully tested with respect to the number of @xmath7-points . for the basis functions",
    ", we used a cut - off parameter of @xmath8  a.u.@xmath9 for relaxations and 3.7  a.u.@xmath9 for comparing the total energies of different magnetic configurations .",
    "we considered two possible structural arrangements of the fe atoms denoted as c1 and c4 according to the notation of ref .",
    ", which are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed by stm @xcite that the biatomic chains grow in the trenches of the ( 5@xmath101 ) reconstructed ir(001 ) surface and we therefore focus on these two configurations .",
    "relaxations were performed until the forces changed by less than @xmath11  htr / a.u .",
    "the convergence of the relaxed atomic positions was carefully tested with respect to the computational parameters .",
    "relaxations were performed only for the ferromagnetic state of both c1 and c4 configurations and the antiferromagnetic and the @xmath1-states were calculated on these atomic positions .",
    "as a first step , we performed a structural relaxation of the pure @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface .",
    "as can be seen in table [ table_relaxation ] , the results we obtain with a film of 9 layers agree very well with the experimental data measured by iv - leed .",
    "@xcite in particular , the experimentally observed trench - like structure is reproduced .",
    "our values are also in close agreement with those obtained with the vasp code by spik _ et al._@xcite for deposited biatomic fe chains we have also found a very good agreement between the values of the relative atomic positions obtained by relaxing a slab with 9 and 7 layers of the ir substrate ( see table  [ table_relaxation ] ) .    we performed relaxations of the fe biatomic chains only for the ferromagnetic solutions to reduce the computational effort , presenting the results in table  [ table_relaxation ] . while the distance @xmath12 between the atomic strands in c1-configuration is 2.35   , and thus smaller than along the chain ( see figs",
    ".  1  and  2 ) , it is almost twice larger in the c4-configuration , i.e.  @xmath13   , and the two strands are well separated . in the latter structure , the fe atoms are also more embedded into the ir surface which is illustrated by the smaller vertical distance @xmath14 from the ir surface atoms between the two fe chain atoms ( denoted as ir4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the influence of the c4-chains on the buckling of the ir substrate is also more pronounced as can be seen from the increased vertical separations of the surface ir atoms .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) is a key quantity for nanoscale magnets as it determines the preferred direction of the magnetic moments and is crucial to stabilize the magnetic order against thermal fluctuations .",
    "we have calculated the mae for the fe chains within the gga employing the force theorem and found that its value is stable against the chosen ground state upon which we perform the perturbation . for the c1 structure , we considered the fm ground state and started from a converged ground state with an out - of - plane magnetization from which the mae was obtained by applying the force theorem for three possible high - symmetry directions : perpendicular to the surface and the chain axis ( along the @xmath18-axis ) , parallel to the axis of the chain ( @xmath19-direction ) and in the surface plane perpendicular to the chain s axis ( @xmath20-direction ) .",

    ", we construct the energy landscape based on the lowest power of the directional cosines of the magnetization with respect to the crystallographic axes which are allowed by symmetry .",
    "the coefficients are obtained from the values of mae@xmath21 and mae@xmath24 . ]    for the calculations of the mae in the c4-afm configuration we used a slab of 7 layers of the @xmath0 ir(001 ) substrate with 8 fe chain atoms in the unit cell and 144 @xmath7-points in the full 2d - bz ( again the stability of the mae with respect to the number of @xmath7-points was carefully checked ) .",
    "we obtain values of @xmath230.2  mev / fe for mae@xmath21 and 1.2  mev / fe for mae@xmath24 corresponding to a ground state with the magnetic moments along the chain axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mae](b ) . considering the accuracy of our calculations",
    "we conclude that the easy axis of the magnetization for the fe biatomic chains in the c4-afm configuration constitutes a plane which cuts through the chain axis and is perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "the mae and its dependence on the configuration can be qualitatively related to the anisotropy of the orbital moments in the system.@xcite for this purpose for different magnetization directions we compare the orbital moments inside the atomic spheres of fe chain atoms , @xmath25 , of the ir atoms in the surface layer , @xmath26 , and the total orbital moment per unit cell , @xmath27 , defined as the sum over the moments of the two fe chain atoms and the five ir surface atoms on one side of the slab .",
    "for the evaluation of @xmath27 we do not take into account the much smaller contributions from ir atoms deeper inside the slab .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic ground state in the c4 geometry , one should note that the sign of the orbital moments switches for atoms of antiparallel magnetization .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath27 in this case as the orbital moment summed over atoms in one half of the @xmath28 unit cell on one side of the slab",
    ".    in the c1-fm state the anisotropy of @xmath27 is in qualitative agreement with the anisotropy of the total energy : while for an out - of - plane magnetization @xmath27 reaches a value of 0.126@xmath29 , it constitutes only 0.083@xmath29 and 0.035@xmath29 for the @xmath20- and @xmath19-directions of the magnetization , respectively .",
    "therefore , the easy axis coincides with that along which the orbital moment is largest.@xcite this anisotropy of @xmath27 can be explained based on the dependence of the ir contributions on the magnetization direction . for an out - of - plane magnetization ,",
    "the values of @xmath26 are small and the total orbital moment is dominated by the fe atoms . in contrast , for a magnetization along the @xmath20- and the @xmath19-direction the ir orbital moments , @xmath26 , reach significant values , however , of opposite sign with respect to @xmath25 . for the @xmath20-magnetization direction with @xmath30 the value of the orbital moment of the ir4 atom ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is @xmath230.013@xmath29 , while for the @xmath19-magnetization it even reaches @xmath230.029@xmath29 and the corresponding value of @xmath25 is only 0.058@xmath29 .    in the c4-afm configuration of the fe chains",
    "the agreement between the anisotropy of the orbital moment and of the total energy is even better .",
    "while for the @xmath20-magnetization direction the value of @xmath27 is 0.160@xmath29 , it reaches much larger values of 0.239@xmath29 and 0.253@xmath29 for the @xmath18- and @xmath19-direction , respectively .",
    "the direction of the smallest total orbital moment , @xmath27 , coincides with the hard axis and , moreover , a very small difference between the values of @xmath27 for the two other directions corresponds to a very small energy difference mae@xmath21 . in this structural arrangement",
    "the anisotropy of the fe orbital moments , @xmath25 , dominates the anisotropy of @xmath27 .",
    "the contribution of the ir atoms to the total orbital moment is nearly independent of the magnetization direction . for the @xmath18- and @xmath19-magnetization directions @xmath25 is 0.100@xmath29 and 0.106@xmath29 , respectively , while it is only @xmath31 and thus much smaller for the hard @xmath20-magnetization axis .",
    "in the previous sections , we have demonstrated that the magnetic properties of biatomic fe chains on the @xmath0 ir(001 ) surface depend crucially on the atomic arrangement of the atoms . both easy magnetization direction and magnetic order change upon displacements of the fe atoms which changes the interaction between the two strands of the chain and their hybridization with the ir substrate . in order to verify our predictions experimentally , a technique with",

    "we performed extensive first - principles calculations to elucidate the interplay of structure and magnetism in biatomic fe chains on the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface .",
    "we find a crucial influence of the hybridization of fe chains with the ir substrate on the magnetic ground state of the wires .",
    "depending on the particular structural arrangement , the magnetic ground state switches from along - the - chain ferromagnetic for the c1 configuration with a smaller ( @xmath34  2.4   ) distance between the two strands , to antiferromagnetic for the c4 state for which this distance constitutes an almost twice larger value ( @xmath34  4.2   ) . in the c4 configuration ,",
    "the two strands of the chain are nearly decoupled in terms of exchange interaction , while we find strong ferromagnetic coupling in the c1 configuration .",
    "we also find that the direction of the magnetization in these two configurations is different : while in c1-fm chains the fe spin moments point out of plane with a value of the magnetic anisotropy of @xmath34  2  mev / fe with respect to in - plane directions , the magnetization in c4-afm chains can freely rotate in the plane of along - the - chain and out - of - plane directions at sufficiently small temperatures , protected from switching to the in - plane perpendicular to the chain direction by a value of @xmath34  1.2  mev / fe .",
    "the two different magnetic types of chains are very close in total energy , which facilitates their experimental observation and provides a considerable challenge for experimentalists to verify their magnetic ground state . with our calculations",
    "we provide theoretical evidence for the feasibility to use spin - polarized stm to resolve the atomic arrangement and magnetic order . considering the rather small calculated total energy differences between the different magnetic collinear solutions of the order of 20@xmath2330  mev / fe in both types of chains",
    ", we also can not exclude the occurrence of noncollinear magnetic states either due to exchange interactions or due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction driven by spin - orbit coupling.@xcite such non - collinear calculations were beyond the scope of the present work due to the large supercell required for realistic modeling of chains on the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface .",
    "however , future investigations of this system need to address this open question .",
    "qualitatively and quantitatively different energy landscapes of the magnetization direction in real space could also result in a different response of the magnetization with respect to external magnetic field or temperature , providing an additional channel for tackling the magnetism in these two types of chains experimentally .",

    "<S> using first - principles calculations , we demonstrate that the magnetic exchange interaction and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of biatomic fe chains grown in the trenches of the @xmath0 reconstructed ir(001 ) surface depend sensitively on the atomic arrangement of the fe atoms . </S>",
    "<S> two structural configurations have been considered which are suggested from recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> they differ by the local symmetry and the spacing between the two strands of the biatomic fe chain . </S>",
    "<S> since both configurations are very close in total energy they may coexist in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated collinear ferro- and antiferromagnetic solutions as well as a collinear state with two moments in one direction and one in the opposite direction ( @xmath1-state ) . for the structure with a small interchain spacing </S>",
    "<S> , there is a strong exchange interaction between the strands and the ferromagnetic state is energetically favorable . in the structure with larger spacing , </S>",
    "<S> the two strands are magnetically nearly decoupled and exhibit antiferromagnetic order along the chain . in both cases , due to hybridization with the ir substrate </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction along the chain axis is relatively small compared to freestanding biatomic iron chains . </S>",
    "<S> the easy magnetization axis of the fe chains also switches with the structural configuration and is out - of - plane for the ferromagnetic chains with small spacing and along the chain axis for the antiferromagnetic chains with large spacing between the two strands . </S>",
    "<S> calculated scanning tunneling microscopy images and spectra suggest the possibility to experimentally distinguish between the two structural and magnetic configurations . </S>"
