    "strong polarisation is expected when the pulsar optical emission is generated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "@xcite suggested that the continuous optical radiation from the crab nebula was due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "this was later confirmed by @xcite and @xcite who found that the optical radiation was polarised .",
    "incoherent synchrotron emission follows a simple relationship between its polarisation profile and underlying geometry .",
    "hence , optical polarisation measurements of pulsars provide an unique insight into the geometry of their emission regions , and therefore observational constraints on the theoretical models of the emission mechanisms . from an understanding of the emission geometry , one can limit the competing models for pulsar emission , and hence understand how pulsars work - a problem which has eluded astronomers for almost 50 years .",
    "polarimeters are sensitive in the optical , but the majority of pulsars are very faint at these wavelengths with v @xmath4 25 @xcite .",
    "polarimetry in the very high - energy domain , x - ray and gamma - ray , using instruments on board space telescopes , is of limited sensitivity .",
    "so far , detailed results have only been reported for the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "although the number of pulsars detected in the optical is growing , only five pulsars have had their optical polarisation measured ; crab @xcite , vela @xcite , psr b0540 - 69 @xcite psr b0656 + 14 @xcite , and psr b1509 - 58 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the optical currently remains invaluable for polarimetry in the energy domain above radio photon energies .",
    "the crab pulsar , being the brightest optical pulsar with v @xmath5 @xcite , has had several measurements of its optical polarisation , including both phase - averaged and phase - resolved studies .",
    "the first phase - resolved observations of the optical linear polarisation of the crab pulsar were those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "those studies showed that the polarisation position angle changes through each peak in the pulsar lightcurve , and that the degree of polarisation falls and rises within each peak , reaching its minimum value shortly after the pulse peak .",
    "these observations were limited to the main and inter pulse phase regions only , because at the time it was thought that the pulsar radiated its optical emission through the pulse peaks only . however , a number of phase - resolved imaging observations of the pulsar @xcite showed that the optical emission actually persists throughout the pulsar s entire rotation cycle , at the level of @xmath6 of the maximum main - pulse intensity .    with this in mind ,",
    "observations of the optical linear polarisation of the crab pulsar were made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these results confirmed the previous observations , and were the first studies to reveal the polarisation profile of the pulsar during the bridge and off - pulse phase regions .",
    "they also found that the off - pulse region is highly polarised .",
    "the degree of polarisation was 70% and @xmath7 for @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite report the most detailed phase - resolved observations of the optical linear polarisation of the crab pulsar .",
    "their results are consistent with previous observations albeit with better definition and statistics , and can be explained in the context of the two - pole caustic model @xcite , the outer - gap model @xcite , and the striped - wind model @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of the inner nebula , in the optical and x - rays , have revealed a torus structure , that is bisected by oppositely - directed jets , knots , and a series of highly variable synchrotron wisps @xcite",
    ". a bright knot of synchrotron emission is located 065 se of the pulsar .",
    "it is highly polarised and is slightly variable in both its location and its brightness @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that it is radiation from an oblique termination shock in the pulsar wind nebula . in this model ,",
    "the earth line - of - sight is tangent to the flow at the position of the knot , hence the intensity is doppler boosted for synchrotron emission in the mildly relativistic post - shock flow .",
    "the results of their relativistic mhd simulations show that the knot is highly variable and can dominate the gamma - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "it has been suggested that this knot is responsible for the highly polarised off - pulse emission seen in time - resolved observations in the optical @xcite and gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the knot has no counterpart to the nw of the pulsar , but there is a faint second knot located 38 se of the pulsar , the so called outer knot .    the wisps consist of wisp 1 , a thin wisp located 18 nw of the pulsar , and the counter wisp located 83 se of the pulsar .",
    "wisp 1 , located 73 nw of the pulsar , breaks into three separate and distinct components ; 1-a , 1-b , and 1-c @xcite .",
    "however , one must note that this does not represent the constant configuration of the wisps .",
    "the wisps are interpreted as magnetic flux tubes that undergo unstable synchrotron cooling @xcite . a number of follow - up observations of the inner nebula have confirmed the presence of the wisps @xcite .",
    "the nw wisps are more prominent than the se wisps due to doppler beaming of the flow .",
    "@xcite studied the behaviour of the wisps nw of the pulsar in both the optical and x - rays .",
    "they observed that the wisps form and move off from the region associated with the termination shock of the pulsar wind , roughly once per year .",
    "moreover , they found that the precise locations of the nw wisps in the optical and x - rays are similar but not exactly coincident , with x - ray wisps located closer to the pulsar .",
    "this would suggest that the optical and x - ray wisps are not produced by the same particle distribution . in terms of mhd models",
    ", they found that the optical wisps are more strongly doppler - boosted than the x - ray wisps .",
    "for a more detailed review of the crab nebula see @xcite .",
    "+ the first optical linear polarisation maps of the crab nebula were produced by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of the linear polarisation of the nebula , in the range 2.65.2 kev , yield polarisation of 19% at a position angle of 152156within a radius of 3of the pulsar @xcite . these results are in agreement with the optical measurements of the polarisation , which give polarisation of 19% at a position angle 162for the central nebular region within a radius of @xmath8 05 @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the polarisation of the crab nebula and pulsar in the off - pulse phase using the integral / spi telescope , and showed that the polarisation e - vector ( 124@xmath9 ) is aligned with the spin - axis of the neutron star ( @xcite ; 110@xmath10 , where the first uncertainty is the measurement uncertainty and the second is from the reference frame uncertainty ) .",
    "this result was later confirmed by @xcite , in the off - pulse phase region using the integral / ibis telescope ( 120.6@xmath11 ) , and has also been seen in optical observations @xcite .",
    "the spi and ibis measurements both encompass the entire nebula and pulsar , and so are dominated by nebular emission . as with the optical observations @xcite , they found the off - pulse region to be highly polarised .",
    "+ the purpose of this work is two fold .",
    "firstly , we want to check the polarisation of the pulsar , knot , and wisps for variability .",
    "it is difficult to determine the polarisation for objects embedded in a strong nebular background .",
    "so , in order to determine the crab pulsar s polarisation profile , we need to know the level of background polarisation .",
    "therefore , the second purpose of this work is to accurately map the polarisation of the inner crab nebula .",
    "this will then act as a guideline for future time - resolved polarisation measurements of the crab pulsar using the galway astronomical stokes polarimeter ( gasp ) .",
    "this is an ultra - high - speed , full stokes , astronomical imaging polarimeter based on the division of amplitude polarimeter ( doap ) .",
    "it has been designed to resolve extremely rapid variations in objects such as optical pulsars and magnetic cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have studied the phase - averaged polarisation properties of the crab pulsar and its nearby synchrotron knot using archival hst / acs data .",
    "we note that the dataset analysed in this paper has previously been used by @xcite to examine the morphology and structure of the polarised components of the inner nebula . however , we have produced polarisation vector maps of the inner nebula and measured , for the first time , the degree of linear polarisation and the position angle of the pulsar s integrated pulse beam , and of its nearby synchrotron knot . furthermore , this work marks the first high - spatial resolution multi - epoch study of the variability of the polarisation of the inner nebula and pulsar .",
    "the results for the crab pulsar are @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ( see table 6 ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with those of @xcite using the high - time resolution photo - polarimeter optima @xcite , once dc substracted .",
    "they measure phase - averaged values of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , which is not dc subtracted and includes the emission from the inner knot due to the optima aperture .",
    "they measure values of @xmath14 , and @xmath15 after dc subtraction , and it is this later measurement that agrees with our own .",
    "the optical polarisation of the crab pulsar has also been measured by @xcite ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , and @xcite ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "we note that the polarisation of the inner knot ( @xmath20 ) is a factor of two larger than the off - pulse polarisation of 33% obtained from optima observations @xcite and consistent with the older measurements of @xcite ( 70% ) and @xcite ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is partially due to the uncertainty of determining the phase interval bracketing the minimum of the crab s lightcurve , hence the contribution of the dc component ( see fig .",
    "5 of * ? ? ?",
    "it could also be partially due to uncertainties in the estimate of the sky background in the optima data and/or the contribution from the sky and pulsar off - pulse  flux .",
    "@xcite give the unpulsed pulsar flux to be 0.02 mjy compared to 0.03 mjy from the knot ( this work ) .",
    "we estimate the contribution from the sky for optima data to be equivalent to 0.04 mjy based on the pupil size of 235 and a 21 magnitude / arcsec@xmath21 sky background . this would be sufficient to explain the difference .",
    "two - dimensional phase - resolved polarisation observations will allow us to better quantify the knot contribution to the dc component .",
    "x - ray observations of the nebula taken by chandra @xcite , reveal a torus with bipolar jets emanating outwards from se and nw of the pulsar .",
    "@xcite found that the axis of symmetry of the jet is rougly aligned with the pulsar s proper motion vector .",
    "the crab torus , bisecting the synchrotron wisps , can be traced back to the knot of synchrotron emission seen @xmath22 se of the pulsar .",
    "our measurement of the polarisation pa of the synchrotron knot , @xmath23 , agrees with the crab torus @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we also found evidence for an apparent alignment between the pulsar polarisation pa ( 105.1@xmath25 ) and proper motion vector ( @xcite ; 110@xmath10 ) ( see figure 9 ) . @xcite",
    "have found the same scenario for the vela pulsar .",
    "those authors found an apparent alignment between the polarisation position angle of the pulsar , the axis of symmetry of the x - ray arcs and jets ( chandra ; @xcite , @xcite ) , and the pulsar s proper motion vector .",
    "this suggests that the kick  given to neutron stars at birth is directed along the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "the alternative view is that the apparent alignment is an effect of projection onto the sky plane , and that there is no physical jet along the axis of rotation @xcite .",
    "more concrete measurements of the optical polarisation of pulsars will yield the needed observational restraints on these hypotheses .",
    "+ as mentioned previously , the polarisation of the wisps was also studied .",
    "our photometry accounts for the outward motion of the wisps . from analysis of the wisps in each epoch , we find that the wisps show variation in both location and brightness on time scales of a few weeks .",
    "we found that all of these wisps have similar values of degree of polarisation ( @xmath26 ) and position angles equal to that of the synchrotron knot ( @xmath27 ) . hence , as with the synchrotron knot , they are aligned with the spin - axis of the pulsar .",
    "also , wisps 1-a is not visible in the frames from 2005 spetember to 2005 october 12 inclusive , and may be merged with wisp 1-b during this period .",
    "examining the polarisation vectors maps , one can see that the position angles of the wisps are different to those of the rest of the nebula , where the position angles are aligned ns ( figures 2 and 7 ) .",
    "figure 10 is a histogram of the distribution of the polarisation position angles of the inner nebula .",
    "the position angles were extracted from the values in the polarisation map . from this histogram",
    "we see that the polarisation position angle of the pulsar environment ( @xmath27 ) is away from the peak of the nebula distribution ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this means that the polarisation properties of the structures close to the pulsar are different from those of the rest of the inner nebula . +",
    "as discussed earlier , using a @xmath29 goodness - of - fit , we found no significant variation ( at the 95% confidence level ) in the polarisation of the pulsar , knot , and wisps over a 3 month period .",
    "the knot is variable in flux but fairly constant in polarisation .",
    "this variation in flux may be explained in terms of an increased plasma density in the vicinity of the knot . whereas the wisps have constant flux and constant polarisation over this period of time .",
    "this would suggest that the magnetic fields within the nebula are uniform over time .",
    "however , more detailed follow - up observations will be needed to determine if there is any longer term variation .",
    "we have studied the phase - averaged polarisation properties of the crab pulsar and its nearby synchrotron knot using archival hst / acs data .",
    "this marks the first high - spatial resolution multi - epoch study of the polarisation of the inner nebula and pulsar .",
    "we found an apparent alignment between the polarisation position angle of the pulsar and the pulsar s proper motion vector .",
    "we confirm that the inner knot is responsible for the highly polarised off - pulse emission seen in observations in the optical .",
    "we found that the inner knot is variable in position , and brightness over the period of these observations .",
    "these are the first quantified measurements of such a variation .",
    "we note that we found evidence of a possible variation of the knot polarisation ( at @xmath30 ) which is due neither to a known systematic effect nor to the spike contribution .",
    "future observations will help to address this point .",
    "we have also measured the polarisation of the wisps in the inner nebula , and found no significant variation in their polarisation over this 3 month period of observations .",
    "+ polarisation measurements give an unique insight into the geometry of the pulsar emission regions .",
    "more multi - wavelength polarisation observations of pulsars , both phase - averaged and phase - resolved , with instruments such as hst / acs and gasp ( optical ) , and integral / ibis ( gamma - ray ) , will help to provide the much needed data to constrain the theoretical models .",
    "+ for example , @xcite have developed an inverse mapping approach for determining the emission height of the optical photons from pulsars .",
    "it uses the optical stokes parameters to determine the most likely geometry for emission , including : magnetic field inclination angle ( @xmath31 ) , the observers line of sight angle ( @xmath32 ) , and emission height .",
