    "when a light is irradiated to a metal , charge density oscillation arises by the electric filed of the light .",
    "resonance between the electric field caused by this charge density oscillation and the external field is plasmonic resonance .",
    "plasmon on a surface of a nanosphere , in particular , draws much attention because of strong enhancement of the electric field .",
    "such a plasmonic phenonenon is called a localized surface plasmon ( lsp ) .",
    "enhancement of the optical electric field can be applied not only in the optical information processing but also in chemical and biological sensing .",
    "are one of branches of the nanophotonics other than the plasmonics . periodic variation of dielectric constant with the periodicity of the same magnitude to the optical wavelength exists in a photonic crystal .",
    "accordingly , photonic band structure takes place .",
    "lights of a specific wavelength can not exist in the photonic crystal .",
    "colloidal spheres arranges in a colloidal crystal regularly with a periodicity of the same magnitude of the optical wavelength .",
    "colloidal crystals can , therefore , work as photonic crystals .    recently",
    "several authors@xcite fabricated hybrid structures of the lsp and the colloidal photonic crystal .",
    "hybrid structures with plasmonic nanostructures formed on a photonic crystal are sometimes termed hybrid plasmonic - photonic crystals .",
    "enhancement of the optical electric field stronger than that due to the lsp alone was reported .",
    "au nanoparticles / nanostructure were used to exhibit the lsp resonance by some studies@xcite because of the chemical stability of au .",
    "thus , robustness in applications is expected . on the other hand ,",
    "ag nanoparticles / nanostructure were employed in some studies@xcite because of their high performance of the electric field enhancement . for the photonic crystal material , polystyrene ( a regular array of particles or a regular pattern )",
    "was selected in some studies@xcite , while poly(methyl methacrylate ) was used by xu et al.@xcite and silica was used by kim et al.@xcite an advantage of polystyrene is narrow particle size dispersity .",
    "polystyrene suspensions with the dispersity less than few percent in the coefficient of variation can be synthesized by a soap - free emulsion polymerization.@xcite    in particular , tao , et al.@xcite achieved an enhancement factor up to 260-fold .",
    "we have mentioned above that an intuitive explanation of the enhancement of the optical electric field due to the lsp is based on the directional concentration of the electric field . because the light in the photonic band gap is completely reflected by the photonic crystal , when the lsp resonance wavelength and the photonic band gap wavelength coincide with each other , the leakage of the field into the side of the photonic crystal is prohibited .",
    "it will result in the stronger enhancement of the electric field than that by the lsp alone .",
    "a much stronger enhancement is expected by more excellent coincidence between the lsp resonance and the photonic band gap .",
    "dried colloidal crystals ( opals ) were used as photonic crystals in previous studies . in these case , one of ways of tuning photonic band structure is to change the size of colloidal spheres .",
    "the photonic band can , alternatively , be tuned by altering the volume fraction by lopez - garcia et al.@xcite for a hybrid photonic - plasmonic crystal ( polystyrene microspheres on an au substrate ) . to accomplish a delicate tuning",
    ", gel - immobilized colloidal crystals@xcite are promising .",
    "the photonic band of a gel - immobilized colloidal crystal is tunable due to an external force.@xcite an excellent coincidence between the lsp resonance and the photonic band gap is expected due to tuning of the photonic band .",
    "we have tried to replace an opal with a gel - immobilized colloidal crystal.@xcite reflection spectra in the normal direction were measured for gel - immobilized colloidal crystals with au nanoparicles deposited on their surface by immersion into an au nanoparticle aqueous dispersion .",
    "various immersion time up to 24 hrs ( 0 , 1 , 6 , 12 , and 24 hrs ) were tested .",
    "overall reflectivity for 1 hr sample was lower than that for 0 hr sample .",
    "it increased with immersion time for 6 hr , 12 hr , and 24 hr samples .",
    "peaks exhibiting photonic band structure were observed for 0 hr and 1 hr samples .",
    "those peaks disappeared for 6 hr , 12 hr , and 24 hr samples . taking into consideration the fact that the enhancement of electric field results from directional concentration , the decrease in reflectivity implies the emission of light to directions other than that for the measurement .",
    "enhancement of electric field can be expected in this preliminary study .",
    "the purpose in this paper is to observe the nanostructure on a surface of a gel - immobilized colloidal crystal .",
    "direct detection of a near field of enhanced electric field is not only expensive but also requires specific skills .",
    "electric field calculation is helpful to complement . to this end",
    ", one should know the structure in detail . because in a preliminary study@xcite samples with immersion time longer than 6 hrs exhibited feature - less reflectivity spectrum , we prepared samples for the immersion time up to 2 hrs .",
    "we speculated that for such a long immersion time an au thin film formed .",
    "in other words , it is a strategy to start with simple structures formed for a short immersion time and then to proceed complicated structure formed for a long immersion time .",
    "however , if the number density of nanoparticles on the surface is too low , cases can be arisen that no particles are seen in the observe area .",
    "we report in this paper results of atomic force microscope ( afm ) observation for a 2 hr sample .",

    "we tried to an energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .",
    "unfortunately , the au peak in an edx spectrum even for a dried 40 nm au nanoparticle dispersion was very faint .",
    "that is , without notifying the targeted composition of au it was difficult to specify the composition from the edx spectra alone .",
    "the au peaks in the edx spectra were undetectably faint for 2 hr immersion samples .",
    "we emphasize here that the afm images of au nanoparticles in dried au nanoparticle dispersion were indistinguishably similar to 40 nm objects in fig .  [",
