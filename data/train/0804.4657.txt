    "in their seminal paper on algebraic functions and their geometric applications ( @xcite , 1879 ) , brill and noether calculated the expected dimension @xmath5 of the family of maps from a general curve of genus @xmath0 to @xmath2 however , they did not prove that the family has dimension exactly @xmath6 or even that any such maps exist .",
    "the existence theorem was first proved with twentieth - century rigor by kleiman and laksov ( @xcite , 1972 ; @xcite , 1974 ) and independently by kempf ( @xcite , 1971 ) . the non - existence and dimensionality results were proved by griffiths and harris ( @xcite , 1980 ) and refined by eisenbud and harris ( @xcite , 1986 , @xcite , 1986 ) .",
    "griffiths , harris and eisenbud s proofs extend almost verbatim to the case when one imposes in addition the condition that the linear system must have a specified type of ramification at a general fixed point @xmath7 of the curve .",
    "but this raises the more basic question of whether a @xmath8 exists with the specified ramification at any point at all . in particular , let @xmath9 be a general curve of genus @xmath10 and let positive integers @xmath11 @xmath1 and @xmath12 be given .",
    "does there exist a @xmath8 on @xmath9 possessing vanishing sequence @xmath13 at any point @xmath14 ?",
    "if so , what is the dimension of the set of such pairs @xmath15 ?",
    "if the dimension is zero , how many actual pairs are there ?    based on the classical brill - noether theorems and the theorems for fixed general ramification points , one might be led to make the nave conjecture that the family of @xmath8 s with a given ramification type exists if and only if the expected dimension is greater than or equal to zero , and has the expected dimension .",
    "this paper will show that the na\"ive statement holds perfectly when @xmath16 when @xmath17 the existence can fail , but it can be decided by an explicit numerical criterion ( theorem [ wrd ] ) .",
    "the dimension is exact when @xmath18 or @xmath19 for @xmath20 we prove a weak general bound on the dimension .",
    "section [ prel ] will provide some preliminary definitions and notation for reference .",
    "section [ gp ] contains a proof of the existence criterion , by calculating the intersection class of the family of such maps in terms of theta classes on the picard variety .",
    "if the intersection class is nonzero , then the locus must be non - empty .",
    "the family @xmath21 is a degeneracy locus of a morphism of filtered vector bundles on the product @xmath22 and its class can be expanded as a sum of determinants . in section [ lls ]",
    "we prove the dimensionality theorem for @xmath18 ( theorem [ r1 ] ) and the weak general bound ( theorem [ wkbd ] ) .",
    "we can degenerate any linear systems on the general curve to limit linear systems on a special reducible curve @xmath23 which will be a flag curve consisting only of rational and elliptic components .",
    "the inequalities that define limit linear series will allow us to determine the possible limit linear series explicitly on each component and bound their dimension . by the upper semicontinuity property , the dimension on the limit @xmath24 is greater than or equal to the dimension on the general curve , so we obtain upper bounds on the general curve .",
    "section [ pc ] uses the extrinsic geometry of curves in @xmath25 with fixed points to complete the dimensionality proof for @xmath26 ( theorem [ r2 ] ) .",
    "all degree @xmath1 curves form a projective space of dimension @xmath27 all point conditions cut out linear subspaces of this projective space , so up to @xmath28 of them always impose independent conditions .",
    "we shall see that when @xmath29 the dimension of the subscheme of plane curves of degree @xmath1 and genus @xmath0 that satisfy the given ramification condition is strictly less than the number of degrees of freedom allowed by the moduli space of curves of genus @xmath10 the automorphisms of @xmath30 and the ramification point and the nodes .",
    "hence the general curve does not admit a map to such a plane curve .    while the nonexistence proof for @xmath26 appears ad hoc ,",
    "it does demonstrate that there are ramified limit linear systems on the flag curve that do not extend to linear systems on the general curve .",
    "the flag curve is not ",
    "sufficiently general  with respect to brill - noether conditions with moving ramification points , although it is ",
    "sufficiently general  to detect such conditions without ramification or with only fixed ramification .",
    "so the failure of the degeneration proof should not be construed as strong evidence against the dimensionality conjecture in general .",
    "we begin with a smooth , connected , projective curve @xmath31 of genus @xmath0 over the complex numbers @xmath32 this section will provide a reference for definitions and important lemmas .",
    "a linear system of degree @xmath1 and dimension @xmath33 or @xmath34 on @xmath31 , is an @xmath35-dimensional vector space of linearly equivalent divisors on @xmath36    it will be helpful to use both additive and multiplicative notation .",
    "multiplicatively , a @xmath8 can be given as a pair @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a line bundle on @xmath31 and @xmath39 is an @xmath35-dimensional subspace of @xmath40 a basis of @xmath39 will be denoted by @xmath41 additively , a @xmath8 will be given as a vector space @xmath42 of linearly equivalent divisors on @xmath43 with basis @xmath44 if @xmath42 is base - point - free , that is , if there is no point @xmath7 contained in every divisor in @xmath45 then @xmath42 determines a map @xmath46 of degree @xmath1 from the curve @xmath31 to projective space @xmath47 up to projective equivalence .",
