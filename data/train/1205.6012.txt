    "it is already more than forty years since wheeler s original conjecture that black holes have no hair .",
    "although there was an intensive analysis on this claim ( for a review and references see @xcite ) , the situation , for the minimally coupled scalar field , was clarified in the nineties . when the spacetime is asymptotically flat there are two theorems that strongly constraint the existence of black holes when the energy momentum satisfies the dominant @xcite and the weak energy conditions @xcite . when just the null energy condition is required there is numerical evidence on the existence of asymptotically flat four dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "it is particularly timely to consider the astrophyical relevance of this problem .",
    "actually , it has been pointed out that the angular and quadrupolar momentum , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , of the black hole located at the center of our galaxy , sgra * , can be determined by the orbital precession of stars very near to it , therefore allowing to check the relation @xmath2 that follows from the kerr solution @xcite . due to the uniqueness and no hair theorems of",
    "asymptotically flat , four dimensional , general relativity this would test the experimental validity of the hypothesis that they involve .    in an attempt to construct a hairy rotating black hole , an exact family of stationary and axisymmetric petrov type d spacetimes",
    "was found when either a ( non)-minimally coupled scalar field  or a generic non - linear sigma model is the source of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "it was found that the most general potential that allows for the integration of the field equations can be off - shell found if the geodesic motion on the scalar manifold is integrable .",
    "the form of the spacetime metric is however independent of the scalar manifold metric .",
    "this paper provides a discussion on some physical implications that follow from the existence of these hairy black holes .",
    "the simplest case of a single , minimally coupled , scalar field is very interesting .",
    "since the lagrangian has no continuos symmetry , is not possible to associate it with a conserved current , and therefore is a natural candidate to be a dark matter component .",
    "the only source for the scalar field can be its self interaction .",
    "the analysis of @xcite allows to find , in this case , a generic potential compatible with the einstein equations : @xmath3 this is the most general potential allowing for uncharged , stationary and axisymmetric , petrov type d solutions of the plebanski - demianski type . here",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the newton constant@xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 is the cosmological constant and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are parameters of the potential .",
    "this potential still makes sense when @xmath11 and , as is shown in this work , the spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein equation are continuos deformations of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "therefore , an interesting result of this paper is to single out the first exact , uncharged , asymptotically flat , black hole with everywhere regular geometry and matter field except at the usual schwarzschild singularity .",
    "when @xmath11 , the existence of these modifications to the physically relevant schwarzschild spacetime are pertinent to the motion of test particles following geodesics in this geometry .",
    "it is important to stress that no difference is expected to arise in the gravitational field outside of a star since , in these cases , a discontinuity appears in the derivative of the gravitational field at the surface of the star , and the lack of a conserved current for the scalar field make this disconuity incompatible with its existence in the first place .",
    "the modified gravitational field introduced and discussed in this work is relevant as a model for black holes . in this case",
    ", the dimensionless parameter @xmath10 , plays a very important role in setting the strenght of the gravitational field .",
    "actually , for large enough values of the parameter @xmath10,@xmath12the strenght of the gravitational field of a hairy black hole can be made esentially flat all the way from its surface up to regions as far from the location of the event horizon as the model would require .",
    "moreover , the fact that the parameter @xmath10 does not enter in the komar mass allows to introduce an extra parameter in the gravitational field of a black hole , providing a new astrophyiscal tool to fit the measured gravitational field of any black hole configuration to this exact , analytical model , derived from general relativity .",
    "the existence of scalar fields has been already considered to be relevant to stellar kinematics @xcite , and it has been noted that these models will be experimentally tested in the future gravitational wave measurements @xcite .",
    "most of the paper is restricted to the case when @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the scalar field potential is unbounded from below , which , would suggest that the solution is unstable .",
    "however , this is just an artifact of the @xmath11 limit and , as it is explicitly shown , for @xmath13 the potential can be made convex sitting at its global minimum at infinity .    to close this introduction",
    "we would like to acknowledge that the fact that it is possible relaxing the boundary conditions for gravitating scalar fields in anti de sitter spacetime @xcite is what fuelled the expectation that exact solutions of this system should exist @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that the black holes of @xcite still make sense when the cosmological constant vanishes .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the second section the solutions and the potential are described and the energy momentum tensor is shown to satisfy the null energy condition .",
    "the third section describes the existence of two kinds of solutions in this hairy black hole family .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the computation of the komar mass and how it satisfies the first law of black hole thermodynamics . a further degeneration in the configuration",
    "is shown to exist .",
    "the fifth section describes the behavior of the gravitational potential that a geodesic test particle feels in this background , the dimensionless parameter @xmath10 sets the strenght of it .",
    "the last section describes how a positive cosmological constant improves the convexity of the potential .",
    "finally , some remarks are made on the results of this paper .",
    "the notation follows  @xcite .",
    "the conventions of curvature tensors are such that a sphere in an orthonormal frame has positive riemann tensor and scalar curvature .",
    "the metric signature is taken to be @xmath14 .",
    "greek letters are in the coordinate tangent space .",
    "since we set @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the gravitational constant has units of lenght squated @xmath17   = l^{2}.$ ]",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this paper study the first exact , asymptotically flat , solutions of the classical model : @xmath18   , \\ ] ] with field equations : @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 the following configurations are exact solution of this system @xcite : @xmath22@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the line element of a unit two - sphere .",
    "@xmath28 is the only integration constant of the black hole .",
    "the solution and theory are invariant under the transformation @xmath29 .    the energy momentum of the scalar field , in a comoving tetrad , has the form @xmath30 and , in the static regions of the spacetime , defined by @xmath31 , satisfies the null energy condition : @xmath32 in the hairless limit",
    ", @xmath33 , the change of coordinates @xmath34 brings the hairy solution ( [ m1])-([m3 ] ) to the familiar schwarzschild black hole : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .    the asymptotic behavior of the metric functions at @xmath37 is:@xmath38 @xmath39 it follows from these expressions that the leading behavior of the metric is the same than the schwarzschild solution with the radial coordinate given by @xmath40 .",
    "the cases with @xmath41 and @xmath42 are special , and will be treated in a forthcoming publication where an exhaustive classification of the solutions for this potential will be made .",
    "one can notice that the potential ( [ potnol ] ) has a different behavior at @xmath43 . from this observation",
    "it follows that there are two solutions , depending on the branch that one is considering . for further",
    "analysis is better to parametrize the solution with the dimensionless coordinate @xmath44 , such that now the asymptotic region is at @xmath45 .",
    "the convention of this paper is such that the solution : @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48@xmath49 with @xmath50 is defined as the positive branch while the negative branch is the one defined for @xmath51 .",
    "the computation of the komar mass is straightforward .",
    "the result is given by : @xmath52 the subscript ( @xmath53 ) indicates that this is the mass for the region @xmath51 .",
    "the change in the orientation of the outward normal implies that the positive branch has mass @xmath54 .",
    "the integration constant of the problem is @xmath28 and the parameters of the lagrangian are @xmath9 and @xmath10 . given these two parameters there are two configurations , the positive and the negative branch .",
    "therefore , given the two parameters , the boundary conditions and the mass , each of the branches is completely characterized after solving @xmath28 from : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that ( [ cubi ] ) always has one real solution .",
    "the discriminant of this cubic is:@xmath57 the degeneration in @xmath28-s for each branch can be described as follows :    * @xmath58 . in this case",
    "there is a double degeneration on each branch given by the values @xmath59 and @xmath60 . *",
    "@xmath61 . in this case",
    "there is only one @xmath28 .",
    "* @xmath62 .",
    "there is a triple degeneration . *",
    "there is only one black hole .",
    "the case with @xmath64 is pathological when @xmath11 , and excluded from this analysis .",
    "this degeneration of the solutions is very interesting from a thermodynamical point of view , which although out of the scope of this work , is presented here for completeness on the description of the black holes .",
    "the entropy is one quarter of the area : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the solution to @xmath67 the temperature is defined to make the euclidean continuation smooth : @xmath68 where the subscript @xmath69 indicates the temperatures for the black holes defined by the positive and negative branch respectively . with these results at hand",
    "it is straightforward to check that : @xmath70 where , the variation let the parameters of the lagrangian , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , fixed .",
    "all these quantities have smooth limits when @xmath41 .",
    "a test particle moving in this gravitational field satisfies the geodesic equation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are conserved quantities and the dot stands for the derivative respect to the geodesic affine parameter . if the coordinate @xmath74 is introduced it is clear that the @xmath75 term is the actual gravitational potential that a test particle feels on this background .    therefore , to undertand the departure of the geodesic motion from the expected from the schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath33 ) , is enough to compare minus the lapse function , @xmath76 , for differents values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is imporant to remark that all the corrections of the geodesic motion in the schwarzschild geometry to the newtonian behavior are proportional to the angular momentum of the particle .",
    "the lapse function in the @xmath33 case is just the keplerian potential .      to model the same black hole in the different theories , defined by the different values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , it is necessary to fix its area",
    "thus , let us fix it as follows : @xmath77 where @xmath78 defines the area of the horizon to be @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the location of the horizon defined by @xmath81 .",
    "this defintion of @xmath28 allows to writte @xmath82 as : @xmath83     for a fixed horizon area .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath84 this function is the analogue of the logarithm of the radial coordinate in the schwarzschild geometry , * normalized to be zero at the horizon*.,width=364,height=268 ]    the definition of the location of the horizon can be used to find the value of the parameter @xmath9 in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath28 and @xmath10 .",
    "finally , @xmath28 and @xmath9 can be replaced in the negative of the lapse function to obtain @xmath85 as a function of @xmath86 , @xmath80 and @xmath10 .",
    "these graphs are independent of @xmath78 .",
    "they depend on @xmath80 through the relation of the komar mass and @xmath78 and the relation of @xmath9 and @xmath87 .     for a fixed horizon .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath84this function is the analogue of the logarithm of the radial coordinate in the schwarzschild geometry , * normalized to be zero at the horizon*.,width=364,height=268 ]    the fact that the horizontal axis is on a logarithmic scale shows how flat can the gravitational field be made in the presence of the scalar field .",
    "this effect is a purely general relativistic effect .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the second derivative of the scalar field potential is zero at @xmath88 , and therefore the scalar field is massless at infinity .",
    "however this massless scalar , due to the non - linear structure of the einstein equations , has a strong effect in the gravitational field ; it smoothly enhance the gravitational field from the schwarzschild solution to large deviations from it .",
    "when @xmath11 the potential is odd , namely @xmath89 .",
    "it follows that the stability of these solutions is an issue that should be addressed .",
    "while the actual calculation on the mechanical stability is a non - trival task , that will be addresed on a future work , this section shows that there are positive values of the cosmological constant that make the potential convex .",
    "the more general potential ( [ pot1 ] ) , modifies the solution presented here in a simple way : @xmath90    to understand the structure of the potential when @xmath13 , we note that , as follows from ( [ pot1 ] ) , the potential is even if @xmath91 . in this case",
    "( [ pot1 ] ) takes the following form : @xmath92    from the form of the even potential it follows that its leading asymptotic form is : @xmath93    more generally , the potential has the following asymptotic expansions for large values of @xmath94 : @xmath95    when @xmath64 the leading behavior of the potential is : @xmath96    it can be noticed from ( [ pot2 ] ) that when @xmath97 the leading behavior at infinity is also different .",
    "in fact , @xmath98 .",
    "it is possible to make a classification of all the possible behaviors of the potential for different values of @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "this classification will be reported separatedly because it contains more than twenty different situations .",
    "the case that is more compelling in favor of the stability is :    * when * @xmath99 * and * @xmath100**. the potential is positive for large values of * * @xmath101**. the scalar field potential has a minimum at * * @xmath88 .",
    "the reparametrization of the solution in terms of @xmath80 , @xmath78 and @xmath10 implies that : @xmath102 it follows from this expression that all the cases of the negative branch of the previous section can satisfy @xmath103 for a range of positive values for @xmath8 .",
    "these values can be made as small as required for small enough @xmath80 .",
    "before this work there was only one uncharged , spherically symmetric black hole in four dimensional general relativity ; now there is an infinite family of them .",
    "inded , we make reference to configurations that are everywhere regular except at the usual schwarzschild singularity .",
    "as follows from the analysis of the lapse function , the scalar field allows to have much larger than schwarzschild ammounts of mass in a given region of the spacetime . if this scalar field would actually exist",
    ", relatively small black holes can be much more massive than one would expect based on the schwarzschild solution .",
    "these smaller but massive black holes strongly modify the universal law of gravity not only in its near surroundings but also in arbitrarily far regions from their location .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that these geometries can be usefull to describe the geodesic motion of actual test particles in an astrophysical situation , like the well known flat galactic rotation curves .",
    "however , this can be considered as a serious posibility only after a study of the stability of these solutions is made .",
    "this , indeed , will be addressed in a future publication .",
