    "the theory of beam - plasma interactions in homogeneous plasmas is one of the pillars of plasma physics , and yet it fails to properly describe some important physical phenomena observed , such as the generation of type iii solar radio bursts or waves registered in the electron foreshock region , upstream of the earth s bow shock @xcite .",
    "the major reason for this discrepancy between observations and the theory of quasilinear , weak or strong turbulence is supposed to be related to the existence of strong density fluctuations that are not associated with the beams . when these fluctuations are large enough , langmuir waves can be trapped or reflected and in both cases the wave - vector @xmath0 of the reflected wave becomes approximately equal and opposite to that of the incident wave @xmath1 .",
    "such strong density fluctuations are not resolved by existing particle detectors .",
    "however , they provide a useful means for inferring the wavelength , which is difficult to measure directly in space plasmas .    the waves instrument @xcite onboard the wind satellite routinely measures langmuir waves at high time resolution ( up to 120000 samples per second ) in the solar wind . when two large amplitude and counter - propagating waves coexist , a monochromatic wave packet with a slowly varying envelope is produced .",
    "some typical examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_example ] . here ,",
    "for the first time , we show how the wavelength of these waves can be directly estimated from a polarization analysis of two components of the electric field .",
    "interestingly , the measured value disagrees with estimates derived from standard beam - plasma theory in homogeneous plasmas but is consistent with estimates derived for strongly inhomogeneous plasmas .",
    "density fluctuations in the solar wind plasma have been studied for many years @xcite and exhibit a power law over many decades .",
    "the smallest scales are difficult to measure by lack of time resolution and counting statistics of standard particle instruments .",
    "recently , @xcite observed the interaction of density fluctuations with langmuir waves , and described them as eigenmodes trapped inside density depletions . in such strongly inhomogeneous plasmas , wave propagation",
    "is strongly affected by density fluctuations . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamics of the instability departs quite substantially from that observed in homogeneous plasmas @xcite .",
    "such density inhomogeneities can cause high frequency electrostatic waves to be converted into electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "they also affect the statistics of wave amplitudes @xcite and the presence of sufficiently large inhomogeneities eventually leads to wave reflection @xcite .     electric field component is shown .",
    "the bottom plot shows a marginal case in which the wave - packet is barely coherent.,width=340 ]    here , we focus on the dynamics of langmuir waves that are generated near the electron foreshock edge region by electron beams with a typical energy of 13kev @xcite .",
    "these waves have a narrowband spectrum and their characteristic frequency is close to the electron plasma frequency .",
    "the presence of relatively large but slowly varying ( with respect to the wavelength ) density fluctuations , with @xmath2 can substantially alter the beam - plasma instability by changing the wave - vector @xmath3 along the trajectory of the beam . here , @xmath3 is the wave - vector of the plasma wave , @xmath4 the background plasma density and @xmath5 is the debye length .",
    "the wave trajectory in the inhomogeneous plasma can be described by the equations @xmath6 that results in a @xmath3-vector change with the density that is described by @xmath7 } \\ ] ]    the observations we present hereafter clearly show the simultaneous presence of two oppositely propagating waves with @xmath3-vectors close to each other , so that @xmath8 .",
    "two scenarios can lead to such a coexistence of primary and oppositely directed secondary waves .",
    "the first one is the scattering off of density fluctuations , and the second one is three - wave decay .",
    "let us consider the first scenario . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume here that the density increases along the x direction . in this case , the @xmath9 component of the wave - vector and the wave group velocity both decrease along x. the wave amplitude then increases even in the absence of growth or damping .",
    "this effect can be illustrated in the wkb approximation , where the solution of the wave equation can be written in the form @xmath10and the amplitude increases when @xmath11 decreases . without damping or growth ,",
    "the component of the energy flux @xmath12 along the density gradient can be supposed to be constant .",
    "we then have @xmath13const and so the wave amplitude @xmath14 scales like @xmath15 . in the wkb approximation , reflection processes are supposed to be similar to mirroring , with part of the energy being reflected and part damped .",
    "two large amplitude waves , incident and backscattered , can thus be observed simultaneously in the vicinity of the reflection point @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the wkb approximation is valid close to , but not at , the turning point where @xmath9 goes to zero . immediately near this point",
    "the wave amplitude resembles solutions of the schrdinger equation with a linearly varying potential expressed in terms of airy functions and it remains finite at the reflection point ( see sect .",
    "17 in @xcite ) .",
    "the second scenario is a change in the characteristics of the wave - wave interaction by a variation of the wave - vector .",
    "the growth of primary waves generated by beam - plasma interactions can be saturated by the decay process @xmath16 , in which a primary langmuir wave @xmath17 decays into a secondary langmuir wave @xmath18 and an ion - sound wave @xmath19 .",
    "the threshold condition for the decay instability is @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the amplitude of the primary wave , @xmath22 is the electron temperature , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the damping rates of the secondary ion sound and langmuir waves , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are their pulsations . when the primary wave propagates into a denser plasma , the decrease in @xmath9 leads to a decrease of the wave - vector of the secondary waves .",
    "the phase velocity of the secondary langmuir wave then grows and the damping rate drops , finally initiating a decay instability .",
    "it is well known from linear theory that the maximum increment of decay instability then corresponds to almost exact back scatter with a small correction to comply with momentum and energy conservation laws . as a consequence , in this case",
    "the wave - vector @xmath0 of the secondary langmuir wave becomes also approximately equal and opposite to that of the primary wave , i.e.  @xmath27 .",
    "these oppositely - directed waves provide a unique opportunity for measuring their wavelength without requiring multipoint measurements .",
    "we assume that the frequency difference @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the frequencies of the incident and reflected waves ) is mainly caused by the doppler shift rather than by the frequency difference associated with the differing dispersions of the two waves .",
    "indeed , this frequency difference significantly exceeds that of the ion - sound wave that might be generated by the decay process . in the spacecraft reference frame ,",
    "the wave frequencies are @xmath31where @xmath32 is the velocity of the plasma with respect to satellite .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 and will check this a posteriori .",
    "theoretical predictions and observations both lend support to the alignment of the wave - vector of the primary ( and consequently secondary ) waves along the magnetic field . since the two wave - vectors have almost equal magnitudes , we find @xmath34 where we suppose that both wave - vectors are approximately co - aligned with the magnetic field . from this expression",
    ", we finally obtain the wavelength @xmath35 .",
    "let us now show how these different quantities are estimated .",
    "in practice , to measure the wavelength of the wave packets , we first need to know their direction of propagation , which is a prerequisite for estimating the wave - vector @xmath3 .",
    "we first convert the electric field components into geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinates , hence defining components @xmath36 and @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_analysis]a .",
    "next , a continuous fourier transform is applied in a small interval around the plasma frequency . except for some distorted wave - packets whose modulation width @xmath22 is only a few oscillation periods , the power spectral density usually exhibits two distinct peaks ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig_analysis]b . the relative width @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the full width at half maximum ) of these peaks is always well below 1% , confirming the stability of the frequency over the interval .",
    "each component of the electric field can then be modeled as a sum of two complex exponentials . a least - squares regression of the following model",
    "is performed @xmath40 \\\\ & + & a_{1,i}(t)\\,{\\rm re}\\left [ \\exp { \\left ( j2\\pi f_{1}t+j\\phi _ { 1,i}(t)\\right ) } \\right ] \\\\ & + & c_{i}(t)+\\epsilon _ { i}(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 or @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the residual error to be minimized . the amplitude @xmath44 and the phase @xmath45 vary slowly with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "possible offsets are taken care of by a small and slowly varying constant @xmath46 .",
    "we use a sliding gaussian window of width @xmath47 to estimate these parameters at different parts of the wave - packet .",
    "obviously , we must have @xmath48 .",
    "taking @xmath49 was found to be a good compromise .",
    "we checked that the amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 show no beating like the original wave packets do ( fig .",
    "[ fig_analysis]c ) and that the phases @xmath52 and @xmath53 indeed vary slowly with respect to the wave period .    once the amplitudes and the phases are known , we can separate the components of the electric field corresponding to the primary and secondary waves .",
    "a plot in polar coordinates ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_analysis]d ) reveals their polarisation in the xy - plane .",
    "also shown are the projection on that plane of the magnetic field @xmath54 and the solar wind velocity @xmath55 . for electrostatic waves , @xmath56 and",
    "so the direction of the wave - vector @xmath3 should be given by the semi - major axis of the polarisation ellipse .",
    "figure  [ fig_analysis]d shows two remarkable results , which are systematically found for all the coherent wave - packets we analyzed .",
    "first , both waves are almost linearly polarized and their polarisation ellipses have the same orientation .",
    "we conclude that their wave - vectors are necessarily parallel or antiparallel , as expected .",
    "secondly , the angle between the semi - major axis of the polarisation ellipse and the ambient magnetic field is always small , rarely exceeding 20@xmath57 .",
    "the absence of the third @xmath58 component in principle prevents us from concluding that @xmath59 .",
    "for all the events we analyzed , however , we always found the polarisation ellipse to be parallel to the magnetic field , no matter how the latter is oriented .",
    "we therefore conclude that both waves must necessarily propagate along or very close to the magnetic field direction .",
    "momentum conservation finally implies @xmath60 .        for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_analysis ] , we measure @xmath61hz , @xmath62khz and so from eq .",
    "( [ eq_themodel ] ) we finally obtain the wavelength @xmath63 km .",
    "we check that the waves are indeed weakly dispersive , since from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersionless ] ) we have @xmath64 similar values are obtained for the other coherent wave packets shown in fig .  1 , except for the last one , for which @xmath65 and @xmath66 can not be properly identified",
    ". we analyzed 644 wave - packets that way and found the wavelength to be on average @xmath67 km , with a standard deviation of 0.5 km ; the typical debye length in the solar wind at 1au is 10 m .",
    "the coherent wave packets we observe always coincide with an enhancement in the energetic electron flux .",
    "the energy of these electrons ranges from several hundreds of ev up to several kev .",
    "figure  [ fig_electron_flux ] shows the energetic electron flux measured by wind during a typical burst of langmuir wave activity . @xcite",
    "have shown that these wave packets are associated with _ bump on tail _ features in the electron distribution .",
    "their wavelength then should be @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the beam velocity . for waves with a frequency of 20khz that are generated by 1kev electron beams , we find @xmath70 m . this value is about 2.3 times smaller than the one we measure .",
    "the two values can not be reconciled by assuming that the wave activity is triggered by higher energy energy electrons , since unrealistic energies in excess of 5kev would be required .",
    "the wavelength we observe , however , is compatible with that found for wave propagation in inhomogeneous plasma . as it was pointed out by @xcite from the analysis of the density fluctuation spectra , variations in the @xmath3-vector , as caused by density fluctuations , can exceed the vector magnitude .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy we observe between the predicted and observed wavelengths is most probably due to a change of the wave - vector when the waves propagate into a higher density region . indeed , for the solar wind conditions we consider , the variation of the wave dispersion can be as large as @xmath71 the associated level of density variations is @xmath72 such levels are compatible with estimates made at the electron foreshock @xcite and are large enough to offer an explanation for the relatively large wavelengths we observe .",
    "our conclusion is further supported by recent direct observations by @xcite and @xcite of unusually high levels of density fluctuations in the solar wind .",
    "the conventional theory of beam - plasma interaction that has been developed for homogeneous plasmas does not apply to such cases .",
    "indeed , our results show in an unambiguous way that the observed wavelengths exceed their theoretical prediction .",
    "the theory should therefore include the effect of large amplitude random density fluctuations from the very beginning .",
