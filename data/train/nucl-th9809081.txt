    "the core of a massive star becomes dynamically unstable when it exhausts its nuclear fuel .",

    "_ @xcite the collapse is very sensitive to the entropy and to the number of leptons per baryon , @xmath3 . in the early stage of the collapse @xmath3",

    ", fuller _ et al . _",
    "( usually called ffn ) have systematically estimated the rates for nuclei in the mass range @xmath4 putting special emphasis on the importance of capture to the gamow - teller ( gt ) giant resonance @xcite .",
    "the gt contribution to the rate has been parametrized by ffn on the basis of the independent particle model . to complete the ffn rate estimate ,",
    "the gt contribution has been supplemented by a contribution simulating low - lying transitions .",
    "recently the ffn rates have been updated and extended to heavier nuclei by aufderheide _",
    "these authors also considered the wellknown quenching of the gamow - teller strength by reducing the independent particle estimate for the gt resonance contribution by a common factor of two .",
    "after experimental ( n , p ) data clearly indicated that the gamow - teller strength is not only quenched ( usually by more than a factor 2 compared to the independent particle model ) , but also fragmented over several states at modest excitation energies in the daughter nucleus @xcite , the need for an improved theoretical description has soon been realized @xcite .",
    "these studies have been performed within the conventional shell model diagonalization approach , however , in strongly restricted model spaces and with residual interactions , which turned out to neither reproduce the quenching nor the position of the gt strength sufficiently well .",
    "these model studies therefore had only a limited value , as they required experimental input informations , and they had no predictive power .",
    "this situation changed recently as the development of the shell model monte carlo technique ( smmc ) @xcite allows calculations of the gt strength distribution in the complete @xmath2 shell .",
    "in fact , using the kb3 residual interaction @xcite it has been demonstrated that both the quenching of the gt strength @xcite and its distribution @xcite can be well reproduced . using the smmc method , dean _ et al . _",
    "have recently calculated electron capture rates for several fe peak nuclei of importance at the early stage of the presupernova collapse @xcite .",
    "this calculation indicated systematic differences in the location of the main gt resonance strength compared to the parametrization of ffn . in capture on even - even nuclei the gt strength resides at lower excitation energies in the daughter than assumed by ffn , while in odd - a nuclei the gt strength is centered at higher excitation energies .",
    "the same trend is also seen in the available ( n , p ) data @xcite and has been pointed out for individual cases in @xcite .    ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that , for even - even parent nuclei , the electron capture rates are given by the bulk of the gamow - teller strength distribution , which resides at low excitation energies in the daughter , and is well reproduced by the smmc method .",
    "the situation is quite different in odd - a nuclei .",
    "here the bulk of the gt strength is at a too high excitation energy to be of significance for the electron capture rates which are dominated by weak low - lying transitions .",
    "unfortunately the smmc method is not capable of spectroscopy and does not allow to extract these weak transition strengths .",
    "these informations , however , can be obtained from shell model diagonalizations techniques which have made significant progress in the last couple of years to allow now for basically complete @xmath2 shell diagonalizations for low - lying states in the @xmath5 mass range @xcite .",
    "aufderheide _ et al .",
    "_ have ranked the core nuclei with respect to their importance for the electron capture process in the presupernova @xcite .",
    "as the two most important nuclei these authors identified @xmath0co and @xmath1ni for the early presupernova collapse . both rates , however , should be strongly affected by the misplacement of the gt resonance position . a new estimate for the capture rate on @xmath1ni has already been given in @xcite based on an smmc calculation , however , this rate has been cautioned by the authors due to possible oberbinding effects at the @xmath6 shell closure in their approach . due to their importance a calculation of the two rates on the basis of",
    "a shell model diagonalization approach seems to be quite useful .",
    "we have performed such a calculation for the @xmath1ni ground state and the 3 lowest states in @xmath0co using the kb3 interaction @xcite and making use of the state - of - the - art diagonalization code antoine @xcite .",
    "it is wellknown that @xmath7 shell model calculations , i.e. calculations performed in one major shell , overestimate the gt strength by a universal factor @xmath8 @xcite , often interpreted as a renormalization of the axialvector coupling constant @xmath9 in nuclei . to account for this fact",
    ", we have used the renormalized value @xmath10 in the following ..    for @xmath1ni we have calculated the total gt strength in a full @xmath2 shell calculation , resulting in b(gt)=@xmath11 ( see also @xcite ) , which is in agreement with the smmc value ( b(gt)=@xmath12 @xcite ) .",
    "the independent particle model yields b(gt)=@xmath13 .",
    "the gt strength distribution has been calculated in a model space which allowed a maximum of 6 particles to be excited from the @xmath14 shell to the rest of the @xmath2-shell in the final nucleus , @xmath1co .",
    "the @xmath15-scheme dimension of this calculation is 19831538 . in this truncated calculation",
    "we obtain a total gt strength of @xmath16 , indicating that our calculation is almost converged at this truncation level ( see also @xcite ) . for @xmath0co",
    "we have calculated the total gt strength and the distribution in a truncated calculation which fulfills the ikeda sum rule and in which maximally 5 particles in the final nucleus are allowed to be excited out of the @xmath14 orbital .",
    "we obtain a total gt strength of @xmath17 from the ground state of @xmath0co , and @xmath18 from both of the excited @xmath19 states .",
    "the values are to be compared with the independent particle value of b(gt)=@xmath20 .",
    "we note that for both , @xmath0co and @xmath1ni , the quenching factor is unusually small due to the shell closure at @xmath1ni .",
    "we have performed 33 lanczos iterations which are usually sufficient to converge in the states at excitation energies below @xmath21 mev . at higher excitation energies , @xmath22 mev ,",
    "the calculated gt strengths represent centroids of strengths , which in reality are splitted over many states . for calculating the electron capture rate , however , a resolution of this strength at higher energies",
    "is unimportant .",
    "the gt strength distributions @xmath23 for the lowest states in @xmath0co ( @xmath24 ground state and the two @xmath19 excited states at @xmath25 mev and 2.565 mev , respectively ) and for the @xmath1ni ground state are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the energy scale in these figures has been adjusted such that the lowest calculated state of a given angular momentum agrees with the experimentally known excitation energy ; the necessary energy shifts have been less than 300 kev as the shell model calculations reproduce the low - lying spectrum in @xmath0fe and @xmath1co rather well .",
    "we observe that for the @xmath0co ground state the gt centroid resides at about @xmath26 mev in the daughter @xmath0fe , while it is at around @xmath27 mev for the excited states .",
    "this result is in agreement with the smmc study ( performed at temperature @xmath28 mev ) which found the centroid of the gt strength at @xmath29 mev in @xmath0fe @xcite .    to estimate the electron capture rates at finite temperatures ,",
    "the compilations employed the so - called brink hypothesis @xcite- assuming that the gt strength distribution on excited states is the same as for the ground state , only shifted by the excitation energy of the state . for @xmath0co",
    "this assumption is roughly valid for the bulk of the strength , but it is clearly not justified for the low - lying transitions which are dominated by the individual structures of the states involved . while the @xmath0co ground state has rather weak gt transitions to low - lying states in @xmath0fe , the first excited @xmath19 state has a strong transition to the @xmath0fe ground state ( and first excited state ) .",
    "the quality of our calculation can be tested by calculating the lifetime of @xmath0co under terrestrial conditions where it decays by @xmath30-decay . using the gt matrix elements",
    "as calculated in our shell model approach and the experimental energy splittings we calculate a @xmath0co lifetime of 16.7 hours , which compares nicely with the experimental value of 17.53 hours .    under presupernova conditions",
    "the electron capture on @xmath1ni is dominated by the ground state as the first excited state is too high in excitation energy .",
    "the centroid of the gt strength is around @xmath31 mev in @xmath1co , in agreement with the smmc estimate given in ref .",
    "for comparison , ffn placed the gt resonance in @xmath1co at e=3.8 mev . for the lifetime of @xmath1ni",
    "we find 6.7 d , very close to the experimental value of 6.08 d.        where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the electron energy , momentum , and chemical potential , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and 0 otherwise .",

    "g is the partition function , @xmath41}$ ] .",
    "the fermi function @xmath42 accounts for the distortion of the electron s wave function due to the coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "the calculated electron capture rates for @xmath0co and @xmath1ni are shown in figs . 3 and 4 as function of temperature",
    "( @xmath43 measures the temperature in @xmath44 k ) and for selected densities ( @xmath45 measures the density in @xmath46 g/@xmath47 ) . for the chemical potential",
    "we use the approximation @xcite @xmath48^{-1/3}\\;.\\ ] ] due to the ranking given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0co and @xmath1ni are the most important electron capture nuclei at temperatures and densities around @xmath49 and @xmath50 . under these conditions the recommended capture rates ( the ffn rates are in parenthesis ) for @xmath0co and @xmath1ni are @xcite @xmath51= @xmath52 s@xmath53 ( @xmath54 s@xmath53 ) and @xmath55 s@xmath53 ( @xmath56 s@xmath53 ) , respectively , while our calculation yields @xmath57 s@xmath53 for @xmath0co and @xmath58 s@xmath53 for @xmath1ni .",
    "for @xmath1ni the three rates agree rather well , but this agreement is more or less accidental as a closer inspection shows . in the calculation of @xcite",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the transition to the low - lying states ( simulated for all nuclei by an effective b(gt)=0.1 for a transition to a fictitious state at @xmath59 ) , while only @xmath60 originates from the gt resonance placed at @xmath61 mev .",
    "we , however , find that nearly @xmath62 of the capture rate is due to the strong transition to the gt resonance , which in our calculation is located nearly 1 mev lower in excitation energy than parametrized in refs .",
    "our @xmath1ni rate also approximately agrees with the smmc estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as already suggested in @xcite the recommended rate for @xmath0co is too large ( by more than an order of magnitude ) , as the authors of @xcite placed the gt resonance at too low an excitation energy and consequently assigned 73@xmath63 and 83@xmath63 , respectively , to this transition .",
    "in contrast , our calculated rate is predominantly given by transitions to the low - lying states .",
    "in fact , we recover about 80@xmath63 of the rate if we cut the calculated gt spectra at the excitation energy @xmath64 mev .",
    "we also note that the @xmath0co rate arises mainly from capture on the ground state at temperatures @xmath65 ( which are typical for presupernova electron capture on @xmath0co ) , while , due to the rather large excitation energies , contributions from capture on the excited states amount to less than @xmath66 under the relevant presupernova conditions .    in summary , we have performed state - of - the - art large - scale shell model diagonalization calculations to determine the presupernova electron capture rates on @xmath0co and @xmath1ni , which are believed to be the most important `` electron poisons '' at the onset of collapse .",
    "although our calculation approximately agrees with the recommended rate for @xmath1ni , it does not confirm the parametrization conventionally used to derive at these rates .",
    "our calculation finds the bulk of the gt strength distribution at around 1 mev lower in excitation energy than assumed in the parametrization .",
    "as has already been noted before @xcite this trend seems to be general for even - even parent nuclei , while for odd - a nuclei the parametrization places the gt centroid at too low excitation energies .",
    "this suggestion @xcite is confirmed in our shell model calculation .",
    "in fact we find that the centroid is too high in excitation energy to affect noticeably the electron capture rate under presupernova conditions . consequently our calculated rate is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the compiled rates @xcite .",
    "what are the consequences for the presupernova collapse ? at the onset of collapse ( @xmath67 ) the change of @xmath3 with time,@xmath68 , has been assumed to be predominantly due to electron capture on @xmath0co ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath1ni ( @xmath69 ) @xcite . with our revised rates",
    ", @xmath1ni becomes the dominant source for electron capture and @xmath68 is reduced by nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "however , for firm conclusions it appears to be reasonable to first update the electron capture rates on all important nuclei and then to perform a simulation of the presupernova collapse .",
