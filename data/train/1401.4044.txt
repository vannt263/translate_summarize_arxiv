    "the tight - binding model contains two spin degenerate orbitals with a hamiltonian @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the five dirac matrices obeying the clifford algebra @xmath126 , @xmath127 are the ten commutators @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "specifically , we take the following basis of the @xmath62-matrices @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 being the standard pauli matrices acting in the spin and orbital space , respectively ; @xmath132 with @xmath133 as the @xmath134 unity matrices .    the explicit form of the hamiltonian is then determined by exploiting the symmetries . for the tight - binding model we assume a well - defined parity , in addition to time - reversal symmetry",
    ". time - reversal symmetry is represented by the operator @xmath135 , with @xmath136 and @xmath137 as complex conjugation , while the parity operator is @xmath138 . as the commutators @xmath127 transform under time - reversal and parity with the opposite sign , the assumption of having both these symmetries thus results in @xmath139 in eq .  .",
    "the remaining functions @xmath140 of the effective model can then be obtained from the theory of invariants .",
    "let us consider the space group @xmath59 with the point group @xmath55 .",
    "this point group has two one - dimensional , one two - dimensional and two three - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "the matrix @xmath141 anticommutes with the @xmath62-matrices @xmath142 and therefore represents the mass term , which is by construction even under the parity .",
    "the corresponding mass term has to be rotationally - symmetric and therefore an even polynomial in the momentum @xmath61 .",
    "using also that the @xmath62-matrices @xmath142 form a three - dimensional representation under rotations in @xmath55 , we arrive at the following minimal continuum hamiltonian that captures topologically nontrivial phases @xmath143 with @xmath144 and we dropped the term @xmath145 not relevant for the topological analysis here .",
    "this hamiltonian generalizes the 2d bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) to three dimensions ( 3d ) and its different incarnations have already been used to describe topological states in bismuth - based compounds [ s1 ] .    let us subsequently determine the lattice - regularized version of the effective model . considering a simple cubic lattice with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hoppings , we obtain the following tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath146 with the effective mass parameter @xmath147 we set the lattice constant @xmath148 , and the parameters @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) represent hopping amplitudes between different ( same ) orbitals , while @xmath67 is the difference of the onsite energies between the two orbitals , similar as in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bhz model .",
    "the hoppings in the hamiltonian ( [ eq::hamtb ] ) are equal in the three orthogonal directions due to the rotational symmetry .",
    "the above hamiltonian reduces to the continuum hamiltonian when expanded around the @xmath7 or the @xmath68-point located at the momentum @xmath149 in the brillouin zone ( bz ) . additionally , in order to enrich the phase diagram",
    ", we add next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms in the exact same fashion as the nearest - neighbor ones .",

    "s1 .    by lowering the full rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq::hamtb ] ) ,",

    "as function of the parameter @xmath154 and the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath155 the mass parameter at the time - reversal invariant momenta can be tuned to produce the different electronic topological configurations as shown in the figure . ]",
    "let us now consider the effect of dislocations in the coarse - grained continuum theory obtained from the tight - binding model introduced in the previous section .",
    "such lattice defects are described within the elastic continuum theory using vielbeins , encoding the map from the perfect lattice to the distorted lattice [ s3 ] .",
    "the torsion @xmath158 and curvature @xmath159 are then related to the vielbeins @xmath160 and the spin connection @xmath161 by the einstein - cartan structure equations",
    "@xmath162 for a dislocation defect , the curvature vanishes while the torsion is singular , @xmath163 with @xmath164 as the burgers vector and @xmath165 as the position of the dislocation line .",
    "since curvature tensor vanishes for a dislocation , the corresponding spin - connection can be set to zero .      in case of an edge dislocation oriented along the @xmath166-direction",
    ", the vielbein takes the form @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the magnitude of the burgers vector @xmath169 , which is assumed to be along the @xmath170-direction @xmath171 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the inverse of the above vielbein is readily found to be @xmath172 since for an elementary dislocation @xmath173 with @xmath23 as the lattice constant , the distortion field @xmath174 to the leading order in @xmath35 is then readily obtained @xmath175 the corresponding gauge potential @xmath176 , with @xmath3 as the band - inversion momentum , can be then straightforwardly obtained and is given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the main text .    we can now consider the effect of an edge dislocation in a 3d topological insulator .",
    "we note that along the core of the dislocation translational symmetry is preserved .",
    "henceforth , @xmath177 is a good quantum number and we obtain a family of two - dimensional hamiltonians @xmath178 the dimensionally - reduced hamiltonian @xmath179 can then be treated using well - known methods [ s2,s4 ] .",
    "hence , we can determine the spectrum of dislocation modes directly .",
    "we now make this more concrete for the model with the hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that the system is in the @xmath69 or @xmath68 phase [ s6 ] as shown in fig .",

    "let us first neglect the last term in the hamiltonian @xmath186 . in the remaining hamiltonian",
    "the term @xmath187 plays the role of the effective mass in the two - dimensional bhz model .",
    "therefore , this hamiltonian hosts zero modes for the values of the parameters @xmath188 obeying @xmath189 . now , take @xmath78 . then , as @xmath190 , it follows that @xmath191 , which is precisely the condition for a zero mode solution bound to the dislocation .",
    "the solution of eq .   without the last term @xmath79 has been derived and discussed in detail in refs .",
    "[ s2,s4 ] .",
    "more specifically , in this parameter range the system entails the @xmath192 or @xmath75 phase in the reduced 2d hamiltonian .",
    "similarly , the next @xmath177 value in a finite system results in a dislocation mode if the effective mass @xmath193 still satisfies the topological condition @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , we can exactly determine the corresponding spectrum by reintroducing the last term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq::2d ] ) , @xmath194 .",
    "since @xmath195 commutes with the hamiltonian and @xmath196 anticommutes with the other @xmath62-matrices in the hamiltonian , the term @xmath197 acts as a mass term for the modes comprising zero - energy subspace in its absence .",
    "the corresponding gap is thus @xmath198 with respect to the zero energy , and in the thermodynamic limit these midgap modes are linearly dispersing along the dislocation line with the velocity set by the hopping in this direction , in agreement with the @xmath80 rule .",
    "these conclusions are schematically shown in fig .",
    "s2 . by displaying the allowed values of @xmath195 in a finite system , @xmath199 , with @xmath200 and @xmath201 , on the unit circle in the imaginary plane",
    ", the real part characterizes the effective @xmath202 , while the imaginary part signals the anticipated energy of the dislocation mode .",
    "we note that the shift in @xmath203 indeed ensures that the @xmath69 phase hosts no dislocation modes with @xmath204 and in the thermodynamic limit all the propagating modes indeed descend from the zero modes at the band - inversion momentum @xmath149 , as expected from the @xmath80 rule .",
    "the above analytical results can easily be verified by numerical computations , and the two show an excellent agreement . in fig .",
    "s3 we show the spectrum of a @xmath205 system on a torus ( periodic boundary conditions ) and the real space localization of the dislocation modes .",
    "we note that the modes are neatly localized and come as two kramers pairs , one from the dislocation and one from the anti - dislocation .",
    "moreover , since @xmath206 takes values in the set comprising of the twelfth roots of unity , we can compare the energy gaps with the anticipated @xmath207 dependence and find agreement up to two decimals .",
    "in addition , we change the mass parameter @xmath67 to confirm that modes can be added or removed from the spectrum consistent with the condition in eq .  ,",
    "these results reproduce for various sizes of the system ( ranging up to 16 sites in length ) , confirming the presence of the zero mode together with the descendant propagating states , as predicted by the @xmath80 rule . furthermore ,",
    "when the next - nearest neighbor hoppings are included , the phase @xmath208 protected by both trs and crystal symmetries with the band inversions at the momenta @xmath209 , and @xmath210 can be realized , see fig .",
    "s1 . in that case , a dislocation with burgers vector @xmath211 and oriented along the @xmath13 axis , @xmath212 , in both planes @xmath87 and @xmath78 acts as @xmath74-flux , and thus a double kramers pair is expected .",
    "this is indeed what we find numerically , see fig .",
    "s5 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the explained reasoning to other phases .",
    "let us illustrate this with the primitive tetragonal system taking @xmath213 and @xmath214 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tetragonal ] ) . for these parameters",
    "we obtain the weak @xmath93 phase with band - inversions at @xmath75 and @xmath68 points .",
    "this phase is displayed in fig .",
    "s6 , and is not protected by either time - reversal symmetry or 3d space group symmetry , as opposed to a valley phase . by inserting an edge dislocation with @xmath215 and @xmath216 we see that both time - reversal invariant planes orthogonal to @xmath217 are topologically nontrivial and thus yield zero modes , which in turn produce descendant propagating modes along the dislocation .",
    "we find the propagating modes numerically for the systems with @xmath218 and a @xmath205 sites , see fig .",
    "s6 , and with the plot of the spectral weight of the dislocation modes shown in fig .",
    "notice the doubling of the dirac cone since in this phase there are two nontrivial topologically nontrivial planes orthogonal to the dislocation line each yielding a @xmath74 flux .",
    "in turn , this nontrivial flux produces a double kramers pair of the zero modes , which yields descendent propagating states along the dislocation defect .              in three dimensions",
    "the burgers vector can also be oriented parallel to the dislocation line .",
    "in contrast to the edge dislocation , which is essentially a 2d defect pulled out in the third dimension , the resulting screw dislocation is an intrinsic 3d defect . for a screw dislocation with the burgers vector oriented along the @xmath166-axis , @xmath219 ,",
    "the vielbeins are given by @xmath220 and @xmath221 the corresponding distortion field , taking into account that for an elementary dislocation @xmath173 , is then given by @xmath222 and the gauge potential is given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the main text .",
    "we note for a screw dislocation , the gauge potential can only be finite if @xmath223 . in the case of a screw dislocation",
    ", @xmath177 is still a good quantum number , and henceforth we find the same equation for the zero - energy modes and the corresponding descendant states . in figs .",
    "s8 and s9 , we present the numerical analysis of the spectrum of the hamiltonian in the @xmath224 phase in the presence of a screw dislocation .",
    "we obtain in essence the same spectrum as for the edge dislocation . for various system sizes ,",
    "we find precisely the number of dislocation modes in the spectrum according to the topological condition below eq . .",
    "also , we find that the energy difference between the levels is proportional with the @xmath225 coefficient .",
    "we do find however that the energy levels have shifted as compared with the ones obtained in the presence of an edge dislocation in the same phase . tuning the mass parameter @xmath226 deeper into the phase , ( closer to the value of this parameter @xmath227 ) results in levels closer to the analytically calculated value , as expected from the finite - size effects , and the fact that the matrix elements are now twisted with a factor @xmath228 along the dislocation direction .",
    "we observe in addition that , in general , the form of the underlying metric @xmath229 may be mapped with @xmath230 to a flat space with nontrivial quasi - periodic boundary conditions , which indeed result in energy shifts , which we do not explicitly compute here but this in principle can be done using the outlined procedure .    in the translationally active @xmath231 phase ,",
    "obtained from the hamiltonian and for the values of the parameters as shown in fig .",
    "s1 , a screw dislocation with the burgers vector @xmath101 produces @xmath74 fluxes in the plane @xmath89 , which hosts a valley phase . therefore , according to the @xmath0 rule , we expect two kramers pairs of the dislocation modes originating from the band - inversion at the @xmath75 and the @xmath88 points .",
    "our numerical computations indeed confirm this prediction , as shown in fig .",
    "s10 .",
    "let us now consider a dislocation loop , which can be thought of as a connected channel of screw and edge dislocations .",
    "although the burgers vector @xmath169 of any dislocation remains constant [ s7 ] , the planes orthogonal to the dislocation line are different for the edge and screw dislocation part of the circuit . in general",
    "one can consider the full scattering problem of an edge and screw dislocation [ s8,s9 ] , which essentially pertains to matching the phases of the solutions of eq .  .",
    "due to time - reversal symmetry , however , the helical modes do not backscatter , and we can thus conclude that dislocation loops have helical modes along the core when both the edge and the screw dislocation possess the propagating modes .",
    "we note that this implies that the existence of the dislocation modes in the loop is also dictated by the @xmath0 rule .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath69 phase with a dislocation loop , see fig s2 . , has dislocation modes along the loop for any orientation of the burgers vector @xmath169 .",
    "in contrast , inserting a dislocation loop in the @xmath232 plane , with @xmath71 , in the @xmath93 phase shown in fig .",
    "s6 only binds dislocation modes to the edge dislocation part of the circuit , resulting in the exact same spectrum shown in fig .",
    "changing the orientation of the burgers vector to @xmath233 then does result in dislocation modes along the loop , as the gauge potential @xmath234 is nontrivial in all the planes normal to the dislocation lines and these planes are topologically nontrivial . at last , changing the burgers vector to the @xmath235 direction , it is evident that the effective systems in each plane either has no flux or acquires @xmath236-flux . as a result we anticipate no modes , analogously to the case of a screw dislocation with @xmath101 .",
    "the latter is confirmed by numerical computations , see fig .",
    "s11c .    finally , we address the full compatibility of the outlined analysis with the underlying characterization of topological insulators with different space groups in terms of the band - inversions .",
    "consider , for example , the composite phase @xmath237 , which is equivalent to the @xmath238 or @xmath239 phase with the dislocation loop in the @xmath240 plane , as previously described , see fig .",
    "we expect here the response of the dislocations to be the same with both choices of the band - inversions .",
    "we see that applying the @xmath0 rule to either set of the band inversions produces the same outcome in terms of the fluxes acting on the planes . along the edge dislocation ,",
    "the @xmath204 plane hosts a @xmath74 flux , in contrast to the @xmath73 plane .",
    "similarly , for the screw dislocation part , which has momentum in the @xmath241 direction , we see that the @xmath242 plane hosts a zero mode .",
    "note that in the latter case , the screw dislocation acts as a @xmath74-flux in the phase , which with respect to the @xmath89 plane , may be thought of as the @xmath243 or @xmath7 phase , since the @xmath244 momentum acts as a @xmath7 point in this plane .",
    "the descendant values of @xmath241 thus contribute dislocation modes to the spectrum as long as the effective @xmath226 parameter in the reduced model is in the range corresponding to the @xmath243 in 2d . as result",
    ", we find that the complete dislocation loop has modes along the core .",

    "<S> we expect that the stability of the dislocation modes in 3d tbis against a time - reversal invariant disorder is in one - to - one correspondence with the stability of the 2d topological phase yielding the helical modes . therefore , the most stable dislocation modes should originate from a 2d @xmath58phase , followed by the ones arising from translationally - active and crystalline phases @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> these general statements can be illustrated by a simple tight - binding model with two orbitals with different parity and two spin states @xcite on the simple cubic lattice with space group @xmath59 @xmath60 with @xmath61 as the electron momentum , the @xmath62-matrices acting in the orbital and the spin spaces , and we use natural units ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> topological phases of the model can be tuned with the mass term @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath65(@xmath66 ) are related to the inter-(intra-)orbital hoppings , and @xmath67 is related to the difference in the onsite energies for different orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the system is in an @xmath68-phase ( labeled @xmath69 in ref .  ) , which is characterized by a band - inversion at the @xmath68 point [ momentum @xmath70 in the bz , ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath73 plane reduces to the @xmath74 flux problem in the two - dimensional @xmath75-phase ( labeled @xmath76 in ref .  ) , which is defined by the band - inversion at the @xmath75 point , and hence possesses zero modes . for the family of hamiltonians then any momentum @xmath77 infinitesimally close to @xmath78 yields the would - be zero modes in the absence of the term @xmath79 . when included , this term gives rise to the linearly dispersing propagating modes along the dislocation line , according to the above @xmath80 rule . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the same rule implies that an edge or a screw dislocation along any bravais lattice vector in the simple cubic lattice effectively acts as a @xmath74 flux . </S>",
    "<S> hence , when these defects are joined in a loop in the @xmath81-plane with @xmath71 , we expect propagating modes , which are indeed found in our numerical computations . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , trs together with the crystal symmetry protects the modes from backscattering .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the system in the three - dimensional @xmath75-phase [ @xmath82 , characterized by band - inversions located at the momenta @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , which are related by the threefold rotational symmetry ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1b , and s5 and s10 in the supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to the @xmath86 rule , for the edge - segment of the dislocation loop , @xmath87 and @xmath78 planes both host a @xmath74 flux , originating from the @xmath75 and @xmath88 points . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the @xmath89 plane hosts a two - dimensional crystalline phase , and thus the screw - dislocation parts also host two pairs of modes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a total of two kramers pairs of gapless dislocation modes along the loop , which are _ protected by symmetry_. note that their existence crucially depends on the fact that the @xmath75 and @xmath88 momenta are symmetry - related . were this not the case </S>",
    "<S> , the weak index of this @xmath90 phase , @xmath91 , would predict no dislocation modes at all .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , let us now break the cubic symmetry by considering the @xmath92-phase ( @xmath93 ) on a tetragonal lattice with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the lattice constant in the direction @xmath17 , and @xmath97 is the lattice deformation parameter ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1c and 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice here also a subtle difference between such a weak phase and a crystalline ( valley ) phase , which has an even number of band - inversions _ protected _ by a 3d space group symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the usual strong and weak indices @xcite in this phase are @xmath98 , and thus @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the @xmath87 and @xmath100 planes are topologically nontrivial therein ( fig . 1 and @xcite ) . as a result , for a dislocation loop with @xmath101 , according to the @xmath102 rule , we find modes bound only to the edge - dislocation parts . as both </S>",
    "<S> these planes contribute the midgap states , we expect a double kramers pair of the propagating metallic states , which our numerical computations indeed confirm . however , these modes can mix in the dislocation loop , since no symmetry relates the momenta @xmath75 and @xmath68 giving rise to them .    finally , we consider the tetragonal @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) phase obtained by deforming the cubic lattice in the @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) direction with the corresponding band - inversions at @xmath107 @xmath108 $ ] and @xmath109 @xmath110 $ ] momenta ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> no dislocation modes appear in the * @xmath103 * phase , whereas in the * @xmath104 * phase only the band - inversion at momentum @xmath111 contributes a @xmath74 flux , thus yielding the modes for both types of dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> these results are therefore similar as in the @xmath112-phase on the cubic lattice , as also confirmed by numerical computations showing modes propagating along the entire loop in the @xmath81 plane . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difference is that not all directions are equivalent here , and hence velocities of the modes along the loop are anisotropic .    </S>",
    "<S> the response of dislocations in tbis is experimentally consequential as these defects are ubiquitous in any crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - doped mixed - valent perovskite oxide @xmath113 with a simple cubic crystal symmetry has been recently predicted to be a tbi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the topological phase is believed to be the symmetric @xmath68-phase [ @xmath69 ] , which should host propagating gapless modes along any dislocation loop , as we have found here . </S>",
    "<S> the effective tight - binding model describes this phase with the parameters @xmath115ev@xmath116 , @xmath117ev@xmath116@xmath118 , @xmath119ev , and the lattice constant @xmath120   @xcite , implying that the velocity of the dislocation modes is @xmath121 m/s , while the localization length @xmath122   @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the enhanced density of states near the dislocation line in a non-@xmath7 tbi @xcite should be observable by local probes , such as scanning tunnelling microscopy , where the dislocation reaches the crystal surface . </S>",
    "<S> the surface states hybridize with the dislocation modes , and the precise local redistribution of the increased density of states can be modeled for the specific experimental situation using our theory . </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy may also be useful for mapping out these states , since the surface irregularities should not affect this probe .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our findings will motivate further studies of the role of dislocations in tbis with different crystal symmetries , and especially their knotting which should play the role of braiding for these topological defects and might be relevant for quantum computation . finally , our results based on the `` intuitive '' classification of the dislocations through the burgers vectors ultimately call for a mathematically precise characterization of these defects in terms of the homotopy classes for the discrete space groups .    _ </S>",
    "<S> note added . _ recently , we became aware of the work by shiozaki and sato @xcite , where the response of dislocations in 3d tbis was studied using @xmath123theory .    </S>",
