    "<S> dashed vertical lines indicate the corresponding fixed centroid positions.,width=311 ]    [ fig : rate ] reveals two main effects from the quantum treatment of nuclei in pimd . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the crossover to tunneling - dominated diffusion is reflected by the changes in the pimd rate , with a gradual change of slope in the arrhenius plot below 100  k. secondly , at intermediate to high temperatures the gradient from pimd agrees well with the experiment due to the decrease of the quantum free energy barrier and the inclusion of zpe effects , highlighting the importance of quantum nuclear effects even at high temperatures . indeed , fitting the same arrhenius expression to the pimd results as used for the experimental rates we obtain @xmath26  mev , close to the experimental value of 95  mev . </S>",
    "<S> however , pimd gives a larger prefactor than the experiment resulting in rates faster by around a factor of 4 at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely to be due to the use of the classical velocity in the expression for the rate ( see experimental methods ) . to illustrate the agreement between the experimental and pimd gradients at high temperatures we show in the inset of [ fig : rate ] theoretical rates that have been scaled by 0.25 .    </S>",
    "<S> despite the overall qualitative agreement with experiment , it is apparent that at low temperatures the pimd results underestimate the experimental rate by 23 orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this could potentially be explained by the difference between the calculated and experimental estimates of the fcc - hcp energy difference and activation energy . to investigate this discrepancy in the low temperature rates we use a more flexible and computationally efficient approach than pimd , specifically instanton theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the instanton calculations we used a 1d potential represented by a polynomial fitted to the underlying dft potential energy surface along the fcc - hcp diffusion path . </S>",
    "<S> initially we validated the instanton calculations by comparing the rates it produced with those from pimd , and as shown in the low temperature region of [ fig : rate ] the instanton and pimd results agree quite well . by construction , instantons only provide rates in the tunneling regime . using the instanton approach we then investigated the sensitivity of the computed rates to the fcc - hcp energy difference . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we modified the 1d dft potential by reducing the activation energy and hence also the fcc - hcp energy difference by 25  mev , bringing the binding site energy difference into close agreement with the experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines in [ fig : rate ] show instanton rates for this modified potential . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , significantly better agreement with the low - temperature experimental rates is now seen . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller gradient , due to the smaller fcc - hcp energy difference and thus smaller lattice deformation energy required for energy coincidence between fcc and hcp vibrational states , agrees better with the nearly temperature independent experimental rate , and the magnitude of tunneling is strongly enhanced by the small reduction in the activation energy . </S>",
    "<S> these results highlight the large sensitivity of computed jump rates on details of the pes , and hence the importance of performing accurate calculations . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the rather good agreement between instanton calculations and pimd rates on the unmodified pes show that polaron effects play a minor role on this surface , in agreement with the experimental observation of low adsorbate - surface friction .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a combined experimental and theoretical study of the diffusion of h on ru(0001 ) , showing a transition from overbarrier hopping between fcc and hcp adsorption sites at high temperatures to quantum tunneling at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results using hese give evidence for low adsorbate - substrate friction and repulsive inter - adsorbate interactions , and our experimental tunneling rates for h are much higher than those seen previously for other surfaces such as ni(111 )  @xcite , cu(111 )  @xcite and cu(001 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling from excited vibrational states was found to play a key role for h diffusion on ni(111 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for h on ru(0001 ) , however , the low temperature rate in [ fig : rate ] is effectively non - activated ( the data is fitted by an activation energy of ( -2@xmath162 )  mev  @xcite and so tunneling from the excited states ( the lowest of which has been determined from hreels to be 84  mev  @xcite ) does not contribute significantly at low temperatures . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the fcc - hcp energy barrier is 150  mev for ru(0001 ) but closer to 200  mev for ni(111 )  @xcite , which would lead to faster tunneling for the case of h on ru(0001 ) in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> recent stm results for h diffusing on cu(111 ) at 5  k  @xcite ( comprising streaks on stm images ) were interpreted to give an h jump rate of 30  hz . however , in addition to the possible presence of tip induced effects , the imaging rate was only 5.5 lines  s@xmath1 and so would be insensitive to diffusion as fast as reported here . </S>",
    "<S> ab initio pimd rates show reasonable agreement with the temperature dependence of the experimental results at high temperatures while the tunneling rates at low temperatures are significantly underestimated , similar to previous studies on other surfaces employing empirical potentials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is highly interesting and by performing instanton calculations on a modified potential energy surface we showed that small changes in activation energy and energy difference between fcc and hcp adsorption sites may play a role . </S>",
    "<S> however , other features of this system may also be important in driving the faster experimental than theoretical rates which highlights the need for future experiments and theoretical calculations of h diffusion on other well - defined metal surfaces . </S>"
