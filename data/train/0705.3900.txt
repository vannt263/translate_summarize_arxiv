    "remarkable examples include the large transport anisotropy observed at low - temperature in quantum hall samples after the onset of electronic nematic phases @xcite , the colossal magneto - resistance in manganites @xcite , the appearance of striped phases in systems with competing interactions @xcite as well as of pseudogap phases in high @xmath0 superconductors @xcite . in all the above mentioned examples the relevant optimal inhomogeneities",

    "to get control on the onset of complexity of a condensed matter system is desirable not only for understanding new emergent functionalities useful for the engineering of new materials and devices but also for discovering levels of theoretical description enabling to well separate the properties of global phases from the ones arising from phase competition ; global average behaviors are , in fact , not helpful for this task @xcite .",
    "quantum devices provide a controllable setting ( one can fabricate them ! ) to investigate the effects induced by inhomogeneities on the emergence of complex behaviors .    quantum devices with built - in inhomogeneities",
    "may be realized with today s available technologies using either superconducting josephson junction networks ( jjn ) @xcite or ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . due to their versatility and to the great reliability of the fabrication technologies developed for their construction , jjns and ultracold atoms in optical lattices",
    "are by now the prototype of complex physical systems exhibiting a variety of interesting physical behaviors , adjustable by acting only on very few external parameters and , as we shall point out , also by the pertinent engineering of the network s shape ; in addition , they provide controllable settings to investigate the properties of granular superconductors or high @xmath0 superconductors @xcite paving a very promising avenue in the engineering of quantum states of potential interest for processing quantum information @xcite .",
    "a josephson junction may be realized using two superconducting grains separated by an insulating layer ; by an appropriate engineering of the insulating support , one can fabricate an inhomogeneous network of josephson junctions with a given shape .",
    "inhomogeneous jjns @xcite have been studied for a long time with the aim of establishing the effect of space connectivity on superconductivity @xcite .",
    "recently , the appealing perspective to realize devices for the manipulation of quantum information stimulated the analysis of inhomogeneous planar jjns with non conventional connectivity @xcite , engineered to sustain a topologically ordered ground state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , transport measurements on superconducting wire networks evidenced - even in pure systems with non - dispersive eigenstates - interesting anomalies of the network critical current induced by the interplay between the network s geometry and topology with externally applied magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical analysis of rhombi chains has evidenced the exciting possibility of being able to detect @xmath1 superconductivity through measurements of the supercurrent in presence of a pertinent external magnetic field @xcite . here",

    "a one - dimensional optical lattice is realized using two counter - propagating laser beams arranged to create a periodic potential where bosons may tunnel between wells with a rate adjustable by tuning the laser s power controlling the height of the inter - well barrier . in this realization",
    "a lattice site is a minimum of the periodic potential while the links between neighbor vertices are provided by the barrier between wells . by suitably arranging more",
    "laser beams one is able to engineer the shape of the optical networks @xcite allowing , in principle , for an experimental testing of the proprieties of inhomogeneous lattices such as the ones analyzed in @xcite . to fabricate bosonic josephson junctions ( bjj ) and networks ( bjjn )",
    "one should require also that all the atoms in a given well are described by the same macroscopic wave function : a bjj is obtained , then , by loading - at a temperature below the bose - einstein condensation critical temperature - a condensate in each well of a double well potential @xcite while the barrier separating the two condensates acts as a josephson link @xcite . with a multi - well optical potential ,",
    "provided that the heights of the barriers are much higher than the condensate s chemical potential , one fabricates a bjjn ( i.e. , a lattice of weakly coupled condensates ) . in the following we shall evidence how bosons hopping on comb - shaped optical lattices undergo a spatial bose - einstein condensation on the comb s backbone ; this happens even if the bosons are free and the network s euclidean dimension is @xmath2 .",
    "the emergence of complex behaviors in the superconducting and bosonic arrays analyzed in this paper is determined solely by the pertinent engineering of the network s connectivity , since it is due only to the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix ( i.e. , of the matrix defined as @xmath3 if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are vertices connected by a link , and @xmath6 otherwise @xcite ) , which fully characterizes the network s geometry and topology . in some very specific instances @xcite",

    "to better clarify our arguments , we find instructive to compare our results with those obtainable if the same devices were defined on a chain , since the latter is , after all , the simplest graph of euclidean dimension @xmath2 .",
    "in section 2 we determine the equations governing the properties of inhomogeneous superconducting and bosonic networks .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a comb - shaped network and to a comparison of its spectrum with the one pertinent to a linear chain : there we see that , while the adjacency matrices of both graphs admit a continuum set of delocalized states starting at the same eigenvalue , the adjacency matrix of a comb supports an hidden spectrum . in section 4",
    "we evidence how the states belonging to the hidden spectrum are responsible for the enhancement of the zero - voltage josephson critical currents in superconducting jjns as well as for the emergence of the spatial bec in bosonic networks on domains pertinently selected by the network s topology .",
    "section 5 is devoted to our conclusions and final remarks while the appendices report on some pertinent but rather lengthy computational details .",
    "in this section we shall summarize the many - body description of superconducting and bosonic networks .",
    "our purpose here is mainly to clarify the assumptions underlying the equations used in section 4 to characterize the complex behaviors emerging from a pertinent choice of the connectivity in jjns and bosonic networks .",
    "our approach uses the self- consistent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xcite since they provide an unified framework to account for the description of fermionic and bosonic systems enabling to appreciate in a rather simple context the differences ( and similarities ) between these systems .",
    "we shall describe first the microscopic theory of inhomogeneous superconducting networks realized by putting on each site of a graph a superconducting grain . on each island",

    "we , then , analyze ultracold atoms ( spinless , for simplicity ) in deep optical lattices and derive the set of equations describing both the excitations and the condensate s dynamics ; in dealing with atomic systems one should only account for repulsive interactions between bosons as it is well known that attractive interactions lead to instabilities even in presence of confining traps @xcite .",
