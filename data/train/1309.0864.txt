    "in the last years there has been a renewed interest in the analysis of interacting field theories in de sitter spacetimes .",
    "on the one hand , there is observational evidence that supports the existence of periods of exponential or quasi - exponential expansion of the universe , both during the inflationary era before the radiation dominated period in the early universe , and in the present accelerated expansion .",
    "quantum fields may play a relevant role during both periods . on the other hand , the high degree of symmetry of de sitter spacetime ,",
    "make it a very interesting arena to analyze conceptual problems of semiclassical and quantum gravity .",
    "there are several unsettled questions regarding interacting quantum fields in de sitter spacetime .",
    "in particular , perturbative calculations show the existence of secular growth and/or infrared ( ir ) divergences @xcite .",
    "the appearance of terms that secularly grow with time , which can lead to a breakdown of perturbation theory at late times , might be due to a deficiency of the perturbative approach .",
    "therefore , it is clear that in order to make reliable predictions , such infrared effects would have to be understood , and for this the use of nonperturbative techniques seems to be unavoidable .",
    "there are several works in the literature attempting to understand the physical effects of the secular growth @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been much progress in the context of single - field inflationary models where there are only adiabatic perturbations , and the variable @xmath1 that describes the curvature perturbations remains constant on super - horizon scales @xcite .",
    "working directly with the evolution operator for @xmath1 , it has been shown @xcite that despite the existence of individual contributions to @xmath1 correlation functions that secularly grow with time , when all of them are added up cancellations occur so that the final result does not exhibit a secular growth .",
    "for this , the use of symmetries and nonperturbative techniques have shown to be crucial and the computations to be very subtle , even for the case in which only scalar perturbations are considered . a complete explicit calculation that addresses",
    "the renormalization procedure is extremely complex , and still lacking .",
    "an alternative two - step procedure to perturbatively compute loop corrections to @xmath1 correlation functions has been also applied ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the first step consists in calculating correlation functions of the inflaton fluctuations , and the second in obtaining the ones of @xmath1 by performing a gauge transformation @xcite . in this case , even though the correlation functions of the inflaton fluctuations can show secular growth , the use of nonperturbative schemes is avoided by performing the gauge transformation soon after the field modes exited the horizon ( which would be well before the secular growing effect becomes relevant ) .",
    "nevertheless , to our knowledge , when loop corrections are included there is still no formal general proof of the equivalence between the two procedures .",
    "the effect of secular growth is less clear for massless interacting test fields in de sitter space ( which in the context of inflationary models could be interpreted as an approximation to entropy modes ) .",
    "this kind of fields have been considered by several authors in different frameworks ; for instance , in the stochastic approach @xcite , in the context of euclidean de sitter space @xcite , using dynamical renormalization group resummations @xcite , or other nonperturbative approximation schemes @xcite . in particular , it has been pointed out that in the presence of interactions a scalar field dynamically acquires a mass @xcite , which screens perturbative ir divergences . the dynamical generated mass has been obtained in the different approaches and , although the numerical value does not coincide for some of the approximations , they agree on that it is non - analytic in the coupling constant . also , it has been argued that for scalar fields presenting a symmetry breaking tree - level potential , the presence of large infrared effects could give rise to a symmetry restoration @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the conditions under which the symmetry is restored and the order of the phase transition are still unclear @xcite .",
    "we will come back to these points later .",
    "nonperturbative quantum field theory is a difficult topic even in flat spacetime .",
    "the most widely used approximations involve the selective summation of feynman diagrams of infinite perturbative order , like the hartree approximation , or expansions in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of quantum fields ( or the number of colors in qcd ) .",
    "nonperturbative calculations can be addressed using the effective action for composite operators introduced a long time ago by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite , also called in the literature two - particle irreducible effective action ( 2pi ea ) .",
    "indeed , this is a general and systematically improvable approach for resumming classes of feynman diagrams . in its lowest approximation level",
    ", it corresponds to the so called hartree ( or gaussian ) approximation .",
    "the gaussian approximation can also be introduced without referring to the 2pi ea , by means of a variational principle .",
    "it has been the subject of many works after the papers by stevenson @xcite , in which the author showed that it is possible to choose carefully the bare constants of the @xmath0 theory allowing for the emergence of a nontrivial quantum theory in the limit of infinite cutoff ( it was shown afterwards that a different choice of the parameters that involve a wave function renormalization is also possible , resulting in a completely different quantum theory @xcite ) .",
    "both possibilities have their corresponding counterparts in curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the quantum theories so derived have different drawbacks , which originate from the fact that in the perturbative regime ( where the renormalized coupling constants are very small ) those theories do not approach the ones defined by the usual perturbation theory in terms of feynman diagrams , which are based on a loop - by - loop renormalization procedure .",
    "moreover , for finite values of the cutoff the theory is unstable , since the bare coupling constant is negative and goes to zero as the cutoff tends to infinite @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is no clear way to systematically improve the approximation based on such variational principle .",
    "the use of the 2pi ea solves some of these drawbacks by changing the renormalization procedure .",
    "indeed , in this formalism , there are multiple definitions of a given @xmath4-point function , which are equivalent in the exact theory but not necessarily if some approximation is considered .",
    "when the theory is truncated , it is mandatory to impose some consistency relations between the different counterterms , and this is possible only if one allows for more bare constants than usual , which are to be fixed in terms of the usual number of renormalized parameters ( the ones that are in principle measurable ) .",
    "in other words , for a given renormalized parameter one includes different counterterms .",
    "there has been much progress in understanding the renormalization properties of general truncation of the 2pi effective action , and a systematic method for a consistent renormalization has been developed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze interacting quantum fields in general spacetimes using the 2pi ea with the consistent renormalization procedure of ref .",
    "we will show that the renormalization procedure can be generalized to curved spacetimes , and we will find the explicit renormalized form for the mean value equation and for the propagator of the fluctuations .",
    "we will then analyze the particular case of de sitter spacetime .",
    "the study of the mean value equation along with the corresponding effective potential will allow us to show that , under this nonperturbative approximation and renormalization , depending on the values of the parameters , spontaneous symmetry breaking may take place in de sitter spacetime .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the results based on the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which one can prove that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not compatible with de sitter symmetries @xcite ( a similar incompatibility holds to leading order in the @xmath2 approximation to @xmath5 models , as mentioned in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "our results show discrepancies with those of ref.@xcite , where the effective potential in de sitter spacetime has been also recently considered using the consistent renormalization procedure .",
    "as we will see , the discrepancies come from the milder version of the consistency conditions used in that work .    before describing the details of the calculations ,",
    "it is worth to stress here that the aim of this paper is not to arrive at a conclusive answer to these points . indeed , previous works based in the hartree approximation in flat spacetime suggest that this is not possible .",
    "for example , it is well known that the hartree approximation predicts a first order phase transition when applied to @xmath5 models , while other nonperturbative methods give a second - order phase transition @xcite , in agreement with expectations based on general arguments @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks of the hartree approximation can be cured by including two loops corrections to the 2pi ea @xcite .",
    "a similar situation could arise in curved spacetimes , in particular when discussing symmetry breaking in de sitter spacetime .",
    "therefore , one of our purposes here is to push forward a rigorous and critical analysis of the situation , by starting with an understanding of the simplest nonperturbative approximation , along with its limitations , but having in mind the necessity of an improvement .",
    "this subject is clearly worth studying in detail , to the end of analyzing its eventual relevance not only for correlation functions , but also for the evolution of the universe itself through its contribution to the energy momentum tensor in the semiclassical einstein equations ( see ) , which is the subject of a forthcoming paper ii @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this fact is well known in flat spacetime , and the consistency conditions can be forced by allowing for more than one counterterm for each mass or coupling constant of the theory @xcite . our first goal in this paper has been to show that this  consistent renormalization procedure \" can be applied to the mean field and gap equations in general curved spacetimes .",
    "several explicit calculations previously performed in flat spacetime used as regulator a momentum cutoff ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this is problematic in curved backgrounds , and in order to maintain the covariance of the regularized theory we used dimensional regularization .",
    "the consistent renormalization procedure has been partially extended to curved spacetimes in some recent works @xcite , where the renormalization of the mean field and gap equations has been analyzed .",
    "our results in sec .",
    "iii are more complete than those in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have included the full adiabatic expansion of the propagator , we have written the renormalized equations in terms of the physical parameters defined from the effective potential , and we have shown explicitly that , when expressed in terms of these physical parameters , the equations are independent of the regularization scale @xmath6 introduced by dimensional regularization .    in the last part of the paper ( secs .",
    "iv and v ) , we have focused on de sitter spacetime .",
    "we have written the explicit form of the mean field and gap equations for this particular metric , and we have computed the effective potential . for this , we have considered the renormalized parameters at @xmath30 as defined from the effective potential corresponding , in turn , to minkowski spacetime and de sitter spacetime with a given curvature @xmath194 . then , we performed an analysis of the effective potential for different values of the curvature of the original de sitter spacetime @xmath140 .",
    "this analysis is somehow analogous to the one done in @xcite for a self - interacting scalar field at finite temperature , where the renormalization point is chosen for a fixed finite value of the temperature .",
    "a relevant conclusion of our work is that the hartree approximation and the application of the consistency conditions impose restrictions on the ms- parameters of the theory , as discussed in secs iv and v. on the one hand , the renormalized mass @xmath112 must be positive . on the other hand , the definition of the renormalized @xmath65 in terms of the fourth derivative of the effective potential and the consistency condition for the 4-point function imply @xmath6-independent relations between ms and renormalized parameters . from them , it is clear that some choices of the ms - parameters may not be compatible with the consistency conditions . in particular",

    "it is plausible that the inclusion of the setting sun diagram in the computation of the 2pi ea restores the @xmath29 symmetry .",
    "we hope to address this interesting issue in a forthcoming work . however , there are several technical complications to be sorted . on the one hand , the use of the ctp formalism will be unavoidable when considering nonlocal terms in the 2pi ea .",
    "on the other hand , the inclusion of higher loops in the 2pi ea induces some subtle points in the renormalization even in flat spacetime @xcite , that will have their counterpart in curved spaces .",

    "<S> we consider a quantum scalar field with @xmath0 interaction in curved spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum effects are taken into account nonperturbatively using the hartree approximation to the 2pi effective action . </S>",
    "<S> although this approximation has been considered in many previous works , we reconsider it using a consistent nonperturbative renormalization procedure , which we extend to general curved spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the renormalized equations for the mean field and for the propagator of the fluctuations , showing explicitly their independence on the arbitrary scale introduced by the regularization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our results to the particular case of de sitter spacetime and discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the results depend strongly on the renormalization procedure . </S>"
