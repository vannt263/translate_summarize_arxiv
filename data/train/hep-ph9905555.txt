    "new data on the photoproduction and electroproduction of charm in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) recently obtained by collaborations of zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite at the hera accelerator , stimulate the discussion on the following problem : what is an interpretation of these data in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) ? at present the data show the experimental confirmation of qualitative predictions of pqcd . however , essential quantitative deviations of measured cross sections from the theoretical expectations were observed in some kinematical regions , i.e. the discrepancies in the form of @xmath0-meson spectra were found .",
    "exploring the perturbative theory in the processes under consideration is strictly justified due to quite large transverse momenta of @xmath0-mesons , @xmath5 . to the same moment",
    ", we can not completely avoid nonperturbative terms in the calculations , and the hadronization process of @xmath2-quarks produced in hard collisions of initial partons is usually described by means of a fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath6 , where the parameter @xmath7 determines the scale of factorization for the probabilities of perturbative subprocess and binding the quarks into the hadron .",
    "the hadronization of quarks is determined by the dynamics of confinement .",
    "the information on the nonperturbative ff is taken from the data on the production of charmed particles in @xmath8-annihilation @xcite .",
    "the dependence of ff on @xmath7 is determined by the leading logarithmic approximation of qcd ( lo ) and corrections to it ( nlo ) . calculating the cross sections for the photoproduction of heavy quarks in the @xmath9-order",
    ", some authors neglect the @xmath6 changes versus @xmath10 in the hadronization @xcite .",
    "this dependence of ff was taken into account in other papers @xcite . in this way",
    ", the authors used the initial ff at @xmath11 1 gev in the forms of both the ans \" atze based on the reciprocity relation @xcite and ff by peterson et al .",
    "@xcite .    in pqcd",
    "two approaches are used for the calculation of @xmath12-pair production up to the @xmath9-terms . in the first ,",
    "authors assume that the light quarks and gluons are the only partons present in the photon and proton , when the @xmath2-quarks are produced in the interactions of those partons . in this way the nonzero mass of @xmath2-quark is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the second approach suggests that the @xmath2-quark is the additional `` active '' flavor supposed as massless , and the @xmath2-quark distributions in the initial particles are introduced in the form of corresponding structure functions @xcite .",
    "note , that in the both ways the hadronization of @xmath2-quarks is described in the framework of fragmentation model , which results in the convolution of perturbative distribution of charmed quarks with the fragmentation function : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ff normalized by the probability of @xmath2-quark transition into the @xmath0-meson @xmath15 , which is measured in the @xmath8-annihilation @xcite ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath7 is the factorization scale for the perturbative partonic cross section @xmath17 .    according to the model of heavy quark fragmentation ,",
    "the basic condition of its applicability is @xmath18 or @xmath19 providing a jet - like shape of measured events .",
    "however , the dominant term of statistics is integrated in the region of @xmath20 , where the model of ( [ fact ] ) may not be explored .    in the model offered below ,",
    "we describe the production of @xmath21 quark state in pqcd and use the semilocal duality @xcite assuming that this quark state repeats the distributions of hadron with the accuracy up to the factor depending on the quantum numbers of @xmath21 and the hadron . in this way we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams corresponding to the production of @xmath21-system in the fixed order over @xmath22 and @xmath23 (",
    "so the leading order is the fourth one ) .",
    "then we quite successfully describe the production of @xmath0-mesons at @xmath20 as well as reliably and correctly approach the results of fragmentation model at @xmath18 . such the agreement of model estimates with the experimental data",
    "can be reached , if we add the term of octet - color state for the production of @xmath21 pair along with the contribution of the singlet - color state .    in the framework of pqcd taking into account the full @xmath24-dependence of the matrix element ,",
    "exact calculations give a good description of data on the dis production of charm .",
    "this estimate is carried out up to nlo in refs .",
    "@xcite . despite of the qualitative success in such the approach , quantitative deviations between the predictions and measured differential cross sections take place as in the photoproduction of charm . in present paper",
    "we calculate the differential cross sections for the @xmath0 production in dis in the framework of model taking into account the mentioned contribution of octet operator into the production of charmed quark - light quark pair .",
    "among the well - known parameterizations of ff , the model by peterson et al .",
    "@xcite argues the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the normalization factor , and @xmath27 is the free phenomenological parameter dependent of @xmath7 .",
    "this ff quite accurately describes the data on the production of @xmath28- and @xmath29-mesons in @xmath8-annihilation at high energies , where the fragmentation mechanism dominates @xcite .    according to motivations by the authors of parameterization ( [ peter ] ) , the behaviour versus @xmath30 in eq.([peter ] )",
    "is determined by the virtuality in the propagator of heavy @xmath2-quark .",
    "indeed , let @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the momenta of @xmath0-meson and an associated jet , respectively .",
    "then the denominator of perturbative propagator has the form @xmath33 expanding this expression in small parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 and defining @xmath36 , we get @xmath37 in the parameterization of ( [ peter ] ) the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 are treated as phenomenological and nonperturbative parameters , though we can clear see that @xmath27 corresponds to the mass ratio squared for the jet mass over the quark mass , whereas the jet mass logarithmically grows with the increase of total energy in the @xmath8-annihilation .",
    "the consistent consideration of heavy quark fragmentation @xcite with account for both the quantum numbers of meson in the final state and the qcd - structure of vertex on fig .  1 , leads to the following analytical expression the restricted number of diagrams contributes .",
    "it is well known that the only hard diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) contributes to the fragmentation in the special axial gauge ( see ref.@xcite ) . in the covariant gauge",
    "two hard diagrams do .",
    "the calculations of fragmentation functions were done in both gauges , and the ff does not depend on the gauge . ] : @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 which corresponds to the square of wave function at the origin for two quarks in the framework of nonrelativistic potential model : @xmath41 .",
    "the effective mass of light quark @xmath42 determines the form as well as the normalization of ff : @xmath43 where @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the model under consideration we put the probability of fragmentation @xmath45 independent of the scale @xmath46 , so that @xmath47 remaines the constant value extracted from the experimental data mentioned .",
    "we argue the following motivation : the distributions of partons inside the heavy - light meson have distinct terms corresponding to the valence quarks .",
    "so , for the neutral charmed meson @xmath48 , say , in the infinite momentum frame these contributions are given by the functions depending on the fractions of longitudinal momentum and the transverse momenta of partons .",
    "the valence terms are determined by @xmath49 so that the functions yield the average fractions @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 denotes the binding energy of heavy quark inside the meson .",
    "then , in the model we neglect the dispersions of quark fractions and put the valence quark velocities equal to each other : @xmath53 . generally , we can write down the following representation for the fock state of charmed meson : @xmath54 where the quark pairs @xmath55 carry the mentioned fractions of meson momentum , and they belong to two possible color states : the singlet or octet , and the operators @xmath56 generate the quark - gluon sea inside the meson at the characteristic scale of bound state @xmath46",
    ". there are several qualitative features of this representation .",
    "first , the operators @xmath57 are nonperturbative .",
    "therefore the scale of interactions in @xmath57 is about the scale of confinement @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the heavy - light meson , for the heavy quarkonium there are the counting rules due to the small relative velocity of heavy quarks , i.e. due to the smallness of typical inverse size of bound state with respect to the quark mass . in the heavy quarkonium the @xmath59 contribution is suppressed by a power of relative velocity @xcite . in the heavy meson under consideration , the octet contribution is not suppressed , and it is of the same order as the singlet one .",
    "second feature concerns for the excitations in the system of valence quarks . for the heavy quarkonium",
    "the colored @xmath60-wave states contribute , since their sizes are still small enough to propagate with no decay into the pairs of heavy mesons . in the heavy - light system",
    "the @xmath60-wave states are suppressed because they are heavy and have large sizes leading to an instability .",
    "then , for the production of charmed mesons the contribution of singlet and octet @xmath61-wave state is essential only .",
    "the operators @xmath56 are infrared and can not be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "however , they do not influence onto the distributions of meson at the transverse momenta higher that the charmed quark mass , @xmath20 .",
    "to get rid of the nonperturbative quark - gluon sea from the calculations , we have to restrict the gluon virtualities @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 .",
    "we suppose @xmath64 , and consider the massive light quarks with @xmath65 .",
    "further , along with the production of color - singlet state of @xmath66-system we have to take into account the production of color - octet state with the corresponding transition into the hadron ( @xmath0-meson ) .",
    "as we know from the experience on the consideration of production for the mesons containing two heavy quarks , the octet term is suppressed by the fourth power of relative velocity @xmath67 for the quarks inside the meson @xcite . in the problem studied the velocity is not small and the contribution by the octet can be comparable with the singlet term . due to the specifics of color amplitude for the @xmath8-annihilation the ratio between the production of color - singlet and color - octet @xmath66-states",
    "is fixed , so that introducing the octet term for the fragmentation we have to substitute for @xmath68 in eqs.(3 ) and ( [ prob ] ) by @xmath69 as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71    as we have already mentioned , for the mesons containing the light relativistic quark we expect @xmath72 , since @xmath73 . then from eq.([ratio ] ) we see that at such the ratio of operators the singlet production dominates in @xmath8-annihilation .",
    "the form of differential cross sections is one and the same for the singlet and octet mechanisms in the fragmentation model .",
    "therefore , we can not distinguish the singlet and octet terms in the production of @xmath0-mesons in the @xmath8-annihilation .",
    "however , in deep inelastic scattering the situation is essentially changed in the region of @xmath20 , where the fragmentation is not the only mechanism , determining the production of heavy meson .",
    "thus , we have quite a definite picture for the description of charmed meson production in perturbative qcd with the factorization of terms responsible for the contributions by the singlet and octet operators .",
    "concerning the form of ff in this approach of factorization for the hard perturbative amplitude and nonperturbative binding operators , we note that the virtuality of heavy quark is equal to @xmath74 so that @xmath75 . at an appropriate choice of @xmath42 and @xmath76",
    "we can reach the ff behaviour similar with that of ff by peterson et al . in ( [ peter ] ) .",
    "the logarithmic dependence of @xmath27 mentioned above can be reasonably neglected in the region , where @xmath77 , i.e. it is not large .",
    "as we have shown above , in the @xmath8-annihilation we obtain the reliable description of cross sections for the production of charmed particles , if we use the perturbative calculations with a nonzero mass of light quark . in this way the calculations",
    "are reduced to the evaluation of single diagram in a special axial gauge ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite . in other processes the number of diagrams is essentially greater than the mentioned one .",
    "the complete set of such diagrams in the @xmath78-order is shown in fig .  2 for the subprocess of @xmath79 .",
    "among this set , wherein the initial photon is on mass - shell for the photoproduction and virtual for the deep inelastic scattering , we can identify the diagrams corresponding to the hard production of @xmath2-quarks up to @xmath80 with the consequent fragmentation of heavy quark in the @xmath81-order ( for example , graphs 16 and 19 ) .",
    "these terms dominate at @xmath18 , which reproduces the predictions of fragmentation model by eq.([fact ] ) in the kinematical region specified .",
    "let us study the process @xmath82 at a rather high energy @xmath83 to prove the validity of our statement on the factorization .",
    "the large subprocess energy is required to reach the limit of @xmath84 , where the predictions of the model can be compared with the fragmentation regime in the form of ( [ fact ] ) .",
    "the calculation results for the @xmath85-distribution of the @xmath0-meson production cross section in the framework of our model in comparison with the fragmentation prediction ( [ fact ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "3 . in eq .",
    "( [ fact ] ) the born approximation for the @xmath12-pair production and the fragmentation function in the form of ( 3 ) have been used .",
    "we can see that the factorization for the hard @xmath12-pair production and the probability of @xmath2-quark fragmentation into @xmath0 for the photoproduction cross section takes place at @xmath86  gev for the singlet state and at @xmath87  gev for the octet term at the photon - gluon energy equal to 200 gev .",
    "we find that at the lower energy of photon - gluon interaction , say , at @xmath88 gev , the fragmentation regime works at @xmath89 gev for the singlet state production , but the differential cross section for the production of octet state can not be described by the factorized form of fragmentation since at such the energy the higher twists over @xmath85 dominate completely in the whole kinematical region .",
    "thus , the model approaches the fragmentation regime at rather large transverse momenta . at @xmath20",
    "the dominant contribution comes due to the diagrams of nonfragmentational kind . in these diagrams",
    "the independently produced @xmath12 and @xmath90 pairs after rescattering are transformed into hadrons .",
    "we call them as the recombination diagrams ( see , for example , graphs 5 , 6 , 7 in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the fragmentation and recombination diagrams have different forms of asymptotic behavior at large @xmath85 .",
    "so , the recombination contribution at @xmath18 drops like @xmath91 in contrast to the fragmentation term decreasing as @xmath92 .",
    "the fragmentation approach is valid at @xmath93 and can not be applied at @xmath94 ( see fig .  3 ) . to describe the region of @xmath94 we have to take into account subleading terms over @xmath95 , i.e. the higher twists .",
    "the offered model allows us to get correct factorization at high @xmath85 and to account for the subleading terms on the basis of gauge invariance dictating the consideration of complete set of diagrams to the given , fixed , order in @xmath23 .    in the framework of fragmentation approach",
    ", the lo calculations must take into account the resolved photon contribution . in the model under consideration , which involves the higher orders , this contribution is also included by means of diagrams , where the splitting of photon into the pairs of light quarks is taken into account perturbatively at rather high @xmath85 , and , hence , at large virtualities .",
    "an analysis of @xcite shown that the logarithmic corrections to the @xmath2-quark production become essential at @xmath96  gev .",
    "thus , we can believe that at moderate @xmath85 : @xmath97 , the fixed order calculations ( lo , nlo ) are valid .",
    "remember , eq.([fact ] ) can not be applied at @xmath20 because of two following reasons :    \\1 ) the limit of @xmath18 is not justified at @xmath20 ,    \\2 ) the higher twists over @xmath85 must be taken into account beyond the fragmentation regime leading to eq.([fact ] ) .    in contrast , the offered model under consideration can be used in the kinematic region @xmath20 too , where eq.([fact ] ) does not work , and it reproduces ( [ fact ] ) at @xmath18 .",
    "thus , exploring the gauge invariance to the fixed order , we extend the fragmentation term up to the complete set of diagrams to cover the higher twists over @xmath20 .",
    "we would like to stress that the perturbative calculations for the production of @xmath21-system can reasonably describe the region of @xmath20 , if we suppose the appropriate effective mass of light quark @xmath42 . in the calculations we chose the value @xmath98 .",
    "then the gluon virtualities are greater than @xmath99 , which allows us to use pqcd and to stay beyond the region of infrared divergency",
    ".    remember that at @xmath100  gev we normalize the absolute value of cross section due to relation ( [ prob ] ) , assuming that the probability of fragmentation does not depend on the scale .",
    "in contrast to @xmath8-annihilation , in both the photoproduction and the electroproduction we find another ratio of fragmentational and recombinational contributions of octet state in comparison with the ratio for the singlet .",
    "so , if @xmath101 , then the recombination contributes to the production of octet with the same order of magnitude as for the singlet production .",
    "therefore , at the transverse momenta @xmath20 , where the recombination dominates , the values of cross sections for the singlet and octet are close to each other , when at @xmath18 , where the basic role is played by the fragmentation , the octet state term is suppressed as @xmath102 , according to eq.([ratio ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the introduction of octet term does not practically change the cross section for the production of @xmath0-mesons at @xmath103 , however , it essentially contributes in the region of @xmath104 .",
    "we fix the value of fragmentation probability @xmath45 taken from the data on the @xmath0-meson production in @xmath8-annihilation at lep , and we put the choice of @xmath46 , @xmath42 , @xmath76 , so that eq.([prob ] ) definitely determines the value of @xmath105 operator matrix element .",
    "so , if @xmath106 then @xmath107    such the choice has allowed us to describe the data on the photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons .",
    "the results of calculations are shown in fig .  4 in comparison with the zeus data @xcite measured in the following kinematical region : @xmath108 gev , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , where @xmath57 is the total energy of @xmath112-interactions , @xmath24 is the photon virtuality , and @xmath113 is the pseudorapidity of @xmath0-meson .",
    "we see in fig .  4 that the value of production cross section for the @xmath0-mesons can not be explained by the singlet term only .",
    "the relative value of the octet contribution @xmath114 allows us to reach the good agreement with the experimental spectra of @xmath0-mesons .",
    "we put the attention to the mentioned distinct difference in the behaviour of distributions over the transverse momentum for the singlet and octet terms .",
    "the contribution of octet state is enforced in the forward direction ( @xmath115 ) . at the chosen values of operator matrix elements",
    "the contributions of singlet and octet are close to each other at @xmath20 , while at @xmath18 the octet term becomes less essential than the singlet one .",
    "we can see that the accounting of the octet contribution essentially improves the form of predicted cross section distribution over the pseudorapidity in the forward direction .",
    "such the improvement is due to the fact that the recombination diagrams dominant at @xmath20 are enforced in the octet part of the cross section by the color factor .",
    "the interaction of virtual @xmath2-quark with the light valence quark in the initial hadron can be taken into account easily , as we will show below , but this process becomes essential only at low energies of charm production near the threshold .",
    "the scale of factorization for the gluon structure function in the proton has been fixed @xmath116 .",
    "calculating the differential cross sections we suppose two values for the scale of factorizing the matrix elements for the quark operators @xmath117 : @xmath118 ( the upper line ) and @xmath119 ( the down curve ) .",
    "we see that the experimental data on the photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons at hera can be described in the model in the better way if we put @xmath120 and @xmath118 .    the predictions for the photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons in the low energy region studied by zeus @xcite : @xmath108 gev , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , are shown in fig .  5 .",
    "in the calculations we use the same values of @xmath68 and @xmath124 as they stand above .    unfortunately , the present experimental data do not yet allow us to extract the value of @xmath124 with a low uncertainty , and with the mentioned variety in the factorization scales we can write down @xcite @xmath125 it is quite clear that changing the parameter @xmath126 we can enhance or decrease the contribution of higher twists in the region of @xmath20 . in the calculations we neglect the difference between the spectra of vector and pseudoscalar octet states ,",
    "whose contributions are effectively summed up in the corresponding operator .",
    "furthermore , we do not consider a possible influence of @xmath60-wave color - octet states , since their contribution is suppressed in comparison with the @xmath61-wave contributions , as we saw in similar studies @xcite .      in the model under consideration",
    "we predict the cross section for the photoproduction of @xmath127- and @xmath128-meson .",
    "the general features of these processes were discussed in our work @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis is given below .",
    "the probability of @xmath2-quark fragmentation into @xmath127 or @xmath128 , @xmath129 , was fixed from the data on the @xmath127-meson production in the @xmath8-annihilation at lep @xcite .    using this value of @xmath130 and replacing the effective valence quark mass @xmath131  gev by @xmath132  gev in the amplitude of @xmath0-production",
    ", we calculate the expectation of differential cross section for @xmath128 .",
    "the analogous technique was used for the calculation of @xmath127 production cross section . in the both cases",
    "the value 1.3 was chosen for the relative octet contribution such as in the @xmath0-meson production .",
    "it is worth to mention that the flavor @xmath133-symmetry for the @xmath134 quarks is broken .",
    "so , to obtain the experimentally measured fraction of charmed - stranged events in the charm production , @xmath130 , we put the effective operator @xmath135 for the @xmath2-quark fragmentation into @xmath127 to be approximately twice greater than @xmath136 .    in this work we present the differential cross section for the sum of @xmath127- and @xmath128-mesons because the experimental discrimination between the events with @xmath127 and @xmath128 is problematic .",
    "the reason is the necessary registration of a soft photon coming from the dominant mode of @xmath137 decay , which is quite difficult task .",
    "the results of our calculations in comparison with the zeus experimental data @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "6 for the following kinematical region : @xmath138  gev , @xmath139 , @xmath140  gev and @xmath109 .",
    "we see that the predictions for the @xmath127 and @xmath141 photoproduction cross section are in a good agreement with the experiment .",
    "in contrast to the photoproduction , we have to take into account the exact @xmath24 dependence in dis for the calculation of @xmath0 production . in this respect",
    "we evaluate the tensor of leptonic currents squared and averaged over the polarizations to contract it with the photon - gluon vertices in the charm production calculated numerically at arbitrary @xmath24 of photon .",
    "again we consider the production of @xmath21-pair in the @xmath142-order .",
    "the used technique of calculations allows us to evaluate the cross sections for the production of @xmath0-mesons in the case when the initial photon is essentially virtual , i.e. off mass shell . for this purpose the matrix element used in the photoproduction @xmath143 taken at the photon virtuality @xmath24 not equal to zero , where @xmath144 is the index corresponding to the photon polarization , is squared and convoluted with the spin averaged electron current squared in the following way : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the square of amplitude for the electroproduction of @xmath0-mesons , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the initial and final momenta of positron , and @xmath149 .",
    "the results of calculations are presented in fig .  7 for the production of @xmath0-mesons in deep inelastic scattering of @xmath150 in comparison with the experimental data of zeus collaboration @xcite in the following kinematical region : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 .    calculating the matrix element we use the running coupling constant of qcd at the scales @xmath156 ( the upper curve ) and @xmath157 ( the lower curve ) , and the structure function of gluon inside the proton",
    "is evaluated at the scale @xmath158 in the cteq4 parameterization @xcite .",
    "such the choice allows us , first , to get a good description of electroproduction and , second , to reach the scales used in the photoproduction at @xmath159 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath160 has been supposed the same as in the photoproduction in the good agreement with the data .",
    "since we see quite a good description of current data on the photoproduction of charm at @xmath20 in the model , it would be of interest to test its predictions for the total cross sections of charm photoproduction in a broad region of interaction energy @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the total cross sections of charmed particles at the @xmath112-energies in the interval from 20 to 300 gev ( see fig .",
    "8) .    to estimate the total charm yield we multiply the @xmath161 and @xmath162 cross section by the factor of @xmath163 being the inverse fraction of these particles in the charm events as was measured in the @xmath8annihilation .",
    "furthermore , to compare with the data at low energies we have to take into account the additional contribution of diagrams related to the production of @xmath0-mesons off the valence quarks in the subprocess @xmath164 . the consideration of such term can be performed with no introduction of additional parameters because the normalization of the cross section is determined by the same factor of @xmath165 .",
    "in contrast to the contribution of @xmath166 subprocess , the contribution of @xmath167 weakly depends on the light quark mass @xmath42 . however , due to the additional condition ( [ prob ] ) relating the values of @xmath42 and @xmath165 the implicit dependence of charm yield on @xmath42 takes place for the production on the valence quark .",
    "so , changing the light quark mass from 0.3 to 0.26  gev the contribution of this subprocess decreases approximately by 1.5 times .",
    "the other terms remain unchanged in this way .",
    "thus , varying the mass @xmath42 we can adjust the contribution of the @xmath168 subprocess due to the normalization factor of @xmath69 , and the slow overestimate of experimental data can be removed by the small correction of @xmath42 value .    at the hera",
    "energies the contribution of valence quarks is about several percents , and in the framework of present paper we consider a further discussion on this question is inappropriate .",
    "we have presented the model for the production of charmed mesons in the positron - proton scattering .",
    "the essential ingredient of consideration is the introduction of fast degrees of freedom inside the heavy meson for both the heavy and light quarks , whose differential characteristics are calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd at the transverse momenta @xmath5 . in the model",
    "the hadronization is described by means of matrix elements in the form of factorizing the hard partonic subprocess and the nonperturbative quark operators corresponding to the transition of quark state into the hadron . in this approach",
    ", the semilocal duality assumes that the differential characteristics of quark pair composing the meson repeat the distributions of hadron in the region of applicability of perturbative qcd @xmath5 . at large @xmath18 , as we expect from the common theorem on the factorization of hard processes , the cross section has the form of convolution for the cross section of heavy quark production with the fragmentation function .",
    "the region of @xmath1 is described by additional terms different from the fragmentation .",
    "they have the asymptotics @xmath91 .",
    "we enhance the charm yield in this region due to the contribution coming from the color - octet @xmath169-state .    within the model uncertainties",
    "we have described the data on the photoproduction and electroproduction of @xmath0-mesons at the hera energies as well as the data on the total cross sections of charm photoproduction at fixed target .",
    "the improvement of @xmath0-meson spectrum description in the present model in comparison with other approaches is achieved due to the clear physical effect : the interaction of virtual @xmath2-quark with the fast light quark is increased in the color - octet state by the diagrams of recombination in the charm production at @xmath20 . at",
    "large @xmath85 this contribution becomes negligible and the fragmentation regime dominates .",
    "it is worth to mention that in our approach the calculation of light quark distribution at large @xmath20 has been done perturbatively .",
    "if one neglects the interference terms , then this mechanism for the enhancement of charm yield in the forward direction can be interpreted as the @xmath2-quark interaction with the hadronic remainder ( the sea of light quarks ) , which increase the forward production ( so - called `` drag - effect '' ) @xcite .",
    "we insist on the use of ` fragmentation ' term as not equivalent to ` hadronization ' in a general case .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "5 shows the most successful theoretical description of rapidity distributions for the photoproduction of @xmath0 , and the deviations at large rapidities are not so dramatic as in other calculations cited above .",
    "they explored a point of view coming from a believement : the hadronization implies the fragmentation . in order to describe the fragmentation of heavy quark , nothing",
    "is required beyond the perturbative qcd cross section of single heavy quark convoluted with a well - justified function by peterson et al .",
    ", say . to consider the general hadronization of fast components in the heavy meson",
    ", one should introduce some physical quantities defining the fastness ( cut off low virtualities , or the constituent mass of light quark ) and the general probabilities to find the fast components inside the meson in the color singlet and octet states .",
    "so , the model parameters are degenerate into the minimal number ( 3 ) of unavoidable quantities in the hadronization of heavy meson .",
    "moreover , the data on the electon - positron annihilation into @xmath0 fix the sum of octet and singlet terms .",
    "the normalization of cross section for the photoproduction of @xmath0 at large transverse momenta and high energies of photon - nucleon collisions restricts the variation of constituent mass , while the @xmath85-distribution measures the normalization of octet contribution .",
    "then we reproduce the differential cross sections on the rapidity in various ranges of transverse momenta ( 3 distributions ) and photon - nucleon collision energies as well as in dis ( 6 distributions ) with a good accuracy .",
    "this fact implies the success of the model in contrast to other qcd - inspired approaches based on the fragmentation : they use the variation of charmed quark mass to get a good normalization with large diviations in distributions or fit the high @xmath85 distribution with a loss of correct noramalization of integrated cross section .",
    "it is quite evident that the offered scheme of evaluation for the additional contribution into the production of heavy mesons can be transformed to the case of hadronic production . in this sense",
    ", it would be of interest to compare such estimates with the data on the @xmath28-meson yield at the fnal tevatron , which we plan to make in the forthcoming papers .",
