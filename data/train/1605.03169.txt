    "this supports our semiclassical description of quench - induced transport .",
    "for the lattice depth used in our simulations , the saturation timescale is smaller than the lowest - band tunneling time by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the higher - band physics at play in this transport process comes from our use of strong interactions @xcite as well as from the quench itself @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have taken a wave - function - based approach to describe the correlation waves induced by an interaction quench .",
    "our calculations made use of the zero - range approximation for particle - particle interactions , represented here with a scattering - length - dependent boundary condition at vanishing particle separation . within this approximation ,",
    "the interaction quench disturbs the boundary and generates a wave that propagates ballistically to nonzero particle separations .",
    "we have derived the leading - order behavior of this wave in momentum space for one , two , and three spatial dimensions .",
    "these results are intuitive in that the amplitude of the correlation wave depends only on the initial amplitude at the boundary and the scattering length before and after the quench . in each dimensionality",
    ", the ballistic contribution to the wave function dominates the next - to - leading - order terms that occur in equilibrium systems .",
    "particularly interesting is the fact that , in one dimension , the @xmath27 tail of the momentum - space wave function is generally determined by both short - range and ballistic effects .",
    "similar results can occur in two and three dimensions , depending on the quench sequence .",
    "it is significant that a protocol as simple as a quench can surprise the intuition that usually associates large - momentum behavior exclusively with short - range physics . on this account ,",
    "our two - body calculations indicate that one must exercise care when interpreting the contact out of equilibrium .",
    "our simulations reveal that quench - induced correlation waves can cause considerable transport in a 1d optical lattice .",
    "the amount of transport that takes place is readily tunable by altering the initial short - range pair probability of the state , as well as the strength of the quench .",
    "our analytic two - body calculation makes possible a semiclassical framework within which both the transport and the saturation time can be estimated with surprising accuracy .",
    "we expect that similar results hold for optical - lattice systems in higher dimensionalities whose numerical calculations are more challenging",
    ". it would be interesting to see what role these ballistic dynamics might play in a quenched many - body system .",
    "for example , the system described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was essentially a mott insulator of molecules in a lattice , might have phase coherence partially restored by the colliding ballistic waves that a quench might generate .",
    "one can expect generally that ballistic waves should be damped by collisions in a many - body system .",
    "this damping is difficult to model quantitatively without introducing a certain amount of arbitrariness to the theory @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is the crux of the question of how isolated quantum many - body systems equilibrate despite the high level of excitation provided by a quench . it may be possible to shed light on the matter by investigating how ballistic waves collide even at the few - body level",
    "this remains for future work .",
    "j.p.c and j.l.b recognize support from the ndseg fellowship program and the nsf , respectively .",
    "we acknowledge helpful conversations with k. r. a. hazzard .",
    "in this appendix , we focus on the two - body solution for interacting particles in one dimension . the solutions for other dimensionalities can be found in essentially the same manner . we simplify expressions by scaling distances by an arbitrary length scale @xmath126 and energies by @xmath127 . in free space , the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the relative wave function @xmath25 is @xmath128 where @xmath4 is the 1d scattering length after the quench . without loss of generality",
    ", we will consider the particles to be identical bosons .",
    "symmetrization then requires that the relative wave function satisfy @xmath129 .",
    "the overall effect of the interaction is to enforce the log - derivative boundary condition shown in eq .  .",
    "we can propagate a given initial condition @xmath130 in time by expanding in the energy eigenstates that satisfy the post - quench log - derivative boundary condition .",

    "we will assume that @xmath130 is normalizable and smooth everywhere except possibly for a nontrivial log - derivative at @xmath22 .",
    "it is most convenient to solve for the momentum - space wave function , as in eq .  .",

    "[ fig : contour ] , the contribution from the @xmath152 arc vanishes .",
    "the only poles that can contribute residues must come from the analytic continuation of the scattering projection inside the integration loop . we have found empirically that , if @xmath130 decays smoothly and without oscillation ( such as for a bound state or a ground - state busch wave function @xcite ) , the integrand is analytic inside the closed contour and the integral vanishes @xcite .",
    "the two straight legs of the integral then cancel , and we can rewrite eq .   as an integral along @xmath153 for real , nonnegative @xmath154 : @xmath155_{k'\\mapsto z\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4 } } } \\\\ & = \\frac{4i\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}}{k^2}\\int\\limits_0^\\infty dz \\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{-z^2t}}{1+iz^2/k^2}z^2 \\\\ & \\quad\\quad \\times \\left[a_{k'}\\left\\langle \\left . \\psi_{k'}^{(s)}(x')\\right| \\psi(x',0 ) \\right\\rangle   \\right]_{k'\\mapsto z\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4 } } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor in brackets has been analytically continued .",
    "this quantity can be evaluated in closed form for several interesting cases , including where @xmath130 is an arbitrary bound - state wave function , although the expressions are generally too lengthy to usefully write down .",
    "the physical significance of @xmath156 can be seen if one compares it with the zero - range contribution to the scattered wave function , @xmath157 .",
    "using eq .  , we can write the result as @xmath158_{k'\\mapsto z\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4 } } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have again exploited the integration contour in fig .",
