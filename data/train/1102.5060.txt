    "one of the key qualitative properties of a packing is whether it is jammed , that is , whether the particles are locked into place .",
    "jamming is of obvious scientific importance if we are using the packing to model a granular material .",
    "furthermore , it plays a central role in studying local optimality of packings , because one natural way to try to improve a packing is to deform it so as to open up more space .",
    "jamming has been extensively studied for packings in euclidean space .",
    "see , for example , torquato and stillinger  @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "however , it has been less thoroughly investigated in other geometries . in this paper",
    ", we investigate jamming for sphere packings in spherical geometry , that is , packings of caps on the surface of a sphere .",
    "jamming has previously been studied for sphere packings in @xmath2 ( see tarnai and gspr  @xcite ) , but there seems to have been little investigation in higher dimensions .",
    "a packing of congruent spherical caps on the unit sphere @xmath3 in @xmath4 yields a _",
    "spherical code _ ( that is , a finite subset of @xmath3 ) consisting of the centers of the caps .",
    "the _ minimal distance _ of such a code is the smallest angular separation between distinct points in the code . in other words , the cosine of the minimal distance is the greatest inner product between distinct points in the code .",
    "the _ packing radius _ is half the minimal distance , because spherical caps of this radius centered at the points of the code will not overlap , except tangentially .",
    "a spherical code is _ optimal _ if its minimal distance is as large as possible , given the dimension of the code and the number of points it contains .",
    "( note that this notion of optimality is different from requiring that no more caps of the same size can be added without causing overlap .",
    "neither of these two notions implies the other . )",
    "spherical codes arise naturally in many parts of mathematics and science ( see cohn  @xcite for a more extensive discussion ) .",
    "for example , in @xmath5 they model pores in pollen grains or colloidal particles adsorbing to the surface of a droplet in a emulsion formed by two immiscible liquids . in higher dimensions",
    ", they can be used as error - correcting codes for a constant - power radio transmitter .",
    "furthermore , many beautiful spherical codes arise in lie theory , discrete geometry , or the study of the sporadic finite simple groups .",
    "a _ deformation _ of a spherical code is a continuous motion of the points such that the minimal distance never drops below its initial value .",
    "a deformation is an _ unjamming _ if it does not simply consist of applying global isometries ( that is , the pairwise distances do not all remain constant ) .",
    "a spherical code is called _ rigid _ or _ jammed _ if it has no unjamming .",
    "it is called _ locally jammed _ if no single point can be continuously moved while all the others are held fixed .",
    "for example , in the face - centered cubic packing of balls in @xmath5 , the _ kissing configuration _ ( that is , points of tangency on a given ball ) consists of the vertices of a cuboctahedron .",
    "this code is locally jammed , but it is not in fact jammed ( see conway and sloane  @xcite or below ) .",
    "however , it can be deformed into an optimalspherical code , namely the vertices of a regular icosahedron , and the icosahedron is then a rigid code with a higher minimal distance than that of the cuboctahedron .",
    "as this example shows , deforming a spherical code is one way to improve it .",
    "some optimal codes are not jammed ; for example , the best five - point codes in @xmath2 consist of two antipodal points and three points orthogonal to them , and the three points can move freely as long as they remain separated by at least an angle of @xmath6 . furthermore ,",
    "computer experiments suggest that an optimal code can have _ rattlers _ , that is , points not in contact with any other point , although no such case has ever been rigorously analyzed .",
    "however , despite these issues , rigidity is a powerful criterion for understanding when acode can be improved .",
    "note that whether a configuration is jammed depends on the ambient space .",
    "for example , the vertices of a square are jammed in @xmath7 but not in @xmath2 .    for infinite packings in euclidean space , there are more subtle distinctions between different types of jamming ( see bezdek , bezdek and connelly  @xcite and torquato and stillinger  @xcite ) based on what sorts of motions are allowed .",
    "for example , are all but finitely many particles held fixed ?",
    "are shearing motions allowed ? however , these issues do not arise for packings in compact spaces .",
    "nevertheless , jamming seems to be a more subtle phenomenon on spheres than it is in euclidean space . in euclidean space",
    ", there is an efficient algorithm to test for jamming ( see donev , torquato , stillinger and connelly  @xcite ) but on spheres we do not know such an algorithm .",
    "the difficulty is caused by curvature , which complicates certain arguments .",
    "for example , in euclidean space every infinitesimal unjamming extends to an actual unjamming , as we will explain in , but the corresponding procedure does not work on spheres .    .",
    "the best lower bounds known for kissing numbers in up to thirty - two dimensions .",
    "numbers in bold are known to be optimal ( see schtte and van der waerden  @xcite , leventen  @xcite , odlyzko and sloane  @xcite and musin  @xcite ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we do not expect that these bounds are anywhere close to being optimal , and already in @xmath8 they are worse than the previous record : they give @xmath9 , while the record is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 would be required to break the record ) . however ,",
    "our bounds improve upon all cases from dimension @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude with some open problems .",
    "the most basic is whether there are spherical codes that span the ambient space and are jammed but not infinitesimally jammed .",
    "we suspect that there are such codes , but we have not found one . a related question is how to test efficiently whether a code is jammed ( which would be possible if jamming and infinitesimal jamming were equivalent , although one could hope for even faster algorithms ) .",
    "such an algorithm might be based on higher - order variants of infinitesimal jamming , but they are far more subtle than one might expect ( see connelly and servatius  @xcite ) .    our new kissing records in dimensions @xmath0 through @xmath1 can presumably be improved , and it would be very interesting to know how far these techniques can be pushed , or how to construct much better arrangements .",
    "the ratio of the upper bounds from shtrom  @xcite to the lower bounds proved here grows roughly like @xmath12 in @xmath13 dimensions for @xmath14 , so there is considerable room for improvement .",
    "note that optimizing the sizes of the sets @xmath15 and @xmath16 from can be viewed as maximizing the size of cliques in highly symmetrical graphs .",
    "finding large cliques is np - hard in general , but that does not settle the question of how well one can solve this problem in practice",
    ".    among kissing problems in low dimensions , dimensions @xmath17 through @xmath18 seem ripe for improvement , although it is unlikely that the approach we have used here can be made to work .",
    "dimension @xmath19 is particularly interesting , and we would very much like to know whether the @xmath20 minimal vectors of the barnes  wall lattice solve the kissing problem .",
    "they are certainly not the unique solution , because we have found that at least one of the @xmath19dimensional packings constructed by conway and sloane  @xcite has a different kissing configuration of the same size .",
    "it seems unlikely that one could classify all the possibilities in @xmath21 , but it might be possible to extend the conjecturally exhaustive list from to higher dimensions , perhaps up through @xmath22 .    in we gave a list of the best kissing configurations known in @xmath23 through @xmath22 , but we suspect even more such configurations remain to be found .",
    "as mentioned in that section , the @xmath24 root system fits into the same framework .",
    "in fact its three other competitors do too , in the following sense . in each case",
    ", one can find a cross polytope contained in the configuration ( for example , by a randomized , greedy algorithm ) .",
    "using it to define the coordinate system yields simple rational coordinates for each point . in the @xmath24 case , these coordinates come from a constant weight code . in the other three cases they do not , but the coordinates can be obtained by a systematic mutation of the @xmath24 case . perhaps one could obtain additional kissing configurations in nine through twelve dimensions via a similar construction .",
    "the problem of rigidity naturally generalizes to many other ambient spaces , such as projective spaces , but this generalization presents new and interesting features . for example , a projective configuration is not determined by its pairwise distance matrix , and in complex projective space there are even continuous families of optimal codes with exactly the same pairwise distances ( see cohn and kumar  @xcite )",
    ".    even in euclidean space , which is the most thoroughly studied case so far , there are unresolved questions . how can one test whether a periodic packing is jammed ?",
    "if one restricts attention to packings consisting of @xmath25 translates of a lattice ( that is , those with @xmath25 particles per unit cell ) , then one can test for infinitesimal jamming and hence jamming ( see donev , torquato , stillinger and connelly  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the answer may depend on @xmath25 .",
    "for example , the laminated lattice @xmath26 is jammed with @xmath27 ( that is , it can not be deformed as a lattice packing ) , but not with @xmath28 ( giving rise to the fluid diamond packings of conway and sloane  @xcite ) .",
    "we know of no bound for how large @xmath25 must be to detect a lack of rigidity .",
    "finally , we conjecture that in all sufficiently high dimensions , there exist optimal kissing configurations with no contacts whatsoever ( that is , no pairs of points with inner product @xmath29 ) , so they are unjammed in the strongest possible sense .",
    "this phenomenon occurs in @xmath5 , but we know of no higher - dimensional cases .",
    "part of our motivation for making this conjecture is that we know of no large , jammed kissing configurations at all in high dimensions .",
    "the @xmath30 root system is jammed for @xmath31 , but it contains only @xmath32 points , which is tiny compared with the exponential growth of the kissing number ( see , for example , conway and sloane  @xcite ) .",
    "are there exponentially large jammed kissing configurations in high dimensions ?",
    "are there even any of greater than quadratic size ?",
    "for example , is the kissing configuration of the barnes  wall lattice @xmath33 in @xmath34 always jammed ?",
    "( it has size asymptotic to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a constant @xcite . )",
    "we thank kroly bezdek , noam elkies , michel goemans and achill schrmann for helpful discussions , patric stergrd for providing computer files for best s constant weight codes , and an anonymous referee for providing useful feedback on the manuscript .",
    "abhinav kumar was supported in part by national science foundation grants dms-0757765 and dms-0952486 and by a grant from the solomon buchsbaum research fund , and he thanks princeton university for its hospitality .",
    "yang jiao and salvatore torquato were supported in part by nsf grants dms-0804431 and dmr-0820341 .",
    "as supplementary information for this paper , we have made available sixteen data files through the ` arxiv.org ` e - print archive , where it is paper number http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5060[`arxiv:1102.5060 ` ] .",
    "one can access these files by downloading the source files for the paper .",
    "the data files can also be downloaded from the web page for this article ( http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/gt.2011.15.2235[doi:10.2140/gt.2011.15.2235 ] ) .",
    "ten of them describe the kissing configurations enumerated in .",
    "these files are each named after the corresponding configuration : ` 5-40a.txt ` , ` 5-40b.txt ` , ` 6-72a.txt ` through ` 6-72d.txt ` , and ` 7-126a.txt ` through ` 7-126d.txt ` .",
    "the first line of the file specifies the number @xmath25 of points , and the second line specifies the dimension @xmath37 of the ambient euclidean space .",
    "the third line consists of @xmath37 positive integers @xmath38 ( separated by spaces ) , which are the coefficients of the diagonal quadratic form used to measure distances .",
    "finally , the remaining @xmath25 lines each give the @xmath37 coordinates of one of the points in the configuration ( again separated by spaces ) .",
    "the scaling has been chosen so that all the coordinates will be integers , and the inner product between points @xmath39 and @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 equivalently , if we use the standard inner product , then the @xmath42th coordinate must be scaled by @xmath43 , but phrasing it in terms of changing the inner product avoids the need to use irrational numbers as coordinates .",
    "( there exist different coordinate systems that use only rational numbers , even with the standard inner product , but the coordinates used here are compatible with the fibering construction from . )",
    "note that within each file , all the vectors have the same norm , but they are not unit vectors .",
    "four of the files , namely ` b9-18.txt ` , ` b10-30.txt ` , ` b11-35.txt ` and ` b12-51.txt ` , describe the constant weight binary codes used to build the kissing configurations from in .",
    "the file ` bn-n.txt ` contains all the codes of block length @xmath37 , size @xmath25 , constant weight @xmath44 and minimal distance @xmath44 , up to isomorphism .",
