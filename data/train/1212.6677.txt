    "the weak polar fields during the declining phase of solar activity cycle 23 and the onset of cycle 24 @xcite has meant a more highly warped coronal helmet streamer belt @xcite and consequently , the existence of more pseudostreamers @xcite .",
    "a pseudostreamer is characterized by the coronal arcade above an even number of polarity inversion lines ( pils ) in 2-dimensional axisymmetric configurations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the combination of these two factors has contributed to community interest in pseudostreamers as cme source regions .",
    "for example , two of the recent working groups at the 2012 nsf solar and heliospheric interplanetary environment ( shine ) workshop were entitled ",
    "sympathetic and homologous eruptions in the solar corona \" and  cme triggers : flux emergence , topology , and global environment \" and included significant discussion about the magnetic topology of cme source regions , cme initiation mechanisms , and their interrelation and interdependence .    while there has been some previous statistical studies of cme properties originating from pseudostreamer source regions @xcite , recent modeling @xcite has highlighted this topological aspect and started to investigate the consequences of the source environment on the eruptions .",
    "for example , @xcite have discussed the viability of the breakout mechanism for cme initiation from pseudostreamers , but given the similarity between the magnetic configuration of a pseudostreamer and the topological features necessary for magnetic breakout cme initiation @xcite , we have performed a high resolution 2.5d mhd simulation in order to demonstrate that a completely generic energization scenario can result in the eruption of sympathetic magnetic breakout cmes .",
    "it has been an open question whether breakout - initiated cmes under streamer configurations ( i.e. , breakout reconnection with overlying open fields ) could produce a fast eruption .",
    "the simulation results discussed by @xcite included a @xmath01000  km  s@xmath1 breakout cme from under the helmet streamer belt in a realistic background solar wind .",
    "the results presented herein show that even the pseudostreamer s secondary , sympathetic cme has strong eruptive flare reconnection that accelerates the cme with virtually no overlying closed flux .",

    "the various phases of the sympathetic eruption scenario are also clearly distinguishable in the reconnection rate .",
    "the breakout reconnection is relatively  slow \" compared to the  fast \" reconnection associated with the onset of the eruptive flares .",
    "the time profiles of the flare reconnection rates are qualitatively similar to the hard x - ray profiles associated with the impulsive phase of strong flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    due to the fine - scale structure in and around the current sheet introduced by the island formation and evolution shown in figure  [ fig3 ] and the online animations ,",
    "the localized reconnection rates vary considerably over the length of the current sheet .",
    "for example , during the impulsive phase of the flare reconnection , the whole upper portion of the current sheet in figure  [ fig3](f ) is experiencing fast reconnection with alfvnic reconnection jet outflows of @xmath04000  km  s@xmath1 and localized inflow speeds on the order of 1000  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "future work will include a quantitative analysis of the reconnection properties including the average and localized inflow and outflow speeds , the variability of the field reversals and plasma conditions along the different current sheets , and the formation , evolution of individual , well - resolved magnetic islands and their role in facilitating mass , energy , and flux transfer through the reconnection region .",
    "our 2.5d simulation is highly idealized and so both the structure of the background field and the periodicity affect the cme dynamics considerably .",
    "while the eruption process itself is well resolved and physical , the subsequent eruption dynamics of the cme flux ropes are subject to the limitations of this simulation . without a realistic fall - off in height ( radius ) of the background field ,",
    "the erupting flux ropes continue their breakout reconnection and are eventually completely dissolved into the uniform vertical field .",
    "physically , this is easily understood as the most efficient redistribution of the imposed highly concentrated shear throughout the simulation volume in an attempt to minimize the total magnetic energy of the system . in a background field with an exponential height / radial dependence",
    "faster than or equal to @xmath71 , it is more energetically favorable to eject the flux rope out of the system .",
    "the periodicity also means that both eruptions exit one side of the simulation domain and wrap - around to the other side .",
    "the impact of the remnants of the first eruption on the second eruption s magnetic breakout current sheet development is not important because the pseudostreamer s left arcade expansion and breakout reconnection feedback loop is already well underway ( as seen in figure  [ fig3](c ) , [ fig3](g ) ) . in the current density movie , f3_jmag.mp4",
    ", the first eruption s leading edge is seen to immediately reconnect upon impact with the current sheet facilitating the second cme s breakout reconnection resulting in this flux being transferred out of the way of the sympathetic eruption . despite the inherent limitations of the simulation , there are a number of important features of the results that have implications for our understanding of cme initiation , the role the topology of pseudostreamer source regions play in the eruption process , and predictions of properties that may be observable as pre - eruption signatures from these particular source regions .",
    "the topology of the pseudostreamer means the breakout reconnection transfers flux into the open field directly through interchange reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore could potentially give rise to observable pre - eruption signatures in coronagraph observations of pseudostreamers . in the simulation we see an entire train of plasmoid ejections from the initial breakout reconnection current sheet creating a pre - eruption jet - like outflow up the pseudostreamer stalk as well as blob - like density downflows in the adjacent pseudostreamer arcade",
    ". the breakout reconnection jet s bursty outflow of material into the open field might have a distinct coronagraph signature ( especially in running - difference ) as higher variability or higher frequency intensity fluctuations in the pseudostreamer stalks distinguishable from the nominal steady - state solar wind profile .",
    "observation of downflows in coronagraph , euv , and x - ray imaging have traditionally been associated with plasma and magnetic field dynamics beneath the eruptive flare current sheet ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and modeled as such ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while we certainly have those signatures here , we also see them associated with pre - eruption breakout reconnection .",
    "flux transferred from the runaway expansion half of the pseudostreamer to the adjacent arcade is supplying intermittent density enhancements that stream down the magnetic field lines .",
    "the appearance of such downflows should precede and coincide with the slow rise phase of the filament undergoing eruption .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] top row , panels ( a)(d ) , show the plasma number density @xmath72 in 100  s intervals between 1230 and 1530  s immediately preceding the first cme eruption .",
    "the bottom row , ( e)(h ) , show the running difference density signature , @xmath73 , at each of the above times .",
    "the yellow arrows point to the overlying breakout reconnection exhaust that forms the interchange reconnection outflows .",
    "because the reconnection becomes bursty due to the current sheet tearing and magnetic island formation , the rising outflow front of density enhancement along the vertical background field has a ragged , fine - scale structure .",
    "this interchange reconnection outflow front has a complex running difference signature and each new magnetic island ( density blob ) absorbed into the open field creates a new alternating positive - negative signal .",
    "the green arrows point to the running difference downflows in the adjacent pseudostreamer arcade and the newly interchange - reconnected open fields .",
    "the downflows are more collimated than the upflows and are seen tracing the ( growing ) boundaries of the adjacent arcade and adjacent open fieldlines .",
    "the running difference signatures are relatively narrow alternating positive - negative fronts in regions of vertical field at the edges of the non - erupting flux system and outline the entire arcade loops as they are compressed under the new loops . in the wake of cmes , converging downflows are observed in coronagraphs and euv and x - ray images at the edge of streamers and near the periphery of active regions @xcite , precisely where they are located in our simulation results .",
    "the online animations of figure  [ fig5 ] show the entire eruption process in both number density and running difference ( f5_dens.mp4 , f5_rundiff.mp4 )",
    ".    it will also be interesting to model the bulk plasma heating associated with the breakout reconnection because the plasma material supplied to the adjacent arcade may also have euv or x - ray emission signatures that precede the initial eruption .",
    "in fact , the stereo / euvi signatures of the loops above the central arcade in the well - studied 2007 may 19 cme showed exactly this feature : the pre - eruption brightening and arcade growth ( piling on of new loops ) before the eruption of a filament above the pil of the western arcade of the multipolar flux system @xcite .",
    "additionally , heating during both the breakout and eruptive flare reconnection is important because the coronal density and temperature history of the cme and its surrounding material is imprinted in the spatial variation and complexity of interplanetary cme heavy ionic charge states @xcite .",
    "recent analyses by @xcite suggested that the spatial distribution of in - situ iron charge states in the consecutive 2007 may 2123 icmes were consistent with a sympathetic eruption scenario .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while it has been established , particularly during solar minimum conditions , that cmes tend to be deflected towards the heliospheric current sheet @xcite , recent observational data by @xcite appears to support the hypothesis of @xcite that cme deflection can be predicted and characterized by the local gradient of the magnetic field energy @xmath74",
    "in the model proposed by @xcite the magnetic energy density in the region immediately surrounding the flux rope cme is evaluated , and if , on average , there exists an imbalance in the magnetic energy density , then one might expect a tendency for deflection towards the region of lower magnetic pressure .",
    "the breakout current sheet and associated separatrix surrounding each cme flux rope include a very well defined @xmath75 minimum .",
    "the figure  [ fig3 ] movies show the breakout current sheets aligning themselves with the vertical background field so the @xmath74 maximum becomes parallel to the @xmath4-axis in both eruptions .",
    "the fact that the pseudostreamer topology necessarily includes a null point and flux rope separatrix early in the eruptions could mean pseudostreamer cmes are more susceptible to deflections of this kind .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) plot two snapshots , one from each cme , relatively early in their eruption phases , but after the creation of the flux rope component .",

    "the circular ring surrounding each flux rope plots the smoothed magnetic energy density @xmath76 .",
    "the black arrows show the direction of the flux rope averaged planar velocity , @xmath77 , in the unshaded circle at the center of the each ring approximating the flux rope s center of motion .",
    "qualitatively , the breakout current sheet half of the magnetic energy density ring in each panel is clearly lower than in the opposite half .",
    "panel ( c ) plots the spatial trajectory of each of the cme s flux rope center during their lifetime , i.e. before the flux rope is entirely consumed / reconnected into the background field .",
    "the first cme is shown as red diamonds , the second as blue triangles , and the data points corresponding to panels ( a ) and ( b ) are labeled accordingly . here , both cmes pass through the periodic boundaries and therefore their trajectories appear discontinuous in the plot .",
    "the transition from a more vertical to more horizontal trajectory for the first cme and an almost exclusively horizontal trajectory for the second cme appears consistent with the idea that the energy density minimum associated with the breakout current sheet and its continual reconnection provide a path of least resistance for the cme propagation .",
    "the magnetic islands in the current sheet show up as localized hot spots of enhanced energy density and so may act to impede the flux rope propagation , as was seen in the simulation by @xcite .",
    "however , the island formation and ejection from the reconnection region is highly dynamic and both our results and the @xcite simulations show the islands are both continually moving out of the way of the erupting cme and are much much smaller than the cme flux ropes .",
    "@xcite discussed observations of eruptions from pseudostreamer topologies , including the sympathetic eruptions on 1 august 2010 simulated by @xcite . the deflection ( i.e. , non - radial propagation ) of the prominence material in the early phases of eruption were quantified and showed , at least in some cases , the low coronal trajectories are consistent with being  guided towards weaker field regions , namely null points existing at different heights in the overlying configuration .",
    "\" @xcite also discussed the role of asymmetric forces , including those resulting from the large scale coronal hole structure , in the eruption process . @xcite",

    "the initiation of consecutive , sympathetic eruptions result as a consequence of the source region topology .",
    "we have visualized the complex dynamics of the driven current sheet formation and dissipation via magnetic reconnection and discussed the fine - scale structure of the current sheet fragmentation into a series of x- and o - type nulls , recently investigated by @xcite .",
    "we quantified the flux transfer between the pseudostreamer arcades and in the creation of the post - eruption flare arcades as well as calculated the reconnection rate at the breakout and eruptive flare current sheets , showing that the fast reconnection during the impulsive phase of the eruption corresponds to the rapid conversion of stored magnetic energy into cme kinetic energy and acceleration .",
    "the topology of the coronal pseudostreamer source region may give rise to both observable signatures of the overlying breakout reconnection process that precede the impulsive flare and filament eruption in the form of downflows in the adjacent non - erupting pseudostreamer arcade as well as reconnection - driven outflow along the pseudostreamer arcade stalk .",
    "additionally , the unipolar open field on either side of the pseudostreamer will result in a cme topology early in the eruption that includes a current sheet and magnetic null point ( or series of null points ) along the field - reversal interface between the flux rope and background coronal field . continued breakout reconnection in the low corona when coupled with the natural magnetic energy density minimum of this topology could play a significant role in the observed deflection of high latitude cmes during the eruption process .",
