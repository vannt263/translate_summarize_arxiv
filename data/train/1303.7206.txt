    "once the secondary becomes sufficiently massive it will open an empty annular gap in the disk , analogous to gaps known to exist in protoplanetary disks .",
    "this happens above the critical mass ratio ( e.g. @xcite ) of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the geometric thickness ( aspect ratio ) of the disk and @xmath0 is the disk viscosity parameter @xcite . a black hole with @xmath42 should be able to open a gap in a fiducial agn disk .",
    "this mass range spans massive stars or black holes of @xmath43 in accretion disks around @xmath44 supermassive black holes @xcite , all the way up to supermassive black hole binaries that form long after a major galactic merger has occurred .",
    "the radial extent of the gap would be of order a few hill radii ( @xmath45 ) . in this case , the secondary can be regarded as a particle in the disk , migrating inward on the viscous time - scale ( so - called type ii migration ) .",
    "when the secondary arrives at the radius where the local disk mass is too small to absorb the secondary s angular momentum , its migration must stall ( or at least slow down ) .",
    "an important point is that `` standard '' thin disks have relatively low mass , and this stalling occurs at fairly large binary separations . with the exception of very unequal masses",
    "@xmath46 , the transition takes place well in the outer region of the disk , at @xmath47several @xmath48 . even for @xmath49 binaries",
    ", the transition is located at @xmath50 schwarzschild radii , which may lie outside the region of interest for producing broad fek@xmath0 lines depending on @xmath51 ( the above equation assumes standard disk parameters ; see eqn . 25 in @xcite for the full expression ) .",
    "once inside this stalling radius , the secondary is no longer able to maintain steady type ii migration on the viscous time - scale , and the evolution of the binary+disk system from this point onward becomes very poorly known .",
    "the inner disk - whose viscous time is short - is believed to drain onto the primary , creating a central cavity . continued accretion from larger radii causes a pile - up of gas just outside the secondary s orbit , analogous to a dam in a river @xcite . if the dam is 100% efficient in continuing to block the gas arriving from large radii , then the binary , at small separations , will be surrounded by an empty inner cavity , devoid of any gas .",
    "such inner cavities have been seen in many numerical simulations ( starting with the seminal work by @xcite ) .",
    "however , simulations do not follow the system on long enough timescales to determine whether such a cavity could persist for many viscous times . in the face of ongoing accretion",
    ", an initial cavity may be gradually refilled ( if the `` dam '' is porous ) , or else the gas accumulated outside the orbit may eventually cause the dam to `` burst '' @xcite .",
    "an empty cavity would of course strongly modify the shape of the fek@xmath0 line .",
    "however , this picture is oversimplified .",
    "many numerical simulations imply that gas can enter such a cavity in narrow collimated streams ( @xcite ) .",
    "such streams may feed a `` minidisk '' around the secondary and perhaps also the primary bh @xcite .",
    "a minidisk around the secondary may be favored , but the details depend on the angular momentum and shocks in the material in the streams .",
    "the streamers and minidisks could create some additional fek@xmath0 emission .",
    "for example , if both disks emit , there would be a double fek@xmath0 line ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is unclear whether such streams and minidisks may persist down to small binary separations . at separations of @xmath52 ( see eqn . 30 in @xcite for the full expression , including dependencies on disk parameters ) , the binary bh emits gws efficiently and is driven to merger by this gw emission .",
    "it effectively decouples from the disk ( @xcite ) and `` runs away '' .",
    "the merger timescale is given by @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass of the secondary , @xmath55 is the mass of the primary , @xmath56 is the binary separation and @xmath57 is the secondary orbital eccentricity . for a secondary on a circularized orbit with @xmath58 located at @xmath59 in an agn disk , @xmath60 around a @xmath61 smbh and @xmath62 around a @xmath63 smbh respectively .",
    "simulations in the relativistic regime found that gas streams can follow the binary to small radii ( @xmath64 few @xmath65 ; e.g. @xcite ) , but these simulations start with small binary separations , with gas assumed to have followed the bh to these initial separations .    as emphasized recently by @xcite , even apart from possible streamers and minidisks inside the central cavity , the formation of the cavity itself , at large radii , is still uncertain .",
    "the coupled time - dependent processes of the secondary s migration , inner cavity formation , and damming - up of gas outside the secondary s orbit , has not been modeled self - consistently , even in one - dimensional calculations . however , using self - consistent _ steady - state _",
    "solutions , @xcite have argued that in many cases , pile - up can cause a dam overflow at large binary separations . in this case , when the binary arrives at small radii relevant to the fek@xmath0 line , the gas configuration would presumably resemble a filled disk , with an annular gap ( of order the hill radius ) .",
    "although the above is yet to be demonstrated by a self - consistent calculation , it is at least suggested by recent simulations of @xcite .",
    "this is the only existing simulation that looks at small binary separations , in the gw - driven regime , and does not manually insert an empty cavity in the beginning .",
    "they show that the secondary moves inward , `` ice - skating '' across the inner disk ( with the inner disk material continually crossing the secondary s orbit outward , on horse - shoe orbits ) .",
    "this simulation is in 2d , and assumes a constant kinematic viscosity physics , which may not be accurate .",
    "nevertheless , it suggests that if the cavity filled in at large radius , it will remain filled until the end , except for a narrow annular gap around the secondary .",
    "we are motivated by the above discussion to consider the impact on the fe  k@xmath0 line of four different circumbinary gas disk geometries , all variations on a standard single - bh accretion disk : ( i ) a narrow annular gap around the secondary , ( ii ) an empty central cavity , ( iii ) a central cavity surrounded by an overdense ring ( dam ) , and ( iv ) a central cavity with a small , circumsecondary accretion disk ( minidisk ) inside it .",
    "we regard ( i ) as our fiducial case , addressing it first in ",
    "[ sec : intro_ripple ] and  [ sec : vars ] .",
    "we then examine the alternative scenarios ( ii)-(iv ) in  [ sec : vars_models ] .",
    "as a gap - opening black hole migrates inward in an agn disk , the empty gap spans parts of the disk that produce ever bluer and redder parts of the broad fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "therefore we expect flux notches to be removed from the broad line profile .",
    "as the annulus moves inward on the disk viscous timescale , we expect the notches to ripple red - ward and blue - ward respectively from the line centroid .",

    "if we change @xmath51 to larger radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the broad line profiles depicted throughout this paper would appear more centrally peaked with horns closer together , resulting in a slight decrease in the prominence of the notches and oscillations described here .",
    "if @xmath51 is larger , we become sensitive to stalling radii , gaps and cavities further out in the accretion disk .",
    "exactly how sensitive to detection of the effects discussed here depends on the line emissivity ( @xmath75 ) profile .",
    "if the emissivity profile is steep ( @xmath76 ) then most line flux originates close to the bh and we have low sensitivity to features in the disk much further than @xmath77 . if the emissivity profile is shallower ( @xmath78 ) , for large @xmath51 , the line horns correspond to material around @xmath79 , so gaps at these radii could be detected . in general , our simple assumption that the broad line flux comes from @xmath80 ) , is reasonably consistent with fits to many observed broad line components @xcite .",
    "likewise , in the following discussion we do not correctly treat general relativistic effects such as light - bending , blurring and bh spin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these effects , if properly treated , will tend to smear out sharper notches in the red wing of the broad fek@xmath0 line and modify line flux originating from @xmath81 .",
    "even though we ignore the many possible confounding effects ( e.g. continuum absorption , the location and variation of the continuum source , broken axi - symmetry ) , we expect that the kinds of spectral features here are broadly robust and allow us to take a first step in characterizing different scenarios of merging massive black holes in the inner accretion disk .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : feka ] , the progression of the ripple effect is quite clear .",
    "as the satellite black hole and gap migrate into the inner @xmath69 of the disk , a flux deficit appears ( turquoise solid curve ) compared to the unperturbed profile ( black solid curve ) .",
    "as migration continues , matching notches are removed from the broad red wing and the blue wing of the profile , with the deepest notches in the blue wing .",

    ", we see a much more pronounced oscillation between the red and blue horns of the total observed broad line component . here , the line centroid energy of the secondary oscillates between @xmath203kev and @xmath204kev .",
    "this oscillation can occur on the very short secondary orbital timescales ( few-10s of ks in agn with a primary @xmath205 ) and could easily be detected during an extended observation with _ astro - h_. thus , the deeper the secondary accretion disk in the cavity , the easier it is to observe the oscillation effect .",
    "[ fig:2nddisk30rg ] looks quite different from the results of @xcite ( their fig .",
    "10 ) , where there are two laor model disk components , corresponding to a @xmath206 total - mass binary , with the secondary blue - shifted by @xmath207 ( corresponding to a separation of @xmath208 ) , much larger than the separations discussed here .",
    "the apparent difference is mostly driven by the lack of horns in the profiles in @xcite which is due to their choice of steeper emissivity profile @xmath209 ( see e.g. fig.10 in @xcite for the impact of this choice on broad line profile ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xmm ] we simulate a @xmath210ks observation with _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn of an agn at @xmath211 with a 2 - 10kev photon flux of @xmath212 .",
    "we ignore the narrow line component in the model in order to illustrate the difference in best - fits to observations ; in practice this model component would need to be fit to the data too .",
    "the xspec toy model was simply zphabs(zpowerlw+diskline+diskline ) where the absorbing hydrogen column was @xmath213 and the powerlaw index was @xmath214 .",
    "the primary diskline was centered at 6.40kev and due to a truncated inner disk from 50 - 100@xmath82 , with @xmath215 and emissivity @xmath216 as above , and a line normalization of @xmath217 with respect to the continuum .",
    "the secondary diskline had similar parameters to the primary diskline except it ran from 6 - 100@xmath189 , where @xmath189 represents gravitational radii of the secondary .",
    "we set the normalization of the secondary diskline to @xmath218 of the primary to illustrate the difference between the best fits to two simulated observations .",
    "the simulated data in in fig .  [ fig : sim_xmm ] corresponds to line centroid of the secondary at 7.3kev and the blue solid line is the best model fit to the data . the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xmm ] corresponds to the best model fit when the line centroid of the secondary lies at 5.2kev , although we do not show the simulated data in the latter case for ease of presentation .",
    "flux differences in the red wing between the two models in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_xmm ] differ by a few percent and the key observational test in this case is that the best - fit model must oscillate between the blue and red curves on a regular orbital timescale . as we can see , even in two long simulated exposures with _ xmm - newton _ and a relatively intense secondary disk component , it is difficult to disentangle the secondary disk component , even if we bin up the data .",
    "however , repeated observations of bright agn can build up statistical significance in the red and blue wings , allowing us to track the oscillation of the secondary over time .",
    "thus , observations of agn in the fe  k band with _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn should be searched for serendipitous oscillations .",
    "a systematic study of models of secondary disks in agn could be carried out with _ loft _ since the proposed effective area ( @xmath219 ) is an order of magnitude larger than _ xmm - newton _ and the spectral resolution ( @xmath220kev ) is sufficient for coarse binning of the red and blue wings of the broad fe k@xmath0 line . for disentangling competing effects , ideally a large area high resolution ( _ lahr _ ) telescope",
    "should be used , with effective area greater than that of _ loft _ _ together _ with the proposed spectral resolution of _ ixo / athena_.",
    "observations of a ripple effect or periodic oscillations in the broad fek@xmath0 line will be an excellent leading indicator of gravitational radiation which can be detected directly independently .",
    "depending on the orbital period of the binary , the gws emitted by a supermassive black hole binary are detectable with pulsar timing or a space - based laser - interferometric instrument like lisa or ngo .",
    "the gw measurement can constrain the source parameters completely independently of the electromagnetic signal with different systematics . furthermore",
    ", the gw measurement may independently indicate the presence of ambient gas around the binary as discussed below .",
    "a serendipitous binary detection in one channel can be used to do a targeted search in the other for verification @xcite .",
    "the comparison of these measurements can provide a consistency check for the central mass , inclination , and orbital radius .",
    "the combination of the electromagnetic and gw measurements may allow us to constrain the geometry of the accretion disk and the binary . in this section",

    "the distance to the source and the binary inclination then follows from the amplitudes of the two gw polarizations @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the sky position of the source can be inferred by measuring the gw strain coincidentally over multiple baselines .",
    "pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) can measure gws of periods weeks to years ( or frequencies between nhz to mhz ) by detecting correlated variations in the time - of - arrivals ( toas ) of pulses in millisecond pulsars in the galaxy . at these periods",
    "the binaries are relatively far from merger , so only four quantities are measurable for most of the sources : the gw amplitudes of the two polarizations ( see eq .",
    "[ e : gw ] ) , the orbital period , and the eccentricity , but not the inspiral rate or @xmath227 .",
    "however , the inspiral rate may be measurable for some sources @xcite . in the case of pta detections",
    ", we expect to detect the binary when it is close to decoupling from the disk @xcite and therefore the signature of a gap or cavity in the broad fe  k@xmath0 line caused by disk drainage ( outlined above ) should be clearest .",

    "these observations are mostly sensitive to the total stochastic background generated by many supermassive black hole binaries across the universe at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "however the gws of massive nearby binaries ( e.g. @xmath229 within @xmath2302 ) are expected to rise well above the background level and may be individually resolved @xcite .",
    "the individually detectable binaries are expected to be orbiting at separations @xmath231 , where gas - driven migration is subdominant relative to gravitational wave losses @xcite .",

    "these binaries are expected to open a large cavity in the disk .",
    "the fek@xmath0 profiles may show a double structure if the non - axisymmetric streams can penetrate the gap and create an accretion disk around the binary components @xcite .",
    "these binaries may also exhibit periodic electromagnetic variability @xcite . with large cavities expected to be excavated in the inner disk",
    ", we expect to simultaneously detect broad fe  k@xmath0 profiles in these agn similar to the individual curves shown in   [",
    "sec : vars_models ] .",
    "if we are lucky enough to detect a massive binary via pta as the cavity is forming , we will simultaneously observe the variable broad fe  k@xmath0 profiles , together with ripple effects and oscillations outlined in ",
    "[ sec : vars_models ] .",
    "since the inspiral rate is typically not available for these sources , one can not directly measure the effects of gas for individual binaries from pta observations .",
    "gas driven migration may leave an imprint on the stochastic gw background by reducing the number of binaries in the universe at large separations @xcite . for individual binaries , the effects of an accretion disk may be inferred from the gw signal indirectly by measuring a large orbital eccentricity and the absence of spin - orbit precession .",
    "the angular momentum exchange with an accretion disk leads to the excitation of orbital eccentricity for widely separated binaries if a cavity forms in the disk , while the eccentricity is predicted to quickly decrease in the absence of an accretion disk or during the later stages of the inspiral due to gw emission .",
    "however , the eccentricity is also increased by scattering of stars @xcite , albeit to a smaller level .",
    "the eccentricity may be detected with ptas @xcite .",
    "smbh binaries with a large orbital eccentricity may be indicative of an accretion disk .",
    "secondly , spin - orbit precession may also be detectable if the spins are not aligned with the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "such a configuration would argue against the presence of a gas disk , which tends to align the binary spins @xcite .",
    "lisa / ngo will be sensitive to much smaller periods between 10 hours to seconds , which corresponds to frequencies from @xmath233 to 1hz and smbh masses of @xmath234@xmath235 at separations from @xmath236 down to merger . in this frequency range ,",
    "the inspiral of smbh binaries is much more rapid and the astrophysical stochastic gw background is much more quiet , dominated by galactic white dwarf binaries @xcite . in this case , for a massive binary very close to merger , if an annulus is maintained in the disk , we expect to simultaneously observe a broad fe  k@xmath0 component in the late stage of the ripple effect ( e.g. the red curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : feka ] ) .",
    "if instead , the binary merger is occurring within a cavity , we expect a strongly dammed cavity inner wall , and a simultaneous fe  k@xmath0 broad line profile similar to the green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : dam_disk_cav ] .",
    "the gw signal of an imbh or an smbh spiraling into a smbh is much stronger than the background level , and may be detected to high significance to high redshifts ( @xmath237 for comparable mass ratio binaries , @xcite ) .",
    "a sensitive measurement of the inspiral waveform for the two gw polarizations can be used to infer the binary masses and orbital parameters to a relative accuracy better than @xmath238 for a signal to noise of 30 @xcite . the source localization accuracy with",
    "lisa / ngo is typically a few degrees several months before merger @xcite .",
    "this improves to a few tens of arcminutes for comparable ",
    "mass spinning binaries approaching the isco at @xmath239 if the spins are not aligned with the disk @xcite .",
    "if the disk plane and the binary spin align @xcite , there is no spin - orbit precession feature in the gw signal , and the binary localization becomes worse by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "this error volume however is still sufficiently small to allow a unique identification of an agn counterpart @xcite .    due to the high signal to noise ratio and the large number of orbital cycles observable with lisa / ngo ( @xmath240 ) ,",
    "the imprints of gas effects may be detected directly by measuring the corresponding perturbations of the gw phase @xcite .",
    "the largest perturbation is due to the spiral density waves excited by the binary which removes angular momentum from the binary analogous to planetary migration .",
    "further perturbations arise due to the hydrodynamic drag on the secondary and the mass increase of the secondary due to accretion .",
    "these effects are more significant for smaller secondary masses . for an extreme mass ratio binary , @xmath241 , the gw phase shift due to the spiral waves",
    "are expected to be measurable with lisa during the last year of inspiral @xcite .",
    "the gw measurements may be directly sensitive to the presence of a gap since a gap affects the gaseous torques acting on the binary , and hence , the gw phase .    for comparable mass - ratio binaries ,",
    "gas effects are much less significant , only detectable by second generation space - based instruments like decigo or bbo @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the merger may take place in a central empty cavity in the disk where the gaseous torques are negligible .",
    "however , eccentricity of order @xmath242 to @xmath217 in lisa / ngo detections may be an indirect signature of an earlier coupling with a massive circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "lisa / ngo will allow to measure the eccentricity to a much higher accuracy @xmath243 @xcite .",
    "if a gap - opening , migrating black hole ends up in the innermost regions of an agn disk , analogous to a gap - opening hot jupiter in a protoplanetary disk , a unique and predictable pattern of variability appears in the broad component of the fe  k@xmath0 line . the ripple effect and oscillations in the fe  k@xmath0 line outlined in this paper",
    "are potentially detectable in long exposures with future missions such as _ astro - h _ , _ ixo / athena _ and _ loft_. oscillations may be detectable in long , repeated exposures with _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn , such as may be found for popular sources in the archive . here",
    "we have shown the range of ripple effects observable as a function of disk and merger properties , including inclination to observers sightline , gap - width ( or cavity size ) , disk emissivity profile , damming of the accretion flow and a mini - disk around the secondary black hole .",
    "detection of a ripple effect or periodic oscillations in the broad component of fe  k@xmath0 from an agn will provide advance warning of gravitational waves due to an impending merger in this agn .",
    "for example , an observation of a broad fek@xmath0 line ripple profile given by the dashed red - curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : feka ] from a supermassive black hole of mass @xmath44 predicts a merger event in this source within a year .",
    "once gravitational waves consistent with a binary black hole merger are detected , an archival search for a ripple effect or oscillations in a broad fek@xmath0 line will help localize the gravitational wave detection .",

    "<S> when a sufficiently massive satellite ( or secondary ) black hole is embedded in a gas disk around a ( primary ) supermassive black hole , it can open an empty gap in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> a gap - opening secondary close to the primary will leave an imprint in the broad component of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line , which varies in a unique and predictable manner . </S>",
    "<S> if the gap persists into the innermost disk , the effect consists of a pair of dips in the broad line which ripple blue - ward and red - ward from the line centroid energy respectively , as the gap moves closer to the primary . </S>",
    "<S> this ripple effect could be unambiguously detectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole mergers as they occur . </S>",
    "<S> as the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole increases to @xmath1 , we expect the gap to widen , possibly clearing a central cavity in the inner disk , which shows up in the broad fe  k@xmath0 line component . </S>",
    "<S> if the secondary stalls at @xmath2 in its in - migration , due to low co - rotating gas mass , a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the disk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed . if the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity , due to dam bursting or leakage , a periodic see - saw oscillation effect is exhibited in the observed line profile . here we demonstrate the range of ripple effect signatures potentially detectable with _ astro - h _ and _ ixo / athena _ , and oscillation effects potentially detectable with _ xmm - newton _ or _ loft _ for a wide variety of merger and disk conditions , including gap width ( or cavity size ) , disk inclination angle and emissivity profile , damming of the accretion flow by the secondary , and a mini - disk around the satellite black hole . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic study of ripple effects would require a telescope effective area substantially larger than that planned for _ ixo / athena_. future mission planning should take this into account . </S>",
    "<S> observations of the ripple effect and periodic oscillations can be used to provide an _ early warning _ of gravitational radiation emission from the agn . once gravitational waves consistent with massive black hole mergers are detected , an archival search for </S>",
