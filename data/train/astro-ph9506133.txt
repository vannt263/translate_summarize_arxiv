    "much of the current research on solar cosmic rays aims to determine the time distribution of their emission during solar flares .",
    "the major obstacle is that no spacecraft has approached closer than @xmath1 au from the sun , so interplanetary scattering has greatly broadened the observed temporal distributions .",
    "this problem is least severe when the detector is magnetically reasonably well - connected to the flare .",
    "if strong anisotropies are observed , they also aid the determination of the scattering mean free path and the injection profile ( kallenrode , wibberenz , and hucke 1992 ) .",
    "the key phenomenon underlying the strong anisotropy observed for many well - connected events is that charged particles of a given energy tend to travel together as a highly anisotropic `` coherent pulse , '' which can survive long enough to be observed near the earth .",
    "figure 1 shows stages in the formation of such a pulse very close to the sun .",
    "this phenomenon was first systematically described by earl ( 1974 , 1976a , b ) who used analytic approximations to describe their formation and decay . however , that description was limited by the assumption of a constant focusing length , implying an exponentially decaying magnetic field strength .",
    "here we re - examine the evolution of coherent pulses of solar cosmic rays using numerical simulations for a more realistic archimedean spiral field ( parker 1958 ) .",
    "for ions of @xmath2 mev / n or electrons of @xmath3 kev , the transport along the interplanetary magnetic field is well described by the following equation ( using the notation of ng & wong 1979 ) : @xmath4    \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mu}\\left[\\frac{\\varphi(\\mu)}{2 }    \\frac{\\partial f(t,\\mu , z)}{\\partial\\mu}\\right ] ,    \\label{eq : tr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the arclength along the magnetic field , @xmath6 is the cosine of the pitch angle ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the distribution function , defined as the number of particles per @xmath5 per @xmath6 in a given magnetic flux tube , @xmath9 is the focusing length , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the coefficient of pitch - angle scattering . the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr ] ) expresses the streaming of particles along the magnetic field .",
    "the second term is due to pitch - angle scattering from irregularities in the magnetic field , and the final term is due to adiabatic focusing ( roelof 1969 ) .",
    "we derive the focusing length , @xmath12 , from an archimedean spiral field that makes a 45  angle with the radial direction at a radius of 1 au , corresponding to a solar wind speed of @xmath13 km / s .",
    "the pitch - angle scattering coefficient , @xmath14 , is parameterized as @xmath15 following jokipii ( 1971 ) .",
    "we express our results in terms of the scattering mean free path , @xmath16 , which is given by @xmath17 note that for a constant value of @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr ] ) involves only the distance traveled , @xmath18 , and not @xmath19 or @xmath20 alone .",
    "we will therefore show results in terms of @xmath21 instead of time .",
    "the numerical method used to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr ] ) was essentially the finite difference method of ruffolo ( 1991 ) , with some minor improvements .",
    "that study described tests of the code and successful fits to the observed intensity and pitch - angle distribution as a function of time for neutron - decay protons .",
    "more recently , this and two completely different numerical methods were shown to give very similar results ( earl et al .",
    "numerical simulations were performed for an initial condition corresponding to an instantaneous injection of particles near the sun at @xmath22 . for most of the simulations , we took the initial pitch - angle distribution to be concentrated at the highest @xmath6-grid value , and used an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 was set to zero .",
    "( the injection site and inner boundary , @xmath23 , was set to @xmath25 au @xmath26 to avoid a divergence in the focusing term . )",
    "the outer boundary was set to the maximum value of @xmath18 .",
    "finally , the grid spacings were @xmath27 au , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 au except where noted .    to examine the propagation of coherent pulses , we plot the average distance along the magnetic field of the particle distribution , @xmath30 , as a function of @xmath18 for selected values of @xmath16 and @xmath31 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the dashed line , @xmath32 , shows where the particles would be if they all traveled directly along the magnetic field , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as expected , the progress along the magnetic field is fastest for the longest mean free path , corresponding to the weakest scattering .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath21 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the anisotropy averaged over the particle distribution , so @xmath37 is proportional to the pulse s propagation speed and anisotropy .",
    "figure  3a shows the evolution of @xmath37 as a function of the average position , @xmath30 .",
    "the most noticeable trend is that @xmath37 monotonically decreases with position in all cases , as the pulse moves to regions where the focusing is weaker .",
    "this slowing in turn causes the curvature of the lines in figure  2 away from the line of maximum speed .",
    "another noticeable feature in figure  3a is the convergence of curves for different @xmath31 toward a universal curve for smaller @xmath37 values .",
    "this convergence occurs later for higher values of @xmath16 and always appears at similar values of @xmath37 , indicating that the convergence coincides with the decay of the coherent pulse toward a diffusive distribution .",
    "this can be verified by examining @xmath38 ( figure  3b ) .",
    "we note that the position at which @xmath39 ( long - dashed line ) for each @xmath16 corresponds roughly to the position of convergence , and to a value of @xmath40 .",
    "we will therefore refer to @xmath41 as the coherent pulse rgime and to @xmath42 as the diffusive rgime .",
    "the behavior of @xmath37 vs.  @xmath30 can be interpreted in terms of an equilibrium between the scattering and focusing terms in eq.([eq : tr ] ) with the streaming term `` turned off . ''",
    "[ the scattering / focusing eigenfunctions defined by earl ( 1976a ) used a different form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr ] ) , and thus have a different physical interpretation . ] figure  4 shows simulation results for the equilibrium average of the pitch - angle cosine , @xmath43 , and the equilibration distance , @xmath44 , which is the distance traveled over which equilibrium is achieved , or @xmath19 times the longest relaxation time .",
    "the results for @xmath43 are in good agreement with the analytic expression @xmath45 ( fortunately , for the @xmath31 values chosen here , these integrals can be solved in terms of simple functions ) . for large @xmath5",
    "( i.e. , @xmath46 , or the weak focusing limit ) , @xmath44 approaches a @xmath31-dependent value ( equal to or slightly larger than @xmath16 ) which agrees with the @xmath47 value of bieber ( 1978 ) .",
    "for very small values of @xmath5 , where there is very strong focusing , @xmath44 is also small , and the distribution achieves pitch - angle equilibrium very quickly . at the same time , @xmath48 , so the distribution `` relaxes '' rapidly ( within @xmath0 au ) to form a coherent pulse with nearly maximal anisotropy and highly collimated motion along the magnetic field ( figures 1 and 5 ; a finer grid spacing was used for these simulations ) . note that the spiky features in figure 1 , before pitch - angle equilibrium is reached , are due to the low scattering coefficient , @xmath14 , near @xmath33 .",
    "initial injections that were isotropic or highly focused yielded essentially the same distribution beyond @xmath49 au , with the former lagging by only 0.004 au . a reflecting boundary condition gave virtually identical results .",
    "farther from the sun , we see that @xmath43 rapidly declines with @xmath5 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "since the equilibration distance rapidly increases , the pitch - angle equilibrium is not maintained and @xmath37 declines less rapidly . for a narrow pulse",
    ", the deviation from pitch - angle equilibrium evolves according to @xmath50 however , this equation gives a steady - state deviation which is insufficient to account for the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath43 in the diffusive rgime .",
    "the remaining deviation can be explained by considering the width of the distribution . during the diffusive phase ,",
    "the average of @xmath43 over the distribution can deviate significantly from the value at @xmath30 .",
    "thus we see that the convergence of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath30 for different @xmath31 s in the diffusive phase is due to 1 ) the convergence of @xmath51 toward a @xmath31-independent function for @xmath52 , which can be shown to be @xmath53 , and 2 ) the similarity of @xmath54 as a function of @xmath30 for the three values of @xmath31 at each @xmath16 ( figure  3b ) .",
    "we note that the transport equation used here neglects several well - known effects . diffusion and drifts perpendicular to the field could reduce the intensity , especially for well - connected events , for which neighboring flux tubes have a lower intensity , but this should not significantly affect the propagation diagnostics discussed here .",
    "adiabatic deceleration and convection were included in numerical simulations by ruffolo ( 1995 ) and were shown to noticeably affect the propagation for ions of @xmath55 mev / n and electrons of @xmath56 kev .",
    "on the other hand , this approach does overcome the main limitation of the previous , analytic descriptions of coherent pulses ( earl 1976a , b ) , i.e. , the assumption of a constant focusing length ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we find that several of their conclusions do not apply for the case of a realistic archimedean spiral field .",
    "we find that for this case , the propagation speed is not constant , and does not exhibit distinct supercoherent and coherent rgimes , but rather decreases steadily along with @xmath43 .",
    "other results from our simulations show that the pulse width increases roughly linearly with time , in contrast with the result for an exponential field that @xmath58 ( earl 1974 ) . of course , these limitations do not diminish the importance of that seminal work .",
    "it is hoped that these results will be applicable to studies of the time profile of particle injection from solar flares , or comparisons of the time of injection for different particle species .",
    "when a strong coherent pulse is observed , one can estimate @xmath16 from the anisotropy and the pulse width ( figure 3 ) .",
    "a lack of consistency could indicate a finite injection width ( if the pulse width is high ) , or shock acceleration outside the corona ( if the anisotropy is high ) .",
    "one can derive the propagation time from @xmath16 , given an assumption or measurement for @xmath31 .",
    "subtracting the propagation time from the time of maximum then yields an estimated time of injection .",
    "note that conditions with @xmath59 au , corresponding to the highest mean free paths reported in the inner heliosphere , are sometimes called `` scatter - free '' conditions , with the implication that particles freely stream along the field at their maximum speed .",
    "however , our results show that even then , scattering significantly delays the arrival of the bulk of the pulse , while the `` onset '' is delayed somewhat less ( see also kallenrode and wibberenz , 1990 ) .",
    "in general , figure 2 can be used to derive an accurate estimate of the propagation time .",
