    "globular clusters are expected to provide ideal environments for the formation of close binaries , with their high stellar densities and much enhanced rates of star interaction .",
    "this is certainly the case for the x - ray bright interacting systems . almost from the advent of x - ray astronomy",
    "it has been known that the cluster population of luminous ( @xmath0 ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) is @xmath1100 times enhanced ( per unit stellar mass ) relative to the galaxy as a whole @xcite .",
    "another curious fact is that 11 of these 13 lmxbs must contain neutron stars rather than black holes , as they exhibit type - i x - ray bursts ( understood as thermonuclear runaway burning on the compact object s surface ) .",
    "moreover , the sensitive x - ray imaging of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has now revealed an equal number of probable quiescent systems in the few clusters examined to date @xcite , as well as the existence of _ two _ persistent lmxbs in m15 @xcite .",
    "the study of globular cluster lmxbs benefits greatly from a multi - wavelength approach .",
    "x - ray data , in general , only probe the vicinity of the central source , apart from the highest inclination systems where material farther out can cross the line of sight .",
    "the periods of four cluster lmxbs have been determined from eclipses by the donor star and/or from the periodic dips in their x - ray flux , understood as due to obscuration by vertically extended material near the edge of the accretion disc . however , with the identification of optical / uv counterparts ( in all but one case requiring the resolution of _ hst _ ) , we can immediately begin to estimate the linear scale of a system from the @xmath2 ratio , which has been shown to scale with disc area @xcite .",
    "photometric monitoring has also proven effective in revealing variability on the binary period , whilst the optical spectra can in principle provide definitive corroboration of a counterpart and further useful diagnostics .",
    "the x - ray burster x1746 - 370 , located in ngc6441 , is one of the x - ray `` dippers '' . from a continuous _ exosat",
    "_ observation , @xcite first observed dips and inferred an orbital periodicity , which was refined to 5.73@xmath3hr by @xcite using a more extensive _ ginga _ dataset .",
    "apart from a single deep ( 90% flux decrease ) dip , which showed spectral hardening @xcite , all the observed dips have been shallow ( @xmath415% ) and have shown no clear energy dependence .",
    "the apparently energy independent dipping is puzzling , implying that the obscuring material responsible for the electron scattering has metal abundance @xmath5 times solar , but this seems unlikely given the close to solar metallicity of the cluster as a whole @xcite .",
    "the alternative explanations are : photoionization of the material , a number of varying spectral components conspiring together , or an extended x - ray source ( i.e. an accretion disc corona ) .",
    "however , the most recent broad - band spectroscopy of @xcite using _ bepposax _ argues against any of these possibilities .",
    "one might contend that the standard dipping interpretation itself could be erroneous and it is certainly true that none of the x - ray period determinations has been sufficiently precise to confirm the recurrent period as orbital in origin based on its stability .",
    "additional progress has been made in the optical . using _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 imaging data , @xcite identified a variable , uv - excess star ( designated u1 ) in the _ einstein _ x - ray error circle .",
    "however , given the surprisingly large number of similar uv - bright stars in the cluster , there remained a possibility that u1 might be a chance superposition on the x - ray position .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ probability of this coincidence was calculated to be @xmath430% ( based upon a 3  radius 90% confidence _ einstein _",
    "error circle ) .    as part of a continuing program to probe the optical / uv counterparts to the luminous globular cluster x - ray sources",
    ", we have reexamined the optical position in the light of new _",
    "chandra _ x - ray imaging data , and also obtained time - resolved _",
    "optical spectra of the candidate counterpart to the burster x1746 - 370 .",
    "_ chandra _ observed the field of x1746 - 370 with a short exposure of 3.2ks on 2000 may 5 ; we obtained the dataset from the archive .",
    "the @xmath430@xmath630@xmath7 field - of - view high resolution camera imager ( hrc - i ; * ? ? ? * ) was approximately centered on the cluster center .",
    "data reduction was undertaken with routines in ciao .",
    "the observation was not affected by any periods of background flaring , hence applying the standard good time intervals and correcting for dead time , we obtained 2903s of data on source . owing to this shallow exposure",
    ", only three sources were detected at greater than 3@xmath8 above background in the entire field , using a mexican - hat wavelet source detection routine ( wavdetect ) . the brightest source ( 50000 counts )",
    "was clearly the main target , whilst the other two were very much fainter ( only 27 and 11 net counts ) _ and _ were located within 3  and 20  of chip edges respectively , where the psf is most extended and distorted . as a consequence , neither faint source could be reliably used to improve / confirm the nominal astrometry from the satellite s aspect solution , although probable optical identifications ( within @xmath41 ) to the bright ( non - cluster ) stars hd 161892 and gscii s2220122126 were made . for the reprocessed version of the dataset we used ,",
    "there are no known aspect offsets , hence we take the centroided position of x1746 - 370 given by wavdetect as the best x - ray position possible : @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 , @xmath13@xmath14@xmath11@xmath15 , where we quote our uncertainties as those of the _ chandra _ aspect @xcite .    we have estimated our sensitivity limits for other lower luminosity cluster sources . within the cluster half - mass radius of 38@xcite , but beyond the @xmath420  wings of x1746 - 370 , a source with @xmath16would be just detectable , yielding @xmath15 counts@xmath17 ( as determined from _ bepposax _ spectra , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and typical blackbody or thermal bremsstrahlung spectral models representing quiescent lmxb or cataclysmic variable star emission .",
    "] , comparable to the brightest quiescent lmxbs detected by _",
    "chandra _ in other clusters ( see  [ sect : intro ] ) .",
    "closer to the bright source the limits will naturally be higher due to the increase in effective background ; this includes the entirety of the cluster core region .",
    "although a precise optical position for the proposed counterpart to x1746 - 370 ( star u1 ) was published by @xcite , that astrometry was based on the _ hst guide star catalog _ reference frame @xcite .",
    "this predates the improvement made possible by _ hipparcos _ , and the construction of the international celestial reference system ( icrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the reference frame for the _ chandra _ astrometry .",
    "although the difference in a given position is typically @xmath18 , this is still significant when compared to the sub - arcsecond precision of the _ chandra _ x - ray position .",
    "hence we have redetermined the astrometry using the very accurate usno - a2.0 star catalog @xcite , which makes it possible to tie an arbitrary field rather easily to the icrs with sub - arcsecond precision .",
    "once again we make use of the ground - based ccd image of the ngc6441 field kindly provided by g. jacoby ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we select 46 bright , isolated stars in common between the usno - a2.0 catalog ( epoch 1982.0 in this field ) and the ground - based ccd image ( epoch 1995.6 ) and fit an astrometric solution to the image using idl procedures written by e.w.d . and from the _ astronomy user s library _ @xcite .",
    "the residuals of the fit ( @xmath8=@xmath19 ) imply an approximate uncertainty ( @xmath20 ) in the alignment to the usno - a2.0 frame of @xmath21 before considering proper motion effects .",
    "@xcite derived empirical uncertainties in the transfer of the usno a-2 frame ( via reference star matching ) to ground - based images comprising the second digitized sky survey ( dss - ii ) , which effectively includes the scatter induced by the differing epochs of the data and random proper motion effects .",
    "hence , we conservatively adopt the 1@xmath8 radial uncertainty of @xmath22 given in the last row of table 1 in @xcite .    the next step is to transfer this solution to the u - band ( f336w filter ) images from the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 ( epoch 1994.7 ) .",
    "these data are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the pc was centered approximately on the core , and hence the corresponding portion of the ground - based image is very severely crowded .",
    "it is therefore clearly advantageous to use the data from the wf chips outside of the cluster core and relate this to pc chip on which the candidate counterpart star u1 is located .",
    "this is made possible by the stsdas routine metric , which uses the well - calibrated relative positions of each of the chips and the geometrical distortions across the field of each to accurately give an ra and dec for any star on any chip , based upon the astrometric solution present in the wf2 image header .",
    "we therefore identified 52 well - isolated stars which appear on both the ground - based image and the 3 wf chips .",
    "given the icrs astrometry solution now written into the header of the ground - based image , we are able to obtain icrs positions for each of these stars and cross - compare to the nominal result given by metric for the wfpc2 astrometric solution .",
    "we find that shifts of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in ra and dec are adequate to bring the wfpc2 data onto the icrs , with no correction to the orientation necessary . again from the standard deviation of the residuals we estimate a radial uncertainty of @xmath25 for this step , negligible compared to the other uncertainties .",
    "with the corrections in place , we measure a new position for star u1 in the icrs of : @xmath26@xmath27@xmath11@xmath28 , @xmath13@xmath29@xmath11@xmath22 .",
    "this position differs appreciably ( @xmath30 ) from that quoted by @xcite , with essentially all the difference due to the different astrometric frames , and should supercede those earlier data .",
    "on 1999 june 28 , we obtained _ hst _ optical spectroscopy of star u1 .",
    "we used stis @xcite with a @xmath31@xmath3252  aperture which was well - centered on the target , following a blind offset from a nearby bright star .",
    "the g430l grating was employed , together with the stis - ccd detector , yielding a useful wavelength range of @xmath430005700  and spectral resolution @xmath33 .",
    "five _ hst _ orbits of data were taken , with five separate exposures during each , except for the first _",
    "_ orbit for which there are only four exposures .",
    "the standard pipeline reductions produce a variety of data products , where all the data taken in a given _ hst _ orbit have been combined together .",
    "this combining facilitates the removal of the numerous cosmic ray events , via one - sided sigma clipping ( together with a noise model for the detector ) .",
    "unfortunately , the ccd also suffers from a number of defects , which appear as anomalously high or low spikes in the extracted spectra .",
    "these we identified and later removed by hand from the spectra . taking the combined cosmic - ray rejected spectrum images from each _ hst _ orbit , we applied the stsdas x1d aperture extraction and calibration routine to produce 1-d flux and wavelength calibrated spectra for the target and a number of other reasonably isolated stars of similar brightness located on the long slit .",
    "for each star , we kept the width of the extraction regions the same for all images , but allowed the position to track any change in the trace position .",
    "we were careful in setting both the source and neighboring background regions to exclude as much as possible contributions from other cluster stars , but inevitably in this dense core region , many very faint stars will be unavoidable .",
    "examination of these spectra shows that : ( i ) u1 possesses a featureless continuum with no strong emission lines or notable absorption features ( apart from caii h+k from imperfect background subtraction ) at the modest signal - to - noise of these data ; ( ii ) in comparison to other stars the ( reddened ) continuum of u1 has almost constant flux density , making it the brightest star in the blue ( @xmath34 ) but one of the faintest in the red ; ( iii ) relative to the comparison stars the flux level of the continuum of u1 appears to vary significantly . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] we show the median stacked spectra ( total exposure time of 12680s ) of star u1 and a representative comparison star , and two individual spectra showing the variability of u1 between its highest and lowest flux levels . as this cluster",
    "is substantially reddened ( @xmath35 ) , the observed flat spectrum implies intrinsic colors that are very blue .    in order to compare the flux levels to the previous wfpc2 photometry",
    ", we have estimated the corresponding stmag magnitudes from our spectra : for f336w ( @xmath36 ) they range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and for f439w ( @xmath39 ) from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , with uncertainties based on systematic variations ( see below ) . comparing to table 1 of @xcite , the f336w magnitudes are consistent with the 1994 levels given the source s variability , but at f439w the source is @xmath40.3 mag brighter than in 1994 , i.e. it appears considerably redder .",
    "it is possible that there is spectral contamination present from a redder star ( e.g. the wings of a neighbor , centered just off the slit , @xmath22 away ) , but the lack of significant color - terms in the variability suggests not ( see fig.[fig : spec ] lower panel ) .",
    "moreover , we note that the 1995 wfpc2 data found the source with similar f439w brightness levels to our 1999 spectrophotometry , and since no f336w data were taken in 1995 , the source could have been similarly redder then . in order to further quantify the variability exhibited by u1",
    ", we have calculated the total net counts in the continua of u1 and several comparison stars for each _ hst _ orbit .",
    "we repeated the aperture extractions from the combined cosmic - ray rejected images , but this time without applying any further calibrations , yielding count rate versus pixel spectra .",
    "next we fitted the continuum shape of the source and background spectra with spline functions , and replaced points deviant by more than 4@xmath8 , by the appropriate continuum fit .",
    "lastly , we summed the counts in these cleaned 1-d spectra over all pixels . at this stage",
    "we also estimated the random errors in the net counts , based upon poisson counting statistics together with ccd read - noise contributions .",
    "these indicated that a high nominal accuracy can be obtained , and therefore that variations seen in the comparison stars ( which should of course exhibit constant fluxes ) must arise from systematic effects .    to examine these systematic effects",
    "further we considered higher time - resolution data . instead of combining all the exposures from a given _ hst _ orbit to remove cosmic rays , we used all available adjacent pairs ( i.e. calculating a running average ) giving 3 or 4 cleaned spectra per orbit .",
    "once again systematic trends were apparent .",
    "at least two statistically independent data points are available per orbit , so we use the scatter of the most divergent pair to conservatively estimate the uncertainty in the count rates we obtained from the fully combined data .",
    "the final lightcurves are plotted for u1 and the comparison stars in figure  [ fig : lc1 ] .",
    "systematic long - term trends in count rate are immediately apparent , but these are reasonably well fit ( i.e. @xmath42 ) by a linear function in every case apart from u1 , where @xmath43 . in the lower panel , we plot the data for u1 once more , and this time fit sinusoidal models to the data , one with a constant offset and another allowing for a linear trend , akin to that of the comparison stars . in each case",
    ", the period is constrained to that of the x - ray dips ( 5.73 hr ) , and we see that the observed optical modulation is indeed consistent with this periodic model .",
    "the fits are clearly much better than for the simple linear trend , with @xmath44 and 0.9 for the sinusoid , without and with a linear term respectively . applying an f - test to the two models indicates that the addition of the linear term to the sinusoid is only marginally preferred at the 66% confidence level .",
    "we find peak - peak amplitudes of 16% and 20% , in reasonable agreement with the short term @xmath430% changes seen previously in this star in the f336w photometry @xcite .",
    "while we certainly can not claim to have detected the x - ray period in the optical data , we feel our data do provide evidence for this effect .",
    "l l l l l l band & telescope & @xmath45 ( j2000 ) & error & @xmath46 ( j2000 ) & error + & & ( h , m , s ) & ( @xmath47)&(@xmath48 , , ) & ( @xmath47 ) + x - ray & _ chandra_/hrc - i & 17 50 12.73 & @xmath12 & -37 03 06.8 & @xmath15 + optical & _ hst_/wfpc2 & 17 50 12.728 & @xmath28 & -37 03 06.53 & @xmath22 +",
    "the new _ chandra _ x - ray and optical positions for x1746 - 370 and its proposed counterpart u1 are summarized in table  [ tab : posns ] , and illustrated in figure  [ fig : posns ] .",
    "the positional agreement is excellent and well - within the ( small ) estimated radial uncertainties , providing strong support for the optical identification .",
    "following the _ a posteriori _ probability estimate of @xcite , but with a new 90% confidence radius of @xmath49 for the _ chandra _ error circle , the area enclosed is 7 times smaller than for _ einstein _ , and hence only a @xmath44% probability remains that we have chance alignment of an unrelated uv - excess cluster star with the x - ray position .",
    "moreover , our new _ hst_/stis spectra confirm that star u1 is unusually blue . but",
    "more conclusively , the temporal coverage afforded by our time - resolved spectra are sufficient to confirm the optical variability of the source , which appears periodic and can be well fitted with a sinusoid constrained to the 5.73 hr x - ray period .",
    "the firm identification of the optical counterpart does have further implications for our view of the nature of the source , including the issue of the unusual energy independent x - ray dips .",
    "first , the most likely origin for the sinusoidal optical modulation on the x - ray period is the varying contribution from the bright x - ray heated face of the donor .",
    "hence , its possible detection would not only confirm the correct identification , but also support the standard picture that the recurring dips are related to periodic obscuration on the orbital period .",
    "second , as previously noted by @xcite , the faintness of the optical star implies that @xmath50 , typical of lmxbs in which we directly observe the central source , and therefore consistent with the detection of bursts from this source .",
    "in particular , this suggests that it is unlikely that the dips are primarily due to obscuration of an extended accretion disc corona ( adc ) ; in the classical adc sources where only scattered x - rays are visible , @xmath51 .",
    "our optical spectral data also argue against such an adc interpretation . considering all lmxbs with comparable periods ( and hence disc sizes ) ,",
    "most show characteristic emission lines in this spectral region at h@xmath52 , heii @xmath534686 and the bowen ciii / niii blend @xmath534640 ; moreover , all three known classical adc sources exhibit strong emission at one or more of these lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the lack of strong line emission in x1746 - 370 is unlike any of these adc systems , and is even unusual compared to the field lmxbs in general .",
    "however , we note that our _ hst _ spectra of the globular cluster lmxbs in ngc6624 , and 6712 @xcite are similar to x1746 - 370 in ngc6441 insofar as they are also very blue / uv , but largely featureless at modest signal - to - noise and resolution .    within the context of the diverse nature of the cluster lmxb population",
    ", x1746 - 370 might at first glance be considered a rather average system . in terms of period",
    "it lies midway between the three with ultra - short periods ( p@xmath54 1 hr ) in ngc6624 , 1851 and 6712 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the two long period systems in terzan 6 and m15 ( ac211 ) ( p=12.4 hr and 17.1 hr respectively ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is the longest period confirmed burster , since the terzan 6 lmxb has not been seen to burst , and we now know that ac211 ( m15-x1 ) is almost certainly an adc source and m15-x2 , a source without a known orbital period , is the probable burster there @xcite .",
    "the recent results on ngc6652 @xcite indicate that its burster is perhaps the most similar , with a longest possible period of 4.4 hr , though 0.92 hr also fits the available data .",
    "if this shorter period in ngc6652 does turn out to be correct , of the five bursters with determined or well - constrained periods , four would be double - degenerate ultra - compact systems and only x1746 - 370 would be similar to a typical galactic burster .",
    "@xcite have already commented on this prevalence of very exotic systems in globular clusters .",
    "it would appear that the unique formation / evolution processes at work in globular cluster cores ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review) e.g. the tidal capture and exchange encounter mechanisms and subsequent stellar interactions , leading to the hardening of already hard binaries  may have led to an enhancement of the ultra - compact lmxbs at the expense of the wider systems like x1746 - 370 . in any case , the ( growing ) population of lmxbs may serve as important tracers of the stellar dynamics and evolution within globular clusters .",
    "we once again thank george jacoby and collaborators for providing ground - based ccd images of ngc6441 .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
