    "the dwarf irregular galaxy ic 10 is the nearest starburst galaxy so that it plays an important role for understanding the formation and evolution of stars in the starburst galaxies .",
    "it is located at the low galactic latitude ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) where the foreground reddening is expected to be large .",
    "in addition , the internal reddening of ic 10 may vary spatially due to its strong star forming activity .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to determine reliably the reddening and distance of ic 10 , and published values for reddening and distance of ic 10 have a large range : @xmath13 to 2 and @xmath14 kpc to 3 mpc , respectively@xcite . during the last decade ,",
    "these rangeg were decreased but are still large : @xmath15 to 1.2 and @xmath14 kpc to 1 mpc ( see @xcite and table [ tbl - other ] in this study for details ) .    since @xcite found that ic 10 is an extra - galactic object , there were several studies to determine the distance to ic 10 . in the early days",
    "the distance to ic 10 was estimated to be from 1.3 mpc to 3 mpc , based on the size of the hii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite determined the upper limit of the distance to ic 10 to be 1.8 mpc ( @xmath16 ) using the planetary nebula as a standard candle . using the brightest red supergiants and blue supergiants , @xcite derived a distance modulus of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 mpc ) .",
    "@xcite used the wolf - rayet stars and the bluest stars to obtain a distance modulus of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 mpc ) . @xcite and @xcite used the cepheid variables to obtain distance moduli of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 mpc ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 mpc ) , respectively . @xcite used the cepheid variables and the @xmath25 band magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) stars to derive a distance of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 kpc ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 kpc ) , respectively .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to estimate the foreground / total reddening toward ic 10 and the distance to ic 10 with high accuracy using deep near infrared ( nir ) @xmath0 photometry obtained with the subaru telescope and also using the optical photometry of ic 10 in the literature .",

    " 4 estimates the foreground reddening toward ic 10 and the total reddening of ic 10 . in  5 , we derive a relation between metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath4 and the red giant branch ( rgb ) slope in the @xmath45 cmd , and we use it to estimate the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in ic 10 .",
    "then we determine the distance to ic 10 using the @xmath46 and @xmath47 band magnitudes of the trgb . in  6 , we compare our results to those in the previous studies .",

    "deep imaging observations were carried out on 2005 december 9 , with multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) , a wide - field imaging camera and spectrograph on the subaru telescope .",
    "moircs consists of two hawaii-2 hgcdte arrays and has a field of view of @xmath49 with a spatial resolution of @xmath50 .",
    "we observed a field centered at ic 10 ( r.a .",
    "[ j2000.0]@xmath51 , decl . [ j2000.0]@xmath52 ) with a dithering mode using the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath7 band filters .",
    "our observation log is given in table 1 .",
    "total exposure times are 900 s , 675 s , and 1215 s for the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath7 bands , respectively .",
    "seeing was excellent during the observations , 0.5 to 0.6 .",
    "pre - processing of the images was performed in the standard manner by subtracting dark and bias and by performing flat correction using iraf / xdimsum .",
    "we corrected the optical distortion of the images that is fit well by the third - order polynomial as a function of the distance from the optical center ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 on chip 1 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 on chip 2 ) , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are coordinates of the center in each chip .",
    "individual long exposure images were combined with xdimsum to make a single mosaic image and to remove the varying sky fluctuation in each band .",
    "figure [ fig - ic10region_dpi150 ] shows a gray scale map of the @xmath7 band image of ic 10 .",
    "we note that numerous resolved stars are visible throughout the field with a higher concentration of stars around the middle part of the field , and that little signature of dust feature is visible .",
    "we divided the entire observed field ( called ra ) into three subregions for the following analysis as shown in figure [ fig - ic10region_dpi150 ] : r2 for the central region , and r1 and r3 for the northern and southern outer regions , respectively .",
    "we listed the mean surface number density of the stars for each region in table [ tbl - region ] .",
    "the mean surface number density of stars in the r2 region is @xmath61arcsec@xmath62 , and that of the r1 and r3 regions is @xmath63arcsec@xmath62 .",
    "therefore , there are a factor of 1.8 times more stars per unit area in the central region compared to the outer regions .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of point sources in the images were derived from the combined images for each filter , using a custom software * @xmath64 * , which runs automatically a combination of daophot , allstar , montage2 , and allframe @xcite .",
    "we transformed the instrumental magnitudes onto standard magnitudes using @xmath0 photometry in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog for the objects that are common with those in our observation .",
    "we selected several dozens of bright stars in the 2mass point source catalog with good quality flags ( aaa ) , and matched these sources with those in our observation . due to the large difference in seeing fwhms between 2mass images(@xmath65 ) and the present subaru @xmath66 images ( @xmath67 ) we consider the matches with matching distance smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig - calib ] displays the difference between the 2mass magnitudes and the instrumental magnitudes for these stars .",
    "we used the data points inside the boxes in each panel for calibration .",
    "the mean values for the differences ( the 2mass magnitudes minus the instrumental magnitudes in this study ) are : @xmath69 mag ( 31 stars ) , @xmath70 mag ( 29 stars ) , @xmath71 mag ( 37 stars ) , for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "therefore the mean errors for calibration are 0.010 , 0.017 , and 0.012 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "it is known that the effect of color term is negligible between 2mass photometric system and the nir photometric system in mauna kea observatories @xcite so that we did not consider any color term for standard calibration .",
    "the final catalog of @xmath66 photometry of ic 10 includes @xmath72 stars .",
    "the magnitude limits are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 mag , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig - mag_err ] , we display mean photometric errors of the stars in the @xmath7 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 as a function of the @xmath7 magnitude .",
    "the photometric errors in figure 3 represent the mean of the photometric errors of daophot / allframe photometry at a given magnitude range .",
    "these errors were derived from the photometry of the combined images for each filter hence represent the photon noise .",
    "we also checked the errors due to frame - to - frame repeatability using the photometry of individual images , finding that they are similar to those derived from the combined images .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath32 photometry of bright stars in a central @xmath78 field of ic 10 .",
    "we compared our photometry with that of @xcite , displaying the magnitude differences between this study and @xcite in figure [ fig - comp_bori ] .",
    "the mean magnitude differences ( this study minus @xcite ) with @xmath79 clipping are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 mag for the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath7 bands , respectively . if we use only the bright stars with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 mag , these differences decrease significantly : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 mag for the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath7 bands , respectively .",
    "our magnitudes are slightly fainter than @xcite s .",
    "to understand the cause of this magnitude difference , we estimate the effect of source blending due to the difference in the spatial resolution .",
    "note that the data used for @xcite were obtained under the seeing of @xmath89 and the scale of the nir detector of @xmath90/pixel . to estimate the degree of brightening of a source due to the unresolved nearby faint point sources , we first compared the luminosity function of point sources in the region common between the two studies . for the bright point sources with @xmath91 mag , there are 219 point sources in @xcite , which is similar to the number of sources found in this study , 295 .",
    "for the fainter sources with @xmath92 mag , we found 295 point sources in @xcite , which is much smaller than the number of sources found in this study , 739 .",
    "this is consistent with the incompleteness results given in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the faint point sources with @xmath93 mag , which were completely or partially detected in this study , are merged into the nearby brighter stars with @xmath91 mag due to the poor spatial resolution . with this assumption and the seeing fwhm of @xcite , we computed the mean brightness of those sources and found that the mean brightness of brighter stars ( @xmath94 mag , and @xmath91 mag ) increases by @xmath95 and @xmath96 . with these correction values the magnitude differences between ours and @xcite decrease to small values of @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "therefore the magnitude differences between the two studies are mainly due to difference in the spatial resolution of the images .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 photometry of this study is significantly deeper ( @xmath99 2 mag ) than that of @xcite",
    ". therefore a large scatter at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath100 mag ) in figure 4 is mainly due to the large photometric errors in @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig - cmd_jkk_con_n3 ] , we display the @xmath101 cmd of the measured stars in the entire observed region and three subregions .",
    "the number density contour maps are overplotted to show clearly the morphology of the rgb .",
    "several features are noted in figure [ fig - cmd_jkk_con_n3 ] .",
    "first , the most distinguishable feature is an rgb population with @xmath102 , showing that most of the resolved stars are red giants with @xmath103 mag .",
    "second , there is an additional notable feature brighter than the brightest part of the rgb , which is an agb population .",
    "agb stars have @xmath47 magnitudes of 17 to 18 mag .",
    "third , there is a horizontal feature extended to the redder color from the brightest part of the agb , which are mostly carbon stars .",
    "fourth , there is an almost vertical bright sequence with @xmath104 , which are mostly foreground main - sequence ( ms ) stars belonging to the galaxy .",
    "we estimate both foreground and internal reddening of ic 10 using @xmath1 photometry from the local group survey given by @xcite and @xmath66 photometry in this study .",
    "we adopted the extinction laws for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "we estimate the foreground reddening toward ic 10 using @xmath1 photometry of the foreground stars in the direction of ic 10 .",
    "we use @xmath1 photometry of a @xmath109 field covering ic 10 given in the local group survey @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - plot_ic10_ext4paper1](a ) displays the optical @xmath110 cmd of these stars .",
    "the majority of point sources seen in the cmd are foreground stars . the blue plume fainter than @xmath111 mag in the cmd represents mainly the bright ms stars in ic 10 . to estimate the foreground reddening toward ic 10 , we selected bright foreground ms stars inside the large tilted box in figure [ fig - plot_ic10_ext4paper1](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig - plot_ic10_ext4paper1](b ) shows the @xmath112 diagram of these selected foreground ms stars .",
    "we adopted @xmath113 , and showed the reddening direction for one magnitude visual extinction by an arrow in figure [ fig - plot_ic10_ext4paper1](b ) .",
    "recently @xcite argued that there might be insignificant difference in the extinction law between the milky way , lmc , and smc .",
    "we binned the data in @xmath114 color with a magnitude bin size of @xmath115 and fitted these with the empirical fiducial relation for the ms @xcite using the chi - square minimization method .",
    "we obtained the best fit value of @xmath116 with @xmath117 confidence level .",
    "this value is @xmath118 times smaller than that in @xcite , @xmath119 .",
    "it is noted that the reddening values for the low galactic latitude in @xcite have a large uncertainty .    due to the large sky area of the local group survey @xcite and the low galactic latitude of ic 10 , there might be spatial variation of the foreground reddening . to investigate any variation of the foreground reddening , we divided the sample of the foreground ms stars in the local group survey into four groups with different galactocentric distance ( @xmath120 ) . using the same method applied to estimate the foreground reddening for the total sample",
    ", we obtained the values : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "this result shows that there is little spatial variation of the foreground reddening over the field in this study",
    ". therefore we adopt the foreground reddening derived using the total sample of @xcite as a foreground reddening toward ic 10 .    the value for the foreground reddening of ic 10 derived above would be a lower limit for the following reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath129 color distribution of the foreground ms stars used for the reddening estimate shows a large dispersion of @xmath130 , which is @xmath131 times larger than the mean photometric error .",
    "second , the foreground reddening was estimated by using the mean colors of ms stars rather than the colors of individual stars . this large dispersion in the color of stars could be generally caused by 1 ) different galactic stellar population with different metallicity toward ic 10 , 2 ) photometric errors of observation , or 3 ) differential reddening of individual stars in the direction of ic 10 .",
    "because we observed a field in the very low galactic latitude ( @xmath132 ) , we may see through the galactic thin disk in which the stellar population may be somewhat homogeneous , having similar metallicity and age .",
    "therefore , the effect of the stellar population for the large color dispersion may be negligible .",
    "the photometric uncertainty should not be a cause for the large color dispersion in ic 10 , because we considered only the bright stars with small photometric errors .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the large dispersion in the @xmath129 color of the foreground stars is mainly attributed to the differential reddening of stars toward ic 10 .",
    "using the relation between @xmath1 photometric system and mk spectral classification of @xcite and the derived foreground reddening , @xmath133 , we computed the @xmath134 band distance moduli of the foreground ms stars in the tilted box of figure 6(a ) .",
    "we found that  90% of foreground stars are within @xmath135 kpc from the sun with a median distance of @xmath136 kpc , consistent with the galactic longitude of ic 10 , @xmath137 .",
    "we also found that the faintest ( @xmath138 mag ) red ms stars are located at the similar distance to that of the brightest ( @xmath139 mag ) blue ms stars , while there is a significant spatial spread for stars with intermediate colors .",
    "the total reddening of ic 10 consists of the foreground reddening ( due to the interstellar dust in the milky way ) and the internal reddening ( due to the interstellar dust in ic 10 ) .",
    "we applied two different approaches to estimate the total reddening : 1 ) comparing the mean nir colors of rgb stars in ic 10 and those in the smc in the @xmath45 cmd , and 2 ) using the @xmath112 diagram of the early - type stars in ic 10 .",
    "since the mean nir color of the rgb stars in a galaxy is expected to be similar to that of another galaxy with a similar metallicity , we can use the mean nir color of the rgb stars to estimate the reddening of a galaxy .",
    "we selected the smc as a comparison with ic 10 , because the smc , a nearby dwarf irregular galaxy , is known to have a similar metallicity to that of ic 10 @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath66 photometry of the smc stars given by @xcite .",
    "their photometry is given in the 2mass system , and reaches @xmath140 mag deeper than the 2mass .",
    "we compared the mean nir colors of the rgb stars of ic 10 and the smc as follows , assuming that the difference in metallicity between two galaxies is small ( @xmath141 dex ) . because our @xmath66 photometry of ic 10 includes stars @xmath142 mag fainter than the trgb",
    ", we compared the mean colors of rgb stars with @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is an apparent magnitude of the trgb in the @xmath7 band .",
    "the trgb magnitude for ic 10 is @xmath145 mag as derived in  5 .",
    "we estimated the @xmath144 of the smc as follows . to take advantage of multi - band photometry , we select the candidate rgb and agb stars with negligible internal reddening in the smc using both optical and nir photometry of the smc . using the deep optical photometry of the smc given by @xcite , we selected rgb and agb stars in the outskirt of the smc where the internal reddening for the rgb stars is expected to be negligible @xcite .",
    "we matched the selected rgb and agb stars to those in the nir catalog of @xcite , obtaining an nir photometric list of rgb and agb stars in the outer region of the smc . with these rgb and agb candidates",
    ", we determine the magnitude of the trgb in the smc to be @xmath146 mag .",
    "this value is very similar to that given in @xcite , @xmath147 mag .",
    "however , this value is about 0.2 mag fainter than that given by @xcite , @xmath148 mag , who used the denis catalog towards the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "we derived the mean loci of rgb stars in ic 10 and smc with @xmath149 magnitude interval in the @xmath47 band , and estimated the mean and dispersion of the @xmath76 colors by fitting the color distributions of rgb stars with a gaussian function .",
    "figure [ fig - plot_ic10_ext4paper2 ] displays the @xmath101 cmd of ic 10 with the mean locus of rgb stars for ic 10 ( _ solid line _ ) and that for the smc ( _ filled circles _ ) .",
    "the rgb locus for the smc was shifted vertically so that the trgb of the smc matches that of ic 10 .",
    "then the rgb locus of the smc was shifted horizontally so that it matches that of ic 10 .",
    "we found an excellent agreement between two rgb loci .",
    "the difference in reddening between ic 10 and the smc thus derived is @xmath150(ic 10smc)@xmath151 mag , and @xmath152(ic 10smc)@xmath153 mag . here",
    "the error represents the mean error of the derived mean color .",
    "it is noted that the rgb slope of ic 10 is very similar to that of the smc , supporting the assumption employed in this analysis .",
    "adopting the foreground reddening of the smc of @xmath154 given in @xcite , we derive a value for the total reddening of the rgb stars in ic 10 , @xmath155 .      using the @xmath1 photometry of bright blue ms stars in ic 10 from the local group survey @xcite",
    ", we directly estimated the total reddening for ic 10 .",
    "we selected bright blue stars in ic 10 with the conditions : @xmath156 mag , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 .",
    "these stars were plotted as triangles in figure 6 .",
    "we obtained the reddening of individual stars comparing the empirical fiducial line of the ms @xcite and the selected bright blue stars in the @xmath112 diagram , as shown in figure 6(b ) .",
    "the mean value for the total reddening is measured to be @xmath159 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the total reddening of @xmath155 derived using nir colors of the rgb stars .",
    "taking an average of the two estimates , we derive a value of @xmath160 for the total reddening for ic 10 , which is used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "this result is similar to the values , @xmath30 given by @xcite and @xmath161 given by @xcite , but it is larger than other previous estimations based on various observations and methods ( see table [ tbl - other ] . ) . it is noted that @xcite derived a reddening value of @xmath162 for ic 10 , which is smaller than our estimation , although both studies used the same photometric catalog .",
    "@xcite suggested that the absolute magnitude of the trgb in the @xmath25-band is a primary distance indicator for resolved galaxies since it depends little on metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath163 dex ) and age ( @xmath164a few gyrs ) of old stellar populations .",
    "however , the absolute magnitudes of the trgb depend on metallicity much more in the @xmath0 bands than in the @xmath25 band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . therefore we need to know the metallicity of rgb stars when using the nir trgb magnitudes for the distance estimation .",
    "it is known that the rgb slope of old stellar populations in the cmd is sensitive to the metallicity , while insensitive to age , and that the rgb slope has a strong correlation with metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the rgb slope can be used to estimate metallicity of old stellar populations . since the slope of the rgb does not depend either on reddening or on distance",

    "we note that the basic parameters of galactic globular clusters such as positions and @xmath167 are based on the literature @xcite , unless otherwise noted .",
    "in addition , we selected stars having 2mass @xmath169 values of 1 , 2 , or 3 , which indicate the best quality detections , photometry , and astrometry . with these selection criteria , the number of stars in each globular cluster is @xmath170 depending on the apparent size of a globular cluster .",

    "the distance moduli for ic 10 derived for three subregions and three different bands agree well within the uncertainties .",
    "since the crowding in outer regions is lower than that in the central region and the uncertainty of reddening is the smallest in the @xmath7 band , we derive a distance modulus of ic 10 by averaging the distance moduli of r1 and r3 regions in the @xmath7 band : @xmath229 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath230 @xmath231 kpc .",
    "we note that the quoted error of the distance modulus consists of random and systematic uncertainties .",

    "the distance to ic 10 has been derived with various standard candles : the wolf - rayet stars and blue plume @xcite , cepheid variables @xcite ) , red supergiant stars @xcite , carbon stars @xcite , and the trgb stars @xcite .",
    "previous estimates for the distance modulus of ic 10 range from @xmath232 to @xmath233 ( see table [ tbl - other ] ) , and the value derived in this study , @xmath234 , is in the middle of the previous estimates .    since different standard candles suffer from different reddening , it is not simple to figure out what causes the difference in the estimated distances",
    ". therefore we focus on the distance estimates only based on the trgb to investigate what causes the difference in the estimated distances .",
    "it is noted that the distance estimates based on the trgb method also show a large dispersion : @xmath235 in @xcite , @xmath236 in @xcite , @xmath237 in @xcite , and @xmath238 in @xcite .",
    "all previous studies based on the trgb method assumed @xmath239 except for @xcite who adopted @xmath240 , while we adopted @xmath241 .",
    "we checked how much the difference in the assumed value of @xmath242 contributes to the distance modulus estimation .",
    "when @xmath243 and @xmath244 were assumed , the various assumption of @xmath245 results in the distance scatters of 0.08 and 0.2 mag at maximum for nir ( @xmath32 ) bands and optical ( @xmath246 ) bands , respectively .",
    "therefore , the different value of @xmath245 does not contribute much to the large scatter in distance moduli ( @xmath247 mag ) as seen in table 5 .",
    "@xcite determined the distance to ic 10 based on the trgb method using @xmath248 photometry of ic 10 obtained at the hale 5 m telescope .",
    "they derived @xmath249 , and obtained a distance modulus of @xmath250 ( @xmath251 kpc ) , adopting a reddening value of @xmath252 .",

    "recently @xcite estimated the distance to ic 10 by comparing the magnitude of the trgb in the @xmath25 band to those of the smc and two galactic globular clusters , 47 tuc , and @xmath44 cen . adopting a total reddening of ic 10 , @xmath263 , and a distance to the smc , @xmath264 , they obtained a trgb distance modulus of ic 10 of @xmath43 . if the same reddening of @xmath253 as in this study is used , we derive a value @xmath265 .",
    "if we take a longer distance scale for the smc of @xmath266 @xcite , then their distance modulus , @xmath267 , is very close to ours .",
    "we note that the reddening value of ic 10 derived by matching visually the blue sequence of ic 10 to that of blue stars in the smc cluster ngc 346 in figure 3 of @xcite might be a lower limit , because the reddened rgb sequence of ic 10 is still bluer than that of the smc stars .",
    "we estimated the reddening and distance of the sta burst galaxy ic 10 using the @xmath0 photometry obtained from the subaru / moircs and @xmath1 photometry of ic 10 given by the local group survey @xcite .",

    "2 .   we estimated the foreground reddening of ic 10 using the @xmath1 photometry of foreground ms stars provided by the local group survey @xcite , obtaining @xmath116 .",
    "we also derived a value for the total reddening ( including the internal reddening ) of @xmath268 , using the @xmath112 diagram of early - type stars in ic 10 , and using a comparison of the rgb loci of ic 10 and the smc in the @xmath269 cmd .",
    "3 .   we derived relations between the metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath4 and the slope of the rgb in the @xmath171 cmd in several magnitude steps for 20 galactic globular clusters , using the 2mass point source catalog . using these calibrations , we estimated the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in ic 10 to be [ fe / h]@xmath4 @xmath188 .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the trgb is estimated to be @xmath270 .",
