    "certain out - of - equilibrium soft materials , including foams @xcite , concentrated emulsions @xcite and fractal colloidal gels @xcite , exhibit slow relaxation processes that often resemble the glassy dynamics observed in disordered hard materials such as polymer melts and spin glasses . the properties of many of these disordered soft systems evolve slowly with time , a behaviour commonly termed ` aging ' .",
    "aqueous foams , for example , age due to coarsening and bubble rearrangement processes @xcite .",
    "polymer glasses @xcite , microgel solutions @xcite and aqueous clay suspensions @xcite are some more examples of aging systems . in spite of their apparent diversity ,",
    "these materials are all structurally disordered and out - of - equilibrium .",
    "the existence of certain universal features in the evolution of the mechanical responses of these systems indicates an underlying generic mechanism that is responsible for the observed behaviour . to this end , a number of theoretical and experimental studies of the evolution of aging systems  including calculations of magnetic suceptibilities in frustrated spin systems @xcite , dielectric measurements of memory in molecular glasses @xcite , and measurements of the dynamic correlation functions of colloidal gels @xcite  have noted commonality in the dynamics under study with seemingly disparate systems .",
    "in addition to being sources of challenging fundamental problems in their own right , soft materials can serve as excellent model systems in the understanding of hard condensed matter as they often display several dynamic and thermodynamic properties typically associated with the latter .",
    "for example , recent work on melting of colloidal crystals has elucidated the importance of pre - melting at grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "another example is the mode coupling theory ( mct ) .",
    "originally applied to hard sphere liquids , mct accounts for many features observed in the colloidal glass transition including the presence of a two - step relaxation in the dynamical correlation function @xcite .",
    "based on this success , researchers have sought to extend application of the theory to the glass transition in molecular glasses and polymers @xcite . owing to their larger sizes and slower relaxation times",
    "when compared to , say , atomic fluids , the structure , dynamics and mechanical response of soft materials can be studied experimentally by common laboratory techniques such as microscopy , light scattering and rheology .",
    "the interaction between the individual constituents of soft materials can be tuned easily @xcite and this feature is exploited for example in the verification of the predictions of the mct for repulsive and attractive colloidal glasses @xcite . for a more complete discussion",

    "the presence of a glassy response , which is characterized by very slow , history - dependent dynamics , implies a loss of ergodicity .",
    "the transition of colloidal suspensions and granular media from an ergodic to a nonergodic state can be understood in terms of the jamming of overcrowded particles , which results in kinetic arrest and ultra - slow relaxation processes @xcite .",
    "for dense materials such as glasses , sandpiles and foams , liu and nagel @xcite suggest a jamming phase diagram that considers the possibility of unjamming the system ( _ i.e _ driving it towards ergodicity ) by increasing its temperature , by applying appropriately large shear stresses , or by decreasing the density of its constituents .",
    "universal non - diffusive slow dynamics and aging have been observed in a variety of jammed soft materials , for example , in colloidal suspensions @xcite , concentrated emulsions @xcite , micellar polycrystals @xcite and lamellar gels @xcite .",
    "glassy dynamics also occur in biologically relevant systems .",
    "examples include the kinetic arrest and scale - free rheology observed in the cytoskeleton of a living cell @xcite and the ultraslow relaxation processes in models of the adaptive immune response system @xcite .    in the specific case of disordered soft materials that can flow in response to macroscopic strains , metastability can result in anomalous rheology that is understood in terms of the soft glassy rheology ( sgr ) theory proposed by sollich _",
    "_ @xcite . for those systems",
    "whose thermal energy is not sufficient to achieve complete structural relaxation , sgr predicts identical power law frequency dependences of the low - frequency elastic and viscous moduli and identifies the exponent of this power law with a mean field noise temperature .",
    "the model predicts a glass transition , with the glass phase being characterised by the aging of the viscoelastic moduli and the presence of yield stresses .",
    "many of these features have been observed experimentally in concentrated microgel solutions @xcite , foams @xcite , paint @xcite , compressed emulsions @xcite , a thermotropic liquid crystal with quenched disorder @xcite and in the cytoskeleton of living cells @xcite .    in the remainder of this article , we discuss some theoretical models that describe the slow dynamics , aging and glassy rheology in soft materials and cite experimental results that verify the predictions of these models . in doing so",
    ", we have organised the paper in the following manner : section 2 contains an overview of the jamming phase diagram proposed by liu and nagel @xcite followed by a brief description of theoretical attempts to explain the non - diffusive slow dynamics and aging in soft materials in the jammed state .",
    "we next focus on the sgr theory @xcite that quantifies the flow and deformation behaviour of soft glassy materials ( sgms ) .",
    "section 3 reviews experimental work on the slow dynamics and aging in soft and living matter , followed by observations of anomalous rheology in many of these systems , with some emphasis on our recent work on the aging behaviour in synthetic colloidal laponite clay suspensions @xcite and the observation of soft glassy rheology in a thermotropic smectic liquid crystal confined within the pores of a compliant colloidal gel @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a brief summary and concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we present brief overviews of some models that are particularly relevant in the description of the slow dynamics , aging and glassy rheology in soft and living matter . these include the jamming picture , the prediction of ultraslow non - diffusive relaxation processes in aging soft matter and the sgr model .",
    "experiments that verify the predictions of these theories are summed up in section 3 .",
    "an approach to understanding the ergodic - nonergodic transition is provided by the concept of jamming @xcite .",
    "jamming of overcrowded particles results in kinetic arrest and signals a fluid - solid transition .",
    "the jamming phase diagram provides a unified picture for the ergodic - nonergodic transition in systems as diverse as molecular glasses , foams , granular matter and colloidal suspensions @xcite . if a system arrests as soon as it is able to support an external load , such that it responds elastically to some compatible loads while undergoing plastic rearrangments under incompatible loads , it is classified as fragile @xcite .",
    "jamming of fragile matter leads to slow dynamics because of the kinetic constraints it imposes on the motion of the individual constituents .",
    "_ draw a distinction between fragile materials and conventional solids by noting that in the case of the former , applied stresses are supported by force chains that can collapse under the action of an incompatible load @xcite .",
    "this can lead to unjamming .",
    "the jamming picture has been subsequently expanded by liu and nagel @xcite to include jammed systems such as foams and granular matter which are characterised by yield stresses and are therefore not fragile according to the definition of cates _ et al .",
    "in addition to fluidising a system by the application of shear stresses as suggested in @xcite , the authors in @xcite suggest the possibility of unjamming a jammed system by increasing its temperature ( in the case of , say , molecular glasses ) or by decreasing the density of its constituents ( in the case of , say , aqueous foams ) . in this way",
    ", they suggest a natural connection between the glass transition in supercooled liquids and the fluid - solid transition in athermal systems such as foams and granular matter . to encompass these ingredients ,",
    "the authors introduce a phase diagram ( fig .",

    "ultra - slow dynamics and aging observed in colloidal gels @xcite , clay suspensions @xcite , compressed emulsions @xcite and multilamellar vesicles @xcite are understood in terms of the relaxation of internal stresses that are built into the sample at the jamming transition . the dynamical structure factors ( dsfs ) characterising these systems are strongly dependent on sample age ( quantified in terms of the waiting time @xmath4 since sample preparation or the onset of jamming ) and exhibit non - diffusive , faster - than - exponential forms .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath5 characterising these slow dynamics scales with wave vector @xmath6 as @xmath7 . in the case of a fractal colloidal gel which undergoes syneresis ( microcollapses in its structure ) @xcite , the relaxation process that gives rise to the observed decay of the dsf",

    "these trends imply ballistic strain in the sample characterised by a velocity distribution function @xmath10 in response to the stress @xcite .",
    "allowing for a finite collapse time @xmath11 for each microcollapse event and writing a central force elasticity equation for the strain field around a force dipole , bouchaud and pitard @xcite calculated several regimes for the dsf , with the compressed exponential behaviour @xmath12 $ ] occuring only at earlier times . with a coupling between",
    "stress dipoles incorporated into the model , the growth of @xmath13 with @xmath14 is also computed , giving a @xmath15 dependence in this early time regime .",
    "the compressed exponential form of the dsf and the inverse linear dependence of the relaxation time on the wave vector are seen in experiments in a wide variety of soft materials .",
    "a sublinear dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath4 is also often observed , though the exponent of the power law can deviate significantly from the theoretical prediction in @xcite .",

    "two - step relaxation processes , such as those observed in supercooled liquids @xcite , dense colloidal suspensions @xcite and concentrated emulsions @xcite , can be understood in terms of the trap model .",
    "this model describes the glassy dynamics of a particle ( or an ` element ' ) trapped in a cage , _",
    "i.e. _ in a potential well created by the constraints imposed by neighbouring particles , such that escape from a cage is possible only by some activated process ( for example , by thermal activation in the case of supercooled liquids ) .",
    "these potential energy minima represent metastable states that are surrounded by high energy barriers whose heights , in the case of supercooled liquids , increase with decreasing temperature . at short times , the particles diffuse in their cages while at longer times they escape through activation .",
    "the separation of time scales for these processes leads to a two - step relaxation . in the glassy state ,",
    "the escape process becomes inaccessibly slow leading to nonergodic , partial relaxation and kinetic arrest . in polyelectrolyte",
    "microgel pastes , for example , individual microgel beads are trapped in cages formed by the neighboring particles .",
    "the intensity autocorrelation functions measured for suspensions of these particles , which can execute sub - diffusive motion in their cages at short times and are trapped ( kinetically arrested ) at long times , display an incomplete decay @xcite .",
    "bouchaud used the trap model to understand the relation between aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin glasses @xcite , where an effective particle is trapped in a one - dimensional potential energy landscape , and which , when activated , can hop into another trap .",

    "the ` glassiness ' of these materials is a consequence of their structural disorder and metastability , while their ` softness ' arises from their ability to flow upon the application of macroscopic strains .",
    "sgr @xcite uses a generalised trap model to describe sgms , such that each individual element , which moves in a one - dimensional piecewise quadratic potential ( fig .",

    "x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy ( xpcs ) uses synchrotron radiation to probe very high values of @xmath6 that are inaccessible by pcs methods involving visible light @xcite . for example , xpcs has been employed in @xcite to study the particle scale dynamics in an aging clay suspension , where each particle is a disc approximately 15 @xmath51 in radius and 1 @xmath51 in thickness .",
    "the dynamics of multiply scattering samples can be accessed with diffusing wave spectroscopy ( dws ) @xcite .",
    "multispeckle dws measurements of probe particles diffusing in aging clay suspensions are used to characterise the aging behaviour of the medium and have been reported in @xcite .",
    "conventional pcs experiments use a point detector and therefore require considerable time - averaging of the intensity autocorrelation function to ensure reasonable statistics . in order to reduce total experimental time ,",
    "multi - element detectors , such as charge - coupled device ( ccd ) cameras , are used to autocorrelate intensities at every camera pixel . for isotropic , nonergodic materials in which a time average and ensemble average are not equivalent",

    "multispeckle spectroscopy has proved to be an excellent tool to probe materials with slow and spatially heterogeneous dynamics @xcite .",
    "in contrast to pcs which measures microscopic properties , rheological experiments quantify the bulk flow and deformation behaviour of materials .",
    "bulk rheology involves the measurements of the viscoelastic moduli and the nonlinear flow properties of materials @xcite .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the applied strain , rheological measurements are classified as linear and nonlinear .",
    "linear rheology measurements cause no appreciable change in the microstructure of the sheared sample , and for a system in equilibrium , the resulting linear response functions can be related to dynamic correlation functions for the system through fluctuation - dissipation relations . for linear measurements involving the application of an oscillatory strain with an angular frequency @xmath52 and a suitably low amplitude @xmath53 , measurements provide the resultant stress amplitude @xmath54 and the angle @xmath55 by which the measured stress is phase - shifted with respect to the applied strain .",

    "the onset of jamming in these experiments is identified with the appearance of a low - frequency plateau of the elastic modulus that signifies the formation of an interconnected solid network @xcite that is reminiscent of the stress - supporting force chains suggested in @xcite .",
    "owing to the attractive interparticle interactions that restrict the mobility of the individual constituents , jamming is found to set in at smaller values of the particle volume fraction @xmath0 than in the case of hard spheres .",
    "the jamming - unjamming transition in this system is therefore strongly dependent on the interparticle interaction strength @xmath1 .",
    "like in the case of hard spheres , jammed attractive particles can also be unjammed by the application of stresses or by decreasing @xmath0 .",

    "the dashed line in the figure has slope 1.0 , indicating @xmath89 , clearly distinct from the xpcs results for initially formed laponite , @xmath94 , shown in fig .",
    "3b @xcite .",
    "we attribute this contrasting aging behaviour to differing origins of local stress in each case .",
    "as described in @xcite , sites of developing stress in the initially formed suspensions are identified with a growing interparticle repulsion due to charge dissociation . in the rejuvenation ,",
    "on the other hand , we identify them with residual local stress that is loaded into the sample by the strong shear flow and that is relieved by slow particle rearrangments . this more heterogeneous stress distribution , while leading to the same distribution of strain velocities and hence to the same form of @xmath44 , evidently evolves differently in time , creating distinct aging behavior .",
    "we note , however , that these new xpcs results on laponite rejuvenation suggest a need to re - evaluate the role of growing interparticle repulsions in the formation of soft solid laponite suspensions .",
    "as described in @xcite , a key piece of evidence for such growth was a steady increase with age of the short - time plateau value of @xmath93 and the increasingly constrained caged particle motion inferred from this increase . as fig .",
    "4a illustrates , laponite suspensions following rejuvenation unexpectedly display a very similar increase in the plateau value despite the fact that the interparticle interactions are likely unaffected by the rejuvenation .",
    "one possibility for this increase in the rejuvenated laponite suspensions is a slow strengthening of force networks in the suspensions weakened by the shear flow and a concomitant decrease in thermal fluctuations of these networks that create a fast partial decay in @xmath93 in analogy with the picture developed in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the increase in the plateau value during formation and after rejuvenation could have different origins .",
    "however , the strong similarity of the two behaviors suggests otherwise , calling into question the interpretation introduced in @xcite .",
    "further study of laponite rejuvenation with xpcs would be helpful in resolving this issue . nevertheless , the contrast between figs .",
    "3b and 4b illustrates clearly how the aging behavior of the slow , non - diffusive dynamics is sensitive to the precise source of the local stress .",
    "glassy rheology is a common feature in soft materials characterised by metastability and disorder .",
    "a signature feature of soft glassy rheology is the weak power law behaviours of the viscoelastic moduli .",
    "experimental systems that verify the power law behaviour of soft glassy materials include concentrated microgel solutions @xcite , foams @xcite , paint @xcite and compressed emulsions @xcite , all of which have @xmath56s that show a weak power law frequency dependence , with the exponent ( @xmath19 - 1 ) of the power law lying in the range 0.1 - 0.3 .",
    "that is , the noise temperature @xmath19 within the sgr model lies in the range 1.1 - 1.3 . in the case of the compressed emulsions @xcite , @xmath56 is always significantly greater than @xmath57 above the random close packing fraction ( @xmath95 @xmath96 0.635 ) of the droplets .",
    "as the droplet volume fraction @xmath0 is increased beyond @xmath95 , the droplets squeeze against each other and deform , and the resulting constraints on the droplet dynamics manifest as an increasingly flat elastic response .",
    "the elastic moduli of hard sphere colloidal suspensions , over a limited range of frequencies , also show power law frequency dependences characterised by exponents that decrease monotonically as the colloidal volume fraction @xmath0 increases toward the kinetic glass transition @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "these results are understood in terms of the kinetic arrest of particles trapped in their cages as the kinetic glass transition is approached .",
    "this decrease in the power law exponent towards @xmath98 indicates an approach towards the glass transition of the sgr model and thus directly connects that transition , at least qualitatively , to the kinetic glass transition in hard sphere colloids .",
    "further , for volume fractions above @xmath99 , colloidal suspensions display aging  @xcite .",
    "creep experiments on onion phases ( 20% aot in a 15 g / l brine solution ) also uncover very slow relaxation processes @xcite . the frequency dependent moduli , which track one another over more than three decades of angular frequency , show two distinct regimes : a low - frequency power law regime with an exponent close to zero that describes the slow relaxation of grain boundaries and long length - scale reorganisation processes , and a high - frequency regime which is dominated by the response of individual onions .",
    "the first part of the response is strongly reminiscent of sgr .",
    "the elastic and viscous moduli of suspensions of aging laponite , after showing maxwellian behaviour at the earliest times , eventually exhibit power law frequency dependences , with the exponent of the power law becoming smaller as the sample ages @xcite .",
    "this observation of aging in laponite when exponent @xmath100 at first glance seems at odds with the sgr picture , since @xmath101 constitutes the ergodic regime in the model .",
    "however , as mentioned above , studies of laponite indicate that the aging is driven at least partially by an evolving interparticle potential  @xcite , a feature that clearly lies outside the range of the model .",
    "another system exhibiting signature features of soft glassy rheology is the thermotropic smectic liquid crystal octylcyanobiphenyl ( 8cb ) confined within the pores of a highly porous and compliant hydrophilic aerosil gel ( size of individual aerosil particles is 7 nm )  @xcite . in this system",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 show power law frequency dependencies that arise from an interplay of the smectic order and the quenched disorder introduced by the gel .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "5a displays @xmath104 at 21@xmath105c ( red circles ) , several degrees below the nematic to smectic transition , and at 36@xmath105c ( blue squares ) , above the transition . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath102 is dominated by the colloidal gel .",
    "the greatly enhanced modulus in the smectic phase at lower temperature includes a weak power law component whose exponent @xmath27 decreases with increasing aerosil density @xmath106 , as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "this decrease thus signals an approach to the glass transition of the sgr model , @xmath107 ,  @xcite with increasing quenched disorder ( quantified by @xmath106 ) .",
    "the key role of the smectic order in this rheology is illustrated by contrasting this behavior with the rheology of the simple organic liquid dibutyl phthalate confined to the pores of an aerosil gel , shown in fig 5b .",
    "@xmath104 measured at 21@xmath105c ( red circles ) and 36@xmath105c ( blue crosses ) are essentially identical and show no frequency dependence as expected for the rheology of a colloidal gel in a low viscosity solvent . scaling behavior of the smectic modulus for the 8cb+aerosil indicates that the enhanced elasticity and glassy rheology result from a dense network of screw dislocations that arise due to the quenched disorder and whose motion is pinned by the disorder  @xcite .",
    "an excellent overlap of the data for different disorder strengths is observed when the ratio @xmath108 is plotted _ vs. _ temperature below the pseudocritical region @xcite .",
    "these observations point to a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath109 and @xmath19 , where @xmath19 quantifies the noise temperature influencing the dynamics .",
    "rheology data for the elastic moduli @xmath56 of 8cb dispersed in a porous aerosil gel of density @xmath109 = 0.10 g/@xmath110 is shown in a ) .",
    "the red circles correspond to g@xmath111 measured in the smectic phase ( t = 21@xmath105c ) which shows a power law contribution characterised by an exponent @xmath27 .",
    "the solid line through the data at 21@xmath105c is the result of a fit to a weak power law component plus a frequency - independent component as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the viscous modulus @xmath57 in the smectic phase also shows an identical power law dependence when the contribution of the gel is subtracted from the response ( not shown in this figure ) .",
    "the blue squares correspond to the approximately frequency independent behaviour when 8cb is in the nematic phase ( t = 36@xmath105c ) .",
    "the plot of @xmath27 _ vs. _ @xmath109 is shown in the inset .",
    "the errors bars are computed from the temperature variation of @xmath27 at each @xmath109 .",
    "this data is dapted from @xcite .",
    "part b ) shows the frequency response of a simple organic liquid dibutyl phthalate confined to the pores of an aerosil gel ( @xmath112 0.09 g/@xmath113 ) .",
    "the @xmath56 measured at 21@xmath105c ( red circles ) and 36@xmath105c ( blue crosses ) are both frequency independent , while their magnitudes are almost identical to the g@xmath111 measured for the 8cb - aerosil mixture ( with @xmath112 0.10 gm/@xmath110 ) when 8cb is in the nematic or isotropic phase . ]",
    "microrheological measurements in living cells show power law frequency dependences of the viscoelastic moduli of the cytoskeleton , where the effective noise temperature lies in the range @xmath114 and is found to depend strongly on the nature of the biological intervention employed in the experiment ( such as the addition of a contractile histamine ) @xcite .",
    "those biological processes that cause contractile acivity in the cell or result in the polymerisation of the cell proteins can drive the system towards a glass transition .",
    "disorder and metastability , therefore , contribute significantly to the mechanical functions of the living cell , with the noise temperature @xmath19 serving as a useful measure of its deformation and flow behaviour .",
    "similar glassy behaviour is also observed in the rat airway smooth muscle during actin modulation @xcite .",
    "the scale - free soft glassy rheology of living cells has been a subject of recent research @xcite .    under continuous shear flow , the potential energy landscape of soft glassy materials",
    "gets modified , such that the depths of the minima decrease temporally according to the relation @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the elastic constant relating the stress to the deformation and @xmath62 is the macroscopic strain rate .",
    "many sgms , such as concentrated emulsions @xcite and foams @xcite show herschel - bulkley type flow curves ( discussed in section 2.2 ) with a well - defined yield stress @xmath30 . for stresses of magnitude @xmath117 , the flow curve assumes a power law form with a power ( @xmath19 - 1 ) of around 0.1 .",
    "another example is a microgel paste made of jammed polyelectrolyte particles that can flow when sheared above a certain yield stress value .",
    "the glassiness of this material is evident from its herschel - bulkley flow curve @xcite .",
    "the synthetic clay laponite @xcite also shows a power law flow curve with noise temperature @xmath19 = 1.20 , a value slightly inconsistent with the values of @xmath19 obtained from the frequency - dependent measurements of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this discrepancy leads the authors to conclude that the nonlinear flow behaviour of colloidal laponite is significantly more complex than the predictions of the sgr theory @xcite .",
    "there is , therefore , a need for more experimental studies to verify the predictions of the sgr theory for the nonlinear response of sgms .",
    "in this paper , we have reviewed theoretical models used extensively to understand the slow dynamics of soft and living matter , focussing in particular on two key concepts : jamming and soft glassy rheology .",
    "the main purpose of the paper has been to provide a overview of these concepts and to catalogue some of the extensive experimental studies on a diverse range of soft and glassy materials that relate to these models .",
    "these concepts continue to undergo theoretical development , as exemplified by the recent work relating the zero - temperature jamming transition to k - core percolation @xcite and the introduction of tensorial constitutive models that generalise sgr @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the emergence of techniques such as multispeckle correlation spectroscopy and the availability of high - precision commercial rheometers have greatly facilitated the study of soft glassy materials .",
    "simultaneous rheometry and pcs studies that can correlate the bulk flow behaviour of these materials to their microscopic structure and dynamics are a potentially fruitful avenue for future experimental work . such continued innovation in experimental methods",
    "should lead to a better understanding of the aging , slow relaxational behavior , and glassy rheology observed in soft and living systems .",
