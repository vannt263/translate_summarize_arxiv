    "the existence of an _ anomalous _ magnetic moment @xmath9 is thus an indirect probe of the existence and properties of all degrees of freedom , within , but also beyond , the standard model .",
    "it actually turns out that , on the experimental level , the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron ( @xmath10 ) and of the muon ( @xmath0 ) are among the most precisely measured low - energy observables in particle physics . in the case of the muon , the very precisely known experimental value @xcite @xmath11 , \\ ] ] is dominated by the results obtained by the bnl - e821 experiment @xcite .",

    "the question naturally arises , whether theoretical evaluations are able to reach the same level of accuracy , and whether the standard model accounts for these values .",
    "most exciting , of course , is the possibility that eventually a significant discrepancy ( with reliable theoretical and experimental uncertainties ) remains , thus signaling the existence of degrees of freedom beyond the standard model .",
    "this review summarizes the present status of the theoretical evaluations of @xmath0 and of @xmath10 . in order to reach an accuracy comparable to the experimental results ,",
    "it is necessary to consider contributions from electromagnetic interactions ( section 2 ) , from weak interactions ( section 3 ) , and from strong interactions ( section 4 ) .",
    "the latter , although larger than the corrections from the standard model weak interactions , are particularly challenging , since they heavily involve the non - perturbative regime .",
    "this is why they have been kept for the end .",

    ", the experimenal uncertainty @xmath17 , together with @xmath18 , indicates that one needs to compute at least five loop contributions .",

    "they have been computed through systematic numerical evaluations of the multidimensional integrals over the corresponding feynman parameters .",

    "* i ) *  the accuracy of the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are known analytically , is actually limited by the uncertainties on the experimental values @xcite of the mass ratios @xmath22 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the electron case , these uncertainties would only affect the digits beyond those shown , and are not relevant given the present size of @xmath25 .",
    "the uncertainties on the four and five - loop coefficients come , in both cases , from the numerical integration procedure . +",
    "* ii ) *  in the muon case , the experimental accuracy is somewhat lower , @xmath26 , and one might think that even the fourth order is not needed . but",
    "this is without reckoning with the structure of the coefficients , which , in the muon case , are logarithmically enhanced by the presence of the much lighter electron in the loops .",
    "starting at three loops , one encounters terms involving @xmath27 ! this explains why the coefficients @xmath28 in table [ table_1 ] are typically larger than in the electron case . despite the size of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , so that this contribution remains marginal in view of the present experimental error .",
    "but it will also have to be considered as the latter improves ( see section 5 ) . + * iii ) *  some subsets of diagrams contributing to @xmath31 and @xmath32 are also known analytically @xcite , in terms of expansions in powers of the mass ratios .",

    "there is an additional error from the uncertainties on the mass ratios .",
    "it then follows that @xmath43 in the case of the electron , @xmath10 is well described by qed , within the uncertainties , which are dominated by the present uncertainty on the determination of @xmath42 . in the case of the muon ,",
    "the discrepancy with the experimental value is substantial , so that the difference is to be ascribed to the contributions of the weak and of the strong interactions .",
    "+ notice that one can use the measurement of @xmath10 in order to reduce ( by a factor 2.5 ) the error on @xmath42 and obtain a determination of the fine - structure constant at the @xmath44ppb level @xcite .",
    "but this means that @xmath10 then no longer provides a possible test of the standard model ( more on this at the end of section 5 ) .",
    "the one - loop contributions due to the weak interaction sector of the standard model have been computed @xcite more than forty years ago .",
    "they read @xmath45 , \\ ] ] and correspond numerically to @xmath46 .",
    "two - loop electroweak corrections are also available @xcite , and reduce the above value by about 20% . a recent reevaluation @xcite gives , for the sum of the one- and two - loop weak contributions ,",
    "@xmath47    after taking these contributions into account , we now have @xmath48 and only the strong interactions remain in order to close this gap .",
    "the strong - interaction contributions mainly come from the low - energy , light - quark , sector , so that a perturbative approach is no longer adapted .",
    "it is both useful and customary to distinguish three types of corrections involving the hadronic sector , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . the diagram on the left corresponds to hadronic contributions to the photon vacuum polarization function .",
    "the diagram in the middle is the so - called hadronic light - by - light contribution .",
    "finally , there is also a hadronic contribution to the two - loop weak corrections discussed in the previous section , arising from the exchange of a virtual photon and a virtual neutral weak gauge boson between the external lepton line and the hadronic blob ( right diagram ) . in comparison to the other two - loop weak corrections ,",
    "this last correction is small .",
    "it was already included in the values given in the preceding section , and will not be discussed further here . for details ,",
    "i refer the reader to the literature quoted in the preceding section .",
    "let us start by examining the case of hadronic vacuum polarization .",
    "this contribution can be expressed as @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 represents the @xmath52-ratio of the cross section of @xmath53 .",
    "the advantage of this representation is threefold .",

    "second , that it is dominated by the low - energy domain , since @xmath55 for @xmath56 large . and",
    "finally , it is directly related to an experimental quantity , which allows @xmath57 to be evaluated using available data on @xmath53 .",
    "the results from the two latest published evaluations @xcite give comparable values , @xmath58 , \\nonumber\\\\ a_{\\mu}^{\\rm hvp - lo } & = & + 694.9(4.3 ) \\cdot 10^{-10 } \\quad [ 30 ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding value for the electron reads @xcite @xmath59 and is larger than the present uncertainty on @xmath60 .",
    "there are also contributions of the same type at order @xmath61 , obtained upon inserting a second ( hadronic or leptonic ) vacuum polarization in one of the two virtual photons of the leftmost diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , or upon inserting a hadronic vacuum polarization in one of the photon lines of the two - loop qed contributions .",
    "these contributions can be written in a similar form as in eq .",
    "( [ hvp - lo ] ) , but involve now a ( known ) kernel different from @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "these next - to - leading hadronic vacuum polarization corrections , evaluated with the same @xmath53 data , amount to @xcite @xmath63 for the muon , and @xcite @xmath64 for the electron .",
    "recently , the next - next - to - leading hadronic vacuum polarization corrections were also evaluated @xcite , with the result @xmath65 summing these three contributions gives @xmath66 with the input from @xcite , or @xmath67 with the input from @xcite , and the difference @xmath68 equals @xmath69 or @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "we have kept for the end the hadronic contribution to virtual light - by - light scattering , that remains the most challenging one at present . here , we have no direct link to an experimental observable , and even the overall sign can not be fixed from the outset .",
    "one has to resort to a certain amount of model dependence in order to describe , in the non - perturbative regime , the hadronic four - point function ( see fig . [ fig-1 ] ) that is involved .",
    "only two calculations have tried to give a complete description of this four - point function from the point of view of its contribution to @xmath0 . after correcting for the sign @xcite of the dominant contribution coming from the reducible exchange of a single pseudoscalar meson between pairs of ( virtual ) photons ,",
    "their results @xcite read @xmath71 , \\nonumber\\\\ a_\\mu^{\\rm hlxl } & = & + 8.96(1.54 ) \\cdot 10^{-10 } \\quad [ 37 ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and show good agreement .",
    "but if one looks into the details @xcite of these calculations , there are sometimes sizeable differences , either between contributions common to the two models , or in the contributions that are included or not .",
    "the limit of a large number of colours @xmath72 @xcite can be useful in order to organize the various contributions @xcite . at leading order , one has to consider contributions from reducible single meson exchanges ( pseudoscalars , axial vectors , tensors ) . of these",
    ", those of higher masses will have their contributions suppressed , so that the contribution from single @xmath73 exchanges dominates .",
    "this is indeed the case in the models that have been considered in @xcite . in the framework of the effective low - energy theory , the leading - order contribution",
    "can be worked out exactly @xcite , @xmath74   .",
    "\\label{large - nc}\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath75 is the pion - decay constant ( @xmath76 in the large-@xmath72 limit ) , and @xmath77 , the mass of the @xmath78 meson , is a typical hadronic mass scale where the effective theory ceases to be applicable .",
    "the constant @xmath79 in front of the subleading contribution is related @xcite to a low - energy constant @xmath80 @xcite that also appears in the decay @xmath81 , and can thus be extracted @xcite from data . the last constant , @xmath82 , is not fixed by any requirement . in ( [ large - nc ] ) , the sign of the leading contribution comes out as positive .",
    "since it results from a model - independent approach , this result has a general validity . in model calculations",
    ", the scale @xmath77 enters through the form factors that describe the @xmath83 vertex , and which are necessary in order to make the contribution from @xmath73 exchange finite ( taking the constant vertex that follows from the wess - zumino term would lead to a divergent contribution ) .",
    "as the uv - regulator @xmath77 is sent to infinity , one should recover the behaviour ( [ large - nc ] ) .",
    "this has been checked in a variety of models @xcite .",
    "although the pion - exchange practically gives the final result in @xcite , this partly also results from the cancellation among other contributions , which , taken individually , can be sizeable .",
    "some of these contributions are regularly updated or reevaluated ( for a recent example see @xcite , and the contributions in @xcite ) .",
    "there are also contributions coming from short distances , and an important issue is the matching between contributions arising from different scales and regimes .",
    "this is certainly a feature that one should improve .",
    "for instance , although some short - distance constraints are implemented @xcite , an extensive study of the four - point function ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) from this point of view has not been done so far .",
    "eventually , the total error on @xmath84 will not only reflect our ability to reduce the errors on individual contributions , but must also reflect our confidence in the way we are able to put them together , while respecting the known properties of qcd at short and at long distances .    in order to summarize the present situation",
    ", one may quote the  best estimate \" from @xcite @xmath85 whereas a more conservative estimate @xcite gives @xmath86 in the case of the electron , this contribution is much smaller , and one finds @xcite @xmath87",
    "the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and of the muon are among the most precisely measured low - energy observables of the standard model .",
    "the standard - model value obtained for @xmath10 agrees with the experimental measurement @xmath88 however , at present the value obtained for @xmath0 wihin the standard model misses the experimental one .",
    "the difference @xmath89 ranges from @xmath90 , taking the inputs from @xcite for hvp and from @xcite for hlxl , @xmath91 , \\ ] ] to @xmath92 , @xmath93 , \\ ] ] when the inputs for hvp and hlxl are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this discrepancy has been with us for quite some time , and it is not obvious to find a straightforward explanation for it .",
    "it is almost twice as large as the correction from the weak interactions ( section 3 ) , and the evaluation of the hadronic light - by - light correction would have to be off by a factor of 2 to 3 to explain it .",
    "could it come from higher order qed effects ?",
    "after all , the coefficients @xmath28 in table [ table_1 ] display a dramatic increase with @xmath94 .",
    "an estimate of the contribution at twelfth order @xmath95 that shows the enhancement mechanism mentioned previously , based on the electron ligh - by - light loop @xmath96 , corrected by three electron loops , inserted in all possible ways in the three photon lines that are internal to the diagram , gives @xcite @xmath97 ^ 3 \\cdot 10 \\nonumber\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\!\\ !",
    "& \\sim & \\!\\ ! 0.6 \\cdot 10 ^ 4 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding contribution to @xmath0 , @xmath98 is however way too small to explain even part of the discrepancy .",
    "could higher order qcd effects be at work ?",
    "besides @xmath99 @xcite already included , higher - order corrections to @xmath100 have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "the estimated value @xmath101 again fails to match the size of the discrepancy .    finally , are we already seeing manifestations of bsm degrees of freedom ?",
    "there are many proposals , see e.g. @xcite , but the present situation is clearly inconclusive .",
    "+ clarification will hopefully come from two new experiments , that are being prepared at fnal @xcite and at j - parc @xcite , with the aim of reducing the experimental uncertainty by a factor of 4 . in order to lead to a conclusive situation",
    ", these experimental efforts need to be met by a comparable improvement of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "forthcoming high - precision data from e.g. vepp-2000 , babar , besiii or kloe-2 , should allow for a further reduction of the uncertainty on the hadronic vacuum polarization part , probably below the 0.5% level .",
    "hadronic light - by - light will then become the dominant source of theoretical errors .",
    "there are proposals to address this issue @xcite , but much remains to be done in order to lead these programs to the desired goal . finally ,",
    "increasing efforts are being made in order to obtain reliable evaluations of the hadronic contributions to @xmath0 from qcd simulations on the lattice .",
    "the success of this enterprise will hinge on the ability to develop appropriate strategies to overcome the limitations set by the lattice .",
    "for interesting proposals and recent advances in this direction , see @xcite and references therein , or the contributions in @xcite , as well as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this , admittedly incomplete , list of items and of references should merely convey the feeling that the subject remains very active also at the theoretical level .",
    "although the challenge is high , it is reasonable to expect that significant improvements will become available around the time the data from the new experiments will be released .",
    "+ i would like to close this review with a short remark concerning the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "although @xmath10 is expected to be less sensitive to new physics than @xmath0 by a about a factor @xmath102 , there are exceptions to this naive scaling , and moreover @xmath10 is measured with a precision that is @xmath103 times better than the experimental precision on @xmath0 .",
    "this leads one to consider the possibility @xcite that degrees of freedom beyond the standard model could be first detected in @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , improvements on both @xmath25 and on the experimental determination of @xmath42 are within reach @xcite on a timescale comparable to the new generation of @xmath104 experiments at fnal and at j - parc .",
    "we are therefore looking forward to very exciting times in high - precision physics with the forthcoming experiments and , hopefully , with the accompanying improvements on the theoretical aspects .",
