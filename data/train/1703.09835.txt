    "@xcite .    by reducing the impact of gate - dependent errors ,",
    "the present work enables randomized benchmarking to more reliably diagnose the presence of non - markovian noise .",
    "more precisely , there are two key assumptions that may not hold well enough for the standard exponential decay model to be valid , namely , markovianity and time - independence .",
    "however , the only effect that time - dependent noise can have is to alter the rate at which the survival probability decays  @xcite .",
    "consequently , any `` revivals '' in rb experiments , that is , statistically significant increases in the average survival probability as @xmath10 increases ,  @xcite can be attributed directly to the noise being non - markovian .",
    "an intriguing observation from the present analysis is that gate - dependent fluctuations may produce a significant deviation from the exponential fit for short sequences .",
    "this deviation is possible because the first few values of @xmath10 are the most sensitive to gate - dependent fluctuations , which may be as large as @xmath212 for @xmath213 and @xmath78 for @xmath214 .",
    "consequently , these sequence lengths should be omitted when fitting to [ eq : fidelity_decay ] , but can also indicate the presence of gate - dependent noise .",
    "recent work has criticized previous rb analysis for not being invariant under gauge transformations of the form @xmath215 applied to states , channels and measurement operators respectively , where @xmath216 is any invertible linear map  @xcite .",
    "as this transformation does not change any observable properties , the quantities estimated by any characterization protocol should be invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "the present analysis is invariant under such transformations as the decay rate is an eigenvalue problem and applying a gauge transformation @xmath217 maps @xmath218 and @xmath219 in [ thm : avnoise ] and so @xmath161 is gauge - invariant .    ref .",
    "@xcite also provided methods to more closely approximate the rb decay rate under gate - dependent noise .",
    "these methods are superseded by the present analysis , which provides an explicit , constructive solution with an interpretation that is more robust to gate - dependent perturbations .",
