    "we propose and evaluate two repository replication models that rely on _ shared , existing _ network - accessible infrastructure .",
    "our goal is not to `` hijack '' other sites storage , but to take advantage of protocols which have persisted through many generations and which are likely to be supported well into the future .",
    "the premise is that if archiving can be accomplished within a widely - used , already deployed infrastructure whose operational burden is shared among many partners , the resulting system will have only an incremental cost and be tolerant of dynamic participation . with this in mind",
    ", we examine the feasibility of repository replication using usenet news ( nntp , @xcite ) and email ( smtp , @xcite ) .",
    "there are reasons to believe that both email and usenet could function as persistent , if diffuse , archives .",
    "nntp provides well - understood methods for content distribution and duplicate deletion ( deduping ) while supporting a distributed and dynamic membership .",
    "the long - term persistence of news messages is evident in `` google groups , '' a usenet archive with posts dating from may 1981 to the present  @xcite .",
    "even though blogs and forums have supplanted usenet in recent years , many communities still actively use moderated news groups for discussion and awareness . although email is not usually publicly archivable , it is ubiquitous and frequent .",
    "for example , our departmental smtp email server alone averaged over 16,000 daily outbound emails to more than 4000 unique recipient servers during a 30-day test period . given enough time ,",
    "attaching repository contents to outbound emails may prove to be an effective way to disseminate contents to previously unknown locations .",
    "open source products for news ( `` inn '' ) and email ( `` sendmail '' and `` postfix '' ) are widely installed , so including a preservation function would not impose a significant additional administrative burden .",
    "these approaches do not address the more complex aspects of preservation such as format migration and emulation , but they do provide alternative methods for refreshing the repository contents to a variety of recipients , known and unknown",
    ". there may be quicker and more direct methods of synchronization for some repositories , but the proposed methods have the advantage of working with firewall - inhibited organizations and repositories without public , machine - readable interfaces .",
    "for example , many organizations have web servers which are accessible only through a vpn , yet email and news messages can freely travel between these servers and other sites without compromising the vpn . piggybacking on mature software implementations of these other , widely deployed internet protocols",
    "may prove to be an easy and potentially more sustainable approach to preservation .",
    "digital preservation solutions often require sophisticated system administrator participation , dedicated archiving personnel , significant funding outlays , or some combination of these . some approaches , for example intermemory  @xcite , freenet  @xcite , and free haven  @xcite ,",
    "require personal sacrifice for public good in the form of donated storage space . however , there is little incentive for users to incur such near - term costs for the long - term benefit of a larger , anonymous group .",
    "in contrast , lockss  @xcite provides a collection of cooperative , deliberately slow - moving caches operated by participating libraries and publishers to provide an electronic `` inter - library loan '' for any participant that loses files .",
    "because it is designed to service the publisher - library relationship , it assumes a level of at least initial out - of - band coordination between the parties involved .",
    "its main technical disadvantage is that the protocol is not resilient to changing storage infrastructures .",
    "the rsync program  @xcite has been used to coordinate the contents of digital library mirrors such as the arxiv eprint server but it is based on file system semantics and can not easily be abstracted to other storage systems .",
    "peer - to - peer services have been studied as a basis for the creation of an archiving cooperative among digital repositories  @xcite .",
    "the concept is promising but their simulations indicated scalability is problematic for this model .",
    "the usenet implementation @xcite of the eternity service @xcite is the closest to the methods we propose .",
    "however , the eternity service focuses on non - censorable anonymous publishing , not preservation per se .",
    "we began by creating and instrumenting a prototype system using popular , open source products : fedora core ( red hat linux ) operating system ; an nntp news server ( inn version 2.3.5 ) ; two smtp email servers , postfix ( version 2.1.5 ) and sendmail ( version 8.13.1 ) ; and an apache web server ( version 2.0.49 ) with the mod_oai module installed @xcite . figure [ archpic ] illustrates the prototype environment we installed .",
    "no server was dedicated to news or mail ; they also provided services to other users , including project development environments , operational software , and web services .",
    "_ mod_oai _ is an apache module that provides open archives protocol for metadata harvesting ( oai - pmh ) @xcite access to a web server . unlike most oai - pmh implementations",
    ", mod_oai does not just provide metadata about resources , it can encode the entire web resource itself in mpeg-21 digital item declaration language @xcite and export it through oai - pmh .",
    "there are many kinds of digital libraries and a wide variety of repository file formats in use today .",
    "web access to library content is becoming more common , keeping pace with internet growth and facilitated by the many tools which convert hitherto proprietary content to html , pdf , or other web - compatible formats . in keeping with this trend toward internet accessibility , we created a small repository of web resources consisting of 72 files in html , pdf and various image ( gif , jpeg , and png ) formats .",
    "we used our own synthetic web site creation tool , building small html pages containing a table , some random text , and a few images as well as links to other pages in the web site .",
    "the pdf files were simple text pages .",
    "the files were organized into a few subdirectories with file sizes ranging from less than 1 kilobyte up to 1.5 megabytes , and the total web site size was approximately 30 mb .    for the nntp part of the experiment ,",
    "we configured the inn news server with common default parameters : messages could be text or binary ; maximum message life was 14 days ; and direct news posting was allowed . for email , we did not impose restrictions on the size of outgoing attachments and messages .",
    "we created the archive messages within the postfix environment and sent / received the messages using sendmail . using custom nntp and smtp tools written mainly in perl and which were operated from remote clients , we harvested the entire repository over 100 times with each tool .",
    "we took advantage of oai - pmh and the flexibility of email and news to embed the url of each record as an x - header within each message .",
    "x - headers are searchable and human - readable , so their contents give a clue to the reader about the purpose and origin of the message .",
    "since we encoded the resource itself in base64 , this small detail can be helpful in a forensic context .",
    "if the url still exists , then the x - headers could be used to re - discover the original resource .",
    "table  [ xhead ] is a set of actual x - headers added to an archival message , to facilitate discovery and recovery of the replicated record .",
    ".example of human - readable x - headers added to archival messages [ cols= \" < \" , ]     [ steps ]    figure  [ archpic ] graphically illustrates the process for each replication method . in sections",
    "[ newsproto ] and [ emailproto ] we discuss the specific details of , and differences between , using news and email for repository replication .      a testament to internet diversity , usenet groups exist in many formats . for our experiment",
    ", we created a _ moderated _ newsgroup which means that postings must be authorized by the newsgroup owner .",
    "this is one way newsgroups keep spam from proliferating on the news servers .",
    "we also restricted posts to selected ip addresses and users , further reducing the `` spam window '' and ensuring our live experiment would not be compromised by external news agents and usenet enthusiasts .",
    "since the news server was running on a live system used by many people not participating in the project , controlling access was important .",
    "for the experiment , we named our newsgroup `` repository.odu.test1 , '' but groups can have any naming scheme that makes sense to the members .",
    "for example , a dns - based scheme that used `` repository.edu.cornell.cs '' or `` repository.uk.ac.soton.psy '' would be a reasonable naming convention .    using the algorithm outlined",
    ", we created a news message for each record in the repository ( cf .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "we also collected statistics on ( a ) original record size vs. posted news message size ; ( b ) time to harvest , convert and post a message ; and ( c ) the impact of line length limits in news posts .",
    "our experiment showed high reliability for replicating using nntp .",
    "100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server , `` beatitude . '' in addition , 100% of the records were almost instantaneously mirrored on a subscribing news server ( `` beaufort '' ) .",
    "a network outage during one of the experiments temporarily prevented communication between the two news servers , but the records were replicated as soon as connectivity was restored .",
    "retrieving messages was as simple as pointing a news reader to the news server , and subscribing to the `` repository.odu.test1 '' news group .",
    "the mechanics of taking an email message from the email queue , attaching the archive content , and reinserting it into the queue are depicted in figure  [ fig : outbound - a ] .",
    "the corresponding extraction of the archive attachment can be seen in figure  [ fig : inbound - b ] .",
    "we ran live tests , using postfix mail servers and a test archive to gather our data .",
    "note the oai - pmh style x - headers that are a part of the email message ; these are similar to the x - headers of the news - method messages .",
    "the few differences are due to the specific header limitations and requirements of each protocol .",
    "archiving records by piggybacking on normal email traffic requires sufficient volume to support the effort .",
    "analysis of outbound email traffic from our department during a 30-day period showed 505,987 outgoing messages to 4,493 unique hosts , with a daily mean frequency of 16,866 emails and a standard deviation of 5,147 . in figure",
    "[ fig : emaildis ] , the total number of emails sent to each domain is shown , along with a curve fit .",
    "a typical power law relationship was evident between the domain s rank and email volume sent to that domain .",
    "@xmath0    using the curve fit shown in figure  [ fig : emaildis ] , @xmath1 .",
    "please see the appendix for the list of the top 50 domains and volume of email sent to each . for further discussion",
    "it becomes necessary to calculate the amount of emails that are actually sent to a certain domain per day .",
    "the euler zeta function :    @xmath2    can be used to derive the constant @xmath3 regarding the overall email traffic volume @xmath4 : @xmath5    there are a number of processing parameters which can be tweaked while running the prototype .",
    "one factor is what we call `` granularity '' ( @xmath6 in table  [ simvars ] ) .",
    "this factor is in our prototype by definition always unequal to zero .",
    "the `` normal '' case would be @xmath7 which means every single email is selected to get an attachment of an harvested object .",
    "g can be less than zero in which case only every @xmath8 email is attached with an replication object . if , for example , @xmath9 only every other email is selected . on the other hand g can be greater than one , e.g. @xmath10 in which case three objects would be attached to every single email .",
    "granularity @xmath6 consequently either functions as a damping or accelerating factor considering the pace of repository replication .",
    "the effect of @xmath11 on the average time to deliver one email is shown in figure  [ fig : gran ] . with a lower g ( less emails selected for an attachment )",
    "the average delivery time decreases .",
    "the prototype is further able to maintain a history list ( pointer ) for each destination site .",
    "once this feature enabled , it guarantees that one destination domain does not receive duplicate records . the concept of a history pointer is further explained in section [ emailderiv ] .      having created tools for harvesting the records from our sample digital library , and having used them to replicate the repository , we were able to measure the results .",
    "how fast is each prototype and what penalties are incurred ?    using our nntp prototype replication tool , we tested posting messages in a variety of sizes .",
    "the live experiment was run more than 20 times during a course of 6 months . the total time ( @xmath12 ) to harvest a record ,",
    "encode it in base64 , transmit it , and post it to the news server ranged from 0.5 seconds ( 12 kb ) to 26.4 seconds ( 4.9 mb ) .",
    "of course , the total time to complete a baseline harvest of the repository varied with the bandwidth available during each experiment , ranging from 22.7 minutes to 30.9 minutes with a mean time of 23.8 minutes , standard deviation of 2.6 minutes , and median time of 22.9 minutes .    in our email experiment , we measured approximately a 1 second delay in processing email attachments of sizes up to 5 mb ( see figure  [ fig : filterpen ] ) .",
    "since the repository consisted of only 72 files and each file was less than 5 mb @xmath13 , the time to complete a baseline harvest using email , is rapid : only 72 emails need to be generated locally , which is a small fraction of the normal email traffic generated by the department .        besides the trivial linear relationship between repository size and replication time",
    ", we found that even very detailed x - headers do not add a significant burden to the process .",
    "not only are they small relative to record size ( a few bytes vs. kilobytes or more ) , but they are also quickly generated ( less than 0.001 seconds per record ) and incorporated into the archival message .",
    "both nntp and smtp protocols are robust , with most products ( like inn or sendmail ) automatically handling occasional network outages or temporary unavailability of the destination host .",
    "our experimental results formed the basis of a series of simulations using email and usenet to replicate a repository .",
    "when transitioning from live , instrumented systems to simulations , there are a number of variables that must be taken into consideration in order to arrive at realistic figures ( table  [ simvars ] ) .",
    "repositories vary greatly in size , rate of updates and additions , and number of records .",
    "regardless of the archiving method , a repository will have specific policies ( `` sender policies '' ) covering the number of copies replicated ; how often each copy is refreshed ; whether intermediate updates are sent between full backups ; and other institutional - specific requirements such as geographic location of archives and `` sleep time '' ( delay ) between the end of one completed archive task and the start of another .",
    "the receiving agent will have its own `` receiver policies '' such as limits on individual message size , length of time messages live on the server , and whether messages are processed by batch or individually at the time of arrival .",
    "l l l + & @xmath14 & number of records in repository + & @xmath15 & mean size of records + & @xmath16 & number of records added per day + & @xmath17 & number of records updated per day + & @xmath18 & news post time - to - live + & @xmath19 & `` sleep '' time between baseline harvests + & @xmath20 & records postable per day via news + & @xmath12 & time in days to complete a baseline using news + & @xmath21 & total number of records replicated using news + & @xmath6 & granularity ( records per email ) + & @xmath22 & records postable per day via email + & @xmath23 & total number of records replicated using email + & @xmath24 & rank of receiving domain + & @xmath3 & constant derived from euler zeta function + & @xmath25 & power law exponent + & @xmath26 & history pointer + & & +    [ simvars ]    a key difference between news - based and email - based replication is the active - vs - passive nature of the two approaches .",
    "this difference is reflected in the policies and how they impact the archiving process under each method .",
    "a `` baseline , '' refers to making a complete snapshot of a repository .",
    "a `` cyclic baseline '' is the process of repeating the snapshot over and over again ( @xmath27 ) , which may result in the receiver storing more than one copy of the repository . of course",
    ", most repositories are not static",
    ". repeating baselines will capture new additions ( @xmath16 ) and updates ( @xmath17 ) with each new baseline",
    ". the process could also `` sleep '' between baselines ( @xmath28 ) , sending only changed content during the interim , or none at all . in short , the changing nature of the repository can be accounted for when defining its replication policies .",
    "the time to complete a baseline using news is obviously constrained not only by its modification rate ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , but also by the size of the repository and the speed of the network .",
    "consider figure [ newstimeline ] which illustrates the generalized replication timeline for three different sender policies .",
    "baseline replication is only successful when the news server message life ( @xmath18 ) is larger than @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ varynttl ] shows how different message life limits can impact the feasibility of archiving the repository on a news server under different sender policies .",
    "[ fig : nttl ]    the red line ( marked `` x '' ) shows a message life that is not long enough for a single baseline to complete - i.e. , that @xmath12 is too large for the target news server .",
    "line `` y '' ( the green line ) represents a longer message life than line x , but there is still not enough time for the server to `` sleep '' between baseline archives . if the harvest restarts immediately on completion of the first baseline , a full copy can be maintained on the news server despite its message deletion rate .",
    "repository growth could quickly outpace this balance .",
    "finally , line `` z '' ( the blue line ) is long enough to allow two complete baselines ( copies ) to be sent , with a short sleep period between the baselines .",
    "a successful nntp - based replication strategy will balance @xmath18 , @xmath12 , and the repository s modification rate ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "working with the variables from table  [ simvars ] , we can develop a general formula to estimate the total number of records harvested from the repository and posted as news articles during @xmath30 days .",
    "these equations capture only discrete values and not transmissions in progress : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 for the sleep cycle , @xmath19 , the value varies by sender policy : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 the total number of records currently replicated at a particular news server @xmath37 on a given day @xmath30 takes into account the life time ( @xmath18 ) of news messages on that server : @xmath38    nearly all repositories will have daily updates and new additions that need to be accounted for when determining @xmath12 . even `` static '' repositories which do not accept new entries are likely to have a certain amount of periodic record modification as errors , for example , are found and corrected",
    ". a larger time gap between baseline harvest completion and news message expiration will give the harvesting repository more `` room to grow '' before the two timelines collide .",
    "nntp is an older protocol , with limits on line length and content which impact building the news messages . converting binary content to base64 overcomes such restrictions but at the cost of increased file size ( one - third ) and replication time .",
    "even though storage costs continue to decline , a complete baseline harvest with its associated metadata and base64 encoding could prove too large for a news server to support .",
    "on the other hand , the web infrastructure has a number of participants ( google groups , for example ) which are interested in maintaining cached versions of even very large sites . in this case",
    ", a single baseline with updates could prove to be an acceptable strategy for a repository .",
    "one major difference in using email as the replication tool instead of news is that email is passive , not active : the email approach relies on _ existing _ traffic between the host site and one or more target destination sites .",
    "fortunately , the prototype is able to attach files automatically with just a small processing delay penalty of less than 1 second . as it turns out though , maintaining a replication list ( history pointer ) for each destination site",
    "is critical if a baseline harvest is to be completed .    using the variables defined in table  [ simvars ]",
    ", we can develop a general formula to estimate the total number of records harvested in @xmath30 days to a specific destination : @xmath39 @xmath40[equ : qmail ] @xmath41[equ : h0 ] @xmath42[equ : h1 ] if the history list is maintained for every receiver domain , then the pointer value is equal to 1 , as indicated in equation [ equ : h1 ] ; but if the history pointer is _ not _ maintained , then the value varies between 0 and 1 ( zero and one ) as shown in equation [ equ : h0 ] . the value of @xmath43 is derived in equation [ probnewemail ] . unlike news , which is _ time _ oriented , the email approach is _ destination _ oriented .",
    "granularity ( @xmath6 ) and history - pointer values ( @xmath26 ) are important factors when calculating the replication estimate . completing a baseline using email",
    "is subject to the same constraints as news - repository size , number of records , etc .",
    "- but is particularly sensitive to changes in email volume .",
    "for example , holidays are often used for administrative tasks since they are typically `` slow '' periods , but there is little email generated during holidays so repository replication would be slowed rather than accelerated . on the other hand , the large number of unique destination hosts means that email is well adapted to repository discovery through advertising . in a single day",
    ", information about the repository can be disseminated to thousands of potential preservation partners .",
    "in addition to an instrumented prototype , we simulated a repository profile similar to some of the largest publicly harvestable oai - pmh repositories .",
    "the simulation assumed a 100 gigabyte repository with 100,000 items ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) ; a low - end bandwidth of 1.5 megabits per second ; an average daily update rate of 0.4% ( @xmath46 ) ; an average daily new - content rate of 0.1% ( @xmath47 ) ; and a news - server posting life ( @xmath18 ) of 30 days . for simulating email replication ,",
    "our estimates were based on the results of our email experiments : granularity @xmath7 , an average of 16866 total outgoing emails per day , and the power - law factor applied to the ranks of receiving hosts .",
    "we ran the nntp and smtp simulations for the equivalent of 2000 days ( 5.5 years ) .",
    "news - based replication is constrained primarily by network capacity and limits imposed by the receiving news server . except for inter - party agreements or some other trans - organizational coordination ,",
    "the receiver s policies , even when they are known , are usually unconfigurable by the sender .",
    "a local news server can influence remote servers by establishing its own @xmath18 , size limits , content type , etc .",
    "a news server may adopt some of the policies of the source server it is replicating , allowing posts to expire _ earlier _ than the local server s @xmath18 , but usually not allowing the posts to live _",
    "longer_. ultimately , the archivist must consider the balance between the repository s capacity to replicate via nntp and the news server s ability to support replication .    as figure",
    "[ fig : nttl ] illustrated , successful replication depends on @xmath12 being smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath12 using the average record size in the repository ( @xmath15 ) times the total number of records ( @xmath14 ) and the base64 encapsulation factor ( @xmath48 ) , divided by the net available bandwidth ( @xmath49 ) :    @xmath50    if the lifetime of a posting is shorter than the baseline harvesting time of the repository ( @xmath51 ) , then that news server will never hold a complete copy of the repository on any given day .",
    "another potential issue is that the sheer size of the repository may make full - content replication to a news server impractical because of limits in available processing time or host storage capacity , for example . in such a situation",
    "the repository could adopt a `` by - reference '' archiving policy .",
    "this approach is fast and efficient , since it stores only the metadata for each repository record rather than the content of the record . using equation [ equ : t_news ]",
    ", we see that a repository with @xmath52 records and per - record metadata of 1 kilobyte can be archived in less than 1 day ( ignoring updates and additions ) at speeds as slow as a dial - up modem ( 0.125 mbps ) : @xmath53 for very large and/or very active repositories , this kind of `` advertising '' may be the optimum solution .    in general ,",
    "the probability of a given repository record being currently replicated on a specific news server @xmath37 on day @xmath30 is a function of the number of records posted each day to the news server ( @xmath20 ) , the growth of the repository ( @xmath16 ) during those @xmath30 days , and the lifetime of the record on the server ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath54    figure [ fig : newspolicies ] illustrates how a sufficient grace period ( @xmath18 = 30 ) can support different repository replication ( sender ) policies . in one scenario ,",
    "continuous baselines are transmitted .",
    "new and/or modified records are queued as they occur .",
    "both the `` cyclic baseline with updates '' and the `` repeating baseline '' approaches eventually result in a steady - state amount of data existing on the news server .",
    "this amount is approximately equal to the bandwidth available between the repository and the news server , and is a gradually declining percentage of the repository as it continues to grow and modify records .    for the `` cyclic baseline with updates ''",
    "line in figure [ fig : newspolicies ] , we simulated a 6-week repeating cycle with certain `` sender policies '' : the entire repository is replicated twice , followed by updates only , then the cycle is repeated . with this approach , the news server maintains between one and 2 full copies of the repository , at least for the first few years .",
    "the worst replication performance can be seen in the `` single baseline with updates '' line of figure  [ fig : newspolicies ] . in this third approach ,",
    "the policy is to make a single baseline copy i.e. , a one - time event , which is followed by only record updates and new additions .",
    "even these are eventually removed from the news server as they reach the limit of @xmath18 .",
    "the result is a rapidly decreasing percentage of repository replication over time .",
    "eventually , only 30-days worth of new data exists on the server , since @xmath55 .",
    "usually , this would be a very small portion of the repository compared with the other two policies , which can maintain up to @xmath56 versus @xmath57 , for example .",
    "it is obvious that as a repository grows and other factors such as bandwidth and news posting time remain constant , the news server eventually contains less than 100% of the library s content , even with a policy of continuous updates .",
    "nonetheless , a significant portion of the repository remains replicated for many years if the news server has a sufficient @xmath18 .",
    "smtp - based replication is constrained not only by the frequency of outbound emails , but also by the policies adopted by the repository .",
    "consider the following two sender policies : the first policy maintains just one queue where items of the repository are being attached to every @xmath8 email regardless of the receiver domain .",
    "this policy also randomly assigns a record , without maintaining a history pointer of records which have already been replicated .",
    "this is the easiest policy to implement since no history pointers are maintained , but it will take much longer for a particular domain to receive all records since many duplicate records will likely be sent while unsent record remain . in the second policy , we have more than one queue where we keep a pointer for every receiver domain and attach items to every @xmath8 email going out to these particular domains .",
    "thus , domain x will receive a new record in each attachment .",
    "duplicates will only begin once a baseline to that domain has completed .",
    "the second policy allows each receiving domain to converge on 100% coverage much faster .",
    "however , this efficiency comes at the expense of the sending repository tracking separate queues for each receiving domain .",
    "the impact of email s power law distribution is readily seen when comparing the coverage of higher - frequency ranks ( 1 through 5 , for example ) with lower - frequency ranks .",
    "receiver domains ranked 2 and 3 achieve 100% repository coverage fairly soon but rank 20 takes significantly longer ( 2000 days with a history pointer ) , reaching only 60% if no history pointer is maintained .",
    "figure [ fig : cvrg - a ] shows the time it takes for a domain to receive all files of a repository without the history pointer and figure [ fig : cvrg - b ] shows the same setup with a history pointer . in both graphs , the @xmath58 ranked receiver domain",
    "is left out because it represents internal email traffic .",
    "figure [ fig : cvrg - a ] clearly shows the impact of failing to maintain a record history . since there is a decreasing statistical likelihood of a new record being selected from the remaining records as the process progresses , it becomes less and less likely that a baseline harvest can be reached .",
    "thus , feasibility of replication via email @xmath22 is a function of the receiver s rank ( @xmath24 ) , the granularity ( @xmath6 ) , and probability based on use of a history pointer ( @xmath26 ) . working with the values obtained from our experiments where @xmath1 and total email volume per day = 16866 , and equation  [ equ:1cval ]",
    ", we find that the value of the constant @xmath3 is 7378.7 ; this value can now be used to determine the number of emails sent per day for each receiver domain by rank @xmath24 : @xmath59 a rank of 3 , for example , would mean 1,272 emails per day to that host .",
    "the total number of records replicated on day @xmath30 is : @xmath60    to give us a good opportunity to complete a baseline , we can set @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , we maintain a history pointer , and we do not skip any emails .",
    "this ensures that we do not send duplicate records before a baseline of the entire repository has been completed , and that we take full advantage of email traffic to that domain .",
    "it is obvious that increasing g would shift the graphs of both figures [ fig : cvrg - a ] and [ fig : cvrg - b ] up and decreasing it would just shift them down . using these values , we can calculate the probability that a record has been replicated via email : @xmath63    what if no history pointer is maintained ? in that case , we need to include the probability that a new record is attached to a given email , meaning @xmath64 is no longer one .",
    "the equation for @xmath26 is is a recursive calculation since it needs to account for the number of records already sent compared with the number of remaining , unsent records i.e. , non - duplicates . for simplicity , we assume that no duplicates are sent on the first day ( equation [ equ : h_d1 ] )",
    ". @xmath65-q_{email}}{[r+((r_u+r_a)\\times d)]}\\times h(d-1 ) \\label{probnewemail}\\ ] ]    @xmath66    in summary , one can argue that email may not be a practical solution for repository replication since the lower ranked domains will not get a full replication of a good sized repository in a reasonable time .",
    "the email approach does have a unique advantage : it offers a large number of hosts where the repository can be advertised .",
    "the scenarios we have described so far in this paper involve an unusually active repository , one which experiences a high rate of change in the form of new additions and updates to existing records .",
    "our hypothetical repository doubles in size in only 1000 days ( just under 3 years ) .",
    "we also used a relatively slow average network speed ( most institutions and even home users will have much higher average bandwidth ) , and further added an average 25% daily network down time .",
    "in other words , we stacked the deck against the nntp and smtp replication methods . despite these obstacles",
    ", the repository continues to be fully replicated on the news server for over 2 years .",
    "email as a replication tool poses several problems such as the passive nature of the process ( waiting for emails to be generated ) , and uncertainty about the persistence of the record on the receiving host . on the other hand ,",
    "the large number of domains that receive emails make this approach very compatible with a strategy of preservation - by - advertising : the greater the number of sites that are aware of a repository , the greater the likelihood that the repository will be found by interested users and - perhaps - replicated",
    ".    how would these approaches work with other repository scenarios ? if the archive were substantially smaller ( 10,000 records with a total size of 15 gb ) , the time to upload a complete baseline would also be proportionately smaller since , as we noted earlier , the replication time is linear with respect to the repository s size for both the news and email methods of replication .",
    "the news approach actively traverses the repository , creating its own news posts , and is therefore constrained primarily by bandwidth to the news server or limits on posts imposed by the news server .",
    "email , on the other hand , passively waits for existing email traffic and then `` hitches a ride '' to the destination host .",
    "the smtp approach is dependent on the site s daily email traffic to the host , and a reduction in the number of records has a bigger impact if the repository uses the email solution because fewer emails will be needed to complete a baseline harvest of the repository .      consider a mature repository with an initial size of 1 million records averaging 100 kb each ( totaling 95 gb of data ) .",
    "if the repository experiences a relatively low level of activity ( 10 new records ( 0.001 gb ) and 5 modifications ( 0.0005 gb ) ) , the sender can maintain at least 3 copies of the repository , including changes , for over 5 years using the nntp method .",
    "as before , we simulate a fairly low bandwidth ( 10 gb per day max capacity ) .",
    "the column `` mature '' in table  [ simcombo ] lists the repository values and the policy factors for both sender and receiver .",
    "l l c c c   + & & active & mature & new + & @xmath14 & 100,000 & 1,000,000 & 1,000 + & @xmath15 & 1 mb & 100 kb & 100 kb + & @xmath16 & 100 & 10 & 100 + & @xmath17 & 400 & 5 & 20 + & @xmath18 & 30 days & 30 days & 30 days + & @xmath19 & 3 days & 5 days & 5 days + & @xmath3 & 7378 & 7378 & 7378 + & @xmath25 & @xmath67 & @xmath67 & @xmath67 + & @xmath6 & 1 & 1 & 1 + & @xmath43 & 1 & 1 & 1 +    [ simcombo ]    figure  [ fig : mature2k ] illustrates a simulation using these values sent to a news server with the usual 30-day expiration time .",
    "the single baseline policy drops off because of the deletion of records from the news server every 30 days , but the cyclic and repeating baselines easily keep up with the deletion process throughout the 2000-day simulation . as table  [ simcombo ]",
    "notes , the replication target for the repeating baseline is 3 copies , and for the cyclic baseline it is 2 copies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mature200 ] gives a more detailed look at the first 200 days .",
    "notice that the cyclic baseline requires a few cycles before it settles down to maintaining about 2 copies on the news server .",
    "the peaks occur because record modifications are replicated as new posts , since previous news messages can not be modified directly .",
    "the total volume sent to the news server is thus the combined sum of records and the changes to those records .",
    "results for the same mature repository using the smtp method are shown in figure  [ fig : email_mature ] .",
    "we can clearly see the impact of maintaining a pointer ( figure  [ fig : email_matureptr ] ) versus without tracking the history ( figure  [ fig : email_maturenoptr ] ) .      the web , of course , is full of new repositories that are fairly active in terms of adding new content and making routine updates every day .",
    "the column labeled `` new '' in table  [ simcombo ] lists values for a hypothetical new repository .",
    "it starts out fairly small ( only 1000 records ( 0.1 gb ) ) , but adds new records at a higher rate than the mature repository ( 100 records ( @xmath68 ) per day ) .",
    "similarly , modifications to the new repository happen at a similarly higher rate ( 20 records ( @xmath69 ) per day ) than they do in the mature repository .",
    "although it would be reasonable to expect the high rate of change to slow over time as the repository matures , we maintained this high activity level throughout the 2000 days of the simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : growing2k ] shows the impact of sender policies on maintaining replicated baselines at the news server . despite the high activity rate , both the cyclic baseline and the continuous baseline policies manage to keep up with the job of replication for the entire simulation period .",
    "although the news server can no longer maintain 3 full copies of the repository with the continuous baseline strategy toward the end of the period , the news server retains at least one full copy of the repository for the entire time frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : growing200 ] gives a closer look at the first 200 days of the simulation .",
    "the graph clearly shows the impact of `` sleeping '' between the cyclic baselines : during the sleep period , many new records and updates are created , and records that were replicated earlier reach their @xmath18 .",
    "this stabilizes eventually , since even such a low bandwidth can push 10 gb per day to the news server .",
    "in other words , the repository can make up for lost time during the next `` awake '' cycle .",
    "compare these figures with performance for the same growing repository using the smtp method , as shown in figure  [ fig : email_growing ] .",
    "again , the impact of maintaining a pointer ( figure  [ fig : email_growingptr ] ) versus without tracking the history ( figure  [ fig : email_growingnoptr ] ) is obvious .",
    "one problem that repositories often face is how to improve their general visibility to other sites and potential clients .",
    "buried beneath a host of other , competing resources , repositories can become like the dead sea scrolls , hidden for digital decades . both the news and",
    "the email methods of replication can help solve this problem using features unique to oai - pmh : email , by virtue of disseminating information about the repository to a wide number of hosts ; news , thanks to the wide - ranging accessibility of usenet .",
    "the oai - pmh `` identify '' response could be effectively used to advertise the existence of a repository regardless of the replication approach or policies .",
    "after the repository was discovered , it could be harvested via normal means .",
    "this method can advertise even very large repositories , since only metadata is replicated .",
    "a simple oai - pmh `` identify '' record is very small ( a few kilobytes at most ) and would successfully publish the repository s existence in almost zero time regardless of the replication approach that was used .",
    "through prototypes and simulation , we have studied the feasibility of replicating repository contents using the installed nntp and smtp infrastructure .",
    "our initial results are promising and suggest areas for future study .",
    "in particular , we must explore the trade - off between implementation simplicity and increased repository coverage .",
    "for the smtp approach , this could involve the receiving email domains informing the sender ( via email ) that they are receiving and processing attachments . this would allow the sender to adjust its policies to favor those sites .",
    "for nntp , we would like to test varying the sending policies over time as well as dynamically altering the time between baseline harvests and transmission of update and additions .",
    "furthermore , we plan to revisit the structure of the objects that are transmitted , including taking advantage of the evolving research in preparing complex digital objects for preservation @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that a single , superior method for digital preservation will emerge . several concurrent ,",
    "low - cost approaches are more likely to increase the chances of preserving content into the future .",
    "we believe the piggyback methods we have explored here can be either a simple approach to preservation , or a complement to existing methods such as lockss , especially for content unencumbered by restrictive intellectual property rights .",
    "even if nntp and smtp are not used for resource transport , they can be effectively used for repository awareness . we have not explored what the receiving sites do with the content once it has been received . in most cases ,",
    "it is presumably unpacked from its nntp or smtp representation and ingested into a local repository .",
    "on the other hand , sites with apparently infinite storage capacity such as google groups could function as long - term archives for the encoded repository contents .",
