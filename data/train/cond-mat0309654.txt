    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the mgb@xmath1 compound , several authors have investigated the properties of such superconductor in the presence of magnetic fields . it has been shown that the electric , magnetic and transport properties of mgb@xmath1 are strongly affected by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "such enhanced field dependence of the properties of mgb@xmath1 has been ascribed to the peculiar two - gap structure , with a larger gap , associated with the two - dimensional @xmath3 band , and a smaller gap , associated with the three - dimensional @xmath4 band , which is rapidly suppressed by the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "measurements of the microwave ( mw ) surface resistance , @xmath5 , allow investigating the processes responsible for mw energy losses in superconductors as well as determining specific properties of the samples . it is well known that the mw surface resistance of superconductors in the mixed state depends on the magnetic field through several mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the different vortex states , in the different regions of the h - t plane , determine the temperature and field dependencies of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , measurements of @xmath6 may provide important information on the fluxon dynamics in the different regimes of fluxon motion .",
    "it has been shown that mw losses in mgb@xmath1 superconductor are strongly affected by the magnetic field in the whole range of temperatures below @xmath2 , even for relatively low field values @xcite . in particular , an unusually enhanced field dependence of @xmath5 has been observed at @xmath7 , where pinning effects should hinder the energy losses .    in this paper , we report experimental results of the field - induced variations of the mw surface resistance in high - density ceramic mgb@xmath1 . below @xmath8 , we have observed a magnetic hysteresis in the @xmath0 curves , whose peculiarities can not straightforwardly be justified by models reported in the literature . on the contrary ,",
    "the experimental results obtained near @xmath2 are well accounted for in the framework of the coffey and clem model @xcite , with fluxons moving in the flux - flow regime , provided that the anisotropy of the upper critical field is taken into due account .",
    "the field - induced variations of @xmath5 have been studied in a bulk ceramic mgb@xmath1 sample of approximate dimensions 2@xmath93@xmath90.3 @xmath10 , with @xmath11 39 k. the sample has been extracted from a high - density pellet ( 2.4 g/@xmath12 ) obtained by reactive infiltration of liquid mg on a powdered b preform @xcite . after the reaction in a sealed stainless steel container , lined with a nb foil , a thermal treatment has been performed for two hours at @xmath13 900 @xmath14c .",
    "the mw surface resistance has been measured using the cavity perturbation technique .",
    "the cavity , of cylindrical shape with golden - plated walls , is tuned in the te@xmath15 mode resonant at 9.6 ghz ( @xmath16-factor @xmath17 40,000 at @xmath18 k ) .",
    "the sample is put in the center of the cavity by a sapphire rod , in the region of maximum mw magnetic field .",
    "the cavity is placed between the poles of an electromagnet , which generates dc magnetic fields up to @xmath17 10 koe .",
    "two additional coils allow reducing to zero the residual field and working at low magnetic fields .",
    "the quality factor of the cavity has been measured by an hp@xmath19d network analyzer .",
    "@xmath5 has been investigated as a function of the dc magnetic field , @xmath20 , in the range 0 @xmath21 10 koe , at fixed values of temperature . before each measurement",
    "was performed , the sample was zero - field cooled ( zfc ) to the desired value of temperature ; the external field was then increased up to 10 koe and successively decreased to zero , at constant temperature . the sample and field geometry is shown in fig.1 a ) ; in this geometry the mw current induces a tilt motion of all the fluxons present in the sample , as shown in fig.1 b ) .",
    "fig.2 shows the field dependence of @xmath5 , normalized to the normal - state surface resistance , @xmath22 , measured at @xmath23 = 40 k , for different values of the temperature .",
    "open and solid symbols refer to results obtained on increasing and decreasing @xmath20 , respectively . as one can see , up to @xmath24 4 k below @xmath2",
    "the @xmath0 curves show a magnetic hysteresis .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of the height of the hysteresis loop at @xmath20 = 0 , @xmath25 , i.e. the variation of @xmath26 after a complete cycle of the dc magnetic field from 0 to 10 koe and back . on increasing the temperature up to @xmath13 34 k",
    ", @xmath25 takes a constant value ; on further increasing the temperature it quickly decreases ; the hysteretic behavior vanishes at temperatures very close to @xmath2 .",
    "both the increasing and decreasing - field branches of the @xmath0 curves show a plateau in the field ranges 0 @xmath21 @xmath27 and 0 @xmath21 @xmath28 , respectively . since the sample was zfc , @xmath27 marks the first - penetration field .",
    "fig.3 a ) shows @xmath27 as function of temperature ; the line has been obtained by fitting the experimental data with the law @xmath29 $ ] ; we have obtained , as best - fit parameters , @xmath30 = 390 @xmath31 20 oe and @xmath32 = 2.4 @xmath31 0.2 .",
    "the @xmath32 value gives a temperature dependence of @xmath27 consistent with that of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath30 is slightly larger than the values of @xmath34 reported in the literature for mgb@xmath1 , suggesting that in our sample surface - barrier effects are weak .     at different values of temperature .",
    "open and solid symbols refer to measurements performed at increasing and decreasing field , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the height of the hysteresis loop at @xmath20 = 0 as a function of temperature.,width=264,height=510 ]    fig.3 b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath28 , though the meaning of this characteristic parameter is not clear , one can note that its temperature dependence is very similar to that of @xmath27 .     and",
    "@xmath28 , defined in fig.2.,width=245,height=245 ]",
    "microwave losses induced by dc magnetic fields in superconductors in the mixed state are proportional to the complex penetration depth of the mw field , @xmath35 ; they are influenced by the fluxon motion and the very presence of vortices which bring along normal fluid in their core @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 can be expressed in terms of the normal - fluid density , flux - flow resistivity and @xmath36 ratio , where @xmath37 is the working frequency and @xmath38 the depinning frequency , with @xmath39 the labush parameter and @xmath40 the viscous - drag coefficient . for @xmath41",
    "the induced mw current makes fluxons moving in the flux - flow regime .",
    "otherwise , the fluxon motion is ruled by the strength of the restoring - pinning forces .",
    "our results show that for @xmath42 35 k the @xmath0 curves exhibit an hysteretic behavior , suggesting that pinning effects are important in this range of temperatures . on the contrary , for @xmath43 35",
    "k the hysteresis vanishes and fluxons should move in the flux - flow regime . actually , the results near @xmath2 can be accounted for by using the coffey and clem theory @xcite , with fluxons moving in the flux - flow regime , provided that the anisotropy of the upper critical field is taken into due account . following the same procedure of ref.@xcite , based on the assumption that the anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory is valid for mgb@xmath1 in this range of temperatures ,",
    "we have fitted the experimental data by taking the anisotropy factor , @xmath44 , as fitting parameter .",
    "the best - fit curves , along with the experimental data , are shown in fig.4 .",
    "for all the curves , the best - fit value of the anisotropy factor is @xmath44 = 3 , showing that in our sample the anisotropy of @xmath45 is constant in a range of temperatures of about 3 k below @xmath2 .",
    "the hysteresis of the @xmath0 curves , observed for @xmath42 35 k , should be related to the different value of the induction field at increasing and decreasing fields . both the normal fluid density and the flux - flow resistivity depend on the number of fluxons moving under the action of the mw current . in the field geometry we used the mw current",
    "induces a tilt motion of all the fluxons present in the sample ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "so , the hysteresis of @xmath0 should be directly related to the hysteretic behavior of the magnetization curve due to pinning effects .",
    "however , several anomalies can be highlighted in the @xmath0 curves at low temperatures .",
    "firstly , from fig.2 one can see that an unusually enhanced field variation of @xmath5 is observed , even at the lowest temperatures ; a magnetic field of 10 koe induces an @xmath5 variation of about 1/3 of the normal - state value .",
    "we suggest that such enhanced field - induced energy losses are ascribable to the effects of the two - gap structure of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the structure of vortices in mgb@xmath1 is characterized by two coherence lengths , associated with each band @xcite .",
    "on increasing the applied field , the giant cores start to overlap at field values much smaller than @xmath45",
    ". therefore , modest fields can suppress superconductivity between the vortices , resulting in an enhancement of the normal - fluid density @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this particular vortex structure can modify the interaction among vortices and pinning centers , giving rise to an unconventional shape of the pinning potential well .",
    "another anomaly concerns the shape of the decreasing - field branch of the @xmath0 hysteresis loop . by supposing fluxons in the critical state ,",
    "after the external field starts decreasing the variation of @xmath46 should be initially slow and then faster , no matter the field dependence of the critical current .",
    "so , a downward curvature of the decreasing - field branch of the @xmath0 curve is expected , at variance with our results .",
    "the origin of this anomalous behavior , as well as the presence of the wide plateau in the decreasing - field @xmath0 curves , is not yet understood and needs further investigation .    in conclusion , we have reported a detailed study of the field - induced variations of the mw surface resistance in high - density ceramic mgb@xmath1 .",
    "an unusual behavior of the @xmath0 curves has been highlighted at low temperatures , which can not be explained in the framework of models reported in the literature .",
    "we suggest that it is ascribable to the unconventional vortex structure related to the presence of the two gaps . on the contrary",
    ", the results obtained at temperatures close to @xmath2 have been accounted for in the framework of the coffey and clem model , with fluxons moving in the flux - flow regime , by taking into account the anisotropy of upper critical field ."
