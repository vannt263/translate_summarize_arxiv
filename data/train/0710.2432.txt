    "[ sec : intro ]    this paper is concerned with the spectral geometry of compact riemannian orbifolds .",
    "the notion of riemannian orbifolds is a generalization of the notion of riemannian manifolds . in a riemannian orbifold",
    "each point has a neighborhood which can be identified with the quotient of an open subset of a riemannian manifold by some finite group of isometries acting on this subset .",
    "we omit the exact definitions for general riemannian orbifolds , which can be found , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , because actually we will be dealing in this article only with the special case of so - called `` good '' riemannian orbifolds .",
    "a good riemannian orbifold  @xmath3 is the quotient of a riemannian manifold @xmath4 by some group of isometries @xmath5 which acts effectively and properly discontinuously on  @xmath6 ; that is , for each compact subset @xmath7 , the set @xmath8 is finite .",
    "let @xmath9 be the canonical projection . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the isotropy group @xmath11 of  @xmath12 is defined as the isomorphism class of the stabilizer @xmath13 of  @xmath14 in  @xmath5 , where @xmath14 is any point in the preimage @xmath15 of  @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath11 is well - defined because for any @xmath16 the groups @xmath17 and @xmath18 are conjugate in  @xmath5 . by abuse of notation",
    "we will sometimes call @xmath17 ( instead of its isomorphism class ) the isotropy group of @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath11 is nontrivial then @xmath12 is called a singular point of  @xmath3 , and the ( finite ) number @xmath20 is called its isotropy order .",
    "the space @xmath21 of smooth functions on a good riemannian orbifold @xmath22 may be defined as the space @xmath23 of @xmath5-invariant smooth functions on  @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , smooth @xmath24-forms on  @xmath3 are defined as @xmath5-invariant smooth @xmath24-forms on  @xmath6 .",
    "since the laplace operator @xmath25 on @xmath4 commutes with isometries and thus preserves @xmath5-invariance , it preserves the space @xmath21 , and its restriction to this space is called the laplace operator on functions on  @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the laplace operator on @xmath24-forms on  @xmath3 is the restriction of @xmath26 to the space of @xmath5-invariant @xmath24-forms .",
    "again , these notions can be suitably defined also on general riemannian orbifolds and coincide with the given ones on good riemannian orbifolds . on every compact connected riemannian orbifold",
    "the laplace operator on functions has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath27 with finite multiplicities ; see  @xcite . for a good orbifold @xmath3 as above ,",
    "the eigenspace @xmath28 associated with the eigenvalue  @xmath29 of  @xmath3 is canonically identified with the subspace of @xmath5-invariant elements of the space @xmath30 of eigenfunctions associated with this eigenvalue on @xmath4 .",
    "two compact riemannian orbifolds are called isospectral if they have the same spectrum .",
    "to which extent does the laplace spectrum determine the geometry of a compact riemannian orbifold , and , in particular , the structure of its singularities ? there exist some positive results in this direction .",
    "an important general observation is that a compact riemannian orbifold which is not a manifold ( i.e. , has singular points ) can never be isospectral to a riemannian manifold with which it shares a common riemannian covering .",
    "this is shown in  @xcite using an asymptotic expansion by h.  donnelly of the heat trace for good compact riemannian orbifolds ; his result was made more explicit and generalized to non - good orbifolds in  @xcite .",
    "it is not known whether the statement concerning nonisospectrality of manifolds and orbifolds remains true without the condition of a common riemannian covering .",
    "e.  dryden and a.  strohmaier showed that on oriented compact hyperbolic orbifolds in dimension two , the spectrum completely determines the types and numbers of singular points @xcite . independently ,",
    "this had also been shown by the first author together with p.g .",
    "doyle ( unpublished ) . by a result of e.",
    "stanhope , only finitely many isotropy groups can occur in a family of isospectral orbifolds satisfying a uniform lower bound on the ricci curvature @xcite . on the other hand , n.  shams , e.  stanhope , and d.  webb have constructed arbitrarily large ( finite ) families of mutually isospectral riemannian orbifolds such that each of these contains an isotropy group which does not occur in any of the other orbifolds of the family @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for the maximal isotropy orders occurring in the orbifolds of such a family , the corresponding isotropy groups all have the same order , but are mutually nonisomorphic . a natural question arising in this context",
    "is whether it might be possible that two isospectral orbifolds have maximal isotropy groups which are not only nonisomorphic but even of different size .",
    "the only previously known examples of this kind concerned pairs of orbifolds with disconnected topology @xcite . the present paper , however , exhibits several kinds of examples of isospectral connected orbifolds with different maximal isotropy orders ; thus , using a popular formulation :",
    "you can not hear the maximal isotropy order of an orbifold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section  [ sec : sunada ] we recall brard s , ikeda s and pesce s versions of the sunada theorem and apply it to obtain a general construction of pairs of isospectral orbifolds with different maximal isotropy orders ( theorem  [ thm : genmax ] , corollary  [ cor : biinv ] ) , as well as some explicit examples . in this approach , the orbifolds arise as quotients of riemannian manifolds which are locally isometric to a compact lie group with a biinvariant metric , or , more generally , to a homogeneous space .    in section  [ sec : flat ] we recall some formulas developed by r.  miatello and the first author concerning the spectrum of flat manifolds and orbifolds .",
    "we use these to obtain several isospectral pairs of compact flat @xmath31-dimensional orbifolds , among these also a pair with different maximal isotropy orders ( example  [ ex : flat1 ] ) . in another example ( example  [ ex : flat2 ] ) ,",
    "the maximal isotropy groups are of the same size but not isomorphic , as in the examples by shams , stanhope , and webb  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sets of singular points of maximal isotropy order have different dimension in the two orbifolds .",
    "example  [ ex : flat5 ] is another example of this kind . in examples  [ ex : flat3 ] and [ ex :",
    "flat4 ] , all nontrivial isotropy groups are isomorphic , but again the topology of the singular sets is different .",
    "these two examples are obtained by the classical sunada construction .",
    "their existence within the context of flat @xmath31-dimensional orbifolds is interesting because it is known @xcite , @xcite that there do not exist nontrivial pairs of sunada isospectral flat manifolds in dimension three .",
    "see  @xcite for a more detailed treatment of some of the examples in this section .",
    "the first author would like to thank humboldt - universitt zu berlin , and especially dorothee schueth , for the great hospitality during his one year stay there .",
    "[ sec : sunada ]    the famous sunada theorem @xcite gives a general method for constructing isospectral manifolds and orbifolds . in order to formulate it and the versions given by p.  brard and a.  ikeda which we will use here ,",
    "one needs the notion of almost conjugate subgroups .",
    "[ def : almost]let @xmath32 be a group . two finite subgroups @xmath33 , @xmath34 of  @xmath32 are called _ almost conjugate in  @xmath32 _ if each conjugacy class @xmath35_g$ ] in @xmath32 intersects @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the same number of elements : @xmath36_g\\cap{{\\vargamma}}_1)=\\#([b]_g\\cap{{\\vargamma}}_2)$ ] .    the classical version of the sunada theorem says that if @xmath32 is a finite group acting by isometries on a compact riemannian manifold @xmath4 , and if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are almost conjugate subgroups of  @xmath32 acting without fixed points on  @xmath6 , then the quotient manifolds @xmath37 , @xmath38 , each endowed with the metric induced by  @xmath39 , are isospectral .",
    "if one drops the condition that @xmath33 and @xmath34 act without fixed points then the statement remains true in the context of riemannian orbifolds , as shown by p.  brard  @xcite . finally , a.  ikeda @xcite showed that the sunada theorem still holds in the case that @xmath32 is the whole ( necessarily compact ) group of isometries of @xmath4 , or any subgroup of the latter ( as his proof allows ) .",
    "although he did not formulate this result for orbifolds , the proof he gives in the manifold context carries over verbatim to the orbifold case . independently , h.  pesce @xcite had already given a version of the sunada theorem for compact , not necessarily finite  @xmath32 , with a slightly different ( but equivalent ) formulation of the almost conjugacy condition in representation theoretic terms .",
    "thus , one has the following theorem ( which can also be interpreted as a special case of a much more general result by d.  deturck and c.  gordon @xcite ) :    [ thm : sunada]let @xmath4 be a compact riemannian manifold , and let @xmath32 be a group which acts by isometries on @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two finite subgroups which are almost conjugate in  @xmath32 , then the compact riemannian orbifolds @xmath40 and @xmath41 are isospectral .    note that we have not assumed effectiveness of the action of the @xmath42 on  @xmath6",
    "however , by identifying @xmath43 with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the quotient of  @xmath42 by the kernel of its action , this orbifold is again seen to be a good riemannian orbifold in the sense of the introduction .",
    "we briefly sketch ikeda s particularly simple proof of theorem  [ thm : sunada ] : since @xmath32 acts by isometries , its canonical action on @xmath46 commutes with the laplace operator @xmath25 ; in particular , it preserves the corresponding eigenspaces @xmath30 .",
    "fix @xmath29 , let @xmath47 , and denote the action of @xmath32 on @xmath48 by @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath48 is finite dimensional since @xmath6 is compact .",
    "we have to show that for @xmath50 , the @xmath42-invariant subspaces @xmath51 of  @xmath48 have the same dimension .",
    "but this dimension is the trace of the projection operator @xmath52 ; it is thus equal to @xmath53 . since there exists a bijection from @xmath33 to @xmath34 which preserves conjugacy classes in @xmath32 , and thus traces , the two numbers are indeed the same for @xmath50 .",
    "[ rem : sunadaforms]sunada - isospectral orbifolds ( i.e. , isospectral orbifolds arising from theorem  [ thm : sunada ] ) are actually isospectral on @xmath24-forms for all  @xmath24 ; see the articles cited above .",
    "in fact , the above proof goes through without change if one replaces smooth functions by smooth @xmath24-forms .    if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not only almost conjugate , but conjugate in  @xmath32 then the situation becomes trivial ; in fact , if @xmath54 for some @xmath55 then @xmath56 induces an isometry between the riemannian orbifolds @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "fortunately there exist many triples @xmath57 where the @xmath42 are almost conjugate , but not conjugate in  @xmath32 .",
    "one example which we are going to use is the following :    [ ex : so6]let @xmath58 . writing diagonal matrices in  @xmath32 as the vectors of their entries on the diagonal , define @xmath59",
    "obviously there is a bijection from @xmath33 to @xmath34 preserving conjugacy classes in @xmath32 ; thus the two subgroups are almost conjugate in @xmath32 .",
    "( actually , the two groups can be seen to be almost conjugate by elements of the group  @xmath60 of even permutation matrices in @xmath32 , and thus almost conjugate _ in _ the finite subgroup of @xmath32 generated by @xmath61 . )",
    "this example corresponds to a certain pair of linear codes in @xmath62 with the same weight enumerator , mentioned in  @xcite .",
