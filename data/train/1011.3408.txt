    "at low temperatures , electron flow in mesoscopic systems bears analogies with the propagation of photons in quantum optics devices .",
    "the fermionic analog of the hanbury brown and twiss experiment for photon is an example : negative current - current correlations demonstrate that the statistics of current carriers in microstuctures corresponds to a degenerate fermi gas . over the last two decades , the issue whether all fermionic systems should demonstrate antibunching has been addressed .",
    "it was predicted that if electrons are injected from a superconducting lead , into a fork consisting of two normal metal leads , then positive current - current crossed correlations could be observed @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , called crossed andreev reflection ( car ) , has since been interpreted as originating from the splitting of the constituent electrons of a cooper pair from the superconductor into the two normal leads .",
    "because this cooper pair is a singlet pair of electrons , the two electrons which are injected into these leads should preserve their singlet nature , therefore providing a modern example of the non - local character of quantum mechanics in nanoelectronics.@xcite .",
    "bell inequality measurements based on noise crossed correlations have been proposed to detect this entanglement.@xcite        over the last decade , car has been studied extensively for a variety of geometries .",
    "the early proposals pointed out that positive crossed correlations can be generated either by selecting the energies of the outgoing electrons , or alternatively by filtering their spins.@xcite some theoretical works consider a superconductor connected in two separate locations to normal metal leads.@xcite such works address the effect of the separation between the normal metal leads on the car signal , and they specify which voltage configuration results in positive crossed correlations .",
    "other theoretical works consider hybrid structures where the normal leads are taken to be ferromagnets or half metals@xcite , semiconductors@xcite and luttinger liquids.@xcite recently the effect of coulomb interaction has been studied in some of these systems.@xcite    on the experimental side , noise experiments with normal superconducting devices constitute a real challenge .",
    "a successfull experiment demonstrated that the fano factor of a single ns junction is @xmath0 , corresponding to the charge of a cooper pair.@xcite one of the intrinsic difficulties lies in achieving controlled , good quality contacts between the two arms and the superconductor.@xcite it has also been suggested that non - local effects in the current ( andreev drag ) could be probed by placing two separate contacts to the superconductor .",
    "the first drag experiments were performed in this geometry @xcite , but one true challenge remains that the signal for drag effects is very weak , and again that symmetric contacts are difficult to achieve.@xcite    two recent experiments@xcite have provided evidence of cooper pair splitting in devices consisting of a superconducting finger placed on the bulk of a single nanowire , whose both ends are connected to metallic leads ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . because both the superconducting and the metallic leads are placed on top of the nanowire , two quantum dots are generated on both sides of the superconductor , and their energy levels can be controlled with the help of additional gates . this system constitutes a tunable cooper pair beam splitter with a relatively good degree of symmetry .",
    "differential conductance measurements showed appreciable non local signal which could be attributed to car .",
    "some results also suggest that local interaction and direct tunneling between the dots may play an important role . in this work , we choose specifically to focus on the geometry of refs . and .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to compute the branching currents of this device and their crossed correlations .",
    "these quantities depend strongly on the energy configuration of the dots as well as the presence of direct tunneling between them .",
    "in particular we study which parameters have to be optimized in order to achieve cooper pair splitting .",
    "while exploring the above physics , we put some emphasis in presenting the formal aspects of the calculation , which are achieved starting from a microscopic hamiltonian describing a bcs superconductor and normal leads , all coupled via tight binding tunnel hamiltonian to the dots . using a path integral formalism ,",
    "the leads degrees of freedom are integrated out , which is equivalent to resumming the dyson series in a perturbative green s function approach .",
    "this allows to obtain a rather general formula for the current in terms of the green s function of the dots .",
    "more importantly , we are also able to derive a general expression for the noise crossed correlations , in terms of a two particle dot green s function .",

    "increasing @xmath6 beyond @xmath133 , car is still dominant , but the currents cross ( @xmath131 as in section [ anti_symmetric_no_tunneling ] ) because both direct tunneling and ec from dot 1 to dot 2 come into play .",

    "this constitutes the justification for the side peak in the current - current correlation near @xmath135 to be smoothed out in the presence of strong tunneling . at the same time , for intermediate tunneling @xmath141 , the new double peak structure in the density of states of dot 1 at @xmath136 creates a structure in the ( positive ) current crossed correlation . further increasing @xmath55 , a peak in the crossed correlation around @xmath136 is generated : this peak is shifted towards @xmath142 in accordance with the shift in energy which is observed in the density of states of dot 1 .",

    "the two currents acquire an opposite sign and we observe two steps which correspond to the double peak structure in the density of states .",

    "to summarize , we have developped a framework for the description of the transport properties of a device consisting of a superconducting finger connected to two normal metal leads via two quantum dots adjacent to the superconductor .",
    "two recent experiments @xcite measured the branching currents in such a device , and showed that non local effects were at play , which is consistent with cooper pair splitting . yet it is now well accepted that the evidence of cooper pair splitting in such a device would be more robust if current - current crossed correlations were measured , which is the main justification for the present work .    for pedagogical reasons",
    ", we started our analysis with the description of a device where the superconductor is connected to a single dot ( which is in turn connected to normal metal leads ) , in order to derive the self - energy which arises from the coupling of the dot to all leads .",
    "next , we focused on the experimental geometry of refs . and with two dots , allowing for direct tunneling between the two .",
    "the current and noise crossed correlation were computed using the keldysh formalism .",
    "the branching currents were expressed in terms of the single particle green s function of the dot , which is dressed by the coupling to the leads , in the same spirit as the fisher - lee formula@xcite .",
    "similarly , the noise ( and in particular the noise crossed correlations ) was expressed in terms of a two particle ( dressed ) green s function for the dot variables .",
    "this second result corresponds to an extension of the fisher - lee / landauer - bttiker formula for the noise .",
    "provided a given choice of interactions within the dot ( coulomb , electron - phonon , ... ) these formulae for the currents and current - current crossed correlation are exact if the single and two particle green s functions can be computed . for our purposes",
    ", we chose to illustrate the operation of this device by ignoring such interactions . in this case",
    "the two particle green s function can be decoupled as a sum of products of single particle green s functions .",
    "the current and the noise crossed correlation were obtained numerically by solving the dyson s equation .",
    "given the complexity of the device , the number of parameters ( voltages , energy levels , resonance widths ) constrained us to focus on few specific cases .",
    "we focused on transport for voltages and energy levels all contained within the superconducting gap , because this corresponds to the regime where cooper pair splitting is understood to occur .",
    "we looked at two configurations for the dot energy levels : the antisymmetric configuration ( the two levels have opposite energies with respect to the superconducting chemical potential ) and the symmetric configuration ( same energies for the two levels ) . a crucial concept for",
    "the understanding of the generated data for current and noise is the density of states of the dots : due to the proximity effect induced by the presence of the superconductor , the density of states of a given dot acquires some weight ( `` small '' resonance ) at the energy which is opposite to the resonant energy of the bare dot ( `` large '' resonance ) .",
    "electron transport is therefore favored if the electrons can choose to be transfered via either a `` large '' or a `` small '' resonance of these dots .",
    "we fixed the voltage of a given lead within the gap , below all resonances , and we varied the voltage of the other normal metal lead within the whole gap .",
    "we started the discussion assuming no direct coupling between the two dots .",
    "on one hand we observed that car process is optimized in the antisymmetric case , when both normal lead voltages are below the dot density of states resonances . on the other hand we observed that ec process is the most important one in the symmetric configuration , when the voltage which is varied is set above all resonances . a systematic study of the current / voltage characteristic and of the noise / voltage characteristic allowed to identify precisely which processes ( car , dar , ec ) are into play when the voltage is increased .",
    "we argued that both the monitoring of the branching currents as well as the noise crossed correlations are necessary to identify these processes : for instance , dar processes contribute to the current , but not to the noise correlation signal .",
    "finally , we switched on the direct coupling between the dots and we repeated the analysis .",
    "the density of states of the dots undergoes strong modifications in the presence of such a coupling .",
    "this coupling has a tendency to spoil the positive correlations : for sufficiently strong coupling , positive correlations disappears altogether .",
    "we therefore provided a rather complete picture of the operation of this cooper pair beam splitter which could be useful in future noise crossed correlation experiments .",
    "several extensions of this work can be envisioned .",
    "first , we clearly neglected the separation between the two injection locations of the superconductor / dot interfaces . in all theoretical and experimental investigations",
    ", this separation @xmath154 has to be smaller than the superconducting coherence length ( the `` size '' of the cooper pair in the superconductor ) , because this leads to an exponential decay of the car ( and ec ) process .",
    "in addition to this reduction , a power law decay with @xmath155 ( which depends on the dimensionality ) is typically found theoretically,@xcite and it can lead to a strong suppression of car and ec processes . ref . did not find conclusive evidence of this power law suppression .",
    "it argued that the segment of the nanowire which is buried below the superconductor , which acquires a minigap , plays the dominant role for cooper pair splitting and should be immune to the power law decay because electrons are directly injected to the dots on both sides .",
    "nevertheless , further investigations of these power law suppression with our setup could provide additional insight .",
    "second , we have neglected the coulomb interactions within the dot , which is justified if the resonant linewidth is sufficiently large ( but not larger than the superconducting gap ) so as to constitute open quantum dots .",
    "the inclusion of interactions within the dots constitutes a definite challenge , and such interactions can in practice only be included via approximate treatments such as mean field theory , perturbative diagrammatic resummation , or kondo phenomenology . in practice ,",
    "electron interactions allow to transfer electrons one by one through each dot . in our device",
    ", we can only argue that successive cooper pairs emitted by the superconductor do not overlap significantly if the boundary between the superconductor and the dots is sufficiently opaque . in the two experiments which are relevant to this work",
    ", it was possible to characterize the dots by switching off the superconductivity by applying a magnetic field .",
    "such analysis clearly showed the presence of coulomb diamonds , and the boundaries between them allowed to identify parameters for resonant electron transfer .",
    "here we can only argue that regardless of the physical origin of such resonances , they will have a characteristic location and width associated with interactions , and they can be effectively tuned by adjusting the gate voltages on the two dots .",
    "the scenario for adjusting them antisymmetrically or symmetrically to favor car / ec processes should then be robust .",
    "but given the fact that our intermediate results for the current and noise can be expressed in terms of exact one and two particle green s functions , an extension of the present work including interactions using an approximate scheme is foreseeable in the future .",
    "finally , we have focused solely on the zero frequency noise crossed correlation signal .",
    "noise crossed correlations at finite frequencies contain additional information , such as the relevant time scale for cooper pair splitting in this particular device .",
    "several entanglement scenarios have addressed the importance of short times / high frequencies , for instance when performing an entanglement diagnosis.@xcite further investigations along these lines would prove useful .    _ note added in proof_. upon completion of the manuscript",
