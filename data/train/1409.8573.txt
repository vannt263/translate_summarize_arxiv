    "our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres relies on the remote sensing of radiation that , arising from the host star or the planet itself , becomes imprinted with some of the planet s atmospheric features .",
    "ongoing technological developments , to be implemented in @xmath430-m ground - based telescopes and dedicated space missions , are steadily increasing the number of exoplanets amenable to atmospheric characterisation . in the foreseeable future , sophisticated instruments will allow us to separate the radiation of an earth twin from the glare of its host star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and refs .",

    "as some of those works have shown , the information contained in spectra and colour photometry of the one - pixel images will inform us about aspects of the planet such as its atmospheric composition , existence of clouds , and land / ocean partitioning .",
    "a key aspect of models , and one that is investigated here , is their capacity to predict an exoplanet s remote appearance and , in particular , how to treat the three - dimensional nature of the atmospheres .",
    "the need for such a treatment becomes more apparent as a number of groups are beginning to explore the coupled effects of atmospheric dynamics , heat redistribution and chemistry in the framework of general circulation models .",
    "modelling radiative transport in three - dimensional atmospheres is a computationally intensive task .",
    "for that reason it is important to explore all possible avenues .",
    "the two most usual approaches to the problem are :    1 .",
    "the planet disk is partitioned into an @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 number of disk elements",
    ". the outgoing radiation is calculated at each discrete element under the approximation of locally plane - parallel atmosphere ; then , each discrete contribution is properly added up to generate the disk - integrated magnitude .",
    "its computational cost is proportional to @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 . as an example , simulating a fully - illuminated planet at the 2@xmath3@xmath62@xmath3 resolution level involves 8100 separate calculations .",
    "disk integration is directly approached by means of monte carlo ( mc ) integration .",
    "the mc scheme conducts one - photon numerical experiments , each of them tracing a photon trajectory through the atmospheric medium . repeating the experiment @xmath8 times results in an estimate of the disk - integrated outgoing radiation that converges to the exact magnitude with a standard deviation that follows a @xmath9@xmath10 law .",
    "@xcite utilised a forward mc algorithm to investigate the diurnal variability of the earth s brightness .",
    "forward refers to the tracing of the photons starting from the radiation source onwards through the atmospheric medium , _",
    "i.e. _ in the same order as the actual photon displacements . in the mc approach ,",
    "the total computational cost is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "recent work has introduced an alternative approach based on pre - conditioned backward monte carlo ( pbmc ) integration of the vector radiative transport equation @xcite .",
    "past applications of the pbmc model to the problem of scattering from a spatially - unresolved planet focused on atmospheres that might be stratified in the vertical but exhibited otherwise uniform optical properties in the horizontal direction .",
    "the importance of accounting for three - dimensional effects in the description of the optical properties of exoplanets has been substantiated by a number of works @xcite .    here ,",
    "i investigate further the pbmc approach and use it to explore earth s remote appearance for non - uniform distributions of cloud and surface properties",
    ". the methodology may find application in the interpretation of earthshine observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in related research fields such as climate studies that are concerned with planet - averaged properties .",
    "this is ongoing work that demonstrates the potentiality of the pbmc approach to become a reference technique in the production of disk - integrated curves for exoplanets .",
    "section  [ pbmc_sec ] introduces the method ,  [ atmosphere_section ] describes the atmospheric , cloud and surface properties implemented in the current exploration exercise , and  [ results_section ] comments on the phase and diurnal light curves of earth for a few wavelengths and two different cloud covers . finally , section  [ messenger_section ] introduces the brightness light curves of earth obtained with images from the 2005 earth flyby of the messenger spacecraft , and  [ outlook_section ] summarises the main conclusions and touches upon follow - up work .",
    "the fundamentals of the pbmc algorithm have been described @xcite , and the model has been validated for horizontally - uniform atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the validation exercise included a few thousand solutions from the literature for plane - parallel media , disk - integrated model solutions for rayleigh - scattering atmospheres and measurements of the disk - integrated brightness and polarisation of venus . in the comparison against other model calculations , typical accuracies of 0.1% and better",
    "are achieved .",
    "the algorithm calculates the stellar radiation reflected from the whole disk for planets with stratified atmospheres .",
    "the calculation proceeds by simulating a sequence of @xmath8 one - photon numerical experiments .",
    "being a backward algorithm , each experiment traces a photon trajectory from the observer through the scattering medium .",
    "the contribution to the estimated radiation as measured by the observer is built up by partial contributions every time the photon undergoes a collision .",
    "the simulation stops when the photon is either fully absorbed in or escapes from the atmosphere .",
    "pre - conditioning refers to a novel scheme that incorporates the polarisation history of the photon ( since its departure from the observer s location ) into the sampling of propagation directions .",
    "pre - conditioning prevents spurious behaviours in conservative , optically - thick , strongly - polarising media , and accelerates the convergence over the non - pre - conditioned treatment .",
    "the algorithm includes a scheme to select the photon entry point into the atmosphere based on the local projected area of the visible planet disk @xcite .",
    "this strategy ensures that all simulated photons contribute to the estimated radiation at the observer s location . in this approach , each solution to the radiative problem is specific to the details of the illuminated disk as viewed by the observer .",
    "changing that view requires a new radiative transport calculation .",
    "the implementation is based on the vector radiative transport equation , which entails that the model computes the disk - integrated stokes vector of the planet .",
    "not explored in past applications of the pbmc approach , the model is well suited for investigating planets with non - uniform distributions of clouds and albedos .",
    "the pbmc algorithm handles elaborate descriptions of the atmospheric , cloud and surface optical properties of the planet . to keep the number of parameters reasonable , however , it is convenient to introduce various simplifications , which are described in what follows .",
    "the model atmosphere adopted here includes gas and clouds and utilises a 30-slab vertical grid with resolutions of 1 , 2 and 4 km for altitudes in the 010 , 1030 and 3070 km ranges .",
    "the gas is stratified with a scale height of 8 km and the total rayleigh optical thickness is parameterised by @xmath11=0.1(0.555/@xmath12 [ @xmath2m])@xmath13 .",
    "clouds are placed in a single slab and assumed to be composed of liquid water and have wavelength - dependent real refractive indices ranging from 1.34 at 0.47 @xmath2 m to 1.30 at 2.13 @xmath2 m .",
    "the considered cloud droplet sizes have an effective radius and variance of @xmath14=7.33 @xmath2 m and @xmath15=0.12 , respectively , which is appropriate for continental stratus clouds @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix for the polarisation calculations is determined from mie theory @xcite . the cloud optical thickness @xmath16 is assumed to be the same for all clouds on the planet .",
    "the model atmosphere includes absorption by ozone in the chappuis band @xcite .",
    "the ozone vertical profile peaks in the stratosphere at 25 km and has an integrated column of 275 dobson units @xcite . ozone absorption is stronger between 0.55 and 0.65 @xmath2 m , and",
    "its effect on the radiative transport calculations is particularly distinct in that spectral range .",
    "no other gas molecular bands were considered , and therefore the study focuses on the spectral continuum rather than on strong absorption molecular features",
    ". future work will investigate the potential advantages of introducing the spectral direction into the monte carlo integration .",
    "foreseeably , associating each one - photon experiment with a properly - selected wavelength ( over an instrument s bandpass ) and with a photon entry point into the atmosphere may lead to further computational savings in the simulation of spectra with respect to the usual strategy of stacking many monochromatic calculations and subsequently degrading the so - formed spectrum .",
    "the savings are likely to be significant if the final spectra are only required at moderate - to - low resolving powers .    at the planet surface",
    ", the model adopts the modis white - sky albedos specific to early august 2004 @xcite .",
    "the albedos are available at bands centered at 0.47 , 0.555 , 0.659 , 0.858 , 1.24 , 1.64 and 2.13 @xmath2 m , which cover much of the spectrum dominated by reflected radiation .",
    "the bandwidths of the modis filters are of 2050 nm @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic model calculations presented here are carried out at the modis central wavelengths .",
    "the prescribed albedos are identically zero over the ocean .",

    "specular reflection at the ocean , which may contribute to the planet signal at large phase angles @xcite , will be implemented in later work .",
    "the adopted maps of cloud fraction are from modis dataid = modis@xmath17daily@xmath17l3 ] specific to 3rd august 2005 ( see section  [ messenger_section ] ) .",
    "for each one - photon experiment , a scheme based on the local cloud fraction @xmath18 at the photon entry point into the atmosphere determines the surface albedo to be utilised in that specific photon trajectory simulation and whether the photon is traced through a gas - only or gas - plus - cloud medium .",
    "internally , the scheme draws a random number @xmath19@xmath20[0 , 1 ] .",
    "if @xmath19@xmath21@xmath18 , the photon is traced through an atmosphere of optical thickness @xmath11+@xmath16 with optical properties within each slab properly averaged over the gas and cloud . otherwise ,",
    "if @xmath19@xmath4@xmath18 , the photon is traced through a gas - only atmosphere of optical thickness @xmath11 .",
    "both the input surface albedo and cloud fraction maps are averaged and mapped onto longitude / latitude maps of 2@xmath3@xmath62@xmath3 resolution . each map is read into the model at the beginning of the run and kept in memory throughout the simulation of the @xmath8 one - photon experiments .",
    "figure ( [ albedocloudmap_fig ] ) shows albedo and cloud fraction maps as sampled by the model in a run specific to the messenger view of earth on 18:30ut 3rd august 2005 .",
    "in the implementation of the pbmc algorithm , the irradiance @xmath22 at the observer s location is evaluated through a summation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the outgoing radiance stokes vector from the @xmath25-th one - photon experiment , the uniform random variables @xmath26 , @xmath27@xmath20[0 , 1 ] sample the planet visible disk and @xmath28 is the star - planet - observer phase angle @xcite . equation ( [ summation_eq ] ) is effectively an arithmetic average and its convergence properties depend on the dispersion in the outcome of the one - photon experiments .",

    "properly , the planet s scattering phase function also depends on the optical properties of the planet as viewed from the observer s location , and they may change over time .    to investigate the convergence properties of @xmath22 , it is convenient to introduce @xmath33 that defines the standard deviation for the first element @xmath34 of @xmath35 after @xmath8 one - photon experiments : @xmath36 and where @xmath37 is a short form for @xmath38 . in turn , for @xmath29 : @xmath39 analogous expressions can be written for the other elements of @xmath22 : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    figure ( [ histograms_fig ] ) shows histograms of the @xmath43 values obtained in the application of eq .",

    "it becomes clear that clouds broaden the possible outcome from the single - photon experiments , which affects the accuracy of the algorithm for a prescribed number of one - photon experiments . from the values of @xmath44/@xmath29 and computational times for @xmath8=10@xmath46 listed in table ( [ sigma_table ] ) , it is straightforward to estimate the accuracy and computational time for an arbitrary @xmath8 . in all cases ,",
