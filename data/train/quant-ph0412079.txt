    "the interpretation of quantum mechanics is based to a large extent on understanding the measurement process .",
    "this is because measurements are the interface between quantum systems and the observer .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of measurements in a very particular situation , namely we shall consider an observer inside an isolated system who attempts to measure the total energy of the isolated system .",
    "we shall be particularly interested in the time it takes the internal observer to measure the total energy .",
    "our analysis sheds light on several troublesome aspects of quantum mechanics : the nature of observable quantities in quantum mechanics , the interpretation of energy measurements , the interpretation of isolated systems and the interpretation of time for such systems .",
    "a central theme in our paper is the interpretation of the time - energy uncertainty relation in the context of energy measurements . before delving into the specific subject of this article",
    "it is useful to recall what is known about this question .",
    "it was initially believed ( in analogy with the situation for position and momentum analyzed by heisenberg ) that the precision @xmath0 with which the energy of a quantum system is measured and the time @xmath1 taken by the measurement are related by @xmath2 ( where we take @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "however it was shown by aharonov and bohm @xcite that this intuition is incorrect and that the energy of a quantum system can be measured in arbitrarily short time .",
    "( for a collection of reprints on quantum measurements , including the above two articles , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently it was realized that in order to carry out the fast measurement of aharonov and bohm the hamiltonian must be known before hand .",
    "if the hamiltonian is not known then the energy can not be determined instantaneously , and in this case the precision @xmath0 with which the energy of a system is measured and the time taken for this measurement are constrained by @xmath4@xcite .    in the works described above the measurement",
    "is carried out by an external observer who couples the system to be measured to an external measuring device for a time @xmath1 .",
    "aharonov and reznik @xcite added a twist to this problem by asking whether an observer internal to an isolated quantum system can measure the total energy of the system itself .",
    "they showed that such internal measurements of the total energy are indeed possible .",
    "aharonov and reznik illustrate this by a simple example in which a self gravitating system , say a planet of radius @xmath5 , ejects outwards a small mass @xmath6 . by measuring the time",
    "@xmath7 it takes the mass to fall back onto the planet one can determine the mass of the planet and thus deduce its total energy @xmath8 through the correspondence between energy and mass @xmath9 .",
    "aharonov and reznik also present a more abstract mathematical model to illustrate this , see section [ ii ] for a detailed presentation of this model .",
    "one of the main points of the present work is to show that in discussing the time taken to measure the energy of an isolated system one should make a distinction between the time measured by the external observer ( the external time @xmath10 ) and the time measured by the observer internal to the system ( the internal time @xmath11 ) . in particular when discussing the time energy uncertainty one should distinguish whether the duration of the measurement @xmath1 is measured in internal or external time .",
    "note that having the time of the internal and external observer differ is completely compatible with the usual principles of physics , and in particular with the general relativity where different observers have in general completely different time variables .",
    "we discuss this point further below .",
    "the works @xcite complemented with the results obtained in the present article show that the relationship between the precision @xmath0 with which the energy of a system is measured and the time @xmath1 taken for this measurement is much richer than previously thought .",
    "indeed there are many cases which can be considered according to whether the observer which carries out the measurement is internal or external to the system , according to whether the duration of the measurement is measured in internal or external time , and according to whether the hamiltonian of the system is known or unknown .",
    "table [ t1 ] summarizes these different possibilities as well as what is known about them .",
    "case 1 in the table is the situation analyzed in @xcite , case 2 is the situation analyzed in @xcite and case 7 is the subject of the present article .",
    "we will also make some comments about case 5 .",
    "note that little or nothing is known about most of the cases in the table .",
    "thus much more work is required to completely understand the status of the time - energy uncertainty relation in the context of energy measurements .",
    "[ t1 ]    .summary of relations between the precision @xmath0 with which the energy of a system is measured and the time @xmath1 taken for the measurement , according to whether the observer which carries out the measurement is internal or external to the system , according to whether the duration of the measurement is measured in internal or external time , and according to whether the hamiltonian of the system is known or unknown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now turn back to the case of the internal observer who wants to measure the total energy of an isolated system and who knows the hamiltonian of the isolated system . in the particular examples they analyze aharonov and reznik",
    "find an intriguing effect , namely that the precision @xmath0 with which the total energy is measured and the time taken for the measurement are not independent .",
    "they find that they are related by @xmath12 . on the basis of these examples they go on to argue that this is a fundamental constraint relating the precision with which the total energy of an isolated system is measured and the amount of time taken to carry out the measurement . a central result of the present article is to correct this statement .",
    "let us first note that if aharonov and reznik s claim was to be confirmed it would have important consequences for the interpretation of observable quantities in quantum mechanics because it would mean that there are quantities which are observable in principle , but are not observable instantaneously because they can only be measured in a finite time .",
    "this could give rise to some surprising ( even paradoxical ) situations @xcite and is contrary to the situation concerning all other measurements of observables .",
    "for instance it is quite obvious that a position measurement can be done arbitrarily fast . and",
    "it was shown in @xcite that any observable , and in particular the hamiltonian observable , can be measured in arbitrary short time .",
    "( note that the instantaneous measurements described in@xcite require a measuring device with arbitrarily large energy external to the system to be measured .",
    "they therefore can not be applied to measurements of the energy of an isolated system by an internal observer ) .    a clear understanding of measurements of total energy by an observer inside an isolated system therefore",
    "have direct bearing on the interpretation of quantum mechanics and in particular on what is meant by an observable quantity . in this paper",
    "we shall resolve the apparent paradox discovered by aharonov and reznik .",
    "to this end we must , as mentioned above , distinguish two notions of time for isolated systems .",
    "first there is the internal time @xmath11 .",
    "this is the time as measured by a clock inside the isolated system .",
    "we shall show by an example that the precision @xmath0 with which the internal observer measures the total energy of the isolated system and the amount of internal time taken for the measurement @xmath13 are not mutually constrained .",
    "in particular @xmath13 can be much smaller than @xmath14 , see case 7 in the table .",
    "( throughout this article we will denote by the capital letter t the duration of the measurement and by the small letter t the time variable . )",
    "second there is the external time @xmath10 .",
    "this is the time which would be measured by an observer outside the system .",
    "we do not know whether the precision @xmath0 with which the internal observer measures the total energy of the isolated system and the amount of external time taken for the measurement @xmath15 are mutually constrained , although it is tempting to conjecture , see section [ iv ] , that in this case @xmath16 holds .",
    "at present however we leave a ? in case 5 in the table .",
    "the resolution of the apparent paradox uncovered in @xcite is therefore that the internal observer can measure the total energy arbitrarily fast in his own proper time .",
    "similarly the total energy of the isolated system can be measured by the external observer arbitrarily fast @xcite .",
    "thus _ the energy of an isolated system can be measured arbitrarily fast in the proper time of the observer , whether or not he is internal to the system or not . _    as mentioned above having the internal and external times differ is nt in contradiction with basic physical principles . indeed in general relativity",
    "the clocks of two systems have no reason to be synchronized , or to stay so during their evolution .",
    "we can thus imagine that the isolated system is a planet .",
    "for an observer at the surface of the planet and an observer at infinity , the times differ by the gravitational red - shift factor : @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 is constant this is just a rescaling of time .",
    "but if @xmath18 changes during the energy measurement itself , than the amount of external time @xmath19 and the amount of internal time @xmath20 taken for the measurement may differ in a non trivial way .",
    "thus we can imagine that the measurement begins by a dynamical evolution during which @xmath18 decreases from its initial value to a very small value .",
    "this could for instance be due to a gravitational collapse of the planet which stops just above its schwarzschild radius .",
    "once @xmath18 is small the internal observable carries out the measurement of his total energy .",
    "once the measurement is finished the planet expands and brings @xmath18 back to its initial value .",
    "this shows that the measurement can have very different durations for the internal and external observer . in section [ iii ]",
    "we shall show that the duration for the internal observer can be arbitrarily short .",
    "furthermore @xmath18 is in fact an operator and can have uncertain value .",
    "this means that the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and hence the relation between internal and external time , becomes uncertain .",
    "this effect is inevitable and plays an essential role in understanding these measurements , as we discuss below .    in",
    "what follows we first review the mathematical model of aharonov and reznik and point out its limitations .",
    "we then introduce an alternative model in which the energy of an isolated system can be measured by an internal observer arbitrarily fast in his internal time .",
    "finally we discuss its interpretation .",
    "aharonov and reznik consider an isolated system containing a clock .",
    "the system is described ( in the terminology of @xcite ) by the hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian of the internal clock variable @xmath25 ( @xmath26=i$ ] ) and @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the rest of the isolated system . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath27 to be independent of @xmath25 , but the analysis can be easily generalized to the case where it depends on @xmath25 .",
    "in addition the isolated system contains a measurement variable @xmath28 with conjugate momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the outcome of the measurement will be recorded in the value of @xmath29 .",
    "the measurement only takes place for @xmath30 .",
    "thus for @xmath31 or @xmath32 the measuring device is uncoupled to the system and the total hamiltonian is @xmath23 ( we take for simplicity the free hamiltonian of the measuring device to be zero ) whereas between @xmath33 the measuring device is coupled to the system .",
    "aharonov and reznik take the coupling to be a von - neumann type interaction@xcite of the form the standard von neumann interaction hamiltonian is @xmath34 where @xmath7 is the time variable , ie . a classical parameter . in our case",
    "however the role of time is played by the clock pointer @xmath25 , so that @xmath35 . furthermore in our case @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 does not commute with @xmath38 the interaction hamiltonian has to be symmetrised : @xmath39 .",
    "] : @xmath40 here @xmath37 is the coupling function which is non zero only when @xmath41 .",
    "we take @xmath37 to increase rapidly from zero to @xmath42 when the measurement starts , then to stay constant during the measurement , and to decrease rapidly to zero when the measurement ends , see fig .",
    "the duration of the measurement , as measured by the @xmath25 variable , will be denoted @xmath43 .",
    "let us suppose the system is in an eigenstate of the total energy @xmath44 that the box is in an eigenstate of @xmath27 @xmath45 and that the measuring device is in an eigenstate of the measurement variable @xmath28 .",
    "then the state of the isolated system can be written as @xmath46 substituting into eq .",
    "( [ har ] ) one obtains the exact solution : @xmath47    the internal time is @xmath48 since this is the variable that multiplies @xmath49 . indeed",
    "if one realizes a superposition of different states with different @xmath49 , then the internal state of the box will evolve in time @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand the external time , expressed as function of the variables of the isolate system , is @xmath51 since this is the variable that multiplies the total energy @xmath52 . indeed",
    "if one realizes a superposition of states with different values of @xmath52 , then one will find that @xmath53 ( where the wavefunction is solution of @xmath54 , ie .",
    "@xmath7 is the absolute external time which can be measured to arbitrary high precision by an external observer with sufficient energy ) .    in order to analyze the solution eq .",
    "( [ psiar ] ) aharonov and reznik suppose that @xmath55 and then expand the phase in eq .",
    "( [ psiar ] ) to first order in @xmath56 .",
    "note that when @xmath57 , the external time and the internal time coincide @xmath58 and the two need no longer be distinguished . as we shall see in section [ iii ]",
    "these times need not necessarily coincide .",
    "one of the points of the following discussion is to show that the first order expansion of aharonov and reznik is not always legitimate . to illustrate this we shall keep the second order terms in the phase .",
    "thus we approximate eq .",
    "( [ psiar ] ) as @xmath59 after the measurement , ie .",
    "when @xmath60 , and using the fact that @xmath61 ( see the form of @xmath37 in fig .",
    "1 ) we have @xmath62 let us now suppose that initially the measuring device is in a gaussian state @xmath63 centered on @xmath64 with width @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the normalization constant ) .",
    "then at late times the state becomes @xmath67    \\label{psiar4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have rewritten the state in momentum representation .",
    "thus we see that the mean value of @xmath29 has been displaced by @xmath68 this means that a measurement of the total energy of the isolated system has indeed taken place and that its value is registered in the pointer @xmath29 .",
    "the spread in the value of @xmath29 is given by eq.([psiar4 ] ) : @xmath69 the precision @xmath70 with which the energy is measure is thus @xmath71    in discussing the precision of the measurement we must thus distinguish two cases according to the values of @xmath52 .",
    "1 .   @xmath72 . in this case @xmath73 .",
    "we recall that @xmath74 ( this is the condition for the expansion in @xmath75 in the phase to be valid ) and that @xmath76 is the duration of the measurement ( we do not distinguish between internal and external time since when @xmath77 they coincide ) to obtain @xmath78 note that one can come close to saturating this relation when @xmath79 is not very small compared to @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 . in this case",
    "it is the second term under the square root in eq .",
    "( [ precar ] ) which dominates and one can not even come close to saturating eq .",
    "( [ ineqar ] ) .",
    "in fact when @xmath82 increases one is further and further from saturating eq .",
    "( [ ineqar ] ) .",
    "several remarks are now in order .",
    "first of all the parameters @xmath83 can be chosen by the internal observer .",
    "but once they are chosen they are fixed .",
    "this means that there will be only a finite band of energy for which eq .",
    "( [ ineqar ] ) can be approximately saturated .",
    "as the energies get further and further from this band one is further and further from saturating this inequality .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ ineqar ] ) does not have a fundamental character in the context of the model of @xcite .",
    "second the initial state chosen above @xmath84 implies that the resolution of the measurement is maximal near @xmath85 . by putting a phase on",
    "the initial state one can change the energy at which the which the resolution comes close to saturating eq .",
    "( [ ineqar ] ) .",
    "but it will always be optimal in an energy band only .",
    "third in the above calculation we took a gaussian initial state and expanded the phase to second order so as to be able to do an exact calculation . it is not difficult to persuade oneself -for instance by using an analogy with the effect of dispersion on propagating waves- that the general conclusion , namely that the time energy uncertainty relation eq .",
    "( [ ineqar ] ) can only be saturated in an energy band , continues to hold for arbitrary states and when the phase is expanded to higher orders in @xmath86 .    in summary",
    "there are two problems with the conclusions of @xcite concerning the time energy uncertainty .",
    "first of all it is only a model , and one should not draw universal conclusions about the validity of the time - energy uncertainty from a single model . secondly in this model",
    "the time - energy uncertainty , although it is obeyed , does not appear as fundamental since for most values of the energy is can not be saturated .",
    "we now introduce an alternative model that allows an internal observer to carry out measurements of the total energy arbitrarily fast in his own internal time .",
    "the hamiltonian of the box , the clock and the measuring device is : @xmath87 where the notation is the same as in section [ ii ] , eq .",
    "( [ har ] ) .    note",
    "that this hamiltonian can be thought of as describing the isolated system undergoing gravitational collapse as discussed in the introduction .",
    "indeed the hamiltonian of such a collapsing planet would be @xmath88 .",
    "our model thus corresponds to taking the metric to be @xmath89 .",
    "note that this metric is an operator ( since @xmath28 and @xmath25 are operators ) .",
    "this will play a crucial role in what follows .",
    "the exact solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath90 where the notation is once more as in section [ ii ] , eq .",
    "( [ psiar ] ) .    in the present case",
    "the internal time is @xmath91 and the external time , expressed as function of the variables of the isolate system , is @xmath92 since these are the functions that multiply @xmath49 and @xmath52 respectively in the phase of @xmath93 .",
    "note that before and after the measurement @xmath94 and the internal and external time coincide .",
    "but we will allow them to be very different during the measurement .",
    "after the measurement , when @xmath95 , the solution takes the form ( where we use the form of @xmath37 given in fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath96 thus after the measurement the momentum @xmath29 of the measuring device has been displaced by @xmath97 note that no approximations have been made in obtaining this result , contrary to the the way eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) is obtained in the model of aharonov and reznik . if the momentum of the measuring device has spread @xmath98 , then eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) constitutes a measurement of total energy with precision @xmath99    in order to interpret eq .",
    "( [ demp ] ) we must specify the initial state of the measuring device .",
    "we will take the initial state to only have values @xmath100 .",
    "this ensures ( since @xmath101 ) that the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hmp ] ) never becomes infinite and that the model is well defined .",
    "we will thus suppose that the initial state is centered on @xmath102 with width @xmath103 such that @xmath104 .",
    "note that these constraints are compatible with taking the initial state to be almost gaussian and thus to almost saturate the inequality @xmath105 .",
    "the constraint on the precision of the measurement can be rewritten as @xmath106 and this inequality can be almost saturated in the case of the quasi gaussian states just mentioned .    the amount of internal time it takes to carry out the measurement is @xmath107 .",
    "we can choose @xmath108 arbitrarily small .",
    "we can also choose @xmath42 such that @xmath109 is arbitrarily large .",
    "thus the internal observer can measure the total energy of the system to arbitrarily high precision in arbitrarily small internal time .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "now we come to an interesting point , namely how the external time variable @xmath10 is related to the internal time variable @xmath11 and how the duration of the measurement , as measured by the two observers , are related .",
    "let us imagine that before the measurement starts both clocks are synchronized and that the measurement starts at @xmath110 as indicated by both clocks .",
    "as soon as the measurement is finished , the internal observer sends a signal to the external observer . what will be the time @xmath15 indicated by the external clock ?    to answer this question we use eqs .",
    "( [ tintx ] ) and ( [ textx ] ) to find @xmath111 @xmath13 is well defined .",
    "however @xmath28 is an operator and has uncertainty",
    ". therefore @xmath15 is uncertain .",
    "this raises two questions : what is its average value @xmath112 and what is its spread @xmath113 ?",
    "the uncertainty is given by @xmath114 .",
    "the constraint eq .",
    "( [ demp2 ] ) can thus be interpreted as a relation between the precision of the measurement and the uncertainty in the duration of the measurement as measured in external time : @xmath115 we will argue below that this constraint is universal and must apply to all measurements of total energy by an internal observer .",
    "the average duration of the measurement is @xmath116 . since in our model",
    "@xmath117 the average duration of the measurement , as measured in external time , is constrained by @xmath118 however as discussed below we are not sure whether this constraint is universal .",
    "we now address the universality of eqs .",
    "( [ dedtmp ] ) and ( [ detmp ] ) . to this end",
    "let us view the _ total _ system consisting of the internal _ and _ the external system as a whole .",
    "let us suppose that the total system is in an energy eigenstate .",
    "let us also suppose that initially the internal and external times are correlated ( this is possible since @xmath119 commutes with the total energy @xmath120 ) .",
    "then the internal measurement of the internal energy can also be viewed as saying that the internal observer is measuring the energy of the _ external _ system .",
    "but we know that when an external observer measures the energy of a system the internal clock gets randomized ( since the energy of the system and the clock variable are conjugate operators in the usual sense ) . now in the previous example the internal observer can be considered `` external '' to the original external system which now becomes the `` internal '' system .",
    "hence the original internal observer s measurement must randomize the original external time . thus eq .",
    "( [ dedtmp ] ) must always hold .",
    "does this imply that eq .",
    "( [ detmp ] ) is also universal ? at first sight one would think so .",
    "but so far we have been unable to find a proof .",
    "( for instance it seems logically possible -although unlikely- that one could devise a model in which the measurement almost always takes a very short external time , and very rarely takes a very long external time , in such a way that the average duration of the measurement is arbitrarily short , but the spread in the durations obeys eq .",
    "( [ dedtmp ] ) .",
    "such a model would not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ detmp ] ) ) .",
    "we thus leave the universal validity of eq .",
    "( [ detmp ] ) as a conjecture .",
    "we have shown that it is possible for an internal observer to measure the total energy of an isolated system in arbitrary short internal time .",
    "this was done in a particular model .",
    "an interesting question is whether one can make the model more realistic , for instance by basing it on the model of gravitational collapse discussed in the introduction . in this respect one problem",
    "pointed out to us by y. aharonov@xcite is that in our model the hamiltonian is not bounded from below .",
    "we are not sure to what extent taking a positive hamiltonian will modify our conclusions .",
