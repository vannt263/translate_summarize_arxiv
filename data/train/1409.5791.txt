    "long gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are intense , relativistically beamed , bursts of radiation , likely emitted during the collapse of a massive star at the end of its life @xcite . as well as constraining the end stages of the evolution for massive stars , they also mark out star formation in the distant universe , in galaxies often too small to observe directly through their stellar emission or molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one of the most recent studies , which exploited alma data , identified the host of grb980425 as a dwarf system with low dust content and suggested that this is typical of grb hosts as a whole .",

    "contours are shown at 1 , 2 and 3@xmath30 confidence levels .",
    "[ fig : sersic2 ] ]    while we are unable to distinguish clumpiness on sub - kiloparsec scales , the host galaxy is sufficiently resolved in this new imaging to place constraints on its radial light profile , although such constraints are necessarily limited by the relatively large ( 0.253 arcsecond ) pixels relative to the seeing . in figures [ fig : sersic ] and [ fig : sersic2 ] we compare the radially averaged light profile of the galaxy with sersic profiles ( see * ? ? ? * for definitions and discussion ) , which have been convolved with the seeing in the image .",
    "it is clear that a de vaucouleurs law ( @xmath42 ) , such as describes local giant elliptical galaxies would predict far too steep a light profile .",
    "allowing the effective radius and sersic parameter to vary simultaneously , the best fit to the data is found for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we also obtained spectroscopic data from acam on the same night , using the v400 grating and a total integration time of @xmath45s , producing a spectrum spanning 4000 - 9000  with a spectral resolution measured from unblended arc lines of @xmath2918(@xmath291000kms@xmath6 ) .",

    "both the grb host galaxy and its neighbour are detected at high signal to noise in our spectroscopy .",
    "the latter clearly shows two components , a and b. of these , component a is the stronger continuum source , while component b appears to show relatively stronger line emission ( see figure [ fig:2dspec ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab : lines ] we provide the relative emission line strengths of each source ( also shown graphically in figure [ fig : specall ] ) .",
    "line equivalent widths are presented in the observed frame .",
    "we make no adjustment for slit losses since it is difficult to reconstruct precisely where on the object the 1.5 arcsec wide slit was placed , and harder still to estimate whether line ratios in the regions of the galaxy outside the slit are comparable to those in observed regions .",
    "the measured redshift for the host galaxy is @xmath0 and for the neighbour @xmath48 ( for both components ) .",
    "the uncertainty , estimated by cross correlation against a template starburst spectrum , comprises instrumental resolution effects , the effects of blending on many of the lines and uncertainty due to small shifts in velocity offset between different emission lines .",
    "while we adopt the cross - correlation redshifts and conservative associated uncertainties for our analysis , we also consider the redshift derived from the observed wavelength of individual emission lines .",
    "fitting gaussian profiles to the unblended h@xmath49 and [ oiii ] and the strong , but somewhat blended h@xmath50 lines , we derive redshifts @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the grb host and components a and b of the companion respectively , where the error now represents the scatter between individual line centroids on each source rather than including other uncertainties .",
    "these imply velocity offsets of @xmath54kms@xmath6 ( i.e. no significant offset ) between the two components of the companion and @xmath55kms@xmath6 between the host and the companion .",
    "this velocity offset places the galaxy pair just outside ( although within one standard deviation of ) the criteria used to select galaxy pairs in the sdss by @xcite , who placed a cutoff for their sample at @xmath56kms@xmath6 .",

    "@xcite identified an enhancement in star formation rate for pairs with projected separations @xmath58kpc , a criterion easily satisifed by the companion in this case ( 16@xmath59 represents @xmath60kpc at this redshift ) , suggesting that the star formation observed in both host and companion is likely influenced by their proximity .    in figures [ fig : specha ] and [ fig : spechb ] , we present the spectral regions in the grb host galaxy associated with line ratios used to classify an ionising spectrum ( see section [ sec : disc ] ) . at this spectral resolution , h@xmath61 is blended with the [ nii ] doublet , and a fit to the three lines must be obtained simultaneously in order to measure their line strengths . with the exception of close doublets ( i.e. [ oii ] , [ sii ] ) the other lines in the spectrum are all comparitively unblended , and all lines are consistent with being essentially unresolved at the instrumental resolution .",

    "measurement of weak lines is not attempted in the fainter neighbour , and it is impossible to isolate the two components in the [ oii ] line.[tab : lines ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the host of grb080517 appears to be a compact , smooth galaxy in the local universe . given its uv - optical photometry , there would be little reason to expect significant ongoing star formation . nonetheless ,",
    "as the previous section describes , there is substantial evidence for an ongoing , young and fairly dusty ( based on h@xmath50/h@xmath49 ) starburst , which likely dominates emission at @xmath62 m .    in this context , the presence of a near neighbour ( separated by only @xmath2925kpc at @xmath13 ) is intriguing .",
    "the two galaxies have comparable masses ( the neighbour is just @xmath290.5 magnitudes fainter than the grb host and similar in colour ) , and any interaction between them will constitute a major incident in the history of both galaxies .",
    "the gravitational forces caused by a near fly - by in the recent past could well have been sufficient to trigger the starburst detected in both sources - a starburst somewhat obscured by dust .",
    "it is also notable that the cores of both galaxies ( including both components of the neighbour ) and the grb x - ray error circle lie along a common axis .",
    "further modelling of the dynamics of this system , supported by integral field spectroscopy , and a search for low surface - brightness distortions in the morphology of both galaxies , will be necessary to confirm this picture , but the existing evidence is suggestive .",
    "long - duration grbs are typically associated with the peak light in their host galaxies , and with recent star formation ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the broadband continuum emission of the host of grb080517 is dominated by a much older stellar population . if , then , we hypothesise that the grb is associated with the recent episode of star formation in this system , we are left with the conclusion that it occured in a dusty region ( e(@xmath63)=1.2 ) undergoing an intense star burst ( sfr@xmath2916m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "such dust extinction is consistent with the excess neutral hydrogen column inferred from the x - ray afterglow , and potentially with the failure of early - time optical observations to identify an optical transient distinguishable from the host galaxy .    as we have already discussed , it is impossible to determine whether grb080517 would indeed have met the ` dark ' burst criterion if deeper observations were available",
    ". it is , however , possible to consider whether its host lies in a similar region of parameter space to known dark bursts .",
    "@xcite recently presented a systematic analysis of the dark grb host galaxy population , examining both their afterglow properties and those derived from fitting of the host galaxy spectral energy distribution .",
    "as figures [ fig : perley1 ] and [ fig : perley2 ] demonstrate , the inferred characteristics of the host of grb080517 lie comfortably within the distribution of ` dark ' burst hosts in terms of afterglow spectral index , hydrogen column density , stellar mass and inferred star formation rate , although the last is higher than those in dark bursts at @xmath64 , and more akin to those observed at higher redshifts @xcite .    ]     line emission , compared to those of ` dark ' bursts as given by @xcite .",
    "grb080517 ( bold , red symbol ) has an inferred stellar mass ( based on sed fitting ) comparable to those of the dark burst population , and follows the same mass - star formation rate trend.[fig : perley2 ] ]    whether or not grb080517 is indeed a local example of a ` dark ' host , one advantage it offers is the opportunity to study its optical spectrum in a detail challenging for higher redshift grb hosts of either dark or normal types .    in figures [ fig : bpt ] and",
    "[ fig : metal ] we compare its optical emission line ratios to those of local emission - line galaxies from the sdss @xcite .",
    "the grb host has line ratios consistent with a solar or slightly super - solar metallicity , and is within the range of scatter of the sdss sample , although well above the relationship between the r@xmath65 and [ o iii]/[oii ] at a given metallicity determined by .",
    "this is consistent with the results from the less metal - sensitive sed fitting procedure described in section [ sec : sed ] , in which 0.5 - 1.0 solar metallicity templates were narrowly preferred over those with significantly lower metal enrichment . while far from unique , this places the host of grb080517 towards the upper end of the metallicity distribution for grb hosts . interestingly , at least two other high metallicity bursts , grb020819 @xcite and grb080607 @xcite , are dark bursts .    the bpt diagram @xcite is an established indicator of starburst versus agn character , since the different ionisation parameters arising from the two classes have a strong effect on optical emission line ratios and particularly the ratio of [ nii ] to h@xmath50 .",
    "as figure [ fig : bpt ] demonstrates , the two components of the neighbouring source are broadly consistent with a star - formation driven spectrum , although both lie above the local mean in [ oiii]/h@xmath49 ( a trait also often seen in high redshift star forming galaxies , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while component a has measured line ratios consistent with a ` composite ' spectrum , large errors on the measured values permit a purely star forming spectrum .",
    "the line ratios of the grb host galaxy are intriguing , placing it too in the region of the parameter space usually described as ` composite ' , suggesting that there might plausibly be a contribution to the ionising spectrum from an agn .",
    "if so , this would be a surprise , since gamma ray bursts have not previously been associated with active galaxies , but may help to explain the excess flux seen in the @xmath66 m band where a hot agn would be expected to make a contribution to pah emission .",
    "unfortunately _ swift _ did not track the burst beyond 20 hours after the trigger , at which point the x - ray afterglow was still fading .",
    "however the measured flux at this late epoch provides a firm upper limit on possible x - ray flux from the host galaxy of 4.3@xmath67ergs@xmath68s@xmath6 in the _ swift _ xrt 0.3 - 10kev band .",
    "the luminosity of any hypothetical agn at @xmath13 is therefore constrained to an @xmath69ergss@xmath6 , placing it at the very low end of the agn luminosity distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted in section [ sec : afterglow ] , there is also little evidence for any optical variability in the host galaxy , either before or after the gamma ray burst , as might be expected of a galaxy with a strong agn contibution .    while the centre of the host galaxy lies outside the 90% confidence interval on the x - ray location of the grb ( based on the refined xrt analysis ) , the two locations are consistent at the 2@xmath30 uncertainty level .",
    "it is therefore not impossible that the gamma - ray burst resulted from activity in the galactic nucleus .    a rare class of gamma ray flares",
    "are known to result from a sudden accretion event due to the tidal disruption of stars around supermassive black holes ( * ? ? ?",

    "the burst of accretion in such sources launches a relativistic jet , and would result in a short - lived burst of agn activity from otherwise quiescent galactic nuclei . in this context , the plausible association of grb080517 with a very low luminosity agn at @xmath296 years post burst merits further investigation and monitoring of this system .",
    "further observations will be required to place firmer constraints on the presence or absence of an agn at late times and any late time variability .",
    "we note that if there is no agn contribution , then the optical emission line ratios in the host imply star formation with a steep ultraviolet spectrum , causing a higher ionisation parameter than is typical at low redshifts , and perhaps strengthening the suggestion that this is a very young , intense starburst ( as suggested by the bpass stellar population models ) .    ]",

    "grb080517 is a rare , low luminosity , long gamma ray burst .",
    "our wht spectroscopy reveals that the host galaxy of grb080517 is a strong optical line emitter lying at @xmath13 .",
    "3 .   the morphology of the grb host appears to be smooth and compact with a half light radius , deconvolved with the seeing , of 2.7kpc .",
    "its light distribution is consistent with a sersic index of n=@xmath70 .",
    "the strong optical emission line ratios in the grb host are consistent with a composite agn+starburst spectrum at solar or super - solar metallicity , and the ratio of balmer lines suggests the nebular emission is subject to an extinction e(@xmath63)=1.2 .",
    "5 .   the spectral energy distribution of the galaxy in the uv - optical is broadly reproduced by a post - starburst template at an age of 500myr , with a relatively small component of ongoing star formation ( @xmath711% of the stellar mass ) .",
    "however no template considered provides a good match to all features of the sed , and in particular to the high fluxes measued at @xmath62 m , suggesting that multiple components with different spectral energy distributions may contribute to the broadband flux .",
    "star formation rate estimates for the grb host range from 0.43m@xmath5yr@xmath6 to 16.5m@xmath5yr@xmath6 , based on different indicators .",
    "the low rate estimated from the ultraviolet continuum likely arises due to strong dust extinction in the star forming regions .",
    "estimates from the h@xmath50 line and @xmath66 m are consistent at 15.5@xmath20.4 and 16.5@xmath21.5m@xmath5yr@xmath6 7 .",
    "we detect radio emission from the host galaxy with a flux density , @xmath720.22@xmath20.04mjy .",
    "this corresponds to a star formation rate of 7.6@xmath21.4m@xmath5yr@xmath6 .",
    "the high ionisation parameter seen in the optical line ratios , low radio flux and sed fitting are all consistent with a very young ( @xmath71100myr ) star formation episode .",
    "the host galaxy has a close companion within 25kpc in projected distance and lying at the same redshift .",
    "the companion shows distorted morphology , including two cores which appear to be undergoing a merger .",
    "the proximity of these galaxies may indicate that the grb progenitor formed in an ongoing starburst triggered by gravitational interaction",
    ". 10 . while the burst afterglow was too faint to tightly constrain the x - ray to optical flux ratio , its properties and those of its host galaxy are consistent with those of the ` dark ' grb population .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the photometry and spectroscopy of the host galaxy of _ swift_-detected grb080517 . from our optical spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we identify a redshift of @xmath0 , based on strong emission lines , making this a rare example of a very local , low luminosity , long gamma ray burst . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy is detected in the radio with a flux density of @xmath10.22@xmath20.04mjy - one of relatively few known grb hosts with a securely measured radio flux . </S>",
    "<S> both optical emission lines and a strong detection at 22@xmath3 m suggest that the host galaxy is forming stars rapidly , with an inferred star formation rate @xmath4m@xmath5yr@xmath6 and a high dust obscuration ( e@xmath7 , based on sight - lines to the nebular emission regions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a companion galaxy within a projected distance of 25kpc , and almost identical in redshift , suggests that star formation may have been triggered by galaxy - galaxy interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , fitting of the remarkably flat spectral energy distribution from the ultraviolet through to the infrared suggests that an older , 500myr post - starburst stellar population is present along with the ongoing star formation . we conclude that the host galaxy of grb080517 is a valuable addition to the still very small sample of well - studied local gamma - ray burst hosts .    </S>",
