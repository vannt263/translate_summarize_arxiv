    "a mathematical fractal is a self - similar object on all possible spatial and time scales .",
    "it means that when we proceed from large to smaller scales , we will see exactly the same picture . from mathematical standpoint",
    "this means that a unique scaling law holds for all scales .",
    "a fractal ( or , more rigorously , a mono - fractal ) is a deterministic , predictable system .",
    "mathematical mono - fractals differ drastically from what we observe in nature : fractal - like structures in nature are _ multi - fractals _ - a superposition of infinite number of mono - fractals .",
    "the transition from mono - fractals to multi - fractals turns an amusing mathematical toy into a powerful tool to study real processes in nature .",
    "the matter is that multi - fractals posses the same properties in both the spatial and temporal domains .",
    "this means that if we see a very complex , jagged shape in space ( multi - fractal in space ) , then we will observe a violent , burst - like behavior in time ( multi - fractal in time ) . for such systems ,",
    "any small perturbation can cause an avalanche of any possible size .",
    "therefore , revealing the fact that a system under study is a fractal does not allow us to make inferences about its nature and essential properties of its behavior .",
    "we need something more , namely , to know of how many mono - fractals our system is made of .",
    "numerous examples of fractals and multi - fractals can be found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* internet ) .",
    "mathematical details of the fractal calculus are well described as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "historically , when analyzing spatial objects , their capability to be organized into very jagged structures with extended voids and sharp peaks is addressed as a property of multi - fractality . at the sate time , while analyzing time series , we address the same property as intermittency .",
    "thus , multi - fractality and intermittency are two terms for the same physical property of a system .",
    "i will use both of them in this talk .",
    "several approaches were elaborated during a couple of last decades to probe the properties of multi - fractality in different fields of science . in a brief review",
    "below , i will focus on multi - fractality techniques applied in astrophysics .",
    "thus , multi - fractal systems are capable of self - organization ( i.e. , formation of larger entities from smaller ones via inverse cascade ) , and of self - organized criticality ( soc ) when burst - like energy release events of any scale are possible at any moment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a theory of catastrophes is also based on the multi - fractal nature of astrophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "percolating clusters @xcite are also fractals and multi - fractals .",
    "direct calculations of fractal dimensions and spectra of multi - fractality is one of the most popular tool to explore astrophysical multi - fractals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility to study multi - fractality is to analyze high statistical moments by means of distribution functions @xcite , or structure functions @xcite .",
    "* essential physical properties of multi - fractals * can be formulated as follows .",
    "\\(i ) scaling laws change with scale , i.e. , no unique power law index can be valid for all scales ;    \\(ii ) large fluctuations ( in both time and space domains ) are not rare and contribute significantly to high statistical moments , which grow as the data set expands ;    \\(iii ) direct and inverse cascades along scales are possible ( fragmentation and aggregation ) , which results in capability to form larger features from smaller ones , i.e. , self - organization and soc state .",
    "these properties can help us to diagnose the presence and degree of multi - fractality of various astrophysical phenomena .",
    "meanwhile , keeping in mind that in astrophysical magnetism we deal with a specific type of a multi - fractal medium , namely , _",
    "intermittent turbulence in an electro - conductive flow _",
    ", we can take advantage of it and incorporate other very important properties and tools .",
    "so our list of properties can be extended :    \\(iv ) intermittent turbulent magnetized plasma is capable of amplifying a seed magnetic field , i.e. , local fast dynamo is at work @xcite , see also a recent review by @xcite ;    \\(v ) turbulent plasma at high reynolds number displays properties of multi - fractality and intermittency in spatial / temporal structures of temperatures , velocities , density , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ;    \\(vi ) the regime of diffusivity on multi - fractals is expected to be an anomalous diffusion .",
    "based on these properties of multi - fractal systems , i will discuss below how exploration of these properties can help us in understanding of solar and stellar magnetism .",
    "it is impossible in the framework of this invited talk to discuss all aforementioned approaches and tools in great details , so i will concentrate on the analysis of structure functions , which are used in my research .",
    "since kolmogorov s study @xcite , various models have been proposed to describe the statistical behavior of fully developed turbulence . in these studies ,",
    "the flow is modeled using statistically averaged quantities , and structure functions play a significant role .",
    "they are defined as statistical moments of the @xmath0powers of the increment of a field .",
    "the definition can be applied to different fields ( e.g. , velocity , temperature , magnetic field , etc ) . here ,",
    "in the most of the cases , i will refer to the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field , @xmath1 , for which the structure function can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current pixel on a magnetogram , @xmath4 is the separation vector between any two points used to measure the increment ( see the lower right panel in figure [ fig1 ] , and @xmath5 is the order of a statistical moment , which takes on real values .",
    "the angular brackets denote averaging over the magnetogram , and the vector @xmath6 is allowed to adopt all possible orientations , @xmath7 , on the magnetogram .",
    "the next step is to calculate the scaling of the structure functions , which is defined as the slope , @xmath8 , measured inside some range of scales where the @xmath9-function is linear and the field is intermittent .",
    "the function @xmath8 is shown in the upper right panel in figure [ fig1 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     recall that for normal diffusion ( brownian motions ) , the squared displacements of tracers are directly proportional to time , i.e. , the power law index , @xmath10 , of the displacement spectrum is a unity ( an example of the normal diffusion regime is illustrated in figure [ fig6 ] with thick black dashed lines ) . when @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , a regime of super - diffusion ( sub - diffusion ) dominates .",
    "the squared displacements @xmath13 can be approximated , at a given range of scales , as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath10 and @xmath16 are derived from the best linear lit to the data points plotted in a double - logarithmic plot .",
    "then the diffusion coefficient can be written as @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18    as if follows from figure [ fig6 ] , for both data sets we observe the super - diffusion regime . the coefficient of magnetic turbulent diffusivity , @xmath19 , derived by eq .",
    "( [ k_l ] ) for both data sets is shown in figure [ fig6]_b_. two essential things should be mentioned here : first , the diffusion coefficient grows as the scale increases ( the same is true for a time scale , too , see eq .",
    "( [ ktau ] ) .",
    "second , the slope of the power law varies with scale ( which is a characteristic feature of intrinsic multi - fractality ) . on the minimal spatial ( 25 km ) and temporal ( 10 sec ) scales considered in @xcite , the diffusion coefficient in qs area was found to be 19  km@xmath20  s@xmath21 .",
    "the hmi data provided a value of approximately 220  km@xmath20  s@xmath21 on the largest available scale of 4 mm .",
    "the observed tendency of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity to decrease with decreasing scales leads us to expect that the turbulent diffusivity might be close to the magnitudes of diffusivity adopted in the numerical simulations of small - scale dynamo ( 0.01 - 10 km@xmath22s@xmath21 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the simulations even more realistic .    in summary ,",
    "a super - diffusion regime on very small scales is very favorable for pictures assuming turbulent dynamo action since it assumes decreasing diffusivity with decreasing scales .",
    "continuously varying magnetic fields are the main reason for the solar / stellar activity .",
    "the 11-year solar cycle is one of the most astonishing and widely known examples of the self - organized generation of the magnetic field .",
    "although we know that there is no two absolutely similar solar cycles , yet , persistency and regularity of the solar periodicity through thousands of years remains impressive .",
    "a drastically different picture arises when one looks on the photosphere : chaos of mixed - polarity magnetic elements of all sizes until the resolution limits of modern instruments , continuously renewing during 1 - 2 days - the magnetic carpet .",
    "dualism of the solar magnetism is usually explained by a simultaneous action of two dynamos : a global dynamo operating in the convective zone and responsible for the 11-year solar cycle , and local , or turbulent dynamo , which might operate inside the near - surface layer and to be responsible for generation of small - scale magnetic fields forming the magnetic carpet .",
    "the explanation seems to oversimplify the reality because resent studies of distribution of the magnetic flux accumulated in magnetic flux tubes showed the non - interrupted power law for many decades @xcite thus supposing a common ( for all scales ) mechanism for the magnetic field generation .",
    "one of promising ways to handle the problem is to consider the solar dynamo process as a non - linear dynamical system ( nds ) , with intrinsic properties of multi - fractality and intermittency .    like any nds , the solar dynamo is then capable to self - organization on all scales ( including large scales ) and display a chaotic nature on small scales .",
    "self - organization , in turn , provides for a magnetic complex a way to reach a soc state , when burst - like energy release events of any size are possible at any time instant .",
    "the concept is very important for our understanding of flaring and heating processes in solar / stellar atmospheres .",
    "further , multi - fractal nature on the magnetic field provides a necessary condition for the local turbulent dynamo operation in the near - surface layer of the convective zone .",
    "observational evidences for local dynamo operation are still under strong debates , e.g. , compare the talks by drs .",
    "tsuneta and stenflo presented at this symposium .",
    "one pragmatic advise for researchers could be inferred form the observed multi - fractal nature of magnetized solar plasma . namely , observed power laws should not be extrapolated over neighboring scales , a frequent mistake for power laws studies in various fields ."
