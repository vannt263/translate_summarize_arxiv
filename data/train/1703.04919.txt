    "_ granular materials _ are one of the most significant and simple forms of matter  @xcite .",
    "a granular system consists of a large number of mesoscopic particles of regular and irregular shapes with smooth or rough surfaces .",
    "the typical size of a particle in a granular system ranges from few @xmath6 to few @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "these particles loss their kinetic energy due inelasticity and friction , when they collide and slide past each other , and makes a granular system different from ordinary liquids or gases , where it is assumed that energy remains conserved during the collisions between the atoms and molecules .",
    "also , the typical scale of the energy of a granular system is much higher than the thermal energy , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "thus , granular systems are athermal in nature , and temperature has no role in the dynamics of granular particles . due to dissipation and athermal nature ,",
    "a granular system shows distinct properties from usual solids , liquids , and gases  @xcite .",
    "for example , a sand pile at rest with a slope less than the angle of repose produces solid like behavior due to static friction . also , the flow of dry sand through the narrow neck of a sand clock is an example of liquid - like behavior .",
    "low - density granular gases appear in sand storm , dust , and smoke etc .",
    "the flow of granular matters is important from the industrial application point of view .",
    "for example , pharmaceutical industries rely on the processing of powder and pills . in agricultural industries and food processing industries , seeds , grains , and food stuff",
    "are transported and manipulated .",
    "understanding the dynamics of granular matters has importance in studying the early stage evolution of stars , galaxies , and astrophysical dust  @xcite .",
    "recently , brilliantov _ et al .",
    "_ described the size distribution of particles in saturn s ring using the concept of granular aggregation and fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the problem of granular gases has been extensively studied in past two decades  @xcite . in the leading theoretical approach ,",
    "a granular gas is modeled by a system of inelastic hard spheres , where the collision between a pair of spheres is characterized by a constant coefficient of restitution less than unity  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting problem studied within that approach is cooling and pattern formation in density and velocity fields .",
    "particles in the system loss their kinetic energy due to the inelastic binary collisions . in the early stage of evolution , velocity remains random and density remains uniform .",
    "however , system cools due to inelastic collisions , is known as homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) .",
    "haff s law describes the decay of kinetic energy in hcs  @xcite .",
    "however , later in time , the density field becomes unstable to fluctuations and the system enters an inhomogeneous cooling state ( ics ) , where the particle - rich clusters are formed and grow .",
    "temperature of the system shows algebraic decay .",
    "non - unified results are reported in literature for velocity distribution in the ics , e.g. , power laws , stretched exponential , etc .",
    ", have been reported in various studies  @xcite .",
    "_ studied the complex pattern formation dynamics of density and velocity fields by invoking analogies from studies of phase ordering dynamics .",
    "the growth kinetics of the clusters in density and velocity fields have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "recently , schwartz _ et al .",
    "_ presented detailed study of pattern formation in two dimensional granular gases where energy dissipation is modeled by solid friction  @xcite .    in the case of dense flows ,",
    "many particles interact among each other simultaneously and stay in prolonged contact .",
    "thus , the concept of collision is not meaningful in this case . in case of granular gases cooling by inelastic collisions",
    ", it is known that evolution of the density , velocity , and granular temperature fields is well described by the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "however , finding a macroscopic continuous description of such dense granular systems has been an important and challenging issue in the physics of granular flows . in this paper",
    ", we consider the solid friction as the only dissipation mechanism in granular gases .",
    "although we believe that frictional dissipation plays significant role in dense systems , we apply it here to gaseous granular matter , as the only mechanism of mechanical energy dissipation , to study its effect on the cooling properties of such dilute systems . also , we present results for the phase ordering velocity fields and the corresponding growth dynamics .",
    "this work will serve also as a reference point for future work on denser systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we describe details of our molecular dynamics simulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present detailed numerical results . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we conclude with a brief summary and discussion .",
    "in our molecular dynamics model simulation , we consider a system of particles confined in a cubic box of size @xmath9 .",
    "particles are spherical in shape , identical in size , and of equal mass @xmath10 .",
    "any two particles with position vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 interact with via a two - body potential with a hardcore of diameter @xmath13 and a thin shell repulsive potential . to be specific ,",
    "we consider the following form of interaction potential : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the separation between the two particles , @xmath16 is the amplitude of the potential , has the dimension of potential energy and @xmath17 , is the typical thickness of the thin repulsive shell . here , eq .  ( [ pot ] ) is to be taken only as a model of repulsive potential that rises steeply from zero at the outer boundary of the shell to infinity at the hardcore .",
    "the normal force applied by particle @xmath18 to particle @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where the gradient is taken with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding solid friction force is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the linear velocities of particle @xmath18 and particle @xmath19 respectively .",
    "( [ ff ] ) reduces to well known coulomb s friction force when the thickness of the repulsive shell tends to zero . in this case",
    ", the normal component of relative velocity goes to zero and the frictional force becomes purely tangential to the normal force . for simplicity , we did not consider rotational motion of the grains .",
    "we use the following units for various relevant quantities : lengths are expressed in units of @xmath13 , temperature in @xmath25 and time in @xmath26 . for the sake of convenience and numerical stability , we set @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we implemented the standard velocity verlet algorithm  @xcite to update positions and velocities of md simulations .",
    "the integration time step is @xmath32 .",
    "the granular gas consisted of n = 400000 particles confined in a 3d box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we consider two different friction coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the volume fraction is @xmath35 , which corresponds to number density @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the box size is @xmath37 .",
    "we initialize the system by randomly placing particles in the simulation box , such that there is no overlap between the cores of any two particles .",
    "we assign equal velocity to all the particles but the velocity vector points in random directions so that @xmath38 , i.e. , we fix the centre of mass velocity equal to zero .",
    "the system is allowed to evolve till @xmath39 with @xmath40 , i.e. , the elastic limit .",
    "the system is relaxed to a uniform density state and the velocity follows maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) velocity distribution , which serves as the initial condition ( at @xmath41 ) for our md simulation of inelastic spheres with @xmath42 .",
    "two - dimensional ( x - y plane ) cross section of evolution snapshots of density field at different times , as mentioned .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we show the evolution snapshots of the density field for @xmath33 .",
    "details are given in the figure caption .",
    "at early times , the density remains roughly homogeneous .",
    "however , at later times , the formation of clusters is observed .",
    "this cluster formation can be explained as follows .",
    "consider some fluctuations in the homogeneous phase of the density field .",
    "particles in the high - density regions lose more energy than those in the low - density regions .",
    "thus the effective temperature and hence pressure are lesser in the clustered phase than those in the homogeneous phase .",
    "this gradient of pressure drives particles from low - density to high - density regions , increasing the density fluctuations . at the late stage ,",
    "the system becomes sluggish due to the dissipation of energy .",
    "evolution snapshots of the coarse - grained velocity field in the x - y plane at different times , as mentioned for @xmath46 layer .",
    "the coarse - grained system size is @xmath47 . for the sake of clarity",

    "however , at the late stage , local correlation builds up . due to frictional interaction among the particles , the normal component of relative velocity",
    "is dissipated , and the tangential component of relative velocity remains unaltered causing the local parallelization of velocities of two interacting particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the two dimensional cross - section of the coarse - grained velocity field at different times in the x - y plane .",
    "we divide the system into non - overlapping cubes of size @xmath49 and the average value of velocity is calculated in each cube .",
    "the direction of the average velocity is plotted as an arrow starting at the center of each square , using x- and y- components of the velocity .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity in each cube is represented by a shade of gray scale .",
    "darker the shade of gray smaller is the velocity .",
    "void spaces in the velocity field are the particle free regions of density field .",
    "we studied ordering in velocity field by invoking analogies from phase ordering kinetics with vector order - parameter field  @xcite .",
    "we introduce an order - parameter @xmath50 , which is the normalized average velocity in each cell , i.e. , we only take the direction of average velocity .",
    "this is analogous to the vector order - parameter of dynamical x - y model in three dimensions  @xcite .",
