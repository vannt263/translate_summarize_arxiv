    "it is well known that inflation is a necessary constituent of modern cosmology in order to solve the long standing problems of standard cosmology @xcite as the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , the horizon and flatness problems , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "indeed , inflation is desired to be accomplished by particle physics theories , which should be able to fulfill the cosmological standard tests @xcite , before one can speak about a successfully cosmology .",
    "however , there are some unwanted problems inherent to many of the inflation models like the achievement of the right contrast of density perturbations within a non fine - tuning particle physics model or enough reheat temperature after inflation to yield the particle content of the universe , among others ; in this sense , one can also speak of some `` quasi - long '' standing problems of inflationary models .    in order to understand these issues both of cosmology and particle physics , in recent years",
    "it has been carried out some progress in the experiments , like the observations made by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite @xcite , the possible discovery of the top quark @xcite , among others , as well as some theoretical extensions of the standard model , grand unification theories ( gut ) s and gravity theories , see @xcite .",
    "particularly , the cosmological consequences of induced gravity models are well known @xcite , but the particle physics content is still unclear , simply because the lagrangians used there imply scalar field associated particles with masses greater than the planck mass ( @xmath1 ) . motivated by these requests we have recently studied @xcite an induced gravity model of inflation based on a non - minimal coupling between gravity and the su(5 ) gut higgs field , as an extension to both the minimal su(5 ) gut and einstein s general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "now we study , what is the role played by the induced gravity model with a non - minimal coupling in the standard model of particle physics , motivated by some aspects listed below .",
    "the issue of inflation at the electroweak energy scale has been recently discussed @xcite motived by the possibility that baryogenesis could take place at that scale and also because any net baryon number generated before would be brought to zero by the efficient anomalous electroweak processes , unless the original gut model was b - l conserving @xcite .",
    "moreover , inflation in this energy scale brings other advantages : one does not have to deal with heavy relics or monopoles , which usually appear at gut scales and reheating is more efficient .",
    "one can also expect that the some of physics of this scenario could de tested in particle accelerators in the followings years .",
    "furthermore , recently it has been proposed induced gravity in the standard model could solve some other problems of particle physics and cosmology , like the necessity of the higgs mass to be order of the theory cut off @xcite and to relate directly mach ideas with a particle production mechanism by means of the equivalence principle , as well as , the missing mass problem @xcite .    in this paper , we want to discuss some early universe consequences of a theory of gravity coupled to the isovectorial higgs field of the standard model , which is proved to produce a type of yukawa gravitational interaction @xcite , and which breaks down to give rise to both some boson and fermion masses and the newton s constant .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] we introduce the theory of induced gravity in the standard model .",
    "the cosmological equations for an isotropic universe as well as the slow rollover conditions for inflation are presented in section [ s3 ] .",
    "after that , in section [ s4 ] we analyze the two possible scenarios , i.e. , a modified version of new inflation as well as a chaotic inflation model , depending essentially on the initial conditions for the higgs field at the beginning of time .",

    "it is usually taken that @xmath96 , but in fact the dynamics should show up this behavior or at least certain consistency .",
    "for instance , in gr with the _ ad hoc _ inclusion of a scalar field @xmath3 as a source for the inflation , one has that at the `` slow rollover '' epoch @xmath97 and therefore @xmath98 , which implies that    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the hubble expansion rate ( a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the corresponding scalar field , see ref .",

    "( [ eqxp ] ) without source , i.e. , @xmath101 , one has indeed an extra term due to the variation of newton s `` function '' @xmath102 , that is      if @xmath104 the last term does not approach to zero during the rolling down process for @xmath105 .",
    "thus , one has instead of a `` slow '' , rather a `` fast '' rollover dynamics of the higgs field along its potential down hill . on the other side , for @xmath106 there is indeed a `` slow '' rollover dynamics .    with this in mind",
    "one has to look carefully at the contribution of @xmath94 : if one brings @xmath94 from ( [ eqxp ] ) into ( [ eqapp2 ] ) one has that @xmath107 competes with the potential term @xmath108 , and during the rolling down of the potential , when @xmath47 goes from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , @xmath111 dominates the dynamics , and therefore instead of inflation one ends with deflation or at least with a contraction era for the scale factor ; how strong is the contraction era , should be determined by the set of initial conditions @xmath112 .    resuming , if one starts the universe evolution with an ordinary new inflation scenario ( @xmath113 ) , it implies in this theory a `` short '' deflation instead of a `` long '' inflation period , since the higgs field goes relatively fast to its minimum .",
    "this feature should be present in theories of induced gravity with @xmath114 and also for the bdt with this type of potential ( see for example the field equations in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . considering",
    "the opposite limit , @xmath115 , induced gravity models @xcite have proven to be successful for inflation , also if one includes other fields @xcite ; induced gravity theories with a coleman - weinberg potential are also shown to be treatable for a very small coupling constant @xmath30 with @xmath116 @xcite , or with @xmath117 @xcite and @xmath118 as well as @xmath114 @xcite . for",
    "extended or hyperextended inflation models @xcite this problem does not arise because of the presence of vacuum energy during the rollover stage of evolution , which is supposed to be greater than the normal scalar field contribution .    with this concern one has to prepare a convenient scenario for the universe to begin with .",
    "but first we would like to mention that there are some important aspects to be considered in the theory of the electroweak phase transition in order to realize a more realistic cosmological model of inflation . in order",
    "are the issue of the type of the phase transition , depending on the higgs mass , or the right form of potential temperature correction terms , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present theory",
    ", however , the vacuum energy is very large , @xmath119 , because of the gravity non - minimal coupling , which acts like a negative mass term to induce the phase transition ; for a similar view in the context of the su(5 ) gut see ref .",
    "therefore , one can expect , for a wide spectrum of higgs mass values , the temperature corrections to be smaller than the contribution given by the potential eq .",
    "( [ eqph ] ) .",
    "then , in our cosmological approach , we shall achieve the inflationary stage just before the phase transition takes completely place , that is , when @xmath120 .",
    "for that reason , when @xmath121 , the temperature , shifted away due to inflation , shall not play an important role at the universe dynamics .",
    "temperature considerations shall later be important for entropy and particle production during reheating .",
    "next , we analyze the initial conditions of our models .",
    "the initial conditions we have chosen are simply @xmath122 .",
    "equations ( [ eqap])([eqxp ] ) must satisfy the following relations :    the size of the initial universe is if @xmath123 @xmath124 its acceleration has the value @xmath125 \\rho_o \\nonumber\\\\",

    "the question of the choice of the initial value @xmath128 is open : for example , within gr for `` new inflation '' @xmath130 @xcite , whereas for `` chaotic inflation '' @xcite @xmath131 ; from the particle physics point of view one could expect that @xmath132 at the beginning and that it evolves to its broken state @xmath121 at the end of the phase transition .",
    "but what we know now is just that its actual state is the broken one , and how this has been realized in a cosmological context remains still to be an open question .",
    "this extends the theoretical possibilities for cosmological models allowing a mayor window of feasible initial conditions for the scalar field responsible for inflation . for instance",
    ", this is of particular interest for the chaotic inflationary cosmology in induced gravity models @xcite , for which the initial value of the higgs field must be far from its ground state value , @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , we are considering both new and chaotic initial conditions , which shall imply different cosmological scenarios .",
    "* scenario ( a ) ( @xmath134 ) : * from eq .",
    "( [ eqao ] ) it follows that if the initial value of the higgs field is strictly @xmath135 , the universe possesses a singularity .",
    "if the higgs field sits near to its metastable equilibrium point at the beginning ( @xmath136 ) , than @xmath47 grows since @xmath137 , and from eq .",
    "( [ eqappo ] ) one gets that @xmath138 , i.e. , a maximum point for @xmath139 ; thus at the beginning one has a contraction instead of an expansion .",
    "let us call this _",
    "rollover contraction_.    normally it is argued that in bdt with a constant ( or slowly varying ) potential producing a finite vacuum energy density , the vacuum energy is dominant and is used to both to expand the universe and to increase the value of the scalar field .",
    "this `` shearing '' of the vacuum energy to both pursuits is the cause of a moderate power law inflation instead of an exponential one @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the universe begins with a contraction , and therefore the same shearing mechanism , moreover here due to the higgs field , drives a `` friction '' process for the contraction , due to the varying of @xmath102 , making the deflation era always weaker .",
    "furthermore , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eqappo ] ) that the cause of the deacceleration is the negative value of @xmath47 ; then if @xmath140 from eq .",
    "( [ eqxp ] ) it follows @xmath141 , which implies an `` anti - friction '' for @xmath47 that tends to reduce the contraction , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar view , however , applied to the context of gut s .",
    "one may wonder if the rollover contraction can be stopped .",
    "as long as @xmath47 is negative the contraction will not end , but if @xmath47 goes to positive values , impulsed by special initial conditions , one could eventually have that the dynamics dominating term , @xmath142 , be positive enough to drive an expansion .",
    "but due to the nature of eq .",
    "( [ eqxp ] ) , if @xmath47 grows , the term @xmath143 will bring it back to negative values and cause an oscillating behavior around zero , its equilibrium state , with an amplitude which is damped with time due to the redshift factor @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , one has to seek special values of @xmath128 , which will bring @xmath47 dynamically from negative values to great enough positive values to end up with sufficient e - folds of inflation .",
    "one can understand such a peculiar solution to be reached due to the existence of the `` inflation attractor '' , for which the model of inflation is well behaved , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this feature makes clear that this scenario is not generic for inflation , but depends strongly on special initial conditions ; in this sense , this is another type of fine - tuning , which is , indeed , a `` quasi - long '' standing problem always present by choosing the initial value of the inflaton field in new inflationary scenarios .",
    "for instance , in the standard model with a chosen higgs mass value one finds by numerical integration that obtaining the required amount of inflation implies for @xmath128 to be that special value given in table [ t1 ] , see also figures 1(a ) and 2(a ) , but not a very different number than this , otherwise the deflation era does not stop and the universe evolves to an einstein universe with a singularity ; one could consider whether gr singularities are an inevitable consequence of particle physics . in doing these computations",
    ", it has been also assumed , of course , that during the deflation phase the stress energy of other fields , e.g. , radiation or nonrelativistic matter , are smaller than the higgs one , otherwise an expansion follows .    *",
    "scenario ( b ) ( @xmath145 ) : * one could consider initial conditions whereby the higgs terms @xmath146 dominate the dynamics to have a minimum for @xmath139 , i.e. , @xmath147 , and to begin on `` a right way '' with expansion i.e. , inflation .",
    "that means one should start with a value @xmath117 ( far from its minimum ) positive enough to render sufficient e - folds of inflation .",
    "thus , the `` effective '' inflaton potential part is similar to the one proposed in the `` chaotic '' inflationary model @xcite because of the form of the potential and the assumed initial higgs value far from its potential minimum to get eventually the desired inflation , see also @xcite , but in the present theory , of course , we are regarding a much lower energy scale .",
    "then , both this and chaotic inflation scenarios are generic @xcite .",
    "now let us now see how the dynamics of both scenarios works : the curvature term @xmath148 in ( [ eqap ] ) can be neglected only after inflation began ; during the rollover contraction , scenario ( a ) , it plays an important role .",
    "the terms @xmath149 will be comparable to @xmath150 untill the high oscillation period ( @xmath151 ) starts .",
    "for instance , in the chaotic scenario ( b ) , the slow rollover condition @xmath96   of induced gravity . ] is valid , which implies @xmath152 , and then from @xmath153   ~~\\ ] ] ( with @xmath154 ) it follows that for @xmath155 the hubble parameter will be dominated by the potential term to have @xmath156 which for @xmath157 goes over into @xmath158 , giving cause for the slow rollover chaotic dynamics .",
    "indeed , the rollover time is @xmath159 , i.e. , @xmath160 yielding enough e - folds of inflation ( @xmath161 ) requires to choose the initial higgs field value sufficient great , and the slow rollover conditions asures an inflationary stage ; for @xmath162 it follows that @xmath163 ; this value can be checked by numerical integration , see figure 1(b ) and 2(b ) .",
    "note that the required amount of inflation depends only on the initial value of @xmath164 through @xmath165 , that is , @xmath166 does not depend on the energy scale of inflation but on the initial value @xmath167 ; in other words , enough inflation is performed automatically and independently of @xmath36 as was pointed out in ref .",
    "moreover , it is well known that at higher energy scales the amount of e - folds required for successfully inflation is bigger . in this model",
    "one can see this as follows : suppose that at the time @xmath168 reheating ( rh ) takes place and assume that @xmath169 ( we use this simple relationship , but a properly account of reheating is developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) then one has that @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the entropy of the universe",
    ". therefore the value of @xmath172 should be also greater by increasing the energy scale of inflation .",
    "for instance , for @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( see later discussion ) one obtains the @xmath175 . in table",
    "[ t1 ] are computed the @xmath176 values for three higgs mass values .    on the other side",
    "if @xmath164 is negative , the _ rollover contraction _ phase in scenario ( a ) happens , but in this case eq . ( [ eqtc ] ) indicates @xmath177 , that is , the scale factor evolves slower than the higgs field ; and for special values of @xmath178 , the higgs field evolves to values greater or equal than @xmath179 to gain conditions very similar to scenario ( b ) , see figures 1 and 2 . in table",
    "[ t1 ] are given the initial higgs field values when successfully inflation is achieved in scenario ( a ) for different higgs mass values .",
    "the very special initial value @xmath164 depends also only on @xmath176 ; again because of the fact that at higher energy scales @xmath176 is greater , then @xmath164 is slightly different for the various higgs masses in table [ t1 ] .",
    "summarizing , for the two possibilities of universe s models , one has the following : in the chaotic scenario ( b ) , the initial value should be @xmath180 in order to achieve sufficient e - folds of inflation . and in the scenario ( a ) , only for special initial values of the higgs field , the universe undergoes a small contraction which goes over automatically into a sufficiently long inflation period ; otherwise , for other initial negatives values of @xmath164 , the universe contracts to a singularity .",

    "the dynamics is very similar , giving an output resumed in table [ t1 ] .    at the end of inflation",
    "the higgs field begins to oscillate with a frequency @xmath182 and the numerical solution goes smoothly into an oscillation dominated universe , reaching a normal friedmann regime @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as follows : first when @xmath183 with @xmath184 , @xmath185 is valid , later on when @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 give rise to @xmath189 , i.e. , a matter dominated universe with coherent oscillations , which will hold on if the higgs bosons do not decay ; in figures 3 and 4 the behavior of the scale factor and the higgs field is shown until the time @xmath190 ; the numerics fit very well the `` dark '' matter dominated solutions .",
    "let us consider this possibility more in detail : then , the average over one oscillation of the absolute value of the effective energy density of these oscillations , @xmath191 , is such that @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the time when the rapid oscillation regime begins . from eq .",
    "( [ eqrxosc ] ) one can compute the present ( labeled with a subindex @xmath194 ) energy density of these oscillations if they were to exist . then",
    ", @xmath195 from the figures it is evident that @xmath196 and @xmath197 , and @xmath198 implying , for all higgs mass values chosen in table [ t1 ] , that @xmath199 , i.e. , the higgs oscillations could solve the missing mass problem of cosmology , implying the existence of cold dark matter , since after some time as the universe expands the higgs particles will have a very slow momentum owing to their big mass .",
    "furthermore , if some amount of higgs oscillations decays into relativistic particles with @xmath200 , they can dominate the dynamics of the universe only for a time era , until the density of the remanent oscillations ( if they are still there ) , decreasing as @xmath201 , govern again the scale factor evolution , giving place also in this case to a dark matter dominated universe , even if the remanents strongly interact with each other @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a very important problem : if one tries to explain the today observed baryonic mass of the universe , given by @xmath202 , one has that after inflation it is too small unless the perfect fluid behaves like dust particles ( @xmath203 ) ; moreover , the temperature at that time should also be too small . for solving these problems",
    "one has to assume that some amount of the higgs oscillations decay into baryons and leptons . at the time around @xmath204 the higgs field should decay into other particles with a decay width @xmath205 to give place to a normal matter or radiation universe expansion , producing the reheating of the universe @xcite .",
    "if reheating takes place , the still remaining energy of the scalar field at @xmath204 is converted into its decay products .",
    "this would mean that the cosmological `` function '' disappears to give then rise to the known matter of the universe .",
    "but if coherent oscillations still stand , they are the remanents of that cosmological `` function '' , which is at the present however invisible to us in the form of cold dark matter , moreover , the higgs particle does not interact with the rest of the particles but only gravitationally , therefore , the higgs oscillations do nt change baryogenesis and/or nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "now suppose that the oscillations really did decay .",
    "mathematically , the way of stopping the oscillations or to force the decay is to introduce a term @xmath206 in eq .",
    "( [ eqxp ] ) .",
    "the universe should then reheat up to the temperature @xmath207 where @xmath208 depends , of course , on the decay products , see however ref .",
    "@xcite for a more realistic reheating scenario .",
    "for example , if the coherent oscillations decay into two light fermions , it is valid that @xmath209 ; for the reheating this would mean that @xmath210 which should be enough for non - gut baryogenesis to occur @xcite , for the given higgs mass values of table [ t1 ] .",
    "but one should be aware of the production of gravitational radiation as a decay output of the oscillations @xcite ; however , it could be also possible that other decay channels are important , since the symmetry - breaking takes here place at a much more smaller energy scale than the planck one .",

    "the perturbations on the microwave background temperature are also well fitted .",
    "the gravitational wave perturbations considered normally must also be very small @xcite , @xmath235 for the all above mentioned higgs mass values .",
    "we have presented the induced gravity model coupled to the standard model of particle physics , where the cosmological inflaton is precisely the su(2 ) isovectorial higgs field . as a consequence of this , one has some new features for both particle physics and cosmology .",
    "it was shown that the combination of the fundamental masses of the theory , due to the non - minimal gravity coupling , in a natural way fixes @xmath36 to be @xmath236 and the higgs mass to be @xmath237 less than that in the standard su(2 ) theory .",
    "indeed , the excited higgs decouples from the other particles and interacts just by means of the very weak gravitational field contained in the space - time covariant derivative .",
    "also , because of the non - minimal coupling the vacuum energy responsible for inflation is @xmath119 , bringing the energy scale of inflation equal to that of the higgs mass , by means of eq .",
    "( [ eqhh ] ) . the cosmological equations ( [ eqap]-[eqc ] ) present for @xmath134 a _ rollover contraction _ era in scenario ( a ) , whereby only for special initial values the model can evolve to its `` inflaton attractor '' giving rise , after all , to a chaotic scenario , where inflation takes place by the virtue of a normal rollover approximation .      as a matter of fact",
    ", the cosmological model can not explain by itself the today observed baryon mass of the universe , for which one is forced to look for a reheating scenario after inflation .",
    "a carefully treatment of it is not developed here , but elsewhere @xcite ; nevertheless it was point out the reheating temperature should be enough for non - gut baryogenesis to occur .",
    "however , the question whether to much gravitational radiation is generated to eventually spoil a normal nucleosynthesis procedure remains open at this energy scale .",
    "the right amplitude of scalar and tensor density perturbations required to explain the seeds of galaxy formation imposes very great values to the higgs mass , @xmath220 , otherwise , inflation at lower energy scales does not account for solving that problem . at any energy scale ,",
    "induced gravity models predict a value of the spectral index , @xmath238 , according with the recent observations , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    as a final comment we would like to point out that the induced gravity model in the su(5 ) theory seems to be better accomplished because , in that case , the ratio of the higgs to planck mass is in a natural way of the order of @xmath239 @xcite , achieving right perturbation amplitudes .",
    "contrary to that case , the present su(2 ) higgs gravity inflationary model requires unnatural big higgs mass values in order to render a successfully cosmology .",
    "this is , somehow , the price paid in matching gravity to a very low energy scale ; it reminds us once more of a quasi - long standing problem of inflation : whereas cosmology is happy , particle physics is infelicitous , or inversely .",
