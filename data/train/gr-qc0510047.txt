    "in previous papers @xcite we showed that the standard relative dynamics , in the background of the natural splitting developed by cattaneo @xcite , can be described in terms of a gravito - electromagnetic ( gem ) formal analogy .",
    "in other words , the time+space splitting allows to write the equation of motion of a particle , in arbitrary space - times , in analogy with the equation of motion of a charged particle acted upon by a `` generalized '' lorentz force , in flat space - time .",
    "this analogy holds in full theory and , in linear approximation , it corresponds to the well known analogy between the theory of electromagnetism and the linearized theory of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , gravito - electromagnetism in relativistic gravity is somewhat ubiquitous , because of its `` many faces '' @xcite , and various approaches prove useful for studying gravitational phenomena in terms of electromagnetic ones @xcite .",
    "our gem approach to the study of relativistic dynamics leads to what we called gravito - magnetic ( gm ) aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "indeed , in the past other authors @xcite suggested the possibility of describing the phase shift and time delay , induced by inertial and gravitational fields , in terms of an analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect for the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "our formalism applies to both inertial and gravitational fields , holds in full theory and generalizes the previous results , which were obtained , almost always , at first order approximation ( with respect to @xmath0 , i.e. in the slow motion approximation ) .",
    "we already used this approach to obtain a derivation `` by analogy '' of the sagnac phase shift and time delay , for matter or light beams counter - propagating on a round trip , in a rotating reference frame in flat space - time @xcite , and our results are in agreement with the fully relativistic treatment of the sagnac effect given by anandan @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we exploited the formal analogy between matter beams ( or light beams ) counter propagating along circular trajectories in inertial fields , and charged beams propagating in a region where a magnetic vector potential is present .",
    "in other words , we showed that the sagnac effect may be thought of as a gm aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "here we are concerned with the generalization of those results to curved space - times : we study the sagnac effect in the space - time around a weakly gravitating and rotating source , in kerr space - time , in gdel universe and schwarzschild space - time , and we derive the sagnac time - delay by following the analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect . in doing so , we recover some old results @xcite , and suggest that our approach can be applied to arbitrary stationary and axially symmetric geometries .",
    ") between the emission and absorption of the co - propagating ( + ) and counter - propagating ( - ) beam.,width=226,height=188 ]    the sagnac effect has been thoroughly studied in the past , and it has been detected in many experiments ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is well known that when observing the interference between light or matter beams ( such as light beams , electron or neutron beams and so on ) counter - propagating in flat space - time along a closed path in a rotating interferometer a fringe shift @xmath1 arises .",
    "this phase shift can be interpreted as a time difference between the propagation times ( as measured by a clock at rest on the rotating interferometer ) of the co - rotating and counter - rotating beam .    by applying cattaneo s splitting , the dynamics of massive or massless particles , relative to a given time - like congruence @xmath2 of unit vectors @xmath3 , can be described in terms of a `` gravito - electromagnetic '' fields @xcite . by exploiting this fact , in @xcite",
    "we already showed that the sagnac effect , for both matter and light beams , counter - propagating on a round trip in a interferometer rotating in flat space - time , may be obtained by following a formal analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "this procedure can be generalized to study the sagnac effect in curved space - time , in order to obtain the gr corrections .",
    "then , we can study the interference process of matter or light beams in a rotating frame in curved space - time in terms of the gm aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "in other words , this corresponds to calculating the gm aharonov - bohm phase shift ( see @xcite ) @xmath4 detected by a uniformly rotating interferometer , and the time difference @xmath5 measured by a comoving observer provided with a standard clock .",
    "the time difference ( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) corresponds to the sagnac time - delay : we notice that its expression clearly evidences the `` universal '' character of the sagnac effect , since the mass @xmath6 , or more correctly , the energy ) @xmath6 is the standard relative mass or standard relative energy of the particles of the beams ( see @xcite ) .",
    "] of the particles of the interfering beams does not appear .",
    "so , the sagnac effect turns out to be an effect of the geometry of space - time , and it can be considered universal , in the sense that it is the same , independently of the physical nature of the interfering beams .    as we said , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) expresses the delay , for a round trip , between the propagation time of the co - propagating and counter - propagating beam ( see figure [ fig : sphere ] ) . in what follows ,",
    "the two beams are supposed to have the same velocity ( in absolute value ) with respect to the rotating frame .",
    "furthermore , the particles of the beams are supposed to be spinless , or their spins are neglected .",
    "it is easy to recognize that this analogy between the sagnac effect and the aharonov - bohm effect holds in arbitrary stationary and axially symmetric geometries .",
    "hence , in these cases , for studying the sagnac effect it is sufficient to express the space - time metric in coordinates adapted to a congruence of rotating observers .",
    "generally speaking , the metrics we deal with are given in coordinates adapted to a congruence of asymptotically inertial observers ; if the coordinates are spherical , the passage to a congruence of observers uniformly rotating in the equatorial plane is obtained by applying the ( azimuthal ) coordinates transformation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ( constant ) angular velocity .",
    "then , it is simple to apply the formalism that we have already used in @xcite : the following steps give a prescription for calculating the sagnac effect in arbitrary stationary and axially symmetric geometries in both flat and curved space - times .. ]    * define the time - like congruence @xmath2 of rotating observers .",

    "we calculate the sagnac effect in some curved space - times of physical interest ( weak field space - time , kerr space - time , gdel s universe , schwarzschild space - time ) by applying the formalism described above .",
    "the calculations are performed in full details for the case of the space - time around a weakly gravitating and rotating source , to give an example .    before going on ,",
    "let us point out that , when dealing with weak field , schwarzschild and kerr space - times , we consider beams counter propagating around the source of gravitational field , in its equatorial plane , along circular space trajectories defined by @xmath12 . in the case of gdel s universe , there is not a localized source , but matter is everywhere . nonetheless , because of the spatial homogeneity of gdel solution we may consider , again , without loss of generality , beams propagating along circular trajectories @xmath12 in the equatorial plane defined by our choice of coordinates .",

    "the last term in ( [ eq : wf1 ] ) is responsible for the rotation of the local inertial frames , the so called lense - thirring effect ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we see that even when @xmath28 a time difference appears : this is due to the rotation of the source of the gravitational field . in other words",
    "@xmath29 is what a non rotating observer would obtain when measuring the propagation time for a complete round trip of the two beams , moving in opposite direction along circular orbits @xmath12 .",
    "this time difference corresponds to the so called _ gravito - magnetic time delay _ , which has been obtained by stodolski @xcite , cohen - mashhoon @xcite in weak field approximation , and by tartaglia @xcite , by a first order approximation of the time delay in kerr space - time .    by inspection of the time delay ( [ eq : wf6 ] ) we recognize that there is a critical angular velocity @xmath30 such that @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath30 corresponds to the angular velocity of the `` locally non rotating observers '' @xmath33 of the weak field described by the metric ( [ eq : wf1 ] ) .",

    "gdel s solution of einstein s field equation describes , roughly speaking , a rotating universe @xcite .",
    "this solution , indeed , is not satisfactory on the observational viewpoint , since it does not agree with the expansion of the universe and with the cosmological observations of the cosmic background radiation @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of gdel s solutions is that it admits closed time - like curves @xcite . despite these pathologies",

    "the vortex vector gives the ( local ) rate of rotation of the set of the neighbouring particles of the congruence relative to the ( local ) compass of inertia .",
    "in other words , the ( constant ) angular velocity @xmath50 expresses the rotation of the particles of the reference fluid with respect to local gyroscopes .",
    "this means that , in gdel s universe , matter rotates with constant angular velocity in the local inertial frames of its comoving observers .",

    "in other words , the propagation is symmetrical in both directions .",
    "in the context of natural splitting , the relative formulation of dynamics can be expressed in terms of gem fields ; this analogy , which holds in full theory , leads to the formulation of the gm aharonov - bohm effect .",

    "in particular , we have studied the gr corrections to the sagnac effect in the space - time around a weakly gravitating and rotating source , in kerr space - time , in gdel universe and in schwarzschild space - time .",
    "the sagnac effect has a `` universal '' character : in other words , the sagnac time - delay is the same , independently of the physical nature and velocities of the interfering beams , provided that the latter are locally the same , in absolute value , as seen in the rotating frame , as we explained in full details , by using a direct approach , in @xcite . in our formalism",
