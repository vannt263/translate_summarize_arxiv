    "on a complex manifold , the existence of a _ complex - riemannian metric _ implies , in general , strong topological assumptions , especially if the manifold is compact ( _ e.g. _ the  square of the  canonical bundle has to be trivial ) .",
    "however , any analytic ( pseudo- ) riemannian ( or conformal ) manifold can be complexified , and a natural question is to see to what extent the _ global _ properties of the real manifold ( _ e.g. _ existence of closed ( null- ) geodesics ) hold for the complexified spaces .",
    "this complexification procedure naturally occurs in _ twistor theory _ ( see below ) , which has been intensively studied for riemannian space - times ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; the complex - riemannian setting , in which historically the twistor theory was first introduced @xcite , can provide a link to the lorentzian geometry .    in _ complex conformal geometry _ ( which implies weaker assumptions on the topology of the manifold ) , the conformal structure is determined by the set of _ null - geodesics _ , which can be organized as a complex manifold under some topological conditions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a natural question is which complex conformal manifolds admit compact null - geodesics ; for example , if a _",
    "self - dual _ manifold admits a globally - defined _ twistor space _",
    ", then application of a twistorial interpretation of the weyl tensor @xcite , implies that it is conformally flat , and the compact null - geodesic is simply - connected .",
    "our main result ( section 4 , theorem [ comp3 ] ) states that , if a conformal complex @xmath0-manifold admits a rational curve as a null - geodesic , then it is conformally flat ( see also @xcite for the case of a complex projective manifold ) .",
    "the proof uses the properties of jacobi fields along the considered compact , simply - connected , null - geodesic  : namely , we compute the normal bundle of a compact , simply - connected , null - geodesic , and we show that the small deformations of the latter as a compact curve , or as a null - geodesic , coincide ( section 4 , proposition [ deform ] ) . in addition to that , we use , for the ( more difficult ) case of dimension 3 , a criterion for conformal flatness from @xcite , and we apply it to a _ locally defined _ , by the _",
    "lebrun correspondence _",
    "( see below ) , self - dual ambient .",
    "the other topic of this paper uses implicitly another application of twistor theory : it has been shown by lebrun @xcite , @xcite , that any conformal 3-manifold can be locally realized as the _ conformal infinity _ of a self - dual einstein ( with non - zero scalar curvature ) 4-manifold .",
    "we have , thus , a local correspondence assigning to a conformal structure in dimension 3 a self - dual einstein metric in dimension 4 , which we call the _ lebrun correspondence_.    as conformal structures of both manifolds are encoded in the complex , resp .",
    "@xmath1 , structure of their twistor spaces , they are implicitly related , for example if the 3-manifold @xmath2 is conformally flat , its ambient @xmath3 equally is .",
    "it is , however , difficult to obtain an explicit relation between the conformal invariants of @xmath2 and those of @xmath3 by twistorial methods , as there is no simple expression of the _ cotton - york tensor _ of @xmath4 in twistorial terms , and the twistorial interpretation of the _ weyl tensor _ of @xmath5 is highly non - linear @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we find a relation between these two conformal invariants of the manifolds involved in the lebrun correspondence , or , more generally , of an umbilic submanifold @xmath4 and of its self - dual ambient @xmath5 .",
    "it appears that the weyl tensor of @xmath5 identically vanishes along @xmath4 , and thus the cotton - york tensor of @xmath5 , restricted to @xmath4 , is conformally invariant and can be identified with the cotton - york tensor of @xmath4 ; in this case , it is also equal to the normal derivative of the weyl tensor of @xmath5 ( section 3 , theorem [ umbilic ] ) .",
    "this gives conditions for an open self - dual 4-manifold to admit a conformal infinity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows  : in section 2 we recall a few basic facts about complex- riemannian and -conformal geometry , in section 3 we relate the conformal invariants of a 3-dimensional conformal infinity to those of its self - dual ambient ( arising from the lebrun correspondence ) , and in section 4 we state our results about conformal complex manifolds containing compact null - geodesics .    throughout the paper we use the following conventions",
    ": in complex - riemannian ( or -conformal ) geometry we use the same terminology as in the real framework ( metric , levi - civita connection , curvature ) , and the holomorphic bundles are denoted like the corresponding bundles in real geometry ( for example , the holomorphic tangent bundle of * m * is denoted simply by @xmath6 , rather than the more precise @xmath7 )  ; manifolds with holomorphic conformal structures are denoted by bold - face letters ( except in section 3 , where the results hold also in the real framework ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a complex manifold , let @xmath0 be its complex dimension .",
    "a _ complex - riemannian metric _",
    "@xmath9 on it is a holomorphic section of @xmath10 which is non - degenerate at any point .",
    "holomorphic conformal structure _ on @xmath8 is a holomorphic line subbundle @xmath11 in @xmath10 such that any non - vanishing local section of @xmath11 is a local complex - riemannian metric .    during the rest of this section , and of the whole fourth section of this paper",
    ", we shall simply denote these structures as _ metric _ and _ conformal structure _ ( therefore omitting any reference to the complex framework ) .",
    "a metric on @xmath6 induces metrics ( i.e. non - degenerate symmetric bilinear forms ) on all tensor bundles , in particular the square of the canonical bundle @xmath12 is trivialized . if we can choose _ an orientation _",
    "( defined as follows ) , then the canonical bundle itself can be trivialized by a _ volume form _ of norm 1 .",
    "there are exactly 2 such forms in each fiber of @xmath13 , and an _ orientation _ is the choice of one of them , depending continously ( thus holomorphically ) on the base point .",
    "the notion of _ orientation _ is generally related to the reduction ( when possible ) of the structure group of the frame bundle from @xmath14 to the connected component of the identity @xmath15 ; in absence of any structure , the group @xmath14 is simply the connected @xmath16 , so the notion of orientation has no meaning in `` raw '' complex geometry . but",
    "a riemannian metric on @xmath8 is equivalent to the reduction of its frame bundle to a @xmath17-bundle , where @xmath18 ; a further choice of an orientation reduces the structure group of the frame bundle to the connected component of this group , containing the identity : @xmath19 .    unlike in the real framework",
    ", these reductions , always possible on ( small ) contractible open sets , are submitted to some topological constraints if we want to define them globally on @xmath8 .",
    "weaker constraints are implied by the existence of a conformal structure  : the square of the canonical bundle needs to admit a @xmath0th order root @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the is a square root of @xmath11 ; the choice of such a square root is implied , if @xmath22 , by the conformal structure @xmath11 as @xmath23 ; if @xmath0 is even , neither @xmath11 nor an orientation  see below  imply the choice of @xmath24 . ] ( respectively , one of the ) _ weight 1density bundle _ of the manifold @xmath8 .",
    "we can study the conformal structure @xmath11 using the formalism of density bundles and of weyl derivatives @xcite . from now on , we shall not make use of the weight 1density bundle , but only of @xmath25 , which is enough to define the conformal structure .    a conformal structure is equivalent to the reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle to @xmath26 ( the quotient is due to the fact that @xmath27 ) .",
    "this group is disconnected if @xmath0 is even , and the connected component of * 1 * is @xmath28 , but it is connected if @xmath0 is odd ( and in this case the right hand side of the previous equality coincides with @xmath29 ) . therefore , although a complex - riemannian 3-manifold admits , locally , 2 possible orientations , they are conformally equivalent , fact that makes impossible a canonical way to associate an orientation to a metric in the conformal class .    in complex- , as in real - riemannian geometry , the orientation determines ( and is determined by ) a family of compatible oriented orthonormal basis in @xmath6 ; if @xmath30 is even , by multiplying all the vectors of such a basis by a non - zero complex number we obtain an oriented orthonormal basis compatible with another metric in the conformal class ( if @xmath30 is odd , multiplication by @xmath31 yields a basis compatible with the same metric , but with the opposite orientation ) .",

    "we are going to show later that all @xmath218 are equal to 1 .",
    "first we prove :      we consider the projectivized bundle @xmath38 of the isotropic cone @xmath37 .",
    "it is a standard fact @xcite that any null - geodesic @xmath219 has a canonical _ horizontal _",
    "lift @xmath220 ( depending only on the conformal structure ) , such that @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the projection , and @xmath223 .",
    "the lifts of the null - geodesics of * m * consist in a foliation of @xmath38 , which has a compact , simply - connected leaf , namely the lift @xmath224 of our compact , simply - connected null - geodesic @xmath157 . by reeb s stability theorem @xcite , then there is a _ saturated _ tubular neighbourhood of @xmath224 , diffeomorphic to @xmath225 ( where @xmath226 is a polydisc ) , such that the leaves close to @xmath224 are identified , via the above diffeomorphism , to the ( compact and simply - connected ) curves @xmath227 .",
    "so all null - geodesics close to @xmath157 are compact and simply connected .",
    "if @xmath157 has self - intersections at the points @xmath228 , we blow - up * m * at those points , and the lift of @xmath157 is now embedded .",
    "so must be then the lifts of the null - geodesics close to @xmath157 , as they are now deformations of the lifted ( hence , embedded ) curve .",
    "but , generically , such curves avoid the finite set of points @xmath228 ; the corresponding null - geodesics must have been embedded from the beginning .",
    "we compute the normal bundle of @xmath157 in * m * , using the relation ( [ fibnorm ] ) and the projection @xmath229 , as follows : we have the following exact sequence of bundles : @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the normal subbundle of @xmath224 represented by vectors tangent to the fibers of @xmath232 and @xmath233 is the normal bundle of @xmath224 in @xmath38 . in a point @xmath234 ,",

    "we have then :    [ deform ] the normal bundle of a compact , simply - connected , null - geodesic @xmath157 in * m * is isomorphic to @xmath244 and all its global sections are induced by jacobi fields @xmath180 such that @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , the deformations of @xmath157 as a compact curve coincide with the null - geodesics close to @xmath157 .",
    "the last statement follows from the expression of the normal bundle , and a theorem of kodaira @xcite : the normal bundle satisfies @xmath245 , thus the space of deformations of @xmath157 as a compact curve has dimension equal to @xmath246 , which is precisely the dimension of the space of null - geodesics , defined locally , over a geodesically convex open set , as the space of the leaves of the horizontal foliation of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we conclude using the fact that all null - geodesics close to @xmath157 are deformations of this one ( as a compact , and simply - connected , curve ) .",
    "we return to the proof of theorem [ comp3 ] .",
    "consider first the case when the dimension of * m * , @xmath179 .",
    "we are going to show that the weyl tensor of * m * , @xmath46 , is identically zero ( a special sub - case is @xmath69 , when @xmath247 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "suppose first that @xmath81 , and consider the fiber of @xmath190 at an arbitrary point @xmath248 : it has a non - degenerate conformal structure , induced from * m * , and the isotropy cone spans the whole fiber @xmath249 ( this still holds for @xmath69 , but not for @xmath68 ) .",
    "let @xmath250 be an isotropic line .",
    "we have :    [ paralel ] let @xmath251 be an open set of the null - geodesic @xmath157 , on which local metrics @xmath252 are well defined .",
    "if a ( locally defined , over @xmath251 ) line subbundle @xmath253 is parallel ( or stable ) for @xmath183 , then it is parallel for @xmath254 as well .",
    "let @xmath255 be linearly independent isotropic lines in @xmath249 .",
    "according to the previous lemma , and to the fact that @xmath157 is simply - connected , their parallel transport over @xmath157 does not depend on any levi - civita connection of a metric in the conformal class .",
    "we get , thus , a _ global _ splitting @xmath256 where the line bundles @xmath257 are all isotropic and parallel .",
    "all these bundles are isomorphic to @xmath258 . as their sections",
    "are also sections of @xmath259 , they can not vanish at more that 1 point , for each @xmath260 , thus @xmath261 .",
    "on the other hand , the sum of all @xmath262 s has to be @xmath263 , thus @xmath264 .",
    "let @xmath265 be a section of @xmath260 ; from proposition [ deform ] , it is locally represented by a jacobi field @xmath266 , for the metric @xmath187 . from the jacobi equation , by taking the scalar product with @xmath180 , we get : @xmath267 and it is easy to see that , because of the fact that all scalar products involving @xmath177 and @xmath180 are 0 , the term @xmath268 of the curvature ( [ h3 ] ) satisfies the above relation identically .",
    "this equation holds , at @xmath148 , for any isotropic vector @xmath269 , but we may consider also other compact , simply - connected , null - geodesics @xmath270 , containing @xmath148 , and close to @xmath157 ( namely , small deformations of the compact curve @xmath157 ) .    for any 2-plane @xmath271*m * , we denote by @xmath272 the _ sectional curvature _ of @xmath159 : @xmath273 and we have seen that , if @xmath159 is totally isotropic , @xmath272 depends only on @xmath46 ( and on the metric @xmath9 only via the scalar product @xmath274 ) .",
    "[ weylf ] if @xmath275 , the weyl tensor at @xmath276 , @xmath277 , is determined by the sectional curvatures @xmath278 , for @xmath279 a small neighbourhood of the totally isotropic arbitrary 2-plane @xmath280 in the grassmanian of totally isotropic 2-planes at @xmath148 .",
    "a similar statement holds in dimension 4 , but in that case , the grassmanian of totally isotropic 2-planes has 2 connected components ; as a consequence , @xmath44 is determined by the sectional curvatures of @xmath42-planes , and @xmath45 by the sectional curvatures of the @xmath43-planes @xcite , proposition 2 .",
    "this reduces to the claim that @xmath281 if and only if @xmath282 which is a problem of linear algebra . if we consider the space @xmath283 of all curvature tensors @xmath284 satisfying @xmath285 , then this is a vector space , which is invariant to the action of @xmath286 ( which is the lie algebra infinitesimal action corresponding to the action of @xmath287  note that the grassmanian of totally isotropic planes is preserved by this action ) .",
    "but there are only 3 @xmath286-irreducible components of the space of curvature tensors , and we have seen that for the ricci - like tensors @xmath268 , the totally isotropic planes always have zero sectional curvature . then either any weyl tensor satisfying ( [ www ] ) is zero at @xmath148 , or @xmath283 contains the whole space of curvature tensors . the latter possibility can easily be excluded by an example of a curvature tensor @xmath288 satisfying : @xmath289 @xmath290    from ( [ eq : curv ] ) and the previous lemma we conclude that @xmath281 for any @xmath148 contained in a compact , simply - connected , null - geodesic ; but we know from proposition [ deform ] that the set of such points contains a neighbourhood of @xmath157 , thus , by analyticity of @xmath46 , it vanishes identically .",
    "the proof is similar in dimension 4 ( note that , in the self - dual case , we can retrieve the result by applying theorem [ 3 ] ; this is how we shall proceed for the case of dimension 3 , using the lebrun correspondence ) ; the difference with the higher - dimensional case is that the splitting ( [ split ] ) is canonical , @xmath291 corresponding , say , to the @xmath42-plane @xmath292 containing @xmath177 , and @xmath293 to the @xmath43-plane @xmath294 containing @xmath177 .",
    "it is important now that _ each of _ @xmath295 is isomorphic to @xmath51 , because the vanishing of @xmath296 implies @xmath297 , and the vanishing of @xmath298 implies @xmath73 @xcite , proposition 2 .",
    "thus the manifold @xmath49 is conformally flat .",
    "consider now the particular case where @xmath68 .",
    "we are going to use the lebrun correspondence , then theorem [ 3 ] , to prove that * m * is then conformally flat .",
    "note that we can not use directly theorem [ umbilic ] and the above proven result for self - dual manifolds , as the ambient self - dual manifold @xmath95 can only be defined for a _ civilized _ ( e.g. geodesically convex ) 3-manifold .",
    "we cover @xmath157 with geodesically convex open sets @xmath299 , such that : @xmath300 where @xmath301 is still geodesically convex ( with respect to some particular levi - civita connection ) .",
    "this is possible by choosing @xmath302 , small enough @xcite .",
    "then we choose a relatively compact tubular neighbourhood @xmath303 of @xmath157 , such that its closure is covered by the @xmath304 s .",
    "we may choose this tubular neighbourhood small enough to be contained in the projection @xmath305 , from @xmath38 , of a saturated neighbourhood ( see proposition [ tub3 ] ) of the lift @xmath224 .",
    "we consider then the twistor spaces @xmath306 , the spaces of null - geodesics of @xmath304 .",
    "the compact , simply - connected , null - geodesics close to @xmath157 identify ( diffeomorphically ) the neighbourhoods of @xmath307 with the space @xmath48 of the deformations ( contained in @xmath305 ) of @xmath157 as a compact curve .",
    "we can see then ( a small open set of ) @xmath48 as an open set common to all the @xmath306 s :      the local twistor spaces @xmath306 admit contact structures , which coincide on @xmath48 , and contain projective lines @xmath309 corresponding to points @xmath310 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath311 the twistor space of @xmath301 , then @xmath311 is identified to an open set in @xmath306 and , at the same time , to an open set in @xmath312 , in particular the twistor lines @xmath313 and @xmath314 ( corresponding to the same point @xmath315 ) are identified .",
    "thus @xmath316 and @xmath317 coincide and we denote by @xmath170 this ( non - compact ) curve in @xmath48 , and by @xmath159 the canonical contact structure of @xmath48 ( restricted from the ones of @xmath306 ) .",
    "we already have obtained that the integral @xmath42-cone ( _ i.e. _ the union of twistor lines passing through @xmath156 and tangent to @xmath158 , see the comment after theorem [ 3 ] ) corresponding to @xmath158 is a part of a smooth surface : the union of the lines @xmath170 , @xmath248 .",
    "thus , from theorem [ 3 ] , the weyl tensor @xmath318 of the self - dual manifold @xmath308 vanishes on the @xmath42-planes generated by @xmath204 .",
    "but this is nothing new : we know , from theorem [ umbilic ] , that @xmath318 vanishes on @xmath304 .    we intend to apply theorem [ 3 ] to prove that @xmath318 vanishes on points close to @xmath304 , but generically in @xmath319 .",
    "we do that by showing that the integral @xmath42-cones corresponding to planes @xmath320 close to @xmath159 are parts of smooth surfaces , then we conclude using theorem [ 3 ] .",
    "first we choose hermitian metrics @xmath321 on @xmath306 , such that they coincide ( with @xmath34 ) on @xmath48 .",
    "we have a diffeomorphism between @xmath157 and @xmath322 , so we choose relatively compact open sets in @xmath323 , covering @xmath322 , with the following properties : as the metrics @xmath321 induce metrics on @xmath324 , we first choose a small enough distance @xmath325 such that    1 .",

    "we first note that the projection @xmath332 from @xmath308 to @xmath343 is equivalent to the @xmath34orthogonal projection of the direction of @xmath344 to a direction in @xmath158 , so @xmath345 ; thus @xmath330 belongs to both @xmath304 and @xmath346 , and we use again the twistor space @xmath311 to conclude that @xmath347 and @xmath348 are `` restrictions '' to @xmath48 of the same projective line ( as they both have the same tangent space at @xmath156 ) @xmath349 , for a point @xmath350 .",
