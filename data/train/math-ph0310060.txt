    "in this letter we extend the analysis of @xcite , where a new method for the solution of oscillatory nonlinear problems was devised .",
    "this method works by combining the lindstedt - poincar ( lp )  @xcite method to the linear delta expansion ( lde)@xcite , or optimized perturbation theory ( opt )  @xcite .",
    "a detailed list of references on the lde can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lp method is used to solve approximately nonlinear differential equations with periodic solutions , by introducing strained coordinates , which allow to eliminate the secular terms arising in the perturbative expansion ; in the lde method an insoluble theory is interpolated with a soluble one depending on some arbitrary parameter : an expansion is then carried out in terms of a suitably defined `` perturbation '' . since the `` perturbation '' is not a priori fixed and not necessarily expressed in terms of `` small '' parameters , the method is truly nonperturbative .    as proved in @xcite the application of lde to the lp method , which is at the core of our method , allows to extend the analysis to the nonperturbative regime ( large nonlinearities ) and to obtain errors which are small even in regimes where the lp method fails completely .    in this letter",
    "we pursue two goals : on one hand to investigate the convergence of our method in the cases previously analyzed to higher orders ; on the other hand to test the method by applying it to more demanding problems , such as the van der pol equation .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : duff ] we study the duffing equation and discuss the convergence of the method ; in section  [ sec : anharm ] we analyze more general anharmonic potentials ( sextic and octic ) ; finally , in section  [ sec : vdp ] we consider the van der pol equation . finally in section  [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the duffing equation , which describes the oscillations of a unit mass in a potential @xmath0 .",
    "it reads : ( t ) + x(t ) = -  x^3(t )  .",
    "[ duf1 ] @xmath1 is a coupling which controls the strength of the nonlinear term .",
    "the application of the lplde method requires to write eq.([duf1 ] ) as ^2   + ( 1 + ^2 )   x ( ) =  , [ duf2 ] where @xmath2 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath3 is the exact frequency of the system .",
    "we also introduced a power - counting parameter @xmath4 , which allows to recover eq .",
    "( [ duf1 ] ) when the value @xmath5 is taken .",
    "the r.h.s . of eq.([duf2 ] ) is then treated as a perturbation , although its size is not fixed , being @xmath2 completely arbitrary .",
    "when the perturbative expansion is carried out to finite order , a spurious dependence upon this parameter will show up in all the observables .",
    "the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) will then be used to choose a @xmath2 which minimizes this dependence .",
    "this procedure is explained in detail in @xcite .    to a given order @xmath6",
    "we write the frequency and the solution as ^2 = _ n=0^n_max  ^n  _",
    "n  ,  x(t ) = _",
    "n=0^n_max  ^n  x_n ( )  .",
    "[ omegax ] and we take @xmath5 at the end . both the coefficients @xmath7 ( which are obtained by eliminating the resonant contributions at any given perturbative order ) and the solutions @xmath8 are @xmath2-dependent .",
    "the dependence upon the arbitrary parameter is then eliminated by imposing the pms condition @xmath9 .",
    "remarkably we have observed that the solution to this equation to any given order is approximated extremely well by the third order solution , i.e. @xmath10 , both for positive and negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to obtain expressions which are completely _",
    "analytical_. we can also attach a more physical meaning to the pms condition by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig000 ] : in this figure we plot the energy of the oscillator evaluated at @xmath11 , where all the energy is kinetic , and compare it with the exact expression for the energy , which is given by the potential energy at the inversion point .",
    "the approximate solution found with eq .",
    "( [ omegax ] ) violates the conservation of energy by an amount which depends upon @xmath2 .",
    "however , when the optimal value of @xmath2 is used ( the vertical line in the figure ) such violation is nearly minimal .",
    ".the vertical line is the optimal value to third order .",
    "we assume @xmath12 and @xmath13.,width=340 ]    we have noticed that the coefficients @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( [ omegax ] ) can be written as : _ 0 = 1 +  a^2  ,   _ 2 n = -  ,   _ 2 n+1 = 0 [ alpha ] where the @xmath15 are purely numerical coefficients and @xmath16 .",
    "such relations hold for all the @xmath14 that we have calculated . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we plot the logarithm of the coefficients , for @xmath17 ; the dashed line is a linear fit corresponding to : _",
    "n = 0.0663 e^-1.46225  n [ kappa ] with @xmath18 even .",

    "in this work we have extended the analysis carried out in @xcite and we have applied the lplde method to much higher orders : we have observed that the results obtained converge quickly to the exact values , with errors which decay exponentially with the perturbative order .",
    "this behaviour was observed for the duffing equation , for the sextic and octic oscillator .",
    "remarkably the results obtained to _ any given order _ with our method are fully analytical .",
    "the method was then tested on the van der pol equation where the calculations were performed up to order @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", we were able to obtain good results for moderate values of @xmath1 ( @xmath29 ) , where the lp method already fails .",
    "these results suggest that the extension of the method to higher orders could extend the region of application to larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , although the optimal value of the variational parameter is not known analytically , as in the previous case , the use of a @xmath1 dependent fit allowed us to obtain also in this case a semi - analytical approximation for the frequency ( period ) which holds in the region of moderate @xmath1 .    it remains to explore the application of the present method to a wider class of nonlinear problems with periodic solutions , as well as studying the van der pol equation to higher orders .",
