    "<S> in this paper we prove that if @xmath0 is a tunnel number one knot which admits a dehn filling resulting in a lens space then @xmath1 is in the berge list .      </S>",
    "<S> one of the main goals of low dimensional topology is to determined which manifolds are obtained by a dehn filling on a knot in the @xmath2-sphere . </S>",
    "<S> a major achievement of @xmath2-manifold research in the 80 s was the proof by c. gordon and j. luecke @xcite that if non - trivial surgery on a knot yields @xmath3 then the knot must be the trivial knot . </S>",
    "<S> just before then was the important positive resolution of the property @xmath4 conjecture by d. gabai @xcite , who proved that one can only obtain @xmath5 by @xmath6-surgery on a trivial knot in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> that done , a following natural question is :    * question : * which knots in @xmath3 other than the unknot have non - trivial surgery resulting in a lens space which is not @xmath3 or @xmath5 ?    </S>",
    "<S> this question was first raised by l. moser in 1971 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> she determined the surgeries on torus knots yielding lens spaces . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , bleiler and litherland @xcite , wang @xcite and wu @xcite , independently , characterised the surgeries on satellite knots in @xmath3 which result in lens spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the question is still unresolved for hyperbolic knots .    in @xcite john </S>",
    "<S> berge compiled a list of twelve families of knots @xmath7 all of which are tunnel number one knots and all are doubly primitive , ( see section [ sec : primitive ] for a definition ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these knots have surgeries resulting in lens spaces . </S>",
    "<S> this list came to be known as the _ berge list _ and it includes the known cases of torus and satellite knots . </S>",
    "<S> then , j. berge asked in 1995 if the list is complete ( see @xcite problem 1.78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this question became to be known as _ the berge conjecture _ :    [ con : bergeconjecture ] let @xmath7 be a non - trivial knot which has dehn surgery resulting in a lens space . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath1 belongs to the berge list .    in his celebrated notes , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite , w. thurston proved that there are only finitely many dehn fillings on a hyperbolic knot so that the resulting manifolds obtained by the corresponding dehn fillings fail to be hyperbolic . </S>",
    "<S> that means that the resulting manifold either contains an essential torus , an essential @xmath8-sphere , has a finite fundamental group or is a small seifert fibered space . </S>",
    "<S> since then there was a huge effort by many mathematicians to determine these fillings . </S>",
    "<S> the berge conjecture can be viewed as a special case of this huge task .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath7 be a knot . </S>",
    "<S> we say that @xmath1 admits _ genus reducing surgery _ if @xmath9 has a non - trivial surgery resulting in a manifold @xmath10 so that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the genus of the manifold @xmath13 . it will be called _ strongly genus reducing surgery _ if @xmath14 . throughout the paper @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> denotes an _ </S>",
    "<S> open regular neighborhood _ in the appropriate space .    </S>",
    "<S> a knot @xmath7 is a _ tunnel number @xmath16 knot _ if there is a minimal set of properly embedded arcs ( tunnels ) @xmath17 in @xmath9 so that @xmath18 is a handlebody . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel number @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath19 . in particular if @xmath20 then the handlebody is of genus two . </S>",
    "<S> every non - trivial knot @xmath7 has @xmath21 . if @xmath22 then @xmath23 and if a lens space @xmath10 can be obtained by surgery on @xmath1 then @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the berge conjecture can be divided into two separate conjectures which when put together recover the berge conjecture , namely :    [ con : weakbergeconjecture ] if @xmath7 is a tunnel number one knot and if a lens space can be obtained by dehn - filling of the knot space @xmath9 then @xmath1 is in the berge list .    </S>",
    "<S> [ con : stronggenusreducingconjecture ] knots in @xmath3 do not have strongly genus reducing surgery slopes other than the slope of the meridian .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give a full proof of the berge conjecture for tunnel number one knots by proving the following main theorem :    [ thm : maintheorem ] if @xmath0 is a tunnel number one knot which admits a dehn filling resulting in a lens space , then @xmath1 is in the berge list .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a consequence of the cyclic surgery theorem @xcite that if @xmath7 is a hyperbolic knot only integer slope surgery can yield a lens space . </S>",
    "<S> so the berge conjecture raises the question of which lens spaces can be obtained by integer surgery on a knot in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this question is known as the _ realization problem_.    j. green resolved the realization problem in a remarkable ( see ) annals of mathematics paper . </S>",
    "<S> namely , he proves that if a lens space can be obtained by integer surgery on a knot in @xmath3 then such a lens space can be obtained by a knot in the berge list . </S>",
    "<S> this result is evidence towards theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] and a possible affirmative resolution for the full berge conjecture .    </S>",
    "<S> he further proves , ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 1.3 ) , that every doubly primitive ( see definition [ def : doublyprim ] ) knot in @xmath3 is a berge knot . thus being _ doubly primitive _ is a property that characterizes the knots on the berge list and the berge conjecture can be phrased as :    [ con : doublyprimitive ] if @xmath7 is a knot and a lens space can be obtained by dehn - filling on the knot space @xmath9 , then @xmath1 is doubly primitive .    a weaker conjecture than conjecture [ con : stronggenusreducingconjecture ] which if true , is sufficient together with conjecture [ con : weakbergeconjecture ] for the proof of the berge conjecture .    [ con : weakconjecture ] no knot @xmath7 has an integral slope @xmath25 , so that @xmath25 is a strongly genus reducing surgery slope .    the berge conjecture has been studied extensively , e.g. , by berge himself in @xcite and @xcite also by k. baker , </S>",
    "<S> e. grigsby , and m. hedden , see @xcite , p. ozsvath and z. szabo , see @xcite , j. rasmussen , see @xcite , t. saito , see @xcite , m. tange , see @xcite , @xcite and others . </S>",
    "<S> all the above results use floer homology techniques .    in this paper we take a completely different approach based on dynamics . as the knot </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is a tunnel number one knot , the knot space @xmath7 has a genus two heegaard splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions imposed on the heegaard splitting because @xmath1 has a lens space surgery imply that an associated heegaard diagram of this splitting is composed of `` complicated '' curves if @xmath1 is not a berge knot . by an appropriate choice of orientations on these curves we can define a flow on them . </S>",
    "<S> a careful analysis of this flow shows that the above heegaard splitting can not be a heegaard splitting for @xmath3 ( after trivially filling the knot ) unless @xmath1 is on the berge list , which proves theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> such an approach has not been tried before .    very little </S>",
    "<S> is currently known on either conjecture [ con : stronggenusreducingconjecture ] or conjecture [ con : weakconjecture ] . the only result in this direction </S>",
    "<S> was obtained by k. baker , c. gordon and j. luecke who showed in   the following :    * corollary:*(baker - gordon - luecke ) there is a linear function @xmath26 with the following property : let @xmath27 be a hyperbolic knot in @xmath3 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath1 is the core of the attached solid torus in @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath30 be a genus @xmath31 , strongly irreducible heegaard surface in @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath32 is not a @xmath33-boundary slope for the exterior of @xmath27 then either @xmath34 , or @xmath10 is a seifert fibered space over the @xmath8-sphere with exactly three exceptional fibers , at least one of which has order 2 or 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath28 is the manifold obtained by @xmath32-dehn surgery on @xmath27 and @xmath35 denotes the bridge number of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> note that corollary 1.1 gives a linear bound on the extent to which heegaard genus can decrease under a non - integral dehn surgery .    as mentioned above the situation for non - hyperboloic knots in @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is fully understood . for completion we precisely state what is known : the type i family , in the berge list , </S>",
    "<S> is composed of torus knots and type ii is composed of satellite knots ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> for torus knots l. moser showed in  @xcite , that an @xmath36 surgery on a @xmath37-torus knot results in a lens space if only if @xmath38 , and the lens space obtained is @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for satellite knots was resolved independently by bleiler and litherland @xcite , wang @xcite and y - q . </S>",
    "<S> wu  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they gave a complete classification of satellite knots with lens space surgery and proved that if a satellite knot @xmath1 is not a @xmath40-cable of some @xmath41-torus knot , then nontrivial surgery on @xmath1 will never yield a manifold with cyclic fundamental group .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors wish to thank john berge for pointing out the importance of the papers by t. homa , m. ochiai and m. takahashi @xcite and m. ochiai @xcite to the berge conjecture . </S>",
