    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are catastrophic thermonuclear explosions of massive carbon / oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ) with mass exceeding a critical value . due to the low intrinsic scatter at the peak luminosity , sne ia have been employed as `` standard candles '' for measuring distances and determining cosmological parameters ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the single - degenerate ( sd ) and double - degenerate ( dd ) models are the most popular scenarios for the sn ia progenitors .",
    "the sd models assume a wd in a close binary system accreting material from a nondegenerate companion ( whelan & iben , 1973 ) , while the dd models involve a merger of two wds ( webbink , 1984 ) .",
    "the historical supernova remnant ( snr ) tycho  ( or sn  1572 , g120.1 + 1.4 ) is thought to originate from an sn ia as evidenced by its light curve ( baade 1945 ; ruiz - lapuente 2004 ) , x - ray spectroscopic analysis ( badenes et al .",
    "2006 ) , and light echo spectrum ( krause et al .  2008 ) . however , there is no consensus on its progenitor system .",
    "the sd scenario is supported by the discovery of a fast - moving , type g0g2 subgiant ( tycho - g ) in the snr center , which was suggested to be the surviving companion of the sn ( ruiz - lapuente et al.2004 ) .",
    "lu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found an x - ray arc inside tycho , which was probably produced by the interaction between the sn ejecta and the companion star s envelope lost due to the impact of the explosion .",
    "the sd scenario has , however , been questioned ( badenes et al .",
    "2007 ) . while there is a dispute over whether tycho - g is the ex - companion ( see xue & schaefer 2015 and references therein ) , other candidates such as tycho - b ( kerzendorf et al .",
    "2013 ) and tycho - e ( ihara et al .  2007 ) were also proposed .",
    "another independent method is needed to resolve the progenitor problem of tycho .",
    "one key aspect of the sd and dd scenarios is the presence or absence , respectively , of outflows from the binary system during the pre - sn evolution ( badenes et al .",
    "according to the sd scenario , a strong wind is driven to stabilize the mass transfer when the mass accretion rate exceeds a certain critical value ( e.g. , hachisu et al .",

    "<S> enhanced @xmath0co  @xmath1=21  line emission relative to @xmath0co  @xmath1=10emission and possible line broadenings ( in velocity range @xmath6 to @xmath7  @xmath4 ) are found at the northeastern boundary of the snr , where the shell is deformed and decelerated . </S>",
    "<S> these features , combined with the morphological correspondence between the expanding molecular bubble and tycho , suggest that the snr is associated with the bubble at the velocity range @xmath8 to @xmath9  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the most plausible origin for the expanding bubble is the fast outflow ( with velocity of hundreds @xmath4 ) driven from the vicinity of a wd as it accreted matter from a nondegenerate companion star . </S>",
    "<S> the snr has been expanding in the low - density wind - blown bubble , and the shock wave has just reached the molecular cavity wall . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first unambiguous detection of an expanding bubble driven by the progenitor of a type - ia snr , which constitutes evidence for a single - degenerate progenitor for this sn ia .    </S>"
