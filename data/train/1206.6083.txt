    "the system of euler equations for an incompressible fluid stratified by a gravity field is considered .",
    "it is known that internal gravity waves can propagate within fluids stratified by density in a gravity field .",
    "internal wave breaking is one of interesting nonlinear effects , which is characterized by disintegration of waves with formation of typical spots with intensive small - scale convection inside them .",
    "the spots are often termed convective or turbulent ones because the convection inside them looks like turbulence .",
    "static stability in the fluid becomes recovered with the course of time , but the density inside the spot remains different from the surrounding stratification .",
    "the phenomenon of internal wave breaking going with formation of a convective spot often is termed `` internal wave mixing '' .",
    "the effect of internal wave breaking is often observed in the ocean .",
    "the phenomenon is registered in the atmosphere @xcite as well .",
    "broken down internal waves reorganize stratification with time .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to understand and explain stratification of the ocean or the atmosphere without taking into account the effect .",
    "intensive intermixing of water by internal waves creates good nutrient medium for plankton in the ocean .",
    "regions of the ocean , where wave breaking happens , are generally places of heightened biological productivity .",
    "it stimulates growing interest to them and to the physical effect , being cause of heightened biological productivity .",
    "many papers are dedicated to experimental study of the phenomenon @xcite . in mcewan s experimental papers",
    ", the phenomenon has been studied by means of thin laser measurements .",
    "internal waves were excited in a laboratory tank with sizes of @xmath0 filled with a stratified fluid .",
    "stratification is formed by dependence of water saltiness on height . the liquid density in the tank varied with height only by 4% .",
    "therefore , it is possible to term this stratification as a weak one . the composite experimental equipment including two lasers has allowed to watch very small - scale density fluctuations originated owing to vortex destruction in the stratified fluid and to discover many details of the effect under study .",
    "observation of small - scale structures had been based on dependence of refraction index of light on liquid density .",
    "mcewan has discovered and studied different stages of evolution of wave breaking and mixing @xcite , @xcite : overturning , development of interliving microstructure , restoring of static stability . according to experiments @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the initial phase of evolution of a nonlinear wave finishes formation of tongues of more heavy liquid inside more light , and vice versa .",
    "further , the effect of overturning develops , and tongues disintegrate into waves of much smaller scales .",
    "the static stability is restored in course of time , but the fluid stratification becomes changed .",
    "let us discuss reasons of formation of tongues .",
    "the velocity field within a local vortex is inhomogeneous , and top speeds are achieved at some distance from the vortex center .",
    "it leads to formation of the tongue of a heavy liquid , permeating into strata of a light liquid , and of the tongue of a light fluid , permeating into strata of a heavy liquid .",
    "different fluid particles cover different path lengths for the same time , and difference of path lengths increases with time .",
    "if we neglect influence of gravity , such fluid movement within a vortex of an elliptic shape leads to distortion of isopycnic lines ( lines of equal density ) and to reeling of isopycnic lines onto an ellipse .",
    "the ellipse semiaxes are determined by distances from the vortex center up to particles having top speeds in the vortex .",
    "some thin layer structure in which stratums of light and heavy fluids are alternating is an outcome of local rotating fluid movement .",
    "imposed gravity field gives birth to wave processes , and it entails breaking down of the regular thin layer structure .",
    "so , we observe mixing of the fluid .    due to the phenomenon mechanism ,",
    "whatever weak the stratification would be , the density gradients will become arbitrary large with the course of time .",
    "therefore , when we start mathematical modeling of the phenomenon , it is natural to presume a solution of nonlinear fluid equations may be nonsmooth and may contain discontinuities .",
    "it seems to be of interest to study nondifferentiable , generalized solutions of hydrodynamic equations of a stratified incompressible fluid placed into a gravity field .",
    "further , the fluid is supposed to be an ideal one .",
    "estimates show that dissipative effects are important at late stages of evolution .",
    "therefore , the nondissipative problem is of certain interest . to be sure , taking into account of dissipative terms",
    "should increase solution smoothness .",
    "the smoothing action of dissipation is explained by inhibition of waves with scales smaller than some minimally possible scale dependent on dissipative constants . at numerical modeling ,",
    "the smoothing action of dissipation shows one s worth only if the grid step is less than the minimally possible scale .",
    "often it is not advantageous or impossible to increase resolution up to a minimally possible scale .",
    "it is one more argument for study of a nondissipative problem .",
    "processes of mixing in viscous two - layer @xmath1 fluids with unstable stratification were numerically explored in @xcite , @xcite ( see also the literature quoted there ) .",
    "authors for raising productivity of computations have utilized parallelizing of calculations .",
    "the present paper essentially differs from @xcite , @xcite because in mentioned papers the instability develops at the expense of unstable stratification ( a heavy liquid has been initially placed above a light one ) . in the present paper ,",
    "the stratification is continuous and stable ; but in time the instability develops in itself , that is , under other mechanism than in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the instability is shaped by an initial vortex as it occur in occur in experiments of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the problem under consideration is a two - dimensional one , and dissipative processes are not taken into account , excepting ( [ equationforf ] ) . as against the mentioned papers , we are interested not only in simulation outcomes , but also in substantiation of mathematical statement of the problem and in admissible numerical methods .",
    "it is explained by nontrivial items in the problem .",
    "researched questions are important for viscous liquid as well .",
    "monographies @xcite , @xcite , and papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite are dedicated to mathematical research of linear equations for small - amplitude internal waves . as for nonlinear euler equations for incompressible fluid , correctness of many problems is not proved yet @xcite .",
    "multimode approach @xcite , in a finite - mode model directly related to mcewan experiment demonstrates important role of nonlinear dispersion @xcite we study nonlinear equations and show that a system of euler equations is not enough for statement of a correct generalized problem in case of a stratified fluid .",
    "the effects of wave overturning and fluid mixing are simulated numerically .",
    "the study of dependence of phenomenon of vortex destructions on a stratification scale is another purpose of the research . by means of numerical experiments",
    ", we shall demonstrate the decreasing of overturning effects with diminution of stratification scale @xmath2 . on the contrary",
    ", the effect grows with increasing stratification scale @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , it have been discovered that if we take a limiting case when the fluid density is a constant , the effect of vortex destruction is absent .",
    "we suppose a fluid behavior is described by euler equations for an incompressible fluid @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the horizontal and vertical mass velocities of the fluid , @xmath8 is time , @xmath9 are the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively , @xmath10 is the free fall acceleration .",
    "it is supposed as well that the nonperturbed fluid is stratified in density exponentially : @xmath11 the chosen value of @xmath12 approximately corresponds to the one for mcewan s experiments @xcite , @xcite . in considered mcewan s experiments , the density stratification was linear , but the stratification scale was much greater than the size of the tank ; therefore , the linear and exponential stratifications are practically indiscernible .",
    "an exponential stratification is more convenient for mathematical research of the equations .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath13 at the boundary @xmath14 of the domain @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a normal line to the boundary . keeping in mind mcewan s experiments ,",
    "we take a rectangle with horizontal dimension @xmath18 and vertical dimension @xmath19 as the domain @xmath15 .",
    "one of tested methods of numerical integration of euler equations ( [ eulerequation1 ] ) was based on galerkin method @xcite .",
    "the solution was searched for as a series in terms of functions dependent on vertical coordinate @xmath20 and belonging to a complete orthogonal system of functions , the expansion coefficients were dependent on horizontal coordinate @xmath21 and time @xmath8 . from euler equations , by known recipe we have deduced the equations for expansion coefficients @xcite .",
    "we term these equations as a set of equations for wave modes .",
    "the set of equations for wave modes have been solved numerically , and then the velocity and density have been calculated using the series .    in such a way we successfully simulated an initial phase of evolution of the nonlinear wave , which was finished with formation of tongue of a heavy liquid inside a light one , and vice - versa .",
    "a typical scale of the tongues is about @xmath22 .",
    "formation of such tongues is ( observed ) watched in laboratory experiments as well . in laboratory experiments",
    ", these tongues further disintegrate into waves of very small scales .",
    "however , we have miscarried this effect , though formally it is possible to obtain solution of the problem for all time .",
    "in - depth study of the problem has given the discovery that it is impossible to simulate correctly the nonlinear process under study within the framework of a standard galerkin method .",
    "the reason is that partial derivatives do not exist for functions with discontinuities . in such cases",
    "we should search for the nondifferentiable solution as a generalized , nonclassical one . in 1954 ,",
    "lax , considering quasilinear equations , has shown that nonlinear equations admit definition of different , nonequivalent classes of generalized solutions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is explained by the fact the main equations are crashed at discontinuity surfaces , so we need some additional conditions to match solutions on discontinuity surfaces .",
    "however , the conditions surface may be taken different , if we consider the question only from a mathematical standpoint . therefore , convergence and stability of the numerical method",
    "yet do not guarantee that an obtained generalized solution is valid from the physical point of view .",
    "moreover , only one of possible definitions of a generalized solution may fit the physical sense .",
    "sufficient conditions of physical validity of the generalized solution are not formulated yet , but necessary requirements are obvious . a generalized solution being adequate to the physical sense ,",
    "should meet the condition of conservation of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "the considered equations for incompressible fluid differ from surveyed by lax ( in what sense ) , but lax s argumentation is applicable to them as well .",
    "analysis has shown that the conventional galerkin method does not allow achieving simultaneous conservation of mass , momentum and energy for an obtained nondifferentiable solution .",
    "may be it is possible to correct somehow conventional galerkin method that would allow to simulate correctly solutions with discontinuities .",
    "however , the authors can not offer acceptable adjusting of a galerkin method . at the same time , finite - difference methods give major freedom that permits choosing a numerical scheme ensuring warranted realization of fundamental conservation laws .",
    "first , we remind how the theorems of existence , uniqueness and stability for linear problems are proved .",
    "ordinarily linear wave equations possess some quadratic functional conserved over solutions .",
    "this conserved quadratic functional is called a wave energy functional .",
    "for example , if we linearize equations ( [ eulerequation1 ] ) with respect to a background density , we come to known equations of the theory of small - amplitude internal waves for which the law of wave energy conservation is ( particular in @xcite ) : @xmath23 \\ , \\ , d \\,\\omega      \\label{hlinear}\\ ] ] here the function @xmath24 is defined by the formula @xmath25 . in ( [ hlinear ] ) the term containing velocities means a kinetic energy , and the term containing @xmath26 is a potential energy .",
    "functional ( [ hlinear ] ) is of great importance in mathematical theory of equations for small - amplitude waves : proofs of theorems of existence , uniqueness , stability for the linearized hydrodynamic equations essentially uses conservation of functional @xmath27 over solutions .",
    "the linearized fluid equations also possess other conservative functional of energy @xmath28 \\ , \\ , d \\,\\omega      \\label{linearhydrodynamicenergy1}\\ ] ] we will name this functional a functional of hydrodynamic energy @xcite . in ( [ linearhydrodynamicenergy1 ] ) , the term containing velocities means the kinetic energy and the term containing @xmath29 is the potential energy .    here",
    "both conservative energy functionals are written to underline their distinction .",
    "different formulas for energy functional are possible because energy is determined up to a constant . if we add any other conservative functional to the energy functional , we obtain a conservative functional again , which we may term an energy functional , but the expression for energy density becomes other . therefore , different formulas for energy functional exist .    we have selected the form of wave energy functional ( [ hlinear ] ) so that the energy to be zero at lack of waves . for this reason , functional ( [ hlinear ] ) is named wave energy functional . functional ( [ linearhydrodynamicenergy1 ] )",
    "is more known , but not possesses necessary mathematical properties .",
    "having the purpose to develop a theory for nonlinear equations , it is naturally to extend wave energy functional ( [ hlinear ] ) to nonlinear case .",
    "the following theorem is valid .",
    "let a solution to equations ( [ eulerequation1 ] ) be differentiable .",
    "then the functional @xmath30 \\ , \\ , d",
    "\\,\\omega \\qquad \\label{nonlimearenergy}\\ ] ] is conserved on solutions .",
    "the integrand in ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) is strictly non - negative at @xmath31 .",
    "the functional ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) turns into the functional ( [ hlinear ] ) , when we take the small - amplitude limit .",
    "conservation of the functional ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) follows the fact that it is the sum of conservative functionals of the hydrodynamic energy @xmath32 , of the mass @xmath33 , and of the conservative functionals @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "nonnegativity of the term @xmath37 is obvious at @xmath38 . to prove nonnegativity of remaining summands of the integrand",
    ", we consider @xmath39 we substitute @xmath40 . to be sure , the requirement @xmath41 is equivalent to @xmath42 . for derivative with respect to variable @xmath43",
    ", it is valid : @xmath44 unique minimum of the function @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "it is enough to be convinced that in the limit of small - amplitude waves the functional under study turns into ( [ hlinear ] ) .",
    "we term the functional ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) as a generalized functional of wave energy because in a small - amplitude limit it turns into wave energy functional ( [ hlinear ] ) for linearized equations . at lack of wave disturbances , the integrand in [ nonlimearenergy ] ) is equal zero .",
    "the idea of functional ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) form , is taken from the hamilton formalism explained in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , nonnegativity of the integrand , also some other important mathematical properties of the functional are discovered anew .",
    "let us generalize ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) to a case when a solution may be nondifferentiable .",
    "the functionals of mass and hydrodynamic energy from which the functional is constructed ( [ nonlimearenergy ] ) , should be conserved for nondifferentiable solutions ; it follows from their physical sense",
    ". however the functional + @xmath47 \\ , \\ , d \\,\\omega $ ] is not conserved in a case if the density field is nondifferentiable .",
    "therefore , we demand that the following inequality have to be fulfilled @xmath48    the sign `` @xmath49 '' is chosen because the sign `` @xmath50 '' in ( [ energydissipation ] ) leads to an unstable problem",
