    "davies , walsh , & booth  ( 1976 ) established that the observed diameter of , the compact source in the galactic center , scales as @xmath16 , as expected if interstellar scattering from microstructure in the electron density determines the observed diameter .",
    "the observed diameter of  is now known to scale as @xmath16 from 30  cm to 3  mm ( @xcite ) and to be anisotropic at least over the wavelength range 21  cm to 7  mm ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "maser spots in oh / ir stars within 25  of  also show enhanced , anisotropic angular broadening ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observations indicate that a region of enhanced scattering with an angular extent of at least 25  in radius ( 60  pc at 8.5  kpc ) is along the line of sight to . at 1",
    "ghz the level of angular broadening produced by this scattering region is roughly 10 times greater than that predicted by a recent model for the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy ( @xcite , hereinafter tc93 ) , even though this model includes a general enhancement of scattering toward the inner galaxy .",
    "these observations do not constrain the _ radial _ location of the scattering region for the following reason : all previous observations have been of sources in or near the galactic center , and for such sources , a region of moderate scattering located far from the galactic center can produce angular broadening equivalent to that from a region of intense scattering located close to the galactic center .",
    "previous estimates for the location of the scattering region have ranged from  10  pc to  3  kpc .",
    "ozernoi & shisov  ( 1977 ) concluded that an `` unrealistic '' level of turbulence is implied unless the region is within 10  pc of the galactic center .",
    "the level of turbulence they considered unrealistic , however , namely @xmath17 , does appear to occur elsewhere in the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) .",

    "( 1992 ) used the free - free absorption toward  to constrain the region s distance from the galatic center to the range 0.853  kpc , though suitable adjustment of free parameters ( outer scale and electron temperature ) can decrease the limit to 0.03  kpc .",
    "we shall refer to the case in which the region is a site of extreme scattering , @xmath18  pc from the galactic center and presumably caused by processes occurring there , as the gc model .",
    "we shall refer to the case in which the region is far from the gc , @xmath19  kpc and a site of enhanced but not extreme scattering , as the random superposition ( rs ) model .",
    "although the gc model is attractive for phenomenological reasons , other sites of enhanced interstellar scattering are found throughout the galaxy ( e.g. , ngc  6634 , @xcite ; cyg  x-3 , @xcite ) and the mean free path for encountering such a region is approximately 8  kpc ( @xcite ) .    identifying the location of the scattering is important in establishing the origin of the scattering . associating the scattering with a specific region",
    "may elucidate the mechanism for the generation of the density fluctuations responsible for the scattering .",
    "the currently favored mechanism is that velocity or magnetic field fluctuations  or both  generate the density fluctuations ( @xcite , 1986 ; montgomery , brown , & matthaeus  1987 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . velocity or magnetic field fluctuations",
    "are also a natural means for inducing anisotropy in the density fluctuations and thereby in the scattering disks .",
    "if this mechanism is correct , the amplitude of the density fluctuations may provide a measure of the coupling between the density and velocity or magnetic field fluctuations or , more generally , provide information about the small - scale velocity or magnetic field in the scattering region .",
    "however , current observational constraints are uncertain by the ratio of the galactic center - scattering region distance to the galactic center - sun distance . in the rs model ,",
    "the ratio is a few while in the gc model the ratio could be as large as one hundred , so the location of the scattering region is a key free parameter .",
    "the location of the scattering region also has implications for pulsar searches toward the .",
    "cordes & lazio  ( 1997 ) showed that even if the rs model is correct , pulsars seen through the scattering region will suffer pulse broadening of at least 5  s at 1  ghz ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the gc model is correct , only at frequencies above 10  ghz will pulsations be detectable ( because of the @xmath20 dependence of pulse broadening ) and then only for pulsars with periods longer than 100  ms .    in this paper",
    "we develop a likelihood analysis to quantify the most probable @xmath1 for the scattering region . in  [ sec : gc.model ] we describe our model for the distribution of free electrons in the . in  [ sec : likefunc ] we assemble measurements from the literature relevant to radio - wave scattering and develop a likelihood method to constrain the properties of the scattering region , and in  [ sec : gc.conclude ] we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the tc93 model synthesized scattering measurements of pulsars , masers , and extragalactic sources and dispersion measurements of pulsars with independently known distances .",
    "this model for the global distribution of free electrons in the galaxy does not include the enhanced scattering toward the gc , though tc93 acknowledged its existence and recognized this deficiency in the model .",
    "their model underpredicts the angular broadening of  and nearby sources by about a factor of 10 at 1  ghz . in this section",
    "we augment the tc93 model by considering the distribution of free electrons in the gc ( see also  [ sec : tcmodel ] ) .    for the gc region ,",
    "the simplest model is one that can account for the following :    1 .",
    "comparable , large angular broadening of  and oh / ir masers to at least about 30  away from  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 2 .   strong free - free emission and absorption within the sgr  a complex extending to approximately 5  from ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 3 .   weak free - free emission and absorption over a wider region , of order 10 , that includes the oh / ir masers ( @xcite ) ; and 4 .",
    "free - free absorption of  at frequencies below about 0.9  ghz with an optical depth of unity in the frequency range 0.81  ghz ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to account for these observations with the simplest model , we consider thermal free electrons distributed in two main components : ( 1 ) a central spheroid of radius @xmath21 centered on , and ( 2 ) a screen at distance @xmath1 from .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ] shows other geometries for the scattering region that may be appropriate for the gc model ; we can approximate the scattering region by a screen because of the weighting factor @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the galactic center - sun distance ( see below ) . in the gc model , the portion of the scattering region closest to the earth",

    "there is a wealth of observational data available for the .",
    "we shall summarize those conclusions relevant to our study here ; interested readers are referred to a number of recent reviews  genzel , hollenbach , & townes  ( 1994 ) ; morris & serabyn  ( 1996 ) ; and gredel  ( 1996)and references within .",
    "our criteria for the host medium of the density fluctuations are that the medium must have a sufficient density and that it must be capable of sustaining density fluctuations of the requisite magnitude .",
    "we establish our first criterion by estimating @xmath43 from the scattering diameters of gc sources using equations  ( [ eqn : measures ] ) and  ( [ eqn : smweight ] ) . the diameters of  and the oh masers require a weighted scattering measure of @xmath255  , equation  ( [ eqn : smweight ] ) .",
    "eliminating sm between equations  ( [ eqn : measures ] ) and  ( [ eqn : smweight ] ) and solving for @xmath43 yields @xmath256    two factors could alter this estimate by about an order of magnitude .",
    "first , it is likely that @xmath257  pc , which would _ reduce _ our estimate of @xmath43 .",
    "second , as we noted in  [ sec : gc.global ] , the similarity between the values of @xmath1 and @xmath10 suggests that the density fluctuations fill the region and @xmath258 .",
    "however , we might also associate @xmath4 with the characteristic size of a scattering cloudlet within the region .",
    "if the region contains few such cloudlets and @xmath259 , then @xmath260 , and our estimate above would be a considerable _ underestimate_. yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 1994 ) estimated that a typical line of sight might intersect only 10 or so scattering cloudlets .",
    "our second criterion for the host medium is that it must be able to support density fluctuations of the required magnitude .",
    "this constraint has been lucidly reviewed by spangler  ( 1991 ) : the density fluctuations are presumed to arise from plasma turbulence .",
    "as this turbulence dissipates , it can not heat the host medium at a rate that exceeds the medium s cooling capacity .",
    "this constraint is particularly acute in the situation we are proposing as the dissipation mechanisms considered by spangler  ( 1991 ) scale as @xmath263 with @xmath264 .",
    "since we are considering @xmath265  pc , the heating rates could be excessive .",
    "the dominant damping mechanisms for @xmath265  pc are linear landau damping , ion - neutral collisions , and a parametric decay instability .",
    "the first two mechanisms scale as @xmath266 while the latter scales as @xmath267 .",
    "in addition to their dependence on @xmath4 , the damping rates depend on the large scale magnetic field , @xmath268 ; the alfvn wave speed , @xmath269 ; and the amplitude of the magnetic fluctuations , @xmath270 for linear landau damping and ion - neutral collisions while @xmath271 for the parametric decay instability .",
    "linear landau damping also depends upon the angle of propagation with respect to the direction of @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and the plasma @xmath274 . for values of these quantities appropriate for scattering regions in the galactic disk ,",
    "these damping mechanisms produce volumetric heating rates of @xmath275@xmath276  erg  s@xmath277  @xmath14 . as spangler  ( 1991 ) discussed , there are also a number of simplifications and additional assumptions which enter the calculation of these heating rates .    inferred magnetic field strengths in the gc are @xmath278  mg , or @xmath279 that of the field strength in the disk .",
    "to estimate @xmath280 , we use ( cordes , clegg , & simonetti  1990 ) @xmath281 with @xmath282 for linear processes and @xmath283 for non - linear processes like the parametric decay instability .",
    "our first criterion for the host medium is that @xmath284 . for definiteness , and to provide the largest possible value of the heating ,",
    "we take @xmath285 .",
    "finally , although @xmath286 is much larger in the gc than in the galactic disk , @xmath287 is also larger . as a result @xmath269 is larger than in the disk , but probably by no more than an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath288 in the gc to be about a factor of @xmath11 larger that in the galactic disk .",
    "the heating rate from linear landau damping in scattering regions in the galactic disk ( @xcite ) assumes the density fluctuations arise from obliquely propagating magnetosonic waves ( @xmath289 ) .",
    "more aligned propagation results in less damping .",
    "it is not clear if the gc environment would favor highly aligned propagation or not .",
    "the large values of @xmath286 in the gc are inferred , in part , from the system of non - thermal filaments and threads seen throughout the . with only one exception ,",
    "these filaments have no kinks or bends in them , even though they are observed to be interacting with molecular clouds having typical velocities of 10100  km  s@xmath277 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this rigidity could be an indication that only highly aligned propagation is allowed .",
    "if @xmath273 is highly concentrated near 0 , then the heating from linear landau damping would be unimportant and the heating rates could be two orders of magnitude lower than those quoted above . alternately , as spangler  ( 1991 ) noted , the distribution of @xmath273 could be isotropic , but waves with large @xmath273 would then damp quickly and the heating rate will be unchanged or even larger than what we assume .",
    "the presence of small - scale ( @xmath290  pc ) magnetoionic cloudlets in the gc has already been inferred to explain large changes in the faraday rotation measure of certain features ( g  359.1@xmath4100.2 , the `` snake , '' @xcite ; g  359.54@xmath420.18 , the non - thermal filaments , yusef - zadeh , wardle , & parastaran  1997 ) , though the inferred density in these cloudlets , 0.310  @xmath14 , is less than our nominal estimate . in the galactic disk",
    "a small body of observational evidence suggests that the magnetoionic medium responsible for faraday rotation is also responsible for scattering and pulsar dispersion ( @xcite ; lazio , spangler , & cordes  1990 ; @xcite ) , and the same may be true in the .",
    "we now consider two models for the host medium . in both models ,",
    "the scattering arises in thin layers on the surfaces of molecular clouds . even if the filling factor , @xmath44 , of these layers is not large , the _ covering factor _",

    "are smaller regions of much higher electron densities , @xmath293@xmath179  @xmath14 , primarily within sgr  a west and sgr  b2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these high density regions are the photoionized surfaces ( size @xmath294  pc ) of molecular clouds ( @xmath295  @xmath14 ) irradiated by the ambient radiation field ( effective temperature @xmath296  k ) .",

    "( 1995 ) suggested that the magnetoionic medium responsible for the faraday rotation toward g  359.1@xmath4100.2 also results from these molecular clouds .",
    "this model suffers from at least three potential difficulties .",
    "first , the molecular skins are photoionized by a radiation field having a temperature of @xmath297  .",
    "our constraint on @xmath231 therefore requires @xmath298  pc .",
    "this value is considerably smaller than that derived by yusef - zadeh et al .",

    "however , in deriving their value for @xmath4 , yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used a value of the ionizing flux appropriate to the inner few parsecs .",
    "the stellar density decreases as @xmath299 , so outside the inner few parsecs , the ionizing flux should be lower than that assumed by yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "a lower ionizing flux would result in a smaller skin depth and bring their estimate and our estimate of @xmath4 into better agreement .",
    "a second potential difficulty with this model is that the medium would only barely be capable of cooling itself .",
    "if the outer scale is @xmath300  pc , then the heating rate from the damping of the plasma turbulence is @xmath301@xmath302  erg  @xmath14  s@xmath277 .",
    "the cooling capacity of gas near @xmath303  k depends sensitively upon the fractional ionization and temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate that a density of @xmath304  @xmath14 is required for these skins to be able to cool sufficiently in order to support the density fluctuations .",
    "this density is at the upper end of the range @xmath279@xmath179  @xmath14 inferred for the small - scale regions . in determining the cooling function of the medium , we have used results that assume a solar abundance .",
    "the metallicity in the gc could be as much as twice solar , leading to an increased cooling efficiency .",
    "the third difficulty is that the required value for @xmath4 in this model , @xmath305  cm , is considerably smaller than that in the galactic disk . in the galactic disk ,",
    "a stringent lower limit on the outer scale is @xmath306  cm , and it may be as large as @xmath307  cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the physics for the generation and maintenance of small - scale density fluctuations is not well understood , we regard it as potentially troublesome that this model predicts such a small @xmath4 .",
    "x - ray observations have revealed a central , diffuse x - ray source with a ( fwhm ) size of @xmath308 ( @xcite ) .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggested that this x - ray emitting gas may be responsible for the scattering .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : delne ] ) . however , this gas appears spatially coincident with the central zone of intense molecular emission and presumably abuts cooler gas in the clouds .",
    "we modify frail et al.s  ( 1994 ) proposal by identifying the interfaces where the gc molecular clouds are exposed to this ambient hot medium as the source of the scattering .",
    "we term these interfaces `` warm '' by analogy with mckee & ostriker s  ( 1977 ) model for the . in that model",

    "still , the outer scale remains an order of magnitude smaller than its lower limit in the galactic disk .",
    "one point in favor of this model is the distribution of the x - ray emitting gas as compared to that of the molecular clouds .",
    "the size of the x - ray emitting region is similar to the extent of the scattering region , approximately 1 .",
    "in contrast , the molecular cloud distribution extends over the range @xmath324 .",
    "if the scattering traced massive stars within these molecular clouds , as the photoionized molecular cloud skins model suggests , the scattering should extend further in longitude than it does . in this respect , the lack of enhanced scattering for h@xmath69omasers in sgr  b is particularly problematic .",

    "can not be supported in media with @xmath12  k , a position with both theoretical and limited observational support ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , recent vlbi observations of 5 pulsars show no evidence for an enhanced level of turbulence at the boundary of the local bubble ( @xcite ; britton , gwinn , & ojeda  1996 ) , potentially a local analog of an interface between a hot and cooler medium .",
