    "in the context of multiple stellar populations , ngc2808 and @xmath0cen are certainly two of the most intriguing objects .",
    "the cmd of ngc 2808 shows three main sequences ( mss ) , with middle and blue ms being highly helium enhanced up to @xmath10.39 with respect to the red ms which has primordial helium ( dantona et al .",
    "2005 , piotto et al .  2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopic studies have revealed significant star - to - star variations in the light - element abundances with the presence of an extreme na - o anticorrelation ( e.g. norris 1981 , carretta et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the observational scenario for @xmath0cen is even more complex .",
    "photometry shows a multimodal ms ( bedin et al .",
    "2004 , bellini et al .",
    "2010 ) , which imply extreme helium enhancement ( dantona et al .",
    "2004 , norris et al .",
    "2004 ) . at odds with most globulars , which have homogeneous iron abundance ,",
    "its stars span a wide interval of metallicity and define a multimodal distribution in [ fe / h ] , and @xmath2-elements .",
    "large star - to - star light elements variations , na - o and c - n anticorrelations are present within each metallicity interval ( e.g.  marino et al .  2011 ) .",
    "photometry of globular - cluster sequences extended to date over a limited spectral region , from the ultra - violet ( uv , @xmath3 2000 ) to the near - infrared ( nir , @xmath3 8000 ) . as such , multiple sequences are rarely detected along the lower part of the ms , because observational limits make it hard to get high - accuracy photometry of very faint and red stars in optical and uv colors . in the following we use",
    "_ hst _ to extend the study to the nir passbands and investigate multiple sequences in ngc2808 and @xmath0cen over a wide interval of stellar masses , from the turn off down to very low - mass ms stars ( @xmath40.2@xmath5 ) .",
    "figure  1a shows the nir cmd for ngc2808 from milone et al .",
    "( 2012a , left panel ) and @xmath0cen ( right panel ) .",
    "the upper ms of ngc2808 is consistent with three stellar populations with different helium and light - element abundance , in agreement with previous observations based on visual photometry .",
    "the three mss merge together at the luminosity of the ms bend while at fainter magnitudes , at least two mss can be identified . a bluer , more populated @xmath6 , which includes @xmath7% of ms stars , and a @xmath8 with @xmath9% of stars .",
    "the fractions of stars along @xmath6 , and @xmath8 are very similar to the fraction of red - ms stars ( @xmath1062% ) and the total fraction of middle - ms and blu - ms stars ( @xmath1024 + 14=38% , milone et al .",
    "2012b ) .",
    "the observed cmd of ngc2808 has been compared with appropriate evolutionary models for very low - mass stars and synthetic spectra that account for the chemical composition of the three stellar populations of this clusters ( see milone et al .",
    "2012a for details ) .",
    "it comes out that @xmath6 is associated with the first stellar generation , which has primordial he , and o - c - rich / n - poor stars , and that @xmath8 , corresponds to a second - generation stellar population that is enriched in he and n and depleted in c and o. the @xmath6 of fig .",
    "1a is the faint counterpart of the red ms identified by piotto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , whereas the @xmath8 corresponds to the lower - mass counterpart of the middle ms and blue ms of piotto et al .",
    "the brightest part of the cmd of @xmath0cen in fig .",
    "1b shows that the blue and the red ms , already detected in previous papers , merge together at the magnitude of the ms bend . at fainter luminosities",
    ", it appears a broad ms with a blue , more populated component ( @xmath6 ) , and a red tail ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the similarities with ngc2808 , make it very tempting to associate the @xmath6 and the @xmath8 to the red and the blue ms , respectively .",
    "a comparison of the cmd with stellar models and synthetic spectra that account for the complex chemical composition of @xmath0cen stellar populations is mandatory to clarify this issue .",
    "these results provide the first detection of multiple populations with different helium and light - element abundances among very low - mass stars .",
    "the fact that the signatures of abundance anticorrelation are also observed among fully - convective m - dwarfs definitely demonstrates that they have primordial origin and hence correspond to different stellar generations .",
