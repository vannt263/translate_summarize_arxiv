    "the rapid development of spin - orbital physics and quantum information in recent years motivates the search for the realizations of intrinsically frustrated orbital ( or pseudospin ) interactions .",
    "such interactions lead to radically different behavior from heisenberg su(2 ) isotropic exchange , and have been in the focus of very active research in recent years .",
    "it was realized that the quantum nature of orbital degrees of freedom , that may be released by emerging spin - orbital coupling and spin - orbital entanglement , is interdisciplinary and plays a crucial role in the fields of strongly correlated electrons @xcite and cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the strong frustration of spin - orbital interactions can be best understood by considering generic orbital models , in which the bond - directional interactions provide the building blocks . among them ,",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) compass model defined on a square lattice @xcite and the kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite can be treated as two quintessential pseudospin models , where the effective moments can not simultaneously align to satisfy interactions with all neighbors as they favor the quantum states with distinct quantization axes .",
    "in fact , the latter model is a rare example of an interacting 2d spin model that can be rigorously solved , and was found to support gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids with emergent fractional excitations obeying non - abelian statistics . otherwise",
    ", exact solutions for 2d models with frustrated exchange exist only for classical ising interactions where a phase transition at finite temperature is found @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that also for the 2d compass model a phase transition to nematic order occurs at finite but much lower temperature @xcite .    in low - dimensional magnetic systems collective quantum phenomena",
    "are particularly strong since the reduced dimensionality amplifies the consequences of frustrated interactions between individual spins . to probe the exotic phases resulting from bond - directional interactions , we introduced a one - dimensional ( 1d ) generalized compass model ( gcm ) with antiferromagnetic exchange alternating between even and odd bonds @xcite .",
    "such a model may be realized in layered structures of transition metal oxides , with alternating exchange interactions along the bonds parallel to @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes along a zigzag chain in an @xmath4 plane @xcite , optical lattices @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and coupled photonic cavities @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the community focuses on two - body interactions in most systems studied , as they contribute to superexchange and are readily accessible experimentally .",
    "however , the range of the hybridization of the electron wave function will be finite in some realistic bonding geometries , and the effect of such long - range interactions must be addressed .    recently",
    "three - site interactions received considerable attention in a bit diverse context @xcite .",
    "they also occur in an effective spin model in a magnetic field obtained from a 1d plaquette orbital model by an exact transformation , with spin dimers that replace plaquettes .",
    "indeed , they are coupled along the chain by three - spin interactions in the hilbert space reduced by a factor of 2 per plaquette @xcite .",
