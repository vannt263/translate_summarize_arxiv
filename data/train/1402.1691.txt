    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite for the derivation of a dynamical system to study the interaction of an ion with an obliquely propagating wave composed of a transverse and longitudinal component . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the electromagnetic wave is composed of a transverse component along the @xmath3 plane and a longitudinal component along the @xmath4 direction superposed onto a background magnetic field @xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane : @xmath7 @xmath8 we write the longitudinal component as a function of parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 as follows : @xmath11 the parameter @xmath9 quantify the amplitude of the longitudinal component of the wave with respect to the electromagnetic component . setting @xmath12 would therefore result in having equal electric field amplitudes parallel and perpendicular to the wave vector * k*. setting @xmath13 recovers the case treated in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is a phase difference between the longitudinal component and the transverse component .",
    "it is added for the sake of completeness .",
    "the dynamical system equation is therefore not fundamentally modified .",
    "the difference reside in the addition of an electric field component along the @xmath14 component of the lorentz force .",
    "it is easy to show that the dynamical system takes the following form @xcite ( see appendix for detailed derivation of the purely transverse case ) : @xmath15 for the dynamical gyrofrequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 , relativistic momentum @xmath18 , refractive index @xmath19 , phase - speed @xmath20 and dots indicating time derivatives .",
    "the time evolution of the dynamical gyrofrequency can then be written as : @xmath21 we can now proceed by studying the dynamical system properties in terms of the fixed points and their stability as well as the dependence on wave parameters such as wave obliquity @xmath0 and normalized wave amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "more importantly we would like to know whether the surfatron acceleration mechanism , the processes by which a particle is trapped along the wave vector and accelerated uniformly along the background magnetic field by the parallel electric field @xcite , is also available when a longitudinal component is added .",
    "the surfatron is a trapping effect , and is therefore only achievable if a parallel electric field of sufficiently large amplitude is present .",
    "if the propagation of the wave is parallel , the parallel electric field is zero , and neither trapping along the wave vector nor acceleration along the background magnetic field is possible .",
    "we therefore assume that the longitudinal component can for various parameters either enhance or destroy the surfatron . +",
    "a quick look at the dynamical system ( [ eq : ds_in_ps2 ] ) shows that the fixed point for the electromagnetic case ( @xmath23 ) exist for @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    "no fixed points exist .",
    "hence , one would expect the acceleration mechanisms associated with hopf - hopf bifurcation to be available for sufficiently large wave amplitude capable of trapping when @xmath24 .",
    "whenever @xmath25 , one can think of the longitudinal component as a perturbation to uniformly accelerated particles ( orbits ) .",
    "hence , particles ( orbits ) could still be energized but the longitudinal component could break the locking eventually . additionally , if the longitudinal component of the wave , for given parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , cancels the parallel component of the electric field with respect to the background magnetic field due to the electromagnetic component , no uniform acceleration should take place .",
    "this condition can be written as follows : @xmath26 setting @xmath24 , one finds that this condition translates to @xmath27 for which neither trapping nor uniform acceleration should be possible .",
    "we therefore expect the lack of a parallel electric field component to translate into unstable orbits for linear perturbation around the fixed points . in the next section",
    "we apply the stability analysis to the dynamical system ( [ eq : ds_in_ps2 ] ) for the fixed point ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we now proceed similarly as for the electromagnetic case @xcite to quantify the linear stability of the fixed point . in order to do",
    "so we linearize the dynamical system and assume a perturbation of the form @xmath28 , for which an imaginary eigenvalue translates into marginally stable orbits , negative eigenvalues into linearly stable orbits , and positive eigenvalues linearly into unstable orbits . computing the resulting jacobian evaluated at the fixed point @xmath29 for the longitudinal case we find the following matrix",
    ": :    @xmath30 a little algebra results in the following bi - quadratic expression : @xmath31 with the values @xmath32 and @xmath33 given by the following expressions : @xmath34 one can compare the jacobian matrix as well the characteristic equation for the purely electromagnetic case with the expressions above for an additional longitudinal component with @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that minimal differences arises as denoted in the appearance of a factor of @xmath9 in the jacobian and the characteristic equation .",
    "the characteristic equation has once again four roots given by the following equation : @xmath35 figure ( [ eig2 ] ) shows the dependence of all four eigenvalue solutions for typical parameters relevant to space plasmas on the propagation angle .",
    "it is clear that the hopf - hopf bifurcation takes place once again for parameters resulting in @xmath36 .",
    "that is , whenever parameters are such that @xmath37 , the fixed point evolves from marginally stable to linearly unstable when we add a longitudinal component with @xmath38 .",
    "additionally , a second bifurcation takes place when @xmath27 . setting @xmath27 in the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 results in the following characteristic equation : @xmath39 . with @xmath40 for @xmath41 ,",
    "it is clear that two eigenvalues are null and two eigenvalues are imaginary .",
    "as noted in the previous section , this expression denotes a null parallel electric field resulting in the destructive interference of the parallel longitudinal component and the parallel electromagnetic component .",
    "we now investigate the nonlinear effects of the longitudinal components on the surfatron process for various parameters @xmath9 and @xmath42 .      in this section",
    "we determine whether the addition of the longitudinal component enhances or prevents the uniform acceleration for orbits caught in the basin of attraction centered at landau resonance .",
    "as noted in the stability analysis , a hopf - hopf bifurcation does indeed take place when a longitudinal component is added .",
    "the main difference in the linear stability around the fixed points resides in the addition of a parallel electric field capable of canceling the electromagnetic component parallel to the background field .",
    "hence , whenever @xmath27 , the parallel component of the electric field is zero and the surfatron process can not take place . indeed , choosing the parameter @xmath9 to coincide with @xmath43 results in destroying the hopf - hopf bifurcation to a single hopf bifurcation ( one pair of imaginary eigenvalues crossing the real plane instead of two pairs ) .",
    "for such parameter the surfatron process is expected to not be applicable because a parallel electric field causing the uniform acceleration is now set to a null value .",
    "+ figure ( [ electro_trapped ] ) shows two orbits for @xmath44 ( on the right panel ) and @xmath45 ( on the left panel ) .",
    "a transition from untrapped to trapped orbit is observed as we evolve the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath46 the particle located sufficiently close to the fixed point ( landau resonant velocity ) is trapped , but small perturbation results in untrapped orbits .",
    "+ in figures ( [ electro_surf ] ) , the four panels represent a seeded particle with energy of the order of @xmath47 kev but for @xmath48(up and left ) , @xmath49(up and right ) , @xmath50(down and left ) and @xmath51(down and right ) .",
    "the particle gains a maximum amount of energy for @xmath50 , which corresponds to a propagation angle close to @xmath52 and to the surfatron process .",
    "the longitudinal component for parameters @xmath53 enhances the parallel electric field component and results in smaller range of values in @xmath22 for which the surfatron process is accessible . in this case",
    "the ratio @xmath54 is of the order of @xmath55 .",
    "this order of magnitude for the electromagnetic wave component is comparable to large - amplitude bursty waves observed in the radiation belts @xcite .",
    "+ however , before concluding that the longitudinal component preserves the surfatron mechanism for @xmath56 we need to evaluate the effects of the phase difference @xmath10 . in the figures ( [ electro_surf ] ) the parameter",
    "@xmath10 has been set to zero . yet , when @xmath25 , the dynamical system possesses no fixed points and the acceleration observed for the surfatron process should not arise uniformly .",
    "panels in figure ( [ effectpsy ] ) show particles for @xmath57 and three different values for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is seen that depending on the phase difference , the surfatron process can still take take place for sufficiently long time to energize the particle .",
    "as for the purely electromagnetic case , a charged particle in this field would gain a significant amount of energy ( from kev levels to mev ) on small kinetic time scales @xmath60 .",
    "hence a particle can be energized in such a field on time scales of the order of the @xmath61 of a second for a wave frequency @xmath62khz .",
    "since the acceleration takes place on very small time scales , inhomogeneous effects should not prevent the mechanism entirely .",
    "we therefore conclude this section by suggesting that the large - amplitude electromagnetic waves observed in the radiation belts can energize particles efficiently on kinetic time scales for propagation angles close to the critical hopf - hopf bifurcation value @xmath52 .",
    "if the propagation angle is not sufficiently close to @xmath52 , then the particle will just oscillate back and forth in the potential of the electric field and no significant gain in energy should be observed .",
    "we now proceed in the next section by quantifying the inhomogeneous effects on the surfatron herein described .",
    "in this section we want to include the effects of a non - homogeneous magnetic field on the acceleration process described in the previous section .",
    "we first discuss the motion of a particle in an inhomogeneous magnetic field with no wave - particle interaction .",
    "we then provide an approximation for the time scales for which inhomogeneous effects can result in surfatron breaking and a discussion on numerical integration of a particle trajectory interacting with a large - amplitude electromagnetic wave in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "relativistic electrons trapped in the radiation belts bounce back and forth along the ( approximately ) dipolar magnetic field of the earth . before addressing the more complicated motion of relativistic electrons bouncing back and forth in the earth s magnetic field and at the same time interacting with an obliquely propagating wave",
    ", we would like to quantify the impact of the magnetic field inhomogeneities on the relativistic motion . assuming the magnetic moment : @xmath63 is an adiabatic invariant",
    ", we can derive the forces due to the magnetic field inhomogeneities as follows .",
    "+ the magnetic force perpendicular to the magnetic field can be deduced from the conservation of the magnetic moment : @xmath64 replacing @xmath65 in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , we find the following expression for the force perpendicular to the magnetic field : @xmath69 using the above equation and assuming that the energy of the particle is conserved to first order in @xmath65 for a particle moving in an inhomogeneous magnetic field , we can write : @xmath70 therefore , the equation of motion in the parallel direction can be written as : @xmath71 setting @xmath72 in equations ( [ p_para_inhomo ] ) and ( [ p_perp_inhomo ] ) recovers the expressions for non - relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "we can show that similarly to the non - relativistic case , the conservation of magnetic moment results in magnetic trapping .",
    "assuming a slab geometry for the magnetic field as shown in ( [ topology3 ] ) for @xmath73 , i.e. the component along the parallel coordinate , and the magnetic field of the form @xmath74 to mimic the dipolar field , for which @xmath75 is equal to the earth s radius , we can solve both equations ( [ p_para_inhomo ] ) and ( [ p_perp_inhomo ] ) .",
    "hence , replacing the expression for @xmath76 in ( [ p_para_inhomo ] ) , results in the following equation : @xmath77 the solution of the above equation is therefore of the form @xmath78 . replacing the expression for the magnetic field in equation ( [ p_perp_inhomo ] ) for the perpendicular momentum , we find the following differential : @xmath79 with a perpendicular momentum solution @xmath80 replacing the solution for @xmath81 in the above equation provides for a complete solution for the particle motion in the inhomogeneous field @xmath74 .",
    "we see that the particle oscillates back and forth along the parallel direction , while the perpendicular momentum increases as the particle reaches regions of larger magnetic field strength corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "numerous effects can cause the breaking of the surfatron process : dispersive wave - effects , dissipation of the wave amplitude , inhomogeneous magnetic fields damping the acceleration along the field line , or simply the result of precipitation into the atmosphere . because of the slow time - scales upon which the surfatron process becomes interesting to sustain particle precipitation , and since other effects would take place on longer time - scales , we now focus solely on the inhomogeneous effect .",
    "that is , we want to obtain time scales for which the surfatron would not be prevented by field inhomogeneities .",
    "+ the surfatron results in the parallel acceleration of a particle caused by the parallel component of the electric field . as demonstrated in the previous section",
    ", magnetic field inhomogeneities result in a @xmath83 force that can reduce the surfatron process , in the same way that the parallel electric field from a longitudinal component can prevent parallel acceleration .",
    "hence , when @xmath84 parallel acceleration becomes marginal .",
    "this condition translates as follows : @xmath85 for the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the gyrofrequency @xmath88 as well as the pitch - angle @xmath89 and lorentz factor @xmath90 of the particle at the equatorial region . setting @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 km , @xmath94 for a particle with an initial energy of the order of @xmath47 kev and pitch - angle of @xmath95",
    ", we find @xmath96 km .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that a particle would gain energy of the order of @xmath97 , which corresponds to a gain in energy of the order of 100 kev for an electron interacting with an electric field of @xmath47 mv / m .",
    "this approximation is comparable to energization of electrons reported by @xcite who found gains of the order of @xmath98 kev for particles going through several landau resonance in an inhomogeneous field .",
    "the difference with our result hereafter , however , is that the particle gains energy during the time of one landau resonance , making the process much more efficient , even though less probable .",
    "+ we now write a dynamical system for a relativistic charged particle interacting with an obliquely propagating wave in an inhomogeneous field . in order to make the set of equations more transparent to the reader we write them in a coordinate axis for which @xmath99 , that is the background magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath14-axis .",
    "we denote @xmath100 and @xmath101 . rewriting the magnetic field in terms of this coordinate system",
    "we obtain :    @xmath102    and similarly , using faraday s laws , we obtain the following components for the electric field :    @xmath103    for the phase @xmath104 .",
    "we choose the background magnetic field to be written as @xmath105 , for the function @xmath106 and its partial derivative with respect to @xmath14 , @xmath107 , denoting the background magnetic field variation as the particle propagates toward along the field line and away from the equatorial region @xmath108 .",
    "we can then write the dynamical system in terms of the variables ( @xmath109 ) and the functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112 and @xmath113 we then proceed by normalizing the variables as follows : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and write the dynamical system in terms of the normalized variables @xmath119 and the parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 as previously defined .",
    "@xmath122    we can now integrate this dynamical system for parameters relevant to radiation belt electrons with large - amplitude obliquely propagating waves to study the surfatron process in an inhomogeneous magnetic field mimicking the earth s magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ gradb_gamma ] show orbits for parameters @xmath123=0.01 , @xmath124=0.33@xmath125 , @xmath126=0.1 and @xmath0=71.9@xmath127 .",
    "the left panel shows the perpendicular component of momentum @xmath128 against the perpendicular position @xmath129 .",
    "the right panel shows the parallel component of momentum @xmath130 against the parallel position @xmath131 .",
    "initially the parallel component of momentum increases because of surfatron , until the @xmath132 force becomes strong to break the trapping due to the parallel electric field .",
    "the particle gains energy of the order of 76kev during the process .",
    "this gain in energy is of similar order ( @xmath133100kev ) as the one computed above for a simple balance of forces .",
    "even though this gain appears modest , it should be kept in mind that it takes place on a time scale of the order of @xmath134@xmath13312 , hence @xmath135@xmath13310ms for a wave frequency @xmath136@xmath1333khz .",
    "as the surfatron acceleration is lost , the conservation of the adiabatic invariant leads to a transfer of energy from the parallel direction to the perpendicular as noted by the continuous increase of the perpendicular momentum for @xmath134@xmath13712 .",
    "since the gain in energy is irreversible , the particle uplifted by tens of kev can only oscillate back and forth in the potential of the wave and transfer energy along the perpendicular or parallel direction to preserve adiabatic invariance .",
    "this point is clearly demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ gradb_gamma ] . as the particle is uniformly accelerated , @xmath138 increases .",
    "once the surfatron is broken , the particle resides in a state of higher energy .",
    "the left panel of the figure shows the three - dimensional orbit in velocity space @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 . for @xmath134@xmath14212",
    ", the particle is uniformly accelerated through the surfatron process along the parallel direction .",
    "once the surfatron is made inoperable , the magnetic field gradient dictates the particle orbits and conservation of @xmath65 leads to transfer of energy to the perpendicular direction . as denoted by the left panel of fig .",
    "[ gradb_gamma ] , the gyroradius of the particle increases ( @xmath143@xmath144@xmath145 ) as the particle comes out of the surfatron .    even though the surfatron accelerates particles parallel to the magnetic field , the inhomogeneous field results in redistributing the energy perpendicularly to the magnetic field .",
    "hence , such a process , if statistically common in the radiation belts , could provide for an explanation to anisotropic distribution resulting in whistler wave turbulence without the need to resort to cyclotron resonance .",
    "indeed , both resonant and nonresonant electron whistler instabilities require an initial anisotropy with @xmath146 , the perpendicular kinetic energy density , to exceed @xmath147 , the parallel kinetic energy density by a certain amount .",
    "as the waves are being triggered by the instability and @xmath148 reaching marginal stability levels , particles in the tail can be accelerated through the surfatron , travel toward a region of larger magnetic field and gain greater gyroradius , bounce back to equatorial region and contribute to the breaking of the marginal stability state of the whistler turbulence .",
    "this back and forth mechanism could then be stopped by precipitating the particles in the atmosphere , instead of having them bounce back toward the equatorial region .",
    "we extended a previous theoretical study @xcite of nonlinear wave - particle interactions for the study of electrons in radiation belts by including longitudinal wave effects and inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "we found that , similarly than for the electromagnetic case in a uniform background field , the acceleration of particles along the background magnetic field , for propagation angles in close proximity to a critical propagation @xmath52 and associated with a hopf ",
    "hopf bifurcation condition , can arise on sufficiently small timescales to be of relevance to radiation belt dynamics . even though longitudinal wave components and inhomogeneous magnetic fields can limit the surfatron acceleration of electrons in radiation belts , gains in energy of the order of 100kev , taking place on timescales of the order of 10ms , are sufficiently strong for the mechanism to sustain efficient particle energization .",
    "future studies will investigate the effect of wave obliquity and field inhomogeneities on electron distribution functions for parameters consistent with radiation belt dynamics .",
    "our starting point is the relativistic lorentz equation for the motion of a particle in an electromagnetic field .",
    "the force is therefore written as      for a particle of momentum @xmath150 , rest mass @xmath151 and charge @xmath152 .",
    "the lorentz contraction factor @xmath138 is defined as follows : @xmath153 in order to avoid dealing with both the velocity and the momentum in the dynamical system , we simply write the equations in terms of the more physically relevant quantity between the two , that is the relativistic momentum @xmath154 : @xmath155}\\ ] ] similarly , the lorentz factor can be written as follows : @xmath156 the electromagnetic field is superposed onto a background magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath157 @xmath8 the electromagnetic wave vector points in the @xmath4 direction and the background magnetic field lies in the @xmath158 plane .",
    "@xmath159 @xmath160 where @xmath161 faraday s law , expressed in terms of the fourier components gives the relation between the components of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "@xmath162 the electric force is therefore written as @xmath163 for which @xmath164 is the phase velocity . taking the cross product of the momentum and the magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetic force is written as @xmath165 we can write the dynamical system equations in terms of the following variables : @xmath166 ; @xmath167 ; @xmath168 , which results in the following equations : @xmath169 in the classical case we have @xmath170 equations to integrate , the three components of the velocity plus the position coordinate along * k*. in the relativistic case , for a non zero propagation angle , the energy of the particle is not a constant of the motion , that is , @xmath171 .",
    "hence , we can think of the relativistic dynamical system as composed of 4 equations , the three components of the momentum plus the position coordinate along * k * , and one constraint relating @xmath138 and the momentum components . without any loss of generality we take the constraint into consideration by writing an equation for the dynamical gyrofrequency : @xmath172 if we define the constant @xmath173 , it is straightforward to see that @xmath174 since @xmath175 , the time evolution of this quantity is written as : @xmath176 we can now eliminate the explicit time dependence of the equations by making a transformation of variables . even though this transformation corresponds to a translation in the wave frame for low phase - speed of the wave ( @xmath177 ) , it does not correspond to a physical frame of reference for phase - speeds similar to the speed of light @xmath178 .",
    "and @xmath179 are lorentz transformations in the wave frame , but because we do not also transform the time component into the wave frame ( @xmath180 , the dynamical system does not correspond to a particle orbit in the wave frame for relativistic regimes . ]",
    "the explicit time dependence can therefore be eliminated by the following change of variables : @xmath181 for the lorentz factor : @xmath182 we can then write the equations of motion in terms of the new variables as follows ; @xmath183 if we absorb the lorentz factor @xmath184 into @xmath185 and @xmath186 , that is , we write @xmath187 and @xmath188 , and write @xmath189 in terms of @xmath190 , we can write the dynamical system as follows : @xmath191 with the refractive index @xmath192 .",
    "the magnitude of the momentum is now written as @xmath193 , hence the lorentz contraction factor also transforms from @xmath194 .",

    "<S> recent theoretical studies of the nonlinear wave - particle interactions for relativistic particles have shown that landau resonant orbits could be efficiently accelerated along the mean background magnetic field for propagation angles @xmath0 in close proximity to a critical propagation @xmath1 associated with a hopf  </S>",
    "<S> hopf bifurcation condition . in this report </S>",
    "<S> , we extend previous studies to reach greater modeling capacities for the study of electrons in radiation belts by including longitudinal wave effects and inhomogeneous magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even though both effects can limit the surfatron acceleration of electrons in radiation belts , gains in energy of the order of 100kev , taking place on the order of ten milliseconds , are sufficiently strong for the mechanism to be relevant to radiation belt dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the following report aims at extending a theoretical model for wave - particle coherent interaction @xcite to characterize electron dynamics in the earth s radiation belts . </S>",
    "<S> electrons with energies in the mev range have been frequently measured in the inner and outer component of the radiation belt . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in relativistic electron flux observed for short time scales ( from few hours to few days ) and in correlation with an increase of magnetic activity during the recovery phase of geomagnetic substorms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not only relativistic electrons constitute a threat to satellites and spacecrafts in orbit , but their production has to be understood in order to account for the magnetospheric energy budget . thus far </S>",
    "<S> , numerous theoretical models have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> they can be grouped into two categories : mechanisms relying on radial transport alone as well as those that rely on internal mechanisms such as wave - particle interactions and recirculation models ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and reference therein , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> radial transport is often described as a diffusion mechanism driven by the fluctuations in the large scale magnetosphere electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> as the particles spread from the outer magnetosphere to smaller equatorial radial distances , @xmath2 , the first two adiabatic invariants are conserved while the third one is violated , resulting in an increase of energy @xcite . on the other hand , local wave - particle interactions , and other local mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> accelerate particles already present in the inner magnetosphere . even though it is accepted that radial diffusion is an important transport mechanism , particle energization on time scales shorter than the drift period predicted by radial diffusion has lead to hold wave - particle interaction responsible for a number of observables . </S>",
    "<S> events occurring on time scale of days are believed to originate from electromagnetic cyclotron waves and whistler waves through pitch angle scattering , whereas the more intense and monochromatic chorus waves are believed to be the source of the strong energy increase occurring on the shortest time scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , observations of peaks of phase space density , in contradiction with inward radial diffusion , have shown that wave - particle interactions are dominant mechanisms @xcite .    aside from the outstanding problem of flux enhancement of relativistic electrons in the radiation belt , wave - particle interaction could also be proven to hold a decisive role in a number of other magnetospheric problems . among them </S>",
    "<S> lies the generation of relativistic electron microbursts observed in association with vlf chorus waves @xcite as well as precipitation rates of electrons entering the loss cone in pitch angle .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps more importantly , the most recent waveforms measured in the radiation belts have revealed additional motivating reasons to consider the wave - particle interaction as a dominating energy - momentum exchange mechanism in radiation belt problems . </S>",
    "<S> large - amplitude , monochromatic , obliquely propagating , and bursty waveforms were not only repeatedly measured in the radiation belt @xcite , but appeared correlated with electron energization @xcite as well as relativistic microbursts events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between chorus waves and electron energization in the radiation belts is not recent , but it is suspected that if such waveforms were more commonly present in the radiation belts they could be the dominant trigger responsible for the energization of electrons on short timescales . </S>",
    "<S> a study by @xcite has shown that if one solves the plasma equations self - consistently , such waveforms were indeed capable of accelerating electrons on kinetic time scales consistent with the observations . even though our study lacks the levels of self - consistency provided by the numerical method developed by @xcite , we will show hereafter that we arrive at similar conclusions if we choose parameters consistent with the radiation belt - measured waveforms .    </S>",
    "<S> the large - amplitude wave forms are observed with a longitudinal component and the analysis above needs to be conducted with the addition of this compressive electric component . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the addition of the electrostatic field with the same phase as the electromagnetic components of the fields would result in the same condition for the surfatron process , a difference in phase would shift the hopf bifurcation and have non - trivial effects that need to be scrutinized . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , radiation belt electrons are confined in the magnetic field of the earth , and one must take into account the effect of field inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore proceed in this in this report by modifying a previously derived dynamical system @xcite to allow a study of relativistic electrons in radiation belts . </S>"
