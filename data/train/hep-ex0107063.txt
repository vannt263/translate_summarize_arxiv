    "the study of parton interactions is frequently hindered by the fact that outgoing quarks and gluons can not be observed directly .",
    "photons , however , referred to as `` prompt photons '' , can emerge as a primary product of hard parton processes without the hadronisation by which quarks and gluons form jets . in this way",
    ", they provide information that is relatively free from hadronisation uncertainties .",
    "this talk summarises two recent analyses by zeus at hera@xcite , which present measurements of prompt photon cross sections in photoproduction .",
    "prompt photons are measured in the zeus barrel calorimeter .",
    "the fine - grained , pointing geometry of the electromagnetic section allows photons to be distinguished from @xmath0 and @xmath1 backgrounds by first removing those candidates consisting of a broad cluster of fired cells . a statistical subtraction",
    "is then performed as a function of the fraction of the energy in the highest - energy cell .",
    "an isolation condition removes further background , and reduces the contribution from photons radiated from final - state quarks .",
    "the integrated @xmath2 luminosity was @xmath3 pb@xmath4 , with @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev . the analysis employed energy - flow objects which combine information from calorimeter cells and measured tracks .",
    "the incoming virtual photon energy was estimated using @xmath7 = summing over all energy - flow objects in the event , each treated as equivalent to a massless particle . after correcting for energy losses , limits on @xmath7",
    "were applied , corresponding to limits on the centre - of - mass @xmath8 energy @xmath9 .",
    "events with a scattered beam positron in the calorimeter were rejected both explicitly and by the upper limit on @xmath7 .",
    "jets were reconstructed , using energy - flow objects , by means of the lorentz - invariant @xmath10-clustering algorithm ktclus in the inclusive mode .",
    "the momenta of the objects comprising the jet were summed to obtain the total jet - momentum vector .",
    "an energy correction was applied .    after correction",
    ", the photons and jets were respectively required to have @xmath11 gev with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 gev with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the laboratory pseudorapidity .",
    "the fraction of the incoming photon energy that takes part in the qcd subprocess was estimated as @xmath16 summing over the high - energy photon and the jet .",
    "figure 1 shows the inclusive prompt photon cross section as a function of @xmath17 . the magnitude is approximately described by pythia ; herwig is lower due to a smaller radiative contribution .",
    "the nlo parton - level calculations give a fair description .",
    "however at negative @xmath17 , all the models are low .",
    "the shape of the @xmath18 distribution is well described by each model .",
    "there are important contributions from the direct and resolved processes , and also from radiative processes .",
    "the recent fgh calculation@xcite , still at the parton level , contains the nlo terms in lg and also a box diagram term that is included in k&z .",
    "it is a slight improvement , but again fails to account fully for the backward cross section .",
    "varying the effective transverse momentum of the partons in the proton has been investigated , and seems unable to generate the effect .",
    "as shown below , there is no significant discrepancy when a jet is included in the cross section definition ; it is therefore worth asking whether the processes which give a very forward - backward event need special theoretical treatment . a recent",
    "calculation@xcite predicts a bfkl contribution of a suitable magnitude , namely @xmath19 pb , but with no backward peaking .",
    "it will be of interest to see whether the ccfm approach@xcite can assist .",
    "figure 2 shows the distributions in @xmath20 and @xmath17 obtained when a jet is demanded .",
    "the strong peak near unity in @xmath20 is due to events in which the `` direct photoproduction '' process dominates . in photoproduction at leading order ,",
    "the compton process @xmath21 is the only direct prompt photon process .",
    "the distributions are well described by pythia ( c.f .",
    "1a ) , giving no suggestion for large errors in the photon pdfs .",
    "the condition @xmath22 selects events due mainly to the direct compton process , and little affected by the incoming photon s hadronic structure . in these events ,",
    "the transverse momentum  of the prompt photon perpendicular to the jet direction in the @xmath23 plane is sensitive to the momentum of the quarks in the proton , as is the azimuthal angle between the prompt photon and the jet ( cf .",
    "the normalised distribution of  was used to fit the pythia parameter @xmath24 , the so - called `` intrinsic '' parton momentum in the proton .",
    "a good fit is obtained ( fig .",
    "3 ) . by combining @xmath24 with the effects of the initial - state parton showers",
    ", it is possible to obtain an overall value for the effective transverse momentum of the partons in the proton .",
    "the result is @xmath25 , as shown in fig .",
    "3c in comparison with data from a variety of other experiments .",
    "the zeus result is consistent with the trend shown by all the measurements , namely that the value of  rises with hadronic interaction energy .",
    "this may be attributed to the effects of initial - state gluon radiation , but a full theoretical description is still awaited .",
