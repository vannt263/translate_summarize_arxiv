    "recently , there has been great progress in compact laser systems , with dramatic improvements in both laser power and peak intensity .",
    "ion acceleration by laser pulses has proved to be very useful in applications using compact laser systems .",
    "laser - driven fast ions are expected to be useful in many applications such as hadron therapy , @xcite fast ignition for thermonuclear fusion , @xcite laser - driven heavy ion colliders , @xcite and other applications that use the high - energy ions .",
    "although the achieved proton energy at present is not high enough for some applications such as hadron therapy , which requires 200-mev protons , other methods can be considered for generating higher energy protons .",
    "one simple way is by using a higher power laser .",
    "however , current power capabilities of compact lasers are insufficient ; moreover , laser power enhancement will result in a cost increase of the accelerator .",
    "therefore , it is important to study conditions for generating higher energy protons with lower laser power and energy by using some special techniques .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , i show a way to obtain @xmath3-mev protons by using a laser pulse whose intensity is @xmath5 w/@xmath2 , energy is @xmath6 j , and power is @xmath7 tw .",
    "i use three - dimensional ( 3d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to investigate how high - energy , high - quality protons can be generated by a several - hundred - terawatt laser .",
    "i study the proton acceleration during the interaction of the laser pulse with a double - layer target composed of a high-@xmath8 atom layer coated with a hydrogen layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig01 ] ) . as suggested in refs . and",
    ", a quasimonoenergetic ion beam can be obtained using targets of this type .",
    "our aim is to obtain a high - energy ( @xmath9 mev ) and high - quality ( @xmath10 ) proton beam using a relatively moderate power laser .    in the following sections ,",
    "i show the dependence of the proton energy on the material of the first layer and that the high - energy protons can be generated by optimally combining a couple of ion acceleration schemes .",
    "i consider ion acceleration by a charged disk .",
    "the charged disk is produced by a laser pulse with sufficiently high intensity irradiating a thin foil .",
    "many electrons are driven from the foil by the laser pulse , although the ions of the foils almost stay at their initial positions because they are much heavier than the electrons .",
    "therefore , the thin foil will have a charge , which induces an electrostatic field .",
    "ions located on the foil surface are accelerated by this electric field .",
    "the @xmath11 component of the electric field of a positively charged thin disk is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the charge density , @xmath14 is the disk thickness , @xmath15 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath16 is the charged disk radius .",
    "i assume that the @xmath11 axis is normal to the disk surface placed at the disk center .",
    "the solid curve in fig . [ fig : fig01 ] shows this electric field .",
    "the ions , i.e. protons , are accelerated in this electric field , although it rapidly decreases as a function of distance from the target surface .",
    "the electric field decreases to @xmath17 at @xmath18 , which is the distance equal to the diameter of the target and can be considered to be the spot size of a laser pulse .",
    "therefore , generating higher energy protons requires producing a higher surface charge density , @xmath19 , or increasing @xmath16 .",
    "the former requires a higher intensity laser and the latter requires a higher power laser . the rapidly decreasing accelerating field and its narrow width lead to inefficient proton acceleration by the charged disk .",
    "in this paper , i present ways to improve these inefficiences and to generate high - energy protons effectively .    here , let us define the some terms . in laser ion acceleration ,",
    "the ions are accelerated in some electric field , @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that for an ion of mass of @xmath21 and charge @xmath22 , the force on it from the electric field is @xmath23 .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ion velocity .",
    "this equation can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the resistance to movement of an ion in a certain electric field , @xmath20 ; therefore we call @xmath28 `` mass '' in this paper .",
    "this expression shows that the smaller @xmath28 ions can experience greater acceleration in a certain electric field , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , small-``mass '' ions will be called `` light , '' and big-``mass '' ions will be called `` heavy . '' ions of the same `` mass '' undergo the same movement in a certain electric field .",
    "note that @xmath28 is equal to the inverse of the well - known parameter @xmath29 , the charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "i use @xmath28 in this paper because it makes it very simple and easy to image the movement of charged particles in an electric field .",
    "component of the electric field , @xmath30 , is normalized by its maximum , @xmath31 , of an electrically charged disk on the @xmath11 axis ( solid curve ) .",
    "protons are accelerated in this electric field .",
    ", width=377 ]    figure [ fig : fig01 ] shows that the accelerating protons exit the electric field in a short time .",
    "this means that the electric field produced is not used enough for proton acceleration .",
    "therefore , we should create a situation in which the protons experience this electric field longer for efficient acceleration .",
    "if the electric potential moves in the direction of the moving protons , the protons will experience the electric field longer .",
    "in other words , the charged first layer keeps pushing the moving protons .",
    "i present two ways to create this situation .     in the direction of laser propagation by rpda .",
    "the electric potential moves in the @xmath11 direction as a result of these effects .",
    ", width=377 ]    one way this situation can be created by the use of a coulomb explosion of the first layer .",
    "figure [ fig : fig02 ] shows that the first layer disk undergoes a strongly inhomogeneous expansion owing to the coulomb explosion .",
    "this expansion raises the moving electric potential for the accelerating protons . in other words ,",
    "many ions in the first layer are distributed close to the accelerating protons keeping a comparatively high density and move in the proton direction .",
    "the acceleration rate is higher when the expansion velocity of the first layer ions is higher .",
    "this means that the strong coulomb expansion operates effectively for proton acceleration .",
    "the coulomb explosion level is determined by the `` mass '' of the ions composing the first layer .",
    "equation ( [ emv ] ) shows that `` light '' ions have a high expansion velocity .",
    "that is , `` light '' ions undergo a stronger a coulomb explosion and should be generating higher energy protons .",
    "another way to induce movement of the first layer is by radiation - pressure - dominant acceleration ( rpda ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig02 ] shows that the first layer , which expands by a coulomb explosion ( with an ellipsoidal light pattern ) , is moving with velocity @xmath32 in the laser propagation direction ( proton direction ) by rpda .",
    "this movement leads the moving electric potential .",
    "higher @xmath32 values generate higher energy protons , since the protons experience the accelerating electric field over a longer time by following the electric potential .",
    "a portion of the energy and momentum transferred from the laser pulse to the electrons is imparted to the ions via a charge separation field .",
    "that is , the ions get accelerated by this field , and the `` light '' ions have higher velocity ( eq .",
    "( [ emv ] ) ) .",
    "thus the `` light '' ions experience a higher first layer velocity and should be generating higher energy protons .",
    "one can obtain higher energy protons by using a `` light '' material in the first layer , as is corroborated by the simulations described below .",
    "the simulations were performed with a 3d massively parallel electromagnetic code , based on the pic method .",
    "in this section , i study the dependence of the proton energy on the first layer materials of the double - layer target by using simulations .      here , i show the parameters used in the simulations .",
    "the spatial coordinates are normalized by the laser wavelength @xmath33 @xmath34 m and time is measured in terms of the laser period , @xmath35 .",
    "i use an idealized model , in which a gaussian linearly polarized laser pulse is incident on a double - layer target represented by a collisionless plasma .",
    "the laser pulse with dimensionless amplitude @xmath36 , which corresponds to a laser peak intensity of @xmath1 w/@xmath2 , is @xmath37 long in the propagation direction , @xmath38 fs in duration , and focused to a spot with size @xmath39 ( fwhm ) , which corresponds to a laser peak power of @xmath40 tw and a laser energy of @xmath0 j. here , the laser peak power is calculated by using @xmath41 and the laser energy is calculated by using @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the laser intensity . the laser pulse is normally incident on the target .",
    "the electric field is oriented in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "i use this laser pulse in all simulations in this paper .",
    "both layers of the double - layer target are shaped as disks .",
    "the first layer has a diameter of @xmath45 and a thickness of @xmath46 .",
    "the second , hydrogen , layer is narrower and thinner ; its diameter is @xmath39 and its thickness is @xmath47 .",
    "the electron density inside the first layer is @xmath48 @xmath49 and inside the hydrogen layer it is @xmath50 @xmath49 .",

    "correspondingly , the simulation box size is @xmath55 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the particles and for the fields are periodic in the transverse ( @xmath54,@xmath8 ) directions and absorbing at the boundaries of the computation box along the @xmath53 axis .",
    "@xmath56 coordinates are used in the text and figures ; the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the rear surface of the initial first layer , and the directions of the @xmath11 , @xmath44 , and @xmath57 axes are the same as those of the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath8 axes , respectively .",

    "we see that the carbon ions are distributed over a much wider area by its coulomb explosion than are the gold ions . however , the deformation of the laser pulse is similar in both cases at all times .",
    "the coulomb explosion process of the first layer is much slower than the laser pulse progress .",
    "the first layer is almost undeformed at @xmath63 when the laser pulse is just around the target and it has the strong interactions with the target .",
    "a big deformation of the first layer appears at @xmath64 when the laser pulse passes through or reflects from the target .",
    "therefore , the explosion of the first layer is an almost simple coulomb explosion without other effects .",
    "the proton energy obtained in the carbon case is much higher than that in the gold case .",

    "the distribution area of the carbon ion cloud is very wide and it moves in the @xmath11 direction .",
    ", width=302 ]    the reason why higher energy protons are obtained in the carbon case is that the first layer deformation effectively contributes to the proton acceleration .",
    "let us examine the deformation of the first layer .",
    "figure [ fig : fig04 ] shows a cross section of the ion density distribution near the @xmath69 plane at @xmath65 , as seen by looking along the @xmath57 axis . in the carbon case , the strong coulomb explosion distributes the carbon ions ellipsoidally , and the distribution area is much wider than in the gold case .",
    "the expansion of the cloud of carbon ions is strongly inhomogeneous and it appears to be substantially elongated in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the surface of the carbon ion cloud is close to the acceleration protons , which means that the protons keep getting pushed by a comparatively strong force .",
    "moreover , the center point of the ion cloud is moving in the @xmath11 direction , at a coordinate of @xmath70 , so that the electrostatic potential is moving in the direction of the protons .",

    "moreover , the proton positions in the carbon case have travelled further along the @xmath11 axis than in the gold case , since the protons in the carbon case have higher energy ( higher velocity ) than in the gold case .     versus time , as obtained in the simulation shown in figs .",

    "the protons are accelerated relatively quickly until a time of about @xmath72 in both cases . in the gold case",
    ", the acceleration almost saturates at @xmath73 , although in the carbon case it is still increasing compared with the gold case .",
    "this is because the electric field seen by protons in the carbon case is greater and continues longer than in the gold case , owing to the expansion and movement of first layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig04 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , their energy gain is also greater . in the carbon case",
    "the proton energy is 1.7 times higher than in the gold case and the energy spread is almost the same in the both cases , as seen in fig .",

    "i evaluate this contribution by simulation . in this case , even if we put the second layer of thin hydrogen on the hydrogen first layer , the second layer has no meaning .",

    "the hydrogen disk target has the same shape and size as that of the first layer of the double - layer target used previously .",

    "the target velocity rises rapidly at the initial time , @xmath86 when the laser pulse is still around the target and the velocity is constant at time @xmath87 after the laser pulse passes through or reflects off of the target .",
    "this is similar to the carbon case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig09 ] ) , although the target velocity of this case is @xmath159 times that in the carbon case at time @xmath64 .",
    "that means strong rpda appears in this case , because the target velocity is attributable to rpda .",
    "the movement of the target is much greater than in the carbon case too . in the hydrogen disk target",
    ", the protons are accelerated more efficiently than in the carbon case , because hydrogen is much `` lighter '' than carbon .    because i used the same laser pulse in all simulations ,",
    "the numbers of electrons pushed out from the target are estimated to be almost the same in carbon and hydrogen disk cases at the initial simulation time .",
    "therefore , the target surface charge is almost the same in the two cases , and the proton energy by the charged disk electric field can be estimated using the same considerations as in section [ sim - b ] , yielding @xmath120 mev .",
    "therefore , we can estimate that the proton energy by rpda and coulomb explosion is @xmath160165 mev .",

    "the shutter must have high enough accuracy and the ability to shield unwanted particles and radiation .",
    "the shutter speed must be very fast near the target .",
    "the accuracy becomes coarser if the shutter position moves to a position farther from the target , because the distance between the high - energy protons and the low - energy protons grows in time .",
    "it may be difficult to construct a shutter that satisfies both the timing accuracy and shielding ability , however , we could get a similar result by using a magnet and a slit .",
    "the path of a proton is changed for each energy level by a magnetic field , and high - energy protons can be taken out by passing through a slit .",

    "this proton beam has high enough energy and quality for some applications ( e.g. , in medical applications ) .",
    "proton acceleration driven by a laser pulse irradiating a disk target is investigated with the help of 3d pic simulations .",
    "i have found higher energy protons are obtained by using `` light '' materials for the target . as seen in simulations , for these materials a strongly inhomogeneous expansion of the disk target occurs owing to the coulomb explosion , which plays an important role , and rpda has a strong effect .",
    "the time - varying electric potential of the inhomogeneous expanding ion cloud and the movement of the ion cloud for the protons efficiently accelerate protons . the proton beam energy can be substantially increased by using a `` light '' material for the target . in our simulations ,",
    "the laser intensity and energy , @xmath114 w/@xmath2 and @xmath115 j , are not enough to reach the rpda regime in full scale , but the rpda regime has a big effect even at this laser power level .",
    "although i show simulation results by using a simple hydrogen disk , it may be difficult to fabricate such a hydrogen disk ; a ch@xmath164 foil target with a high @xmath165 value should be a good substitute .",
