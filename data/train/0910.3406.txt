    "optical absorption spectra are a widely used and versatile tool for the characterization of the electronic properties of systems of interacting electrons , including their elementary excitations in condensed - matter systems as well as in molecules and clusters .",
    "the information that can be obtained from absorption and transmission spectra complements the information accessible from photoelectron spectroscopy techniques , but the interpretation is more difficult because transitions in the interacting system are probed , and the correlated dynamics of electrons and holes in the many - electron system has to be taken into account in order to compare with experiments and to identify spectral characteristics .    in a quasiparticle picture ,",
    "the photoabsorption is determined by the probability of an electronic transition from an occupied to an empty ( or virtual ) quasiparticle state , and can be directly determined from the electron - hole correlation function .",
    "the determination of the ele - tron - hole correlation function is numerically demanding and usually effected by time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) or by solving the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) integral equation derived in the framework of many - body perturbation theory  @xcite .    in the latter approach , the bs equation is often used at the level of a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , and a popular choice for the calculation of the the excited states , which are needed as input for the bs equation , is the gw approximation for the self - energy , i.e. , the effective interaction seen by one particle in the presence of the other carriers .",
    "( here , @xmath3 is the single - particle green function and @xmath4 the screened interaction . )    in the case of state - of - the - art bs equation approaches @xcite , which may be applied to extended and finite systems , the dft single - particle states are used as input to gw calculations to obtain the quasiparticle correction to the kohn - sham eigenvalues .",
    "then the equation for the electron - hole correlation is transformed into an eigenvalue problem , from which the real parts of the electron - hole transition energies are obtained .",
    "the numerical calculations needed for these bethe - salpeter approaches are simplified if one assumes an instantaneous , i.e. , statically screened , electron - hole interaction for the direct part of the integral kernel of the bs equation .",
    "this approach works well with quite a few extended systemes , such as semiconductors and insulators .",
    "the straightforward inclusion of the full dynamic screening in the bs equation complicates its numerical solution tremendously , but it is possible to perform an expansion of the dynamically screened potential in plasmonic modes  @xcite .",
    "dynamic screening is also responsible for excitonic effects even in metals , such as cu and ag  @xcite .",
    "general attacks on the problem of dynamic screening in the bs equation go back to the shindo approximation  @xcite .",
    "more recently this problem has been reexamined in the framework of nonequilibrium green function theory , which allows one to derive a dyson equation for the two - particle propagator  @xcite .",
    "in addition to standard bs equations there also exist explicitly time - dependent ( nonequilibrium ) green function based methods , which reduce to the bs equation at the gw - rpa level as a special case , but have been solved for simpler systems using more complicated two - particle correlations than those contained in the gw - rpa  @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that green function approaches going beyond the gw - rpa accurately determine the electronic energy renormalizations and broadening for collective excitations in extended systems  @xcite .    in finite systems , electronic states and electron - hole transitions contributing to the absorption spectra",
    "are discrete , and are explicitly treated as such in most green function based theories as well as configuration - interaction ( ci ) and td - dft calculations .",
    "however , the experimental signatures due to the discrete states and transition energies invariably appear with a finite linewidth in photoemission and absorption measurements , respectively , due to the finite detector energy - resolution . in particular , the bunching of levels and transitions in certain energy regions , which occurs with increasing system size , can not be resolved experimentally and may lead to structures that are much broader than the experimental resolution , so that the underlying contributions from individual states or transitions can not be distinguished .",
    "this is often accounted for by adding a phenomenological broadening , which is usually taken to be the same for all transitions .",
    "the approach of the present paper to the _ ab - initio _ calculation of absorption spectra in finite systems uses from the outset a finite broadening for single - particle states , i.e. , finite lifetimes , as it is rigorously only the case in extended systems .",
    "in addition to the background broadening , however , there result dynamical interaction - induced features in the absorption spectra , namely linewidths and energy shifts , which are closely connected  @xcite .",
    "we aim here at the consistent inclusion of both transition - energy renormalizations and finite linewidths due to ele - tron - hole correlations for finite systems .",
    "we achieve this by deriving an integral equation from a quantum kinetic description of the dynamic electron - hole coherences driven by an external , coherent optical field , including hartree - fock ( hf ) and scattering contributions .",
    "our approach is equivalent to an equation of the bs type for the _ complex _ electron - hole correlation function using the hf single - particle energies together with a _ frequency - dependent _ integral kernel , which contains correlation effects beyond the static hf contributions  @xcite .",
    "the finite linewidths in our absorption spectra exceed the `` background '' single - particle broadening and thus describe interaction induced effects including the formation of new peaks .",
    "the broadening in our approach should be distinguished from the artificial broadening in _ nonequilibrium _",
    "dynamics  @xcite .",
    "since we base our derivation on the dynamics of electron - hole coherences  @xcite in the interacting system , one can include self - energy effects and thus make the calculation self - consistent .",
    "an important property of the present approach is that it is straightforward to incorporate the requirement that the ( two - particle ) electron - hole correlation function be consistent with the electronic single - particle properties , so that a conserving approximation ( in the sense of baym and kadanoff ) results .",
    "this approach fulfils important sum rules by construction  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the f - sum rule for the density - density correlation , which can be read as the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule for the absorption cross section in finite systems , is directly checked in our numerical calculations .",
    "last , but not least , we point out that including correlation effects in a consistent way by examining the equations for electron - hole coherences makes the interdependence between one- and two - particle properties clear .",
    "this approach therefore avoids possible inconsistencies of a two - step procedure of calculating first the single - particle properties , and then solving a bs equation with an effective two - particle interaction , as it is done in state - of - the - art bs equation approaches .",
    "our approach to the _ ab - initio _ calculation of absorption spectra in finite systems is based on a recent development of a `` consistent '' gw theory for finite systems  @xcite , and it has been applied to extract structural information from cluster absorption spectra  @xcite . in the present paper , we are mainly concerned with a detailed discussion of the general method for computing absorption spectra .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the derivation of a `` one - shot '' calculational method using hartree - fock energies and a constant `` background '' broadening .",
    "this is appealing for its simplicity , and also because it preserves the distinction between hf and correlation contributions throughout the calculations .",
    "the present paper expands on the short discussion given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a few illustrative applications to small metal clusters , such as na@xmath0 , na@xmath1 and na@xmath2 , which exhibit rather complicated correlation mechanisms between the interacting electrons and which develop true collective excitations with increasing clusters size .",

    "however , because the core electron states are energetically well separated from the outermost shell , these states are only weakly mixed into the electronic states contributing to transitions in the energy window of interest , which is a few evs , and we expect that the core electrons only introduce an additional fine structure in the optical spectrum in that window . for the clusters investigated here , we therefore treat one active electon per na atom and use effective core potentials to describe the contribution of the core electrons .",

    "moreover , there may be different geometrical configurations with similar total energies , which may contribute to the experimental spectrum . for na@xmath88 , we are neither in the limit of a small nor a larger cluster so that there is a competition between the two trends : the spectral density of the single electron - hole transitions is not yet large enough as to yield featureless broadened peaks , but the number of the possible configurations with different electronic properties is large enough so that so that the cluster geometry present in the experiment is difficult to predict .",
    "finally we wish to point out that we have checked numerically that all the computed spectra shown fulfill the f - sum rule for finite systems to better than 99% @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the electron mass and @xmath107 is the total number of electrons in the system .",
    ".   is the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule for the absorption cross section and is a measure for the overall quality of the absorption spectrum .",
    "we have presented an approach to compute the absorption spectra for finite systems based on a linear response theory for the dynamical electron - hole coherences in the presence of an external field .",
    "using a quasiparticle ansatz in the quantum kinetic equation for the electron - hole coherence , which includes hf and scattering contributions , allows us to derive a bs equation for the electron - hole correlation function with a complex , frequency - dependent kernel .",
    "the latter is determined by the scattering ( or correlation ) contributions to the electron - hole coherence dynamics .",
    "one thus obtains absorption spectra that include level - shifts of transition energies and a broadening of the absorption peaks due to electronic interactions .",
    "the correlation induced shifts and the broadening are closely related since they are the result of the complex , frequency dependent kernel , and the broadening mimics the bunching of discrete levels in finite systems .",
    "we apply the method to three important na clusters : na@xmath97 and the magic number clusters na@xmath88 and na@xmath93 , and compare both the calculated resonance energies and the shape of the absorption lines with experimental results .",
