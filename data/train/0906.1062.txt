    "<S> if the position angle of interstellar polarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy , the deviation is larger than 25 % . </S>",
    "<S> the line polarization at the , and lines is also smaller at the later epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in the position angle across these lines , which were observed at the earlier epoch , are still marginally present at the later epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the similar polarimetric behavior suggests that the distributions of these ions are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> properties of polarization , as well as the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases , can be explained by an aspherical , possibly unipolar explosion of a wn star in which the blob of @xmath0ni  penetrates c+o core and stops within the he layer . </S>"
