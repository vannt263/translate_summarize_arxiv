    "there is strong numerical evidence that the dynamics of a flux tube formed between a heavy - quark and an antiquark is well described by the nambu - goto string in four spacetime dimensions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite for a review of the effective string approach to qcd flux tubes with a review of the results for the closed flux tubes ) . in particular , the ground - state energy of such a flux tube matches very well with the arvis formula for the ground - state energy of an open nambu - goto string with fixed end points in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "yet one expects on general grounds that there should be corrections to arvis formula , for after all , the qcd flux tube is not a one - dimensional object and has some `` intrinsic '' thickness that we expect to be related to the _ finite _ correlation length of the confining @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "if one thinks of the fluctuations in the intrinsic thickness as an additional degree of freedom , then integrating out this degree of freedom would lead to an effective string action .",
    "such an action , in general , should contain all possible terms consistent with reparameterization invariance . in the spirit of effective field theories",
    ", these terms can be organized into relevant , marginal and irrelevant terms ( for a review of these ideas see , for e.g , refs .",
    "the nambu - goto action is the only relevant term ; then there is a marginal term  the so - called extrinsic - curvature term  and infinitely many irrelevant terms corresponding to higher and higher derivatives of the string coordinates .",
    "further , since we are considering open strings , there could also be boundary terms .",
    "in fact , we know on very general grounds that the resulting effective string action can not be just the nambu - goto action @xcite .    to obtain an effective string action for qcd flux tubes  starting from the fundamental description in terms of quarks and gluons  we need to integrate out all the fluctuations of the gauge fields whose wavelength is less than the correlation length of the confining theory .",
    "this task is as difficult as deriving an effective chiral lagrangian for pions starting from the qcd action .",
    "the gauge / gravity duality @xcite , inspired by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , provides us with an alternate  though approximate and often heuristic  way of analyzing the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "specifically , it provides us with a geometrical way of exploring the consequences of one of the defining properties of @xmath3 gauge theories , namely the existence of a finite correlation length of the gauge fields . according to the gauge / gravity duality , a qcd flux tube should be thought of as a holographic projection of a fundamental string in five - dimensional curved space ( that may have more compact directions but they will not play a role in the present investigation . ) this picture then suggests that for confining gauge theories the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube can be related to the position of a fundamental string in the fifth dimension @xcite .",
    "it was also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that this relationship was consistent with the expected behavior of the intrinsic thickness of a nielsen - olesen - like flux tube with its string tension @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to use the geometrical picture provided by the gauge / gravity duality to delineate the various sources of correction to the heavy - quark potential as compared to the ground - state energy of a nambu - goto string in flat four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "these corrections are induced by the fact that the fundamental qcd string lives in a five - dimensional curved space .",
    "we will analyze this situation using the large-@xmath0 approximation , where @xmath1 is the number of dimensions of the flat spacetime where the quark lives .",
    "@xmath0 is therefore the number of directions transverse to a qcd flux tube .",
    "the main advantage that this approach offers is that it treats the massless modes of the string nonperturbatively .    in gauge / gravity duality ,",
    "the confining property of the boundary gauge theory is reflected in the fact that a fundamental string in five dimensions can minimize its energy by staying at a fixed value of its fifth coordinate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimal - surface ] .",
    "we first calculate the large-@xmath0 behavior of the fundamental string in the approximation where the fundamental string descends from its minimal energy value to the boundary right at @xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 , where the quark and the antiquark are placed .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : approxminsurface ] .",
    "the dynamics of the open string in this approximation is very much like that of an open string placed at a fixed value of the fifth coordinate and stretched between two d - branes .",
    "the leading term in the large-@xmath0 analysis for this case turns out to be nothing but the arvis formula . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : approximations ] , when one corrects for this approximation then the leading term in the large @xmath0 expansion is no longer the arvis formula alone . rather , the arvis formula gets modified by an overall factor that can be thought of as a length - dependent string tension .",
    "it is important to note that there should be corrections to the arvis formula even if the nambu - goto action by itself provided an exact description of qcd flux tubes @xcite .",
    "these expected corrections should arise from quantizing the nambu - goto string in noncritical dimensions .",
    "from the point of view of the large @xmath0 expansion such corrections should exist since the arvis formula is only the leading term in the large-@xmath0 expansion and there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the higher - order corrections should vanish .",
    "though we will not explore these higher - order corrections in our large-@xmath0 analysis , but it is interesting to note that these corrections should themselves be proportional to @xmath7 as they should vanish for the critical dimension of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , surprisingly the arvis formula gives the exact ground - state energy of a nambu - goto string in flat spacetime for @xmath9 and for @xmath10 .    in an alternative approach , pioneered in refs .",
    "@xcite , one starts with a derivative expansion for the action of a fundamental string stretched between two d - branes in five - dimensional confining background ; then one perturbatively integrates out the fluctuations corresponding to the oscillations in the fifth dimension .",
    "these world - sheet fluctuations are massive , and after integrating them out one obtains an effective action for the massless transverse fluctuations . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this leads to a correction to the arvis potential at the order of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the length of the fundamental string stretched between the two d - branes .",
    "this correction comes from a boundary term induced by integrating out the heavy modes . in another approach to boundary terms explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , one expands the boundary action in the derivatives of the massless transverse modes",
    ". the terms in this expansion are then constrained by the lorentz invariance of the underlying theory .",
    "in our large-@xmath0 analysis we do not see such a boundary term at least to the order of @xmath13 , but it is worth recalling that for the physical case of interest @xmath0 is equal to @xmath14 and therefore even @xmath15 correction can be important .",
    "what we do see is that the holographic description of qcd flux tubes leads to additional terms to the nambu - goto action that are non - zero only in the immediate vicinity of the quark and the antiquark , and we estimate their contribution to the heavy - quark potential .",
    "presumably , the effects of such terms can be approximated by introducing boundary terms in an effective string description of a qcd flux tube .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : large d ] , we consider a particular class of confining geometries and calculate the leading term in the large-@xmath0 expansion under the simplifying assumption that we discussed above .",
    "further , in this sec .",
    "we recast the large-@xmath0 analysis in terms of a `` master - field , '' which turns out to be very useful for a later analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1/d correction ] , within the same simplifying assumption , we calculate the @xmath13 correction arising from the fluctuation of the string in the fifth dimension that give rise to massive world - sheet modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : approximations ] , we make allowance for the fact that the fundamental string descends to the boundary smoothly over a transition region of finite length .",
    "this leads to an effective string description of the qcd flux tube in which the nambu - goto string action is supplemented by terms that have support only in the vicinity of the quark and the antiquark .",
    "we also estimate the contributions of these terms in the large-@xmath0 limit . in the final section we state our conclusions .",
    "the gauge - invariant observable of an @xmath3 gauge theory that is directly related to the heavy - quark potential is the wilson loop , @xmath16=\\mathrm{tr}\\mathrm{\\hat{\\mathrm{p}}}\\left(\\exp i\\int_{\\gamma}a\\right).\\label{eq : wilsonloop-1}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is a closed curve in four - dimensional euclidean space , and @xmath18 is the vector potential of the @xmath3 gauge theory @xcite . according to the assumed gauge / gravity duality , the expectation value of the wilson loop can be written as a sum over the world - sheets of an open string whose end points terminate on the loop @xmath17 .",

    "let us put the boundary at @xmath154 and evaluate this term for the classical configuration ( [ eq : minimalsurface ] ) @xmath155 where @xmath156 is regular at @xmath4 .",
    "placing the boundary of the five - dimensional space at @xmath154 instead of at @xmath26 is equivalent to introducing an ultraviolet cutoff in the boundary theory and the divergence of the last term corresponds to the linearly divergent contribution to the self - energy of the quark @xcite , @xmath157 from the flux tube point of view the divergence arises because near the quark and the antiquark the intrinsic thickness is going to zero and correspondingly the effective string tension diverges @xcite .",
    "thus , the main effect of the last term in ( [ eq : boundaryterms ] ) is just to renormalize the mass of the quark and the antiquark on which the string terminates , and we will therefore ignore it in the discussion below .    the second term in ( [ eq : boundaryterms ] ) is finite and represents a correction to the nambu - goto string in four dimensions",

    "( [ fig : theboundaryeffect ] ) and is , at least for our choice of parameters , significantly more than the corresponding correction due to heavy modes , fig .",
    "( [ fig : massmodecontrb ] ) .",
    "[ fig : theboundaryeffect ] ]    ]    finally , let us take note of the fluctuations like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctleadingtocap ] .",
    "these are the massive fluctuations of the string in the extra dimension about the classical solution @xmath170 .",
    "these fluctuations differ from the fluctuations that we have considered in sec .",
    "[ [ sec:1/d correction ] ] only near the boundary .",
    "it is worth noting that these fluctuations are most conveniently described using a normal gauge ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) rather than in the @xmath171 gauge that we have used , for when @xmath32 is close to the boundary even a small fluctuation @xmath172 in the @xmath61 coordinate can become a multiple - valued function of @xmath32 . in the holographic description of qcd flux tube",
    "these fluctuations are suggestive of the _ longitudinal _ fluctuations causing the flux tube to extend beyond the quark and the anti quark . in a future work",
    "we hope to probe their effects in confining geometries .",
    "the key features of the heavy - quark potential as suggested by the gauge / gravity duality in the large-@xmath0 limit can be summarized as @xmath173=\\left(1+h(l)\\right)\\frac{l}{l_{s}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\left(1-\\frac{2\\pi}{12}\\frac{l_{s}^{2}}{l^{2}}\\right)}+\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}m+v_{h}[l]\\right),\\label{eq : sumcorrection}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 is given by ( [ eq : defh ] ) and arises from the behavior of the massless modes in the vicinity of the quark and the antiquark .",
    "the contribution from the heavy modes is contained in @xmath175 $ ] , which is given by ( [ eq : defvh ] ) and its relative effect on the heavy - quark potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massmodecontrb ] . the leading contribution to the heavy - quark potential in the large-@xmath0 expansion",
    "is contained in the first term , while the last parentheses contains the @xmath13 corrections arising from the oscillations of the fundamental string in the fifth dimension . as we have noted in the introduction",
    ", there are possible @xmath13 and higher corrections arising from the massless modes in noncritical dimensions , which we have ignored in our analysis . to understand the manner in which they vanish for the critical dimension is an important and interesting problem to which we hope to come to in the future .",
    "there are two key qualitative features of @xmath176 $ ] .",
    "firstly , there is @xmath5the correction to the arvis potential by the factor @xmath174 .",
    "even though in our investigation we can not fix the precise form of @xmath174 , we can clearly see the reason for its existence .",
    "it arises from the simultaneous requirement that the fundamental string wants to lie at a fixed value @xmath34 , to minimize its energy , and the requirement that the fundamental string has to terminate on the boundary , @xmath26 , where the quark and the antiquark are placed .",
    "thus , the origin of @xmath174 is in the behavior of the flux tube in the vicinity of the quark and the antiquark .",
    "though the present numerical results are consistent with @xmath177 but our analysis strongly suggests that there should be corrections to the arvis potential , especially around @xmath178 and they should become visible in future calculations of the heavy - quark potential on the lattice . the other interesting feature of ( [ eq : sumcorrection ] ) is the existence of the constant term in the potential , @xmath179 . at first sight",
    "the existence of the constant term in the potential is of no consequence , but  as has been emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite  once the renormalization prescription for the expectation value of the wilson loop is appropriately fixed , the constant arises only from the corrections to the nambu - goto string .",
    "it is worth recalling that there is no constant term in the ground - state energy of a nambu - goto string as given by the arvis formula .",
    "the main motivation behind calculating the heavy - quark potential using gauge / gravity duality is to compare its predication with that of lattice qcd at all scales ; that is , from the scale where the potential is coulombic and the coupling constant is weak , to the strong - coupling scale where the qcd flux tubes are formed .",
    "the hope is that in this manner we can delineate the geometry of the five - dimensional curved space that incorporates both asymptotic freedom and confinement .",
    "having found such a geometry one can hope to calculate more interesting quantities , like the hadron masses and their parton distributions .",
