    "bright ( @xmath19 mjy at 850 @xmath14 m ) submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) were found to be mostly at high redshifts of @xmath203 , and they dominate the total star formation in this redshift range @xcite .",

    "the majority ( 8 out of 12 ; 67% ) of their sources were resolved by merlin+vla , again suggesting extended starbursts .",
    "however , the resolution of merlin+vla is insufficient to probe radio emission from compact radio agns .",
    "whether the remaining 33% of compact radio sources in the merlin+vla sample are powered by compact nuclear starbursts or by agns thus remains to be tested .",

    "eight adjacent 8  mhz baseband channel pairs were used in the observations , both with right- and left - hand circular polarizations , and sampled at two bits .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , nm , with a 2  s correlator integration time .",

    "the self - calibration solutions of the phase calibrator , j1229 + 6335 , were applied on the target source , goods 8503 , which was then deconvolved and imaged at various spatial resolutions by tapering the visibility data .",
    "imaging the target source at the full resolution of the vlbi array , which is @xmath11  mas ( @xmath12  pc , pa=@xmath42 ) , achieved an rms noise level of @xmath43jy  beam@xmath5 , but it did not reveal any continuum component in the field of goods  8503 .",

    "our coherence tests during these observations using two vlbi calibrators show that the lack of a strong point source in goods  8503 at the full resolution of the array can not be due to the phase referencing procedure .",

    "to do so , we applied two dimensional gaussian tapers on the visibility data with various values .",
    "however , the only image with a reliable @xmath48 , detection was obtained by applying a gaussian taper falling to 30% at 0.5 m@xmath49 in both the u- and v- directions .",

    ", a radio - loud agn dominates the emission at 1.4  ghz on a few mas size scale , with intrinsic brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath62  k.    @xcite have derived an empirical upper limit to the brightness temperature for nuclear starbursts . for a frequency value of 4  ghz ( our rest frequency ) , the resulting limit on the intrinsic brightness temperature",
    "is @xmath63  k , while typical radio - loud agns have brightness temperatures exceeding this value by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "these authors also present a possible physical model for this limit involving a mixed non - thermal and thermal radio emitting ( and absorbing ) plasma , constrained by the radio - to - fir correlation for star - forming galaxies .",
    "the measured intrinsic brightness temperature limit for the radio source in goods  8503 is consistent with the empirical upper limit value for nuclear starbursts .    for goods  8503 ,",
    "the derived intrinsic brightness temperatures from our vlbi observations are typical of starburst galaxies . however ,",
    "when compared to local starburst powered ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , such as arp  220 , mrk  273 , and iras  172080014 @xcite , the radio continuum emission from goods  8503 is an order of magnitude greater in luminosity , but also an order of magnitude larger in extent .    in starburst dominated galaxies ,",
    "the radio continuum is the sum of supernovae ( sne ) , supernova remnants , and residual relativistic electrons in the interstellar medium , as shown in the model presented by @xcite .",
    "however , detecting individual sne in goods  8503 at @xmath64 is unlikely .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of 49 luminous radio sne in the prototype ulirg arp  220 with flux densities between 0.053 and 1.228 mjy and typical upper limits on their linear extent of less then 1  pc . at the distance of goods  8503",
    ", the flux densities of such luminous radio sne would be between @xmath65jy .",
    "these values are two to three orders of magnitude lower that the rms noise levels achieved in our vlbi observations .",
    "our radio continuum results with the hsa clearly rule out a compact radio - loud agn in goods  8503 and show physical characteristics consistent with an extreme starburst .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out that the radio emission in this source is from a kpc scale radio - jet structure with a very faint compact agn component that contributes to less than 10% of the total radio continuum emission , and hence falls below our detection threshold at the full resolution of the array .",
    "therefore , we further extend the discussion regarding the nature of the power source(s ) in this smg , and whether it hosts a radio - quiet agn , by looking into the optical and ir properties of goods  8503 at various bands , as described in the following section .",
    "evidence for an intensive starburst in goods  8503 is also seen at various other wavelengths .",
    "first , @xcite presented a method of using the local radio  fir correlation and the radio and submillimeter flux densities to estimate redshifts of smgs .",
    "@xcite derived a simple redshift formula for arp 220-like spectral energy distribution ( seds ) : @xmath66 . with this formula , the measured redshift @xmath67 , and the radio and submillimeter fluxes of goods 8503",
    ", we find its radio and submillimeter sed to be consistent with arp 220 within 20% .",
    "this implies that this smg excellently follows the same radio  fir correlation as arp 220 , and suggests that its fir emission is powered by a starburst .",
    "goods  8503 is among the first smgs with an x - ray detection @xcite .",
    "it is detected at soft x - rays in the 2ms _ chandra _ image of the chandra deep field - north ( cdfn ) , but it is not detected at hard x - rays .",
    "it has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath68 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "these authors suggested that this source is powered by star formation , but they did not rule out a highly obscured agn with low x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite obtained a mir spectrum on goods 8503 ( gn06 in their paper ) and decomposed the spectrum into pah and `` continuum '' components .",
    "the continuum component contributes @xmath69 to its mir luminosity , and such a component can be powered by a dusty agn .",
    "the mir spectral decomposition method was further refined by @xcite , who noted that such mir continuum fraction is a strict upper limit on the agn contribution at this wavelength band .",
    "however , agn dust components are warmer than those powered by starbursts and contribute mainly to the mir .",
    "we therefore expect the agn fraction in the total ir luminosity of goods 8503 to be negligible .",
    "none of the above observational evidence , including our hsa observations , absolutely rule out the existence of an obscured agn in goods 8503 . however , a kpc - scale starburst is consistent with all observations from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "the last piece of evidence comes from the optical and nir morphologies . for the optical ,",
    "we combined the latest version of the four ( f435w , f606w , f775w , and f850lp ) _ hst _ acs images from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) to form a deep `` white '' optical image for goods 8503 . for the nir , we used three sets of data .",
    "first , lihwai lin et al .  ( in preparation ) obtained nearly 30 hr of goods - n imaging data at @xmath70-band with the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ) on the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "we downloaded these @xmath70-band data from the public archive and reduced them .",
    "we also used the wircam on cfht to obtain a deep @xmath71-band image with nearly 50 hr of integration .",
    "lastly , we obtained a deep @xmath71-band image of the goods - n with the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) on the 8.2  m subaru telescope .",
    "this moircs imaging is described in @xcite . in this imaging ,",
    "goods 8503 received approximately 4 hr of integration .",
    "all the above @xmath70- and @xmath71-band images are still being deepened by various groups .",
    "all the data reduction was carried out by our group using simple imaging and mosaicking pipeline ( simple , @xcite ) .",
    "more details about the @xmath71-band observations and data reduction can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath70-band data is identical to that of the @xmath71-band .",
    "here we adopt the moircs @xmath71-band image for morphological analyses because of its high angular resolution ( fwhm @xmath72 ) , and the wircam @xmath71-band image for photometry because of its greater depth .",
    "we present the ultradeep acs white , wircam @xmath70 , and moircs @xmath71 images of goods  8503 in figure  3 , and the f435w to 8.0 @xmath14 m photometry in table  2 .",
    "the acs fluxes were measured with @xmath73 apertures at the location of the @xmath71 source .",
    "this is the maximum possible aperture size for the acs fluxes to be free of contamination from nearby objects .",
    "the @xmath70-band image does not have sufficient resolution to separate goods  8503 from nearby objects , and therefore we did not attempt to measure its @xmath70-band flux .",
    "the @xmath71-band flux is measured with sextractor @xcite `` auto '' aperture , which approximates its total flux .",
    "in addition , @xcite used a clean - like method to construct _ spitzer _",
    "irac source catalogs based on the wircam @xmath71 image .",
    "we include their irac fluxes for goods  8503 in table  2 .",
    "we present the observed optical to irac sed in figure  4 .",
    "goods 8503 is extremely faint in the optical , undetected by even the combination of the four acs images ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "it shows some hint of flux at f850lp ( see table  2 ) but nothing appears visually in the f850lp image and the white image .",
    "it clearly shows up at @xmath70-band , however it is blended with a nearby galaxy . in the @xmath71-band and _ spitzer _",
    "images , goods 8503 is the brightest galaxy in its neighborhood . with the excellent , @xmath74 , resolution of subaru at @xmath71-band , the stellar component of goods  8503 is resolved .",
    "a simple gaussian fit to the source in this @xmath71-band image gives a fwhm of @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 kpc@xmath77 at its redshift .",
    "the image shows an elongated morphology , which may be indicative of an edge on rotating disk , and a pronounced central region that coincides with the radio position , but does not dominate the total @xmath71 luminosity .",
    "these are consistent with a nuclear starburst hosted by a massive galaxy .",
    "the above optical and near - ir observations imply a large galaxy of roughly 9  kpc in size that is entirely hidden by dust .",
    "this shows that dense molecular clouds are widely distributed in this galaxy , despite the fact that only its nucleus is actively forming stars .",
    "the results obtained from various bands in the electromagnetic spectrum ( radio to the x - ray ) suggest that the dominant power source in the smg goods  8503 is a startburst . therefore ,",
    "in the following , we derive an estimate of its star formation rate and star formation surface density .",
    "the 850  @xmath14 m flux density of goods  8503 implies a total ir luminosity of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 mjy@xmath5 ; @xcite ) . assuming that this ir luminosity is entirely powered by a starburst , then the associated star formation rate ( sfr ) is @xmath80 yr@xmath5 for a salpeter initial mass function ( @xmath81 yr@xmath82 ; @xcite ) .",
    "an estimate of the sfr can also be calculated using the conversion factor between radio luminosity and sfr ( @xmath81 yr@xmath83 ; @xcite ) , which is derived using the local radio  fir correlation .",
    "the radio luminosity of goods  8503 is @xmath84  w  hz@xmath5 , and the resulting sfr is @xmath85 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the consistency in the sfr values derived from the radio and the ir luminosities simply confirms that this smg follows the local radio - fir correlation .",
    "moreover , this suggests that the star formation activity is well confined within the radio source detected in our hsa observations .",
    "the size of the source seen in our 1.4 ghz image ( figure  2 ) compares well with other smgs , but is considerably smaller than optically selected starbursting galaxies at high redshift ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "from the size and the sfr of this smg , we derive a star formation rate surface density of @xmath86  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath87 .",
    "this surface density is extremely high even after including the @xmath88 uncertainty in its size .",
    "for instance , the derived @xmath89 in goods  8503 is a few times larger than that seen in a sample of smgs imaged at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "such a high value is at the very high end of smgs ( see figure  3 of @xcite ) , and is comparable to that measured in the two extremely luminous smgs resolved by high resolution submillimeter observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath89 in goods  8503 is comparable to that measured in the host galaxy of the @xmath90 qso sdss  j114816.64 + 525150.3 @xcite .",
    "such high @xmath89 values are consistent with recent theoretical descriptions of ( dust opacity ) eddington limited star formation of a radiation pressure - supperted starbursts on kpc scales @xcite .    using the population synthesis model of @xcite , the hyperz package @xcite package , and the acs , @xmath71 , and irac photometry in table  2",
    ", we find a stellar mass of @xmath91 @xmath26 in goods  8503 .",
    "the best - fit sed is shown in figure  4 . with a star formation rate of @xmath92 @xmath26 yr@xmath5 ,",
    "the stellar mass can be doubled in just 56 myr , roughly 1.6% of its hubble time .",
    "the model also requires an extinction of @xmath93 to explain the nondetections in the optical bands .",
    "we expect the extinction in the nuclear starburst component to be even larger .",
    "furthermore , we derive a value of 18  gyr@xmath5 for the star - formation rate per unit stellar mass ( i.e. , specific star - formation rate ; ssfr ) in goods  8503 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude higher than that seen in normal star forming galaxies at @xmath94 , which have ssfr values of about @xmath95  gyr@xmath5 @xcite .    in summary , goods",
    "8503 has a kpc - scale nuclear starburst with a star formation rate of @xmath92 @xmath26 yr@xmath5 .",
    "no evidence of an agn is seen at any wavelength .",
    "an upper limit on its mir agn contribution of 50% is estimated by @xcite , but the agn contribution to its total ir luminosity should be much lower . moreover , our hsa observations reveal that more than 90% of the radio continuum emission in this source is extended and not confined to a central compact agn .",
    "goods  8503 has a stellar component of @xmath91 @xmath26 with a spatial extent of roughly 9 kpc .",
    "this huge and massive stellar component is entirely hidden by dust , suggesting an extremely rich molecular gas reservoir fueling the nuclear starburst .",

    "<S> we present sensitive phase - referenced vlbi results on the radio continuum emission from the @xmath0 luminous submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) goods  8503 . </S>",

    "<S> our sensitive tapered vlbi image of goods  8503 at 0.47@xmath1 @xmath2 0.34@xmath1 ( @xmath3  kpc ) resolution shows a marginally resolved continuum structure with a peak flux density of @xmath4jy  beam@xmath5 , and a total flux density of @xmath6jy , consistent with previous vla and merlin measurements . </S>",

    "<S> kpc@xmath9 , and the derived intrinsic brightness temperature is @xmath10  k. the radio continuum position of this galaxy coincides with a bright and extended near - infrared source that nearly disappears in the deep hst optical image , indicating a dusty source of nearly 9  kpc in diameter . </S>",
    "<S> no continuum emission is detected at the full vlbi resolution ( @xmath11  mas , @xmath12  pc ) , with a @xmath13 point source upper limit of 26  @xmath14jy  beam@xmath5 , or an upper limit to the intrinsic brightness temperature of @xmath15   k. the extent of the observed continuum source at 1.4  ghz and the derived brightness temperature limits are consistent with the radio emission ( and thus presumably the far - infrared emission ) being powered by a major starburst in goods  8503 , with a star formation rate of @xmath162500  @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the absence of any continuum emission at the full resolution of the vlbi observations indicates the lack of a compact radio agn source in this @xmath0 smg . </S>"
