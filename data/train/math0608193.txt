    "matrix integrals provide models for physical systems ( 2d quantum gravitation , gauge theory , renormalization , etc ... ) , and generating series for a wide family of combinatorial objects ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "gaussian integrals are the most studied .",
    "it was shown by brzin , itzykson , parisi and zuber @xcite that perturbations of gaussian integrals expand formally as a generating function of maps , sorted by their genus when the dimension @xmath0 of the matrices is regarded as a parameter .",
    "such ` topological ' expansions were shown also to hold in the large @xmath0 limit , and then to match with the formal expansion on a mathematical level of rigor by two authors @xcite and previously in the one matrix case in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relation of gaussian matrices with the enumeration of maps is an easy consequence of wick calculus -or equivalently feynman diagrams- see @xcite for a good introduction .",
    "according to t hooft @xcite , such topological expansion should hold in the more general context of models invariant under unitary conjugation .",
    "this leads us to concentrate in this article on matrix integrals given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 are @xmath3 deterministic uniformly bounded matrices , @xmath4 denotes the haar measure on the unitary group @xmath5 ( normalized so that @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is a polynomial function in the non - commutative variables @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the usual trace on @xmath3 matrices given by @xmath10 .",
    "we will study in this article the first order asymptotics of matrix integrals given by when the joint distribution of the @xmath2 converges ; namely for all polynomial function @xmath11 in @xmath12 non - commutative indeterminates @xmath13 for some linear functional @xmath14 on the set of polynomials . without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume that @xmath2 are hermitian matrices .    for technical reasons ,",
    "it is convenient to assume that the polynomial @xmath7 is such that @xmath15 is real for all @xmath16 , all hermitian matrices @xmath17 , for all @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    under those very general assumptions , the only result proved",
    "so far is the formal convergence of these matrix integrals .",
    "namely , it was proved in @xcite by one author that for each @xmath20 , the quantity @xmath21 converges towards a constant @xmath22 depending only on the limiting distribution of the @xmath17 s and @xmath7 . besides , if @xmath7 is polynomial with integer coefficients , @xmath22 is a polynomial function with integer coefficients of the limit moments of the @xmath17 s .    in this paper",
    "we will answer affirmatively to the following , previously open questions :    1 .",
    "does the limit of the matrix integrals exist for small parameters @xmath23 ?",
    "does the power series @xmath24 have a strictly positive radius of convergence ? 3 .",
    "is the limit of the matrix integral equal to the power series ?    the following theorem is a precise decription of our results :    [ main ] under the above hypotheses and if we further assume that the spectral radius of the matrices @xmath25 is uniformly bounded ( by say @xmath26 ) , there exists @xmath27 so that for @xmath28 $ ] , the limit @xmath29 exists .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 is an analytic function of @xmath31 and for all @xmath32 , @xmath33    this also implies that the series @xmath30 has a positive radius of convergence , a result which had not been proved by the techniques of @xcite based on weingarten functions .",
    "our approach is based on non - commutative differential calculus ( in particular on the resulting schwinger - dyson or master loop equations ) and perturbation analysis as developed in the context of gaussian matrices in @xcite .",
    "another possibility to prove the equality between real and formal limits would have been to show convergence of the integrals for complex parameters @xmath23 .",
    "we have not yet been able to follow this line successfully , and this remains an open question .",
    "an important example of unitary matrix integral is the so - called spherical integral , studied by harish - chandra and by itzykson and zuber , @xmath34 this integral is of fundamental importance in analytic lie theory and was computed for the first time by harish - chandra in @xcite . in the last two decades it has also become an issue to study its large dimension asymptotics @xcite .",
    "theorem [ main ] holds true for the hciz integral .",
    "it thus relates the results of @xcite ( which computed the formal limit of the hciz integral ) and those of @xcite ( where the limit of @xmath35 was obtained ( regardless of any small parameters assumptions ) by using large deviations techniques ) .",
    "let us recall the limit found in @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath36 if @xmath37 ( resp .",
    "@xmath38 ) denote the limiting spectral measure of @xmath39 ( resp .",
    "@xmath40 ) , assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are finite . then , the limit of @xmath43 is given , according to @xcite , by @xmath44 where the infimum is taken over @xmath45 so that the measure - valued process @xmath46 is a continuous process , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the inf over @xmath50 is taken ( see @xcite ) at the solution of an euler equation for isentropic flow with negative pressure @xmath51 .",
    "theorem [ main ] shows that @xmath52 depends analytically on @xmath53 in a real neightbourhood of @xmath54 , a result which is not obvious from formula .",
    "moreover , the coefficients of this expansion count certain planar graphs ( see section [ seccombinatorics ] ) , as summarized in the following theorem .",
    "denote @xmath55 the probability measure @xmath56 assume that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two compactly supported probability measures .",
    "then , there exists @xmath57 such that for all @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 converges absolutely .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath60 @xmath61 is the set of planar maps drawn above @xmath62 vertices defined as stars of type @xmath63 by gluing pairwise oriented arrows and possibly rings and @xmath64 is the weight of the map .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ seccombinatorics ] for the definitions of stars , admissible maps and weights .",
    "our definition of planar maps is more complicated than those arising in the topological expansion of gaussian matrix models ( and which are directly related with wick gaussian calculus and feynman diagrams ) : the sums are signed and we have a notion of admissibility .",
    "however it was an open question in mathematical physics to have a graphical model for unitary integrals ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this graphical interpretation gives a new understanding of cumulants formulae ( see section [ applicfreep ] ) .",
    "the convergence of other integrals was still unknown and it is one of the points of this paper to show their convergence .",
    "we use it to study voiculescu s microstates entropy evaluated at a set of laws which are small perturbations of the law of free variables , and prove regularity of microstates    for tracial states @xmath65 satisfying suitable assumptions described in theorem [ thmfreeentropy ] , @xmath66 and a formula for @xmath67 can be given .",
    "this result generalizes section 4 in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after setting our working framework ( section [ notations ] ) , we study the action of perturbations upon the integral @xmath68 and deduce some properties of the related gibbs measure ; namely that the so - called empirical distribution of the matrices under this gibbs measure satisfies asymptotically an equation called the schwinger - dyson equation ( section [ matrixmodels ] ) .",
    "then , we study this equation and obtain uniqueness for parameters of the potential @xmath7 small enough ( section [ studysd ] ) and analyticity ( section [ formalanalyticity ] ) .",
    "we also describe a ( new ) combinatorial solution of schwinger - dyson equation ( section [ seccombinatorics ] ) and therefore of the first order of unitary matrix integrals .",
    "we deduce applications of these results to free probability ( section [ secfreeproba ] ) and to the convergence of matrix integrals @xmath68 ( section [ secmatrixintegrals ] ) . finally , we point out some consequence of our result for free entropy ( section [ secfreeentropy ] ) . at",
    "last , we consider the case where integration holds over the orthogonal group instead of the unitary group and show that the first order of such integrals is the same .",
    "let @xmath69 be the set of @xmath3 unitary matrices , @xmath70 the set of @xmath3 matrices with complex entries , @xmath71 the subset of hermitian matrices of @xmath70 and @xmath72 the subset of antihermitian matrices of @xmath70 .",

    "we first start with the definition of stars and root stars , in the spirit of @xcite .    1",

    "one of the element is marked .",

    "we associate ( bijectively ) an * element * as follows ; a diamond of color @xmath193 if @xmath416 and a ring of color @xmath193 if @xmath417 or @xmath418 ; in the case of @xmath81 ( resp .",
    "@xmath418 ) we attach before the ring an outgoing arrow of color @xmath193 ( resp .",

    "a * root star of type @xmath113 * is obtained by drawing on the oriented circle the elements associated to the successive letters of @xmath113 in the counter clockwise order , the arrows being drawn inside the circle .",
    "its first element is distinguished .",
    "although the maps are on the sphere , in the graphical representation of this section we will draw them on the plane and , to highlight the role of the root star we will draw it in this section such that it contains all the other stars .",
    "it can be viewed as the star centered in infinity or as the outer face of the dual map . besides , on a root star we will distinguish a root element .",
    "if @xmath113 contains no @xmath81 nor @xmath418 , there are no root element .",
    "if @xmath113 contains a @xmath81 , the ring associated to the last @xmath419 is the root element .",
    "if @xmath113 contains no @xmath81 but some @xmath418 , the ring associated to the first @xmath420 is called the root element .",
    "a * multistar * is a set of @xmath20 stars inside a root star drawn on the same plane with a coherent orientation .",
    "the figure [ vertex ] shows a concrete example of a multistar . in the middle of the picture",
    "there is a star of type @xmath63 and , surrounding it , a root star of type @xmath421 .",
    "we are now ready to introduce the main objects in our combinatorial model , namely , maps :    a * map * is a decoration of a multistar into a connected graph embedded in the plane by drawing two species of edges between rings :    1 .   a first category of edges , called  dotted edges \" , can be drawn between rings either attached to two outgoing arrows of the same color or to two incoming arrows of the same color .",
    "these edges can only have rings as end points , not diamonds or arrows .",
    "rings can have any number of dotted edges going out of them , possibly none .",
    "a second category of edges , called  colored oriented edge \" arises from the connection of an arrow going out of a star ( associated with a variable @xmath81 ) into an incoming arrow ( associated to a variable @xmath418 ) of the same color .",
    "these colored oriented edges is a pairing between the set of @xmath81 s and the set of @xmath418 s : exactly one incoming arrow is glued to each outgoing arrow .",
    "in addition , all the above edges do not cross , all arrows are paired but rings can be attached to any number of dotted edges ( including to none ) .    in the remainder of this section we keep considering pictures drawn on the sphere ( and in fact on the plane ) . they therefore give rise to graphs with vertices , edges and faces - together with additional decoration . for our forthcoming definitions ,",
    "we need to clarify the notion of ` face ' : we consider that faces of a graph are the connected components of the complementary of the graph on the sphere .",
    "however , we take the convention that the original stars are ` fattened vertices ' . therefore the interior of stars will not be considered as faces ( neither is the exterior of the root star ) .",
    "each ` face ' component of a map is isomorphic to a disc ; thus this is an actual face .",
    "this is due to the fact that our map is embedded into a sphere .",
    "this condition would not be granted in the case of an embedding into a higher genus oriented 2d compact manifold . in this case",
    "it would have to stand in the definition of a map of ` higher genus ' : this will be of use for future work but for the sake of simplicity we do not emphasize this notion in this paper .",
    "next , we define the weight of a map .",
    "the boundary of a face is homeomorphic to a circle , it is given an orientation ( the orientation of the sphere ) and is decorated with diamonds ( note that all arrows have been paired ) ; it thus has the structure of a star except for the distinguished element .",
    "assume we are given the tracial state @xmath14 of .",
    "* first we define the weight of the faces of a map .",
    "the boundary of a face have the structure of a star , i.e. it has the topology of a circle with some diamonds on it .",
    "we can therefore associated each of these boundaries with a monomial in the @xmath80 s , given up to cyclic permutation ( or equivalently up to knowing its first letter ) .",
    "the weight of a face is the trace @xmath422 ( which does not depend on cyclic permutations ) of the monomial @xmath113 associated with its boundary . *",
    "the weight of the map @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath423 , is the product of the weights of its faces times a sign given by @xmath424 to the power the number of dotted edges .    as we said before",
    ", not all maps will contribute and we need to define now the notion of admissible maps .",
    "admissibility can be checked by an inductive procedure * ip * , which ressembles tutte s surgery @xcite and which amounts to check one after the other whether edges of the map are admissible . once an edge has been checked , it is frozen and we continue by checking the other edges .    *",
    "inductive procedure * ip * * :    a- if the root star has no root element , then it can not be connected to any other star and hence the graph can not be a map unless there is no other star in which case the map is just the trivial graph with no edges .",
    "b- the root star has a root element which is associated to a @xmath81 ( resp . a @xmath418 ) , for some @xmath18 .",
    "1-then , we first check the admissibility of the dotted edges starting from this root element .",
    "we first consider the dotted edge which is the farthest from the arrow and declare it admissible if its other vertex is a ring of an outgoing ( resp .",
    "ingoing ) arrow and that _ there is no other dotted edge _ attached to this ring which is farther ( amongst the unfrozen dotted edges ) from its arrow .",
    "once this condition is verified , we freeze this dotted edge and the root element remains the root element .",
    "we check all dotted edges of the root element inductively .",
    "once a dotted edge has been checked to be admissible , it is frozen and we go on checking the others .",
    "once all the dotted edges of the root element have been checked , they are frozen and may separate the graph into subgraphs .",
    "thus , the map may have been cut into disjoint subgraphs whose boundary ( which may contain dotted edges ) is homeomorphic to a disc ( in the case where it has edges glued with an internal star , we see these other stars as part of the external star by following all the graph connected to the external boundary ) . in each of these subgraphs",
    ", we declare the first ( following the orientation of the plane ) element ( corresponding to a @xmath81 or a @xmath418 ) after the last frozen dotted edge of its boundary as distinguished .",
    "we then define the root element of the boundaries of these subgraphs by the same procedure as for the root star .",
    "the boundary of each subgraph is then a star and these subgraphs have now the structure of a map ; we will call them submaps .    for instance , in figure [ map1 ] , once the two dotted edges have been checked and frozen , the map is cut into two disjoint submaps , the left one having a fixed frozen dotted edge between the root element and the inner star ( thus forbidding other edges to cross it and allowing us to consider the inner star as part of the external star ) .",
    "the boundary of this left subgraph is now seen as a star of type @xmath425 .",
    "this left subgraph has the same distinguished element as before but a new root element ( here the outgoing arrow on its boundary corresponding to the first @xmath378 in @xmath113 ) .",
    "2- when all dotted edges are frozen , we check that the arrow of the root element is paired with an arrow of the opposite direction ( note that if the root element comes from a @xmath418 , it can only be paired with an element of another star since by definition there is no more outgoing arrows on the root star ) .",
    "the oriented edge is seen as a fat edge . in particular ,",
    "if the oriented edge link the root star with another star , we see this other star as part of the root star for the next step , i.e we identify the root star of type @xmath426 glued to the star of type @xmath427 ( by the marked @xmath81 s ) with the root star of type @xmath428 with , by convention , the distinguished element chosen to be the closest element after the glued @xmath418 . if the oriented edge link two rings of the root star , two disjoint subgraphs are formed and we proceed as in -1- .",
    "c- we continue the inductive procedure on the submaps until all edges have been checked to be admissible .",
    "now we can define weighted sum of admissible maps .",
    "assume we are given the tracial state @xmath14 of .",
    "we define the weighted sum of admissible maps constructed above the stars @xmath429 and the root star @xmath11 : @xmath430 where the sum runs over all admissible maps @xmath12 constructed above @xmath429 with root star @xmath431 . assuming that @xmath432 where @xmath280 are monomials",
    ", we define the formal series : @xmath433 with @xmath434 where the monomial @xmath435 appears in @xmath436 successive position and @xmath437 , @xmath438 .",
    "remark that we do not count all the maps which contain the stars @xmath439,  ,@xmath440 but only those that are constructed using our inductive rules ; they for instance forbid to glue the two same rings more than twice .",
    "however , a given map is counted at most once since there is only one way to decompose it using the procedure * ip*. indeed , it is easy to check that at each step we have only one possibility for the next step since the dotted edges have to be drawn one after the other following the orientation and no new dotted edge can be drawn after the arrow of the root has been glued .    * example *    let us show some examples .",
    "we start from one root star and a star on the sphere ( see figure [ vertex ] ) .",
    "we want to construct maps above these stars with our rules , starting with the root element shown by the arrow outside the root star .",
    "figures [ map1 ] , [ map2 ] and [ map4 ] are examples of such maps .",
    "note that the weights of the maps of figures [ map1 ] and [ map2 ] are the same , the only difference is the way the three rings are glued .",
    "there is a third way to glue those three rings shown in figure [ map3 ] which is a map but can not be obtained by our rule of construction ( and thus is not admissible ) .",

    "we apply schwinger - dyson equation to this quantity :    @xmath461    now , we can apply our induction hypothesis since all polynomials appearing in the right hand side have degree strictly smaller than @xmath453 .",
    "we need to show that this is exactly the induction relation for maps . to construct a map above a star of type @xmath459 , we first look at the root element @xmath81 and we have to decide what to do first with the dotted edges . there are two possibilities :    1 .",
    "the first possibility is that there is no dotted edge going outside of the ring of the root .",
    "in such a case , we can glue the arrow to any other arrow of opposite direction and of the same color ( corresponding to a variable @xmath418 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath460 decomposes into @xmath462 and we construct an oriented edge between @xmath81 and @xmath418 .",
    "thus we separate the map into two parts and we have to construct a map above the @xmath373 part and another one above the @xmath370 part ( this is the case 2 of * ip * ) .",
    "this gives @xmath463 possibilities which is exactly the possibilities counted by the second term in the right hand side of .",
    "the second possibility is that we glue the root ring to another ring with a dotted edge .",
    "thus @xmath460 must decompose into @xmath464 and the creation of the dotted edge amounts to decompose the map into @xmath465 and @xmath466 and again to continue the construction of the map we will have to construct a map above the @xmath465 part and another one above the @xmath466 part ( note here that when a dotted edge is attached to a circle of an @xmath81 , the arrow and the circle keep their structure and live on the right of the dotted edge ) . in this procedure , we have fixed one dotted edge and thus multiplied the contribution of the resulting map by @xmath424 ( this is the case 1 of * ip * ) . the resulting contribution to @xmath467",

    "note here that no dotted edges between rings of incoming arrows can be drawn since if there are no outgoing arrows in a map , but some @xmath418 , there is no contribution . by traciality of @xmath65",
    ", we deduce as well that @xmath471 is tracial . indeed ,",

    "thus we need to show that the two other terms take into account the case where @xmath81 is linked to another star of type @xmath435 . according to our construction rules we have two possibilities :    1 .   starting from @xmath81 we glue the arrow to an arrow of the same color entering a star of type @xmath113 .",
    "this rule forbids any other gluing from @xmath81 , this is counted by @xmath484 the coefficient @xmath436 counts the number of choices for the star of type @xmath435 since they are all labelled .",
    "2 .   the other possibility is to glue the ring to a ring of the same color .",
    "this leads to @xmath485 possibilities .    in the case where @xmath11 does not contain any @xmath81 , @xmath486 but still some @xmath418 ,",
    "the root of the root star can only be glued by a dotted edge to any other @xmath418 , or by a directed edge to a @xmath81 of a star .",

    "when one of the ring glued to this node becomes the root in the recursive construction , it has to be glued to one of the other ring glued to the node .",

    "we have as many choices as they are trees with @xmath519 edges ( to glue the @xmath514 ring we need exactly @xmath519 edges ) .",

    "note that we have defined this map above a star which is not of type @xmath113 for any monomial @xmath113 .",
    "this would be a problem for admissible maps since * ip * requires the presence of oriented edges .",

    "actually , proposition [ propappfreeproba ] gives us a new proof of the following corollary , due to speicher and known as non - crossing moebius formula    the following inversion formula holds true : @xmath540 where @xmath541 is the kreweras complement ( see @xcite ) and @xmath542 the catalan number .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the previous proposition .",
    "remember that @xmath543 is a weighted sum over maps with dotted edges since the star contains some rings and no arrows .",

    "the weight associated to this map is a product whose factors are : @xmath515 for each node of degree @xmath514 and the weight of each face .",
    "the faces are by definition the component of the kreweras complement of @xmath545 .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath546 the formula follows after taking @xmath547 .    as a further remark",
    ", one can also read graphically the main properties of cumulants , for example , @xmath548 as soon as there are occurence of free elements .",
    "more precisely , assume that we can partition the @xmath163 s into two families the @xmath456 s and the @xmath346 s with the algebra generated by the @xmath456 s free from the algebra generated by the @xmath346 s .",
    "then if all the @xmath163 s do not take value in the same algebra , @xmath548 .",
    "indeed , one can replace all the family of @xmath456 s by the one of @xmath549 with @xmath7 unitary and free from the other variables .",
    "now when looking at the combinatorial interpretation of @xmath550 we can see that the oriented edges coming from @xmath7 separate the components containing the @xmath456 s from the others . by following those edges we see that the faces they are defining contain only variable from one of the two algebras ( the edges are going in the clockwise order around the faces which contain the @xmath346 s and in the counter - clocwise order around the faces containing the @xmath456 s ) .",
    "thus , in the decomposition , the terms corresponding to partitions with one component containing both some @xmath80 s and some @xmath551 s vanish . by uniqueness of the decomposition into cumulants",
    "we deduce that those elements vanish i.e. @xmath548 .",
    "these remarks are not new but this shows that our graphical model fully encompasses the theory of non - crossing cumulants and that the schwinger - dyson equation can also be read in terms of cumulants .",
    "it is interesting to mention here that papers @xcite and @xcite have developed a calculus on annuli which seems to be related to our graphical model .",
    "however these approaches only deal with the asymptotics of second order cumulants whereas our approach via formal calculus , see section [ formalanalyticity ] , allows us to deal with arbitrary order cumulants .",
    "the actual relation can be found in @xcite , where convolution on partitioned permutations is introduced and showed to be the relevant algebraic tool to handle higher order freeness , namely , the asymptotic behaviour of cumulants of unitarily invariant random matrices .",
    "but the results in our paper give an explicit algorithmic description of the moebius inversion formula and therefore of higher order cumulants .",
    "as in the one star case , cumulants are also obtained by inserting an outer @xmath552 between each variable of each star and by looking at generating function where @xmath378 is linked to its neighboring @xmath553 .",
    "it is interesting to see that a direct ( yet difficult to describe ) graphical reading of the schwinger - dyson equation , which is our main tool of investigation of unitarily invariant matrix models , yields non - crossing and could yield higher order moments related series and operations similar to convolution , although these latter results rely on more representation theoretic grounds ( weingarten function theory as developed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is not obvious to us how the schwinger - dyson equation can be read off from the results of @xcite ( without writing a change of variable invariance formula ) , and it would be interesting to attempt to figure out the meaning of schwinger - dyson equation at the representation theoretic level .",

    "we obtain a map with two faces .",

    "the sign of a map is easy to compute , it is @xmath424 to the power the number of dotted lines in the map .",
    "equivalently since in the case of hciz integral the number of oriented edges is equal to the number of stars , this number is also equal to the number of faces of the map and thus to the number of factor in the product of moments of the weight . in figure [ iz4 ] , we have drawn all unlabelled planar maps one can construct with @xmath587 stars . to compute the exact coefficient of each map one has to multiply it by the number of way to distribute the labels and divide by @xmath588 .",

    "for @xmath0 large enough , @xmath185 is a diffeomorphism ; it is as in the complex case a local diffeomorphism which is injective . as such",
    ", its image is open and compact .",
    "@xmath691 is not connected but the union of copies of @xmath692 , @xmath693 or @xmath424 . since @xmath694 , @xmath185 maps @xmath695 into itself for each choice of @xmath696 .",
    "therefore , by connectedness of this set , @xmath697 is open and closed and therefore equals @xmath695 .",
    "thus , @xmath185 is a diffeomorphism of @xmath678 . like in the proof of lemma [ lempsi ]",
    ", we need to compute the jacobian of this change of variable .",
    "the same arguments apply to show that @xmath698 with @xmath699 the linear operator defined on antisymmetric matrices by @xmath700    a basis of @xmath690 is given , for @xmath701 , by @xmath702 therefore , the trace of any linear endomorphism @xmath703 on @xmath690 defined by @xmath704 , for uniformly bounded matrices @xmath705 , @xmath706 , is now given by @xmath707 since the operator norm of @xmath705 and @xmath706 is uniformly bounded , @xmath188 is uniformly bounded in @xmath0 .",
    "we can apply this bound to our case where @xmath705 and @xmath706 are given by @xmath708 .",
    "the @xmath705 and @xmath706 s are uniformly bounded since the @xmath709 s and the @xmath456 s are and non zero for a finite number of @xmath318 s , thus we deduce that @xmath710 with @xmath188 bounded uniformly in @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath188 is uniformly bounded , we can now proceed exactly as in the proof of theorem [ mainsec1 ] to show that for any @xmath711 , @xmath712 as a consequence , for any limit point @xmath14 of @xmath174 , any antisymmetric polynomial @xmath11 , @xmath713 if @xmath11 is symmetric , we claim that for any @xmath711 , @xmath714 so that still holds . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath460 is a word in the @xmath715 , @xmath716 since the trace is invariant under transposition , we deduce that for all @xmath11 , @xmath717 and thus , @xmath718    with the same method , we can deal with the cyclic derivative term .",
    "indeed , since @xmath719 , if we write @xmath720 , we obtain : @xmath721 to sum up , @xmath722 from which we get by going to the limit .",
    "since any polynomial @xmath11 can be decomposed as the sum of a symmetric polynomial ( @xmath723 ) and an antisymmetric polynomial ( @xmath724 ) , we conclude by linearity that holds for any polynomial @xmath11 . by uniqueness of the solutions to this equation for sufficiently small parameters @xmath142 proved in theorem [ mainsec2 ] , the proof is complete .",
