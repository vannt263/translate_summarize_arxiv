    "we have recently studied nuclear pairing in meson - exchange models of the nuclear interaction using a dirac - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( dhfb ) approximation to nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "an important conclusion of this study is that the short - range @xmath0s@xmath1 pairing correlations in nuclear matter are essentially identical to the short - range correlations of the two - nucleon virtual state , due to the dominance of the virtual state in the @xmath0s@xmath1 channel . in non - relativistic calculations , khodel , khodel and clark@xcite also noted a close similarity between the pairing gap function and the short - range vertex function of the virtual state@xcite , which prompted them to suggest that the virtual state be used as the starting point in calculating the gap function . in our relativistic calculations , however , the similarity of the dirac pairing fields and the vertex functions is so striking that we can claim that the two are essentially identical .",
    "we make use of this quasi - identity to develop a separable approximation to the relativistic pairing potential that correctly takes into account the high momentum contributions of the short - range two - nucleon correlations .",
    "another indication that a separable potential can describe nuclear pairing correlations comes from the usual assumption of a constant pairing gap in finite nucleus calculations .",
    "the analysis of the hfb equations in the zero - range limit of the two - nucleon interaction shows that the separable potential approximation becomes an _",
    "exact _ formulation of the pairing problem in the zero - range limit as the pairing potential then becomes independent of the baryon momentum .",
    "the pairing field also become independent of the baryon momentum and vary only with respect to the baryon density of the nuclear matter , which is equivalent to a constant pairing gap assumption .",
    "thus , the separable potential approximation for the pairing field can be seen as the simplest extension , to finite - range two - nucleon interactions and all baryon densities , of the zero - range limit of the hfb - equations .",
    "it gives the simplest improvement to the usual assumption of a constant pairing gap .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a rank - one , separable interaction that accurately describes the dhfb pairing field at all densities . in section",
    "ii , we clarify the close relationship between the pairing field and the two - nucleon @xmath0s@xmath1 virtual state vertex function and use this relationship to define the separable interaction . in section iii , we demonstrate the goodness of the separable interaction through comparisons with exact dhfb calculations of nuclear matter .",
    "the bound - state correlations in a two - particle system can be roughly classified as asymptotic ones and short - range ones .",
    "the asymptotic correlations are determined principally by the binding energy , while the short - range ones depend on the high - momentum components of the wave function .",
    "this can be seen by examining the manner in which a bound pair appears in the two - body t - matrix , @xmath2 .",
    "the t - matrix satisfies the integral equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the two - body interaction and @xmath5 the free two - body propagator .",
    "a bound state corresponds to a pole in the t - matrix at a negative value of the energy , @xmath6 . we can decompose the t - matrix , in this case , as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bound - state vertex function and @xmath9 is the continuum component of the t - matrix ( and , possibly , the contributions of other bound state poles ) . substituting the decomposition in the integral equation , eq .",
    "( [ lipsch ] ) , we verify that the vertex function satisfies the equation @xmath10 the vertex function of the two - nucleon bound state is closely related to its wave function , @xmath11 , which satisfies the differential equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the free two - nucleon system .    here",
    "we see the rough division of the two - nucleon correlations in the vacuum .",
    "the asymptotic correlations are determined by the singularity of the green s function @xmath14 while the short - range ones are contained in the high momentum components of the vertex function , @xmath15 .",
    "this analysis can also be extended to the nucleon pairing correlations in nuclear matter .",
    "one can directly associate the bound - state vertex function @xmath15 of the t - matrix with the pairing field of the hfb approximation , @xmath16 , and the adjoint vertex function , @xmath17 , with the time - reverse conjugate pairing field , @xmath18 . to demonstrate this",
    ", we develop the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 in a formal way , by comparing the equations that define the two .",

    "the matrix @xmath29 relates transposed quantities to the complex conjugates of time - reversed ones .",
    "it is given by @xmath30 , where the pauli matrix @xmath31 acts in the isospin space and @xmath32 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the anomalous propagator @xmath33 in the self - consistency equation , eq .",
    "( [ del1 ] ) , is one of the number - non - conserving components of the baryon propagator @xmath34 , which , in the gorkov formalism , takes the form @xmath35 in which @xmath36 is the usual number - conserving propagator and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the corresponding time - reversed propagators .",
    "the baryon propagator @xmath34 can be written in terms of the self - energy and pairing fields , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a lagrange multiplier used to fix the average baryon density .",
    "the form of the @xmath43s@xmath44 pairing field can be determined from the hermiticity and antisymmetry properties of the lagrangian density , as well as the translational , rotational and isospin symmetries of symmetric nuclear matter , as is shown in ref . .",
    "the general form obtained for the field is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the baryon 4-momentum , @xmath47 and the isospin orientation @xmath48 is arbitrary .",
    "we note that @xmath49 corresponds to the standard case of proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing .",
    "we can decompose the self - consistency equation for the pairing field , eq .",

    "the components of the anomalous propagator , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 carry the information of the density - dependent nucleon self - energy and pairing mean - fields .",
    "the pairing potentials @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 also possess a density dependence associated with the retardation terms , which account for the finite meson propagation velocity . in eqs.([paireq ] ) , these retardation terms are neglected since their effects on the pairing fields have been found to be small@xcite .",
    "the density dependence remaining in the self - consistent pairing equations , eqs.([paireq ] ) , is thus entirely contained in the components of the anomalous propagator .",
    "when the baryon density @xmath67 tends to zero , both the self - energy @xmath39 and the pairing field @xmath40 also tend to zero .",
    "the anomalous propagator @xmath33 can then be well approximated by @xmath68 an approximation that becomes exact at zero density .",
    "the vacuum limit of the pairing field thus satisfies the homogeneous equation @xmath69    turning now to the bethe - salpeter equation , we write the bound - state vertex function as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the center - of - mass four momentum of the baryon pair and @xmath72 is their relative four momentum .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation for the vertex function , in the ladder approximation , is often written as @xmath73 where the free baryon propagator @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 we can rewrite this in a matrix form , making use of the matrix b , as @xmath76 comparing this expression with the self - consistency equation for the vacuum pairing field , eq .",

    "( [ inversa ] ) , and * associate the pairing field and the vertex function as @xmath78 where we now suppress the center - of - mass dependence of the vertex function .",
    "we thus conclude that the self - consistency equation for the vacuum pairing field is identical to the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "an analysis of the symmetry and antisymmetry properties that we expect of the center - of - mass bethe - salpeter vertex function , @xmath79 , leads us to the following form , @xmath80 which is identical to that of the pairing field @xmath81 given in eq .",

    "( [ paireq ] ) , and are given in the appendix .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the bound two - nucleon pair , that is , the bound two - nucleon mass , @xmath85 , is given by @xmath86 in the appendix , the equivalence between the vacuum pairing equation and the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation is once again demonstrated , by reducing the explicit form of the components of the pairing equation , eqs .",
    "( [ paireq ] ) , to the components of the bethe - salpeter equation , eqs .",
    "( [ gammaeq ] ) , in the vacuum limit .    the above expressions are valid for a bound two - body system in the vacuum .",
    "if the pole of the t - matrix corresponds to a virtual state ( anti - bound state ) , as in the case of the physical @xmath0s@xmath1 two - nucleon channel , one must redefine the integrands through an analytic continuation into the second sheet of the complex energy plane@xcite .",
    "the analytical continuation introduces an additional term , which takes into account the discontinuity of the propagator across the cut in the energy plane . in the components of the bethe - salpeter equation , eqs .",
    "( [ gammaeq ] ) , in which the negative - energy states have been neglected , the analytically continued equations can be obtained through the substitution , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mass of the two - nucleon virtual state , @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "the equations for the components of the vertex - function then become @xmath91 the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given by eqs.([gammaeq ] ) with the mass of the bound state @xmath85 substituted by that of the virtual state @xmath94 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we have found that the momentum dependence of the components of the pairing field @xmath95 , calculated with various sets of interaction parameters , shows a very small variation over a wide range of values of the baryon density and a wide range of cut - offs ( @xmath56 between 2.5 @xmath96 and 15.0 @xmath96)@xcite . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the momentum dependence of the principal components of the pairing field , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , for several values of the fermi momentum , which were obtained using the @xmath99 parameters of ref.@xcite with a momentum cutoff of @xmath100 10 @xmath96 .",
    "note that the curves denoted by fermi momentum zero correspond to the components of the vertex function of the @xmath0s@xmath1 virtual state in the vacuum .",
    "the small variation in the components as a function of the fermi momentum suggests the use of the momentum dependence at one value of the density .",
    "use of the vacuum momentum dependence is particularly convenient , since in this case a direct correspondence exists between the self - consistent pairing field and the bethe - salpeter vertex function .",
    "a direct comparison between the numerical solutions for the vertex function , @xmath101 , and for the pairing field , @xmath81 , gives us the following very good approximate relations between the components of the two fields , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a density - dependent factor determining the overall magnitude of the pairing fields .",
    "we emphasize that , in the nonrelativistic approach of khodel , khodel and clark , the virtual state vertex function serves only as a good starting point for calculating the pairing field@xcite , while in our relativistic approach , the two are essentially identical in form .",
    "we can explain the difference between the two approaches by analyzing the effective gap function for the positive energy dhfb states , which takes the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 and the effective momentum and mass of the quasi - nucleons , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , are defined in the appendix .",
    "the gap function @xmath108 is the quantity whose role is closest to that of the non - relativistic pairing field@xcite . like the non - relativistic self - energy ,",
    "the gap function is the difference between two larger relativistic quantities , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "( @xmath111 is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the other components . )",
    "the effective mass @xmath112 that appears in the gap function varies strongly with the nuclear matter density .",
    "although the form of the components of the dirac pairing field remain almost constant with density , the gap function changes , due to its dependence on @xmath112 .",
    "the density independence of the form of the relativistic pairing field thus does not carry over to the nonrelativistic field .",
    "the invariant momentum dependence of the components of the pairing fields suggests a separable form for an effective potential , in which each of the components of the interaction , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , is proportional to the corresponding component of the vertex function , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "such potentials are well known from the nonrelativistic treatment of the two - nucleon problem .",
    "it is such a separable form of the non - relativistic pairing potential that khodel , khodel and clark suggest as a starting point for calculating the nonrelativistic gap function@xcite . here",
    ", we use a form appropriate for the components of the relativistic pairing field that also preserves the symmetry in the two momenta , @xmath72 and @xmath116 , of the potential , taking @xmath117 where the potential strengths , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , are obtained through the simultaneous solution of eqs.([gammaeq ] ) and ( [ eq : s8 ] ) , in the case of a bound state , or eqs.([gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : s8 ] ) , in the case of a virtual state .",
    "we note that , although we have included the equation for the tensor component @xmath121 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s11 ] ) and ( [ eq : s8 ] ) , we have neglected this component in our numerical calculations .",
    "the inclusion of the tensor term offers little further calculational difficulty but , being extremely small , has little effect on the rest of the calculation .    for",
    "any given meson - exchange potential , we have shown in ref.@xcite that the size of the pairing gap , for low baryon densities , is correlated with the energy of the virtual state of the t - matrix , @xmath122 .",
    "the value of @xmath122 , in turn is related to the baryon momentum cut - off , @xmath56 , in the integrals of the self - consistency equations .",
    "consequently , fixing @xmath122 at its physical value in the bethe - salpeter equation for @xmath8 determines a ( usually unique ) value for @xmath56 .",
    "the separable potential introduces two additional parameters , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , when the tensor term is neglected .",
    "these parameters , together with the momentum cutoff , @xmath83 , are fixed by requiring that the energy of the two nucleon state and the ratio of the vertex functions be equal to the respective ones obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation with a meson - exchange potential .",
    "together , the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath83 introduce an ambiguity in the determination of the separable potential .",
    "our calculations have shown that , within a wide range of values of the cutoff @xmath56 , we can find values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 that fix the virtual state energy and the vertex functions at their physical values .",
    "we regard this as a positive feature of the separable potential , as it permits us to fix one of the parameters , usually @xmath83 , at an arbitrary , and possibly convenient , value , and then solve for the others .    the only task remaining to complete the definition of the separable pairing potential is to extend the potential , which we have defined in the vacuum , to finite values of the baryon density .",
    "this is done by observing that , as the retardation terms in the pairing potentials have been neglected , the dependence of the pairing field on the baryon density is completely determined by the density dependence of the components of the anomalous density , @xmath61 , @xmath125 and @xmath63 , in eq.([paireq ] ) . consequently , the separable pairing potential for finite baryon densities must be the same as the potential in the vacuum .",
    "the self - consistency equations for the components of the pairing field are thus given by eqs .",
    "( [ paireq ] ) and ( [ eq : s8 ] ) , with the parameters @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath83 ( and , eventually , @xmath128 as well ) fixed by the vacuum solution .",
    "we have compared calculations of the pairing fields obtained using a separable interaction with the usual dhfb results for various sets of @xmath129 interaction parameters .",
    "the relativistic separable potential describes well both the gap parameter , @xmath130 , and the two large components , @xmath109 and @xmath131 , at all baryon densities .",
    "it also reproduces the behavior of the pairing field @xmath16 for increasing values of the momentum cut - off @xmath56 in the self - consistency equations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the particular results for the @xmath99 interaction of bouyssy _",
    "et.al._@xcite , for a cut - off of @xmath132 3.8 @xmath96 , obtained by adjusting the virtual state energy to its physical value . this potential has been chosen because its vacuum gap function , which is the nonrelativistic two - nucleon vertex function , is in good agreement with the nonrelativistic two - nucleon vertex function calculated with the bonn - b potential@xcite .",
    "we note a difference of at most a few percent between the components of the relativistic fields obtained in exact and separable calculations .",
    "the differences in the two gap functions are even smaller .",
    "similar results are obtained for other sets of @xmath99 interaction parameters@xcite .    as discusses above",
    ", it is possible to adjust the strengths @xmath133 and @xmath134 of the separable interaction to fit the experimental value of the two - nucleon virtual state energy as a function of the cutoff @xmath83 .",
    "for each value of the @xmath83 , the resulting values of the strengths @xmath126 and @xmath127 yield a separable potential which carries the physical information necessary for the correct evaluation of the gap parameter at all values of the density . since the properties of the virtual state dominate the physics of @xmath0s@xmath1 pairing , we would expect the pairing fields that result to be independent of the cutoff used .",
    "we can verify the extent to which this is true by comparing the results obtained for @xmath135 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s11 ] ) , the common factor determining the overall magnitude of the pairing fields , at different values of the momentum cutoff @xmath83 .",
    "we do this in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we display the factor @xmath135 as a function of the fermi momentum for several values of the cutoff @xmath83 .",
    "we find the form of the factor @xmath136 to be fairly constant but its magnitude to decrease between 5 and 10 % as the momentum cutoff @xmath83 increases from 3.3 @xmath96 to 10 @xmath96 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strong correlation between the magnitude of the pairing gap and the energy of the two - nucleon virtual state was observed in all the meson potentials studied there .",
    "the correlation is reproduced , for all values of the cut - off , when using the corresponding separable potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we compare the correlation for the gap parameter , @xmath137 , obtained with the separable interaction with the exact result , using the @xmath99 parameters of ref.@xcite .",
    "the agreement between the two is excellent , confirming once again the goodness of the separable approximation to the pairing interaction .",
    "we thus conclude that a separable interaction obtained by exploiting the close relationship between the dirac pairing field and the virtual state vertex function furnishes an excellent description of the dirac pairing fields at all values of the baryon density .",
    "we next plan to implement a configuration - space version of the separable interaction in a dhfb code for finite nuclei calculations .",
    "we expect that such a potential will describe the short - range pairing correlations with greater accuracy than those obtained with the usual constant gap assumption .",
