    "the ehrenfest model of diffusion ( named after the austrian dutch physicists paul and tatiana ehrenfest ) was proposed in the early 1900s in order to illuminate the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics and to study the applicability of the boltzmann equation . in the ehrenfest wind - tree model * @xcite * , the point - like (  wind  ) particles move on a plane and collide with randomly placed fixed square scatterers (  tree  ) .",
    "+ this model has been recently reconsidered in * @xcite * to prove that microscopic chaos is not necessary for brownian motion .",
    "a one - dimensional version of this model has been considered in * @xcite * to investigate the origin of diffusion in non chaotic systems . in * @xcite * the authors identify two sufficient ingredients for diffusive behavior in one - dimensional , non - chaotic systems : a ) a finite - size , algebraic instability mechanism , and b ) a mechanism that suppresses periodic orbits .",
    "a nonequilibrium modification of the model , with regularly placed scatterers , has been proposed in * @xcite * to test the applicability of the so called fluctuation relation ( * @xcite * ) to non chaotic systems .",
    "this modified model was chosen under the assumption that , at small and vanishing fields at least , it must be non - chaotic , since collisions with flat boundaries do not lead to exponential separation of nearby phase space trajectories .",
    "+ however the question of whether such a model can have positive lyapunov exponents , as functions of the field , is open . indeed ,",
    "the techniques so far developed , e.g.  by chernov and wojtkowski * @xcite * , rely on the dispersing nature of the billiard obstacles . + in this paper , the dynamical properties of the nonequilibrium version of the ehrenfest gas are considered as functions of the field and of the parameters which determine the billiard table .",
    "numerical tests are performed to find chaotic attractors and to compute the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the construction of a sort of bifurcation diagram of the attractor as a function of the electric field and of the geometry is attempted .",
    "the result turns out to be quite peculiar : chaotic regimes with an extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters appear possible , although not easy to establish rigorously . if this model can be taken to approximate the transport of matter in microporous membranes , our results confirm the sensitive dependence of microporous transport on all relevant parameters observed e.g.  in * @xcite*. indeed , the current of the nonequilibrium eherenfest gas is proportional to the sum of the lyapunov exponents ( cf .",
    "below ) , which varies with the parameters as irregularly as the attractors do .",
    "the billiard table consists of rhombi of side length @xmath0 with distances along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions between the centers of two nearest neighbouring rhombi given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the centers of the rhombi are fixed on a triangular lattice in a plane and have coordinates    @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the lattice vectors . if all the pairs @xmath8 are selected , the billiard is invariant under the group of spatial translations generated by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the whole lattice can be mapped onto a so - called wigner - seitz cell , with periodic boundary conditions ( figure  [ elec ] ) .",
    "the elementary wigner - seitz cell of the triangular lattice is a hexagon of length side @xmath11 and area @xmath12 the centers of all other cells are identified by the pairs @xmath13 or @xmath14 where @xmath15 because of the bi  jective correspondence between rhombi and pairs @xmath8 , one may label a generic rhombus by @xmath16 and the corresponding hexagon by @xmath17 .",
    "further , a label can be put on the sides of the rhombi and of the hexagons , introducing an alphabet @xmath18 , starting from the right vertical side and oriented clockwise , for the sides of the rhombi and an alphabet @xmath19 for the hexagon sides , starting from the right vertical side and oriented clockwise . in this alphabet",
    ", the sides of a generic rhombus of the lattice can be labelled by a triple @xmath20 with @xmath21 , while the hexagon side with a triple @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the rhombi lying in the @xmath2 axes have @xmath24 with @xmath25 and the ones lying in the @xmath1 axes have @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "+ the geometry of the model is determined by the side @xmath11 of the hexagonal wigner - seitz cell , so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the rhombus with the center in the origin of the cartesian coordinates , @xmath0 its sides length , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the half length of the major and minor diagonals respectively , so that @xmath33 . to prevent the overlap of rhombi",
    ", the side length of the rhombus inside one hexagon has to verify    @xmath34 which implies @xmath35 .",
    "the case with @xmath36 corresponds to a billiard table which was recently considered in * @xcite*. + take @xmath37 , hence @xmath38 .",
    "the horizon of the billiard depends on the quantity @xmath32 and in particular on the difference @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , the horizon is finite ; if @xmath41 , it is infinite .",
    "the infinite horizon case allows collision - free trajectories , parallel to the @xmath42axis .",
    "+ when the dynamics is followed within to the wigner - seitz cell , the position of the point particle of mass @xmath43 must be supplemented by the couple @xmath8 , in order to determine its actual position in the infinite plane . the space between the rhombi forms the two - dimensional domain , in which the particle moves with velocity @xmath44 during the free flights , while collisions with the sides of the rhombi obey the law of elastic reflection .",
    "+ in order to drive the model out of equilibrium , an external electric field parallel to the x - axis , @xmath45 is applied .",
    "if there were no interaction with a thermal reservoir , any moving particle would be accelerated by the external field , on average , leading to an indefinite increase of energy in the system , and there would be no stationary state .",
    "therefore , in * @xcite * the particle has been coupled to a gaussian thermostat .",
    "the resulting model , with periodically distributed scatterers , has been called the _ non - equilibrium ehrenfest gas_. its phase space has four coordinates @xmath46 and its equations of motion are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the electric field and @xmath49 the gaussian thermostat .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 is known as the phase space contraction rate . because of the gaussian thermostat , @xmath51 is a constant of motion , hence there are only three independent variables , and one may replace @xmath52 and @xmath53 by the angle @xmath54 $ ] that @xmath55 forms with the @xmath1-axis . for sake of simplicity , we set @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "+ then , if @xmath58 denotes the position at time @xmath59 and @xmath60 the velocity angle , measured with respect to the @xmath1-axis , the trajectory between two collisions reads * @xcite * @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the time of the previous collision , while the collision map @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath60 is the incidence angle , @xmath58 is the collision point and @xmath65 is the angle that the side of the rhombus makes with the @xmath42axis .",
    "the sign @xmath66 depends on the side on which the bounce occurs .",
    "hence @xmath63 is piecewise linear in @xmath60 .",
    "+ considering the dynamics as a geodesic flow on a riemann manifold , the appropriate metric for this system is * @xcite *    @xmath67 which implies that the quantities @xmath68 and @xmath69 are conserved .",
    "also , the path length @xmath70 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 turns out to be    @xmath73",
    "using the symbols introduced above , a trajectory segment @xmath74 which consists of @xmath75 collisions can be labelled by a finite symbolic sequence such as @xmath76 , with @xmath77 or @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "periodic trajectories will be labelled by sequences which are infinitely many copies of a fundamental finite sequence .",
    "+ there are two types of periodic orbits ; those that are periodic in the plane , i.e. that return to the initial point in the plane ( they are _ closed _ : @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) and those whose periodicity relies upon the periodicity of the triangular lattice , and return to the same relative position in a different cell ( they are _ open _ : @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) .",
    "the velocity vectors of the closed orbits with two collisions have to be orthogonal to both sides of the rhombi where collisions occur .",
    "this implies @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the out - going velocity angle and @xmath88 the in - coming angle , because the absolute value of the velocity angle decreases and preserves the sign during the free flight * @xcite*. then , the closed period - two orbits fly between rhombuses in the same line parallel to the @xmath2-axes , and have period @xmath89 and length @xmath90 given by * @xcite * @xmath91 now , fix the geometry of the model through the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and take the initial conditions @xmath95 it is easy to show that the periodic orbits @xmath96 ( figure  [ open ] , left panel ) and @xmath97 , with electric field @xmath98 exist if and only if * @xcite * @xmath99 for open orbits with two collisions in the finite horizon case , simple algebra shows that the following symbolic representations @xmath100 and @xmath101 can not be realized .",
    "however , orbits with symbolic representation @xmath102 , and its symmetric counterpart @xmath103 ( figure  [ open ] , right panel ) do exist .",
    "their period is given by @xmath104    the open periodic orbits with four collisions ( figure  [ fig7 ] , left panel ) and symbolic sequence @xmath105 , and its simmetric image @xmath106 do exist if * @xcite * @xmath107    to compute the lyapunov exponents for these orbits and any other trajectory , consider the stability matrix @xmath108 for a trajectory as the product of free flight stability matrices @xmath109 and collision stability matrices @xmath110 @xmath111 the number of degrees freedom for the billiard map is two and the variables that we will use are @xmath112 .",
    "thus @xmath113 the free flight matrix @xmath109 depends on the side which the trajectory leaves and the one which it reaches .",
    "there are two different types of side , the ones with positive slope , of equation @xmath114 and the ones with negative slope , of equation @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are real numbers .",
    "+ let us compute the free flight matrix @xmath118 of a trajectory which goes from a side with positive slope to a side with negative slope .",
    "let @xmath119 and @xmath120 be the initial condition on a side with positive slope and the final condition on a side with negative slope respectively . by using the equations of the trajectory and by the implicit function theorem * @xcite",
    "* we obtain the jacobian matrix of the free flight : @xmath121 similarly , the flights from a side with negative slope to a side with positive slope yield @xmath122 and those from one side to a parallel one yield @xmath123 if @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the eigenvalues of the stability matrix @xmath108 for a periodic orbit of period @xmath89 , the two lyapunov exponents are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and one obtains @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the current and @xmath130 is the corresponding displacement in the direction of the field * @xcite*. both the lyapunov exponents of the closed periodic orbits , with period two , vanish . indeed , consider that this periodic orbit has @xmath131 , hence @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , the stability matrix of these periodic orbits , which is @xmath133 , is given by @xmath134 whose determinant is 1 , while its trace vanishes .",
    "this , implies that both lyapunov exponents vanish .",
    "in this paper , a system is called chaotic when it has at least one positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "we note that the boundary of our system is not defocussing and the external field has a focussing effect , so the overall dynamics should not be chaotic in general , although it is not obviuos that this is the case for all values of the electric field @xmath48 . in this section",
    "we examine the stationary state and the lyapunov exponents , obtained by using the algorithm developed by benettin , galgani , giorgilli and strelcyn * @xcite * , for different values of @xmath48 , ranging from small to large fields .",
    "numerical simulations of the model starting with random initial conditions and electric field in the range @xmath135 $ ] have been initially performed for a trajectory of length @xmath136 collisions .",
    "the parameters chosen for the geometry are @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 which correspond to a case in which the angles of the rhombi are irrational w.r.t .",
    "@xmath140 , then , according to a conjecture by gutkin * @xcite * , the equilibrium version of this model , ( i.e. the @xmath141 case ) , should be ergodic . for simulations of @xmath142 collisions ,",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the fields which appear to lead to one positive lyapunov exponent cover a range larger than that which appears to correspond to two negative exponents .",
    "however , do @xmath142 collisions suffice for a generic trajectory to characterize the stationary state ? for the cases with two negative exponents the answer is affirmative , since the trajectory is clearly captured by an attracting periodic orbit .",
    "but the cases with one apparently positive exponent are not equally clear . as * @xcite",
    "* already noted , the doubt is that , starting from a generic initial condition , convergence to the steady state might be too slow to be discovered , for reasons which had not been investigated . indeed , even in cases in which convergence is observed",
    ", the particle often appears to peregrinate in a sort of chaotic quasi steady state for very long times , before eventually settling on a periodic or quasi - periodic steady state .",
    "@xcite * suggested this might always be the case .",
    "therefore , we extended the simulations of the cases with one apparently positive lyapunov exponent , up to @xmath143 collisions .",
    "the behaviour of the system still appears to be non trivial , in cases such as that of @xmath144 .",
    "furthermore , plotting the last @xmath145 iterates of a trajectory of length @xmath146 collisions , we cover a large fraction of the phase space , which appears quite close to that covered by the last @xmath147 iterates of a trajectory of @xmath143 collisions ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "+ the conclusion that a chaotic stationary state has been reached seems reasonable in this case , as the computed positive lyapunov exponent also indicates , having apparently converged to @xmath148 with three digits of accuracy , after only @xmath149 collisions .",
    "+ to strengthen this results , we have looked for an unstable periodic orbit embedded in the attractor , and we have found one periodic orbit of period four , which apparently lies in the attractor and has a positive lyapunov exponent ( figure  [ fig7 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the other possibility is that the orbit is isolated , and is separated from the attractor by such a small neighborhood that is numerically impossible to resolve .",
    "another interesting example is given by @xmath150 : the last @xmath151 points of a trajectory of length @xmath146 collisions are compared with the last @xmath145 points of the trajectory of length @xmath152 ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) . also in this case the stationary state seems to have been reached , and a periodic orbit of period four with one positive lyapunov exponent seems to be embedded in the attractor , similarly to the case of @xmath144 .",
    "the values of @xmath48 , of the initial conditions and the lyapunov exponents are reported in table i and ii .",
    "[ par - flat ]    .numerically computed lyapunov exponents for different trajectories and fields .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      numerical simulations of the model were performed starting with random initial conditions and considering the electric field in the interval @xmath153 $ ] , for trajectories of length @xmath136 .",
    "looking at figure  [ fi1 ] ( left panel ) we find more cases with one apparently positive lyapunov exponent than with two negative exponents .",
    "plotting the last @xmath145 points , in trajectories of length @xmath154 , for the electric fields that produced apparently positive lyapunov exponents , the situation is pratically the same as for large fields : some cases with one exponent that appeared to be positive after @xmath142 collisions eventually produce ( after @xmath155 collisions ) two negative exponents and a periodic or quasi - periodic steady state * @xcite*. we have further increased the number of collisions up to @xmath156 , but the exponent @xmath157 remained positive in most of the cases ( figure  [ fi1 ] , right panel ) and an apparently chaotic attractor was reached .",
    "the behaviour illustrated above is rather peculiar and calls for some explanation .",
    "how can it be that a steady state is so hard to reach in so many cases ? usually , convergence to an attracting periodic orbit occurs rather quickly , while doubts remain in some of the cases we considered even after @xmath158 iterations of the bounce map .",
    "therefore , we have investigated in greater detail the specific example with @xmath159 , @xmath137 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "one finds that the largest time dependent lyapunov exponent , @xmath162 , rapidly settles on a positive value , as if the trajectory had reached a chaotic attractor .",
    "however , for randomly chosen initial conditions , a striking and precise monotonic @xmath163 behavior sets in for @xmath157 , after a critical , typically large , time @xmath164 ( cf .  left panel of figure  [ fii1 ] ) , as if the trajectory had eventually collapsed on an attracting periodic orbit .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic value of @xmath157 is @xmath165 with an estimated error not larger than @xmath166 * * .",
    "the accuracy of this result is due to the fact that a sufficiently long simulation approaches an attracting periodic orbit to practically full numerical precision ; the lyapunov exponents can then be computed with analogous accuracy .",
    "this is particularly true in the present example , which turns out to have an attracting orbit made of only 19 points , whose initial condition , up to 12 digits accuracy , is given by @xmath167 , ( cf .",
    "right panel of figure  [ fii1 ] ) .",
    "for such a small number of points , numerical errors can not appreciably affect the result .",
    "in particular , no doubts remain , in this case , about the negative sign of both exponents , hence about the attracting nature of the orbit .",
    "the question now arises as to the shape and size of the basin of attraction @xmath168 of the asymptotic periodic orbit , because a particle with random initial conditions wonders around almost all phase space before falling inside this set .",
    "our analysis of the evolution of trajectories , with initial condition close to the attracting periodic orbit , shows that @xmath168 is quite limited in size , and particularly hard to reach because it contains a very small region around the right vertex of the rhombus .",
    "furthermore , by varying the initial conditions around @xmath169 , and computing the lyapunov exponents , the irregular shape of @xmath168 is evidenced by the times @xmath170 , which vary most irregularly from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , @xmath172 being typical for random initial conditions . nevertheless , the _ radius _ of @xmath168 , i.e.  the supremum distance between any two points of @xmath168 , is not smaller than @xmath173 , which is quite small but well above the distances which can be accurtely measured with double precision numerical simulations .",
    "we conclude that @xmath168 lies at the border of a chaotic repeller * @xcite * , and that it is quite small and of irregular shape .",
    "hence , only after a sufficiently long peregrination in phase space , when the transiently chaotic trajectory gets sufficiently close to @xmath168 , may numerical errors let the trajectory jump inside @xmath168 . at this stage , the sudden ( exponential ) convergence of the trajectory and the consequent @xmath163 behaviour of the lyapunov exponents begin .",
    "the same qualitative behaviour has been observed for @xmath1740.002 , 0.003 , 0.004 , 0.005 , 0.006 , 0.007 , 0.010 , 0.022 , 0.040 , 0.041 , 0.042 , 0.043 , 0.050 , 0.064 , 0.065 , 0.073 , 0.087 .",
    "it is interesting to understand the behaviuor of the steady state with the field , i.e. to build a kind of bifurcation diagram , e.g.to compare with the one for the lorentz gas , whose obstacles are defocussing * @xcite*. our analysis reveals substantial differences from the case of * @xcite * , as well as from standard low dimensional dynamics .      in order to visualize the behaviour of the attractor as a function of the electric field",
    ", we consider a projection of the billiard map phase space : the projection onto the @xmath65 axis , which shows a sort of `` multi - furcation '' scenario .",
    "when the field is varied , a series of dramatic changes in the dynamics occurs .",
    "+ for the geometry determined by @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , numerical simulations were performed for a random initial condition , ignoring the initial transient behaviour , for the electric fields in the range @xmath175 $ ] with a step @xmath176 . at the end of a trajectory of @xmath142 collisions ,",
    "the last @xmath177 points were plotted ( figure  [ bif001 - 1 ] , presents only the upper half projection onto the @xmath65 axis ; the other half of this diagram is trivially obtained from this , by reflection along the line @xmath178 , as a result of the symmetry imposed on the system by the external field ) . in this way , many electric fields are found whose dynamics sample most of the @xmath65 space , while only a few fields show a periodic ( or quasi periodic ) steady state . the apparently chaotic regions and the regular regions are finely interspersed with each other , in a way which we have not found elsewhere in the literature .",
    "+ we have performed simulations also in the range @xmath179 $ ] and have only plotted the last @xmath177 points out of @xmath142 collisions , as in the previous case . in this range ,",
    "all attractors have been found to be periodic orbits , which are reached well before @xmath142 collisions . in other words , the stationary state is rapidly reached with large electric fields as expected for the correspondingly high dissipations .",
    "+ how conclusive are these results ? again , when a periodic steady state is reached , the situation is clear , while doubts remain when the steady state looks chaotic .",
    "therefore we have considered the range @xmath180 $ ] : a rather wide range , apparently chaotic , but also characterized by high dissipation , which favours ordered dynamics . running trajectories of @xmath181 collisions and plotting the last @xmath177 points , the apparently weakly chaotic states survived , despite the high dissipation .",
    "this study combined with the analysis of the largest lyapunov exponent makes chaos quite plausible for these fields , although we can not exclude that the trajectories collapse on periodic orbits after much longer times . on the other hand",
    ", there is no purpose in pushing further this analysis , since it is bound to remain uncertain . here",
    ", it suffices to have uncovered a rather peculiar behaviour , unexpected for simple dynamical systems .",
    "+ indeed , in our model , the passage from low - period attractors to apparently chaotic steady states , is rather abrupt and seems to be discontinuous .",
    "moreover , the periodic attractors always seem to coexist with transiently chaotic states .",
    "differently , standard bifurcation scenarios are characterized by a gradual growth of the period of the attracting orbits , the orbits are _ globally _ attracting and lead to fast convergence of the trajectories towards them . to further investigate this behaviour ,",
    "we have honed the range @xmath182 $ ] with step @xmath183 simulating trajectories of @xmath181 collisions , finding a ( quasi ) periodic orbit at @xmath184 and another one at @xmath185 , with apparently chaotic trajectories in the middle .",
    "thus , we have further honed the range @xmath186 $ ] with a step of @xmath187 , to find that a jump from ( quasi ) periodic orbits to apparent chaos happens for a field variation of just @xmath188 .",
    "+ we have also performed simulations in the range @xmath189 $ ] , namely from the ( quasi ) periodic orbit at @xmath184 to an apparently chaotic case at @xmath190 . plotting the last @xmath177 points of trajectories of @xmath181 collisions , apparent chaos and ( quasi ) periodic orbits appear again to be finely intertwined .",
    "the range @xmath191 $ ] was similarly studied , and some of the cases that appeared to be chaotic after @xmath142 collisions , turned into ( quasi ) periodic after @xmath181 , but not all .",
    "therefore , the duration of the transients results exceedingly long in all cases , which is a manifestation of either very small basins of attraction , or of the smallness of the stable islands , whose size would then vary wildly with the field .",
    "although this is not conclusive evidence , our analysis supports the idea that there could be a discontinuous transition between chaos and regular motion , in the non - equilibrium ehrenfest gas .      in this section",
    "we outline the behaviour of the attractors as functions of one of the parameters which determine the shape of the billiard : @xmath31 .",
    "we take two electric fields ( one large and one small ) for which we had found apparently chaotic behaviours .",
    "+ let @xmath144 be the electric field , @xmath137 and @xmath139 ; we study the attractor reliance on @xmath192 $ ] with step @xmath193 .",
    "we considered trajectories of length @xmath142 collisions and looked at the last @xmath177 points .",
    "we found a complicated scenario , analogous to the one for the dependence on @xmath48 , as @xmath31 was varied . in the chosen range , there are more cases with apparently chaotic attractors than with ( quasi ) periodic steady states .",
    "increasing the number of collisions in each trajectory up to @xmath146 , we find that apparent chaos persists , in other words it seems that the effect of the electric field prevails on the geometry effects . to analyze more carefully this fact , we have honed the interval @xmath194 $ ] for @xmath31 , with step @xmath195 and for trajectories of @xmath181 collisions .",
    "a sudden transition between apparent chaos and periodic orbits happens at @xmath196 .",
    "+ for @xmath197 , @xmath31 was taken in @xmath198 $ ] with step @xmath193 , for trajectories of length @xmath142 collisions .",
    "we found that the situation is slightly different from the small field case .",
    "the apparently chaotic steady states occupy a smaller region of the phase space than the steady states of the @xmath144 case .",
    "for instance , the asymptotic state of @xmath197 seems to fill almost completely the space @xmath65 , differently from the case of @xmath144 . increasing the length of the trajectories up to @xmath146 collisions , various apparently chaotic cases reduce to ( quasi ) periodic orbits , while other survive . finally , we increased the number of collisions up to @xmath181 for @xmath197 again finding that some apparently chaotic cases turned into quasi periodic cases , while other survived .",
    "+ we conclude that the dependence of the attractors on the parameter @xmath199 is qualitatively similar to the dependence on @xmath48 , although at times the dependence on @xmath48 prevails .",
    "in this paper we have examined the non equilibrium version of the ehrenfest gas , which is a billiard model with an electric field and a gaussian thermostat , whose point particle moves in the plane and undergoes elastic collisions with rhomboidal obstacles .",
    "the motivation was to understand the dynamics of this nonequilibrium model , whose obstacles have flat surfaces , hence do not defocus the trajectories , while its thermostat , which makes dissipative the dynamics , does focus them * * .",
    "we have shown that periodic orbits with one positive lyapunov exponent embedded in what appear to be chaotic attractors , do exist .",
    "our numerical results have identified electric fields whose dynamics is strongly suggested to be chaotic , although conclusive results are out of reach at present , because of a very peculiar phenomena .",
    "the stationary state , even if attracting and trivial , requires very long times to be reached , because it coexists with a transiently chaotic state which covers most of the phase space .",
    "the dependence on the model parameters of the steady state behaviour also presents peculiar features which , to the best of our knowledge , have not been observed before : a very irregular , possibly discontinuous dependence of the attracting orbit , and/or of the size and shape of the stable islands , on @xmath48 and @xmath31 . the peculiarity remains even if it is eventually proved that all steady states are periodic , because of their coexistence with transiently chaotic states , and because of the consequent irregular behaviour of the convergence rates . as the sum of the lyapunov exponents is proportional to the travelled distance , cf .",
    "eq.([formula ] ) , very irregular transport properties are obtained as well , perhaps as irregular as those conjectured for other low - dimensional dynamical systems * @xcite*.",

    "<S> it is known that the non - equilibrium version of the lorentz gas ( a billiard with dispersing obstacles * @xcite * , electric field and gaussian thermostat ) is hyperbolic if the field is small * @xcite*. differently the hyperbolicity of the non - equilibrium ehrenfest gas constitutes an open problem , since its obstacles are rhombi and the techniques so far developed rely on the dispersing nature of the obstacles * @xcite*. we have developed analytical and numerical investigations which support the idea that this model of transport of matter has both chaotic ( positive lyapunov exponent ) and non - chaotic steady states with a quite peculiar sensitive dependence on the field and on the geometry , not observed before . </S>",
    "<S> the associated transport behaviour is correspondingly highly irregular , with features whose understanding is of both theoretical and technological interest .    </S>",
