    "the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) is a one - dimensional model of fermionic particles on a lattice . in this context , _ fermionic _ means that a site can not be occupied by more than one particle .",
    "when two particles are adjacent , they can interact in two ways : they can annihilate each other , or alternatively , they can create another particle on an adjacent lattice site .",
    "particles can also diffuse by hopping from one site to the next .",
    "the reactions of the pcpd model and their rates are given by : @xmath6    given a value for the diffusion coefficient @xmath7 , we can discern three different regimes depending on the annihilation rate @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath8 is very large , then annihilation dominates the process , and the particles on the lattice will die out quickly .",
    "this is the inactive phase . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath8 is very small , the particle creation reaction will ensure that ( with extremely high probability ) the system will maintain a high density .",
    "this is called the active phase .",
    "well into the active or the inactive phase , long - ranged interactions are absent , and both these regimes can therefore be described well by mean - field theory . however ,",
    "if the boundary between the active and inactive phase is approached from either side , length and time scales diverge in a power - law fashion . in analogy with equilibrium phase transitions ,",
    "one expects that the system then exhibits critical behaviour in the transition between these regimes , at the critical value @xmath9 . from equilibrium statistical physics",
    "it is well established that phase transitions can be classified in universality classes , each of which characterized by a unique set of critical exponents . moreover , these exponents are typically insensitive to small changes in the model , such as details of short - ranged interactions . a central question in non - equilibrium statistical physics",
    "is whether also dynamical phase transitions can be classified into universality classes , which also are insensitive to such small changes .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the scaling relations concerning the particle density @xmath0 , which are given by :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the distance from criticality , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two of the critical exponents of the pcpd system . a conjecture by grassberger @xcite and janssen @xcite states that all systems with a single order parameter and a single absorbing state will belong to the universality class of the directed percolation ( dp ) model .",
    "the critical exponents of the one - dimensional dp model are known to very high accuracy ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the pcpd model have been disputed extensively , with estimates of @xmath12 ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and estimates of @xmath13 varying from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xcite . for a more extensive overview ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main interest in the pcpd model is whether it shares its critical exponents with dp , or not ; the latter would disprove the grassberger - jansen conjecture .",
    "the difficulties with the determination of the exponent @xmath12 of the pcpd model is that there are large finite - time corrections @xcite , and the effective exponent thus shows a drift with simulation time . in this paper",
    "we generate high - quality data , exploiting the computational power of graphics processing units ( gpus ) ; a description of the implementation will be published elsewhere .",
    "we then analyze these data in a way that suppresses the leading finite - time corrections .",
    "at criticality , the asymptotic decay of the density is described by a power - law of the form @xmath20 . for the dp model the corrections to this power - law decay very rapidly , and therefore @xmath21 is known with very high accuracy . however , as the history of the pcpd model shows , the density decay in the pcpd model does not show such a clean power - law in the time range accessible to computer simulations .",
    "consequently , one must account for finite - time corrections , in order to obtain an accurate estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "different finite - time corrections have been proposed in the past , including logarithmic corrections @xcite and power - law corrections @xcite .",
    "our data suggest power - law corrections , so that the density decay at the critical point is given by    @xmath22    with @xmath23 . by differentiating the logarithm of the density vs. the logarithm of the time",
    ", one can define an effective decay exponent as    @xmath24    note that in the limit of infinite time , the effective exponent @xmath25 approaches the true asymptotic value @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the direction from which it approaches the asymptotic value is governed by the sign of @xmath26 , and the speed of convergence by the gap @xmath27 .    at this point",
    ", we want to make some practical remarks :    \\i ) in practice with simulation data , the differentiation is carried out numerically , and one makes the approximation @xmath28 .",
    "\\ii ) when simulation measurements of @xmath25 are presented , it is usually more convenient for the eye if the presentation is such that the infinite - time behavior is inside the plot , rather than at infinite distance .",
    "a common approach to achieve this , is to plot @xmath25 as a function of @xmath29 ; this is not a good idea !",
    "if the gap is less than 1 , the approach to the vertical axis will eventually become infinitely steep , and it is hard to predict how far an infinitely steep curve will shoot up ( or down ) .",
    "ideally , one should therefore plot @xmath25 as a function of @xmath30 , as then the approach to the vertical axis will follow a straight line ( and indirectly provide information on @xmath27 ) . alternatively",
    ", one can plot @xmath25 as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "\\iii ) besides the particle density @xmath0 , another numerically accessible quantity is the pair density @xmath2 , defined as the fraction of neighboring sites , both of which are being occupied by a particle . for the pair density at the critical point , relations equivalent to eqs.([eq : cor ] ) and ( [ eq : eff ] ) can be defined .",
    "barkema and carlon  @xcite provided numerical evidence that the ratio of the densities of single particles and pairs tends to a constant ; further on in this paper we will confirm this .",
    "this has as a consequence that the asymptotic density decay of singles and pairs is governed by a unique exponent @xmath12 .",
    "also , this means that as long as the effective exponents @xmath25 and @xmath32 do not coincide , finite - time corrections are still significant .",
    "the first results , presented in figure [ fig : delta_eff ] , are measurements of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath0 , for values of @xmath8 close to the critical point , on either side .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath25 approaches its asymptotic value from above . assuming that at the end of our simulations , corrections are dominated by @xmath33",
    ", this indicates that @xmath34 is positive .",
    "furthermore , under this assumption , the maximal value of @xmath25 with a @xmath8 value lying in the inactive phase provides an upper bound for the asymptotic exponent : @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "this bound is less tight then the bound reported by hinrichsen@xcite , because it depends strongly on the maximal simulation time of the dataset , which was higher in hinrichsen s simulation , and less on the accuracy of the dataset , which is higher in our simulations .",
    "we do however confirm the conclusion of hinrichsen that most of the values reported for the exponent @xmath12 in pcpd are ruled out by this upper bound .",
    "interestingly , the data in figure [ fig : delta_eff ] are consistent with a linear convergence to an asymptotic value of @xmath37 .",
    "the most important conclusion drawn from this observation is that our data do not provide evidence of a violation of the grassberger - janssen conjecture ; and since the product of system size , length of the simulations , and the number of these is higher in our simulations than in earlier studies which claim to provide evidence for violation of the conjecture , our conclusion is that earlier claims of such violation based on numerical measurements of @xmath25 are ill - founded .",
    "a second observation is that the observed linear convergence indicates that @xmath38 and thus that @xmath39 .",
    "although our simulations are more extensive than those of earlier reports , the data is still not accurate enough to unambiguously rule out combinations of @xmath40 which are slightly different from @xmath41 ; in particular there is quite some ambiguity in @xmath33 .     as obtained for both the particle density @xmath0 ( colored black ) and the pair density @xmath2 ( gray ) , as a function of the particle density , with a diffusion factor @xmath42 . for @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", we found similar results .",
    "starting from low to high in the picture , the simulations are performed with @xmath45 ( 1600 runs ) , 0.15247 ( 3300 runs ) , 0.152475 ( 7400 runs ) and 0.152485 ( 1000 runs ) .",
    "the lattice contained @xmath46 sites .",
    "each simulation reached a time of approximately @xmath47 .",
    "the curve for @xmath48 is closest to the critical value , which we estimate to be @xmath49 .",
    "the straight line signifies a possible extrapolation to @xmath50.,width=377 ]    we now turn to an accurate estimation of the critical point @xmath9 . for this , we want to capitalize on our numerical knowledge on the value for the correction exponent @xmath33 , to suppress finite - time corrections .",
    "we do so by defining an adjusted density :    @xmath51    for some assumed value of @xmath33 .",
    "asymptotically , the densities @xmath52 and @xmath53 at the critical point will coincide , but at long but not infinite times , the corrected density suppresses correction terms with exponents @xmath54 close to @xmath33 ; with the correct numerical choice for @xmath33 the first correction term will even be completely removed , and for a reasonable approximation of @xmath33 , the power - law decay of @xmath53 should be much cleaner than that of @xmath52 .",
    "figure [ fig : cor ] shows the corrected density and corrected pair density as a function of time in a log - log plot , with the choice @xmath55 .",
    "this gives us the estimate @xmath56 .",
    "we conclude that the choice of @xmath33 tightly defines our estimates of both @xmath12 and @xmath9 .",
    "( black ) and corrected pair density @xmath57 ( gray ) as a function of time , for @xmath43 , @xmath58 ( dashed ) ; @xmath42 , @xmath48 ( solid ) ; and @xmath44 , @xmath59 ( dotted - dashed ) . in the correction procedure",
    ", we used @xmath60 and a lattice size of @xmath46 .",
    "the thick black line shows a possible line with @xmath50.,width=377 ]    an accurate method to determine the critical point @xmath9 is to use a data collapse method on the corrected density @xmath61 .",
    "the data collapse method maps the dataset with off - critical @xmath8 values onto a single curve for @xmath62 and a second curve for @xmath63 , if we select the correct values for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 . to achieve this , the ( pair ) density and the time",
    "are rescaled as follows :    @xmath64    using the diffusion factor @xmath42 , we obtain a very good data collapse , shown in figure [ fig : collapse ] .",
    "we find that the critical value is @xmath49 .",
    "our estimate of the exponent @xmath13 is less precise then our estimate of @xmath12 : @xmath65 , which is consistent with the value known for dp : @xmath66 .",
    "the fact that the curve for @xmath67 shows a statistically significant increase , after reaching a ( pseudo-)equilibrium , indicates that the corrections due to finite time and due to off - critical values for @xmath8 are not simply additive : our procedure to suppress the leading finite - time corrections at @xmath9 is not working equally well for the off - critical curves .",
    "the ` best ' value we find for @xmath13 is therefore still experiencing significant corrections to scaling .     at @xmath42 .",
    "the rescaled corrected density is plotted as a function of rescaled time ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : collapse ] ) ) .",
    "the data are obtained from the same simulations as in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_eff ] ; added to these data are simulations with @xmath68 ( 500 runs on a smaller lattice with @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 ( 1000 runs ) , @xmath71 ( 1000 runs ) , @xmath72 ( 500 runs ) and @xmath73 ( 1000 runs ) . in the correction procedure",
    ", we used @xmath60 . in the rescaling , we used @xmath74 and @xmath66 as in the dp model , combined with @xmath75.,width=377 ]    the question that remains",
    "is how these parameters depend on our choice for @xmath33 .",
    "we used the same methods described above to obtain estimates with @xmath33 ranging from 0.319 to 0.5 .",

    "@xcite the leading correction term @xmath76 was removed by using a linear combination of the density @xmath0 and the pair density @xmath61 .",
    "this is a valid strategy as long as the dominant correction term ( @xmath77 ) does not cancel in the ratio @xmath78 . in that case",
    "this ratio will asymptotically go to a constant with a power law ( at criticality ) :    @xmath79    thus , if the density ratio @xmath78 is plotted against @xmath80 , one should find a straight line ( with finite - time corrections from higher - order correction terms ) .",
    "since we found previously that @xmath3 , we have plotted the ratio versus the density @xmath0 in figure [ fig : rat ] .",
    "the density ratios for the three values of @xmath7 are clearly not approaching the vertical axis under a fixed angle in this plot , but seem to arrive horizontally at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we find that the leading correction disappears in the ratio and the method described in @xcite fails .",
    "we plotted the ratio against @xmath82 and we found that the most straight line has a value of @xmath83 .",
    "the large discrepancy between @xmath33 and @xmath84 increases our confidence in the fact that the correction term @xmath76 vanishes in the ratio @xmath78 .     of the particle and pair densities , as a function of the particle density .",
