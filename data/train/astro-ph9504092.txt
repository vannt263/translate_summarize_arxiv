    "the availability of large spectral archives and the efficiency achieved with modern instrumentation require automated classification methods to improve the classification by visual inspection .",
    "these methods are still in exploratory phase ; the aims are clear , to devise an objective , repeatable and robust classification scheme providing an estimation of systematic and random errors , and allowing the quantification of spectral resolution and signal to noise ratio on classification errors .",
    "automated classifiers of stellar spectra can be divided into metric distance algorithms , multivariate statistics and artificial neural networks ( hereafter ann ) .",
    "metric distance methods were originally proposed by kurtz and lasala ( kurtz @xcite , @xcite , lasala @xcite ) and have been used by penprase ( @xcite ) to classify stellar spectra using the digital spectral atlas of jacoby et al .",

    "multivariate statistical methods are linear algorithms used for exploratory data analysis .",
    "these methods have been applied to spectral classification by using principal component analysis ( pca ) to reduce the dimension of the problem , followed by cluster analysis ( ca ) to discover groups of objects in the parameter space obtained in the previous step ( murtagh & heck @xcite and references herein ) .",

    "@xcite ) allows the application of pattern recognition methods to explore the ultraviolet domain .",
    "the analysis of this archive is especially interesting , due to the homogeneity of the sample . as indicated by heck ( @xcite ) ,",
    "it is important to remember at this point that mk spectral classifications defined from the visible range can not simply be extrapolated to the ultraviolet spectral range .",
    "so far , only multivariate statistical methods have been used with iue spectra .",

    "the present work has been done within the context of the iue final archive project .",
    "the aim is to provide an efficient and objective classification procedure to explore the complete iue database , based on methods that do not require prior knowledge about the object to be classified .",
    "two methods are compared : a simple metric distance method , and a supervised ann classifier .",
    "the input sample and data preparation steps are described in sect .  2 .",
    "the classification method based on metric distance is summarized in sect .",
    "section 4 explains the classification method using ann .",
    "the results obtained with both methods are described in sect .  5 , and the conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "the spectra were taken from the iue low - dispersion reference atlas of normal stars ( heck et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter the atlas ) , covering the wavelength range from 1150 to 3200  .",
    "the atlas contains 229 normal stars distributed from the spectral type o3 to k0 .",
    "the classification given in the atlas was carried out following a classical morphological approach ( jaschek & jaschek @xcite ) , based on uv criteria alone .",
    "the set of 64 standard stars selected in the atlas , with spectral types from o3 to g5 , was used as a template in the metric distance classification and was the training sample in ann classification .",
    "the test set contained 163 spectra , excluding the 64 standard stars and two stars with spectral types g8 and k0 , outside the spectral types covered by the training set .",
    "the spectra were obtained by merging together data from the two iue cameras , sampled at a uniform wavelength step of 2  , after processing with the standard calibration pipeline .",
    "although the spectra are good in quality , there are two aspects that seriously hinder the automated classification : interstellar extinction and contamination with geo - coronal ly-@xmath0 emission .",
    "some pre - processing was required to eliminate these effects and to normalize the data .",
    "all spectra were corrected for interstellar extinction by using seaton s ( @xcite ) extinction law . due to the properties of the extinction law at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3  the color excess @xmath4 was estimated as    @xmath5 \\,.\\ ] ]    the observed fluxes @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 were obtained by filtering the high frequency components in the transformed fourier space ( lasala and kurtz @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dered-2 ] shows a typical o4 spectrum before and after correction for reddening .",
    "the region below 1250   was excluded from the analysis , to eliminate the geo - coronal ly-@xmath0 component , and also the spectral band from 1950 to 2350  , because of the low signal to noise ratio in this region .",
    "the selected wavelength range is indicated by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dered-2 ] .",
    "the resulting spectra contained @xmath9 flux values , which were normalized to obtain a mean flux value of zero and a sum of the absolute values of the normalized fluxes equal to one .",
    "normalized spectra are considered vectors in @xmath10 and a metric is introduced in the vector space . in this classification scheme the metric distance between the object spectrum and each spectrum in the training set is computed and the spectral class of the star in the training set having the minimum distance is assigned to the object .",
    "let @xmath11 be the flux of the @xmath12-th star in the catalogue and @xmath13 be the flux of the @xmath14-th standard star in the training set , after correction for reddening and normalization .",
    "the distance , @xmath15 , is defined by @xmath16",
    "a supervised classification scheme based on artificial neural networks ( ann ) has been used .",
    "this technique was originally developed by mccullogh and pitts ( @xcite ) and has been generalized with an algorithm for training networks having multiple layers , known as back - propagation ( rumelhart et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in a general form ,",
    "a neural network represents a function , @xmath17 , that maps a given input set into a selected output set . assuming that normalized spectra are elements in a @xmath18-dimensional vector space and spectral classes are defined by @xmath19-dimensional classification vectors , the network approximates the mapping @xmath20 , in such a way that a standard star , @xmath21 , is associated with the vector @xmath22 .",
    "the output vector defines the spectral class so that o0 is given by @xmath23 , o1 is represented by @xmath24 and so on . in this form",
    ", the network can be regarded as a classifier that maps the input space of normalized fluxes into @xmath25 , i.e. , one output unity and all others zero . such a network , with a squared - error cost function , gives a good estimation of bayesian probabilities ( richard & lippmann @xcite ) , so that for an input spectrum @xmath26 , the @xmath12-th component of the output vector is the probability @xmath27 for class @xmath12 given the input spectrum .",
    "the supervised classifier works in two phases : during a first step , the learning phase , the classifier is trained with the standard stars in the atlas together with the associated output vectors defining the spectral classes . in a second step , the test sample is presented to the network and spectral types are assigned as defined by the maximum value of the probability distributions estimated by the classifier .",
    "the network architecture consists of an input layer , one or more hidden layers and the output layer .",
    "the input layer contains @xmath18 nodes that accept the individual components of the input vector and distribute them to the nodes in the second layer .",
    "nodes in a layer receive the weighted sum of the output from all the nodes in the previous layer , so that the input of node @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the output of node @xmath12 in the previous layer and @xmath31 is the weight associated to the connection of node @xmath12 to node @xmath28 .",
    "the output of node @xmath28 is computed using the sigmoid transfer function @xmath32    during the training phase , input vectors with normalized fluxes of the standard stars are presented to the network and eqs .",

    "set , the output vector @xmath33 is compared with the desired classification vector @xmath34 , defining the spectral type of the standard star , and the error is evaluated as @xmath35    the minimization of the error is achieved during the training phase by changing the connection weights according with the error feedback mechanism , known as back - propagation ( rumelhart et al .",
    "@xcite ) . during this step ,",
    "connection weights @xmath31 are updated using the rule : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the learning rate , @xmath0 is the momentum factor to reduce oscillations during the learning process , @xmath38 is the iteration number and @xmath39 is the error , given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : rum-3 ] ) , to control the convergency of the procedure .",
    "after 2000 iterations there was no substantial improvement in the classification . to prevent excessive corrections during the first iterations ,",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath0 were linearly increased with the iteration number , reaching the operational values of 0.1 and 0.5 , respectively , after 100 iterations .    in our study",
    "we have used several network configurations , with an input layer consisting of @xmath9 nodes , corresponding to the number of spectral flux values , one or two hidden layers and an output layer having @xmath40 output nodes .",
    "a total of six different network topologies were used in the study with 30 , 60 and 120 nodes in the hidden layers . in addition , different output distributions were used during the training phase , by convolving the discrete @xmath41 functions representing the class probabilities with gaussian distributions having different standard deviations .",
