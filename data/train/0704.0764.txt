    "the interest in helical and chiral phases of frustrated low - dimensional quantum magnets has been triggered by recent experimental results . while many copper - oxide based materials predominantly realize antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , several candidate materials with magnetic properties believed to be described by frustrated ferromagnetic chains have been identified,@xcite including rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ref .  ) , licuvo@xmath3 ( refs .  ) , and li@xmath0zrcuo@xmath3 ( ref .  ) .",

    "the algebraic decay of the nematic correlator as opposed to the exponential decay of ( [ eq : sstrans ] ) suggests that there are tendencies towards nematic ordering in this phase .",
