    "recent years have seen the introduction of a number of fast `` order - n '' methods for calculating electronic properties , total energies , and forces corresponding to complex atomic configurations in materials .",
    "the major motivation behind these is to be able to perform molecular - dynamics type simulations with forces that correctly reflect the electronic structure .",
    "the methods have used a broad range of physical approaches .",
    "the earliest ones involved local solution of the schroedinger equation in different regions of space,@xcite and discretization of the kinetic - energy operator combined with subsequent recursion - based calculation of the electronic green s function.@xcite later methods include transformation of the kohn - sham equations to a localized - orbital representation,@xcite an iteratively obtained description of the occupied subspace,@xcite and two approaches in which the electronic density matrix is explicitly solved for in a sparse representation.@xcite    the present method builds on the last two references .",
    "the density matrix is an operator that contains all of the information about the electronic wave functions . for a review of the density matrix in molecular systems ,",
    "see ref .",
    "one of the earliest applications of the density matrix to condensed - matter systems was by smith and gay.@xcite because the density matrix decays ( although not necessarily very rapidly ) as a function of separation , a truncation can be used to obtain an order - n method .",
    "using a variational principle@xcite for the density - matrix together with a `` purification scheme''@xcite and a closely related approach@xcite order - n methods for tight - binding models have been developed .",
    "the variational density - matrix method has the advantage over recursion - type methods , which are also order - n , that forces which are the exact derivatives of the total energy are straightforwardly obtained in an analytic fashion .",
    "however , in refs .  5 and 6 convergence with respect to the assumed range of the density matrix was found to be fairly slow .",
    "this paper presents a generalization of the variational density - matrix method to general local potentials in one dimension . in section",
    "ii , i describe the mathematical formalism .",
    "it uses a trial density matrix which is based on travelling orbitals built out of linear combinations of harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions , together with the `` purification scheme '' mentioned above .",
    "the method becomes progressively more accurate as one includes more orbitals per spatial mesh point .",
    "for one basis orbital per mesh point , one has only one piece of information per mesh point , and in this sense the theory is mathematically analogous to the thomas - fermi theory ( although the kinetic - energy is a nonlocal functional of the electron density in the present case , as opposed to a local one in the thomas - fermi theory ) . as more orbitals are included , one carries more information per mesh point and thus has a richer description . in terms of the coefficients of the travelling basis orbitals , the total - energy function takes the form of a multicomponent cubic landau theory .",
    "density - functional theory has shown that it is possible to write the total ground - state energy of an electronic system entirely in terms of the electronic charge density .",
    "however , i do not follow this route here , because obtaining the kinetic energy in terms of the electron density is very difficult . in the density - matrix approach ,",
    "the kinetic energy is given as a straightforward linear function of the density matrix ; the prices that one pays for this simplicity are that one has to carry more variables per spatial mesh point , and deal with constraints that are difficult to implement .",
    "section iii describes applications to model one - dimensional systems .",
    "these include the noninteracting free - electron gas , the `` morse '' potential for bound states , a bimetallic `` interface '' between two different constant potentials , and a `` semiconductor '' defined by an oscillatory potential .",
    "the applications are intended to illustrate the basic physics of the method , and to establish whether the new approach contains several important physical phenomena which are hard to obtain in real - space total - energy functionals such as thomas - fermi theory or gradient - enhanced versions thereof .",
    "these phenomena include charge quantization in attractive potentials , friedel oscillations from potential perturbations , and band gaps in semiconductors .",
    "i find that the first two are realized in a very satisfactory fashion .",
    "the band gaps are realized in an approximate sense , in that a region of reduced electronic density of states is seen , but no actual band gap .",
    "section iv concludes the paper with an evaluation of the utility of the method , and a discussion of possible applications to the inclusion of electron - electron interactions and to embedding clusters of atoms in media with prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "the overall procedure is to minimize the energy with respect to a `` trial '' density matrix @xmath0 , from which the variational density matrix @xmath1 entering the total energy is obtained via a nonlinear `` purification '' transformation .",
    "the underlying variational principle@xcite states that the exact zero - temperature density matrix @xmath2 , for a system with given chemical potential @xmath3 , is the one which minimizes the functional tr@xmath4 , subject to the constraints that @xmath1 is real symmetric and all of its eigenvalues @xmath5 satisfy @xmath6 . note that although in the true density matrix , the eigenvalues are precisely @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it is not necessary to specify this as a constraint for the variational principle ; this is instead achieved automatically by the exact density matrix @xmath2 which minimizes the energy functional . in the present case of an approximate variational density matrix @xmath1 , the energy minimization does not lead to eigenvalues which are precisely @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but they are closer to these values than those of @xmath0 .",
    "the variational principle , as stated above , is difficult to use because the eigenvalue constraint is hard to implement .",
    "for this reason , a `` purification '' transformation has been developed which converts a wide range of trial density matrices @xmath0 into density matrices which are `` allowable '' in the sense that they satisfy the eigenvalue constraint .",
    "the transformation is as follows : @xmath9 the eigenvalues @xmath5 of @xmath1 are related to those of @xmath1 , @xmath10 , by @xmath11 so that if all of the @xmath10 are between -1/2 and + 3/2 , then all of the @xmath5 are between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath1 is allowable . because @xmath12 vanishes at @xmath13 and @xmath8",
    ", this transformation has the tendency to `` pile up '' eigenvalues around @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where they belong .",
    "i use the following representation for the trial density matrix @xmath0 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a length - scale parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 determines the number of basis orbitals used in the expansion , and at fixed @xmath16 determines the range and number of oscillations of the density matrix .",
    "note that the @xmath18 are linear combinations of harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "one can show straightforwardly from the symmetry @xmath19 that only even powers are needed in the expansion .",
    "the procedure for implementing the formalism is as follows .",
    "one first chooses values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 ( appropriate values are discussed below ) .",
    "one then chooses a mesh for @xmath37 and chooses initial values for @xmath20 on this mesh .",
    "the total number of variables is equal to @xmath38 times the number of mesh points .",
    "i have typically used free - electron initial values for @xmath20 .",
    "the integrals for the energy are evaluated numerically on the @xmath39-space mesh . because the variational density matrix generated in this fashion has gaussian decay at long distances,@xcite it is possible to regard it as truncated beyond some critical radius @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the numerical integral for the energy is of order @xmath41 .",
    "the energy minimization is performed using a conjugate - gradient procedure . for this procedure ,",
    "one requires the `` generalized forces '' , which are the derivatives of @xmath32 with respect to the values of @xmath25 at mesh points . because of the simple cubic plus quadratic form of eq .",
    "( 10 ) , these derivatives are straightforwardly obtained as numerical integrals similar to those for the energy .",
    "the conjugate - gradient algorithm is allowed to run until the generalized forces are of order @xmath42 atomic units .    because the energy is only a local minimum , not a global one , some choices of initial conditions and potentials @xmath30 lead to `` runaways '' in which the energy becomes negatively infinite because of unphysical negative occupancies of positive - energy states .",
    "it was found that this problem could be cured by adding a term proportional to @xmath43 ^ 2\\ , dx$ ] .",
    "this term vanishes if the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are precisely 0 or 1 .",
    "the actual energy corresponding to this term is quite small , since the eigenvalues of the minimizing @xmath0 are all close to 0 or 1 , but the term appears to prevent the runaways consistently .",
    "the main purpose of the applications is to establish the extent to which the new method obtains inherently quantum - mechanical effects that are not readily obtained in real - space total - energy methods , such as thomas - fermi type theories .",
    "these effects are charge quantization at localized potentials , friedel oscillations around scatterers , and band gaps in semiconductors . at localized potentials ,",
    "the thomas - fermi theory obtains a total charge that varies continuosly with the chemical potential ; the correct quantum - mechanical charge varies discontinuously with the chemical potential , with the discontinuities occurring at bound - state energies . around scattering potentials , the thomas - fermi theory obtains a smooth exponentially decaying charge density ; the correct density has a power - law decay with an oscillating prefactor .",
    "the density of states in thomax - fermi theory , defined as the derivative of the number of electrons with respect to the chemical potential , never displays gaps in periodic potentials , but rather is closely related to the free - electron density of states .",
    "in all of the applications , i use @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bohr radius .",
    "this value of @xmath16 , on the basis of trial calculations , provides a good compromise between a correct description at short distances and the need to obtain a sufficiently long range for the density matrix .",
    "the choice @xmath47 was then found to lead to numerically converged integrals .",
    "the value of @xmath17 was the highest value that i was able to use without running into numerical difficulties involving cancellations between large terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) .    to obtain the simplest picture of the physical significance of the approximations of the method ,",
    "i begin with the one - dimensional free - electron gas , with the chemical potential @xmath48  ry .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath50 ( which depends only on @xmath51 ) is shown in fig .  1 , along with @xmath52 and the exact density matrix @xmath53}/\\pi ( x - x')$ ] . at small distances ,",
    "both @xmath50 and @xmath52 are in excellent agreement with @xmath54 .",
    "the good agreement persists out until about 10  @xmath46 . beyond this point",
    ", @xmath50 becomes increasingly damped with respect to the @xmath54 , although substantial oscillations are still seen out to @xmath55 and beyond .",
    "note that @xmath52 decays more rapidly then @xmath50 , so that even on the expanded scale of fig .",
    "1b , the oscillations are almost invisible beyond 17  @xmath46 .",
    "this difference between @xmath50 and @xmath52 is due to the purification procedure ; the convolution implicit in eq .",
    "( 1 ) serves to increase the range of @xmath50 beyond that of @xmath52 .",
    "however , the purification makes up for only about half of the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure 2 shows the kinetic and total energy densities for the electron gas , as functions of @xmath17 . at @xmath56 ( only one variable per mesh point ) ,",
    "the results are quite inaccurate in comparison with the exact values",
    ". however , already for @xmath57 , considerable improvements are seen , and for @xmath58 , the agreement is quantitatively accurate .",
    "i now turn to the case of a bound state . because of its analytic tractability",
    ", i choose the potential @xmath59 this potential has one bound state wave function , @xmath60 , with eigenvalue @xmath61 .",
    "i consider the case @xmath62 and use @xmath63  ry , in comparison with the bound state energy of @xmath64  ry .",
    "the charge density for @xmath58 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . on the scale of the figure ,",
    "it is indistinguishable from the exact one . for this value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the total charge @xmath65 is 1.0001 , which is thus in error by only one part in @xmath66 .",
    "the bound - state energy of @xmath67  ry is also very close to the exact value .    to explore in more detail the nature of the charge quantization , fig .",
    "4 shows @xmath68 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the exact @xmath68 jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath64  ry .",
    "the @xmath68 obtained from the density matrix follows this behavior closely , except that it climbs to 1 over a narrow but finite range from about @xmath69  ry to @xmath70  ry . above @xmath70  ry",
    ", @xmath68 is very close to constant .",
    "the entire density matrix for @xmath63  ry is compared to @xmath71 in fig .",
    "the contour plots are essentially indistinguishable , the only visible difference being that the contours for the variational density matrix are somewhat more square close to the origin .",
    "thus all aspects of this bound - state problem seem to be described quite well by the approximate variational density matrix .",
    "our model for the one - dimensional model metallic interface has the step - function form @xmath72 i choose @xmath73  ry and @xmath74  ry , and consider the case @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding charge densities are indicated in fig .",
    "the approach to the bulk densities on either side of the interface is oscillatory as expected according to the standard friedel - oscillation theory .",
    "the wavelengths obtained by the variational density matrix are close to the expected wavelengths @xmath76 which have the values @xmath77 on the left and @xmath78 on the right .",
    "the main point of difference between the variational density matrix results and the exact ones is that the oscillations in the former case eventually have a gaussian decay , while the exact calculation gives a decay proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "our last example is a model semiconductor , defined by the potential @xmath80 as is well known , in a weak - scattering analysis this type of potential produces a band gap of magnitude @xmath81 , centered around the kinetic energy @xmath82 . around the band gap",
    ", the density of states @xmath83 per unit length ( in this one - dimensional case ) displays singularities of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 indicates the conduction- and valence - band edges .",
    "although the density matrix does not give the density of states directly , we can obtain @xmath83 by evaluating the dependence of the total charge @xmath86 on the chemical potential : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the system size .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath89  ry and @xmath90 , which in the weak - scattering theory would lead to a gap of width @xmath91  ry centered about @xmath8  ry .",
    "the calculated density of states is shown in fig .  7 , and",
    "is compared with the exact free - electron density of states .",
    "it is seen that in a region extending from about @xmath92  ry to @xmath93  ry , the density of states is considerably reduced . at @xmath94  ry , it is roughly six times smaller than the free - electron value .",
    "i term this effect a `` quasigap '' .",
    "the width of the quasigap is comparable to the free - electron prediction .",
    "also , on either side of the gap , pronounced increases in @xmath83 are seen , which are presumably connected with the square - root singularities of the true density of states .",
    "i do not know whether this variational density - matrix method actually can obtain square - root singularities .",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn from the above is that there exists an order-@xmath41 variational density - matrix method for calculating electronic structure , which obtains quantitative agreement with exact results in several cases .",
    "it contains several effects that are hard to extract from real - space density - based descriptions : charge quantization , friedel oscillations , and band - gap formation .",
    "one could straightforwardly combine such a method with the local - density approximation ( lda ) of density - functional theory by simply adding additional terms to the hamiltonian , to get a viable total - energy method .",
    "however , the use of the density matrix rather than the density as a basic variable may also make it feasible to develop improvements on the lda .",
    "it is probably easier develop a picture of the electronic pair correlations in the system from the density matrix rather than the density itself .",
    "for example , one knows that in insulators and semiconductors , the density matrix decays exponentially , with a decay rate determined by the band gap .",
    "thus knowledge of the decay rate of the density matrix may give some information about the excited - state spectrum of a material .",
    "i believe that another advantage of a method such as this one is that , because it uses an @xmath39-space representation , one can easily embed a calculation for a strongly distorted or disrupted piece of material into a host of material which is essentially perfect .",
    "one can simply specify that the @xmath25 in the perfect region have their perfect - lattice behavior , and allow them to vary arbitrarily in the disrupted region , subject to the boundary conditions . in this way , one can avoid the use of periodic boundary conditions , which are typically necessary in @xmath95-space representations .    the main hurdle to be treated before the extension to three dimensions and the inclusion of electron - interaction terms is to streamline the procedure to obtain greater computational efficiency .",
    "i find that with standard conjugate - gradient methods , achieving convergence with 900 variables ( 100 mesh points , nine variables per mesh point ) takes several minutes of computer time on a silicon graphics r4000 workstation . at this speed ,",
    "doing any but the simplest three - dimensional problems would be computationally prohibitive .",
    "two avenues are likely to help .",
    "the first is to speed up the numerical integrals . the computer time is dominated by the numerical integrals that are done in order to compute @xmath96 .",
    "it is possible that these can be speeded up by using an intermediate expansion step , in which @xmath97 is expanded in a form analogous to eq .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath0 .",
    "if such an expansion can be made , then the time required to compute @xmath96 could be reduced by an order of magnitude . the second avenue that might help is a speeding - up of the line searches in the conjugate gradient procedure .",
    "since the total energy is a cubic function of the underlying variables , the minimum along the line search can be precisely determined by knowing the forces at three points along the line.@xcite    i am grateful to murray daw and david vanderbilt for useful comments and advice , and to lilly canel for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
