    "gravitational lensing of electromagnetic waves is a well known phenomenon predicted by the general theory of relativity ( for a review on this issue see schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", gravitational lensing of gravitational waves should occur in the same way as it does for light .",
    "the most obvious difference is that gravitational wave propagation is not disturbed by dust grains , as happens for light , so that the central part of our galaxy may be investigated by using the next generation of gravitational wave detectors .    in a very interesting paper ruffa ( @xcite ) , assuming that the mass of the galactic center is in the form of a massive black hole with mass @xmath0 m@xmath1 ( for a galactic center overview see eckart , genzel , ott and schoedel @xcite ) , the gravitational wave lensing problem was studied by a typical fraunhoffer diffraction approach .",
    "it was pointed out ( ruffa @xcite ) that extra galactic sources can be amplified by a factor of about @xmath2 and galactic neutron stars by over @xmath3 .",
    "the author also argued that the earth would take about 10.1 days to traverse the focused region of the extra galactic sources . for galactic bulge sources the focused region",
    "would be scaled down by a factor of nearly 3 and hence the observing time would be reduced to about 3 days .",
    "the question that naturally arises is `` how likely is it that we see the proposed enhancement ? '' to answer this question we need to estimate the number of sources that could be expected to be observed , both galactic and extra - galactic . in principle , of course , there are many extra - galactic sources as there are @xmath4 galaxies .",
    "however , we need to limit the number , applying a cut - off by requiring that the expected intensity ( after amplification ) be greater than the sensitivity of the detector .    as will be seen , the chances of seeing the dramatic enhancement calculated by ruffa are extremely small .",
    "this is due to the fact that ruffa assumes a very special geometry , with the source , lens and observation point aligned . whereas ruffa considered fraunhoffer diffraction , an analysis using `` geometric optics '' for gravitational waves had been undertaken , in which the special geometry of ruffa was not assumed ( de paolis , ingrosso and nucita @xcite ) .",
    "this analysis gave a much higher probability but a lower enhancement .",
    "in this paper , we evaluate the probability of enhancement of the gravitational wave signals as a consequence of diffraction by massive compact objects in the highly aligned geometry .",
    "we also consider the lensing effect due to a possible companion star of the gravitational wave source in the framework of the classical microlensing theory .",
    "in addition to this case we consider the gravitational wave lensing due to the massive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "as we shall see , the gravitational wave signal amplification due to the companion object ( or the black hole at the galactic center ) might be detectable by the virgo detector for some orbital parameters of the binary system .",
    "let us assume that the observer , the lens and the source ( a spinning pulsar ) are on the same line . the lens will focus the gravitational waves that pass through the einstein radius @xmath5 to the earth in a region orthogonal to the line of sight . here",
    "@xmath6 is the distance between the observer and the lens ( @xmath7 kpc ) and @xmath8 is the lens - source distance .",
    "using diffraction theory , the focused area is determined by @xmath6 and the diffraction pattern for the circular annular region bounded by radii @xmath9 and @xmath9+@xmath10 .",
    "note that a gravitational wave that passes at the distance @xmath9+@xmath10 from the lens is focused in @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible to show ( by evaluating the 3 db points of the signal , see ruffa @xcite ) that the radius of the focused region is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational wave length .",
    "hz , the emitted gravitational waves has frequency @xmath14 hz ( see e.g. shapiro and teukolsky @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the gravitational wave length turns out to be @xmath15 cm . ]",
    "as pointed out by ruffa , the increase in intensity depends on the ratio ( known as the intensity ratio ) of the annular region bounded by the radii @xmath9 and @xmath9+@xmath10 to the focused region area .",
    "this can be determined by the system of equations cm and , from eq .",
    "( [ rhod ] ) , @xmath16 . ]",
    "@xmath17 we note that the first equation is ruffa s eq .",
    "( 4 ) at first order approximation ( since @xmath16 ) and the second one derives from differentiating the expression for the einstein radius @xmath9 with respect to @xmath6 . solving for @xmath18 , we finally obtain @xmath19 which reduces to @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "taking into account the previous equations and the expression of the einstein radius , the intensity ratio turns out to be @xmath22 implying a gravitational wave amplification factor is proportional to the square root of the energy flux , the enhancement in @xmath23 is proportional to the square root of the intensity ratio . ]",
    "@xmath24    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     assume now that ruffa s treatment still holds if the source is not fully aligned with the observer - lens line but forms at least an angle @xmath25 with it .",
    "consequently , the probability density of finding the source within a circular region of radius between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is proportional to the ratio between that circular area and the surface of the cylinder centered at the galactic center and having radius @xmath8 and height @xmath28 . from simple geometric considerations , this probability density , after integration over @xmath29 ,",
    "gives the following probability of finding a source within the radius @xmath30 @xmath31    on the other hand , the real probability to observe a gravitational wave enhancement in the case of the observer , lens and source on the same line of sight has to take into account also the number of expected sources behind the central black hole .    from an extrapolation of the neutron star ( ns ) birthrate ( narayan and ostriker @xcite ) yr ( tammann , loeffler and schroeder @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates do not take into account any sn rate evolution with time and the fact that only about @xmath32 of the historical sne have been close and bright enough to have been detectable by the naked eye , and therefore have to be considered as a lower limit to the inferred present galactic sn number .",
    "a more realistic estimate of the sn rate for our galaxy is about one over 20 years ( panagia @xcite ) .",
    "observations show that large late - type spiral galaxies produce about 10 sne per century ( tammann , loeffler and schroeder @xcite ) . ] and from the number of supernovae required to account for the heavy element abundance in the milky way ( arnett , schramm and truran @xcite ) , we expect that our galaxy contain @xmath33 nss . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the ns population has a usual disk - like shape , i.e. the number density profile is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 m@xmath1 pc@xmath36 , @xmath37 m@xmath1 , @xmath38 kpc and @xmath39 kpc is the typical length scale of the galactic disk . in order to consider the distribution of matter behind the black hole , equation ( [ probdistanza ] ) has to be multiplied by the factor @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the total volume of the disk . consequently , the probability to have an enhancement of the gravitational wave signal according to the mechanism proposed by ruffa is @xmath42    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we give the probability @xmath43 as a function of the source distance @xmath8 from the galactic center .",
    "as one can see , the probability to have a gravitational wave enhancement _ a la ruffa _ by the black hole at the galactic center from a pulsar in the line of sight to the galactic center is as low as @xmath44 per year .",
    "the total probability ( assuming that there are no pulsars closer than @xmath45 kpc to the galactic center ) is @xmath46 per year . in other words",
    ", we could expect to wait for a hundred times the age of the universe to see one !",
    "let us see now what happens in the case of a gravitational wave signal due to a supernova explosion in other galaxies behind the galactic black hole .",
    "since @xmath21 , in this case @xmath47 .",
    "the probability of a galaxy being within the focused region at a distance @xmath8 is simply @xmath48 .",
    "thus the total probability will go as @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , we only need to find the probability of a galaxy at the closest distance to be on the line of sight , i.e. the number density of galaxy does not matter .",
    "it is known that supernovae explode in typical galaxies less frequently than once every @xmath51 years .",
    "consequently , the relevant probability is @xmath52 per year .",
    "taking @xmath53 as 1 mpc , the probability is less than @xmath54 per year ! as such , there is no real likelihood of being able to see the ruffa enhancement .",
    "of course , there are also other expected sources of bursts of gravitational waves from gamma - ray bursts ( see e.g. ruffert and janka @xcite ) or binary systems ( see e.g. de paolis , ingrosso and nucita @xcite and references therein ) that could in principle be detectable by virgo ( jaranowski and krlak @xcite and passaquieti @xcite ) , ligo ( barish @xcite ) or lisa ( hiscock , larson , routzahn and kulick @xcite and vecchio @xcite ) experiments . however , from the discussion above , it can easily be calculated that the expected probability of seeing a gravitational wave amplification by the central black hole of one of such event is even less than @xmath54 per year .",
    "let us consider now the enhancement of the gravitational waves emitted by a rotating neutron star due to the microlensing effect of a companion star moving around the compact source on a circular orbit with radius @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be the masses of the pulsar and of the companion star , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the orbital plane of the binary star is inclined at an angle @xmath58 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the companion star coordinates , with respect to a reference frame with @xmath59 and @xmath60 axes on the orbital plane , are given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the orbital angle measured with respect to the positive direction of the @xmath59 axis pointing towards the observer .",
    "the distance between the companion star @xmath57 and the line of sight to the gravitational wave source turns out to be @xmath63 for a source - observer distance greater than the distance between the source and the lens ( @xmath64 ) , the einstein radius is @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , as in usual microlensing theory , the flux amplification factor is given by ( see e.g. schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite ) @xmath66 with @xmath67 . obviously , since the impact parameter @xmath68 depends on the position of the companion star on the orbit , we expect that the flux amplification @xmath69 is a periodic function of time with period @xmath70 .",
    "we also note that the effect of the amplification is maximal for @xmath71 .",
    "the expected gravitational wave amplitude enhancement is @xmath72 . in table",
    "[ tabella ] , assuming @xmath73 , the maximum flux amplification @xmath74 , the gravitational wave signal amplification @xmath75 and the microlensing event time - scale @xmath76 are shown for different values of the orbital parameters ( @xmath55 , @xmath43 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 ) . as",
    "one can note , the amplification effect decreases for increasing inclination angles while the event time - scale @xmath76 goes up .",
    "since the gravitational wave amplification is the same for a compact or a normal companion star , assuming that virgo will be able to detect only @xmath77 of the pulsars with spin period @xmath78 ms within about @xmath51 kpc from earth in three years of integration , one expects @xmath79 detectable binaries .",
    "therefore , the number of binary systems with plane inclination angle @xmath80 is easily found to be about 10 .",
    "of course , since the probability of having high enough amplification of the signal for long enough is expected to be rather small , the chances of having a really detectable amplified signal from a binary system are low .",
    "some higher probability is expected if the lens object is the black hole at the galactic center , due to its higher mass . in this case , as one can see from table [ tabella ] , both the signal amplification and duration are expected to be high enough to have a signal detectable by virgo . for details about the detectable gravitational wave amplitude see gourgoulhon and bonazzola @xcite .    finally , we want to note that the effects of the gravitational light deflection and amplification in eclipsing binary stars has been considered in detail ( marsh @xcite , beskin and tuntsov @xcite ) and by schneider ( @xcite ) for the binary pulsar 1957 + 20 as a way for determining the binary system parameters . actually ,",
    "the gravitational wave amplification is , if gravitational wave astronomy becomes practicable in the future , a much more powerful tool since gravitational waves are never shielded by the lens object ( as happens for light rays ) giving the unique possibility to trace the sources even in regions ( like the galactic center ) where light suffers strong absorption .",
