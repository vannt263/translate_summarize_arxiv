    "the physical properties of ( quasi-)one - dimensional electron systems are often very different from their 2d counterpart , for example , in ( spin-@xmath13 ) heisenberg antiferromagnets ( afm ) : the ( quasi-1d ) ladders exhibit in the groundstate an odd - even effect , i.e. , odd - leg ladders have one gapless spinon - mode , while even - leg ladders have a spin - gap  @xcite .",
    "the 2d heisenberg model however , has two gapless magnon - modes and long - range order  @xcite .",
    "similarly , ( quasi-)1d conductors are generally luttinger liquids ( ll )  @xcite , while 2d and 3d electron systems are ( usually ) fermi liquids ( fl ) .    for the afm heisenberg model , the dimensional crossover from 1d to 2d has been studied in ref .  @xcite . via the correspondence between number of legs @xmath0 and temperature @xmath14 , @xmath15",
    ", the nonlinear sigma - model allows one in this case to calculate various physical properties ; in particular , the spin - gap present in even - leg ladders vanishes exponentially as a function of the number @xmath0 of coupled spin - chains .",
    "coupled lls  @xcite and the dimensional crossover to 2d have been investigated by many different authors  @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons was the search for a non - fl ( i.e. , possible ll - like ) phase in 2d  @xcite .",

    "the dimensional crossover from 1d to 2d was only investigated _",
    "away _ from half - filling ( without umklapp and afm processes )  @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that the system becomes a fl for @xmath16 .    in a previous work ,",
    "we have studied in detail the groundstate properties of the half - filled and lightly doped @xmath17 and 4-leg hubbard ladders in the case of weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the large @xmath18 case , where the half - filled hubbard model converges onto the heisenberg model of spin-1/2 @xcite , in the small @xmath18 case , the _ charge degrees _ of freedom are still _ present _ , which gives insight in the effect of doping away from half - filling .    here",
    ", we analyze the crossover from 1d to 2d for the half - filled ( and lightly doped ) ladders .",
    "we will show that depending on the energy - scale ( respectively length - scale ) , the physical properties are very different and that the phases associated with these properties are separated by crossover energies which are a function of @xmath0 . in particular , the quasi-1d analog of the 2d phase is present at higher energies , implying that the crossover between _ different _ phases can be studied for @xmath0 _ finite_. an advantage in quasi-1d compared to the 2d case is the limited number of different interactions .",

    "it is the presence of interactions between bands @xmath208 and @xmath21 which are _ not _ `` paired '' ( @xmath209 ) , which renders the system a 2d - like afm .",
    "the effect of a decreasing @xmath24 is therefore that interactions between unpaired bands become suppressed and the afm correlations are reduced .",
    "next , we show that the effect of doping away from half - filling is a similar one , i.e. , the doping @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath210 .    at low dopings and at finite @xmath0 ,",
    "we can dope the system perturbatively by introducing a chemical potential term @xmath211 ( @xmath212 is the total charge ) in the half - filled low - energy hamiltonian , see ref .  @xcite . for the charge - sector , we can use bosonization , where the charge density is given by @xmath213 .",
    "doping then introduces _ kinks _ in the fields @xmath184 , such that the expectation value of cosine terms , which contain this field gradually goes to zero ( the kink is a fermionic , strongly localized particle ) . here , the kinks are bound hole - pairs of charge  2 and zero spin .",
    "all 4-band interactions contain the field @xmath184 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cp4b ] ) , and therefore vanish .",
    "the effect of the doping on the 2-band interactions is the same as when doping an isl , i.e. , in the bosonized version , the umklapp term ( [ eq : tb2 ] ) vanishes leaving only the term ( [ eq : tb1 ] ) , which opens a spin - gap , and leads to @xmath10-wave - like phase coherence between the bands @xmath21 and @xmath90 , corresponding to the fermi momenta @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the charge - gaps close to @xmath216 are the smallest ones ( note that @xmath217 ) , such that the hole - pairs enter first there .    in other words , it is the fact , that the ( @xmath218-wave ) afm processes @xmath219 ( partially ) coincide with the ( @xmath10-wave ) cooper processes with momentum transfer @xmath54 @xmath220 which makes a doped afm a superconductor : these particular afm / cooper processes flow at higher energies",
    " driven by afm processes  to strong coupling and are not suppressed at lower energies by doping ( see also fig .  [",
    "f : afp ] ) .",
    "we therefore have afm mediated superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the full phase - coherence around the fs then grows out of the phase - coherence between bands @xmath21 and @xmath90 , see below .    upon doping ,",
    "the afm correlations become _ _ in__commensurate . when doping away from half - filling , @xmath221 , and the afm peak shifts away from @xmath205 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : scf ] ) .",
    "in particular , for small @xmath222 , all bands are ( almost ) equally doped and @xmath223 , i.e. , the incommensurability is equal the doping @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , doping leads to a cutoff of the afm processes at the energy - scale of the chemical potential @xmath224 and therefore to an exponential decay of the spin - spin correlation function , where the coherence - length is given by @xmath225 .",
    "we argue , that for increasing doping , phase - coherence between the band pairs sets in , when the `` distance '' between neighboring bands is of the order of the `` distance '' of the fs to the umklapp surface , i.e. , for dopings @xmath226 .",
    "the system then becomes a 2d - like @xmath10-wave superconductor .",
    "since a finite chemical potential @xmath224 results in a low - energy cutoff for the umklapp and 4-band - afm interactions , one has to start initially with all interactions which are _ large _ at this cutoff energy - scale . in leading order , this implies that not only the 4-band interactions @xmath227 and @xmath228 have to be taken into account , but also `` neighbor '' processes of the form @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "these processes are only present down to an energy - scale @xmath231 . for dopings @xmath232 ,",
    "the `` neighbor '' processes are cutoff _ before _ the main afm processes , which leads to a decoupling into band pairs @xmath56 , while for @xmath233 all afm processes are cutoff by the chemical potential . in this case ,",
    "not only 2-band cooper interactions within band pairs @xmath56 are large at the cutoff energy - scale , but also the neighboring 2-band cooper interactions @xmath234 .    integrating the rges without afm and umklapp processes , but with initial - values for the cooper and forward interactions given by the afm phase , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratios2b ] ) , and similar initial - values for non - leading cooper processes @xmath235 ( @xmath236 ) , we obtain a @xmath237 superconducting instability at lower energies .",
    "we always find that the scaling of the couplings is exactly such that ( in particular , @xmath238 , @xmath239 ) @xmath240 where the pairing operator is @xmath241 and @xmath242 for @xmath243 respectively @xmath244 and @xmath245 in all other cases ( @xmath237 symmetry ) .",
    "the size ( but not the sign ) of @xmath246 depends on the initial - values ( i.e. , on the doping ) .",
    "note that the energy - scale of the system is reduced by doping , i.e. , the superconductor has a lower scale than the afm .    for large dopings ,",
    "the 4-band interactions are cutoff _ before _ they could have flown sufficiently close to the afm fixed - point , such that there is no instability in the rg flow and the low - energy phase is a fl  @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "for @xmath0 finite , there is between the insulating afm respectively isl phase at half - filling and the @xmath10-wave superconductor at higher doping , an intermediate , conducting phase with a spin - gap ( see also fig .",
    "[ f : sphd ] ) . in the 2d - limit",
    ", the intermediate phase seems to disappear .",
    "we have studied the dimensional crossover from 1d to 2d in half - filled , weakly interacting , @xmath0-leg hubbard ladders for @xmath49 . using the rg method",
    ", we found a crossover energy @xmath247 $ ] , where at energies below @xmath4 the behavior of the spin - sector is ladder - like and at energies above @xmath4 2d - afm - like .",
    "we showed that the 4-band - afm processes are responsible for an instability in the rg flow . since without 4-band and umklapp processes",
    "the hubbard ladders become a fl for large @xmath0  @xcite , afm processes ( at higher energies ) are necessary and sufficient for a nontrivial phase in the ( doped ) @xmath0-leg hubbard model .    in the afm phase , the couplings flow towards universal ratios and we obtained an analytical expression for the hamiltonian which is similar to the heisenberg afm . using bosonization techniques , we further investigated this hamiltonian and found that the charge - sector is the same as in the half - filled two - leg ladder , i.e. , the type of mott insulator is the same in 1d and 2d .",
    "for the spin - sector , bosonization techniques confirmed that the small-@xmath18 case has similar physical properties as the large-@xmath18 ( heisenberg ) case .",
    "the effects of doping on the half - filled hubbard hamiltonian and of reducing the number of coupled chains @xmath0 is ( almost ) the same : in both cases , the interactions between unpaired bands are suppressed , the antiferromagnetic correlations are reduced and only interactions within band pairs @xmath56 remain . doping then opens a spin - gap , but phase coherence exists only between bands @xmath21 and @xmath90 . at higher doping levels @xmath248 , we can expect that phase coherence between all bands sets in , such that the system becomes a 2d - like @xmath10-wave superconductor . while the lightly doped case is conveniently described by bound hole - pairs , the 2d - like superconductor at higher dopings",
    "is represented by a bcs - like @xmath10-wave hamiltonian with electron pairing . in the doped case",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations become incommensurate .    as a result",
    ", the hubbard model can not be understood in terms of an afm , isl or superconductor alone .",
    "the phase ( correlation function ) depends always on the energy - scale ( respectively length - scale ) and is related to the value of the llps .",
    "the afm exhibits the highest energy - scale . at half - filling ,",
    "the groundstate ( for @xmath0 finite ) is the isl and for sufficient doping the @xmath10-wave superconductor .",
    "we conjecture that in the doped case , the flow of the couplings from the afm to the @xmath10-wave takes place via an _ intermediate _ phase : consult table  ii ; afm and superconductor differ in _ two _ llps .",
    "this intermediate ( finite energy ) phase has then the same llps as the isl  suggesting that the spin - gap opens _ before _",
