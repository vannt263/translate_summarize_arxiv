    "the clustering of galaxies in the universe is characterized by their spatial positions , and their peculiar velocities which lead to deviations of their motion from the pure hubble flow .",
    "the big redshift surveys assembled in recent years by the diligent work of many astronomers give angular positions and redshifts for large numbers of galaxies .",
    "a rough 3d map can be obtained by placing the galaxies at distances along the line of sight derived via hubble s law from their redshifts .",
    "the peculiar velocity , however , also contributes to the redshift , and this leads to a misplacement of the galaxy away from its true location .",
    "the local gravitational field is the cause of the peculiar motion . and",
    "thus the redshift distortion in the galaxy maps can give information on the underlying matter distribution .",
    "the amplitude of the distortions can be estimated from the pair distribution of galaxies . for pairs of galaxies at distances",
    "much larger than their separation , one can use a plane - parallel approximation , and write for the power spectrum in redshift space , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the cosine of the angle between the wave vector and the line of sight .",
    "the linear redshift distortion parameter @xmath5 is related to the linear growth factor @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the matter density ) , and the bias @xmath8 of the density fluctuation spectrum via @xmath9 .",
    "p(k ) is the power spectrum in real space .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion ( pvd ) @xmath10 describes the virial motion of galaxies in dense systems , i.e. the finger - of - god effect . as shown by jing & brner ( 2001 ) , the redshift power spectrum of dark matter and its biased tracers",
    "can be accurately described by eq.([fitting ] ) . applying this model to an observation of @xmath11",
    "may therefore yield a determination of the three quantities @xmath12 , @xmath5 , and @xmath13 , all of which are useful observables for testing galaxy formation models    here we use the final release of the 2dfgrs ( ` http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs ` ) to measure @xmath14 and the pvd @xmath10 of galaxies .",
    "since we are interested in the pvd at small scale , we fix @xmath5 at a reasonable value of @xmath15 ( peacock et al .",
    "the 2df catalog has already been analyzed statistically with respect to the pvd ( hawkins et al 2003 ) , but here we use a novel method to estimate the pvd .",
    "furthermore , we take advantage of the large number of galaxies in the 2df catalog to bin the galaxies in different luminosity intervals , and to make the first study of the luminosity dependence of the pvd .",
    "this was not possible up to now , and we shall see that remarkable tests of the galaxy formation models become possible with the luminosity dependence of the pvd . the luminosity dependence of the clustering ( the two - point correlation function ) of galaxies in the 2dfgrs has been investigated ( norberg et al .",
    "2002a ) , but not of the pvd .",
    "in order to study the luminosity dependence of the pvd , we divide the galaxies into 11 subsamples according to their absolute luminosity .",
    "the subsamples are successively brightened by 0.5 magnitude from the faintest sample @xmath16 to @xmath17 , with successive subsamples overlapping by 0.5 magnitude . here",
    "@xmath18 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath19 . for computing the absolute magnitude ,",
    "we have used the k - correction and luminosity evolution model of norberg ( 2002b ; @xmath20 model ) ; , i.e. , the absolute magnitude is in the rest frame @xmath21 band at @xmath22 . we assume a cosmological model with the density parameter @xmath23 and the cosmological constant @xmath24 throughout this paper .",
    "we measure the redshift two - point correlation functions @xmath25 following the method of jing , mo , & brner(1998 ) .",
    "the random samples for the clustering analysis are generated in the same way as described in jing & brner ( 2004a ) .",
    "each random sample for a northern or southern luminosity subsample contains 100,000 random points .",
    "we convert the @xmath26 to @xmath27 by the fourier transformation .",
    "more details about our statistical method can be found in our journal paper ( jing & brner 2004b ) .",
    "in fig.1 the basic measurement of the power spectrum in redshift space @xmath28 is shown .",
    "the four panels in this figure correspond to four different luminosity intervals from faint to bright galaxies .",
    "the values of k range from @xmath29 at the top to @xmath30 at the bottom with an interval @xmath31 . the south and north samples agree quite well with the full survey indicating that cosmic variance is not a major problem .",
    "the power spectrum for the larger k - values decreases quite strongly with @xmath4 , more than a factor of @xmath32 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the solid lines are the best fits obtained by applying equation ( [ fitting ] ) to the data of the whole survey , showing that the model ( [ fitting ] ) can accurately describe the observed redshift power spectrum of galaxies .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the pvd is shown most clearly in fig.2 , where we have plotted @xmath35 at @xmath36 for the 11 overlapping samples .",
    "the surprising result is a strong dependence on luminosity with the bright and the faint galaxies reaching high values of @xmath37 or more , and a well defined minimum of @xmath38 for the galaxies of magnitude @xmath39 .",
    "the bright and the faint galaxies apparently have high random motions , as expected for objects in massive halos or in clusters .",
    "the @xmath1 like galaxies are rather moderate in their pvd , and probably reside in galaxy size halos .",
    "the thick solid line represents the prediction based on the up - to - date halo model of yang et al .",
    "for the halo model , we adopt the cosmological model that is a currently popular flat low - density model with the density parameter @xmath23 and the cosmological constant @xmath24 ( lcdm ) .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath40 and the amplitude @xmath41 of the linear density power spectrum are 0.2 and 0.9 respectively .",
    "we use two sets of simulations , with boxsizes @xmath42 and @xmath43 , that were generated with our vectorized - parallel @xmath44 code ( jing & suto 2002 ) for this model .",
    "both simulations use @xmath45 particles , so the particle mass @xmath46 is @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively in these two cases .",
    "we populate the halos with galaxies in a similar way to that of yang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but we used our own code and adopted the model parameters of model m1 in yang et al .",
    "the halo model , which matched nicely the luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of clustering of galaxies in 2dfgrs ( confirmed by our analysis ) , clearly does not match our observation of the pvd .",
    "the failure of the halo model indicates that the prescription of how to populate halos must be adapted better .",
    "the analysis of the velocity fields of the galaxies in the 2dfgrs has led to a surprising discovery : the random velocities of the faint galaxies are very high , around @xmath0 , reaching similar values as the bright galaxies . at intermediate luminosities",
    "the velocities exhibit a well defined steep minimum near @xmath2 .",
    "it seems that the galaxies in different luminosity intervals appear as different populations in their own right , defined by objective statistics .",
    "a look at figure 2 shows convincingly that this is actually the case . for this figure",
    "we have sorted the galaxies in 11 luminosity bins , each one magnitude wide , from magnitude @xmath49 to @xmath50 and plotted the value of @xmath51 at a wave number of @xmath52 .",
    "such a finely resolved binning of galaxies in samples of different luminosities is possible for the 2dfgrs , because it is big enough to contain sufficiently many galaxies in each luminosity class .",
    "the pvd is an indicator of the depth of the local gravitational potential .",
    "therefore we find the interesting result that the bright and the faint galaxies move in the strongest gravitational field .",
    "they are in clusters , while the galaxies around magnitude @xmath53 , the @xmath54 galaxies in the schechter luminosity function , populate the field .",
    "the bimodal nature of the correlation between the pvd and luminosity may be used as a stringent test of galaxy formation models .",
    "we have investigated the halo occupation model ( yang et al .",
    "2003 ) which has been optimally fitted to reproduce the luminosity function , and the two - point correlation function of the 2dfgrs .",
    "if we adapt this model to the pvd value of the @xmath54 galaxies , we see that it can not give the high values found for the fainter galaxies .",
    "the pvd values of the model actually run opposite to the data and the model assigns smaller values to the fainter galaxies .",
    "this must mean that the assignment of galaxies to the dark matter halos must be done in a more intricate way as up to now .",
    "the number of faint galaxies in clusters must be increased substantially to at least recover the high pvd found for them .",
    "also , the low value of @xmath55 found for the galaxies with magnitude @xmath56 must mean that these galaxies reside in dark matter halos of galactic size , the halo population model must be fitted with a much more complex scheme of assigning galaxies to halos , if the results shown in figure 2 are to be reproduced ,    another way , widely used , to connect dark matter to galaxies is the semianalytic modeling , where the dark matter distributions obtained from n - body simulations are supplemented with some of the physical processes important in galaxy formation using semianalytic techniques . a test of the pvd vs luminosity for this type of models will be the aim of a subsequent paper .",
