    "molecular thin films consisting of metal phthalocyanines are well known due to their particular electronic properties , which are both of fundamental as well as of applied relevance.@xcite they , for instance , are successfully used in organic electronic or optoelectronic devices . in their pristine form ,",
    "metal phthalocyanines are semiconductors . moreover , due to their relatively open crystal structure their properties can be tuned by the incorporation of electron acceptors and donors , and , for example , electrical conduction can be induced by the incorporation of alkali metals.@xcite in addition , the incorporation of transition metal ions in the center of a phthalocyanine ring results in the formation of small , well defined molecules with a particular magnetic moment .",
    "thus , transition metal phthalocyanines can be regarded as simple model compounds for the investigation of the fundamental electronic , and magnetic properties of many other transition metal containing molecules , among them molecular magnetic complexes or molecular magnets.@xcite    manganese phthalocyanine ( mnpc ) is one of these interesting and fundamental compounds.@xcite for instance , mnpc is characterized by an unusual s = 3/2 spin state of the mn@xmath4 ion @xcite , and mnpc has been referred to as a typical example of a molecular magnet.@xcite also , in mnpc the mn center has a formal 3@xmath5 electronic configuration , and the mn 3@xmath6 orbitals are expected to lie close to the chemical potential.@xcite recently , we demonstrated that the occupied electronic structure as well as the electronic excitation spectrum of mnpc is clearly different from all other transition metal phthalocyanines , which most likely is a direct consequence of the mn 3@xmath6 orbitals.@xcite in this context , it is also interesting to investigate the changes that are induced in mnpc by doping with e.g. alkali metals .",
    "the physical properties of such doped molecular materials are closely related to the fact whether particular doped phases exist .",
    "the detailed microscopic understanding of the physical behavior of the material in question requires the knowledge of the underlying structure and stoichiometry .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that upon potassium doping of znpc , cupc , and fepc two phases with k@xmath1mpc and k@xmath2mpc ( m = zn , cu , fe ) stoichiometries are formed.@xcite this parallels the situation as it was found for other potassium doped molecular materials , e.g. alkali metal doped fullerenes.@xcite in addition , potassium doping of copc leads to a change of the co spin and charge in the center of the molecule since the first electron transferred to a copc molecule will occupy a co 3@xmath6 orbital @xcite , i.e. charge transfer also might be used to access the magnetic degrees of freedom of such molecules .    in this contribution",
    ", we report on an investigation of the electronic properties of potassium doped mnpc films using electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in transmission .",
    "we discuss the changes that are induced in the electronic excitation spectrum as a function of doping , and we provide evidence for the formation of three doped phases with k@xmath0mnpc , k@xmath1mnpc , and k@xmath2mnpc composition .",
    "moreover , our data also indicate filling of a metal 3@xmath6 orbital upon doping , which then must be accompanied by a change of the magnetic moment of the mnpc molecule in the charged state .",
    "for our investigations , thin free - standing films of mnpc were prepared under ultra high vacuum conditions ( uhv ) by thermal evaporation onto a kbr ( 100 ) substrate kept at room temperature .",
    "the deposition rate was about @xmath7{nm / min}$ ] as measured using a quartz microbalance , and the resulting film thickness was about 100 nm . subsequently , the films were floated off in distilled water , mounted onto standard electron microscopy grids , and transferred into a purpose built spectrometer for eels @xcite , where _ in situ _ also the doping procedure was carried out . prior to doping ,",
    "the mnpc films were characterized using electron diffraction which showed that the films are essentially polycrystalline but well textured and mainly consist of the so called @xmath8-polymorph.@xcite potassium was added from a commercial saes source ( saes getters s.p.a . , italy ) .",
    "the doping took place at room temperature and under uhv conditions in several steps by evaporation of potassium from the getter source at a current of @xmath9{a}$ ] and a source - sample distance of about @xmath10{mm}$ ] .",
    "we note that this small distance might induce slight heating of the sample during potassium doping .",
    "all eels measurements were carried out in transmission and at room temperature using a dedicated @xmath11{kev}$ ] spectrometer described elsewhere.@xcite we note that at this high primary beam energy only singlet excitations are possible .",
    "eels measures the so called loss function , i m @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dielectric function .",
    "it thus contains information on the dielectric response of the material under investigation and it can also probe the excitations as a function of momentum transfer * q * even far away from the optical limit.@xcite the loss function of our samples was measured for a momentum transfer of * * q**=@xmath14{\\mathring{a}^{-1}}$ ] , parallel to the film surface . in order to obtain a direction independent core level excitation information ,",
    "we have determined the core level data for three different momentum directions such that the sum of these spectra represent a polycrystalline average also for the textured samples.@xcite the energy and momentum resolutions were @xmath15{mev}$ ] and @xmath16{\\mathring{a}^{-1}}$ ] for the loss function and diffraction measurements and @xmath17{mev}$ ] and @xmath16{\\mathring{a}^{-1}}$ ] in the case of the measured core level excitations .",
    "furthermore , as molecular crystals often are damaged by fast electrons , we repeatedly checked our samples for any sign of degradation and did not consider those with changes in electronic or diffraction spectra .",
    "for further details of the sample preparation and the experimental technique we refer the reader to previous publications.@xcite",
    "we start the presentation of our results with the evolution of the electronic excitation spectra of mnpc upon potassium doping , which is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "these data were taken with a momentum transfer of 0.1 @xmath18 and we note that for such a small momentum transfer eels probes dipole allowed excitations and the data are thus equivalent to those from optical studies.@xcite the loss function of pristine mnpc ( bottom curve in fig.[fig1 ] ) consists of several excitation features at 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.4 , 1.8 , 2.1 , and 2.8ev , which were already reported earlier.@xcite the electronic excitation features at 1.8 - 2ev are associated with the well known q band common to many phthalocyanines.@xcite this q band in the solid state is broad and structured because of vibronic satellites and the impact of solid state effects.@xcite it has its origin in excitations from the occupied molecular orbital with a@xmath19 symmetry to an unoccupied molecular orbital with e@xmath20 symmetry.@xcite the exact origin of the excitations at lower energies is unclear to date .",
    "they have been discussed in terms of the contribution of mn 3@xmath6 states to the molecular orbitals close to the chemical potential in mnpc @xcite but there is no full , consistent understanding of what can be observed in fig.[fig1 ] for pristine mnpc .",
    "upon potassium addition we observe significant changes in the excitation spectra .",
    "first , the two features a1 and a2 and the q - band excitation ( d ) disappear while new spectral structures show up at 1.5ev ( c ) and about 2.6ev ( e ) .",
    "further doping leads to an energetic down - shift of feature e and the appearance of a further excitation at about 1.1ev ( b ) .",
    "the intensity of feature b reaches a maximum at intermediate doping and then decreases in intensity , while feature c grows slightly and feature e continues to shift to lower energies .",
    "the data in fig.[fig1 ] indicate the existence of distinct k - mnpc compositions ( stages 1 , 2 and 3 ) with particular stoichiometry and optical properties .",
    "stage 1 is reached when the low energy structures a1 and a2 have vanished and features c and e have developed at 1.5 and 2.6ev , respectively .",
    "the addition of more potassium induces the formation of stage 2 , which is signalled by the appearance of feature b and the downshift of feature e. finally , in stage 3 feature b disappears again , feature c increases in intensity and feature e reaches its final energy position at about 2.1ev . in general , the formation of distinct potassium doped mnpc phases parallels the situation in other transition phthalocyanines upon addition of potassium , where it was reported that phases with compositions k@xmath1znpc ,",
    "k@xmath2znpc , k@xmath1cupc , k@xmath2cupc , k@xmath1fepc , and k@xmath2fepc exist.@xcite however , we emphasize that the data in fig.[fig1 ] indicate three potassium doped mnpc structures , one more than for the other phthalocyanines .",
    "our conclusion that stages 1 , 2 and 3 as described above correspond to stable , potassium doped phases of mnpc requires that the spectra in - between can be described by a superposition of the spectra of the corresponding phases in the direct neighborhood , in analogy to what was observed for k doped cupc . in fig.[fig2 ] we show a comparison of corresponding data for potassium contents between undoped mnpc and stage 1 as well as stage 2 and 3 , respectively , with modelled data obtained by a weighted sum of the data for the respective phases .",
    "the agreement of measured and modelled data is very good , which corroborates our conclusion that these phases are formed .",
    "moreover , evidence that stable phases are formed can also be read off the evolution of the electron diffraction profiles of our samples . in fig.[fig3 ] , we show the doping induced changes around 1.1@xmath18 and 0.5@xmath18 .",
    "the diffraction maximum at 1.12@xmath18 ( left panel of fig.[fig3 ] ) in the undoped mnpc samples is due to the ( 201 ) bragg peak of the @xmath8-polymorph of mnpc @xcite , and it vanishes upon potassium addition . reaching doping stage 1 , a new diffraction peak at 1.15 @xmath18 is observed , which is further shifted going to the doped stages 2 and 3 .",
    "the diffraction peak at 0.5@xmath18 in pristine mnpc ( right panel of fig.[fig3 ] ) corresponds to the ( 100 ) bragg peak and shifts to lower values upon doping . for stage 1",
    "it is found at about 0.48@xmath18 , while for the two other stages it is at about 0.47@xmath18 .",
    "mnpc phases with @xmath21 .",
    "the bars indicate the excitation energies as seen in optical absorption for electrochemically reduced mnpc@xmath22 , mnpc@xmath23 , and mnpc@xmath24 molecules in solution.@xcite , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    further support for our conclusion , that stages 1 , 2 , and 3 are formed , can be obtained by a comparison of our data to the optical absorption taken for electrochemically charged mnpc molecules in solution.@xcite this is depicted in fig.[fig4 ] , which summarizes the excitation spectra obtained for the undoped mnpc and the three potassium doped stages and compares those to the excitation energies obtained for the mnpc@xmath22 monoion , mnpc@xmath23 diion and mnpc@xmath24 tetraion in solution.@xcite in consideration of the broadening upon going from single molecules in solution to the solid state , and a possible different excitation energy due to different screening effects , the data presented in fig.[fig4 ] indicate the same trend for potassium doping in the solid and negative charging in solution .",
    "we therefore assign our doped phases to k@xmath0mnpc ( stage 1 ) , k@xmath1mnpc ( stage 2 ) and k@xmath2mnpc ( stage 3 ) .",
    "finally , the amount of potassium in the samples can be determined by eels core level excitation measurements at the c 1@xmath25 and k 2@xmath26 core levels . in fig.[fig5 ] we show these core excitations for undoped mnpc and the three identified doped phases . in general ,",
    "the data in fig.[fig5 ] arise from excitations of carbon 1@xmath25 electrons into unoccupied @xmath27 states at 285 - 291ev , those from the c 1@xmath25 level into carbon derived @xmath28 states with the so - called @xmath29 edge at 291 - 292ev , and k 2@xmath26 to k 3@xmath6 excitations with maxima at 297.1 and 298.8ev.@xcite the data are normalized to the intensity of the first c 1@xmath25 @xmath28 feature at about 293ev which represents the amount of carbon in the sample .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] clearly shows the increasing potassium content in our samples .",
    "an analysis of the intensities of the k 2@xmath26 excitation structures in comparison to well characterized potassium doped fullerenes or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) yields a doping level k@xmath30mnpc of @xmath31 and 4 for our samples .",
    "details of this procedure can be found in previous publications.@xcite we estimate the error of this analysis to be @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 ( k@xmath30mnpc ) .",
    "thus , this core level analysis corroborates our assignment of the identified potassium doped mnpc phases to k@xmath0mnpc , k@xmath1mnpc and k@xmath35mnpc , respectively .     and",
    "k2 @xmath26 core level excitations of pristine mnpc and the potassium doped mnpc phases.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    consequently , in analogy to other transition metal phthalocyanines also k doping of mnpc results in particular doped phases , but mnpc is the only phthalocyanine reported so far that also forms a k@xmath0mnpc phase .",
    "this difference might be closely related to the occupancy and energy position of the 3@xmath6 levels of the central transition metal . in the case of mnpc ,",
    "data from photoemission spectroscopy , eels and theory clearly indicate the presence of mn @xmath3 orbitals very close to the chemical potential , and actually at energies in - between the fully occupied @xmath36 and the lowest unoccupied @xmath37 ligand molecular orbitals.@xcite furthermore , these mn 3@xmath6 orbitals are also responsible for a significant change of the ionization potential and most likely also the electron affinity .",
    "previous electrochemistry investigations have provided evidence that the first oxidation as well as the first reduction state of mnpc molecules have strong mn 3@xmath6 character.@xcite we therefore infer that the first electron that is transferred by potassium addition to each mnpc molecule in the solid state will occupy a state with predominant mn 3@xmath6 character , which is in agreement with the disappearance of the low energy electronic excitations as seen in undoped mnpc and which might help to stabilize a phase with corresponding stoichiometry , k@xmath0mnpc .",
    "it is interesting to note , that also in potassium doped copc films the first electron occupies a metal ( co ) 3@xmath6 state before the ligand orbitals are filled.@xcite further electron transfer caused by further potassium addition then leads to the occupation of the ligand @xmath38 orbitals with electrons and the formation of the other observed phases .",
    "the fact that for all transition metal phthalocyanines investigated so far the maximal potassium doping is @xmath39 = 4 is most likely a consequence of steric or geometrical reasons .",
    "finally , the observed filling of a mn 3@xmath6 orbital upon potassium addition demonstrates the formation of mn(i ) centers , which is directly accompanied by a change of the magnetic moment .",
    "this now evinces a way to deliberately change the magnetic properties of such molecules via charge transfer in thin films .",
    "it additionally might have consequences for the charge transport behavior of mnpc films , since electrons injected into a film might occupy metal 3@xmath6 rather than ligand @xmath40 orbitals with rather different wave function and hopping probabilities .",
    "the associated variation of the spin state of mnpc can also affect the spin scattering mechanisms in spin - dependent transport .",
    "to summarize , we studied the electronic properties of undoped and potassium doped manganese phthalocyanines using electron energy - loss spectroscopy .",
    "our data allow the identification of three doped phases , k@xmath0mnpc , k@xmath1mnpc , and k@xmath35mnpc and show the variations in the electronic excitation spectra upon doping .",
    "in addition , in k@xmath0mnpc a mnpc orbital with predominant 3@xmath6 character is filled , i.e. doping can change the valence and spin state of the mn center .",
