    "recent measurements of the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera enable to study the proton structure in the region of low @xmath1 where perturbative qcd has to face computation difficulties arising from the increase of the strong coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a number of approaches to describe the transition to low @xmath3 at small @xmath0 together with the region , , which is described by perturbative qcd very well .",
    "such attempts involve reggeon exchange ideas @xcite , dipole interactions @xcite , vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite , efficient parametrisations @xcite and others .",
    "this letter presents a different point of view , based on the idea that the proton structure at low @xmath0 is of fractal nature . using the fractal dimension concept @xcite , a simple parametrisation of the proton structure function @xmath4is obtained with a few well defined parameters . a numeric study is made using recent small @xmath0 hera data , for @xmath3 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the concept of fractal dimension requires to understand what is meant by _",
    "dimension_. in non - fractional dimensions a number of dimensions corresponds to a number of independent directions in a corresponding coordinate system .",
    "for example , a line has obviously one dimension , a square two and a cube has three dimensions .",
    "the dimension of the sierpinski gasket @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ gasket ] , needs a more general definition .    the cube , square and line are _ self - similar _ objects : when a line is broken in the middle two lines are obtained , each of half length .",
    "by magnifying one of them by a factor of two the original line is rebuilt . the same may be done by dividing a square into four small squares or a cube into smaller cubes .",
    "for example , when the magnification factor for a square is 3 the number of smaller squares will be @xmath7 , for a cube the same magnification gives @xmath8 cubes . in general ,",
    "when @xmath9 is the magnification factor , then the number of objects will be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dimension of the object .",
    "the dimension @xmath11 can thus be defined as    @xmath12    according to this formula , the dimension of the sierpinski gasket is fractional .",
    "when the magnification factor @xmath9 is 2 there are 3 identical pieces of the gasket , for @xmath13 the gasket consists of 9 small copies of itself",
    ". therefore its fractal dimension is defined by    @xmath14    roughly speaking , the fractal dimension describes how complicated or how large a self - similar object is .",
    "a plane is ` larger ' than a line .",
    "the sierpinski gasket is not a line but also far from being a plane .",
    "actually , there exist fractals which are constructed from lines but have dimensions 2 or 3 , and therefore fill a plane or a space .",
    "an example of such a curve is the so called hilbert curve .",
    "the definition of a dimension , given in equation ( [ dimdef1 ] ) , may be generalised for the case of non - discrete fractals . in this generalisation ,",
    "the magnification ( scaling ) factor is a real number @xmath15 and the number of self - similar objects is represented by a density function @xmath16 .",
    "taking into account that the dimension may change with scaling , a _ local dimension _ is defined as    @xmath17    for ideal mathematical fractals , discussed so far , @xmath18 is constant for the whole fractal . introducing a scale",
    "dependent dimension is natural because many fractals in nature ( e.g. plants or coastlines ) are not mathematically ideal and usually have a fractal structure only for a certain region of magnification . in such a region ,",
    "the dimension is approximately constant , @xmath19 , and , following eq .",
    "( [ dimdef2 ] ) , the density function @xmath16 is given as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 defines the normalisation of @xmath16 , which thus has a _ power law _",
    "behaviour ,    in general , fractals may have two _ independent _ magnification factors , @xmath15 and @xmath22 . in this case the density @xmath23 is written in the following way    @xmath24    here the dimension @xmath25 represents the dimensional correlation relating the @xmath15 and @xmath22 factors .",
    "the function @xmath23 satisfies a power law behaviour in @xmath15 for fixed @xmath22 and in @xmath22 for fixed @xmath15 .",
    "it is important to mention that there is certain freedom in selecting magnification factors without changing a shape of the function @xmath23 .",
    "it is possible to use any non - zero power of a factor multiplied by a constant : @xmath26 .",
    "the only effect of such a change is a redefinition of the dimensional parameters @xmath27 and of the normalisation @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "following the dimensional description of the presented fractal structures , it is interesting to study the properties of functions describing proton structure . in quantum chromodynamics",
    "the behaviour of the sea quark densities is driven by gluon emissions and splittings .",
    "the deeper the proton structure is probed , the more gluon - gluon interactions can be observed .",
    "these , in analogy to fractals , may follow self - similarity , i.e. scaling described by a power law .",
    "indeed , there is a number of hints for a self - similar structure . as an example , figure [ udens ] shows the unintegrated u - quark density for fixed momentum transfer @xmath3 and fixed bjorken @xmath0 , respectively .    for @xmath28 ( below the valence quark region )",
    "the unintegrated density function in log - log scale is linear .",
    "a linear behaviour is also exhibitted by the unintegrated density as a function of @xmath3 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "refering to eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) , this suggests that @xmath0 and @xmath3 could be treated as appropriate magnification ( scaling ) factors .",
    "this is supporting the idea that the proton structure exhibits self - similar properties and may be described as a fractal object .",
    "magnification factors are supposed to fulfil some criteria .",
    "they should be positive , non - zero and have no physical dimension .",
    "the two latter requirements concern the selection of @xmath3 as a magnification factor .",
    "the physical dimensionality may be removed by dividing @xmath3 by a constant @xmath29 . for the case of @xmath30 ,",
    "the non - zero requirement is not fulfilled , however , the access to this region is needed for integration of unintegrated densities .",
    "thus instead of @xmath3 a choice of @xmath31 as a magnification factor is appropriate . according to the freedom in the magnification factor selection , mentioned above",
    ", other equivalent choices are also possible , e.g. @xmath32 , @xmath33 or similar combinations .",
    "it is also more appropriate to use @xmath34 as a magnification factor rather than @xmath0 itself : when the structure is probed deeper , @xmath0 goes to zero while a magnification factor should rise .",
    "the concept of self - similarity , when applied to proton confinement structure , leads to a simple parametrisation of quark densities within the proton in a straightforward way based on eq .",
    "( [ twod ] ) . using magnification factors @xmath34 and @xmath31 ,",
    "an unintegrated quark density may be written in the following general form    @xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes a quark flavour .",
    "conventional , integrated quark densities @xmath37 are defined as a sum over all contributions with quark virtualities smaller than that of the photon probe , @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath38 has to be integrated over @xmath3 ,    @xmath39    solving equation ( [ param2 ] ) , the following analytical parametrisation of a quark density is obtained @xmath40    notice that in this parametrisation only the normalisation parameter @xmath41 depends on the quark flavour while the other parameters are flavour independent .",
    "this assumption means that all quarks are following the fractal structure , i.e. the dimensions @xmath42 and the magnification factors are common for all of them and they differ in normalisation only .",
    "the proton structure function @xmath4is related directly to the quark densities @xmath43 .",
    "thus the assumption about the flavour symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ param3 ] ) allows to express @xmath4directly in the form given on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ param3 ] ) with @xmath44 replaced by @xmath45 and with a common normalisation factor @xmath46 :    @xmath47",
    "the five parameters @xmath48 and @xmath29 are determined using recent data from the hera experiments h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite in the range @xmath49 ( h1 ) and @xmath50 ( zeus ) .",
    "additionally a cut @xmath51 has been applied to exclude the valence quark region .",
    "the fit parameters are given in table [ parameters ] and the corresponding description of the @xmath4data is shown in figures [ fith1zeus ] , [ fith1 ] and [ fitzeus ] .",
    "the @xmath52 was calculated with total errors , adding the statistical and systematical errors in quadrature . when the relative normalisation of the h1 and zeus data , which cover different @xmath3 regions , was fitted no change beyond 1% was imposed by the fits .",
    "thus the normalisations of the data sets were left untouched .",
    ".results of the fit .",
    "the first row corresponds to a fit to all parameters , in the second row parameter @xmath53 was fixed to @xmath54 .",
    "the number of @xmath55 data points is 172 , total errors were used for the @xmath52 calculation . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     refering to figure [ fith1zeus ] the ratio @xmath56 is proportional to the virtual photon - proton cross - section @xmath57 . in the limit @xmath58 and fixed @xmath59 the parametrisation ( [ paramf2 ] ) behaves like @xmath3 only for @xmath60",
    "this may be easily shown e.g. when the unintegrated structure function @xmath61 is introduced    @xmath62    the parametrisation of which is identical to ( [ param1 ] ) , with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath63 and @xmath64 replaced by @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath4 behaves like @xmath3 for then @xmath61 has to behave like a constant for any . that is possible only if the divergent term , involving @xmath53 , is zero , i.e. for . in this case , since other logarithmic terms go to zero , the ratio @xmath56 for @xmath58 approaches the value @xmath46 .    in the fit with @xmath53 as a free parameter",
    "a value very close to @xmath54 is obtained .",
    "thus a second fit was made , where @xmath53 is fixed to @xmath54 ( see table [ parameters ] , second row ) .",
    "this fit has 4 parameters and gives nearly the same @xmath65 as the first fit to all 5 parameters . within the kinematic range of the @xmath55 data ,",
    "both fits are nearly indistinguishable . as was stated above , the parameter @xmath21 determines the virtual photon - proton cross - section in the photoproduction limit .",

    "the concept of the self - similar structure of the proton was introduced .",
    "this leads to a parametrisation of the proton structure function @xmath4which describes very well the low @xmath0 hera data , both in the non - perturbative and the deep inelastic domain .",
    "the introduced formalism uniquely defines the @xmath0 and @xmath3 dependence of parton densities , thus this approach is applicable also to other measures of proton structure , like the longitudinal structure function @xmath67 , the diffractive structure function @xmath68 or the spin structure function @xmath69 ."
