    "recently there has been interest expressed in having relatively low energy , high luminosity polarized electron beams for studies of parity - violating ( pv ) electron scattering @xcite .",
    "one such is the mesa accelerator at mainz @xcite ; another might be an upgraded version of the fel facility at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "various motivations underlie these initiatives including improved measurements of pv electron - proton scattering at low momentum transfers , of the neutron radii of nuclei and of tests of the standard model , both of the weak mixing angle and of higher order radiative corrections including single - nucleon box and cross - box two - boson exchange diagrams and dispersion corrections . here",
    "pv scattering from nuclei is involved and this raises the questions : how well can nuclear structure effects be taken into account ?",
    "what level of uncertainty exists in evaluating these nuclear effects , both at present or through future theoretical studies ?    in the present paper we report the results of a study of specific classes of nuclear effects to be discussed in the following section , and indicate in some cases where additional work might be undertaken .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : following these brief introductory comments , in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] the basic formalism is summarized .",
    "references are given in that section to much more detailed treatments of the formalism and so here only a few specifics needed for the present study are highlighted .",
    "the various effects that either stem from nuclear structure issues or involve strangeness content in the nucleons in the nucleus are enumerated at this point . following this in sec .",
    "[ results ] results are given for the case of @xmath0c , both for the assumed kinematics of the mesa facility and for somewhat higher energies that might become available with an upgraded jlab fel facility .",
    "included there is a careful analysis of the expected fractional uncertainties in the pv asymmetry expected with these , together with the uncertainties projected to arise from nuclear structure uncertainties and from our current knowledge of strangeness .",
    "the paper then concludes with a brief summary of our findings .",
    "the weak interaction contains vector and axial - vector components having opposite behavior under a parity transformation .",
    "this is at the origin of the non - zero value of the pv asymmetry in electron scattering , which is defined as the relative difference between the cross sections of incoming electrons longitudinally polarized parallel ( @xmath1 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath2 ) to their momentum : @xmath3 by considering the exchange of a single gauge boson for each of the two interactions involved in the process , namely the neutral weak ( @xmath4 boson ) and the electromagnetic ( photon ) interactions , and neglecting the effect of the nuclear coulomb field on the electron wave functions , _",
    "i.e. _ within plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) , the pv asymmetry can be written as @xcite @xmath5 it is apparent that the pv asymmetry factorizes into a standard - model part , containing the fermi ( weak ) and the fine - structure ( electromagnetic ) coupling constants , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , a four - momentum transfer dependence @xmath8 , and a nuclear - structure dependent part containing the ratio of the pv to the parity - conserving ( pc ) responses .",
    "the former arises from an electromagnetic - weak interaction interference ( indicated with a hat in the hadronic tensors below ) and contains terms with vector - vector tensors weighted by the weak neutral axial coupling of the electron @xmath9 , both longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) and transverse ( @xmath11 ) , as well as a term ( @xmath12 ) with axial - vector tensors weighted by the weak neutral vector coupling of the electron @xmath13 : @xmath14 the pc response , on the other hand , is purely electromagnetic and therefore contains just vector - vector tensors , both longitudinal and transverse : @xmath15    when considering an @xmath16 nuclear target with pure isospin @xmath17 in its ground state , only the isoscalar part of the elastic responses is involved , which effectively removes the axial - vector contribution ( @xmath18 ) from the pv response , since the isoscalar axial coupling of the weak neutral interaction ( @xmath19 ) is zero in the standard model ( at tree level ) .",
    "if we further restrict ourselves to elastic scattering by @xmath20 nuclear targets , only the coulomb - type monopole ( @xmath21 ) multipole operators contribute to the responses , so that the transverse terms ( t ) both in the pv and the pc responses do not contribute either .",
    "in this situation both responses become trivially proportional @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vector isoscalar weak neutral coupling of the nucleon and @xmath9 , as stated above , is the electron weak neutral axial coupling ; both can be expressed at tree level in terms of the electromagnetic - weak ( weinberg ) mixing angle @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 0.23 . the pv asymmetry with the above - mentioned conditions",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath28 a_a^e \\sin^2\\theta_w \\cong 3.22 \\cdot 10^{-6 } \\:|q^2|\\ ] ] when the momentum transfer is given in @xmath29 .",
    "the nuclear target under consideration in the present work , @xmath0c , has 0@xmath30 angular momentum and parity in its ground state , as well as nominal @xmath17 since @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , a precise measurement of the pv asymmetry allows a precise determination of the values of the standard model constants , in particular the mixing angle @xmath24 , if all of the above mentioned conditions are met , namely , one - boson exchange ( no box diagrams ) , no coulomb distortion of projectile wave functions , no dispersion effects to non-0@xmath30 excited states of @xmath0c , absence of strangeness in the nucleons and no isospin - mixing effects . our current experimental knowledge does not ensure the actual fulfillment of some of these conditions , such as the absence of strangeness in the nucleon @xcite , and clearly refutes others , such as the isospin purity of the nuclear state which is spoiled by the inescapable coulomb interaction among protons .",
    "therefore their consequences need to be modeled by theory and extracted from the measured pv asymmetry , introducing theoretical uncertainties in the analysis . under the term ` theoretical uncertainties '",
    "we include the variability in the theory describing a given feature , for instance different microscopic nuclear structure models , as well as the experimental uncertainty in the parameters of the models , for instance the strangeness content of the nucleon .    the planned experimental conditions @xcite , which will be used as starting point and reference case in this study , consist of 150 mev polarized electrons with a luminosity of @xmath31 particles per @xmath32 per s. scattered electrons are to be detected with scattering angles between 25@xmath33 and 45@xmath33 , typically for a total of 10@xmath34 seconds running time ( approximately 100 days )",
    ". an ideal degree of electron polarization of 100@xmath35 is assumed here .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the measured pv asymmetry and the model - dependent uncertainty of the corresponding theoretical prediction are to be kept below 0.3@xmath35 so that new information on electroweak couplings or on higher - order interaction effects can be extracted .",
    "in addition we explore other possible kinematic regions where theoretical uncertainties and the experimental figure - of - merit are such that the relative error of the asymmetry remains below 0.3@xmath35 , even when some of the experimental features such the luminosity or the running time are relaxed .",
    "we allow for the possibility of an integrated measurement of the pv asymmetry within a given solid angular range , thus reducing the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the analysis of different kinematic regions will be based on a set of energies of 150 mev , 300 mev and 500 mev , according to the capabilities of facilities like mesa at mainz or potentially the fel accelerator at jefferson laboratory .    in the processes under study here",
    "the incident energy @xmath36 of the electrons as well as the scattering angle @xmath37 at which they are detected are under control , both quantities determining the momentum transfer @xmath38 of the interaction . in the extreme relativistic limit and ignoring the nuclear recoil it is given by @xmath39 for an easier interpretation of kinematic conditions in terms of momentum transfer or of scattering angle for a fixed incident energy , we show their relationship in fig .",
    "[ q_theta ] for the incident energies used in this work .     and",
    "45@xmath33 are highlighted , as well as the corresponding momentum transfers in our reference case of @xmath40 150 mev for an easy translation of kinematic conditions among the different incident momenta .",
    "[ q_theta],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the various effects that will be explored in this work ( see below ) give rise to different pv asymmetries which are very hard to distinguish from each other when plotted directly as functions of a kinematic variable .",
    "therefore we plot instead asymmetry deviations for each effect , @xmath41 , defined as the difference between the theoretical pv asymmetry under study , @xmath42 ( with only effect @xmath43 on ) , and our reference value , @xmath44 , divided by the reference value .",
    "the total pv asymmetry contains all of the effects and can therefore be written as @xmath45 where the interference terms between different effects , of the type @xmath46 , are considered to be small and so are neglected in this analysis .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in any of the pv asymmetry deviations @xmath47 effectively translate into relative theoretical uncertainties of the corresponding pv asymmetries , since @xmath48 for instance , if different reasonable nuclear models yield a deviation range @xmath49 0.01 due to effect @xmath50 , the relative theoretical uncertainty of the pv asymmetry is 1@xmath35 ( with respect to @xmath44 ) .    several sources of theoretical uncertainties are explored in this work .",
    "first , the electromagnetic charge of the nuclear target is responsible for the coulomb distortion of the incoming and outgoing electron wave functions ; theoretical uncertainties in the distribution of this charge within the nucleus translate into pv asymmetry uncertainties through the effect of the coulomb distortion of the projectile wave function , which is computed within the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis is carried out using a three - parameter fermi distribution for the nuclear charge density : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the radius , diffuseness and central - depression parameters , respectively .",
    "different ground - state charge distributions are then generated by varying the values of these parameters from their fitted values @xcite , keeping the corresponding rms charge radius within the known experimental range @xcite . to avoid confusion with isospin - mixing effects ( see below ) ,",
    "the ground - state neutron distribution is taken to be the same as the charge distribution .",
    "we study next the effect of isospin mixing in the nuclear ground state due to the electromagnetic interaction , which reveals itself in the form of different proton and neutron distributions . in this case",
    "we model the nuclear ground state as an axially - deformed hartree - fock mean field employing skyrme nucleon - nucleon interactions , together with pairing via a bcs approximation @xcite .",
    "skyrme interactions are effective nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "they include a two - body force in the form of a short - range expansion which leads to momentum dependence ( @xmath55 ) , and contain the appropriate exchange terms of which only the spin exchange ( @xmath56 ) appears explicitly in the final skyrme expression .",
    "an additional term is added to account for two - body spin - orbit interaction .",
    "finally , an extra term introduces a three - body force in the form of a density - dependent ( @xmath57 ) term . a general skyrme interaction",

    "although a nucleus as light as @xmath0c might not be very well suited to such mean - field approaches , we estimate the theoretical variability of the nuclear isospin mixing by using a set of representative skyrme parametrizations in a hartree - fock calculation . a like - nucleon pairing interaction within the bcs approximation",
    "is also included , using a fixed pairing energy gap , equal for protons and neutrons , that can be modified to study its effect on the isospin mixing .",
    "another possible indirect source of isospin mixing , an axial deformation in the nuclear ground state , is considered by introducing quadrupole constraints in the skyrme hartree - fock energy functional .",
    "further analysis in the future will require , if available , state - of - the - art ab - initio many - body calculations of the nuclear target ground state . for example , an interesting study could be made using the green s function monte carlo approach @xcite ; the @xmath0c ground state could be obtained using a non - isospin - violating potential where the isospin would be @xmath17 as well as with the av18 potential which has charge symmetry breaking contributions . and",
    "in both cases the coulomb interaction could be added perturbatively .",
    "this would yield estimates of isospin mixing stemming both from the coulomb interaction as in our present study and also via the charge symmetry breaking terms in the potential . since the latter are obtained phenomenologically by fixing the potential to fit the systematics of nucleon - nucleon scattering , non - coulombic isospin - mixing effects would to some extent",

    "it should also be noted that the various interactions were obtained by emphasizing good agreement for specific properties ( binding energies , energy levels , the nature of the deformation , rms radii , be2s ) , but not necessarily all properties simultaneously , and it is not obvious what matters most for the analysis of the pv asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , as stated above , the interactions being used were not specifically designed for @xmath0c , and one sees reflections of this in the fact that some are better than others at reproducing the position of the diffraction minimum in the elastic cross section .",
    "similar conclusions could be expected from the whole set of near 250 different skyrme parametrizations that can be found in the literature and that work reasonably well in describing a given set of properties of finite nuclei or of nuclear matter .",
    "concerning the latter , a comprehensive analysis of the skyrme interactions has been performed in @xcite in relation to nuclear matter constraints to find that only a few of them pass the test .",

    "let us assume that the sum runs over @xmath63 , with @xmath64 denoting the ground state , first excited state , _ etc . _",
    "the total asymmetry is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the pv asymmetry for excitation of the @xmath67 state and @xmath68 being the ( parity - conserving ) cross section for a transition from the ground state to the @xmath67 excited state and one has @xmath69 .",
    "defining the deviation from the reference asymmetry as above one then has @xmath70 since the elastic scattering cross section , namely the contribution from the coulomb monopole charge form factor , is proportional to @xmath71 , whereas the inelastic cross sections are not coherent , one expects at least to have @xmath72 for @xmath73 and thus that @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , at low momentum transfers the inelastic multipole matrix elements are further suppressed by powers of @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a characteristic nuclear momentum transfer scale , roughly 1 @xmath29 .",
    "thus , even from such rough arguments one expects a minor contribution from inelastic transitions , unless the resolution is so poor that a very large range of energies must occur in the sums above .    in the specific case of @xmath0c , first assuming that the energy resolution is sufficient to involve only the @xmath17 excited states ( _ i.e. , _",
    "better than 15.11 mev ; here we do not consider isospin mixing in the excited states , although in a full analysis that can be taken into account ) , assuming no strangeness contributions and working at tree level in the standard model ( where the isoscalar axial - vector coupling is zero ) one has a very simple answer , namely @xmath77 , since all weak neutral current multipole matrix elements are proportional to the corresponding electromagnetic matrix elements with a universal coupling .",
    "thus any non - zero result must come from having strangeness or from taking into account beyond - tree - level contributions to the isoscalar axial - vector matrix elements .",
    "the former occurs because for inelastic contributions in general both @xmath78 and @xmath79 can occur , in contrast to the elastic scattering result where magnetic strangeness enters only as a very small relativistic spin - orbit contribution ( see the following discussion ) .",
    "the latter implies that the va interference response must be taken into account ; however , because of the smallness of the vector leptonic coupling and because this contribution is suppressed at the forward scattering angles being considered in this work , one expects a very small contribution here .",
    "the situation is even clearer if the experimental resolution is good enough to require one to take into account only the first two excited states of carbon , the @xmath80 state at 4.4389 mev and the @xmath81 state at 7.6542 mev @xcite .",
    "a transition to the latter has the same characteristics as the elastic case , namely with the same proportionality of the wnc and em matrix elements , and hence has the same asymmetry , @xmath82 .",
    "the former can be more complicated in that both c2 and e2 multipoles enter and the e2 has both convection and magnetization current contributions , convection involving @xmath78 and magnetization @xmath79 , while the c2 involves only @xmath78 .",

    "involved and taking into account strangeness content as discussed below , one finds that @xmath84 is below the 10@xmath85 level and hence inconsequential for the present discussions .",
    "regarding the possible effects of meson - exchange currents ( mec ) , we note that mec effects of non - strange type will cancel in a situation where there is no isospin mixing and no strangeness .",
    "if isospin mixing is present , but no strangeness , isoscalar and isovector matrix elements are modified in different ways , typically at the 10@xmath35 level or less at low momentum transfers @xcite , and so the results above may change by roughly this amount leading to uncertainties of typically a few parts in 1000 . finally , with isospin mixing and strangeness in the nucleons ( one - body strangeness ) the dominant effects are from the latter ; two - body strangeness effects at low @xmath38 should be very small according to previous studies @xcite .",

    "[ dev_strange ] , yielding an overall effect from 0.2 to 1@xmath35 in the region of interest .",
    "the spread arising from these three cases lies between 0.5 and 1.5@xmath35 .",
    "the most relevant contribution to these effects comes from the electric strangeness , since magnetic strangeness in the monopole matrix element arises only through a rather suppressed spin - orbit correction of relativistic origin @xcite .",
    "however , a larger effect of the magnetic strangeness may appear in inelastic transitions , as discussed above .     in the lower axis and of the scattering angle in the upper axes for three incident energies , 150 mev , 300 mev and 500 mev .",

    "he experiment is also shown ( thick grey line ) @xcite .",
    "[ dev_strange],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is clear from the previous discussion that current experimental uncertainty on the strangeness content of the nucleon is a critical source of uncertainty in the pv asymmetry . in order to reduce this uncertainty below the critical value , @xmath94 in our case",
    ", one should , according to fig .",
    "[ dev_strange ] , restrict the measurements to a kinematic region where the momentum transfer @xmath38 is lower than a given value @xmath95 , which corresponds to a given value of the scattering angle @xmath96 different for each incident energy @xmath36 . at the same time the kinematic region of measurement should provide a large enough number of events so that the statistical error lies below the critical value , @xmath97 .",
    "the latter is clearly the experimental contribution to the asymmetry uncertainty , whereas the former , @xmath98 , is the theoretical contribution ; systematic errors are not dealt with in this study .",

    "the @xmath62 dependence of the strangeness contribution suggests focusing on a momentum transfer region between 1 and 1.5 @xmath29 where , as can be seen in fig .",

    "[ energies_solidangle_vs_q ] . assuming a small contribution from any other effect , a precise measurement of the pv asymmetry in this region would reduce the strangeness content uncertainty , which is then translatable to any other kinematic region , in particular to low @xmath38 , according to eqs . ( [ strange_elec_ff ] ) and ( [ strange_magn_ff ] ) .",
    "for instance , a 2@xmath35 precision in a measurement of the asymmetry at @xmath116 1.5 @xmath29 would reduce to around 0.2@xmath35 at @xmath116 0.5 @xmath29",
    ". however , the previous strategy would not be sufficient by itself if the size and the uncertainty of another effect play a relevant role in the same kinematic region , as seems to be the case with the isospin - mixing discussed above .",
    "several measurements at different momentum transfers would be helpful to distinguish two different contributions if different dependences on this kinematic variable were expected for them .",
    "it is not the case for the two effects under analysis now , since the isospin - mixing contribution also shows a @xmath62-dependence to a very good approximation .",
    "thus we are left with the following situation : both the effects from isospin - mixing ( at least as evaluated in this study ) and from electric strangeness at relatively low momentum transfers in pv scattering from @xmath0c track proportionally to @xmath62 .",
    "this is both good and bad . on the one hand ,",
    "it could be considered to be good if the primary goal is to determine the standard model / radiative effects at very low momentum transfers , for then the isospin / strangeness contributions taken together could be determined at somewhat higher momentum transfers ( between 1 and 1.5 @xmath29 ) where they are expected to dominate and subsequently extrapolated down to low values of @xmath38 , incurring only minor uncertainties . on the other hand",
    ", it is bad because clearly one will not be able to distinguish isospin mixing from strangeness content without another type of input .",
    "possibly pv electron - proton scattering will be done to higher precision and the strangeness content better defined ; or improved studies of elastic scattering from @xmath117he can be made and used to fix the electric strangeness content without much interference from isospin mixing .",
    "concerning the latter idea , in @xcite the size of the isospin - mixing deviation in @xmath117he is estimated to be 0.3@xmath35 even for a momentum transfer of @xmath116 1.5 @xmath29 .",
    "the estimation of the isospin - mixing effect in that work , as well as in @xcite for other @xmath16 nuclei including @xmath0c , is different from the one performed here . it was based on a coulomb perturbation of the nominal @xmath17 ground state that effectively introduces a mixing with an excited @xmath118 state , both 0@xmath30 .",
    "the mixing parameter is proportional to the amplitude of the coulomb perturbation and inversely proportional to the energy difference between the mixed non - perturbed states ; the corresponding pv asymmetry is also dependent on the form factors of the elastic transition on the new ground state , which involves inelastic transitions in the basis previous to the perturbation . the isospin - mixing deviation for @xmath117he obtained in this manner in @xcite",
    "is considered there as a conservative estimation , and the only source of isospin mixing taken into account in those works , as well as in this one , is the coulomb interaction between protons .",
    "precise asymmetry measurements with this target , ideally for a set of different momentum transfers , would help to pin down the strangeness deviation uncertainty .",

    "we have analyzed in this work the sizes and uncertainties of several contributions to the pv asymmetry in polarized electron scattering by @xmath0c related to the structure of the target .",
    "these contributions include distortion of the projectile wave functions due to the coulomb nuclear field , isospin mixing in the nuclear states , strangeness content of the nucleons , inelastic scattering and the effect of meson - exchange currents .",
    "these are analyzed in terms of the induced deviation of the pv asymmetry with respect to the tree - level standard model value .",
    "the determination of other effects , such as dispersive , higher - order or box - diagrammatic corrections can be considered an important goal of the new precision experiments . with this in mind , we have checked the statistical uncertainty expected from the nuclear effects and strangeness in the kinematic regions of interest .",
    "we will summarize here the sizes and theoretical uncertainties these incur at the momentum transfer region of interest , centered at 0.5 @xmath29 .",
    "first , coulomb distortion effects are of a 3@xmath35 size and their theoretical uncertainty has been evaluated here as 0.01 @xmath35 , obtained from reasonable variations of the nuclear charge distribution that provides the distorting field . secondly , the isospin mixing in the nuclear ground state of pure electromagnetic origin accounts for a 0.4@xmath35 average effect , with an uncertainty of 0.1@xmath35 estimated using different nucleon - nucleon interactions in hartree and hartree - fock mean field calculations .",
    "thirdly , the current experimental knowledge of the nucleon strangeness content results in asymmetry deviations up to 1@xmath35 , which is also the uncertainty attached to the effect since the experimental ranges of the content parameters are nearly compatible with zero .",
    "other effects , such as from meson - exchange currents within the nuclear target has been addressed and estimated to be below 0.1@xmath35 , with the same degree of uncertainty due to the fact that this effect modifies the asymmetry only through an interplay with the isospin - mixing and strangeness contributions , provided they are present .",
    "a similar interplay may take place when excited nuclear states are reached in inelastic scattering processes , which is only an issue when their excitation energies are smaller than the experimental energy resolution .",
    "we have shown , however , that the modification to the pv asymmetry induced in @xmath0c by the two excited states below 9.6 mev is zero or very small . according to the above , the strangeness content and the isospin mixing are the main sources of theoretical uncertainties concerning the analysis of the pv asymmetry in @xmath0c .",
    "new experimental information could help improve the situation , and our suggestion in this respect involves measurements with other nuclear targets with a reduced isospin - mixing effect , as well as in other kinematic regions where one expects to have a larger strangeness content contribution .",
