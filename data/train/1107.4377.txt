    "density functional theory @xcite allows to tackle complex quantum systems comprising @xmath0 interacting electrons .",
    "its essence consists on the replacement of the extremely convoluted many - particle electronic interactions with an effective one - body potential , also known as the exchange and correlation potential @xmath1 , whereby the @xmath0-particle hamiltonian is substituted by a fictitious one - particle kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "the exact @xmath1 is however not known and it is a widespread belief that it is not possible to find an analytic exact expression for it .",
    "the popularity of density functional theory ( dft ) has arisen from the fact that semi - empirical fittings of @xmath1 to the exchange and correlation potential of the jellium model in the local density approximation ( lda ) and improvements over it@xcite perform remarkably well for a large majority of materials , molecules and nanostructures .",
    "the qualitative features of the structural and functional properties of many systems are usually well reproduced , and in a number of cases , quantitative agreement can also be reached",
    ". however , these practical implementations of dft are not perfect .",
    "they fail to predict a number of relevant properties , specially for strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "yang and coworkers have discussed some explicit conditions that exact energy functionals must obey@xcite .",
    "dft has also been proposed for tight - binding models of strongly correlated electrons@xcite .",
    "the availability of exact semi - analytical or numerical results for the ground state energy as a function of the electron concentration in the hubbard and the spinless fermion models@xcite has allowed to establish a bethe ansatz lda theory for them@xcite .",
    "an extension of the theory to describe time - dependent external potentials has enabled the description of non - equilibrium electron transport phenomena@xcite . however , bethe ansatz lda theory also has limitations .",
    "first , since the bethe ansatz solution expresses the ground - state energy in terms of the electron concentration , only a local density approximation could be formulated .",
    "second , the analytic formula for ground state energy is exact only at half - filling , while away from it semi - analytical or numerical fittings to the solution of the bethe ansatz equations must be performed .",
    "finally , inhomogeneous systems where strong correlations take place in localized region of them are better described by anderson models . however , the anderson model is bethe ansatz - solvable only if the band of uncorrelated electrons is linearized@xcite , leaving the system energy unbounded from below .",
    "therefore , the ground state energy can not be obtained by a minimization procedure , which renders the bethe ansatz lda approach useless for the anderson model .",
    "the quasi - particle ( qp ) excitation spectrum of a system determines its response to external perturbations according to landau s fermi liquid theory .",
    "furthermore , this spectrum is directly accessible via spectroscopic techniques of different sorts",
    ". it would therefore be quite useful if the kohn - sham ( ks ) eigenstates provided at least a qualitative description of it , as one would expect to happen at least for systems where electronic correlations are weak .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by a vast amount of calculations and comparisons between ks eigenvalues and experimental or numerical data of weakly correlated materials .",
    "however , quantitative agreement is sometimes not so good .",
    "furthermore the ks spectrum is frequently qualitatively wrong in strongly - correlated materials .",
    "notice now that even if the exact @xmath1 of a specific system is known , a possible correspondence between the exact ks and the exact many - body qp spectra is not supported at all by the basic theorems of dft .",
    "an exception is the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) which by janak s theorem is given by the chemical potential of the system , which is a ground - state property@xcite .",
    "in other words , dft predicts the correct position of the homo level of a system , provided that the exact @xmath1 , or a very good approximation to it , is known .",
    "failures to predict the correct position of the homo must therefore be attributed to a poor approximation to the exact @xmath1 .",
    "failures to reproduce the rest of the spectrum could however be due either to limitations of dft proper , or to a poorly approximated functional . indeed , while an exact functional may not provide a good description of the full qp spectrum ,",
    "it is clear that if in addition , the quality of the approximate functional is poor , the proposed spectrum of ks eigenvalues will bear a small resemblance to the true qp spectrum .",
    "since no exact functional for a strongly correlated system has ever been developed , the above two sources of disagreement have never been fully disentangled .",
    "the main goal of this article is to separate them .",
    "we will find the exact ks eigenvalues of several simple models of strongly correlated electrons and compare them with the exact many - body qp spectrum .",
    "this will allow us to understand the size of the self - energy corrections to the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "one of the main sources of disagreement between approximate dft ks eigenvalues and exact qp originates in the mean - field - like treatment of electronic correlations which lie at the heart of lda .",
    "indeed , electrons behave as quantum point particles .",
    "however , mean - field theories replace quantum probabilities by classical clouds of charge . as a result ,",
    "every electron may interact with its own charge cloud , giving rise to spurious direct and exchange self - interaction effects .",
    "additionally , each electron interacts with the clouds of other electrons having opposite spin , leading to what is sometimes called the static correlation error@xcite . for systems containing more than one atom ,",
    "these mean field clouds are spread throughout the whole entity in contrast to electrons which are always point particles and therefore fully localized .",
    "this spread gives rise to further spurious effects termed delocalization errors , which lead to incorrect dissociation energies and qp excitation energies for molecules@xcite .",
    "a prototypical example of the delocalization error is an @xmath3 molecule in the dissocation limit where the two ions are held widely apart .",
    "the single electron in the molecule has equal probability of residing in any of the two atoms , but a measuring proccess will find it fully localized in only one of them",
    ". mean field theories in contrast place half an electron in each ion .",
    "the excitation energy of an added quasi - electron will therefore be different in the two cases@xcite .",
    "improving the description of the qp spectrum therefore implies improving the description of electronic correlations .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation as well as the self - interactions correction scheme@xcite get rid of the self - interaction effect , but not of other mean - field drawbacks .",
    "to go beyond these schemes , the dyson - sham - schlter equation must be used @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the green s function obtained from the approximate ks hamiltonian .",
    "notice that @xmath5 carries already a mean - field description of the electron interaction . a perturbative expansion for the self - energy @xmath6",
    "must then be set up to improve the description of correlations and in particular to amend the destruction of quantum effects brought about by the mean - field approximation .",
    "the gw approximation@xcite has been quite successful in the description of electronic and optical properties directly linked to the qp spectrum@xcite , but does not correct the problems mentioned above .",
    "some recent work by romaniello and coworkers show how the careful inclusion of vertex corrections allows to get rid not only of the self - interaction effects but also of part of the delocalization effects@xcite .",
    "however , delocalization debris remains since molecular dissociation is still not well handled .",
    "in addition , millis and coworkers@xcite have studied the performance of the gw approximation for the anderson model , and shown how this approximation can describe coulomb blockade effects , but fails to describe the emergence of kondo physics@xcite . dynamical mean field theory , implemented together with an accurate impurity - solver , includes many of the most relevant short - range correlation effects@xcite .",
    "we have devised a procedure that has allowed us to find analytic expressions for the exact energy density functional of the single- and double - site anderson , hubbard and spinless fermion models , from which we have been able to write down the corresponding exact hamiltonians @xmath2 .",
    "since the qp spectrum of these models is available analytically from conventional many - body techniques , we have been able to perform explicit and detailed comparisons of the full spectra of exact ks eigenvalues and of exact many - body qp .",
    "we have found that the ks eigenvalue corresponding to the homo level agrees with the corresponding qp state .",
    "this implies that the exact @xmath2 correctly predicts that the lowest energy for electron addition of an @xmath0-electron system is equal to the highest energy for electron removal of the corresponding @xmath7 system@xcite .",
    "we have also found that the exact @xmath2 of the anderson model describes correctly the emergence of the kondo resonance and of other quasi - particles .",
    "however , we find that there exact density functional theory misses pieces of the exact many - body qp spectrum",
    ". a way to improve the description of the spectrum would be to use again the dyson - sham - schlter equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the green s function associated to the exact ks hamiltonian .",
    "we expect that this self - energy and its perturbative expansion should be much simpler than the self - energy defined in eq.(1 ) above , because now the unperturbed green s function retains the full quantum nature of electrons .",
    "our piece of work is complementary to efforts by other groups to provide exact functionals for simplified systems .",
    "we mention here recent work by burke and collaborators , who have found numerically exact density functionals for some one - dimensional models by combining dft with density matrix renormalization group techniques@xcite .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows .",
    "section ii describes the methodology employed to find out exact functionals for systems with a small number of electrons .",
    "this methodology is applied in sections iii and iv to describe the single - site hubbard model , and the double - site anderson model , respectively .",
    "the conclusions are laid down in section v. the solution of the double - site hubbard model is placed in appendix a. the solution of the double - site spinless fermion model can be found in appendix c.",
    "we begin with a description of our method , which is based on the formulation of dft on a lattice@xcite .",
    "we have found that the conventional ensemble - based method to describe non - integer occupations@xcite fails in the formulation of the exact density functional of the single - site model described below .",
    "we have therefore devised an alternative method which is specifically adapted for the description of quantum systems with a small but not necessarily integer number of electrons @xmath0 .    we consider a physical system whose time - evolution is dictated by a tight - binding hamiltonian . as an example , we write explicitly the hamiltonian of the anderson model , @xmath10 where a set of @xmath0 electrons hop back and forth along a chain of @xmath11 atoms , labeled by the index @xmath12 , and to another atom , denoted by the index @xmath13 , where electron correlations take place via a coulomb term @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15index denotes the up and down components of the electron spin .",
    "we use the fock space of states of the system @xmath16 to set up our variational scheme .",
    "site occupations , electron numbers and the expectation value of the hamiltonian are given by @xmath17 we wish to define an energy density functional @xmath18 $ ] whose minimization gives the exact ground state energy @xmath19 and occupations @xmath20 for a target set of electron numbers @xmath21 . to define @xmath22 , we note that every given set of occupations @xmath23 can be reproduced by several states @xmath24 . in other words , if we classify these states in boxes labeled by each occupation set , then each box contains several @xmath24 , and each of these has a different energy @xmath25 .",
    "however , if we choose in each box the state @xmath26 with minimum energy @xmath27 , we achieve a one - to - one correspondence between occupation sets and energies for every box , which allows to define the energy density functional @xmath18=e^{m}$]@xcite .",
    "since there exist in general several sets of occupation numbers @xmath23 giving the same target electron numbers @xmath28 , the ground state energy @xmath19 is obtained by minimizing @xmath22 over all those sets .",
    "this procedure then defines the ground state occupations @xmath29 .",
    "we define now the non - interacting kinetic energy functional @xmath30=q[n_{c , i,\\sigma},n_{d,\\sigma'},u=0]$ ] , and the exchange - correlation functional @xmath31 , from which the exact exchange - correlation potential @xmath1 is obtained by taking partial derivatives @xmath32\\ , & = & \\,\\frac{\\partial e^{xc}}{\\partial n_{c , i,\\sigma}}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , i=1,{\\cal m}\\nonumber \\\\",
    "v_{d,\\sigma}^{xc}[n_{c , i',\\sigma'},n_{d,\\sigma''}]\\ , & = & \\,\\frac{\\partial e^{xc}}{\\partial n_{d,\\sigma}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we do not use a hartree term in the definition of @xmath33 because we have found no traces of such a term in the analytic equations for the exact functionals .",
    "therefore we have found it useless for the purposes of the present discussion .",
    "we define the exact ks hamiltonian as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a double - counting term .",
    "notice that the above procedure allows to define functionals and ks hamiltonians for systems with a fractional electron number .",
    "however , the many - body hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 3 ) commutes with the electron number operator @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the many - body hamiltonian eigenstates must describe an integer number of electrons , unless some degeneracy occurs .",
    "we will see later on that the functional @xmath22 has a polygonal shape , so that the exchange - correlation potentials jump by constants at integer @xmath36 values , which lead to ambiguous definitions of the ks eigenvalues at integer @xmath36 . however , the total energies of the ground- and excited - states of the ks hamiltonian @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are continuous because the the jumps in the summations over ks eigenvalues are counterbalanced by similar jumps in the double - counting terms .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath19 of the exact ks hamiltonian and many - body hamiltonians agree with each other by construction , but this is not so for the total energies of the excited states of both hamiltonians , which are needed to construct the green s functions .",
    "the qp spectrum of the many - body hamiltonian can be compared with the ks and mean - field spectra by looking at the poles and residues of the green s functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we define on this matter the many - body homo level as the qp peak which is partially filled .",
    "the exact @xmath42 and @xmath43 need not agree , except for the pole describing the homo level .",
    "we will use the lehmann representation@xcite to compute @xmath42 for integer @xmath0-values .",
    "in addition , the equations - of - motion method@xcite yields a closed set of equations for @xmath42 for the single - site model .",
    "this method nicely enables to extrapolate the @xmath42-poles to non - integer electron numbers , and agrees with the results obtained using the lehmann representation for integer @xmath0",
    ". the mean field spectrum can be obtained from the eigenvalues of the one - body mean - field hamiltonian , or using the equations - of - motion method for @xmath44 .",
    "the ks spectrum could also be obtained from the eigenvalues of the one - body ks hamiltonian . however , these ks eigenvalues are discontinuous at @xmath0 integer so ambiguities in the ascription of eigenvalues to qps arise for integer @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore essential to use the lehmann representation as a guide .",
    "we close this section by describing an alternative procedure which also allows us to find exact results .",
    "if the exact ground state energy @xmath45 and occupations @xmath46 are found then the schrdinger equation for the kohn - sham hamiltonian can be inverted to find the exact exchange and correlation potential corresponding to the ground state occupations @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "we note however that @xmath48 is not a functional , but rather corresponds to the exchange - correlation potential functional evaluated at the ground state occupations .",
    "this procedure is simpler than the methodology described in this section , but does not allow us to find functionals .",
    "similar methods have been employed by baerend and coworkers@xcite , as well as by helbig and coworkers@xcite to find exact analytical or numerical expressions for the exchange - correlation potential of diatomic molecules in the dissociation limit .",
    "the above methodology can be easily applied to the single - site anderson - hubbard model ( @xmath49 ) , where only two occupations @xmath50 are defined .",
    "the states in the fock space of the single - site model can be expressed using the number basis @xmath51 as @xmath52 the expectation value of the occupation numbers and the energy can then be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 . the simplest way to find @xmath55",
    "$ ] is as follows .",
    "solve first for some of the coefficients @xmath56 using the occupations for the occupation numbers @xmath57 .",
    "those coefficients are then eliminated by inserting them back into the equation for @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting expression is then minimized in terms of the remaining coefficients .",
    "one must be careful though to choose coefficients which are strictly non - zero in a given domain of @xmath0 . in the present case ,",
    "it is best to solve for @xmath58 since these are finite for all @xmath59 different from @xmath60 : @xmath61 the resulting equation for @xmath62 is minimized as @xmath63    the above expressions for the exact functional @xmath22 can be summarized as @xmath64=\\epsilon_{d}\\ , n\\,+\\ , u\\,(n-1)\\,\\theta(n-1)\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this expression gives the correct ground state energy for a system with a target number @xmath66 of electrons @xmath67 note that this ground state energy is spin - degenerate .",
    "subtracting from @xmath22 the non - interacting kinetic energy functional @xmath68=\\epsilon_{d}\\ , n$ ] , and taking a functional derivative , we find the exact exchange - correlation potential @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting ks hamiltonian @xmath70 provides the correct @xmath19 thanks to the double counting term @xmath71 . notice that the ks eigenvalue jumps by @xmath14 exactly at @xmath72 , and is therefore ill - defined at that integer @xmath0-value@xcite .",
    "the density functional @xmath22 has the correct trapezoidal shape@xcite as a function of @xmath36 , from which the right expression for the chemical potential of the system can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 shows flat - plane behavior when plotted as a function of the occupation numbers , as displayed in fig .",
    "we note that yang and coworkers established some exact conditions on the shape of the exact energy functional , from which they deduced such a flat - plane behavior@xcite .",
    "these conditions enabled them to draw an educated plot of the energy functional of the hydrogen atom , which is very similar to our fig . 1 .     of the single - site anderson - hubbard model as a function of @xmath73 , for a value of @xmath74 and of @xmath75 ( in arbitrary units ) . , height=188 ]",
    "we write down now the mean - field hamiltonian of this model @xmath76 where we have subtracted the conventional mean - field double - counting term .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian gives the following estimate for the energy of the system @xmath77 where the spin - degeneracy of the exact solution is lost .",
    "note that in the hubbard and anderson models every electron interacts only with electrons of opposite spin . as a consequence",
    ", the mean - field theory does not suffer from direct or exchange self - interaction effects .",
    "however , because of the mean - field replacement of electron probabilities by charge clouds , an electron of spin @xmath78 interacts with a fraction @xmath79 of electrons of opposite spin , instead of with a full electron of opposite spin with probability @xmath79 . as a consequence , in the paramagnetic solution @xmath80 ,",
    "every electron interacts artificially with a fraction @xmath81 of electrons of opposite spin .",
    "however , the mean - field ground state energy is minimized by the fully spin polarized solutions @xmath82 , in which case the spurious interaction between opposite - spin charge clouds is avoided by a wrong mechanism and , as a consequence , @xmath83 . in contrast , the interacting piece of the exact ks hamiltonian @xmath84 is only activated if a full electron exists already in the system , and therefore retains the full quantum behavior .    .",
    "the shaded gray area shows the position of the many - body poles , where the area is proportional to the weight of the peak .",

    "we analyze first the paramagnetic state where @xmath80 and @xmath86 .",
    "the exact ks green s function is found by combining the equations - of - motion method with the lehmann representation for @xmath87 .",

    "2 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the many - body green s function has two poles , which can be viewed as the ancestors of the lower and upper hubbard bands of the hubbard and anderson models@xcite .",
    "the position of these two poles depends neither on the occupation nor on the spin of the system .",
    "they are separated exactly by an energy @xmath14 and their weight shifts smoothly from one peak to the other as @xmath0 increases . because exact dft is a single - particle theory , its green s function yields a single peak per ks eigenvalues , whose weight equals one .",
    "a remarkable exception happens at @xmath72 , where the ks eigenvalue show an abrupt change from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "notice that both eigenvalues contribute at @xmath72 with equal weight .",
    "the @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) ks eigenvalue exactly agrees with the many - body lower ( upper ) hubbard band precursor .",
    "this non - trivial result allows to draw an important conclusion : even if ks eigenvalues show a jump at integer electron number values , the eigenvalues at both sides of the given @xmath0 contribute to the qp spectrum .",
    "to summarize , the positions and weights of the exact ks and many - body peaks coincide for integer numbers @xmath0 , showing how exact dft keeps the quantum nature of the electrons in spite of being a one - body theory .",
    "the abrupt shift at @xmath72 can be viewed as the way that exact dft uses to retain that quantum nature : if there is less than one electron at the site , then there is no coulomb interaction because the electrons does not interact with itself .",
    "if there is more than one electron , then the coulomb interaction between point particles of opposite spin is activated , rising the energy by @xmath14 .",
    "notice that many - body and exact dft agree on the value of homo level , which is also equal to the chemical potential @xmath93 , defined as the derivative of the total energy with respect to the particle number@xcite .",
    "we must remember however that in this quantum system only states with integer electron numbers @xmath94 are meaningful .",
    "therefore for @xmath72 , the system must contain a full electron with either spin up or down .",
