    "manganese oxides such as la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 and la@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 have been attracting considerable attention since the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr )  @xcite .",
    "these materials crystalize in the perovskite - type lattice structure where the crystal field breaks the symmetry of the atomic wave function of the manganese @xmath4-electrons .",
    "the energetically lower @xmath5 levels are occupied by three localized electrons . due to a strong hund coupling their spins",
    "are aligned , forming a localized corespin with @xmath6 .",
    "the electron configuration of the mn@xmath7 ions is @xmath8 , whereas for mn@xmath9 ions the @xmath10 electron is missing . due to a hybridization of the @xmath10 wave function with the oxygen @xmath11 orbitals , the @xmath10 electrons are itinerant and can move from an mn@xmath7 ion to a neighboring mn@xmath9 via a bridging o@xmath12 .",
    "the interplay of various physical ingredients such as the strong hund coupling ( @xmath13 ) of the itinerant electrons to localized corespins , coulomb correlations , and electron - phonon coupling leads to a rich phase diagram including antiferromagnetic insulating , ferromagnetic metallic and charge ordered domains .",
    "the dynamics of the charge carriers moving in the spin and orbital background shows remarkable dynamical features  @xcite .",
    "since full many - body calculations for a realistic model , including all degrees of freedom , are not possible yet , several approximate studies of simplified models have been performed in order to unravel individual pieces of the rich phase diagram of the manganites .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are generally treated by a kondo lattice model which in the strong hund coupling limit is commonly referred to as the double - exchange ( de ) model , a term introduced by zener  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the correlation of the itinerant @xmath10 electrons is well described by a nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "coulomb interaction .",
    "the on - site hubbard term merely renormalizes the already strong hund coupling . for the kondo model with quantum spins",
    "it is still impossible to derive rigorous numerical or analytical results .",
    "if the s=3/2 corespins are treated classically , however , the model can be treated by unbiased monte carlo techniques .",
    "the impact of quantum spins on the electronic properties has been studied in ref .  .",
    "it appears that quantum effects are important for ( s=1/2 ) corespins or at @xmath14 . for finite temperature and s=3/2 , classical spins present a reasonable approximation .",
    "elaborate monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for the fm kondo model with classical @xmath5 corespins have been performed by dagotto _",

    "@xcite , and by furukawa _",
    "et al . _",
    "static and dynamical properties of the model have been determined .",
    "these studies revealed features ( discontinuity of the mean electron density as a function of the chemical potential , infinite compressibility ) which have been interpreted as signatures of phase - separation ( ps ) .",
    "ps has also been reported  @xcite from computations based on a dynamical mean field treatment of the de model at @xmath14 . a phase diagram and critical exponents of the de model",
    "have been determined with a hybrid mc algorithm@xcite .    in the manganites ,",
    "the hund coupling @xmath13 is much stronger than the kinetic energy .",
    "consequently , configurations are very unlikely in which the electronic spin is antiparallel to the local corespin . the present authors have proposed an effective spinless fermion ( esf ) model  @xcite that takes effects of antiparallel spin configurations into account via virtual excitations . it has been demonstrated that the results of the esf model are in excellent agreement with those of the original kondo model even for moderate values of @xmath13 .",
    "this applies also to features which have been previously interpreted as signatures of ps  @xcite .",
    "taking coulomb interactions into account , ps has been argued to lead to either small@xcite or large@xcite ( nano - scale ) clusters , which have been the basis for a possible though controversial@xcite explanation of cmr@xcite .",
    "moreover , lattice distortions  @xcite are believed to play a crucial role for the cmr effect  @xcite and should also be included in the model .    in this paper , we present a numerical and analytical study of the 1d ferromagnetic kondo model with classical corespins .",
    "we find that the correct physical interpretation of the features which have been interpreted as ps in the one - dimensional model , is rather given by ferromagnetic polarons , i.e.  small fm - regions with _ one single _ trapped charge - carrier , compatible with exact diagonalization results for small clusters  @xcite .",
    "this applies even without n.n .",
    "coulomb repulsion invoked in refs  .",
    "energetically , there is no significant difference between polarons , bi - polarons or even charge accumulations in the ps sense .",
    "it is rather the entropy , which even near zero temperature clearly favors polarons .",
    "the polaron picture allows also a straight forward and obvious explanation of the pseudogap , which has been previously observed in the spectral density  @xcite .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we introduced the uniform hopping approximation ( uha ) , which replaces the influence of the random corespins on the @xmath10 electron dynamics by an effective uniform hopping process .",
    "essential physical features of the original model could be described even quantitatively by uha , while the configuration space , and hence the numerical effort , was reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "besides the numerical advantage , uha also allows the derivation of analytical results in some limiting cases at @xmath14 .    in ref .",
    "we have extended uha to finite temperatures by allowing for thermal fluctuations of the uniform hopping parameter . by taking into account the density of corespin states , it is possible to calculate thermodynamic quantities of one and three - dimensional systems in the uha .",
    "the reliability of this finite - temperature uha has been scrutinized by a detailed comparison of the results for various properties of the ferromagnetic kondo model with unbiased mc data in 1d .    here",
    ", we will generalize uha to regimes , where a single hopping parameter is not sufficient to describe the physics of the fm kondo model .",
    "particularly near half filling , a typical corespin configuration shows small ferromagnetic domains ( polarons ) immerged in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "therefore , two different uha - parameters are necessary to model the impact of the fluctuating corespins on the @xmath10 electron dynamics .",

    "in this paper , we will concentrate solely on properties of the itinerant @xmath10 electrons interacting with the _ local _",
    "@xmath5 corespins .",
    "we also neglect the degeneracy of the @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the @xmath10 electrons are then described by a single - orbital kondo lattice model  @xcite . as proposed by de gennes  @xcite , dagotto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and furukawa  @xcite , the @xmath5 spins  @xmath15 are treated classically , which is equivalent to the limit @xmath16 .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom  @xmath17 are thus replaced by unit vectors @xmath15 , parameterized by polar and azimuthal angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of both corespins and @xmath10-spins is absorbed into the exchange couplings .",
    "it is expedient to use the individual @xmath5 spin direction @xmath15 as the local quantization axis for the spin of the itinerant @xmath10 electrons at the respective sites .",
    "this representation is particularly useful for the @xmath20 limit , but also for the projection technique , which takes into account virtual processes for finite hund coupling . as described in ref .  , the energetically unfavorable states with @xmath10 electrons antiparallel to the local @xmath5 corespins can be integrated out .",
    "this yields the 1d effective spinless fermion model ( esf ) @xmath21 the spinless fermion operators  @xmath22 correspond to spin - up electrons ( relative to the _ local _ corespin - orientation ) only .",
    "the spin index has , therefore , been omitted . with respect to a _ global _ spin - quantization axis the esf model  ( [ eq : h ] ) still contains contributions from both spin - up and spin - down electrons .    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) corresponds to the kinetic energy in tight - binding approximation .",
    "the modified hopping integrals @xmath23 depend upon the @xmath5 corespin orientation @xmath24 where the relative orientation of the @xmath5 corespins at site @xmath25 and @xmath26 enters via @xmath27 these factors depend on the relative angle @xmath28 of corespins @xmath15 and @xmath29 and on some complex phases @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) accounts for virtual hopping processes to antiparallel spin ",
    "corespin configurations and vanishes in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "the last term is a small antiferromagnetic exchange of the corespins .",
    "it should be noted that the unitary transformation to the local spin quantization axis is not unique .",
    "this fact can be exploited to eliminate the phase factors  @xmath30 in 1d .",

    "the spin configurations @xmath39 enter the markov chain according to the weight factor @xmath41 that is computed via exact diagonalization of the corresponding one - particle hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) . in the 1d case",
    "we have performed mc simulations in which spins in domains of random lengths were rotated .",

    "the integral over the corespin states in the partition function ( [ eq : y ] ) can be evaluated approximatively by resorting to a uniform hopping approach ( uha ) @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to replace the impact of the locally fluctuating corespins on the hopping amplitudes by some global average quantity  @xmath48",
