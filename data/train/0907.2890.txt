    "the lmc has a rich star cluster system spanning a wide range of ages and masses .",
    "one striking feature of the lmc cluster system is the existence of an age gap between 3 - 10 gyrs .",
    "four lmc clusters whose integrated colours are consistent with those of intermediate age simple stellar populations have been imaged with the optical imager ( soi ) at the southern telescope for astrophysical research ( soar ) .",
    "we have imaged 3 out of the 5 lmc clusters listed by hunter et al ( 2003 ) as belonging to the age gap .",
    "two of them have been fully reduced .",
    "the images were taken in 2007 with soar / soi telescope in the b , v , and i filters .",
    "a slow readout was used in order to minimise detector noise .",
    "a 2x2 pixel binning was adopted , yielding a spatial scale of 0.154 arcsec / pixel .",
    "seeing was always around 0.8 arcsec .",
    "the exposures were flatfielded , bias subtracted , mosaiched and latter combined .",
    "the photometry was carried out with standard point spread function ( psf ) fitting . the daophot package ( stetson 1994 ) was used to detect sources ( 4 @xmath1 above sky background ) and measure magnitudes .",
    "the psf was modelled as a moffat function with @xmath2 .",
    "photometric calibration was obtained from the standard fields in the northeast arm of the smc ( sharpee et al .",
    "a typical soar / soi image section is shown in figure 1 .",
    "cmds for the fields of the two age gap candidates already reduced are shown in figure 2 .",
    "their colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) reach @xmath3 . from left to right , we show the full soi field cmd , the cmd in the cluster region and the field subtracted cluster cmd .",
    "padova isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are superposed to these latter .",
    "field subtraction was performed statistically , applying the method described in detail by kerber et al .",

    "the adopted metallicity is also shown.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ]    besides the age gap candidates , the soi images also covered other lmc clusters listed in the catalogue by bica et al .",
    "figure 3 shows the field subtracted cmds for them , again with isochrones overlaid .",
    "visual matching of the observed cmds to the isochrone set has allowed us to estimate age , metallicity , distance modulus and reddening for each cluster .",
    "the resulting parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "the original targets , kmk88 - 38 and lmc0531 , turn out to be the relatively old , as expected , with ages @xmath6 gyrs .",
    "however , they are still younger than the lower age limit of the lmc gap . interestingly ,",
    "kmk88 - 39 , lmc0214 and lmc0523 , which lie in the same soi fields ( 5.5arcmin x 5.5 arcmin in size ) , are much younger . lmc0523",
    "final v,(b - v ) cmd has 3 stars in the red clump region .",
    "even though they survived field subtraction , these stars have relatively low probabilities of actually belonging to the cluster , and they are , in fact , absent from the v,(v - i ) cmd .",
    "for lmc0214 we have only b and v images .",
    "the ages for this latter , as well as for kmk88 - 39 are upper limits , as their upper main sequence is close to the saturation limit .",
    "finally , ngc 1878 is a richer and denser cluster .",
    "field subtraction was not as efficient in this case , especially in v,(b - v ) .",
    "we attribute that to crowding effects , which make photometric errors larger in the cluster region than in the field , jeopardising the statistical field subtraction .",
    "still , its v,(v - i ) cmd indicates that ngc 1878 is also younger than 0.5 gyr .",
    "we thus conclude that the sample analysed so far does not contain any cluster located in the lmc age gap .",
    "we are currently reducing the field images of another age gap candidate : lmc0169 .",
    "we are also reducing lower exposure time images of all clusters and perfecting the field subtraction algorithm ; both are important steps towards improving our age and metallicity constraints on the clusters .",
