    "in recent years , there has been a remarkable development in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "one of the most interesting observations is the evidence of the exotic baryon @xmath0 , reported first by the leps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a signal of another exotic state @xmath8 was observed  @xcite .",
    "the spin and parity of @xmath0 and @xmath8 are not yet determined experimentally . since these states can be constructed minimally with five valence quarks , they are called pentaquarks .",
    "evidences of the exotic pentaquarks have been stimulating many theoretical studies  @xcite .    in the study of these exotic particles",
    ", it should be important to identify other members with nonexotic flavors in the same su(3 ) multiplet which the exotic particles belong to .",
    "this is naturally expected from the successes of @xmath9 flavor symmetry with its breaking in hadron masses and interactions  @xcite . in other words",
    ", the existence of exotic particles would require the flavor partners , if the flavor su(3 ) symmetry plays the same role as in the ordinary three - quark baryons .",
    "an interesting proposal was made by jaffe and wilczek  @xcite , based on the assumption of the strong diquark correlation in hadrons and the representation mixing of an octet ( @xmath10 ) with an antidecuplet ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the attractive diquark correlation in the scalar - isoscalar channel leads to the spin and parity @xmath12 for the @xmath0 . with the ideal mixing of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in which states are classified by the number of strange and antistrange quarks , @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances are well fit as members of the multiplet together with the @xmath0",
    "however , it was pointed out that mixing angles close to the ideal one encountered a problem in the decay pattern of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . rather , their decays implied a small mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "this is intuitively understood by observing the broad decay width of @xmath16 and the narrow widths of @xmath15 and @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "employing the @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing scenario , here we examine the possibilities to assign other quantum numbers , such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and search the nucleon partners among the known resonances . for convenience , properties of relevant resonances",
    "are summarized in appendix  [ sec : expinfo ] .",
    "the present study is based on the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , experimental mass spectra and decay widths of the @xmath0 , the @xmath8 and known baryon resonances .",
    "hence , our analysis presented here is phenomenological , but does not rely upon any specific models .",
    "for instance , we do not have to specify the quark contents of the baryons .",
    "although the exotic states require minimally five quarks , nonexotic partners do not have to .",
    "instead , we expect that the resulting properties such as masses and decay rates reflect information from which we hope to learn internal structure of the baryons .",
    "first we briefly discuss the case where the @xmath0 belongs to the pure @xmath11 without mixing with other representations . in this case , the masses of particles belonging to the @xmath11 can be determined by the gell - mann  okubo ( gmo ) mass formula with equal splitting @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hypercharge of the state , and @xmath23 denotes the mass matrix .",
    "note that at this point the spin and parity @xmath24 are not yet specified .",
    "this will be assigned as explained below .    in eq .",
    ", there are two parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are not determined by the flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "however , we can estimate the order of these parameters by considering their physical meanings .",
    "for instance , in a constituent quark model , @xmath11 can be minimally expressed as four quarks and one antiquark .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 should be larger than the masses of three - quark baryons , such as the lowest - lying octet baryons . in this picture",
    ", the mass difference of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 , should be the constituent mass difference of the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 quarks , which is about 100 - 250 mev  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the chiral quark soliton model , @xmath29 is related to the pion nucleon sigma term  @xcite . in this picture @xmath29",
    "can take values in the range of 300 - 400 mev , due to the experimental uncertainty of the pion nucleon sigma term @xmath3264 - 79 mev  @xcite .",
    "note that in the chiral quark model , spin and parity are assigned as @xmath12 for the antidecuplet .",
    "taking into account the above estimation , we test several parameter sets fixed by the experimentally known masses of particles .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tbl : bar10result ] .",
    "first , we determine the parameters by accommodating @xmath2 and @xmath33 in the multiplet . in this case",
    "we obtain the mass of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 states at 1647 and 1753 mev , respectively .",
    "since these values are close to the masses of the @xmath18 baryons @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we expect their spin and parity to be @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath12 , we adopt the @xmath13 as the nucleon partner , and predict the @xmath35 and @xmath39 states .",
    "this assignment corresponds to the original assignment of the prediction  @xcite . for @xmath40 ,",
    "we pick up @xmath41 , and for @xmath4 , n(1700 ) . in the three cases of @xmath42 , the exotic @xmath39 resonance",
    "is predicted to be higher than 2 gev , and the inclusion of @xmath33 in the same multiplet seems to be difficult .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath35 states around 1.8 - 1.9 gev are not well assigned ( either two - star for @xmath12 , or not seen for @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , fitting the masses in the pure antidecuplet scheme seems to favor @xmath38 .",
    "next we study the decay width of the @xmath44 resonances with the above assignments . for the decay of a resonance @xmath45",
    ", we define the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath46 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the relative three momentum of the decaying particles in the resonance rest frame , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the decay width and the mass of the resonance @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath51 is the isospin factor , which takes the value 2 for @xmath5 and 3 for @xmath52 . assuming flavor @xmath9 symmetry , a relation between the coupling constants of @xmath53 and @xmath52 is given by : @xmath54 here we adopt the definition of the coupling constant in ref .",
    "note that this definition is different from refs .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath55 is used . with these formulae   and",
    ", we calculate the decay width of the @xmath0 from those of @xmath52 of the nucleon partner .",
    "results are also shown in table  [ tbl : bar10result ] .",
    "we quote the errors coming from experimental uncertainties in the total decay widths and branching ratios , taken from the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that as the partial wave of the two - body final states becomes higher , the decay width of the resonance becomes narrower , due to the effect of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "considering the experimental width of the @xmath0 , the results of @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath56 are acceptable , but the result of the @xmath38 case , which is of the order of hundred mev , is unrealistic .",
    ".summary of section  [ sec : bar10 ] .",
    "mass spectra and @xmath0 decay width are shown for several assignments of quantum numbers .",
    "for @xmath18 the masses of @xmath58 and @xmath39 are the input parameters , while for @xmath59 , the masses of @xmath58 and @xmath34 are the input parameters",
    ". values in parenthesis are the predictions , and we show the candidates to be assigned for the states .",
