    "the distance has a large uncertainty and the uncertainty relates to uncertainties on the stellar luminosity and , thus , the stellar mass . in the cases of the shortest ( 152 pc ) and longest ( 242 pc ) distance ,",
    "the stellar luminosity @xmath196 is estimated as 4.87 and 5.28 , respectively .",

    ", the luminosity of 5.10 corresponds to about a 17 @xmath4 star .",
    "the minimum and maximum luminosities correspond to about 13 and 20 @xmath4 stars , respectively .",
    "if the distance to betelgeuse is 200 pc , the initial stellar mass is expected to be 17 @xmath4 in our models .",
    "the total neutrino events will be larger and the duration of the neutrino emission will be shorter than the case of the 15 @xmath4 model .",
    "a sn alarm using presn neutrinos could be sent within 24 hours prior to the explosion by kamland , sno+ , juno , and reno-50 .",
    "the evolution of shell burnings after the si core burning could be observed by juno and reno-50 if the mass hierarchy is normal .    if the distance to betelgeuse is @xmath197 pc , the neutrino flux is 1.8 times as large as the case of 200 pc . on the other hand , the initial stellar mass is expected to be @xmath198 . from the integrated neutrino events of the three models , we consider that the total neutrino events could be larger than the case of a @xmath199 star at 200 pc .",
    "the estimation of the sn alarm time is difficult because the period of the si core burning is longer for less massive stars .",
    "when the neutrino flux is 1.8 times larger , the alarm time for the 12 and 15 @xmath4 models by kamland in the low - reactor phase is 21.7 ( 2.6 ) and 27.6 ( 17.1 ) hours before the explosion in the normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy .",
    "we expect from the estimated alarm time that the sn alarm may be sent from kamland and sno+ before the o shell burning starts even in the 13 @xmath4 star in the case of the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "the closer distance also raises the possibility of the observations of the time evolution after the si core burning .",
    "the evolution of shell burnings after the si core burning could be observed more clearly by juno and reno-50 .",
    "combined analysis of juno , reno-50 , and hyper - kamiokande could reveal evidence for the si shell burning within one hour before the explosion . if hyper - kamiokande with gd detects more presn neutrino events , these events give constraints of burning processes from the si core burning .",
    "if the distance to betelgeuse is @xmath200 pc , the neutrino flux is 0.64 times as large as the case of 200 pc , although the initial stellar mass is expected to be @xmath199 . in this case , the expected neutrino events by kamland are 7 and 3 in the normal and inverted mass hierarchies , respectively .",
    "so , the presn neutrino events will be observed by kamland and sno+ even in the distance to betelgeuse of @xmath200 pc .",
    "larger events could be observed by juno , reno-50 , and hyper - kamiokande with a low energy threshold .",
    "we see from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : num60 ] that about twelve events per hour could be observed at @xmath185 hours and , then , the event rate per hour could continue for three hours in the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "so , even in this distance , we could obtain the information in the central region of the presn star from the neutrino events .",
    "we should note that the delayed alarm time by kamland may make it difficult to observe burning processes by juno and reno-50 .",
    "the sn alarm by kamland in the low - reactor phase will be sent at 5.9 ( 0.4 ) hours before the explosion in the normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy . in this case , the o shell burning has started and it is difficult to observe it . if juno is in the low - reactor phase , it will send a sn alarm at 12.5 ( 10.0 ) hours before the explosion in the normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy .",
    "this time is prior to a minimum of the neutrino events per hour in fig .",
    "[ fig : num60 ] .",
    "thus , the evidence for the burning processes after the si core burning may be still possible to be observed by juno and reno-50 .",
    "although stellar evolution models explain many stellar phenomena , there are still uncertainties in their parameters .",
    "the uncertainties will affect the predictions on the neutrino emission in the final stage of the evolution .",
    "the 15 @xmath4 model in @xcite used larger overshoot effect and different convection treatment .",
    "the co - core mass in their model is larger than our model and , thus , the period from the si core burning to the core collapse is shorter .",
    "they do not see clear decrease in the neutrino events by the o and si shell burnings .",
    "the 15 @xmath4 model in @xcite , originally in @xcite , seems to indicate the si burning period similar to our model .",
    "the evidence for the si shell burning is shown in around 12 hours before the explosion in the neutrino luminosity ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) . a small dip of the neutrino luminosity around",
    "four hours before the explosion could be the evidence for the o shell burning .    even in a fixed stellar mass , the co core mass has an uncertainty due to the material mixing by convection and stellar rotation .",
    "this uncertainty affects the time scale of the advanced evolution .",
    "the efficiency of the convection also affects the radial distribution of the neutrino emission through burning processes .",
    "the observation of presn neutrinos will be the first direct observation of the central region of a collapsing massive star . if detailed time evolution of the neutrino events from an evolved massive star is observed , evolution signatures such as the period of the si core burning and si and/or o shell burnings could be revealed .",
    "we considered the msw effect of neutrino oscillations in sn progenitors .",
    "however , we do not consider the earth effect of neutrino oscillations . the time scale of presn neutrinos is the order of day , which is much longer than sn neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino path in the earth changes in one day period .",
    "we would like to take into account this effect in future study .",
    "neutrino forward scattering in sn neutrinos changes the neutrino flavors ( collective oscillations ) and the final neutrino spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in presn stage , since the neutrino flux is still much smaller than in the sn neutrinos , the effect of neutrino self - interaction is expected to be negligible for neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is an interesting problem when neutrino scattering becomes important for neutrino oscillations during the sn explosion .",
    "although there is a large uncertainty in the distance to betelgeuse , we expect in this study that neutrino events will be observed for several to tens hours before betelgeuse explodes as a sn .",
    "the time of the sn alarm strongly depends on the distance , neutrino mass hierarchy , and the background of each neutrino detector .",
    "if the mass hierarchy is normal and the background of kamland and juno is low , the burning processes just before the sn explosion could be revealed through the presn neutrino observations .",
    "hyper - kamiokande with gd could observe thousands presn neutrino events using delayed signals from the gd+@xmath201 reaction despite the uncertainty of the distance .",
    "the neutrino events also become a constraint of the burning processes .",
    "the possibility of nearby sn explosions is expected to be one event per tens - thousand years ; there are about ten evolved stars such as red supergiants and wr stars around a few hundred pc ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the lifetime of the he burning is 10@xmath20210@xmath203 years .",
    "this possibility is certainly small , but we hope that we observe the interior of the evolved massive star directly when a sn explodes in neighbors .",
    "we investigated the dependence of the neutrino emission of presn stars on the initial stellar mass among the three models .",
    "the neutrino events and the period from the si core burning to the collapse phase correlate with the initial mass and final mass .",
    "however , the final mass does not correlate with the initial mass for more massive stars because of larger mass loss effect .",
    "further , even in the three models the fe core mass does not correlate with the initial stellar mass . on the other hand ,",
    "structural characteristics of presn stars for the likelihood of explosion have been investigated .",
    "the compactness parameter @xcite and the mass derivative at the location of the dimensionless entropy per nucleon of @xmath204 @xcite are parameters indicating a likelihood of sn explosion . here",
    ", we discuss whether these parameters become indicators of the neutrino emission from presn stars .",

    "[ fig : cmpct ] , width=226 ]    the compactness parameter @xmath206 is defined by @xmath207 at the core bounce , where @xmath87 is the specified mass coordinate and @xmath208 is the corresponding radius .",
    "however , we are now interested in the neutrino emission during the si core burning and later phase .",
    "so , we investigate the time variation of this parameter .",
    "we consider two cases of the compactness parameter : @xmath87 = 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : cmpct ] shows the time variation of the compact parameters @xmath209 and @xmath205 .",
    "the value of @xmath209 increases during core contraction and decreases during core and shell burnings among the three models .",
    "although the final values of the parameter have a correlation to the neutrino emission of presn stars , they do not reflect the structure outside the final fe core . on the other hand ,",
    "the time variation of @xmath205 is much smaller and the values correlate with the neutrino emission : larger @xmath205 indicates high neutrino emissivity and short time scale of neutrino emission .",
    "it was pointed out that @xmath205 might have a correlation with the period from the core si depletion to the core - collapse @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath205 could be an indicator characterizing the neutrino emission from presn stars .",
    "the relation between the normalized mass inside a dimensionless entropy per nucleon of @xmath204 , @xmath210 , and the mass derivative at this location , @xmath211 , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath212 is linked to the accretion rate of matter @xcite .",
    "we investigated the time evolution of @xmath213 and @xmath212 in the three models .",
    "in the 15 @xmath4 model , @xmath213 changes from the location of the outer boundary of the o / ne layer to the inner boundary of the o / ne layer by the ne shell burning during the si shell burning .",
    "the change of @xmath213 during the evolution is also seen in the 20 @xmath4 model .",
    "the @xmath213 value of the models before the si core burning increases with the order of the 12 , 20 , and 15 @xmath4 model but it increases with the 20 , 15 , and 12 @xmath4 model at the last step .",
    "the mass derivative @xmath212 shows a correlation with the stellar mass but the corresponding values change with the @xmath213 value .",
    "so , @xmath213 and @xmath212 indicate characteristics at the collapsing phase rather than the si burning .",
    "thus , we consider that the compact parameter @xmath205 indicates structure characteristics from the si core burning to the collapsing phase and that it could characterize the neutrino emission from presn stars .",
    "presn stars with larger @xmath205 will emit more neutrinos with shorter time scale of the si burning .",
    "we investigated the neutrino emission of presn stars with the initial mass of 12 , 15 , and 20 @xmath4 from the si core burning until the core collapse .",
    "we showed for the first time detailed time variation of the neutrino emission relating the stellar evolution during the final stage .    the neutrino emission rate and the neutrino average energy increase during the si core burning and the collapsing stage",
    "however , they decrease during the o and si shell burnings .",
    "these nuclear burnings affect properties of the neutrino emission . in these three models ,",
    "larger stellar mass model indicates stronger neutrino emission and shorter period from the si burning to the core collapse .",
    "thus , the observations of presn neutrinos could constrain the structure and burning processes in the central region of a presn star .",
    "then , we estimated the neutrino events that will be observed by current and future neutrino detectors .",
    "after a massive star at @xmath0 pc forms an fe core , the neutrino emission becomes so strong that a few to tens electron antineutrinos will be observed by kamland .",
    "future larger size scintillation detectors such as juno and reno-50 could observe about 30 times as large as neutrino events than kamland .",
    "hyper - kamiokande could also observe hundreds neutrino events if low observable threshold for presn neutrinos is achieved .",
    "we proposed for the first time a possibility of the observations of presn neutrinos by gd - loaded hyper - kamiokande using delayed @xmath1-ray signals from the neutron capture of gd .",
    "although there are still many uncertainties in the threshold energy , detection efficiency , and the background events , hyper - kamiokande has a potential of observing thousands presn neutrino events owing to the large fiducial mass and the energy range of the delayed @xmath1-ray signals .",
    "if more than several neutrino events are observed in a unit time and the event number exceeds the background event number , detailed variation of the neutrino events could be observed .",
    "the decrease in the neutrino event rate will indicate the ignition of the o or si shell burning .",
    "these neutrino observations will be the first direct observation of the central region of a fully evolved star .",
    "sn alarm using presn neutrino events is possible by kamland , sno+ , juno , and reno-50 in one day before the explosion .",
    "the alarm time will strongly depend on background events , especially on reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "monitoring transient neutrino events by multiple neutrino observatories raises the reliability of the sn alarm .",

    "<S> these detectors could observe detailed time variation of neutrino events . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino emission rate increases by the core contraction in the final evolution stage . </S>",
