    "a vast amount of recent theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to the study of and search for spin liquids .",
    "a spin - liquid phase typically exhibits exotic behavior such as quasiparticles with fractionalized quantum numbers , or spin - charge separation .",
    "such behavior is manifestly non - perturbative , and so requires advanced theoretical tools to analyze .    a vast amount of recent theoretical effort has been devoted to understanding how the entanglement properties of a particular state illuminate its physical properties . since a major lesson of condensed matter physics in recent decades was that a phase often can be characterized by a model state , a feature of studying entanglement is that states can be studied directly , without needing to know a specific hamiltonian .",
    "since studying entanglement properties of a model state is often both analytically and numerically more tractable than analyzing a model hamiltonian , much recent progress has been made in condensed matter physics from the former .",
    "the behavior of quantities such as the rnyi entropy thus can be used to explore spin - liquid states directly .",
    "the quantum spin liquids best characterized theoretically are gapped , where a gauge symmetry typically emerges .",
    "an important and useful concept applicable here is topological order , which relates the emergent gauge symmetry to a topological degeneracy , and the related concept of topological entropy @xcite .",
    "however , many experimental systems currently identified as good candidates for spin liquids appear to be _ gapless_. compared to their gapped counterparts , these phases are less amenable to simple unifying attributes such as topological order .",
    "although it is likely that other quantities , related perhaps to correlations or manifestations of long - range entanglement , can be used to characterize gapless phases , few viable examples of _ models _  particularly those tractable by large - scale numerical simulation  are known to contain gapless spin liquids .",
    "we study a particular family of states , resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) states on the square lattice , that are gapless and exhibit spin - liquid - type behavior @xcite .",
    "our main ( but not only ) tool is to analyze a subleading term in the rnyi entropy particularly useful for characterizing gapless systems @xcite .",
    "the rnyi entanglement entropies @xmath3 are defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced density matrix for a region @xmath6 , and the von neumann entropy @xmath7 is defined as the limit @xmath8 .",
    "the term we analyze describes the entanglement between two regions formed by cutting a torus into two cylinders .",
    "this geometry is useful for studying gapless systems because the length of the boundaries separating the cylinders is independent of the area of the cylinders .",
    "because of the long - range correlations , the entanglement entropy of gapless systems will be sensitive to varying the size of the cylinders .",
    "this dependence was studied for three completely different gapless systems in @xcite , and argued to have universal behavior .",
    "one of the results of this paper is to provide additional evidence in support of this assertion .",
    "one model with a gapless rvb ground state , the square - lattice quantum dimer model , is quite amenable to an analytic treatment .",
    "for example , all equal - time correlators diagonal in the dimer basis are those of a classical dimer model @xcite . these can be computed exactly directly in the dimer model by using pfaffian techniques @xcite , or in the continuum limit by utilizing a two - dimensional classical free - boson field theory @xcite .",
    "such exact computations have been done for entanglement quantities as well @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend these methods to compute the two - cylinder entanglement entropy for the quantum dimer model exactly in the scaling limit . for rnyi index @xmath2 greater than a specific ( non - universal ) value @xmath9 , it is simply given by a ratio of cylindrical partition functions .",
    "from this we find for example that the striking even - odd effect observed numerically in @xcite for the @xmath1-invariant rvb state was not a finite - size artifact ; it also occurs for the quantum dimer model , and our computation illuminates its origin .",
    "one lesson from our results is that universal entanglement properties can be qualitatively different for values of the rnyi index @xmath2 . for @xmath10 , the two - cylinder entanglement entropy depends strongly on whether the cylinders are of odd or even length .",
    "this is not shocking from the point of view of the quantum dimer state , because the correlators exhibit similar behavior .",
    "however , at the von neumann point ( @xmath8 ) , no such even - odd effect is possible .",
    "indeed , the shape of the entanglement entropy has to be a concave - down function of @xmath11 , as required by the strong subadditivity property @xcite .",
    "other values of @xmath2 are not constrained by subadditivity , and we will derive this even / odd effect explicitly for the dimer rvb state . thus only for @xmath10 is the rnyi entropy sensitive enough to include this effect .",
    "this effect , whereby a rnyi entropy may exhibit qualitatively different behavior for some higher @xmath2 , is reminiscent of the manifestation of finite - temperature criticality in rnyi entropies for @xmath12 , but not @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to interpolate between the @xmath1-invariant rvb state and the quantum dimer state by considering @xmath0-invariant generalizations of the former ; many aspects of the quantum dimer state then can be extracted from the @xmath14 limit .",
    "such a correspondence can be pushed further : ref .",
    "@xcite defined a cluster expansion of the rvb `` loop gas''@xcite in terms of interacting dimers in the large @xmath15 limit .",
    "one recovers to first non - trivial order the interacting generalization of the dimer model studied in @xcite .",
    "most strikingly , the critical exponent @xmath16 extrapolated to @xmath17 turned out to be in good agreement with the previous numerical studies @xcite .",
    "this expansion also provides some insight in the study of analogous rvb states in three - dimension @xcite .    whereas one can not do exact computations directly in these models outside of the dimer case",
    ", the field theory computation can be extended to a full line of critical points by varying the stiffness of the classical boson .",
    "this line of critical points likely describes the scaling limit of the interacting dimer model @xcite .",
    "we expect that the @xmath0 version studied here also will have the same universal behavior , and by comparing our quantum monte carlo results to the expansion developed in @xcite , we provide strong evidence that the scaling limit of the @xmath18 theories indeed are points on this line .",
    "moreover , we provide consistency checks that the two - cylinder entanglement entropy also behaves universally for @xmath19 .",
    "our results therefore strongly imply that at least the gapless part of the square - lattice rvb state behaves qualitatively similar to the quantum dimer model ; there is no phase transition as @xmath15 is varied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : rvb ] , we review the definition and important properties of the rvb states .",
    "we derive our general result for the rnyi entanglement entropy of many critical rokhsar - kivelson type states , including the quantum dimer state , in section [ sec : shape_general ] .",
    "namely , for @xmath10 the rnyi entropy is given by a simple ratio of 2d classical partition functions .",
    "section [ sec : dimers_entanglement ] explores the consequences of this result in the simplest case of the square lattice quantum dimer state .",
    "we also discuss the emergence of a strong even - odd effect , similar to that first observed in @xcite .",
    "we then turn our attention in section [ sec : correlations ] to the @xmath0 rvb state . by quantum monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we show that while the spin - spin correlations decay exponentially , the dimer - dimer correlations are critical .",
    "the exponent approaches the dimer exponent ( @xmath20 ) as @xmath15 increases , and agrees well with a previous large @xmath15 computation @xcite and earlier numerical results at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we also present further evidence of the underlying coulomb - gas structure for all @xmath15 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : rvb_entanglement ] we present numerical simulations of entanglement for the @xmath0 rvb wave function .",
    "the behavior qualitatively resembles that of the dimer rvb state , and therefore provides strong evidence of universal behavior , in agreement with our main result of sec .",
    "[ sec : shape_general ] .",
    "a paradigm for a spin liquid is the two - dimensional resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) state @xcite .",
    "much effort has gone into its study , since the classic work in the late 80s @xcite . in this section",
    "we introduce and review some of the known properties of these states .",
    "a valence bond is a spin singlet , and a valence - bond state is one where each spin forms a valence bond ( i.e.  a singlet ) with one other spin .",
    "the nearest - neighbor @xmath1 rvb wavefunction is the equal - amplitude superposition of all nearest - neighbor valence - bond ( or singlet ) states of spin-1/2 particles fixed at the sites of some lattice . for the @xmath21-site square lattice , the @xmath1 rvb state is @xmath22 where @xmath23 so each spin @xmath24 on one sublattice is in a singlet with one of its nearest neighbors @xmath25 on the other sublattice .",
    "a valence bond between neighbors @xmath24 and @xmath26 can be labeled by a dimer on this link between @xmath24 and @xmath26 , and so each valence - bond state can be viewed as a dimer configuration @xmath27 with exactly one dimer touching each site .",
    "our computations probe a state directly and so do not require a hamiltonian .",
    "however , it is worth noting that this @xmath1 rvb state is the exact ground state of a quantum spin hamiltonian with local interactions @xcite",
    ".    this rvb state breaks no symmetry , and so is a natural candidate for a state exhibiting spin - liquid behavior .",
    "for example , if the two - dimensional square lattice is periodic ( i.e.  is a torus ) and has an even number of sites in both directions , there is a winding number for each direction .",
    "these are defined simply by counting the dimers around a closed path going straight around a cycle , weighting each dimer by @xmath28 for an even number of steps along the path , @xmath29 for an odd number of steps , with no contribution from empty links .",
    "an rvb state can be defined for each value of the winding numbers , and each will be the ground state of a local hamiltonian .",
    "the number of ground states will then depend on the number of non - trivial cycles , a basic characteristic of topological order .    for the square lattice",
    ", extensive numerical analysis indicates that dimer - dimer correlators in the rvb state decay algebraically @xcite .",
    "a theorem of hastings guarantees that when any local operators have an algebraically decaying correlator , any local hamiltonian with this as a ground state must be gapless @xcite .",
    "thus the square - lattice rvb state could only describe a gapless system .",
    "however , it has long been known , both from numerics and strong analytic arguments , that spin - spin correlators are exponentially decaying @xcite . coupled with the fact that no local order parameter has been found @xcite , it seems very possible that there is a spin gap , and that the state effectively behaves as a spin liquid . in this paper",
    "we do not address this question directly .",
    "instead we focus on the gapless behavior of nearest - neighbor rvb states on the square lattice .",
    "one key tool is to study the _ dimer rvb state _ @xcite .",
    "here one essentially forgets the underlying spins : the only degrees of freedom are the nearest - neighbor dimers .",
    "each configuration of dimers is a linearly independent basis element of the hilbert space of the quantum dimer model , and these dimer `` states '' span the hilbert space .",
    "as above , a dimer configuration @xmath27 has exactly one dimer touching each site of the lattice , i.e.   the dimers are close packed and hard - core . the rvb state for dimers is the equal - amplitude sum over all these states : @xmath30 different dimer configurations are defined to be orthogonal : @xmath31 the `` rk '' hamiltonian @xcite is a simple local hamiltonian with this dimer rvb state as its ground state .",
    "one very convenient feature of the dimer rvb state is that any correlator diagonal in the dimer basis can be computed exactly , because they are exactly those of the two - dimensional classical dimer model .",
    "this follows immediately from the definitions of the state and the inner product .",
    "for example , the normalization of the dimer rvb state is the partition function of the classical dimer model , the number of distinct dimer configurations : @xmath32 which behaves asymptotically on the square lattice as @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "a classic result of classical statistical mechanics is that any correlator in the classical dimer model on any planar lattice can be expressed as a pfaffian @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the model can be rewritten in terms of free fermions @xcite . for the dimer - dimer correlation function",
    ", the asymptotic behavior can easily be obtained using this expression .",
    "for the square lattice long ago this was shown to be algebraically decaying : @xmath34 with exponent @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath36 depends on both the direction and the parity of the number of steps along any path connecting the two dimers ; in some special cases it vanishes and so subleading terms dominate . in fermionic language , the dimer creation operator is a fermion bilinear , and so is of dimension 1 .",
    "algebraic decay occurs only for bipartite lattices ; for non - bipartite lattices , correlators are exponentially decaying , a fact crucial in showing that the triangular - lattice quantum dimer model is in a gapped rvb phase , i.e.  has topological order @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to generalize this construction , with `` enforced '' orthogonality ( [ eq : ortho ] ) , to other models . for example starting from a classical six - vertex model , we get a quantum six - vertex wave function @xcite .",
    "this wave function also has algebraically decaying correlations , with a continuously varying exponent @xmath16 as a function of the vertex weights on its critical line .",
    "the classical model , although in general more complicated than the dimer model , is nevertheless integrable .",
    "it is also constructed with a similar set of constraints , the fully packed and hardcore constraints being replaced by the ice rule .",
    "all the analytical results we will obtain for the entropy of quantum dimers can be straightforwardly generalized to the quantum six - vertex case .",
    "the inner product is an important difference between the dimer and @xmath1 rvb states . in the rvb state ( [ rvbdef1],[rvbdef2 ] )",
    ", the inner product is the usual one for spins : each different spin state in the @xmath37 diagonal basis is orthogonal to the others .",
    "as is easily shown @xcite , this means that different valence - bond states in the spin model are _ not _ orthogonal .",
    "there is a convenient loop - gas description to represent their inner product .",
    "one places the two dimer graphs on top of each other , obtaining the `` transition '' graph .",
    "because of the requirement that there be exactly one dimer per site , this means that the transition graph is comprised of closed loops .",
    "the shortest loops are of length two , when both graphs have a dimer on the same link . using the spin inner product then gives @xcite , @xmath38 @xmath39 being the number of loops in the transition graph . despite this overlap between dimer configurations making analytic computations much more difficult , its presence is convenient in the algorithm used for computing the second rnyi entropy using quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , since `` swapped '' basis configurations ( described in section  [ sec : su2_numerics ] ) will always contribute a non - zero expectation value , even with a naive qmc updating algorithm .    despite this important difference between the dimer and @xmath1 rvb states ,",
    "their obvious similarity makes it plausible that the dimer - dimer correlator will behave similarly in the two cases .",
    "further evidence for this fact is that rewritten in loop language , the spin - spin correlator corresponds to the probability that the two spins are on the same loop .",
    "this decays exponentially for loop models with weight per loop greater than two @xcite , and the inner product ( [ rvbinner ] ) amounts to a weight per loop of 4 @xcite .",
    "this exponential decay arises because the classical partition function is dominated by configurations with many short loops .",
    "thus correlators in the @xmath1 rvb state are dominated by short - loop configurations , i.e.  the dimers .",
    "whereas the presence of longer loops renormalizes the exponent @xmath16 , it seems very likely that dimer - dimer correlators in the rvb state will decay algebraically like they do for the dimer rvb state .",
    "this expectation was convincingly demonstrated numerically @xcite .",
    "the dimer - dimer correlator for dimers was found to be of the form ( [ dimerdimer ] ) with exponent close to @xmath40 .",
    "this is an even weaker falloff than in the dimer rvb state , so the presence of the loops in the inner product of the @xmath1 rvb state only makes this correlator longer - ranged . by the theorem of @xcite , algebraic decay of local operators in a two - dimensional ground state",
    "requires that any local hamiltonian with this ground state be gapless .",
    "thus not only is the quantum dimer model with rk hamiltonian gapless , the spin hamiltonian of ref .",
    "@xcite , whose exact ground state is the @xmath1 rvb state , must be as well .",
    "it is possible to interpolate between the dimer and @xmath1 rvb states , either by dressing the lattice itself @xcite , or by modifying the @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath0 . in the @xmath0 rvb state ,",
    "the `` spins '' have @xmath41 components , and an @xmath0 singlet between sites @xmath24 and @xmath26 is given by @xmath42=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2s+1}}\\sum_{m\\in \\{-s ,- s+1,\\ldots , s\\}}^{}(-1)^{m - s}\\,|m\\rangle_i \\otimes |-m\\rangle_j\\ .\\ ] ] when @xmath24 and @xmath26 are nearest neighbors , such a singlet can be viewed as a dimer occupying the link between @xmath24 and @xmath26 , as in the @xmath1 case . the nearest - neighbor rvb wave function",
    "is then defined as an equally weighted superposition of these valence - bond states ( [ rvbdef1 ] ) as before , with @xmath43   \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : vbbasis}\\ ] ] for @xmath0 valence - bond states , the orthogonality relation becomes @xmath44 where @xmath39 is again the number of loops in the transition graph formed by superimposing the two dimer configurations @xmath27 and @xmath45 .",
    "notice that @xmath39 can be at most @xmath46 , and this happens only when all the loops are trivially flat , i.e when the two dimer configurations are identical .",
    "we have however @xmath47 in the limit @xmath48 ( or equivalently @xmath49 ) . as a result ,",
    "any correlation calculated in the limit @xmath50 will be identical to that in the corresponding dimer model .",
    "it is however important to stress that this argument strictly only holds at the level of correlation functions .",
    "we will present in this paper a variety of results for the @xmath0 case , and show that there is no sign of a phase transition as @xmath15 is varied , thus giving further evidence for the similarity in behavior between the @xmath1 and dimer rvb states .",
    "we will see , for example , that for @xmath18 the dimer - dimer correlator is algebraically decaying , with exponent depending on @xmath15 .",
    "given the changing exponents , the @xmath0 rvb states are obviously not identical to that for dimers , even in the scaling limit .",
    "in fact , we will present strong evidence that equal - time correlators for the dimer and @xmath0 rvb states can all be written in terms of a free boson , or coulomb gas .      a well established and very useful fact",
    "about the classical dimer model is that long - distance properties of the dimers are described by a free bosonic field theory , or coulomb gas .",
    "this can be seen either by taking the continuum limit of the fermionic description ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and then bosonizing the fermions , or by rewriting the dimers in terms of a discrete `` height '' degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "we follow the latter approach , because a careful treatment of the boundary conditions is necessary to obtain our results for the two - cylinder rnyi entropy .",
    "the first step in the mapping of classical dimers on to the coulomb gas is to associate an integer with each face of the lattice , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : height_shift ] .     case .",
    "the coarse - grained height difference between top and bottom is @xmath51 . _",
    "right : _ odd @xmath52 case .",
    "we have @xmath53 . ]",
    "these integers are defined by the following construction . set value on one face ( say the lower leftmost one ) to be zero .",
    "then , turning counterclockwise around a site of the even ( resp .",
    "odd ) sublattice represented by black squares ( resp .  white squares ) , the integer changes by @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) if it crosses a dimer , @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) otherwise . since by construction",
    "these integers are different on adjacent sites , in the bulk one defines a smoother height variable @xmath56 on the sites of the lattice , by averaging the values of the integers on four faces surrounding each point ( and then for convenience s sake multiplying by @xmath57 ) .",
    "then the states where the dimers are arranged in columns correspond to a constant value of the height .    an important subtlety in this mapping is the boundary conditions , which will play a crucial role in understanding the even / odd effect in the two - cylinder rnyi entropy . with periodic boundary conditions and an even number of sites around this cycle ( as in the left and right sides of the figure [ fig : height_shift ] ) , note that means that heights can jump by @xmath58 times an integer on from one side to the other .",
    "with open boundary conditions , as we have at the ends of the cylinder ( the top and bottom of the figure ) , the natural definition of the boundary height comes from averaging the integers along the boundary .",
    "it is then easy to check that for a cylinder of even @xmath59 circumference and length @xmath52 , the height difference between top and bottom satisfies @xmath60 even / odd effects have long been studied in the dimer model @xcite , but to our knowledge they have never been interpreted in the context of the height mapping .",

    "it is ubiquitous in two - dimensional statistical models , as well as in condensed matter , where it describes luttinger liquids . in order to be consistent with periodic boundary conditions , field values shifted by @xmath58",

    "each yields a independent value for the stiffness .",
    "the numerics gave approximately the same value of the stiffness @xmath73 for each , providing strong evidence that the coulomb gas description applies to correlators of _ spin singlets _ in the @xmath1 rvb wave function .",

    "although our derivation applies only to the quantum lifshitz ground state ( i.e.  rvb - type states that can be written in terms of a two - dimensional classical free boson ) , we believe it possible that an analogous formula will apply more generally , in particular to any theory with an rk - type hamiltonian .",

    "the fact that it is consistent with our numerical data for the @xmath1 and dimer rvb wavefunctions is a strong indication that it is universal . we see no particular reason why this universality should be a characteristic only of rvb wave functions , so this conjecture should be tested on future gapless wavefunctions .",
    "indeed , dmrg results for the 2d transverse - field ising model critical point have already exhibited the same type of behavior @xcite . as observed in previous studies of gapless systems @xcite ,",
    "these curves are well approximated by the celebrated universal one - dimensional result @xmath312 ; however , deviations were observed .",

    "<S> we study resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) states on the square lattice of spins and of dimers , as well as @xmath0-invariant states that interpolate between the two . </S>",
    "<S> these states are ground states of gapless models , although the @xmath1-invariant spin rvb state is also believed to be a gapped liquid in its spinful sector . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gapless behavior in spin and dimer rvb states is qualitatively similar by studying the rnyi entropy for splitting a torus into two cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> we compute this exactly for dimers , showing it behaves similarly to the familiar one - dimensional log term , although not identically . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the exact computation to an effective theory believed to interpolate among these states . by numerical calculations for the @xmath1 rvb state and its @xmath0-invariant generalizations , we provide further support for this belief . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the entanglement entropy behaves qualitatively differently for different values of the rnyi index @xmath2 , with large values of @xmath2 proving a more sensitive probe here , by virtue of exhibiting a striking even / odd effect . </S>"
