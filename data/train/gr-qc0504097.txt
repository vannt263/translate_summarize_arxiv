    "a major general relativity principle is the equality of inert and gravitating masses .",
    "however , the classical solutions to the einstein equations ( schwarzschild , kerr , reissner  nordstrm and kerr - newman solutions ) do not satisfy that principle at first sight . for the schwarzschild and kerr solutions the energy - momentum tensor and , hence , self- energy are zero , for the reissner ",
    "nordstrm and kerr  newman solutions the self - energy is infinite , whereas the gravitating mass is finite for all these solutions . a reason for this unconformity can be that the above solutions satisfy the einstein equations not in the entire space .",
    "a property common to all of the solutions is existence of singularity of form , in the metric .",
    "this suggests that the einstein tensor containing second derivatives of the metric can contain the generalized functions , which are lost in the direct differentiation and , therefore , are not included in the energy - momentum tensor.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the paper demonstrates that the einstein tensor for the aforementioned solutions in fact contains the generalized functions , which can be of a more complex nature than the dirac @xmath0-function .",
    "if we require validity of the einstein equations in the _ entire _ space , including @xmath3 , then an appropriate singular term must be added to the energy - momentum tensor . +",
    "it is simplest to elucidate the method determining if the generalized function appears in the singular function differentiation by the example of electrostatics .",
    "the point charge potential + @xmath4 is singular at point @xmath3 and satisfies poisson equation :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 . a method to ascertain",
    "this is the following .",
    "replace potential ( [ phi ] ) by the nonsingular function of form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is heaviside function ( @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) .",
    "having substituted this potential into ( [ puas1 ] ) , we find that @xmath13 will be a solution to the poisson equation for charge density @xmath14 the integral of ( [ rho ] ) over volume is independent of @xmath15 and equal to @xmath16 . in the limit @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ,",
    "i.e. the limit of solution ( [ pc ] ) corresponds to the presence of a point source with charge @xmath16 in the origin of coordinates and is a solution to equation ( [ puas1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that this result is independent of the choice of the potential in range @xmath20 , with the smooth behavior of the potential at point @xmath21 being not necessary .",
    "the result is always single : in the limit @xmath17 , the potential is @xmath22 and the charge density is @xmath23 .",
    "below we apply a similar procedure to the classical solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "what should be meant by the self - energy in the general relativity is not a trivial question .",
    "this question is typically solved using the energy - momentum pseudotensor ( see , e.g. , in ref .   and references thereof ) .",
    "a demerit of the approach is that the system self - energy definition is related to a special ( cartesian ) system of coordinates and is not invariant under the coordinate transformations .",
    "the energy - momentum pseudotensor allows energy density to be assigned to the gravitational field ; the energy density , however , can not be localized .",
    "a self - energy definition can be suggested based on the energy - momentum tensor of fields and material only . for stationary and static solutions",
    "there is killing vector @xmath24 generating conserved current @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the contravariant vector components@xcite . as @xmath27 , conservation law @xmath28    is satisfied .",
    "if the energy density is defined as a zero component of the current , then total energy    @xmath29    will be independent of a choice of the system of coordinates .",
    "the reissner  nordstrm solution is of the form@xcite @xmath30    where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the mass and charge , respectively ) .",
    "this solution satisfies einstein equations @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the electromagnetic field energy- momentum tensor everywhere , except for point @xmath3 , at which the solution is singular . the singularity structure of the tensor @xmath36 and nature of the appearing generalized function can be found out using a procedure similar to that described in section [ el ] .",
    "consider the metric of form ( [ rn ] ) , having substituted the following function for @xmath37 in it : @xmath38    in so doing the metric becomes non - singular and in the limit @xmath39 transfers to metric ( [ rn ] ) .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the metric can be derived from the einstein equations .",
    "the ( 0,0 ) component of the tensor is    @xmath40    in this expression the first term is the electrostatic field energy confined in range @xmath41 .",
    "the second term appearing from the metric smoothing does not disappear in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "the self - energy in the solution constructed is @xmath42    result ( [ ern ] ) can be shown to be independent of the metric smoothing method . in the limit @xmath39 relation ( [ tmnmod ] ) can be written as @xmath43    here @xmath44 is the generalized function determined by the following integration rule : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a bounded smooth function .    for the schwarzschild metric ( @xmath47 in ( [ rn ] ) ) the term @xmath48 in @xmath49 that corresponds to a point source",
    "can be obtained straightforwardly when the presence of term @xmath50 in @xmath51 is considered .",
    "a more complicated generalized function @xmath44 appears as a source when @xmath52 .",
    "it owes its origin to the presence of term @xmath53 in @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the schwarzschild and reissner ",
    "nordstrm solutions can be extended to the entire space , if the point source is added to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "apply the same procedure to the kerr ",
    "newman metric@xcite @xmath54    here @xmath55    where @xmath56 is a space vector , @xmath57 is its module , @xmath58 is determined by equation    @xmath59    it is easy to show that this is an ordinary kerr - schild representation , if vector @xmath60 is directed along axis @xmath61 .",
    "the surfaces of constant @xmath58 are ellipsoids of revolution , whose axis coincides with the direction of the vector @xmath60 . with @xmath3",
    "the ellipsoid degenerates to a disk of radius @xmath57 .",
    "the metric is continuous on the disk , but the components of the metric and electromagnetic field 4-potential and strength undergo a kink , while the electromagnetic field strength a discontinuity ( see fig .  [ fig ] ) .",
    "this means that on the disk there is a singular distribution of mass , charge , and currents , which is not embodied in the electromagnetic field energy - momentum tensor .",
    "construct a solution similar to solution ( [ smod ] ) . to do this , in ( [ kn ] )",
    "replace @xmath62 by function    @xmath63    the constructed solution is continuous everywhere , but has a derivative discontinuity at @xmath21 . to satisfy the einstein equations ,",
    "the ( 0,0)-component of the energy - momentum tensor should be of the following form , @xmath64 @xmath65    @xmath66    where @xmath67 . the contribution to the self - energy made by each of three parts of @xmath68 with @xmath39 constitutes diverging quantities , but in the aggregate the divergencies are surprisingly compensated : @xmath69 @xmath70    @xmath71    the first , second and third lines in this relation are the contributions of ranges @xmath41 , @xmath20 and surface @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "it can be shown that , like for the reissner - nordstrm metric , the result is independent of the smoothing method .",
    "the result obtained also applies to the kerr metric ( it will suffice to set @xmath47 in ( [ kn ] ) ) .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor also allows us to find the total moment of the system .",
    "the contributions to the total moment made by ranges @xmath41 , @xmath20 and surface @xmath21 diverge in the limit @xmath39 , but the divergencies are compensated and the total moment proves equal to @xmath2 .    the difficulties that appeared in the derivation of the relations in this paper have been overcome thanks to code mathematica  5 , wolfram research , inc .",
    "as shown in this paper , for the schwarzschild , kerr , reissner ",
    "nordstrm and kerr  newman solutions to satisfy the einstein equations in the entire space , including @xmath3 , singular terms containing generalized functions should be added to the energy - momentum tensor . in",
    "so doing the total energy proves finite and equal to @xmath72 for any solution . for the nonzero - charge solutions the addition plays the role of poincare tensions , i.e. infinite negative mass",
    "is located at the center .",
    "the existence of negative mass for the nonzero - charge solutions is also evidenced by the fact that for trial particles the gravitational attraction transfers to repulsion even at classical radius @xmath73 .",
    "one can determine this having analyzed the equations of motion of trial particles .",
    "the presence of the singular terms in the energy - momentum tensor follows from the formal requirement of the solution validity in the entire space .",
