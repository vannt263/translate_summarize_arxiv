    "extended x - ray emission produced by inverse compton scattering of cmb photons in distant giant radio sources has been considered several times ( felten & rees 1969 ; schwartz 2002a ; celotti & fabian 2004 ; ghisellini et al 2013 ) .",
    "relativistic electrons with lorentz factor @xmath5 upscatter cmb photons into the soft x - ray band observed around 1 kev .",
    "the boost factor in cmb energy density compensates for surface brightness dimming with redshift . the x - ray phase is also expected to even last longer than the radio phase ( fabian et al 2009 ; mocz et al 2011 ) .",
    "many examples ( e.g. carilli et al 2002 ; scharf et al 2003 ; overzier et al 2005 ; blundell et a ; 2006 ; erlund et al 2006 ; laskar et al 2010 ; smail et a ; 2012 ; smail & blundell 2013 ) of double - lobed sources simultaneously luminous in both radio and x - rays are known across a wide range in redshift up to @xmath0 .",
    "the highest redshift example of a @xmath6 scale double - lobed structure is 4c23.56 ( blundell & fabian 2011 ) at @xmath7 .",
    "when inverse compton losses are considered , the dearth of large radio galaxies at higher redshifts does not necessarily indicate a lack of high redshift jetted sources ( mocz et al 2013 ; ghisellini et al 2014 ) .    at @xmath8 the energy density of",
    "the cmb is over 4000 times greater than at the present epoch and very likely far exceeds that of the magnetic field in any lobes produced by a jet , so making synchrotron radio emission weak and undetectable at ghz frequencies .",
    "hard x - ray emission detected from relativistically - beamed jets by the burst alert telescope ( bat , onboard swift ) implies that the ratio of powerful radio - loud agn to radio - quiet agn strongly increases with redshift ( ghisellini et al 2013 , 2014 ) . the number density obtained when beaming corrections are accounted for nearly matches that of all massive dark matter haloes capable of hosting billion - solar mass black holes above redshift 4 ( ghisellini et al 2013 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that x - ray lobed sources produced by powerful jets exist , and could even be common , at high redshift . in other words ,",
    "high redshift quasars may have powerful jets .    to test whether powerful high redshift quasars generate powerful jets , we searched for linearly extended , diametrically - opposed x - ray lobes around archival x - ray images of two distant quasars , the most extreme object , ulasj1120 + 0641 at @xmath9 , and sdssj1030 + 0524 at @xmath3 .",
    "both have relatively deep xmm exposures ( page et al 2014 and farrah et al 2004 , respectively ) .",
    "schwartz ( 2002b ) has previously searched for x - ray jets around 3 @xmath10 quasars using short ( @xmath11ks ) chandra images without any conclusive result .",
    "neither the chandra image ( which is short , 16ks ) nor the xmm - newton pn + mos image data ( page et al 2014 ; total exposure of 300 ks which on reanalysis gives 120 ks of useable , low background , exposure ) shows any significant linear structure around the quasar ( fig .",
    "a linear structure which is @xmath12 arcmin long ( projected length of 318 kpc at @xmath9 , corresponding to a true length of @xmath13 if inclined at @xmath14  deg to our line of sight ) is seen about one arcmin to the wsw , centred on a weak point source .",
    "the structure either side of the weak source is at a statistically significant flux above the background ( 4.3 sigma ) , but we note smaller blobs ( possibly sources ) at the same surface brightness level and suspect that it may be due to source confusion .",
    "it is difficult to deduce a precise significance for any weak extended structure but note that in this and other xmm images we see no similar linear features . where lines do appear they correlate with chip gaps .",
    "the structure does not align with a chip gap or anything on the exposure map .",
    "the linear feature is present below about 1.5 kev and is best seen between 0.3 - 1 kev .",
    "we shall take this structure as representative of the upper limit of what is undetectable .",
    "no object consistent with high redshift is seen at the position of the weak point x - ray source in hst imaging of the field ( simpson et al mnras submitted ) .    ,",
    "top ) and sdssj1030 + 0524 ( @xmath3 , bottom ) . the energy band of both images is 0.3 - 1kev.,title=\"fig : \" ] , top ) and sdssj1030 + 0524 ( @xmath3 , bottom ) .",
    "the energy band of both images is 0.3 - 1kev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "2 we show the regions used for the source and background overlaid on the merged image and the merged exposure map .",
    "the merged exposure map contains no features that could have caused the observed lobe structure . for the 0.3 - 1 kev band ,",
    "we find a total of 69 ( 48 ) counts for the pn+mos ( pn ) in the two regions ( arms)on either side of the weak source , shown as green boxes in fig .",
    "1 . the background level estimated from the large region indicated by the dashed green box implies an expectation of 41.5 ( 26.5 ) counts in the source boxes .",
    "the arms therefore correspond to 27.5 ( 21.5 ) counts , or 4.3 ( 4.2 ) sigma , above background , which is an observed flux of @xmath15 in the 0.3 - 1 kev band .",
    "correcting the flux for galactic absorption ( hydrogen column density of @xmath16 , kalberla et al 2005 ) gives an intrinsic 2 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath17 .",
    "we henceforth use that value as our detection limit on large linear structures , such as x - ray lobes .",
    "no radio emission has yet been detected from ulasj1120 + 0641 ( momjian et al 2014 ) or its near vicinity ( analogously to the @xmath18 agn hdf130 that only has x - ray lobes , fabian et al 2009 ; mocz et al 2011 ) .",
    "the lack of radio emission in this @xmath2 quasar is consistent with our modeling results if the magnetic field in the lobes is about 10  @xmath19 g .",
    ", which is about a factor of 5 below equipartition .",
    "deeper lower frequency radio imaging could detect faint radio emission from any lobes , if present .",
    "farrah et al ( 2004 ) discuss sdssj1030 + 0524 and its xmm data , which has about 75  ks of useable data .",
    "the x - ray image is shown in fig .  1 ( lower ) and shows some structures close to the quasar which are most probably due to weak confused sources .",
    "we adopt the same upper limit to that for ulasj1120 + 0641 , given the similarities in xmm exposure time .",
    "the source was undetected in the radio band at 1.4  ghz by petric et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the arcmin size , double radio source one arcmin s of the quasar shown in their 1.4ghz radio map is marginally coincident with several weak x - ray sources .",
    "no further information or identification has been made of that radio source .",
    "the luminosity upper limit we have adopted is similar to that predicted by recent models for jetted lobe evolution ( ghisellini et al 2014 ; mocz et al 2013 ) .",
    "the properties of a jet powering a radio lobe at @xmath9 are estimated using the analytic model developed in mocz et al ( 2013 ) .",
    "the model treats the evolution of the hydrodynamics of the radio lobe and derives the synchrotron emission ( in the radio ) and the ic emission ( in the x - rays ) from it , also accounting for adiabatic expansion energy losses .",
    "we fix the magnetic field to @xmath20 g and use fiducial parameters for the injection spectrum and surrounding gas profile ( set [ a ] in mocz et al ( 2011 ) : the injection spectrum is given by a power - law index 2.14 and lorentz factors ranging between 1 to @xmath21 ; the surrounding density profile has a powerlaw index of 1.5 ) .",
    "we assume each lobe has length 185 kpc so that the jet - axis is at 60 deg to our line of sight and model the observed radio lobe at @xmath22 with a ( very powerful ) jet power of @xmath23 per lobe .",
    "the lobes each grow to 185 kpc in @xmath24 .",
    "the observed ) x - ray power ( 1 kev ) of a single lobe given by the model at this point in the evolution is @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "the observed radio power ( 1.4 ghz ) is estimated to be @xmath26 .     with jet power @xmath27 shown as solid lines .",
    "a lobe is also modelled at @xmath28 for comparison , and shown as dashed lines . at higher redshift ,",
    "the energy density of the cmb is larger , resulting in a source that is brighter in its ic emission ( x - ray ) and lower in its synchrotron emission ( radio ) due to ic energy losses of the electrons . the length of each lobe is taken to be 185 kpc which assumes that it is oriented at 60 deg to our line of sight .",
    "leptonic jets are assumed ; if protons are present the jets can carry 10 times more energy . ]",
    "this thus requires a total jet power of @xmath29 acting for over @xmath30 in order for each lobe to grow to longer than 185 kpc . for an accretion efficiency of 0.1",
    "the black hole will have grown by @xmath31 in this jet outburst .",
    "a longer outburst leading to larger lobes . or several shorter outbursts would enable this process to account for much of the black hole mass . if the black hole is spinning rapidly then the accretion efficiency increases and the accretion rate reduces",
    ". however this may be more than offset by a significant proton content to the jets which can increase the jet power tenfold and make the black hole grow much faster .",
    "we have shown that inverse compton lobes produced by powerful jets powered by the central quasar could be currently undectable despite the fact that the jet power rivals that radiated by the quasar .",
    "this becomes more extreme if the jet contains protons as well as electrons .",
    "jets could be the result of the extraction of rotational energy of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , but the accretion disk must amplify the magnetic field needed for the extraction of the black hole spin energy .",
    "this can correspond to the major energy release of the accretion process which , it is widely assumed , powers the quasar .",
    "if substantial energy is extracted from the accretion disc magnetically , then the total power of the source could exceed the eddington limit , a constraint which applies only to the power in photons ( see discussion in ghisellini et al 2013 ) .",
    "a billion @xmath4 black hole can thereby grow from stellar mass by accretion before redshift 7.1 .",
    "the upper limit to any x - ray lobes of ulasj1120 + 0641 ( and sdssj1030 + 0524 ) imply that the process of massive black hole growth at large redshift could include powerful - jetted outflows .",
    "much of the radiation is due to inverse - compton upscattering of cmb photons into the x - ray band .",
    "the enormous mechanical energy of jetted lobes would represent a formidable and fierce form of kinetic feedback on the surrounding gas ( fabian 2012 ) .",
    "this could explain why the galaxy hosts of quasars at @xmath32 are compact ( szomoru et al 2013 ) , and their group and cluster gas have more energy than is explainable by gravitational infall alone ( wu et al 2000 ; mccarthy et al 2012 ) .",
    "powerful jets are a considerable source of energy , magnetic fields and cosmic rays to the intergalactic medium.]and may therefore play a role in reionization of the universe at these early cosmic times .",
    "our results suggest that the high redshift sky could be criss - crossed by x - ray emitting jets and lobes from growing massive black holes .",
    "deeper x - ray imaging with chandra and , in time , athena can test this possibility .",
