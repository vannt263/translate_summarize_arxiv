    "erds conjectured that in fact @xmath16 .",
    "this conjecture is still wide open , although all the above mentioned lower bounds , with the exception of the one due to guth and katz , also apply to @xmath13 .",

    "our argument as presented here yields a little over @xmath31 .",
    "it is quite possible that this bound can be slightly improved through tweaks in different places , though we have abstained from doing so in the interest of simplicity .",
    "as we shall see later , the crucial point in the argument of szemerdi is to estimate in two different ways the number of isosceles triangles determined by the point set @xmath1 .    given a finite point set @xmath1 in the plane , we denote by @xmath32 the number of unordered pairs @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 are three distinct points with @xmath35 .",

    "if @xmath1 is a set of @xmath0 points in general position , then it follows easily that @xmath43 .",
    "dumitrescu @xcite showed that , if @xmath1 is in _ convex position _ , then @xmath44 ; this led him to his improved lower bound for @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we further improve dumitrescu s upper bound for @xmath32 for @xmath1 in convex position . since this is an independently interesting problem , we state it explicitly :    [ problem : isosceles triangles ] what is the largest possible value of @xmath32 , the number of isosceles triangles determined by @xmath1 ( as defined above ) , for a planar @xmath0-point set @xmath1 in convex ( or in general ) position ?    to make our paper self - contained , in the next section we briefly sketch and later use the arguments of moser , szemerdi , and dumitrescu . in section  [ sec : new ] , we prove three auxiliary results , which are then used in section  [ sec : goodedges ] to bound the number of isosceles triangles and finish the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] . section  [ sec : last ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "first , we sketch szemerdi s argument to prove the inequality @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a set of @xmath0 points in general position in the plane , and assume that for every element of @xmath46 , the number of distinct distances to the other @xmath14 points is at most @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the number of isosceles triangles determined by @xmath1 , as defined above .    clearly , we have @xmath48 , because for each pair @xmath49 there exist at most two points @xmath50 with @xmath35 .",
    "this follows from the fact that all such points @xmath42 must lie on the perpendicular bisector of @xmath51 , and @xmath1 has no three collinear points . on the other hand , using the convexity of the function @xmath52 and jensen s inequality , for every point @xmath50 , the number of pairs @xmath53 with @xmath35 is minimized when the @xmath14 points of @xmath54 are distributed among the at most @xmath47 concentric circles around @xmath42 as equally as possible .",
    "that is , the number of such pairs @xmath53 is at least @xmath55 . comparing the two bounds , we obtain @xmath56 which yields that @xmath57 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath58 as stated .",
    "it is obvious from the above argument that if we manage to improve the upper bound on @xmath32 , then we obtain a better lower bound on the largest number of distinct distances measured from a point of @xmath1 .",
    "the following lemma can be found also in @xcite and gives the relation between upper bounds for @xmath32 and lower bounds for @xmath19 .",
    "[ lemma : improvement ] suppose that the number @xmath32 of isosceles triangles determined by an @xmath0-point set @xmath1 ( in general position in the plane ) satisfies @xmath59 for some @xmath60 .",

    "assume , as above , that for every point @xmath46 , the remaining @xmath14 points lie on at most @xmath47 circles centered at @xmath42 . by szemerdi",
    "s proof , we also know that @xmath62 . otherwise , we have @xmath63 , and we are done .",
    "this means that for each point @xmath50 , the number of pairs @xmath53 with @xmath35 is minimized when there are precisely @xmath47 circles around @xmath42 that pass through at least one element of @xmath1 , and each of these circles contains either 2 or 3 points . since @xmath64",
    ", we can assume that in the worst case @xmath65 circles contain 2 points and @xmath66 circles contain 3 points .",
    "thus , the number of pairs @xmath53 with @xmath35 is at least @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 . combining this with the upper bound on @xmath69 , the lemma follows .",

    ", he obtained @xmath71 .    in the present note ,",
    "we slightly improve on dumitrescu s upper bound on @xmath32 for point sets in convex position , and hence on his lower bound for @xmath19 .",
    "for this , we first recall some terminology of moser @xcite and dumitrescu @xcite .    a set of points @xmath72 in convex position",
    "is called a _ cap with endpoints @xmath39 and @xmath40 _ if the elements of @xmath72 can be enumerated in cyclic order , as @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 and there is a circle @xmath75 passing through @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that all @xmath76 lie in the closed region bounded by @xmath51 and the shorter arc of @xmath75 delimited by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
