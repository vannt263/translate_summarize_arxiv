    "`` kerckhoffs principle '' @xcite and shannon s assumption `` the enemy knows the system '' @xcite established the basis for modern cryptography and enhanced secure communication between two parties . with the proposal of the `` one time pad '' @xcite , the security aspect shifted from secure communication to secure key distribution between these two parties . quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , first proposed 1984 @xcite , offers a way to exchange a secret key using the quantum mechanical properties of light as the carrier of information . the security is thereby based on fundamental physical concepts .",
    "first proof of principle experiments for qkd @xcite were followed by practical implementations over long and extremely long distances @xcite . in parallel to these discrete - variable qkd systems , continuous - variable qkd using homodyne detection was proposed  @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that the limit of 3db channel attenuation can be overcome by the concept of postselection  @xcite and the postprocessing method reverse reconciliation  @xcite .",
    "continuous - variable qkd has been tested on quantum channels of up to 25 km length  @xcite using homodyne detection and basis switching . besides using a single homodyne detection , also simultaneous detection of both conjugate quadratures of the signal",
    "was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "homodyne detection of conjugate quadratures referred to as heterodyne detection is particularly interesting for three reasons :    * random numbers are not needed in the receiver s setup . *",
    "the trojan - horse attack  @xcite , where eve gains information by reading the basis choice in bob s setup , is not possible . *",
    "the heterodyne detection strategy achieves higher secure bit rates than schemes with homodyne detection in some qkd protocols  @xcite .",
    "experiments using heterodyne detection on a long fiber channel , however , had not yet been demonstrated .    in this paper , we present a fiber - based qkd - system using a double - homodyne detection setup . as in previous experiments",
    "@xcite , we use binary encoded continuous - variable quantum states consisting of a signal mode and a local oscillator mode .",
    "we adapt our previous polarization - based experiments to a fiber channel . to this end",
    ", our two mode states are sent through the quantum channel using a combination of time  @xcite and polarization multiplexing  @xcite of signal and local oscillator ( lo ) .",
    "therefore , detrimental effects from photon - phonon interactions ( gawbs ) are avoided  @xcite . by describing the sent quantum information in the stokes space  @xcite , it is possible to verify effective entanglement in the measurement data according to the method in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to all previous experiments , not only the signal but also the strong reference beam ( lo ) is considered in this security analysis .",
    "we show how to measure conjugate stokes parameters with a freely drifting interferometric phase .",
    "the phase drift is monitored by additional classical calibration pulses on the quantum channel .",
    "subsequently , bob remaps his measurement data , similar to  @xcite .",
    "finally , monitoring the intensity of the local oscillator at the detection stage allows us to unambiguously demonstrate the generation of quantum - correlated data .",

    "these two signal states @xmath1 and @xmath2 are transmitted through a quantum channel and evolve to the output states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are detected by bob in a heterodyne setup .",
    "bob records the expectation values and variances of two orthogonal quadratures , which allows him to reconstruct a bit value from each signal and to estimate the information potentially extracted by an eavesdropper .",
    "a detailed account of the classical data processing necessary to distill a secret key from the raw measurement outcomes is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this two - state protocol is attractive from an experimental point of view , since the signal preparation is the simplest possible .",
    "theoretically , lower bounds on the achievable secret key rate have been evaluated in ref .",
    "unfortunately , those results are not applicable to practical scenarios , since the key rate drops too quickly with increasing excess noise .",
    "the theory needs further development to make the protocol more robust against noise .    here",
    ", we show that our experiment can establish quantum correlations in the classical data held by alice and bob , which is a necessary precondition for the distillation of a secret key  @xcite .",

    "the action of the quantum channel on the state @xmath8 leads to an effective bipartite quantum state @xmath9 shared by alice and bob .",
    "it is their task to prove that the classical measurement data must come exclusively from entangled @xmath9 , i.e. , their data is quantum correlated .    due to the discrete - continuous structure of the setup , we use the expectation value matrix method  @xcite to verify the existence of quantum correlations . in this method ,",

    "reference  @xcite also reveals a vulnerability of the protocol arising from an attack on the local oscillator mode . in a homodyne setup ,",
    "the assumption that the local oscillator is a strong coherent state allows us to regard the measurement as the single - mode detection of the signal s quadrature  @xcite .",
    "precisely this assumption allows eve to perform an intercept - resend attack which modifies the intensities of signal and local oscillator modes .",
    "such an attack will not show in bob s quadrature detection , but could lead to data which is , at best , classically correlated and therefore not suitable for key generation .",
    "curves show lower bounds for quantum correlations .",

    "then , a suitable expectation value matrix is constructed as follows  @xcite : @xmath16 with @xmath17 separability of the underlying state is then tested through the condition @xmath18 and violation of this certifies effective entanglement .",
    "the remaining stokes operator @xmath19 enters the expectation value matrix through the symmetrizing step @xmath20 , which is instrumental to the verification process .",

    "we now show how this detour can provide a lower bound on @xmath21 :    direct calculation leads to the relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined as the total intensity @xmath24 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : st1 ] ) contains two quantities which are not directly accessible in our experiment , namely @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "the latter is easily replaced by the relation @xmath26 leading to @xmath27 finally , we use the relation @xmath28 to arrive at the desired bound @xmath29 at this point , we can directly apply the expectation value matrix method to verify the existence of quantum correlations , using the approximation ( [ s1est ] ) instead of the actual value of @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : theory ] shows the noise levels for different choices of input intensities , under the assumption that the noise is equal for both quadratures and both signal states .",
    "the variances are normalized by @xmath30 to make the results independent of the local oscillator intensity .",
    "we observe that more noise can be tolerated when smaller signal amplitudes are chosen .",
    "channel losses decrease the tolerable excess noise for quantum - correlated data .",
    "in this section , we first describe alice s and bob s optical hardware .",
    "we then separately discuss the detection scheme and finally explain the control software .",
    "the optical setup of our qkd - system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the alice module consists of a diode laser ( _ slt5411 _ from _ sumitomo electronic industries _ as used in  @xcite ) pulsed by a self - made pulsed current supply .",
    "the laser pulses are approximately 100ns long and have a wavelength of 1549.3 nm .",
    "the line width is 6.6ghz at -10db of optical power and the coherence time is estimated with self - homodyning to be 0.2ns .",
    "the laser pulses are split asymmetrically in the lo and the signal arm .",
    "the smaller fraction is used for the signal preparation .",
    "the signal arm consists of a delay fiber , a mach - zehnder modulator for amplitude modulation , a monitor detector , and an optical attenuator .",
    "this results in a shot noise limited weak signal at the single photon level . in the second fiber beamsplitter ( bs )",
    "the lo pulses and the signal pulses are spatially combined with a 500ns time shift .",
    "additionally , the polarization of the pulses is chosen orthogonal .",
    "the last component in the alice setup is a computer controlled polarization controller pre - compensating the slow polarization drift in the fiber channel .    in the bob module",
    "the signal is demultiplexed with a polarizing beamsplitter ( pbs ) .",
    "we control the second port of the pbs with a physical block to ensure the second input mode is in a vacuum state .",
    "the lo passes a delay fiber , while the signal is directly sent to the free - space detection setup . a monitor diode behind a highly reflective mirror measures the lo energy pulse by pulse .",
    "the polarization control is set such that the power on the monitor diode is maximized .",
    "finally the signal is measured with our detection scheme shown in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ]  ( right ) ) .",
    "the detection system in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ]  ( right ) consists of two homodyne detectors detecting two conjugate quadratures of the signal mode simultaneously .",
    "this was first investigated in @xcite .",
    "our scheme consists of free - space optics and therefore allows for easy and lossless manipulations of the polarization .",
    "the lo s polarization is then chosen to be circular .",
    "the signal s polarization is tilted by 45@xmath31 with respect to h and v polarization .",
    "both beams interfere on a polarization independent 50:50 beam splitter with acute angle of incidence .",
    "for the h - polarized component , we label the relative phase between the signal and the bright lo @xmath32 , where @xmath33 originates from interferometer drifts in sender and receiver modules . the phase shift of @xmath34 between two orthogonally polarized lo components results in a relative phase for the v - components of @xmath35 .",
    "both beams propagate to a pbs , which separates the h- and v - polarization .",
    "the reflected v - components impinge on the first homodyne detector ( hd1 ) , while the transmitted h - components impinge on the second homodyne detector ( hd2 ) .",
    "the difference of the photo currents is recorded .",
    "commonly , homodyne detectors are treated as quadrature detectors .",
    "we calculate the photon number difference @xmath36 detected by hd1 using the linearized field operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real and @xmath41 . additionally , the modes @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the modes orthogonally polarized to signal and lo , are in a vacuum state , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the last assumption is justified ,",
    "since the other input port of the pbs is under bob s control .",
    "the detected signal is found after a straightforward calculation to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a quadrature operator for mode @xmath48 with a phase @xmath49 .",
    "this quadrature measurement is derived analogously for hd2 .",
    "it reads @xmath50 the vacuum input @xmath42 at the pbs adds additional 3db noise to the variance of the measurement .",
    "therefore our setup is equivalent to a standard heterodyne detection .",
    "we do not stabilize the interferometric phase @xmath33 but let it drift freely .",
    "however , we have an inherent stabilization of the relative phase of @xmath51 . therefore two random but conjugate quadratures are measured with hd1 and hd2 .",

    "it is furthermore lossless as opposed to a coupler with fixed splitting ratio  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the electronic circuits .",
    "the difference signal in the homodyne detectors is amplified by charge sensitive amplifiers as in the design by @xcite . the electrical pulse duration produced by the detectors is set to 400ns ( foot ) , which allows for repetition rates up to 2mhz while maintaining linear amplification .",
    "the linearity was confirmed for all four photodiodes independently . due to limitations of computing power , and an electronic signal due to lo light leaking into the signal arm",

    "when varying the lo power for balanced homodyne detection of vacuum , we find a linear behavior of the signal variance versus the lo intensity . for typical lo power of @xmath59 , the electronic noise is 20 db below the signals variance .",
