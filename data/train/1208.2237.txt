    "quantum hall studies of graphene s two dimensional electron system provided the earliest confirmation of the massless dirac character of its bands  grapheneexp1,grapeneexp2 .",
    "similar studies have also confirmed the massive dirac character of bilayer graphene  bands@xcite and are making progress toward revealing the distinct bands of aba and abc trilayers@xcite .",
    "few layer graphene systems stacked in different ways give rise to distinct electronic properties at relevant energy scales which introduces an entirely new class of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems .",
    "recent theoretical work has indicated that except for very weak fields , multilayer graphene systems@xcite can be classified as a new class of 2deg systems from here on referred to as chiral 2degs ( c2degs)@xcite .",
    "c2deg models provide an accurate description of the low - energy properties of few - layer graphene systems with a variety of different stacking arrangements consistent with symmetries .",
    "properties of quasiparticle excitations in c2degs are determined by their chirality index @xmath8 .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion is given by @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is momentum quantum number measured about some special points in the brillouin zone ) and quasiparticles exhibit a berry phase of @xmath11 .",
    "these properties lead to an unusual landau quantization . due to this ,",
    "integer quantum hall effects ( iqhes ) in c2degs are remarkably different from that of semiconducting 2degs .",
    "examples of this are quantum hall effects in single layer , bilayer and trilayer graphene which exhibit unusual iqhes described by dirac continuum models . at low - energies these systems represent the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 instances of the c2degsmin model respectively .",
    "another unique property of c2degs is the presence of a zero - energy ll with degenerate ll orbitals @xmath15 . speaking loosely , quantum states corresponding to cyclotron orbits with different radius , which would have different energies in an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas , are degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is , of course , on top of the normal landau level _ one - state - per - flux - quantum _ degeneracy and the four - fold degeneracy already present due to spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "the zero - energy ll  is thus @xmath16-fold degenerate .",
    "naively it can be anticipated that coulomb interactions will lift the @xmath16-fold degeneracy of the @xmath0 ll by producing spontaneously broken - symmetry ground states with spin , valley pseudospin and ll orbital pseudospin polarizations . as a consequence ,",
    "one would expect quantum hall plateaus at all intermediate integer values of the filling factors from @xmath17 to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this expectation only holds for @xmath19 c2degs , whereas for @xmath20 insulating states in the topmost ll appear generically , which leads to a disappearance of certain hall plateaus  @xcite from the above sequence and a quantization of the hall conductivity @xmath21 at a value corresponding to the _ adjacent _ interaction driven integer quantum hall plateau ( for example , @xmath22 when @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , the presence of wave functions with different spatial structures appearing at the same energy has important consequences on the interaction driven qh states in abc - trilayer graphene ( i.e. c2deg systems with chirality index @xmath24 ) .",
    "in particular due to the ll orbital degeneracy , spin and valley polarized non - uniform states are allowed due to charge modulation in the orbital subspace .",
    "as we show these states only appear for @xmath20 c2degs , and are the main focus of this paper .",
    "the existence of these additional plateaus from spontaneously broken - symmetry ground state has already been confirmed in suspended bilayer graphene samples and bilayer graphene on sio@xmath25/si substratesoctetexperiments as well as in graphene trilayerstricoucheexperiences . by applying an electric potential difference @xmath26 ( or _ bias _ )  between the outermost layers ( where the low - energy sites reside ) of a graphene bilayer , one can control the population of electrons in each layer and open a gap @xmath27 between two adjacent orbital state which is a function of both @xmath2 and the quantizing magnetic field @xmath28 the phase diagram of the c2deg in the @xmath29 space has been studied for bilayer graphene and is very rich .",
    "states with spin and/or layer and/or orbital polarizations are possiblebarlasprl1,barlasprl2,barlasprl3,coteorbital , cotefouquet . at @xmath30",
    "the bias drives a series a transitions from an homogeneous state with finite orbital pseudospin to charge - density - wave states and crystal states where the orbital pseudospin rotates in space@xcite .",
    "interestingly , a similar sequence of transitions has been observed in a thin film of the helical magnet fe@xmath31co@xmath31si using lorentz transmission electron microscopy@xcite . in that system ,",
    "the phase transitions are induced by a transverse magnetic field . in the graphene bilayer , they are induced by @xmath2 potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of both systems are similar .",
    "in particular , they contain a dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite which , in the bilayer , is entirely due to exchange interactions instead of from spin - orbit coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantum hall ferromagnetic states of the c2deg in trilayer graphene s zeroth ll . assuming the layer and spin degrees of freedom are inactive  @xcite",
    ", we only consider the orbital pseudospin at integer filling .",
    "this situation occurs at filling factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 for finite value of @xmath34 or at other filling factors in some specific range of @xmath3 .",
    "the phase diagram consists in a uniform phase which appears at large absolute values of @xmath7 where electrons occupy the lowest energy levels and there is no orbital coherence . upon decreasing the value of @xmath35 , the uniform state shows an instability in the pseudospin wave mode at finite wave vectors @xmath36 .",
    "this instability indicates , in principle , a transition to a unidirectional charge - density - wave state .",
    "we find , however , that this transition is preempted by a first - order transition to a crystal state with a vortex pseudospin texture .",
    "one remarkable result is that this crystal state in the trilayer exists at both positive and negative values of @xmath7 in contrast with the bilayer case where it is found for @xmath37 only .",
    "the pseudospin texture of the crystal is more complex than in bilayer graphene since an electronic state in this system is described not by a cp@xmath38 but by a cp@xmath39 spinor .",
    "this spinor can be decomposed into three distinct pseudospin vectors .",
    "we show that our crystal has a vortex texture in each of these pseudospins but with different vorticities .",
    "we discuss some properties of the crystal and uniform phases in this article .",
    "in particular , we show that these states can be distinguished by their electromagnetic absorption spectrum .",

    "lets us review the properties of c2degs@xcite .",

    "the @xmath61 ll is special since , including the valley and spin degrees of freedom , it is @xmath16-fold degenerate .",
