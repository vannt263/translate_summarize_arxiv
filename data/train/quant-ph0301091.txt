    "two atoms in interaction with a cavity field constitutes an interesting quantum optical system @xcite .",
    "it involves three fully quantized subsystems experimentally accesible and which may be handled ( from the theoretical point of view ) without too many approximations .",
    "the investigation of tripartite systems is particularly attractive specially due to the interest in three - system entanglement with implications on quantum information , for instance @xcite .",
    "we have two subsystems ( atoms ) in principle able to _ store _ quantum information and one subsystem ( field ) able to _ transmit _ quantum information , and one may ask about what kind of correlations could arise between the atomic subsystems in virtue of their interaction with the field .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that such a physical situation has been not fully explored , and deserves further investigation . in most treatments ,",
    "the atoms are supposed to be either both resonant with the electromagnetic field @xcite or both nonresonant @xcite .",
    "here we consider a different ( asymmetric ) situation ; one atom resonant with the cavity field and the other very far from resonance .",
    "the atoms will basically interact via the cavity field , and will show a modified dynamics due to the presence of the other atom . in section 2 we present the solution of our model , and in section 3 we discuss a few aspects of the reduced dynamics of the atomic subsystems . in section 4",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider that two ( two - level ) atoms are coupled to the same mode of the electromagnetic field inside a high - q cavity , so that in the present approach losses will be neglected .",
    "we are also not considering direct coupling ( dipole - dipole type , for instance ) between the atoms in the present work .",
    "atom 1 is in resonance with the cavity field ( of frequency @xmath2 ) , having a coupling constant @xmath3 while atom 2 is out of resonance ( atomic frequency @xmath4 ) . we may therefore treat the atom 2-field interaction in the so - called dispersive limit @xcite , which results in the effective interaction hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding complete hamiltonian may be written as @xmath6.\\label{firsthamil}\\ ] ] the effective atom 2-field coupling constant is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dipole coupling constant , and @xmath9 .",
    "the dispersive approximation is valid provided that @xmath10 .",
    "we are also considering that atom 2 is weakly coupled to the field in the sense that @xmath11 .",
    "the atomic operator @xmath12 refers to the @xmath13-th atom and @xmath14 is the photon number operator .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath15 above may be further transformed into the more convenient interaction picture hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17.\\ ] ]    we may assume that initially the atoms are decoupled from the field , so that we have an initial product state for the whole system @xmath18 i.e. , both atoms prepared in superpositions of their energy eigenstates , and with @xmath19 being the initial arbitrary ( pure ) state of the field . after solving schrdinger s equation , we obtain the following time dependent state vector @xmath20 t } |n-1\\rangle |e_1\\rangle |e_2\\rangle + c_{2;n } e^{-i[\\delta+\\lambda_2(n-1/2)]t }    & + & c_{3;n }   e^{-i(\\delta_n+\\lambda_2/2)t } |n\\rangle |e_1\\rangle |g_2\\rangle + c_{4;n }    e^{-i[\\delta+\\lambda_2(n+1/2)]t } |n+1\\rangle |g_1\\rangle |g_2\\rangle\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the following coefficients @xmath21 where @xmath22 this means that one of the effects of atom 2 is to introduce a phase shift of @xmath23 in such a way that we end up with `` modified '' generalized rabi frequencies @xmath24 .",
    "as an example we may consider a simple initial conditional for the global state ( two atoms @xmath25 field ) @xmath26 or the field in the vacuum state , atom 1 in the excited state and atom 2 in a superposition state . after tracing over the atom 2 as well as the field variables , we obtain the following reduced density operator for atom 1 @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "we note that an important effect of the non - resonant atom 2 on the resonant one ( atom 1 ) is to introduce a frequency shift of @xmath29 , which is equivalent to a ( atom 1-cavity ) detuning , although atom 1 is actually in resonance with the cavity field .",
    "such a result may be viewed as a consequence of the fact that the presence of the nonresonant atom 2 causes a `` cavity frequency pulling '' i.e. , a shift in the cavity frequency @xcite .",
    "the coupling with atom 2 also introduces the oscillatory extra term @xmath30 in the coefficient of @xmath31 .",
    "the reduced density operator for atom 2 will be @xmath32 e^{2i(\\delta+\\lambda_2/2 ) } a_2b^*_2\\,|g_2\\rangle\\langle e_2 | \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\big[\\big ( \\cos\\delta_1 t + i \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2 } \\frac{\\sin\\delta_1",
    "t}{\\delta_1 } \\big)^2   + \\lambda_1 ^ 2\\frac{\\sin^2\\delta_1t}{\\delta_1 ^ 2 } \\big ] e^{-2i(\\delta+\\lambda_2/2 ) } a^*_2b_2\\,|e_2\\rangle\\langle g_2 |\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and finally for the cavity field @xmath33    we would like to remark that even when atom 2 is initially prepared in either @xmath34 @xmath35 or @xmath36 @xmath37 , which are stationary states for atom 2 , there will be substantial changes to the evolution of atom 1 due to phase shifts introduced in the field through the dispersive interaction .",
    "the subsystem atom 2 plays the role of a `` single particle reservoir '' , in the sense that it will induce modifications in the subsystem atom 1 without having its state changed .",
    "therefore the presence of nearby atoms , out of resonance with the field , may influence the dynamics of a resonant atom in a way that they might become a source of decoherence . if atom 2 is initially prepared in a superposition of states @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath36 , we clearly see the influence of atom 2 upon the dynamics of atom 1 , given by terms such as @xmath38 , which are part of the coefficients of both @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in order to better characterize the subsystems evolution",
    "we show some plots of the state purity , defined as @xmath41 .",
    "we have , for atom 1 @xmath42,\\ ] ] and for atom 2 @xmath43 with @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "1 we have the plot of the purities relative to the states of atom 1 , @xmath45 , and atom 2 , @xmath46 , as a function of the scaled time @xmath47 ( for @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . we note a little deviation from ordinary rabi oscillations , due to the presence of atom 2 . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have chosen atom 2 initially in a superposition state , or @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 .",
    "if we increase the value of @xmath52 to @xmath53 for instance , we have the situation shown in fig .",
    "2 . we note a stronger modulation in the oscillations and a clear departure from ordinary rabi oscillations is verified as atom 2 becomes more strongly coupled to the field .",
    "further studies about such a tripartite system are being carried out and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have investigated the problem of the interaction of two two - level atoms with a mode of the quantized field . we have considered one of the atoms ( atom 1 ) to be in exact resonance with the field while the other ( atom 2 ) is very far from resonance .",
    "we have found that , even in the case that atom 2 remains in its initial state , important changes will occur in the dynamics of atom 1 .",
    "the phase changes induced by the dispersive coupling of atom 2 to the field causes a shift in the rabi frequency , as well as a modulation in the oscillations of the atomic inversion .",
