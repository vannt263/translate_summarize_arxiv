    "interfaces between two - dimensional conformal field theories @xcite play an important role in statistical mechanics and string theory . in some sense",
    "they generalise the notion of a conformal field theory in a system with boundary by allowing a transmission of energy and momentum @xcite , entropy @xcite , or other conserved quantities @xcite across the boundary into another critical system . from this point of view ,",
    "transmission and reflection provide a fundamental reason for studying interfaces , with applications arising in fields such as the study of scattering properties through junctions or impurities in @xmath2 dimensional conformal systems ( for recent work in this direction see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "similarly as in the boundary case , there are conditions for field configurations on the interface which preserve some part of the symmetry algebra and render the interface conformal .",
    "the local condition for a conformal interface ( or defect ) is that the flow of energy or momentum parallel to the interface is continuous .",
    "if the interface separates the theories @xmath3 and @xmath4 along the real line , this condition reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic components of the energy - momentum tensor in @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the conformal boundary condition satisfies by setting either side of the equation to zero . on the other hand",
    ", a solution equating the holomorphic components across the interface leads to a topological defect , which can be moved and deformed in the system at no cost of energy .",
    "an immediate consequence of is that the difference between left- and right - moving virasoro central charges matches for the two theories .",
    "all conformal interface conditions are conformal boundary conditions by the `` doubling '' or `` folding '' trick @xcite , which maps the system on one side of the interface onto the other side and considers a suitably defined product cft on the space bounded by the original interface .    compared to topological defects , general conformal interfaces are less well understood .",
    "this applies in particular to interfaces separating cfts with different central charges . one interesting class of such interfaces implements relevant renormalisation group flows , where the cft on one side of the interface admits a perturbation that flows in the infrared to the theory on the other side @xcite .",
    "examples of such interfaces corresponding to relevant rg flows have been constructed in the context of @xmath10 in terms of janus solutions , which interpolate between different embeddings of @xmath11 into @xmath12 in the chern - simons formulation @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "an exact construction was proposed for rg interfaces between virasoro minimal models of adjacent levels , corresponding to the well - known flows studied in @xcite .",
    "this construction was generalised in @xcite to flows between general maximal - embedding coset models . in the case where the flow is perturbatively tractable ,",
    "the rg interface can be obtained as a conformal perturbation defect @xcite by restricting the domain of the perturbation in the orginal uv theory .    as non - local linear operators ,",
    "conformal interfaces encode relations between the adjacent theories .",
    "this includes the more intuitive case where symmetries and dualitites of a particular cft are described by topological defects @xcite , but also more vaguely a notion of how close two cfts are to each other . as an example for the latter aspect we mention the idea that the space of all two - dimensional cfts may admit a distance measure based on the entropy of certain interfaces between any two theories @xcite . in the context of rg interfaces",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that their classification provides a concrete realisation of the counting of rg flows between fixed points .    in the study of rg interfaces we are interested in easily accessible indicators , _",
    "i.e. _ physical quantities that characterise the interface condition .",
    "besides the interface entropy , another such quantity is provided by the reflection / transmission property .    in this paper",
    "we consider the reflection and transmission of energy as defined in @xcite for the case of rg interfaces .",
    "correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor lead to a reflection coefficient @xmath13 and a transmission coefficient @xmath14 , related by @xmath15 . in unitary theories @xmath16 , and the coefficients have the intuitive property that the transmission is equal to 1 for the totally transmissive topological defects , and vanishes for totally reflective boundary conditions .",
    "the definition of the reflection and transmission coefficients can be extended to the rg trajectory .",
    "starting from a totally transmissive identity defect , we expect the transmissivity to decrease ( resp .",
    "the reflectivity to increase ) along the flow . after explaining our setup and notations in section  [ section : setup ] ,",
    "we confirm this expectation perturbatively for all relevant and marginal flows in section  [ section : rt ] .",
    "we compare our calculation at the fixed points with the perturbative formula for the entropy of the rg interface @xcite , and find that the reflection coefficient is related to first order in the simple way to the entropy of the interface . in section  [ section : gp defects ]",
    "we consider the rg defects between coset models mentioned above , and test our perturbative calculation against the exact coefficients obtained from these constructions .",
    "we briefly consider marginal deformations of the free boson in section  [ section : limitcases ] , and conclude in section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "some technical steps of sections  [ section : rt ] and [ section : gp defects ] are collected in the appendix .",
    "for reasons of later convenience we consider the system on a torus , split into two cylindrical halves . on one half",
    "the system is at its uv fixed point , on the other half it is described by an ir cft obtained from the uv by a relevant but almost marginal perturbation .",
    "the torus is stretched such that we can describe the region around one of the interfaces in terms of a long cylinder of circumference  @xmath17 . at the ends of the cylinder we will prescribe asymptotic states @xmath18 of the uv and ir theory , respectively ( see figure  [ setup ] ) .",
    "we will use coordinates @xmath19 on the cylinder geometry .",
    "( 0,0)(9,2.5 ) ( 4.8,0.5 ) .",
    "the defect wraps the cylinder at @xmath20 .",

    "the flow admits an ir fixed point perturbatively close to the original uv fixed point . in the ir the value of the renormalised coupling",
    "constant is of the order of the anomalous dimension @xmath43 , @xmath44 and expansion in @xmath45 ( or , equivalently , @xmath43 ) is valid at the new fixed point  @xcite .",
    "recall that the value of correlation functions of a collection of ( renormalised ) local operators @xmath46 in the perturbed theory is given by @xmath47 where correlation functions without any subscripts denote those of the uv cft .",
    "all our computations will effectively be performed on the plane with coordinates . in these coordinates ,",
    "the interface is wrapped around the unit circle . unless otherwise stated ,",
    "all correlation functions in the following will be understood with respect to these planar coordinates .",
    "the perturbation can be written on the plane as @xmath48 observe that this perturbation is invariant under @xmath49 . in the presence of the defect ,",
    "the integral only runs over @xmath50 , _",
    "i.e. _ the unit disc in the coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "we will regularise uv divergences by a position - space cutoff @xmath52 on the cylinder , with @xmath53 . besides the uv cut - off we will also need a large - distance cut - off @xmath54 on the cylinder , such that @xmath55 .",
    "all cut - offs need to be transformed accordingly when we change coordinates .",
    "however , in all coordinates we are about to employ it will be sufficient to keep only the lowest order in the expansions of small @xmath56 ( or large @xmath54 ) , and thus use circular cut - offs .",
    "a definition for measuring reflection and transmission across a conformal interface was given in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent refinement to multi - junctions ) .",
    "the definition is based on the correlation of energy - momentum tensor components on the plane . for a conformal interface wrapped around the unit circle , separating two fixed points @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ", we define the unitary matrix @xmath57 here @xmath58 are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic energy - momentum tensor components of the plane , and @xmath59 is the vacuum state in @xmath8 .",
    "reflection @xmath13 and transmission @xmath14 are defined by means of the matrix @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "obviously we have the intuitive relation @xmath63 as was shown in @xcite , the matrix @xmath60 is actually fixed by conformal symmetry up to a single free parameter , determined by the precise interface condition . here",
    "we will keep working with the more intuitve matrix @xmath60 . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "its entries are closely related to the transmission of ( bulk ) entropy through quantum wire junctions as considered in @xcite .",
    "+ the definition of the matrix @xmath60 can be extended to rg trajectories between conformal fixed points . in the following we compute @xmath60 for a perturbative conformal defect on our cylinder geometry .",
    "after perturbation , the entries of @xmath60 will be of the form @xmath64 since we are interested mostly in the result close to the ir fixed point , we will further expand the coefficients of each order of @xmath33 in the parameter @xmath43 , and only keep the terms necessary for a consistent expansion in the ir .",
    "more concretely this means that @xmath65 will be expanded to the first subleading and @xmath66 to the leading order in @xmath43 .",
    "notice that at the fixed points the normalisation constant in is given by the disc one - point function of the bulk operator @xmath67 in the folded picture , @xmath68 here @xmath69 denotes the central charge of @xmath8 . under perturbation ,",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath70 is therefore determined from the change in the central charge of the theory on the perturbed side of the defect .",
    "the perturbative change of the central charge was computed in @xcite , in the same scheme as we are employing here .",
    "it is therefore possible to derive the value of @xmath71 from the values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 not only at the fixed points , but for the full perturbative result in our scheme .",
    "we will calculate the perturbative change of @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the sections  [ section : secondorder ] and [ section : thirdorder ] , and turn to the off - diagonal entries after that in section  [ section : perturbative result ] , where we also collect the results of the perturbative calculation .",
    "notice that @xmath74 , such that the perturbative change of the one - point function in the numerator up to the order @xmath75 drops out in the calculation of the diagonal entries .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath76 in @xmath72 reads @xmath77 with @xmath78 we choose @xmath79 at the cost of an additional factor of 2 , and set @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "then we have @xmath82 we expand @xmath83 drops out by the angular integration . without the need of a cutoff in this particular calculation we find @xmath84 the second - order coefficient in @xmath73 reads @xmath85 with @xmath86 there are now power - law divergences when the @xmath28 insertions at @xmath87 and @xmath88 approach the energy - momentum tensor at the origin , while the situation where the @xmath28 insertions are close to each other is still suppressed .",
    "the coordinate transformation @xmath80 gives @xmath89 using again one finds @xmath90 notice that the cut - off for @xmath91 is @xmath92 . using minimal subtraction",
    "we obtain @xmath93 restoring the prefactors from and we therefore have @xmath94      recall that in order to calculate quantities at the ir fixed point to third order in the value of the coupling constant , we only need to compute the leading order contributions in @xmath43 of the third- order coefficients @xmath66 .",
    "the third - order coefficient in @xmath72 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 to leading order in @xmath43 the expression for @xmath97 simplifies to @xmath98 we defer the details of performing this integral to appendix  [ appendix : perturbativecalculations ] , and will only state the result here . as might be intuitively clear from , the integration of the first summand in the bracket of the last line is a pure counterterm in our scheme , @xmath99 for the computation of the other contribution to , no cut - off is necessary , and one obtains @xmath100 combining and , @xmath97 is therefore , to leading order in @xmath43 , @xmath101 finally , the coefficient of the third - order contribution to @xmath73 reads @xmath102 here , @xmath103 we are again only interested in the leading - order term in @xmath43 .",
    "similarly as in the computation of @xmath72 we order @xmath104 at the cost of an additional factor of 6 , and replace @xmath105 the integral one has to calculate then becomes @xmath106 the integration can be performed with the same methods as before for @xmath72 ; the interested reader can find more details in appendix  [ appendix : perturbativecalculations ] .",
    "eventually the result of the integration of yields @xmath107      the perturbative result for @xmath72 and @xmath73 up to third order in the coupling constant @xmath33 is now obtained from , , , , and : @xmath108 as mentioned before , the coefficients are expanded such that the final result at the fixed point is valid up to third order in the anomalous dimension @xmath43 .",
    "we observe that @xmath73 , which measures the reflection on the ir side of the rg defect , is smaller than the reflection measured by @xmath72 on the uv side .",
    "this illustrates the notion of information loss along the rg flow  intuitively , modes sent towards the defect from the uv side have a lower chance of finding a suitable form for transmission than vice versa .",
    "notice also that for the case of marginal flows ( @xmath109 ) , the expressions for @xmath72 and @xmath73 coincide .    as mentioned in the beginning of section  [ section : rt ]",
    ", we can compute the perturbative result for @xmath71 from the change in the central charge . employing the same scheme as we do here ,",
    "the general result for the perturbed central charge was obtained in @xcite , @xmath110 from we see that @xmath111 such that up to third order in @xmath33 we have @xmath112 notice that the coefficient of @xmath75 vanishes to leading order in @xmath43 , which means that to this order the coefficient is given by a pure counterterm in our scheme .",
    "we can now combine and to compute the reflection and transmission coefficients from : @xmath113 let us write out the result for @xmath13 at the fixed point . from the value of the coupling constant we obtain @xmath114 it turns out that to this order in perturbation , the reflection coefficient is related in a rather simple way to the entropy of the rg interface .",
    "the entropy is the logarithm of the @xmath115 factor @xcite , which corresponds to the overlap of the vacua across the interface . for rg interfaces ,",
    "the perturbative calculation of the @xmath115 factor was done in @xcite , with the result @xmath116 at the ir fixed point . to lowest order ,",
    "the transmission and the interface entropy thus contain the same information .",
    "we emphasise however that the entropy can not be a universal function of the transmission to higher orders .",
    "one intuitive reason is that the reflection is determined only from the vacuum representation , while the @xmath115 factor is involved in cardy s condition , and thus in general must contain more subtle information about the cft .",
    "we will see an explicit example for this in the next section .",
    "in this section we check our perturbative result , , , and for flows between cfts whose chiral algebra is a maximally - embedded coset of the affine algebra @xmath117 associated to the simple lie algebra @xmath118 .",
    "the coset algebra reads @xmath119 we consider the diagonal modular invariant . the constituent wzw model based on the affine algebra",
    "@xmath120 has central charge @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the dual coxeter number of @xmath118 .",
    "the coset cft therefore has central charge @xmath123 for @xmath124 these coset cfts admit perturbations leading to massless theories , with rg flows between the fixed points @xcite @xmath125 a well - known instance of such a sequence of flows exists between the virasoro minimal models , where @xmath126 , @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "the perturbing field in the uv theory is the primary coset operator in the representation @xmath128 .",
    "it has conformal dimension @xmath129 along the flow , the perturbation does not mix with other relevant fields to all orders in perturbation theory . from the ir point of view , in cases where @xmath130 the flow is described by an irrelevant perturbation by the operator associated with the representation @xmath131 of @xmath132 .",
    "this operator has the conformal dimension @xmath133 the rg interfaces for these flows have been worked out in @xcite for the case of the virasoro minimal models , and generalised to the flow in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we briefly repeat the construction in the folded picture , where the defect corresponds to a boundary state on the unit circle . from basic properties of topological defects under the rg flow ,",
    "one deduces that the defect must be in a class which preserves specific symmetry of the folded theory @xmath134 . as a first result",
    "it was noted in @xcite that the only non - trivial one - point functions in the doubled theory with the boundary condition corresponding to the rg defect correspond to a projected sector .",
    "the projection @xmath135 is onto states which have the same representation label in the two copies of the algebra @xmath120  one appearing in the numerator of @xmath136 , and the other appearing in the denominator of @xmath132 .",
    "the projection is thus given by a map @xmath137 let @xmath138 denote a representation of the affine chiral algebra @xmath139 , and we write @xmath140 for a representation of @xmath136 as before .",
    "a representation @xmath141 of the right - hand side in is the image of the direct sum @xmath142 the rg interface corresponds to a fusion product of a boundary condition for the chiral algebra on the right - hand side of with a topological defect interpolating between the two sides .",
    "let us first consider the boundary condition .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the boundary condition must preserve the symmetry in the way @xmath143",
    "_ i.e. _ it must correspond to a standard ( cardy ) state on the coset part , multiplied with a @xmath144 permutation brane for the @xmath145 factors .",
    "such a state has the form @xcite @xmath146 here , @xmath147 is a modular s matrix element of the wzw model based on @xmath139 , where we dropped the superscripts on the representation indices for brevity . in the permutation part ,",
    "the two representations of @xmath145 are exchanged , forcing the respective representation labels to be equal . in our notation for the ishibashi state and the boundary state we kept the information on the permutation part by the subscript @xmath144 .    as mentioned before",
    ", the boundary state must be fused with a topological defect interpolating between the left- and the right - hand side of .",
    "the important consistency condition for such a topological defect is that the fusion product of the defect with its conjugate must be a linear superposition of standard cardy defects with non - negative integer coefficients .",
    "as was demonstrated in  @xcite , one solution to this constraint is an operator of the form @xmath148 where we use @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) to refer to the left(right)-hand side of , and @xmath118 ( @xmath151 ) denote irreducible representations in @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath152 stands for the ishibashi operator which maps the representation @xmath118 to the copy of @xmath118 within the representation @xmath151 .    from the perturbative results in the large-@xmath153 limit it was then conjectured in @xcite that the rg defect corresponds to the boundary state @xmath154",
    "the construction specifies the overlap between an operator @xmath155 in the uv and an operator @xmath156 in the ir .",
    "writing both operators in terms of their chiral components @xmath157 , their overlap is given by a disc one - point function of the operator and @xmath158 is reversed .",
    "we believe that the construction here is more intuitive given that we have performed the folding trick .",
    "since the original theories are assumed left - right symmetric , this has no effect on the formulae . ]",
    "@xmath159 interpreted in the theory with chiral algebra , @xmath160 in the last expression , we find from , and   that @xmath161 .",
    "+ notice that in hindsight , the symmetries that must be respected by the defect may not come as a surprise . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the perturbed theories generically still contain two ( non - local ) chiral symmetry currents , which commute with the perturbation and among themselves to all orders .",
    "one current is associated with the representation @xmath131 and thus with the algebra factor @xmath120 .",
    "the other one is associated with @xmath162 , resp . the algebra factor @xmath145 .",

    "the reflection coefficient is the average of the reflections on the uv and the ir side of the interface .",
    "at least perturbatively , and in the examples we considered , the uv reflection is larger than the ir reflection in the case of relevant perturbations , and the two quantities are equal for marginal perturbations . from the results for the matrix @xmath60 we derived the perturbative relation between the reflection coefficient and the entropy of the rg interface at the fixed point .",
    "the perturbative result agrees with the one obtained from explicit rg interface solutions @xcite of coset model flows .",

    "there are however cases where too few parameters are present in the theory , and @xmath115 can in fact be written as a function purely of @xmath13 and @xmath226 . a simple case where this occurs are exactly marginal deformations of the compactified free boson , leading to the relation .    as a side remark we pointed out that the limit of the coset perturbations considered in section  [ section : gp defects ] will not become exactly marginal deformations of the continuous orbifold in the limit of infinite level @xmath153 .",
    "rather , for @xmath199 the perturbation is marginally irrelevant , while for @xmath227 it is marginally relevant .",

    "the rg flows of these perturbations are non - perturbative , and therefore we refrained from considering them here . since the ir theories are trivial , we expect that the rg interfaces are given by a particular boundary condition in the uv theory @xmath136 , _ i.e. _ a totally reflective rg interface",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if this boundary condition has infinite entropy , or if one can associate a particular boundary condition at finite entropy to these massive flows .",
    "it seems plausible that any rg flow with a non - trivial ir fixed point ( to be more precise , any rg flow where the ir theory contains an energy - momentum tensor and is not a degeneration limit ) corresponds to an interface with @xmath228 .    for our coset model",
    "the case @xmath229 , @xmath127 leads to the @xmath230 theories , _",
    "i.e. _ to the bosonic version of the cft duals to higher spin algebras on @xmath231 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to have an interpretation of these rg interfaces in the @xmath231 bulk .",
    "in that context we would also like to understand the fusion of two rg interfaces @xcite , and how reflection and transmission behave under it .",
    "another more general point that we have not touched at all is whether the reflection of an rg interface is always minimal among the interfaces which preserve the same symmetry as the rg flow .",
    "it seems plausible that this is related to the stability of the rg interface under boundary perturbations .",
    "it would also be interesting to prove that the off - critical definition of @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) indeed provides a quantity which behaves monotonically along ( non - perturbative ) relevant rg flows .    finally ,",
    "while we have focused solely on the reflection and transmission of virasoro modes , studying the reflection and transmission of conserved currents might lead to a more refined picture of the set of rg interfaces .",
