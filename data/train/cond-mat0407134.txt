    "in a recent series of interesting papers j. leon and coworkers  @xcite discovered that nonlinear chains driven at a boundary can propagate energy in the forbidden band gap .",
    "numerical experiments were performed for harmonic driving , and the semi - infinite chain idealization was simulated by adding damping on the boundary opposite to driving . in this case ,",
    "energy transmission occurs above a well defined ( frequency dependent ) critical amplitude .",
    "this phenomenon has been called _ nonlinear supratransmission _ by the authors , and is characterized by the propagation of nonlinear localized modes ( gap solitons ) inside the bulk .",
    "several models have been considered : sine - gordon and klein - gordon  @xcite , double sine - gordon and josephson transmission lines  @xcite , bragg media  @xcite , and an experimental realization has been proposed for a mechanical system of coupled pendula  @xcite .",
    "the generic features of the supratransmission instability have been described in terms of an evanescent wave destabilization  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the same process has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , suggesting an experimental application to optical waveguide arrays .    in this paper",
    "we show that the supratransmission phenomenon is present for fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) nonlinear chains  @xcite . at variance with all previously considered cases ,",
    "the harmonic driving frequency must lie above the phonon band , since the fpu interparticle potential is translationally invariant and , hence , a forbidden lower band does not exist ( the phonon spectrum begins at zero frequency ) .",
    "this entails that the nonlinear modes which propagate in the bulk are moving _ discrete breathers",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "exact static discrete breathers profiles have been presented in the literature , but here we use approximate analytic expressions for both the low - amplitude solitonic case and for the large amplitude situation  @xcite .",
    "this allows to perform a study of the instability at the boundary and a detailed analysis of the process which leads to the birth and the propagation of the discrete breather . by using these approximate solutions , we are able to provide analytic expressions for the supratransmission critical amplitudes as a function of the forcing frequencies , which are then successfully compared with numerically determined values .    besides that",
    ", we analyse the long - time behavior of the system , studying the formation of a stationary state with a given energy flux across the chain . the _ order parameter _ of the transition from the _ insulating _ to the _ conducting _ state is , indeed , the average energy flux , which displays a jump at the supratrasmission threshold ( which could then be thought as a sort of non - equilibrium first - order transition ) .",
    "we discover that lowering the amplitude below the threshold , after the stationary state is established , does not interrupt trasmission : the _ conducting _ state survives even at smaller amplitudes and coexists with the _ insulating _ state ( a sort of bistability is present in the system ) . by further reducing the amplitude , a threshold appears below which the energy flux vanishes without any apparent discontinuity ( here we have a sort of second - order transition ) : we develop a theoretical analysis of this new threshold phenomenon , which was absent in previous studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and the equations of motion .",
    "section iii deals with the calculation of the energy flux in the quasi - linear approximation .",
    "section iv illustrates all analytic and numerical results concerning the determination of the supratransmission threshold .",
    "section v is devoted to the characterization of the stationary states and of their bistability .",
    "section vi contains some conclusions . in the appendix we report , for completeness , a calculation of the nonlinear phonon dispersion relation",
    "we consider the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) chain  @xcite , which is an extremely well studied nonlinear lattice for which a large class of quasi - harmonic and localized solutions is known .",
    "the equations of motion for the so - called @xmath0-fpu chain ( interparticle potential with a quadratic and a quartic term ) are @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the displacement of @xmath3-th site in dimensionless units ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "all force parameters have been chosen equal to unity for computational convenience .    to simulate the effect of an impinging wave we impose the boundary condition @xmath5",
    "free boundary conditions are enforced on the other side of the chain .    in order to be able to observe a stationary state in the _ conducting _ regime we need to steadily remove the energy injected in the lattice by the driving force .",
    "thus , we damp a certain number of the rightmost sites ( typically 10% of the total ) by adding a viscous term @xmath6 to their equations of motion . a convenient indicator to look at is the averaged energy flux @xmath7 , where the local flux @xmath8 is given by the following formula  @xcite @xmath9 .   \\label{flux}\\ ] ] time averages of this quantity are taken in order to characterize the insulating ( zero flux)/conducting ( non zero flux ) state of the system .",
    "for illustration , we first discuss the case when the driving frequency is located inside the phonon band .",
    "although trivial , this issue is of importance to better appreciate the fully nonlinear features described later on .    under the effect of the driving ( [ drive ] ) , we can look for extended quasi - harmonic solutions ( nonlinear phonons ) of the form @xmath10 we consider the semi ",
    "infinite chain , so that @xmath11 varies continously between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the nonlinear dispersion relation can be found in the rotating wave approximation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . neglecting higher  order harmonics",
    "( see the appendix for details ) it reads @xmath14 thus the nonlinear phonon frequencies range from 0 to the upper band ",
    "edge @xmath15 .",
    "if we simply assume that only the resonating phonons whose wavenumbers satisfy the condition @xmath16 are excited , we can easily estimate the energy flux .",
    "neglecting , for simplicity , the nonlinear force terms in the definition of the flux ( [ flux ] ) , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the group velocity as derived from dispersion relation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this simple result is in very good agreement with simulations , at least for small enough amplitudes ( see fig .  [ inband ] ) . for @xmath19",
    "the measured flux is larger than the estimate ( [ jphon ] ) , indicating that something more complicated occurs in the bulk ( possibly , a multiphonon transmission ) and that higher - order nonlinear terms must be taken into account .    ,",
    "data have been averaged over @xmath21 periods of the driving .",
    "the inset is an enlargment of the small - amplitude region and the dashed line is the single nonlinear phonon approximation ( [ jphon ] ) . ]",
    "let us now turn to the more interesting case in which the driving frequency lies outside the phonon band , @xmath22 . in a first series of numerical experiments we have initialized the chain at rest and switched on the driving at time @xmath23 . to avoid the formation of sudden shocks  @xcite",
    ", we have chosen to increase smoothly the amplitude from 0 to the constant value @xmath24 at a constant rate , i.e. @xmath25~ , \\label{dr1}\\ ] ] where typically we set @xmath26 .    ,",
    "data have been averaged over @xmath27 periods of the driving for a chain of @xmath28 particles . ]    at variance with the case of in  band forcing , we observe a sharp increase of the flux at a given threshold amplitude of the driving , see fig .",
    "[ outband ] .",
    "this phenomenon has been denoted as _ nonlinear supratransmission _",
    "@xcite to emphasize the role played by nonlinear localized excitations in triggering the energy flux .",
    "this situation should be compared with the one of in ",
    "band driving , shown in fig .",
    "[ inband ] , where no threshold for conduction exists and the flux increases continuously from zero ( more or less quadratically in the amplitude ) .",
    "indeed , the main conclusion that can be drawn from the previous section is that there can not be any amplitude threshold for energy transmission in the case of in - band forcing .",
    "moreover , although at the upper band edge the flux vanishes , since it is proportional to the group velocity ( see formula ( [ jphon ] ) ) , it is straightforward to prove that it goes to zero with the square root of the distance to the band edge frequency .",
    "hence , the sudden jump we observe in the out - band case can not be explained by any sort of quasi - linear approximation .    in the following",
    "we investigate the physical origin of nonlinear supratransmission , distinguishing the cases of small and large amplitudes .",
    "when the driving frequency is only slightly above the band ( @xmath29 ) , one can resort to the continuum envelope approximation . since we expect the zone",

    "( [ nls ] ) corresponds to the family of envelope solitons ( low - amplitude discrete breathers ) @xmath36 } , \\label{sol}\\ ] ] with amplitude @xmath37 .",
    "the maximum of the soliton shape is fixed by the boundary condition to be @xmath38 in this approximation we have two possible solutions : one with the maximum outside the chain , which is purely decaying inside the chain ( minus sign in ( [ x0 ] ) ) , and another with the maximum located within the chain ( plus sign in ( [ x0 ] ) ) . overcoming the supratrasmission threshold corresponds to the disappearence of both solutions .",
    "indeed , when the driving amplitude reaches the critical value @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 solution ( [ sol ] ) ceases to exists .",
    "we have investigated this issue by simulating the lattice dynamics with the initial conditions given by eqs .",
    "( [ sol ] ) and ( [ x0 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the local energy @xmath41\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , is shown in fig .  [ 2brea ] .",
    "the solution with the maximum outside the chain ( upper figure ) stabilizes after the emission of a small amount of radiation ( generated by the fact that we have used an approximate solution ) . on the contrary , the other solution ( lower figure ) slowly moves towards the right and ,",
    "eventually , leaves a localized boundary soliton behind .",
    "the release of energy to the chain is non stationary and does not lead to a conducting state .",
    "the scenario drastically changes at the supratransmission amplitude @xmath39 .",
    "the chain starts to conduct : a train of _ travelling _ envelope solitons is emitted from the left boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ transm ] ) . here",
    "we should emphasize that the envelop soliton solution ( [ sol ] ) , which is characterized by the @xmath30 carrier wave  number , has a zero group velocity .",
    "thus , transmission can not be realized by such envelope solitons . instead ,",
    "transmission starts when the driving frequency resonates with the frequency of the envelope soliton with carrier wave ",
    "number @xmath43 , next to the @xmath44-mode .",
    "however , as far as we consider a large number of oscillators ( @xmath45 ) , we can still use expression ( [ 5 ] ) for the @xmath44-mode frequency .",
    "the above soliton solution is valid in the continuum envelope limit , and is therefore less and less accurate as its amplitude increases . indeed ,",
    "if the weakly nonlinear condition is violated , the width of the envelope soliton becomes comparable with lattice spacing and , thus , one can not use the continuum envelope approach .",
    "fortunately , besides the slowly varying envelope soliton solution ( [ sol ] ) , an analytic approximate expression exists for large amplitude static discrete breather solutions , which is obtained from an exact extended plane wave solution with ",
    "magic \" wave  number @xmath46  @xcite @xmath47\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}n\\pm x_0\\right)~ ,   \\label{breather}\\ ] ] if @xmath48 and @xmath49 otherwise .     below the supratransmission threshold for a driving frequency @xmath50 and a driving amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "one can observe , similarly to the lower fig .",
    "[ 2brea ] , that a moving discrete breather appears at the left boundary and propagates inside the bulk , leaving behind the static solution . ]    here @xmath52 is defined as follows @xmath53 where @xmath24 is the driving amplitude .",

    "as previously for the case of the envelope soliton solution , we perform a numerical experiment where we put initially on the lattice the breather solution of formula ( [ breather ] ) . choosing the plus sign in this expression",
    ", we do not observe any significant transmission of energy inside the chain .",
    "instead , the minus sign causes the appearance of a moving breather , which travels inside the chain leaving behind the static breather solution with plus sign .",
    "[ pppp ] presents this numerical experiment .",
    "the static breather solution ( [ breather ] ) ceases to exist if the driving amplitude exceeds the threshold @xmath39 given by the resonance condition @xmath60 above this threshold the supratransmission process begins via the emission of a train of moving breathers from the boundary , exactly as it happens in the case of small amplitudes .",
    "it should be mentioned again that the transmission regime is established due to moving discrete breathers .",
    "it has been remarked  @xcite that discrete breathers are characterized by quantized velocities , while their frequency is given by the same formula ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "this explains why one can use resonance condition ( [ thre ] ) for the static discrete breather solution ( [ breather ] ) to define the supratransmission threshold in the large amplitude limit .      to check these predictions",
    ", we have performed a numerical determination of @xmath39 for several values of @xmath61 , starting the chain at rest .",
    "this is accomplished by gradually increasing @xmath24 and looking for the minimal value @xmath39 for which a sizeable energy propagates into the bulk of the chain . at early time",
    ", the scenario is qualitatively similar to the one shown in fig.[transm ] .",
    "later on , the interaction of nonlinear and quasi - linear modes and their  scattering \" with the dissipating right boundary establishes a steady energy flux into the chain . a conducting steady state , which is present also below @xmath39 , will be discussed in section v in connection with a lower - transmission threshold @xmath62 .    as seen in fig .",

    "we do nt discuss here the lower curves in fig .",
    "[ raru ] , which are related to the lower - transmission threshold .    for comparison",
    ", we have checked that the supratransmission threshold is definitely not associated with the quasi - harmonic waves with nonlinear dispersion relation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "if this were the case , the transmission should start when the oscillation amplitude reaches the value for which the resonance condition @xmath65 holds .",
    "as @xmath66 is maximal for @xmath30 , we can get the expression for the threshold value from the relation @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 the amplitude values one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) are far away from the numerical values and we do nt even show them in fig .",
    "this is a further confirmation that supratransmission in the fpu model originates from direct discrete breather generation as it happens in the cases of discrete sine - gordon and nonlinear klein - gordon lattices  @xcite .     and",
    "the solid line is a plot of formulae ( [ 6]-[thre ] ) , which are valid for large amplitudes .",

    "[ grad ] the time averaged local energy ( see formula ( [ localenergy ] ) ) reaches asymptotically a given profile : local energy monotonously decreases along the chain as in the case of simulations of stationary heat transport with two thermal baths  @xcite . the time ",
    "average of the flux ( [ flux ] ) in the stationary state is almost constant along the chain , apart from statistical fluctuations and some persistent flux oscillations at the left boundary .",

    "a justification of the presence of the lower - trasmission threshold can be given in terms of quasi - linear theory .",
    "this theory leads to dispersion relation ( [ 2 ] ) only if one restricts to a single right - propagating mode .",

    "this can be justified by taking into account that dispersion relation ( [ dispmin ] ) is valid only in the weakly nonlinear regime , i.e. mode amplitudes @xmath86 and @xmath87 much smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "this condition certainly applies to the case in which the driving frequency is close to the band edge , since , then , the threshold amplitude @xmath62 is small . when the driving frequency is far from the band edge , one has to take into account higher - order corrections .",
    "the inclusion of the first  satellite \" mode ( @xmath89 ) produces a lower threshold amplitude , but the agreement with numerical data extends only to slightly larger amplitudes . to obtain a definitely better agreement , one should treat all satellite modes @xmath90 , @xmath91 , etc .. we briefly discuss this aspect in the appendix .    from the above considerations",
    ", it follows that the bistable nature of the energy flux can be explained making reference to the different excitations of the system . indeed , with the system initially at rest , when following the driving method ( [ dr1 ] ) , extended quasi - harmonic waves can not be excited .",
    "then , energy flow appears only when the driving amplitude reaches the value necessary for localized mode excitation . on the other hand , with driving ( [ dr2 ] ) ,",
    "the energy flow is initiated by the overcoming of the supratransmission threshold and then sustained also by extended quasi - harmonic waves .",

    "<S> we derive approximate analytical estimates of the supratransmission threshold , which are in excellent agreement with numerics . when analysing the long - time behavior , we discover that , below the supratransmission threshold , a _ conducting _ stationary state coexists with the _ insulating _ one . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the _ bistable _ nature of the energy flux in terms of the excitation of quasi - harmonic extended waves . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the analytical calculation of a _ lower - transmission _ threshold which is also in reasonable agreement with numerical experiments . </S>"
