    "one of the major goals of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the understanding of the mechanism of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking  @xcite . in this context , vector - boson fusion ( vbf )",
    "processes form a promising class of reactions : higgs production in vbf , i.e.  the reaction @xmath0 , has been proposed as a particularly clean channel for the discovery of the higgs boson and a later determination of its couplings  @xcite .",
    "an important background to the @xmath1 decay channel ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) in vbf is constituted by continuum @xmath4 production via vbf , i.e.  ew @xmath5 production  @xcite .",
    "the precise knowledge of the standard model cross section for this reaction at nlo - qcd accuracy becomes crucial for distinguishing enhancements in vbf processes due to signatures of new physics , such as strong electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite , from possible effects of higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "we have therefore calculated the nlo - qcd corrections to the reactions @xmath6",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will refer to these processes briefly as `` ew @xmath9 production '' .",
    "our calculations have been turned into fully flexible parton - level monte - carlo programs allowing for the computation of cross sections and distributions within realistic experimental cuts , in complete analogy to the similar programs for the @xmath10 signal  @xcite and @xmath11 production  @xcite via vbf . in this contribution",
    "we briefly recollect the elements of our calculation and discuss the basic features of our results .",
    "the computation of partonic matrix elements for ew @xmath9 production is based on the amplitude techniques of ref .",
    "special emphasis is put on the development of a numerically stable and fast code .",
    "that is achieved by organizing the calculation of the matrix elements in a modular way such that building blocks that are encountered in several diagrams are evaluated only once per phase space point , as described in some detail in refs .",
    "this feature becomes particularly important for the computation of the real emission corrections to @xmath12 production due to the large number of contributing diagrams .",
    "singularities emerging from soft and collinear configurations are regularized in the dimensional - reduction scheme  @xcite with space - time dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the cancellation of the divergences with the respective poles from the virtual contributions is performed by introducing the counter - terms of the dipole subtraction method  @xcite .",
    "the analytical form of the phase - space integrated subtraction terms , obtained after the factorization of the parton distribution functions , is given by [ eq : i ] ( ) = ||^2 c_f ( ) ^(1 + ) + + 9-^2 , in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath14 denoting the amplitude of the corresponding born process and @xmath15 the momentum transfer between the initial and final state quark in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ] .",
    "the computation of the virtual corrections requires the evaluation of self - energy , triangle- , box- , and pentagon contributions on either the upper or the lower quark line , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynborn ]  ( b ) for one representative diagram . contributions from graphs with gluons attached to both the upper and lower quark lines vanish at order @xmath16 . putting all virtual contributions together ,",
    "we find [ eq : virtual_born ] 2 _ v^ * & = & ||^2 c_f @xmath17^(1 + ) + & & --+c_virt+2 _",
    "v^ * , with @xmath18 , and a completely finite remainder @xmath19 .",
    "the divergent pieces in this expression exactly cancel the poles of the counter - terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "the remaining integrals are finite and can be computed numerically in @xmath20 dimensions by means of a passarino - veltman tensor reduction  @xcite .",
    "numerical stability is achieved by the repeated use of ward identities which allow us to express a large fraction of the pentagon contributions by a combination of box - type diagrams .",
    "the cross - section contributions discussed above are implemented in fully flexible parton level monte - carlo programs which allow us to calculate cross sections and kinematical distributions for ew @xmath21 and @xmath22 production at nlo - qcd accuracy within typical experimental acceptance cuts .",
    "we use the cteq6 m parton distributions with @xmath23 at nlo , and the cteq6l1 set at lo  @xcite .",
    "we chose @xmath24  gev , @xmath25  gev and @xmath26gev@xmath27 as electroweak input parameters , from which we obtain @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "jets are reconstructed from final - state partons employing the @xmath30 algorithm  @xcite with resolution parameter  @xmath31 . throughout",
    ", we set fermion masses to zero and neglect external @xmath32- and @xmath33-quark contributions .    in the following , we consider ew @xmath22 production within generic cuts that are relevant for vbf studies at the lhc .",
    "we require at least two hard jets with [ eq : cutspj ] p_tj 20  gev , |y_j| 4.5 , where @xmath34 is the rapidity of the ( massive ) jet momentum which is reconstructed as the four - vector sum of massless partons of pseudorapidity @xmath35 .",
    "the two reconstructed jets of highest transverse momentum are called `` tagging jets '' . to suppress backgrounds to vbf",
    "we impose a large rapidity separation of the two tagging jets , [ eq : cutsyjj ] y_jj=|y_j_1-y_j_2|>4 .",
    "in addition , we require the two tagging jets to reside in opposite detector hemispheres , [ eq : cutsyj ] y_j_1 y_j_2 < 0 , with an invariant mass [ eq : cutsmjj ] m_jj > 600  gev , and adopt the lepton cuts & & p_t 20  gev , |_| 2.5 , r_j 0.4 , + & & m _ 15  gev ,",
    "r _ 0.2 , [ eq : cutspl ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the jet - lepton and lepton - lepton separation in the rapidity - azimuthal angle plane , respectively , and @xmath38 the invariant mass of an @xmath39 or @xmath40 pair .    the total cross section for ew @xmath9 production contains contributions from the higgs resonance with @xmath1 decays , as well as from @xmath4 continuum production . in the following",
    "we will focus on the @xmath4 continuum by imposing a cut on the four - lepton invariant mass [ eq : offres ] m_vv = > m_h+10 , where the @xmath41 denote the four - momenta of the leptons produced in the specific reaction under consideration .    the total continuum cross section for the reaction @xmath42 at nlo within the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cutspj]-[eq : offres ] ) and a higgs mass of @xmath43  gev is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale - dep ]    as a function of the renormalization scale @xmath44 with a fixed factorization scale @xmath45 ( dashed green curve ) , as a function of @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( dot - dashed blue curve ) , and for the case , where both scales are varied simultaneously , @xmath48 ( solid red curve ) .",
    "the lo cross section depends only on @xmath46 ( dotted black curve ) . as in the analogous cases of @xmath49 and @xmath50 production via vbf , discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the scale variations of the nlo prediction are found to be below the 2% level when the scale parameter runs from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , while the lo cross section changes by more than 20% in the same range of @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ptmax_tag ]    shows the transverse momentum distribution of the tagging jet with the highest @xmath54 for ew @xmath55 production .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scales are fixed to @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57  factor , defined by [ eq : kfac ] k(x ) = and shown for this distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptmax_tag ]  ( b ) , illustrates the change in shape when going from lo to nlo . at nlo ,",
    "smaller values of @xmath54 are preferred by the tagging jet , which is due to the extra parton which emerges in the real emission contributions . in a similar way , other distributions such as the invariant mass distribution of the tagging - jet pair , @xmath58  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or the transverse momentum distributions of the detected leptons are affected by the inclusion of nlo corrections . on the other hand , some angular distributions such as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 designates the largest lepton rapidity emerging in the scattering , barely change at nlo as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ylmax ] .",
    "the step in @xmath59 at @xmath61 is due to the rapidity cut imposed on the lepton rapidities in  eq.([eq : cutspl ] ) .    our discussion on the effect which higher order qcd corrections have on dynamical @xmath57  factors has been based on ew @xmath55 production .",
    "however , the shapes of kinematical distributions in the other vbf production processes we have studied , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath6 , behave very similarly .",
    "in this contribution we have reviewed some results on ew @xmath62 and @xmath63 production at nlo - qcd accuracy obtained with fully flexible monte - carlo programs .",
    "the higher order corrections to these reactions turn out to be under excellent control , as indicated by the small scale dependence of the total cross sections and @xmath57  factors close to one .",
    "we found , however , that some kinematical distributions exhibit a noticeable change in shape when nlo corrections are considered .",
    "this indicates the importance of including nlo - qcd contributions in precision studies of vbf processes at the lhc .",
