    "recently , much attention has been focused on uncertainties associated with the parton distributions that are determined in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) global analyses of a wide range of deep inelastic and related scattering data .",
    "there are many sources of uncertainty , but they can be divided into two classes : those which are associated with the _ experimental _ errors on the data that are fitted in the global analysis and those which are due to what can loosely be called _ theory _ errors . in this latter category",
    "we have uncertainties due to ( i )  nnlo and higher - order dglap contributions , ( ii )  effects beyond the standard dglap expansion , such as extra @xmath11 and @xmath12 terms , higher twist and saturation contributions , ( iii )  the particular choice of the parametric form of the starting distributions , ( iv )  heavy target corrections , ( v )  model assumptions , such as @xmath13 . in order to estimate some of these ` theory ' errors , we can also look at the uncertainties arising from different choices of the data cuts ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , defined such that data with values of @xmath0 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 below the cut are excluded from the global fit . this approach indicates where the current theory is struggling to fit the data compared to other regions .    here",
    "we study the uncertainties due to the errors on the data , and leave the discussion of the ` theory ' uncertainties to a second paper .",
    "other groups @xcite@xcite have also concentrated on the experimental errors and have obtained estimates of the uncertainties on parton distributions within a nlo qcd framework , using a variety of competing procedures . of course , the parton distributions are not , themselves , physical quantities .",
    "however , using the standard approach of the linear propagation of errors , these uncertainties of the parton distributions can be translated into uncertainties on observables .",
    "therefore , we first follow the general approach in @xcite and @xcite , the hessian method , and diagonalize the error matrix , parameterizing an increase in @xmath19 of the fit in terms of a quadratic function of the variation of the parameters away from their best fit values .",
    "this gives us a number of sets of partons with variations from the minimum in orthogonal directions which can be used in a simple manner to calculate the uncertainty on any physical quantity .",
    "however , this approach depends for its reliability on the assumption that the quadratic dependence on the variation of the parton parameters is very good .",
    "we find that this approximation , with some modifications of the precise framework , i.e. the elimination of some parameters and rescaling of others , can be made to work well .",
    "we make available 30 sets of partons  2 for each of the 15 eigenvector directions in parton parameter space  which can be used to calculate the uncertainties on any physical quantity .    despite its convenience",
    ", the hessian approach does suffer from some problems if one looks at it in detail , and if one tries to extrapolate results , in particular if we consider large increases in @xmath19 .",
    "it is also not , in principle , the most suitable method when allowing @xmath20 to vary as one of the free parameters in the fit .",
    "hence , in this paper we also investigate the uncertainties on observables directly . in order to do this",
    "we apply the lagrange multiplier method  @xcite to the observables themselves , therefore avoiding some of the approximations involved in the linear propagation of errors from partons to the observables , and confirming that these approximations do not usually cause serious problems . when using this lagrange multiplier approach , the resulting sets of parton distributions , which correspond to the extreme values of each observable , can to a certain extent be thought of as the maximum allowed variation of the dominant contributing partons in the relevant kinematic ( @xmath3 ) domain .",
    "we select observables which are particularly relevant for experiments at present and future colliders , and which illustrate the uncertainties on specific partons in a variety of kinematic ( @xmath3 ) domains . in order to determine the true uncertainty on quantities we also let @xmath6 vary along with the parameters describing the parton distributions directly , which is easy to implement in this approach .",
    "some quantities are then far more sensitive to @xmath6 than others .",
    "fortunately our global fit @xcite produces a value of @xmath6 which is consistent with the world average , with the same type of error , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "hence , it is completely natural to simply let @xmath6 vary as a free parameter in the fit in the same way as all the other parameters when determining uncertainties .",
    "however , we also perform an investigation of the uncertainties with @xmath6 fixed at 0.119 in order to study more directly which variations in the parton distributions are responsible for extreme variations in given physical quantities , and to compare with the results of the hessian approach .    the physical observables that we select as examples in this introductory study are , first , the charged - current structure functions @xmath22 for deep inelastic scattering at high @xmath17 and @xmath18 at hera . these observables almost directly represent the @xmath23 , @xmath24 valence quarks at high @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where deep inelastic data do exist @xcite@xcite , but have errors of @xmath25 or more at present .",
    "the precision on these data is expected to increase dramatically in the near future .",
    "second , we determine the uncertainties on the cross - sections @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for @xmath0 boson production and for the production of a higgs boson of mass domains . ]",
    "@xmath26  gev by gluon fusion respectively , at tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "the cross section @xmath4 is sensitive to the sea quarks ( and also , at the tevatron energy , weakly sensitive to the valence quarks ) in a range of rapidity centered about @xmath27 , and for @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 is sensitive to the gluon distribution in the domain @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    as a third example",
    "we determine the uncertainty on the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath2 production at the lhc energy .",
    "this ratio is expected to be extremely accurately measured in the lhc experiments .",
    "other relevant examples , which we study , are the uncertainties of the moments of the non - singlet ( @xmath24@xmath23 ) quark distributions .",
    "these are quantities for which lattice qcd predictions are becoming available , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the same techniques can be easily and quickly applied to a wide variety of other physical processes sensitive to different partons and different domains . besides giving a direct evaluation of the uncertainties on the observables , we can , in principle , unfold this information to map out the uncertainties on nlo partons over the whole kinematic domain where perturbative qcd is applicable .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss the hessian method , and outline our extraction of different parton distribution sets using this approach .",
    "in particular we highlight the problems encountered , and how they are dealt with in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "we make the sets of partons obtained publicly available . in section  3",
    "we briefly recall the elements of the lagrange multiplier method . in the following four sections we determine the uncertainties of the observables that we have mentioned above .",
    "this will involve a series of global fits in which the observables are constrained at different values in the neighbourhood of their values obtained in the optimum global fit . in each case",
    "we explore , and discuss , the allowed variation of the dominantly contributing partons . using this more rigorous method",
    "we also confirm the general appropriateness of the hessian approach , but discuss where it can start to break down .",
    "finally , in section  8 , we summarize and briefly investigate the uncertainties associated with the initial assumptions made in performing the global fit . in order to do this",
    "we compare the @xmath0 and @xmath31 boson predictions with those obtained using both a slightly updated set of our own partons , mrst2002 , and using the cteq6 partons  @xcite .",
    "( all the results in sections  27 are based on mrst2001 partons  @xcite . )",
    "we find that for the comparison with cteq some of the variations in predictions are surprisingly large .",
    "we also illustrate the same result for the extractions of @xmath6 by various different groups .",
    "this implies that uncertainties involved with initial assumptions and also with theoretical corrections can be more important than those due to errors on the data .",
    "the basic procedure involved in this approach is discussed in detail in @xcite , but we briefly introduce the important points here . in this method",
    "one assumes that the deviation in @xmath19 for the global fit from the minimum value @xmath32 is quadratic in the deviation of the parameters specifying the input parton distributions , @xmath33 , from their values at the minimum , @xmath34 . in this case",
    "we can write @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an element of the hessian matrix , and @xmath37 is the number of free input parameters . in this case",
    "the standard linear propagation of errors allows one to calculate the error on any quantity @xmath38 using the formula @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the covariance , or error matrix of the parameters , and @xmath41 is the allowed variation in @xmath19 .",
    "hence , in principle , once one has either the hessian or covariance matrix ( and a suitable choice of @xmath42 ) one can calculate the error on any quantity .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite , it more convenient and more numerically stable to diagonalize either the hessian or covariance matrix , and work in terms of the eigenvectors .",
    "since the hessian and covariance matrices are symmetric they have a set of orthogonal eigenvectors defined by @xmath43 moreover , because variations in some directions in parameter space lead to deterioration in the quality of the fit far more quickly than others , the eigenvalues @xmath44 span several orders of magnitude .",
    "hence it is helpful to work in terms of the rescaled eigenvectors @xmath45 .",
    "then the parameter displacements from the minimum may be expressed as @xmath46 or using the orthogonality of the eigenvectors @xmath47 i.e. , the @xmath48 are the appropriately normalized combinations of the @xmath49 which define the orthogonal directions in the space of deviation of parton parameters . in practice a @xmath48",
    "is often dominated by a single @xmath49 .",
    "the error determination becomes much simpler in terms of the @xmath48 .",
    "the increase in @xmath19 is @xmath50 i.e. , the surface of constant @xmath19 is a hyper - sphere of given radius in @xmath51-space .",
    "similarly the error on the quantity @xmath38 is now @xmath52^{1/2}. \\label{eq : covariancediag}\\ ] ] thus it is convenient to introduce parton sets @xmath53 for each eigenvector direction , i.e. , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : component ] ) we define @xmath54 where the tolerance @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 and @xmath41 is the allowed deterioration in fit quality for the error determination . then , assuming the quadratic behaviour of @xmath38 about the minimum , ( [ eq : covariancediag ] ) becomes the simple expression @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{2}}. \\label{eq : covdiag}\\ ] ]    if everything were ideal this framework would provide us with a simple and efficient method for calculating the uncertainty due to experimental errors on any quantities , where we would use the standard choice of @xmath58 .",
    "however , the real situation is not so simple , and there are two major complications we must overcome in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "although , in principle , the @xmath59 uncertainty in any cross - section should be given by @xmath60 , the complicated nature of the global fitting procedure , where a large number of independent data sets are used , results in this being an unrealistically small uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "this is undoubtedly due to some failure of the theoretical approximation to work absolutely properly over the full range of data , which introduces the type of theoretical errors outlined in the introduction , and also due to some sources of experimental error not being precisely quantified .",
    "both problems are in practice extremely difficult to surmount",
    ". we shall implicitly ignore the potential theoretical error in this paper , but account for the lack of ideal behaviour in the framework by determining the uncertainties using a larger @xmath41 .",
    "we estimate @xmath61 to be a conservative uncertainty ( perhaps of the order of a @xmath62 confidence level or a little less than @xmath63 ) due to the observation that an increase of 50 in the global @xmath19 , which has a value @xmath64 for @xmath65 data points , usually signifies that the fit to one or more data sets is becoming unacceptably poor .",
    "we find that an increase @xmath42 of 100 normally means that some data sets are very badly described by the theory .",
    "though this estimation does not rely on any real mathematical foundation we do not think it is any less valid than the approaches used in e.g. @xcite or @xcite , both of which ultimately appeal to some value judgment rather than using all available information in a statistically rigorous manner , and ultimately give similar results .",
    "the approaches @xcite do use @xmath60 but either rely on much smaller and more internally compatible data sets , or in some cases have rather small errors .    the second complication is the breakdown of the simple quadratic behaviour in terms of variations of the parameters , i.e. , the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hessian ] ) may receive significant corrections and the simple linear propagation of errors is therefore not accurate .",
    "of course , we expect some deviations from this simple form for very large @xmath41 , but unfortunately very significant deviations can occur for relatively small @xmath66 , as outlined below . due to the very large amount of data in our global fit",
    ", we have a lot of parameters in order to allow sufficient flexibility in the form of the parton distributions .",
    "each of the valence quarks and the total sea quark contribution are parameterized in the form @xmath67 where for the valence quarks the normalization @xmath68 is set by the number of valence quarks of each type .",
    "because we find it necessary to have a negative input gluon at low @xmath17 the gluon parameterization has been extended to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is determined by the momentum sum rule , and @xmath71 can be set to some fixed large value , e.g. 10 or 20 , so that the second term only influences large @xmath17 .",
    "the combination @xmath72 has a slightly different parameterization , i.e. , @xmath73 overall , this gives 24 free parameters . in our standard",
    "fits we allow all these parameters to vary .",
    "however , when investigating in detail the small departures from the global minimum we notice that a certain amount of redundancy in parameters leads to potentially disastrous departures from the behaviour in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hessian ] ) .",
    "for example , in the negative term in the gluon parameterization very small changes in the value of @xmath74 can be compensated almost exactly by a change in @xmath75 and ( to a lesser extent ) in the other gluon parameters over the range of @xmath17 probed , and therefore changes in @xmath74 lead to very small changes in @xmath19 . however , at some point the compensation starts to fail significantly and the @xmath19 increases dramatically .",
    "hence , this certain degree of redundancy between @xmath74 and @xmath75 leads to a severe breaking of the quadratic behaviour in @xmath41 .",
    "essentially the redundancy between the parameters leads to a very flat direction in the eigenvalue space ( a very large / small eigenvalue of the covariance / hessian matrix ) which means that cubic , quartic _ etc_. terms dominate . during the process of diagonalization",
    "this bad behaviour feeds through into the whole set of eigenvectors to a certain extent .",
    "therefore , in order that the hessian method work at all well we have to eliminate the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix , i.e. , remove the redundancy from the input parameters . in order to do this",
    "we simply fix some of the parameters at their best fit values so that the hessian matrix only depends on a subset of parameters that are sufficiently independent that the quadratic approximation is reasonable .",
    "in fact we finish up with 15 free parameters in total  3 for each of the 5 different types of input parton . in particular , fixing the other parameters at the best fit values we find that @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath74 are sufficient for the gluon ",
    "one for high @xmath17 , one for medium @xmath17 and one for low @xmath17 . however , we emphasize that we can not simply set the other parameters to zero .",
    "for example @xmath75 must be of a size as to allow a sufficiently negative input gluon at low @xmath17 with a sensible value of @xmath74 , but we can not allow it to vary simultaneously with @xmath74 .",
    "we could possibly allow one or two more parameters to be free , but judge that the deterioration in the quality of the quadratic approximation does not outweigh the improvements due to increased flexibility in the parton variations .",
    "we note that this problem seems to be a feature of the full global fits obtained by cteq and mrst , and that the other fitting groups have not yet needed to introduce enough parameters to notice such redundancy .",
    "it has clearly been noticed by cteq though , since in @xcite they only have 16 free parameters out of a possible 22 , and in @xcite , where they use a significantly altered type of parameterization , they have only 20 free parameters out of a possible 26 .    hence , we produce 30 sets of parton distributions labeled by @xmath53 to go along with the central best fit ; that is 15 `` + '' sets corresponding to each eigenvector direction , and 15 ``  '' sets , mrst2001c ) are available at http://durpdg.dur.ac.uk/hepdata/mrs@xmath78 . ] .",
    "even though we have limited the number of free parameters in the calculation of the hessian matrix , we note that we still have significant departure from the ideal quadratic behaviour . for the 10 or so lowest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix",
    "the quadratic approximation is very good  the distance needed to go along one of the @xmath48 to produce @xmath79 being the expected @xmath80 to good accuracy in both `` + '' and ``  '' directions .",
    "however , for 4 or 5 of the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix , corresponding mainly to the large-@xmath17 @xmath23 quark , large-@xmath17 gluon and @xmath81 distributions , the absolute scaling and symmetry break down somewhat . in the very worst case of the largest eigenvalue ,",
    "the scale factors to produce @xmath82 are 9.5 and 4.5 in the two opposite directions . in order to produce the sets corresponding to @xmath83 we have to multiply the parton deviations required for @xmath84 by these scale factors rather than the expected 7.07 .",
    "( in fact we do this for all 30 sets , but in most cases the scale factor is in the range 6.57.5 . ) hence , as in @xcite , this necessitates the supply of both `` + '' and ``  ''",
    "sets , whereas in the quadratic approximation one could easily be obtained from the other . indeed from fig .",
    "9 of @xcite it is clear that cteq encounter a breakdown of the quadratic behaviour of much the same type that we do .    using the 30 parton sets @xmath85 corresponding to the 15 eigenvector directions for variations of the partons about the minimum @xmath19",
    ", one can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : covariancediag ] ) to calculate the error for any quantity , assuming an allowed @xmath86 .",
    "in fact it has been proposed @xcite that one may also account for some of the asymmetry due to departures from quadratic behaviour by replacing eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiag ] ) by the slightly more sophisticated form ( f)_+ & = ^ + ( f)_- & = ^ , [ eq : covdiagasymm ] where @xmath87 represents the best fit set of partons . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "examples are discussed where the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiagasymm ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiag ] ) leads to not only an asymmetric error , but also a larger uncertainty overall .",
    "we find only fairly minor effects , with no real evidence that eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiagasymm ] ) leads to markedly more reliable results than eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiag ] ) , so we use the simpler eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiag ] ) in this paper .    as an example of the use of the hessian method we show in figs .",
    "14 the uncertainty on some of the parton distributions at various values of @xmath18 , namely the @xmath88 distribution , the @xmath89 distribution and the gluon distribution respectively .",
    "as one sees , the @xmath88 distribution is very well determined , and the uncertainty shrinks slightly with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the lowest uncertainty is in the region of @xmath90 where there are very accurate data which mainly constrain the valence quarks . at lower @xmath17",
    "the direct constraint is on the sum of valence and sea quarks .",
    "the @xmath89 distribution is also well determined in general , but is rather more uncertain as we go to the highest @xmath17 values .",
    "the gluon distribution is known less well , but at the highest @xmath18 has an uncertainty of as little as @xmath91 for @xmath92 where it is constrained by both @xmath93 of the hera data and the lowest-@xmath94 tevatron jet data .",
    "it becomes very uncertain for @xmath95 where only the relatively imprecise highest-@xmath94 jet data provide any information .",
    "the fractional uncertainty at very small @xmath17 decreases very rapidly as @xmath18 increases because much of the small-@xmath17 gluon at higher @xmath18 is generated from that at higher @xmath17 via evolution .",
    "we also show the gluon at @xmath96 explicitly in fig .  4 .",
    "at this low scale the central gluon is negative at @xmath97 , but we see that the gluon may be positive within the uncertainty .",
    "this just about persists if we go to as low as @xmath98 at this @xmath18 , but at our input scale @xmath99 the gluon would be negative for @xmath17 less than 0.0005 , outside the level of uncertainty chosen . also shown on the plots are the cteq6 m partons . for the @xmath89 distribution",
    "the agreement is excellent . for the @xmath88 distribution",
    "the agreement at @xmath100 is very good , but there is a discrepancy below this value .",
    "however , in this range , the valence quarks become very small indeed and the data only really constrain the total @xmath24 distribution which is completely dominated by the sea . this apparent discrepancy",
    "is probably due to parameterization effects , and is irrelevant in practice .",
    "however , in fig .  3 we see that the mrst and cteq gluons show a genuine and significant level of incompatibility .",
    "we will comment on this more in section  8 .",
    "one might worry that the fixing of some of the parameters , that determine the input parton distributions , will cast some doubt on the error obtained .",
    "however , we stressed that these are largely redundant parameters , and we have checked that the errors obtained ( when using @xmath83 ) are indeed compatible with the errors obtained using more rigorous means , i.e. , the lagrange multiplier method , in the following sections . ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiag ] ) in these comparisons . in all cases",
    "the former only introduced a relatively small asymmetry in the uncertainty , with the average being very close indeed to the result using the latter . also , the asymmetry was of the same sign as that found using the lagrangian approach only half the time , i.e. the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : covdiagasymm ] ) did not reliably predict the direction of steeper increase of @xmath41 , even when the asymmetry was quite large .",
    "we find this surprising , and have no good explanation .",
    "however , it illustrates the semi - qualitative nature of the hessian approach compared to the more rigorous lagrange multiplier method . ] nevertheless , it is a sign of the breakdown of the quadratic approximation .",
    "of more practical concern is the fact that this breakdown is also exhibited in a non - trivial manner in some of the eigenvectors used  particularly those eigenvectors associated with the least known partons , e.g. the high-@xmath17 down quark and gluon .",
    "the scaling has been designed to give correct results if @xmath83 is used .",
    "however , one can not simply extrapolate to different choices of @xmath41 .",
    "for example if @xmath101 were deemed a more suitable choice , in principle the error would just be that using eq .",
    "( [ eq : covariancediag ] ) divided by @xmath102 , but the breakdown of quadratic behaviour does not guarantee this , especially for some directions in parameter space .",
    "also , if one wished to be very conservative in the estimation of an uncertainty , simple extrapolation can not reveal when @xmath66 might start to increase rapidly .",
    "we will see examples of this later .",
    "also we note that we have performed this analysis for a fixed value of the coupling constant : @xmath103 .",
    "one can in principle include this as another free parameter .",
    "indeed we then find that the behaviour obeys the quadratic approximation quite well and that @xmath83 gives an error of about @xmath104 , corresponding well to our error of @xmath105 obtained in @xcite using @xmath106 .",
    "we will discuss extractions of @xmath6 again in section  8 .",
    "however , for the hessian approach there is a slight difference between varying @xmath6 and varying the parton parameters .",
    "when @xmath6 is fixed the maximum error on any quantity is obtained from some linear combination of our different parton sets , and in principle one could reproduce the particular parton set which corresponds to this linear combination , which would be a perfectly well - defined set itself . however , a linear combination of @xmath107 coming from contributions with different @xmath6 does not actually correspond to one particular choice of @xmath6 ( each contribution has a branch point at a different value of @xmath18 , so a linear combination will have multiple branch points ) , so one can not precisely define a particular set of partons corresponding to a particular @xmath6 for the extreme .",
    "hence , although the 30 parton sets obtained using the hessian approach provide the most convenient framework for calculating the uncertainties on a physical observable , for the reasons described above we would also like to study an alternative approach , partially just to check how well our adapted hessian approach really works . a more robust method , which also allows us to directly investigate the partons , and @xmath20 , corresponding to the extreme variations of a given physical quantity is the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "we study this in detail below .",
    "it is much more rigorous to investigate the allowed variation of a specific observable by using the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "this was also one of the approaches used by the cteq collaboration  @xcite . in this , one performs a series of global fits while constraining the values @xmath108 of one , or more , physical quantities in the neighbourhood of their values @xmath109 obtained in the unconstrained global fit . to be precise ,",
    "we minimize the function ( _ i , a )  = _",
    "global^2(a ) + _ i_i_i(a)[eq : psi ] with respect to the usual set @xmath110 of parameters , which specify the parton distributions and the coupling @xmath6 .",
    "this global minimization is repeated for many fixed values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath111 . at the minima , with the lowest @xmath112 ,",
    "the observables have the values @xmath113 and the value of @xmath114 is the minimum for these particular values of @xmath108 .",
    "these optimum parameter sets @xmath115 depend on the fixed values of @xmath111 . clearly , when @xmath116 , we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in this way we are able to explore how the global description of the data deteriorates as the @xmath113 move away from the unconstrained best fit values @xmath109 .",
    "thus by spanning a range of @xmath111 we obtain the @xmath119 profile for a range of values of @xmath108 about the best fit values , @xmath109 . in this study",
    "we take the best fit values corresponding to the mrst2001 partons  @xcite .",
    "this procedure involves none of the approximations involved in the hessian approach .",
    "we can use the full set of parameters in the fit , obtaining maximum flexibility in the partons without having to worry about the large correlations or anticorrelations between some parameters .",
    "we never make any assumption about quadratic dependence on the parameters , and indeed , by using different values of the lagrange multipliers , we can map out precisely how the quadratic approximation breaks down in the uncertainty for any physical quantity .",
    "also , one produces a particular set of partons with a particular value of @xmath6 at every point in the space of cross - sections for the physical quantities mapped , so the interpretation of the extremes is more obvious and natural . hence , in principle , this is a far superior method of obtaining uncertainties to the hessian approach .",
    "however , it suffers from the large practical disadvantage that a series of global fits must be done every time one considers a new quantity . as examples",
    "we investigate a number of interesting physical cases below .",
    "the @xmath42 contour plot for the variation of @xmath121 and @xmath122 about their predicted values from the unconstrained global fit is shown in fig .  5 , where we allow @xmath20 to be a free parameter ( unstarred labels ) or fix it at the best fit value of @xmath103 ( starred labels ) .",
    "we show the contours for @xmath61 ,  100 ,  etc .",
    "overall , the ellipses one would expect from the quadratic approximation for @xmath41 in section  2 are more or less what one sees , but there is a certain asymmetry in that @xmath19 increases rather more rapidly for an increase in both @xmath123 and @xmath122 than for a corresponding decrease in both .",
    "thus , from fig .  5 , we see that the uncertainties of the @xmath124 and @xmath122 structure functions at @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( due to the experimental errors on the data in the global fit ) are about % and @xmath127 respectively . in comparison ,",
    "the values using the hessian approach are @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively , in good agreement , although slightly smaller for @xmath124 . at this value of @xmath17 the uncertainties in @xmath124 and",
    "@xmath122 have a particularly simple interpretation since @xmath124 is almost exactly proportional to the valence down quark distribution , @xmath89 , and @xmath122 is almost exactly proportional to the @xmath88 distribution .",
    "this can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "6 , which shows the @xmath24 and @xmath23 distributions for the extreme sets ( t*,u*,v * and w * ) corresponding to maximum and minimum @xmath124 and @xmath122 ( for the case of fixed @xmath6 ) .",
    "rather obviously the @xmath23 distribution maximises at large @xmath17 for the case of maximum @xmath124 and minimises for minimum @xmath124 , with similar behaviour for the @xmath24 distribution and @xmath122 .",
    "note however that in each case the extreme in the parton distribution is not precisely at @xmath125 , but at slightly higher @xmath17 , where the data are less constraining .",
    "there are also sum rules on the partons which must be satisfied .",
    "it is also clear that there is a strong inverse correlation between the @xmath24 and @xmath23 distributions .",
    "this is because the data which constrain the relevant partons are the structure function measurements @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 which are essentially proportional to @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath134 respectively , where @xmath135 at @xmath125 .",
    "this constrains @xmath24 far more than @xmath23 as we have seen , but means that for maximum variation in the partons a change in @xmath24 must be compensated by a much larger opposite change in @xmath23 .",
    "the result that the major axis of the ellipse for given change in @xmath66 is approximately aligned along @xmath136 ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) is therefore not at all surprising .",
    "the rate of quickest increase in @xmath19 is then along @xmath138 , where the changes in the partons add in such a way as to maximise changes in the measured structure functions .",
    "we see that allowing @xmath6 to also vary allows the error ellipses to grow slightly , mainly in width . now",
    "the maximum and minimum allowed values of @xmath122 ( or @xmath24 ) correspond to @xmath139 and @xmath140 and to parton sets t and v respectively .",
    "most of the constraining data are for @xmath141 , and must be well fit , but smaller @xmath20 means slower evolution of the quarks and thus greater values of @xmath24 and @xmath122 at @xmath126 .",
    "opposite considerations lead to the maximum @xmath122 .",
    "since the extrema of @xmath124 and @xmath23 are more involved , due to the negative correlation with the @xmath24 distribution , they are less altered by allowing @xmath20 to vary ; see sets u and w. we see that the axes of the ellipse are essentially unchanged when @xmath20 is left free . thus fig .",
    "6 is much the same except that the variations for parton sets t and v are a little greater than for t@xmath142 and v@xmath142 .",
    "it is , of course , the fixed target data which constrain these cross - sections and the high-@xmath17 quarks .",
    "it is very largely the bcdms @xmath143 measurements which are responsible for the upper extremum in @xmath124 .",
    "the best fit tends to overshoot these data in the region of @xmath125 , and a large increase in @xmath23 makes the fit to these measurements very poor . for the extrema in @xmath122 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the deterioration is more evenly spread over pretty much all the fixed target data at @xmath144 ( with the exception that the description of the bcdms @xmath145 measurements improves slightly ) , but the cumulative result is a very poor fit .",
    "one of the worst instances of deterioration is for the nmc @xmath146 ratio .",
    "the @xmath42 contour plot for the variation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 about their predicted values at the lhc energy from the unconstrained global fit is shown in fig .  7 , where again we allow @xmath20 to be a free parameter or fix it at @xmath103 .",
    "again we show the contours for @xmath61 ,  100 ,  etc .",
    "this time the hessian approach should work well , although the ellipses start becoming a little rectangular . allowing @xmath6",
    "to vary , we see that the uncertainties of the @xmath0 and @xmath31 cross - sections at the lhc ( due to the experimental errors on the data in the global fit ) are about % and @xmath147 respectively , and are positively correlated .",
    "again this analysis also gives information on the uncertainties of particular parton distributions . to be specific ,",
    "the parton sets which correspond to the points a , b , c , d , on the @xmath61 contour in fig .  7 , give the uncertainties in the parton distributions that dominantly determine @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the kinematic domain @xmath148 , @xmath149  gev@xmath150 relevant to @xmath0 and @xmath31 production at the lhc . the extrema in @xmath4 , represented by a and c , correspond to variations in the sea quark distributions , while the extrema in @xmath5 , represented by b and d , correspond to variations in the gluon distribution _ and _ @xmath6 .",
    "the values of @xmath20 for sets a and c are 0.119 and 0.118 respectively , both very close to the default mrst2001 value , showing that @xmath4 , which begins at zeroth order , is insensitive to @xmath20 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath20 for fits b and d are 0.120 and 0.117 respectively , reflecting the fact that @xmath151 .",
    "this is well illustrated by repeating the entire analysis with @xmath20 fixed at the default value ( 0.119 ) obtained in the unconstrained global fit @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 and 100 contours for this additional analysis are shown by the smaller shapes in fig",
    "we can see that the uncertainty on @xmath4 is almost unchanged , while that for @xmath5 is reduced to about @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding values using the hessian approach are @xmath152 and @xmath152 , in good agreement but slightly smaller in each case .    the up quark distribution for each ` extrema ' set with fixed @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) and the gluon distribution in fig .",
    "we see that indeed the parton distributions do reflect the extrema in the cross - sections in a fairly simple manner .",
    "the quark densities at high @xmath17 show almost no variation between fits since they are well constrained at high @xmath17 and because the @xmath0 and @xmath31 production cross - sections are sensitive to the partons at an @xmath17 range centered at a few @xmath153 .",
    "indeed the maximum and minimum @xmath0 cross - sections correspond to the maximum and minimum sea quarks for @xmath154 at @xmath155 .",
    "the maximum and minimum higgs cross - sections correspond to the maximum and minimum gluon distributions in the same sort of range , although the large @xmath17 gluon must now decrease for increases in the small @xmath17 partons , and _",
    "vice versa _ , in order to maintain the momentum sum rule .",
    "the strong correlation between the two cross - sections is due to the fact that at high @xmath18 the size of the quark distribution at small @xmath17 is mainly determined by evolution , and the larger the small @xmath17 gluon the stronger the quark evolution ( and _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "when @xmath20 is left free the resulting partons at the extrema are similar to the fixed @xmath20 results . however , in this case , their variation is a little larger at smaller @xmath18 , since the slight changes in @xmath20 lead to different rates of evolution .    for the case of fixed @xmath20",
    "the main contributions to @xmath66 come from the hera small-@xmath17 structure function data and , because of the changes in the high @xmath17 gluon , also from the tevatron jet data .",
    "for the upper extrema in @xmath4 and @xmath5 the slope @xmath93 tends to be too large for @xmath156 , while for the lower extrema the slope is too small . in both cases",
    "the fit to jet data deteriorates due to the shape of the high-@xmath17 gluon becoming wrong .",
    "when @xmath6 is allowed to vary the data which are particularly sensitive to this also play a role , for example the bcdms data are fitted less well when @xmath157 in fit b , and the nmc data are described less well when @xmath139 in fit  d.    the corresponding @xmath42 contour plot for the tevatron is shown in fig .  9 , where again we either allow @xmath20 to be a free parameter or fix it at @xmath103 .",
    "we see that the uncertainty of the @xmath0 cross - section at the tevatron ( due to the experimental errors on the data in the global fit ) has decreased to about @xmath158 while that for the higgs has increased to about @xmath159% for varying @xmath6 , and that the correlation has disappeared . for @xmath6",
    "fixed at 0.119 @xmath4 is again largely unaffected , but the uncertainty of @xmath5 now more than halves to about % , reflecting the fact that this time the maximum and minimum higgs cross - sections for variable @xmath20 correspond to @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively . with",
    "@xmath6 fixed there is now even a very slight anti - correlation between the cross - sections .",
    "the extrema in @xmath4 , represented by p and r , correspond roughly to variations in the quark distributions at @xmath162 , while the extrema in @xmath5 , represented by q and s , correspond to variations in the gluon distribution at @xmath163 _ and _ @xmath6 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 sampled at the tevatron are an order of magnitude greater than at the lhc .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that it is a proton  antiproton collider , rather than a proton ",
    "proton collider , complicates the interpretation of the extremes of the cross - sections in terms of partons .    the up quark distribution for each extrema set with fixed @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) and the gluon distribution in fig .",
    "the corresponding distributions obtained when @xmath6 is allowed to vary are shown in fig .",
    "we first consider the cases of the maximum and minimum @xmath0 cross - sections , which are insensitive to whether @xmath20 is left to vary or not .",
    "for discussion purposes , let us consider only the @xmath24 and @xmath23 quark flavour contributions .",
    "then the @xmath0 cross - section is roughly proportional to u(x_1)d(x_2 ) + d(x_1)u(x_2 ) + |u(x_1)|d(x_2 ) + |d(x_1 )    @xmath164 .",
    "hence the average value of @xmath165 .",
    "this is sufficiently large that there is a distinct difference between the quark and antiquark distributions , and the contribution to the cross - section from the quark contribution is the greater .",
    "hence , one can decrease the cross - section by replacing a quark by its antiquark at @xmath166 , or _",
    "vice versa_. of course , there is a fundamental constraint in doing this due to the sum rule for each valence quark .",
    "however , the only real experimental constraint is from the ccfr @xmath167 data , all other structure function data being insensitive to the distinction between quark and antiquark . in the optimum global fit",
    "most data would like there to be more quarks at high @xmath17 , while the ccfr @xmath167 data would prefer more valence quarks at @xmath168 .",
    "this leads to a compromise where for the best fit the ccfr @xmath167 data at low @xmath17 are undershot .",
    "the minimum @xmath4 is therefore achieved mainly by this exchange of quark for antiquark , which most data are happy with , and hence the deterioration in @xmath19 at p ( and p@xmath142 ) is almost entirely from the description of the ccfr @xmath167 data .",
    "hence , both the gluon and quark distribution for p ( and p@xmath142 ) are hardly changed , as seen in figs .",
    "10 and 11 , but @xmath169 and @xmath170 decrease for @xmath92 .",
    "going in the other direction , an increase in @xmath171 and the consequent decrease in the valence quarks at higher @xmath17 causes a large penalty in @xmath19 and the maximum @xmath4 is achieved in a different manner . at @xmath172",
    "the quark evolves much more slowly than at @xmath172 and the density at @xmath173 is determined largely by the input value , and modified by the rate of evolution .",
    "hence the maximum @xmath4 is achieved by having a large quark distribution at @xmath172 at low @xmath18 and also by having an enhanced gluon at @xmath92 to increase evolution .",
    "these are displayed in figs .",
    "10 and 11 .",
    "the deterioration in @xmath19 then comes mostly from the low @xmath18 quarks causing an overshooting of nmc structure function data , but there is also a contribution due to the enhanced gluon at @xmath174 causing it to be smaller for @xmath175 and hence fitting the tevatron jet data less well .",
    "the extrema of the higgs cross - section are also slightly complicated .",
    "it is not possible to simply increase or decrease the gluon in a range centered on @xmath172 because this is precisely the @xmath17 region where the majority of the gluon s momentum is carried , and this total is very well constrained by the momentum sum rule and the accurate high @xmath17 quark determination .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath6 the change in @xmath5 is largely reliant on the fact that this total cross - section actually probes quarks within about an order of magnitude either side of the central production value of @xmath176 . hence , as we see from fig .",
    "10 the maximum cross - section is obtained from the gluon in set q@xmath142 which is slightly reduced for @xmath177 and more enhanced for @xmath178 and the minimum cross - section is obtained from the gluon in set s@xmath142 which is slightly increased for @xmath177 and more reduced for @xmath178 . in both cases those data sets sensitive to the small @xmath17 and large @xmath17 gluon , i.e. , hera structure function data and tevatron jet data respectively , are those for which the description deteriorates .",
    "when @xmath6 is allowed to go free it varies by about @xmath104 and there is a large increase in the variation of @xmath5 .",
    "this is not only because @xmath179 but also because the hera data anti - correlate @xmath20 and the small @xmath17 gluon .",
    "therefore , in set q , for example , the increased value of @xmath6 allows the small @xmath17 gluon to get much smaller , and the high @xmath17 gluon much larger , compared to set q@xmath142 .",
    "this compensation between @xmath20 and the small @xmath17 gluon also means that hera data remains well fit , and it is the jet data ( particularly cdf ) , sensitive to large @xmath17 , and the large @xmath20-phobic bcdms data , for which the description deteriorates .",
    "similar considerations apply to set s as compared to s@xmath142 . here",
    "it is the d0 jet data and the small @xmath20-phobic slac and nmc data that are badly fit .    for @xmath83",
    "the hessian approach gives an uncertainty of @xmath180 for @xmath4 and @xmath147 for @xmath5 , at the tevatron energy .",
    "in simplistic terms this is in good agreement , but a little smaller for the gluon - sensitive higgs cross - section . however , in this case we see from fig .",
    "9 a very marked asymmetry on the contour plot . for fixed @xmath6 the ellipses",
    "are certainly not centered on the best fit values , and for varying @xmath6 we see that @xmath19 is clearly increasing far more rapidly for increases in the predicted @xmath0 cross - section than for corresponding decreases . thus , it is clear that within the framework of this fit , increases of the cross - section of much more than @xmath181 are completely ruled out , whereas decreases of the same amount are much more acceptable .",
    "this information would be largely lost in the hessian approach , and for these quantities the lagrange multiplier method does supply some important additional information .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 production cross - sections at hadron colliders is a particularly interesting observable .",
    "the measurement is expected to be quite precise ( better than @xmath182 at the lhc , see e.g.  @xcite ) , since many of the experimental uncertainties cancel in the ratio .",
    "the uncertainty in the prediction of the ratio at the lhc can be deduced from the @xmath42 profile shown in fig .",
    "taking , as before , the @xmath183 measure , we obtain @xmath184 , and the hessian approach is in very good agreement with this .",
    "since the @xmath185 ratio is sensitive to the ratio of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quark distributions , it is not surprising that the increase in @xmath19 is almost entirely due to the nmc @xmath146 data  @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the @xmath185 ratio may be found in ref .",
    "consider , for instance , the ratio as a function of the @xmath0 rapidity @xmath186 [ eq : ratio_func_y ]  , where @xmath187 at the lhc . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio_func_y ] ) we have ignored , for simplicity , the contributions involving strange and heavier quarks .",
    "thus a measurement of the ratio at large @xmath186 would provide a direct determination of @xmath188 at large @xmath17 .",
    "for example , for @xmath189 , we measure @xmath188 at @xmath190 at the lhc . of course",
    ", it is the decay lepton rapidity that is measured , rather than the parent @xmath0 rapidity , and so the ratio in a given rapidity bin will have a greater uncertainty than that for @xmath191 .",
    "the parton distribution functions of the nucleon are fundamental quantities that should , in principle , be calculable from first principles in qcd . in particular",
    ", the @xmath17 _ moments _ of parton distributions at a given scale @xmath18 are related , by the operator product expansion , to a product of perturbatively calculable wilson coefficients and non - perturbative matrix elements of quark and gluon operators .",
    "the latter can be computed using lattice qcd and , indeed , in recent years the precision of the lattice calculations has improved significantly .",
    "although in principle the lattice results can be related to moments of physical structure functions , in practice it is more efficient to use parton distributions determined in a global fit to represent the physical ` data ' .",
    "comparisons of recent lattice moment calculations with the predictions of earlier mrs parton distributions are encouraging , see for example @xcite .    in order to quantify the agreement between the lattice calculations and the parton distribution predictions",
    "it is obviously important to know the uncertainties in the latter .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the lagrange multiplier method used in previous sections to determine the uncertainties in observable cross - sections to the moments of parton distributions .    to avoid contamination from gluon contributions ,",
    "the lattice calculations focus on the moments of non - singlet quark operators .",
    "for example , lattice results are available for the first three moments of the combination @xmath192 , i.e. , [ eq : m_n ] m_n^u - d(q^2 ) = _ 0 ^ 1 dx x^n-1 [ u(x , q^2)-d(x , q^2 ) ] with @xmath193 .",
    "the predictions of the mrst2001 set ( at @xmath194 ) for these moments are given in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath41 contour plot for the ( percentage ) variation of the second and third moments about their predicted values is shown in fig .  13 .",
    "we again show the @xmath195 and @xmath196 contours corresponding to the fixed @xmath20 analysis , but there is evidently little difference between the fixed and variable coupling results in this case .",
    "as expected , there is a strong positive correlation between the two moments . using the @xmath195 , varying @xmath20 criterion for defining a conservative error , we obtain errors of @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 for the second , third and fourth moments respectively .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the errors on the moments are also given in table  1 .",
    "the increasing relative error with increasing moment is to be expected  higher moments probe the @xmath200 region where there are fewer dis structure function data .",
    "again we notice that there is a small asymmetry in the contours  the increase in @xmath19 when both moments increase being less severe than when both moments decrease .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]      we also find a large variation in the values of @xmath6 extracted from the fits of the different collaborations : cteq6  @xcite , zeus  @xcite , mrst2001  @xcite , h1  @xcite , alekhin  @xcite and giele et  al .",
    "( gkk )  @xcite .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath6 are listed in table  2 , together with the determination of this work ( mrst2002 ) , in order of decreasing tolerance ( @xmath202 ) , which is reflected in the size of the corresponding experimental error .",
    "not all are presented as determinations of @xmath6 , but all are extracted using the same criteria as for the uncertainty on partons in the respective fit , and hence should be as reliable .",
    "clearly there is a very large variation , with some very low values .",
    "the uncertainties due to experimental errors are determined in different fashions in each case , and a summary can be found in @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath203 for the zeus determination  @xcite , because they use the offset method for determining uncertainties which for @xmath84 gives a larger uncertainty than the more common hessian method .",
    "zeus estimate that this is equivalent to @xmath204 if they were to use the same treatment of errors as cteq .",
    "we also use @xmath203 for the gkk value @xcite , because the uncertainties are obtained using confidence limits , but the error quoted corresponds to the one sigma usually associated with @xmath58 .",
    "the model errors incorporate such effects as the heavy quark prescription and masses , parameterizations , changes in the starting scale of evolution _ etc_. the theory error is often determined by variation of renormalization and factorization scales , though mrst use an estimate appealing to current knowledge of nnlo and resummations , which we feel is more reliable .",
    "since each fit is centered on nlo qcd with scales equal to @xmath18 , the `` theory errors '' are very strongly correlated , and can not therefore be responsible for the differences .",
    "these discrepancies are undoubtedly due to the assumptions going into the fits , mainly on which data sets are included and which cuts on @xmath18 and @xmath205 are used .",
    "mrst , who obtain the largest value of @xmath6 , use the widest range of data sets and also the least conservative cuts . as compared to mrst2001  @xcite , as seen in table  2",
    ". we still use @xmath106 for our one - sigma uncertainty , since if @xmath83 corresponds to 90% confidence level , or 1.65 sigma , simple scaling implies that one sigma corresponds to @xmath206 , i.e. @xmath106 to a good approximation . ]",
    "cteq use only a slightly smaller number of data sets but also cut data below @xmath201 , as described previously .",
    "they also use a definition of the nlo coupling which truncates the solution of the renormalization group equation , whereas most other groups use the full solution of the nlo equation . both approaches are equally correct , but the truncation of the solution leads to a slightly higher value of @xmath107 at scales below @xmath207 , for the same value of @xmath6 , than the other method , and thus tends to yield a lower @xmath6 .",
    "cteq also have a very conservative estimate of the error , though it is meant to be somewhat more than a one - sigma error .",
    "zeus and alekhin use a similar selection of data sets , i.e. , hera dis data ( only zeus data in the former case ) and a number of fixed target dis data sets .",
    "hence , it is unsurprising that they obtain similar central values of @xmath6 , with respective errors which are easily explained by their choices of @xmath41 .",
    "h1 and gkk both use a small number of sets of data : the former collaboration uses h1 dis data @xcite and bcdms fixed - target proton dis data @xcite , while gkk use older h1 dis data @xcite together with bcdms and e665 @xcite fixed - target proton dis data .",
    "both determinations are heavily influenced by the bcdms proton data set which prefers rather small from bcdms data alone  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath6 , and this feeds into the final values .",
    "also , both are strict in their statistical interpretation , obtaining small uncertainties , even with relatively small data samples .",
    "finally we note that only cteq and mrst include the tevatron jet data in their analyses .",
    "this is relevant because of the @xmath20gluon correlation .",
    "from the discussion of the previous two subsections , it is clear that different ideas about the best way to perform a nlo fit can lead to a wide variation in both the central values and the errors of @xmath6 as well as in predictions for physical quantities such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the fact that the various ` nlo ' fits can yield such different outputs is disturbing , and is indicative of the uncertainty arising from theoretical assumptions .",
    "indeed , we have always believed that ` theory ' , rather than experiment , will provide the dominant source of error @xcite .",
    "we have already produced approximate nnlo parton distributions and predictions @xcite ( based on the approximate splitting functions @xcite obtained from the known nnlo moments @xcite ) , and find , for example , that the nnlo @xmath0 cross - section at the tevatron is @xmath208 higher than at nlo , and believe that this result is reliable .",
    "this change is somewhat larger than the uncertainty due to experimental errors shown in fig .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 production is likely to be subject to smaller theoretical uncertainty than many other observables  particularly those directly related to the gluon .",
    "our estimates for the uncertainty in @xmath209 at small @xmath17 are @xmath210 or more even at @xmath126 , and significantly larger at lower @xmath18 , for example .",
