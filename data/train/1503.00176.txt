    "the tendency for populations of oscillators to synchronize their dynamics and produce large - scale collective oscillations is relevant in a wide range of contexts @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple class of models for this behavior was proposed by kuramoto , where each oscillator in a network is described by a phase variable , which has a tendency to oscillate at its natural frequency and in phase with its neighbors @xcite .",
    "this model has given insights into the dynamics of many systems , from the synchronization of coupled chemical oscillators and josephson junction arrays , to correlations in visual cortex experiments and coherence in neutrino flavor oscillations @xcite .",
    "much recent work on the kuramoto model has concerned synchronization on complex networks , where the transition to coherent oscillations depends on the properties of the network topology @xcite .",
    "some important results are vanishing synchronization thresholds and explosive transitions for networks with large degree fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of external driving are much less known , and questions about how different networks of oscillators respond to driving , and to what extent they can be controlled , have not been answered , even though in many circumstances , external fields are present @xcite .",
    "an important example is the network of pacemaker cells , which play a role in determining mammalian circadian rhythms , and can be driven by light - dark cycles @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we discuss the _ interplay between mutual and driven synchronization _ in random networks of phase oscillators with a given degree distribution .",
    "in particular , we present key aspects of the stability diagram for the driven kuramoto model on these networks , focusing on the appearance of a codimension - three takens - bogdanov - cusp singularity in the parameter region where the coupling strength between oscillators is weak . this bifurcation description is used to explain various pathways to driven and mutual synchronization in terms of synchronized oscillator clusters and network topology .",
    "kuramoto showed that a system of limit cycle oscillators , each near their own hopf bifurcation , with weak coupling to their neighbors and fast amplitude equilibration , have the following simple equations of motion : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the phase of the @xmath2th oscillator , with natural frequency @xmath3 , coupling strength @xmath4 , and adjacency matrix for the interaction network @xmath5 . under generic circumstances ( e.g. , when the natural frequencies are randomly assigned according to a symmetric and unimodal distribution without correlations to the topology ) , this system undergoes a critical transition from incoherence to mutual synchronization once the coupling strength exceeds a threshold , resulting in a fraction of the network oscillating at the average of the natural frequencies , and with a stationary phase distribution @xcite .",
    "a simple extension of the kuramoto model that includes a periodic driving force is given by @xcite : @xmath6 with external field strength @xmath7 and frequency @xmath8 .",
    "with similar assumptions for the natural frequency distribution , we expect each term to have the following effects on the dynamics : the randomness in the frequencies causes oscillators to have disperse phases with monotonic build - up in time , the coupling tends to align the phases of neighbors in proportion to the number of connections in a local environment ( which will vary across the network ) , and the driving field tends to force oscillators to move at the driving frequency and away from its natural frequency .",
    "the interactions among these tendencies , both cooperative and competitive , will depend on the magnitude of each term and the network topology , and therefore we expect an intricate dynamics with multiple behaviors and transitions @xcite .",
    "to clarify the dynamics , we attempt to find a reduced description of . for convenience ,",

    "this is the fundamental equation for the thermodynamic limit of the forced kuramoto model on annealed networks .",
    "the dynamics has been reduced to a description of the average contribution to the order parameter by nodes of degree @xmath12 , with the size of the state - space equal to twice the number of degree classes . in the following",
    ", we will focus on networks that have power - law degree distributions with finite cutoffs and poisson distributions , @xmath47    respectively , though analytic results are given for arbitrary distributions . we will refer to the former as simply `` power - law '' for brevity , though the degree cutoff , @xmath48 , will be specified when pertinent . in general",
    ", the cutoff determines the dimensionality of the reduced system , and we find that its value is relevant for heterogeneous network behavior , where large degree nodes can contribute significantly to the dynamics .",
    "first , we consider the states of mutual and driven synchronization in instructive limits .",
    "for instance , in the limit where @xmath49 , eq . describes an un - driven network , and has stable solutions corresponding to oscillating waves : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52-r_{k},\\ ] ] which reproduces known results @xcite . in particular for the frame where @xmath53 , the network tends to a purely oscillating state at the average natural frequency @xmath37 , with some fixed @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , the incoherent state , @xmath55 , has a linear stability exponent @xmath56 which implies a threshold for the onset of mutual synchronization in the absence of driving , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "we consider situations where @xmath59 , and a coherent mutually synchronized state is stable without forcing @xcite .    on the other hand , in the limit where the driving frequency is equal to the average natural frequency , @xmath60 , eq . describes states of driven synchronization , where the network is oscillating at the driving frequency on average , with amplitudes given by the fixed points of the self - consistent equation : @xmath61 and with a large number of nodes entrained to the driving . from we",
    "can see that incoherence is not a solution when @xmath62 , meaning that external driving always enforces some level of coherent oscillations at its frequency .",
    "moreover , multiple coherent solutions can exist depending on the parameter values .",
    "next , we provide the results of a stability and partial@xcite bifurcation analysis that delineates the boundaries between the limiting states and helps to explain how each can be converted into the other .",
    "the associated stability diagrams are somewhat complicated , and it is therefore useful to have the results in hand before proceeding to fill in the details",
    ". a quantitative discussion and analysis can be found in sec.[sec : bifurcationanalysis ] that derives some of the results , with a broader summary of behaviors found in sec.[sec : keytransitions ] .",
    "+    the schematic stability diagrams shown in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] illustrate two types of behavior in the @xmath63 plane when the coupling , @xmath64 , is weak ( sec.[sec : bifurcationanalysis ] ) .",
    "if we consider networks with power - law degree distributions , fig.[fig : bifurcation](a ) shows the generic behavior when the degree exponent , @xmath65 , is large .",
    "we find that this is maintained for networks with relatively homogeneous degree distributions , such as erds rnyi , k - regular , or complete graphs @xcite .",
    "conversely when the degree exponent is small , i.e. , the degree distribution has a heavy tail , the behavior looks like fig.[fig : bifurcation](b ) .",
    "because the former reproduces the behavior for the complete graph , and the latter occurs as the amount of variation in the degree distribution is increased , we distinguish these cases by the terms homogeneous and heterogeneous driven behavior .    in particular , we find that the takens - bogdanov point appears on the upper branch of the saddle - node bifurcations for the homogeneous case , but appears on the lower branch for the heterogenous case , as depicted in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] .",
    "the transition between the two behaviors can occur , for example , by decreasing the degree exponent , for some fixed @xmath64 and @xmath48 , until the takens - bogdanov and cusp bifurcations are coincident , which typically occurs for some @xmath66 ( see sec.[sec : bifurcationanalysis ] for descriptions of these bifurcations ) .",
    "the existence of this singularity allows us to construct the behaviors shown through a combination of analytic results , numerical continuation , and general predictions for subsequent bifurcations .",
    "details are given in the following sections , and example stability diagrams are shown alongside schematics in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] .",
    "we begin constructing the stability digrams by first finding the fixed points of eq . , which denote states of driven synchronization , and establish how such states change stability . in general , fixed points satisfy @xmath67 , which implies the self - consistent condition for @xmath68 : @xmath69    each @xmath70 is a complex number , and so could be represented by a magnitude and phase , or with real and imaginary parts .",
    "next , it is useful to consider how the dynamics respond to perturbations away from the steady - states given by , e.g. @xmath71+x_{k}$ ] and @xmath72+y_{k}$ ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the @xmath12th components of the right eigenvectors of at @xmath75 , in the real and imaginary part representation of @xmath70 .",

    "it is more convenient to use the latter and leave eq . in its complex form , while keeping in mind that the standard results of bifurcation theory pertain to some underlying real representation of .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next , we catalogue relevant bifurcations found in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] , and discuss their dynamical behaviors in sec . [",
    "sec : keytransitions ] .",
    "first , the spectrum condition can be used to find the local codimension - one bifurcations , where some number of eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis ( codimension implying the number of parameters that must be changed in order for a bifurcation to occur ) @xcite .",
    "the most generic such crossing is the saddle - node bifurcation ( @xmath92 ) , in which the spectrum at the equilibrium has one simple zero eigenvalue , and at which two equilibrium points collide and disappear : @xmath93\\right|^2 = 1.\\ ] ] the @xmath92 condition predicts when steady states of driven synchronization vanish , and signifies when a local barrier ( represented by the saddle ) in the dynamics has been overcome .",
    "importantly , we find that the lower branch of @xmath92 bifurcations contains a section of saddle - node - infinite - period bifurcations ( @xmath94 ) ( e.g. , crossing v - iii in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] ) , where an @xmath92 occurs on a limit cycle of infinite period @xcite .",
    "another local codimension - one bifurcation is the hopf ( @xmath95 ) , in which the spectrum at the equilibrium has two purely imaginary eigenvalues , with all others having non - zero real parts .",
    "at this point the amplitude of a periodic orbit decreases continuously to zero with its period tending to @xmath96 , where @xmath97 : @xmath98   \\biggr [    \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{k}\\frac{\\mathcal{j}k^{2}p_{k}\\bar{a}_{k}^{\\boldmath{*}^\\mathlarger{2}}}{2\\left < k\\right>(i\\omega_{h}+\\bar{q}^{*}_{k})}}{\\sum\\limits_{k}\\frac{\\mathcal{j}k^{2}p_{k}}{2\\left < k\\right>(i\\omega_{h}+\\bar{q}^{*}_{k } ) } -1 } \\biggr ]   = 1.\\ ] ] when the periodic orbit associated with the hopf bifurcation is stable , it is called supercritical ( @xmath99 ) , and when it is unstable , it is called subcritical @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "in contrast with homogenous network behavior ( e.g. , crossing @xmath101 in fig.[fig : bifurcation](a))@xmath102 @xcite , both branches of cycle - stability can appear if the degree distribution is broad enough ( e.g. , crossing @xmath103 in fig.[fig : bifurcation](b ) ) .    beyond the local codimension - one bifurcations ,",
    "there are two key local codimension - two bifurcations .",
    "these are important to unravel because they can inform us as to what global bifurcations occur .",
    "the first appears when two branches of the @xmath92 collide , in the neighborhood of which there exist three states of driven entrainment ; this is known as a cusp @xmath104 @xcite . to find the @xmath105 point",
    ", we first consider that near a bifurcation , the equations of motion can be restricted to a center manifold with the same dimension as the number of eigenvectors whose eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis , and is tangent to those vectors .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of the center manifold are equivalent to the normal form for the bifurcation . in the simple case of a @xmath92 ,",
    "the center manifold is one - dimensional , @xmath106 with the normal form : @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath105 bifurcation occurs when @xmath108 , a condition for which can be found by substituting the center manifold expansion and normal form into , collecting terms of order @xmath109 , and taking the complex inner product of the resulting vector , @xmath110 , with the left eigenvectors , @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the right and left eigenvectors are found from a similar self - consistent analysis as for , and in the complex representation are respectively : @xmath112 with constants @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and with the conveniently defined sum , @xmath115.\\ ] ] collecting terms of order @xmath109 in the expansion produces the bilinear form for evaluated at the vector @xmath116 : @xmath117 putting these together generates the normal form coefficient @xmath118 , and a condition for the cusp bifurcation : @xmath119 in conjunction with ( 20 ) .",
    "it should be noted that for power - law networks with @xmath120 , the number of possible fixed points for this system is three , which we call the weak coupling region .",
    "however , when the coupling is stronger , a degenerate @xmath105 point seems to emerge , which generates additional unstable and saddle states , and complicates the unfolding ( shown in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] ) , though much of the general structure is maintained for larger @xmath64 . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling region for power - law networks , because the comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs is more straightforward .",
    "the second local codimension - two bifurcation is the takens - bogdanov ( @xmath121 ) , at which the spectrum has a double root at zero .",
    "attached to this bifurcation are curves of @xmath92 and @xmath95 bifurcations as well as a curve of homoclinic bifurcations @xmath122 @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the period of a cycle diverges as it collides with a saddle - point and connects its stable and unstable manifolds ( e.g. , crossing @xmath123 in fig.[fig : bifurcation](a ) ) . to find the location of the @xmath121 bifurcation",
    ", we expand in powers of @xmath124 , and enforce that terms of order @xmath124 vanish , which gives the criterion : @xmath125 = 0 ,   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] that in conjunction with , determines the bifurcation point .",
    "finally , the highest codimension bifurcation that we consider arises when the @xmath105 collides with the @xmath121 ( @xmath126 ) , implying that , , and are all satisfied ( which also occurs in the hodgkin - huxley equations ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bifurcations discussed , this particular singularity predicts curves of codimension - two homoclinic bifurcations to saddle - node - loops ( @xmath127 ) and neutral saddles ( @xmath128 ) , and curves of degenerate hopf bifurcations ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the latter two are termination points for curves of limit - point - of - cycles ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "these bifurcations imply new behaviors that do not appear for homogeneous networks and have interesting effects on the dynamics .",
    "specifically , the @xmath130 transition entails that a stable cycle collides with an unstable cycle and disappears , while the @xmath129 entails that an @xmath130 emerges on a @xmath95 point  typically as the lyapunov exponent of the hopf cycle vanishes .",
    "because these bifurcations only occur when the @xmath121 is on the lower branch of the @xmath92 , they are not seen in homogeneous networks .",
    "lastly , the @xmath127 and @xmath128 entail that a homoclinic cycle is coincident with a @xmath92 and a saddle whose whose eigenvalues sum to zero , respectively @xcite ( see fig.[fig : bifurcation ] ) .",
    "in this section , we explore some of the implications of the behaviors discussed on the dynamics of driven homogeneous and heterogeneous networks . both the mean - field ( eq.[eq : fundamental ] ) and oscillator ( eq.[eq : forcingcmfram ] ) dynamics are examined .",
    "first , we can distill from the above that there are three primary ways that a stable mutually synchronized state can be created : @xmath99 , @xmath94 , and @xmath130 transitions .",
    "qualitatively , we can think of such states as limit cycles , and can consider how their average amplitude and frequency ( inverse period ) emerge through each transition .",
    "if we imagine changing one parameter ( e.g. @xmath131 ) , one of three things happens : the amplitude can appear continuously with a discontinuous frequency ( @xmath99 ) , the amplitude can appear discontinuously with continuous frequency ( @xmath94 ) , or the amplitude and frequency can both appear discontinuously ( @xmath130 ) . the special case of continuous",
    "amplitude and frequency appearance occurs through a @xmath121 bifurcation .",
    "fig.[fig : mutualcomp ] shows a comparison between the behaviors of mutually synchronized states produced by crossing these transitions .",
    "interestingly , we find that each transition has a signature in the average phase build - up with respect to the driving field .",
    "for example if the @xmath94 transition is crossed ( e.g. , crossing @xmath132 in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] ) , the order - parameter dynamics is a large limit cycle that includes the origin @xcite .",
    "this implies that the average phase of the network grows monotonically with respect to the field , and is therefore largely de - pinned from it , with a macroscopic number of nodes lapping it continually .",
    "moreover , this behavior holds widely for degree classes as well  most degrees continually lap the field on average , perhaps excluding low degree nodes ( e.g. , k=1 or 2 ) depending on the parameters ( fig.[fig : mutualcomp](b ) ) . on the other hand",
    "if the @xmath99 is crossed ( e.g. , crossing @xmath133 in fig.[fig : bifurcation ] ) , a small limit cycle emerges , centered around an unstable driven state . in this case",
    "there is no net build - up of the average phase with respect to the field ; the motion is analogous to quasi - periodicity with average frequency equal to the driving , and an emergent  wobble \" frequency given by @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "this behavior holds for all degree classes , implying that large and small degrees on average both have phase - trapped dynamics ( fig.[fig : mutualcomp ] ( a ) ) .",
    "however if the lpc transition is crossed ( e.g. , crossing @xmath134 in fig.[fig : bifurcation](b ) ) , a large cycle emerges for the order - parameter that includes the origin ( similar to the sniper ) , but only holds for nodes with large degree on average , i.e. , nodes of small degree undergo phase - trapped motion , while nodes of large degree undergo phase - slip motion ( fig.[fig : mutualcomp](c ) ) . if we consider moving up the @xmath130 by increasing @xmath131 , more and more high degree nodes become trapped by the field , until all are trapped , and the @xmath99 occurs  the opposite limit brings us to the lower @xmath94 ( see fig.[fig : bifurcation ] ) .",
    "another important difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous behavior concerns the bistability of driven and mutually synchronized states .",
    "phase portraits are given in fig.[fig : phaseportrait ] , projected onto the order parameter , which demonstrate the behavior in important parameter regions .",
    "for homogeneous networks , bistability exists in a small region of parameter space , confined between the @xmath105 and @xmath135 bifurcations ( i.e. , regions @xmath136 and @xmath137 in fig.[fig : bifurcation](a ) ) . in this case",
    ", there is bistability between two states of driven synchronization ( region @xmath136 and fig.[fig : phaseportrait](a ) ) , until the @xmath99 is crossed ( e.g. , crossing @xmath138 ) , and bistability between a state of quasi - periodic mutual synchronization and driven synchronization ( fig.[fig : phaseportrait](b ) ) @xcite . in both cases , the manifolds of the saddle act as a separatrix between the two stable states . in contrast , for heterogeneous networks there is only bistability between a large - amplitude state of mutual synchronization and a single state of driven synchronization .",
    "the mutually synchronized state encloses all three fixed points in region @xmath139 ( fig.[fig : bifurcation](b ) and fig.[fig : phaseportrait](d ) ) , and exists in an additional region that does not contain a saddle ( @xmath140 in fig.[fig : bifurcation](b ) and fig.[fig : phaseportrait](c ) ) .",

    "this cluster is comprised of oscillators that have natural frequencies near the driving , with frequency ranges for degree classes that typically increase with degree , so that higher degree classes are able to stabilize a broader range of frequencies .",

    ". the average velocities of phase - locked and winding nodes are shown in fig.[fig : velocity](a ) for a driven state as functions of their degrees and natural frequencies .",

    "the unfolding of this singularity was used to uncover important dynamical transitions including : saddle - node - infinite - period , hopf , and limit - point - of - cycles ( @xmath130 ) , as well as multiple bistability regions that differed for the network types .",
    "interestingly , we found that heterogeneous networks do not support bistability of driven synchronized states or bistability of quasi - periodic synchronized states and driven states ( which is the case for homogeneous networks ) , but only bistability of large amplitude mutually synchronized and driven states .",
    "moreover , we discovered that the @xmath130 transition for the heterogeneous branch occurs with phase - slip dynamics for nodes with high degree and phase - trapped dynamics for nodes with low degree ( on average ) , implying a new route to mutual synchronization for driven heterogeneous networks which allows for qualitatively different behavior depending on a node s degree .",
    "in addition , the structure of synchronization clusters for mutual and driven states was discussed and their transitions associated with bifurcations .    still , we have yet to resolve all of the transitions associated with unstable cycles in the heterogeneous case ( which could inform other interesting features of the dynamics ) , and the full unfolding of network bifurcations in the strong coupling region . moreover , many real networks of interest have richer architecture than the simple degree heterogeneity discussed here : such as modular , fractal , and multi - scale structure @xcite . the effects of these features on network synchronization are interesting subjects for future work . finally , the control of complex networks is of immense interest , both theoretical and practical .",
