    "molecular hydrogen is the predominant constituent of the dense gas in the universe .",
    "one of the most important questions in current astrophysics is how the first generation objects formed from the primordial gas that was not polluted by heavy elements ( e.g. omukai & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "theoretical models should be confirmed by observations to establish a more realistic scenario of the first generation objects in the universe .",
    "( 170mm,127mm)fig1.eps    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculation was made for the five lines listed in table  3 .",
    "parameters used here are from turner et al .",
    "first , it is interesting to compare the optical thickness of the line absorption and the dust extinction . in case of @xmath0 and the local heavy element abundance , the ratio of the line optical thickness to the dust optical thickness is @xmath1 for vib - rotational lines in nir , @xmath2 for pure rotational lines in mir , and @xmath3 for pure rotational lines of hd in the fir .",
    "it means that the absorption measurement is certainly difficult against the large extinction in the absorbing cloud .",
    "however , this ratio increases with the inverse of the heavy element abundance .",
    "therefore , in the lower heavy element abundance case , we can expect reasonably higher ratios .",
    "it is quite difficult to detect absorption lines whose optical thickness is less than 1  % .",
    "therefore , as seen from table  2 , only those clouds whose column density is larger than @xmath4 can be detected in absorption .",
    "figure  1a shows the absorption line flux expected for a cloud with the local heavy element abundance in front of a 10  mjy source .",
    "the absorption fluxes are far smaller than the @xmath5 expected sensitivity of the _ spica _ mission ( ueno et al .",
    "on the other hand , figure  1b shows the result for the case in which the heavy element abundance is 1  % of that of the local one .",
    "all five lines populate parameter space above or near the limit .",
    "figure  2 shows the result of the same calculation , but for the @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 line for various values of the heavy element abundance . in case of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", the absorption line can be detected .",
    "in this subsection we discuss possible energy sources at high redshifts . in our calculations",
    ", we have assumed an intrinsic continuum flux density of 10  mjy at the line wavelength .",
    "what sort of flux density can we expect from high-@xmath11 objects ? to investigate this ,",
    "we have plotted in figure  3 the sed in the rest system of several high redshift objects for which observations are available .",
    "the sources and references for them are as follows : iras  f@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ; rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1993 ; barvainis et al .",
    "1995 ) , h@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ; barvainis et al .",
    "1995 ) , smm  @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ; ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , smm  j@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ; ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) , apm  @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ; lewis et al .  1988 ) , and br  @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ; isaak et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this plot",
    "we have not corrected for the possible lens amplification for the first three objects and all observations have been transformed to a common redshift of 5 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the rest system seds and flux densities of f@xmath12 and h@xmath14 are almost identical and encompass three of the lines  17 , 28 , and 112  @xmath25 m .",
    "the interpolated flux densities at the three frequencies are 8 , 16 , and 9  mjy respectively .",
    "for the rest of the sources , we extrapolate from the observed 450  @xmath25 m flux density assuming the rest system sed to be the same as that of f@xmath12 . from this exercise",
    "we find the range of flux densities to be @xmath26  mjy at 17  @xmath25 m , @xmath27  mjy at 28  @xmath25 m , and @xmath28  mjy at 112  @xmath25 m .",
    "on the other hand , if we use the sed of arp  220 , the expected flux densities are about 38 times larger at 17  @xmath25 m , 11 times at 28  @xmath25 m , and about the same at 112  @xmath25 m . for distant highly luminous sources , arp  220",
    "sed may not be appropriate since solomon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that for a sample of ultraluminous ir galaxies out to a redshift of 0.3 , the emission at 100  @xmath25 m may be optically thick .",
    "following their finding , if we use a 60  k blackbody spectrum as a template , the expected flux densities at 17 and 28  @xmath25 m are a factor of 5 and 3 lower as compared with using arp  220 sed .",
    "thus , if we have objects at @xmath29 at least as luminous as our template sources , it is possible to observe absorption in @xmath30 lines of 17 , 28 , and 112  @xmath25 m respectively",
    ". the redshifted 112  @xmath25 m line will be in the submm range and may not be observable by space missions of near future .",
    "however , the proposed large area and high sensitivity ground - based mm ",
    "submm interferometric arrays like alma should be able to observe it .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to observe the absorption of 2.2  @xmath25 m lines since the expected flux density based on dust emission spectrum is a factor of 10 or more lower as compared with that at 17  @xmath25 m .",
    "however , if a bright non - thermal flat spectrum source is present , absorption measurement at 2.2  @xmath25 m may be possible .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig2.eps    first we simply estimate the column density of a protogalactic hydrogen cloud . here",
    "we assume that the size of the cloud @xmath31 is a few kpc and that the gas mass @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "such a large reservoir of molecular gas has been discovered at high redshift ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "such clouds have column density of @xmath34 \\ , f     \\left(\\frac{r}{3\\;[{\\rm kpc}]}\\right)^{-2 }    \\left ( \\frac{m}{10^{11}m_\\odot}\\right ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the mass fraction of the molecular clouds to the total gas mass , and @xmath32 is the total gas mass of the protogalaxy .",
    "the final fate of such a large reservoir of gas may be the formation of a giant galaxy , whose typical core radius is a few kpc . if such a collapse really occurs in the formation epoch of galaxies , resulting column density is as large as the minimum column density ( @xmath36 ) needed for detecting @xmath30 line absorption .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig3.eps    in a realistic situation , a primordial cloud may evolve dynamically on a free - fall timescale .",
    "the free - fall timescale is much shorter than the timescale of cosmological structure evolution , e.g.  the hubble timescale .",
    "therefore , observed properties are specific to the redshift at which the cloud absorption is measured .",
    "we will obtain redshift @xmath11 , and velocity dispersion @xmath37 .",
    "the present structure formation theory provides us the relation between the velocity dispersion and the corresponding dynamical mass of the cloud as a function of redshift , @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "thus , we can constrain the structure formation theory . the spica mission",
    "will provide us with the information on the massive objects ( @xmath39 ) at @xmath40 .",
    "we still have to wait for more sensitive facilities for the observational approach to the `` population iii '' objects , whose physical properties are theoretically predicted by recent extensive investigations , because they are located at higher redshift and their typical mass is small ( e.g. , nishi & susa 1999 ) .",
    "when we estimate the detectability of such objects by other facilities , the algorithm constructed in this paper can be applied straightforwardly .    the above estimate ( equation 5 ) is based on the mean column density of a galaxy .",
    "if we have a chance to detect the final phase of a collpsing gas in the line of sight of a quasar , we can constrain the physical state of such a collpase . in other words , we will be able to measure the column density @xmath41 , and excitation temperature @xmath42 , which are interesting quantities in the context of the evolution of an individual cloud .",
    "recent theoretical work ( e.g. , omukai & nishi 1998 ; omukai 2000 ) proposes the following scenario .",
    "the collapsing primordial gas must radiate its gravitational energy before the first generation objects are born from it . however , the gas consisting of only hydrogen and helium atoms can not cool efficiently below @xmath43 k because their constituents do not have radiative transitions corresponding @xmath44 k to @xmath43 k. therefore , a much more efficient cooling process must be working at this stage of the universe .",
    "the most plausible cooling process is vib - rotational and pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen .",
    "if the molecular hydrogen is effectively produced in the collapsing primordial gas at @xmath43 k , the expected time scale of the gas contraction is considerably reduced .",
    "galli & palla ( 1998 ) indicated that so called relic electrons would work there as effective catalyst to produce primordial molecular clouds .",
    "if we have a high - precision measurements and follow - up observations of the absorption cloud , we might be able to pursue the dynamical evolution of the cloud and to compare the theoretical predictions .",
