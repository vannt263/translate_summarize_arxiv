    "graphene , a one - atom thick layer of carbon atoms , has become a research attraction pole since its experimental discovery in 2004 @xcite .",
    "since carriers in graphene behave like relativistic and chiral massless fermions with a linear - in - wave vector spectrum , many interesting features could be tested with this material such as the klein paradox@xcite , which was recently observed@xcite , the anomalous quantum hall effect , etc .",
    ", see ref .",
    "for two recent reviews .",
    "the effort to realise this klein tunnelling through a potential barrier also lead to other interesting features , such as resonant tunnelling through double barriers @xcite . with the possibility to fabricate devices with single - layer graphene ,",
    "bilayer graphene has also been extensively investigated and been shown to possess extraordinary electronic behaviour , such as a gapless spectrum , in the absence of bias , and chiral carriers@xcite .",
    "many of these nanostructures could be given another functionality if based on bilayer instead of single - layer graphene .",
    "the electronic band structure can be modified by the application of a periodic potential and/or magnetic barriers .",
    "such superlattices ( sls ) are commonly used to alter the band structure of nanomaterials . in single - layer graphene already a number of papers relate their work to the theoretical understanding of such periodic structures@xcite .",
    "much less experimental and theoretical work has been done on bilayer graphene@xcite .",
    "we will study the spectrum , the transmission , and the conductance of bilayer graphene through an array of potential barriers using a simple model : the kronig - penney ( kp ) model@xcite , i.e. a one - dimensional periodic succession of @xmath0-function barriers on bilayer graphene .",
    "the advantage of such a model system is that , 1 ) a lot can be done analytically , 2 ) the system is clearly defined , 3 ) and it is possible to show a number of exact relations .",
    "the present research is also motivated by our recent findings for single - layer graphene@xcite , where very interesting and unexpected properties were found , for instance , that the transmission and energy spectrum are periodic in the strength of the @xmath0-function barriers .",
    "surprisingly , we find that for bilayer graphene similar , but different , properties are found as function of the strength of the @xmath0-function potential barriers . due to the different electronic spectra close to the dirac point , i.e. , linear for graphene and quadratic for bilayer graphene , we find very different transmission probabilities through a finite number of barriers and very different energy spectrum , for a superlattice of @xmath0-function barriers , between single - layer and bilayer graphene .",

    "the precise energy ranges are not explicitly known and may depend on the particular property studied . for the range pertaining to the four - band hamiltonian ab - initio results @xcite indicate that it is approximately from @xmath208 ev to + @xmath209 ev .",
    "the question arises whether the above periodicities in @xmath2 survive when the potential barriers have a finite width . to assess that we briefly investigated the spectrum of a rectangular sl potential with thin barriers and compared it with that in the kp limit .",
    "we showed with some examples that for specific sl parameters the kp model is acceptable in a narrow range of @xmath2 and only as a rough approximation away from this range .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the periodicity of the kp model .    the main differences between the results of this work and those of our previous one , ref .",
