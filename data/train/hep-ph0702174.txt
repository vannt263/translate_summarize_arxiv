    "heavy flavor production in high energy processes is usually described in the collinear or @xmath0 factorization frameworks of perturbative qcd .",
    "reactions with nuclear targets allow one to study new important features of multiple scatterings and parton saturation , which is characterized by the scale @xmath4@xcite . for a large nucleus at higher energy , this scale can be large and comparable to the heavy quark mass @xmath5 , so that @xmath6 .",
    "in this situation , realized at rhic and definitely at future lhc , we can investigate saturation physics through heavy quark production with the generalized framework of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "heavy quarks are produced by initial hard interactions and subsequently propagate in the hot flowing medium which modifies the @xmath7 spectrum of the quarks and the quarkonium yield@xcite . in order to quantify these in - medium effects in hot matter , proton / deuteron - nucleus ( pa ) collisions play a decisive role providing the baseline of the initial nuclear effects . here",
    ", we will compute heavy quark production in high energy pa collisions using the cgc framework that incorporates both multiple scattering and small @xmath1 evolution effects .",
    "in pa collisions , which is a prototype of a dilute - dense system , the particle production cross - sections are known analytically to the leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath8 and the proton source @xmath9 , but to all orders in the dense nuclear source @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the cross - section of the quark pair production is written in the cgc framework as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the momenta and rapidities of the gluons coming from the proton and the nucleus .",
    "a shorthand notation @xmath15 stands for the matrix element squared , whose explicit form can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the leading twist approximation on both the proton and nuclear sides ,",
    "this @xmath16 reduces to the lo hard matrix element in the @xmath0 factorization formalism@xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 is the @xmath0-dependent gluon distribution in the proton , which is related to the usual gluon distribution function via : @xmath18 the multi - gluon correlations in the large nucleus are encoded in the expression ( [ eq : cross - section - ln ] ) as the 3-point correlator ( large @xmath3 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the forward scattering amplitude of the right - moving dipole @xmath21 with @xmath22 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the su(@xmath3 ) generator in the fundamental representation .    on the proton side ,",
    "the collinear approximation is more appropriate because the typical @xmath24 should be small  @xmath25 as long as @xmath26 is not too small , especially in the forward rapidity ( large @xmath26 ) region . as noted in refs .",

    "preliminary data are taken from star  @xcite .",

    "we see at rhic energy the cronin peak moving to higher @xmath7 with the rapidity @xmath41 because the charm pair production is dominated by the moderate @xmath42 region . instead , at lhc energy we see larger suppression with @xmath41 ; note that fixed coupling @xmath34=0.2 yields too large @xmath43 of @xmath44 compared with hera analysis .",
    "the saturation effects can be seen even in the b meson productions at this energy .",
