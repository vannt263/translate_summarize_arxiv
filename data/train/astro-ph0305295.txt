    "during the discussion led by r.  narayan at this conference it became clear that the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole in the galactic centre at a radius of @xmath01  pc is @xmath1  m@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "the central black hole is thus extremely sub - eddington . in order to understand the fueling mechanisms of the central engine",
    ", there is an inevitable need for understanding the gas physics and dynamics in the inner @xmath450  pc of the galaxy .",
    "gas that flows radially into the galactic centre has to pass several barriers . at large scales ( @xmath0kpc )",
    "the gas has to cross the resonance of the inner lindblad radius . according to the gravitational potential of the galactic bulge region",
    ", there might be a second inner lindblad radius that the gas has to overcome .",
    "when the gas finally arrives in the inner 200  pc of the galaxy , it is very clumpy and has a volume filling factor of a few percent ( launhardt et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this environment",
    "five different environmental effects determine the structure of the ism : ( i ) the stellar radiation field , ( ii ) stellar winds , ( iii ) the shear due to differential rotation , ( iv ) instabilities due to self - gravitation , and ( v ) supernovae .",
    "we modeled analytically the properties of the gas located in the inner 20  pc including the effects ( i)(iv ) ( vollmer & duschl 2001a , 2001b ) . in a second step we investigated the collision of an external gas cloud falling onto an existing disk structure in the galactic centre ( vollmer & duschl 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the line - of - sight distribution of the giant molecular clouds in the inner 50  pc of the galaxy were reconstructed using their nir absoprtion ( vollmer et al .",
    "in the inner 20  pc of the galaxy the gas is very clumpy with a volume filling factor of @xmath41% .",
    "these clumps have masses of @xmath430  m@xmath2 and sizes of @xmath40.1  pc ( see e.g. jackson et al .",
    "they are illuminated by the uv radiation field of the central hei star cluster and form a ring - like structure that is known as the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) ( gsten et al .",
    "[ fig : vollmerb_fig1 ] illustrates the situation .",
    "the whole cnd has a total gas mass of several 10@xmath5  m@xmath2 .",
    "the inner edge is located at a radius of @xmath42  pc where the density of the neutral gas drops by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the gas in the central 4  pc is ionized and forms the giant hii region sgr  a  west .",
    "our analytical model to describe the gas properties consists of two parts : + ( i ) small scale : the gas clumps are described as isothermal spheres that are partially ionized by the uv radiation field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vollmerb_fig2 ] ) .",
    "the gas temperature of the clouds is assumed to be proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "+ ( ii ) large scale : the properties of clouds located at different distances from the galactic centre are determined .",
    "the clumpy gas distribution is then smeared out to obtain a quasi - continuous disk structure that is described by the standard set of accretion disk equations with a modified viscosity prescription taking the radiative energy dissipation during clump  clump collisions into account .",
    "both models are connected via the central density of the clumps that is proportional to the central density of the disk : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the volume filling factor .",
    "in addition , the clump properties influence the disk viscosity via the local energy dissipation rate .",
    "the main results of this modelling are : +",
    "( i ) there are two solutions for our set of equations that correspond to two stable clump regimes : the observed heavy clumps @xmath410  m@xmath2 and the stripped cores of the heavy clouds with masses between 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath10m@xmath2 .",
    "+ ( ii ) within the disk , the number of collisions between clouds is very low ( @xmath11 yr@xmath3 for about 500 clouds ) .",
    "+ ( iii ) the inferred mass accretion rate for the isolated cnd is @xmath12m@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "+ ( iv ) the cnd is much more stable and has a much longer lifetime ( @xmath13 yr ) than previously assumed .",
    "the disk clouds are exposed to strong stellar winds , the central uv radiation field , and strong tidal shear .",
    "we show that stellar winds shape the clouds , but do not affect their other properties . in order to resist the strong shear due to differential rotation each cloud s central densities must increase with decreasing distance to the galactic centre .",
    "its outer radius is determined by the uv radiation field at the illuminated side and by the external gas pressure at the shadowed side opposite to the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "we show analytically that for a temperature gradient of the form @xmath14 the radius of the massive clouds are constant irrespective of their location in the disk .",
    "thus , clouds that can resist tidal shear will become more and more massive when approaching the galactic centre . finally , they will collapse when their masses exceed the jeans limit .",
    "we suggest that the cloud distribution within the cnd reflects two selection effects .",
    "first , the clouds have to be dense enough to resist tidal shear and second , the clouds that are too massive collapse and will form stars . magnetic fields and rotation stabilize otherwise gravitationally unstable clouds .",
    "this mechanism naturally explains the existence of the inner edge of the cnd : fig .",
    "[ fig : vollmerb_fig3 ] shows the central density of the heavy clouds versus the distance from the galactic centre .",
    "the limits for gravitational collapse and tidal disruption cross at @xmath152  pc .",
    "the dashed surface represents the range of densities where clouds are gravitationally and tidally stable .",
    "in a next step , we use our knowledge acquired with the analytical model to build a realistic dynamical model in order to investigate the gas dynamics in the inner 50  pc of the galaxy . since a circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) consisting of small clumps with a tiny volume - filling factor can be long - lived ( several myr , see sect .  [ sec : analytical ] ) , we study the scenario where a part of a giant molecular cloud falls onto a pre - existing cnd .",
    "we use a collisional n - body code where each particle represents a gas clump with a certain mass and radius .",
    "the infalling gas cloud also consists of a number of small subclumps .",
    "these clumps have masses around the observed value of 30  m@xmath2 .",
    "when a clump approaches the galactic centre closer than 2  pc , it is assumed to be destroyed by tidal forces or by gravitational collapse ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : analytical ] ) .",
    "these clumps are counted as accreted .",
    "the collisional n - body code yields a realistic cloud collision rate that depends on the cloud radius , density , and dispersion velocity .",
    "a realistic simulation of an isolated cnd shows the observed disk structure .",
    "this simulation yields a mean collision time scale of a cloud of @xmath16  myr and a mass accretion rate of @xmath17  m@xmath2yr@xmath18  m@xmath2yr@xmath3 . the infalling cloud , which has a mass of several 10@xmath5  m@xmath2 , is assumed to be on ( i ) a prograde orbit and ( ii ) a retrograde orbit with respect to this cnd .",
    "we study the resulting cloud ",
    "cloud collision rate and the mass accretion rate using different loss rates of the kinetic energy during a collision .",
    "[ fig : vollmerb_fig4 ] shows a prograde ( left side ) and a retrograde ( right side ) encounter with a loss of 10% of the kinetic energy of the clumps during a collision .",
    "the main difference between the two simulations is that the cnd is destroyed 3 - 4  myr after the first encounter with the external cloud in the case of a retrograde encounter .",
    "its mass is mainly accreted onto the galactic centre . at the end of the simulation a second cnd has formed that has approximately the angular momentum of the infalling cloud , but there is still a counter - rotating core visible , which represents the remnant of the former cnd . in the case of a prograde encounter , the infalling mass is partly added to the pre - existing one .",
    "the outcome of this simulation is a warped cnd that is more massive than the pre - existing cnd . within our scenario of an encounter between an infalling molecular cloud and a cnd , it is possible",
    "that the observed heii star cluster in the galactic centre has been formed by a retrograde encounter of a cloud with the cnd @xmath47  myr ago .",
    "the cloud that formed the heii star cluster has been destroyed by tidal forces and can presently no longer be distinguished as a single kinematical entity .",
    "the fueling of the central black hole in the future depends mainly on the present dynamics of the gas in the inner 50  pc of the galaxy . within this region",
    "the gas is heavily clumped and mainly in the form of giant molecular clouds .",
    "following zylka et al .",
    "( 1990 ) three main giant molecular cloud complexes can be distinguished : ( i ) sgr  a east core , a compact giant molecular cloud with a gas mass of several 10@xmath19 m@xmath2 located north  east of sgr  a@xmath20 .",
    "( ii ) the giant molecular cloud m-0.02 - 0.07 located to the east of sgr  a@xmath20 . since its mean radial velocity is @xmath450  kms@xmath3 , it is also called the 50  kms@xmath3 cloud .",
    "( iii ) the gmc complex m-0.13 - 0.08 located south of sgr  a@xmath20 . since its mean radial velocity is @xmath420  kms@xmath3 , it is also called the 20  kms@xmath3 cloud .",
    "the sgr a east core is part of the 50  kms@xmath3 cloud complex , thus we will treat these features as a single structure .",
    "[ fig : vollmerb_fig5 ] shows a sketch of the inner 30  pc of the galaxy , where the main features are indicated ( minispiral , cnd , 20  kms@xmath3 cloud , 50  kms@xmath3 cloud ) .",
    "if one wants to understand the gas dynamics in the central 50  pc of the galaxy , it is of crucial importance to know the line - of - sight distribution of the giant molecular clouds ( 20 and 50  kms@xmath3 clouds ) located in this region .",
    "we reconstruct the line - of - sight distribution assuming ( i ) an axis - symmetric stellar distribution and ( ii ) that the clouds are optically thick and have an area filling factor @xmath41 , i.e. that they entirely block the light from the stars located behind them .",
    "[ fig : vollmerb_fig6 ] shows the reconstructed los distribution of the giant molecular clouds in colors . the iram",
    "30 m 1.2  mm observations of zylka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are overlayed as contours . due to the method of reconstruction",
    ", los distances close to sgr  a@xmath20 ( @xmath0 - 10  pc ) have a small uncertainty , whereas larger los distances might be located up to a factor 2 farther away from sgr  a@xmath20 .",
    "the relative distances are robust results .",
    "we found that : + all structures seen in the 1.2  mm observations ( zylka et al .",
    "1998 ) and cs(2 - 1 ) observations ( gsten et al . in prep . )",
    "are present in absorption .",
    "+ the 50  kms@xmath3 cloud complex is located between 0  pc and -5  pc , i.e. in front of sgr  a@xmath20 .",
    "it has a small los distance gradient .",
    "+ the 20  kms@xmath3 cloud complex is located in front of the 50  kms@xmath3 cloud complex .",
    "the subclump of strongest absorption has a los distance between -40  pc and -20  pc .",
    "+ the cnd is not seen in absorption .",
    "this gives an upper limit to the cloud sizes within the cnd of @xmath40.06  pc .",
    "the combination of the los distribution of the gas and its kinematics will help to unravel the dynamics of the gas in the inner 50  pc of the galaxy , which represents the future fueling of the central black hole .",
    "from the present modeling of the gas in the inner 50  pc of the galaxy we have learned about crucial aspects of the gas physics and dynamics .",
    "we found that the mass accretion rate into the central parsec is highly variable and a period of almost no mass accretion is conceivable .",
    "this period of starvation might last about 10@xmath5  yr , which is the cloud  cloud collision time within the cnd .",
    "we are now in the position to use the acquired knowledge to determine the temporal behaviour of the mass accretion rate in the past and how it might change in the future .",
    "remaining questions are : + can we find clear signs of past interactions of an external cloud with a pre - existing circumnuclear disk ? will the accreted mass exclusively come from the cnd in the near future ?",
    "will there be a major accretion event in the near future , when a part of a massive giant molecular cloud interacts with the cnd ?",
    "we already have the keys in our hand to unravel the exciting history and future of the gas dynamics in the galactic centre .",
