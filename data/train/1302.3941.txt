    "recent investigations have demonstrated that the profiles of class 0/i sources can be fitted by single power - law profiles over a wide range of radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite modeled class 0 source maps using a single power - law density distribution @xmath15 and found that most of them can be well fitted with a power - law index of @xmath16 .",

    "extensive surveys of such blue - skewed spectra in starless cores have been carried out by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite conducted the profile fitting using a simple two - layer radiative transfer model and suggested an inward motion of subsonic speed ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) that extended to @xmath19 in the pre - protostellar core l1544 .",
    "the velocity structures of dense cores , including not only infalling motion but also rotation , have also been investigated using first and second moment images of line emission taken with single - dish telescopes and interferometers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "statistical studies for the rotation of dense cores were conducted using @xmath20 and @xmath21 line emissions by @xcite and @xcite , in which the typical velocity gradients are found to be @xmath22@xmath23 . on the other hand , @xcite observed @xmath24@xmath1 line emission toward nine low - mass protostellar envelopes down to @xmath25 scales .",

    "no emission in the @xmath85 transition was detected .    to estimate the optical depth and gas kinetic temperature",
    ", we analyzed the hyperfine structures that are caused by the electric quadrupole moment of the nitrogen nucleus .",
    "we derived the peak main - beam temperatures ( @xmath117 ) and intrinsic velocity widths ( @xmath118 ) by fitting each line component with a gaussian function .",
    "we assumed that all hyperfine components have equal beam filling factors and excitation temperatures .",
    "we estimated the optical depth of the @xmath119 main component [ @xmath120 , the rotational temperature [ @xmath121 that describes the relative population between the @xmath122 and @xmath84 levels , and the kinetic temperature ( @xmath123 ) by following the analysis in a previous work by @xcite . with the parameters of the best - fit results ( summarized in table [ tbl:3 ] ) shown by the blue curves in figure [ fig:1 ] , we obtained @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the rotational temperature is almost equal to the kinetic temperature for the range of @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we determined that the b335 core has a mean kinetic temperature of @xmath128 over the beam area of the 45 m telescope ( @xmath129 ) , and used this temperature to estimate the isothermal sound speed and the column density from the molecular line data .",
    "we detected @xmath65 continuum emission with the nma toward the iras source in b335 , as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the peak position was measured to be @xmath130 , @xmath131 ( b1950 ) , which is consistent with the peak position of the @xmath132 continuum images @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 continuum image shows an elongated emission structure perpendicular to the outflow lying from east to west @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a cavity - like distribution in the red - lobe side of the molecular outflow can be seen which is quite similar to that in the @xmath132 continuum image shown by @xcite and supports their suggestion that this distribution traces the wall of the outflow cavity .",
    "the beam deconvolved size , peak intensity , and total flux density ( above the @xmath133 contour ) are @xmath134 ( corresponding to @xmath135 ) , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , contribution from free  free emission is considered to be negligible when taking into account the extrapolation from the flux at @xmath138 .",
    "thus , we determine that the @xmath65 continuum emission comes from a dust envelope surrounding a protostellar object . under the condition of being optically thin for thermal dust emission , the dust envelope mass ( @xmath139 )",
    "was estimated using the equation @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the total flux density , @xmath142 is the dust mass opacity coefficient , @xmath143 is the dust temperature , @xmath144 is the source distance , and @xmath145 is the planck function . by combining our @xmath65 and image band @xmath146 measurements with the flux densities at millimeter wavelengths estimated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we obtained a spectral index of @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "the spectral index gives @xmath149 for the emissivity law , @xmath150 , using the approximated relation , @xmath151 , which is valid for millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thus , given @xmath152 @xcite , we obtain a dust mass opacity of @xmath153 .",
    "the dust envelope mass is estimated to be @xmath154 with a dust temperature of @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the panels of figure [ fig:3 ] show the integrated intensity images of the @xmath156@xmath1 line emission over the lsr velocity range from @xmath157 to @xmath158 made using the 45 m telescope data ( left ) and the combined 45 m telescope and nma data ( right ) .",
    "we should note that this combined map includes the effect of the primary beam attenuation of the nma so that extended emission toward the outside of the image seen in the 45 m telescope image is not reproduced in the combined image .",
    "the @xmath78 emission in the 45 m telescope map has a single - peaked spatial distribution and shows an elongation from north to south .",
    "the size of the @xmath78 core above the @xmath133 level is @xmath159 , with a p.a . of @xmath160 . the 45 m telescope plus nma combined map shown in the right panel of figure [ fig:3 ] clearly depicts the detailed structure of the inner core including large - scale flux distributions with a high resolution .",
    "the higher contours of @xmath161 show an elongated distribution from north to south with a size of @xmath162 , which is believed to be an inner dense envelope associated with a central stellar source .",
    "the envelope has a double peak near the center , and the @xmath65 continuum source is located between the peaks .",
    "the elongation of the core and inner envelope is perpendicular to the molecular outflow axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the 45 m telescope map , there are faint ridges from the center along the p.a . of @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 ,",
    "and they can be seen more clearly in the combined map . taking the outflow direction and opening angle into account ( @xmath49 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we believe that these ridges are related to the outflow activity .    in the velocity channel maps obtained with the 45 m telescope shown in figure [ fig:4 ] ,",
    "the emission peaks are located at the north of the @xmath65 continuum source in the velocity range @xmath166@xmath167 , and at the south in the velocity range @xmath168@xmath169 .",
    "this velocity gradient is perpendicular to the outflow axis and can be interpreted as the rotational motion of the b335 core . on the other hand , in the channel maps of combined data shown in figure [ fig:5 ] , it is difficult to identify the corresponding velocity gradient because of the complicated emission distribution .",
    "more detailed kinematics of the b335 core are discussed in section [ subsubsec:3.3.3 ] and [ subsec:4.2 ] using position ",
    "velocity ( pv ) diagrams made from the 45 m telescope and combined images .      in order to estimate the column density of the b335 protostellar core",
    ", we analyzed the @xmath78 images made from the 45-m telescope and the combined nma plus 45 m telescope data .",
    "under the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) assumption , the @xmath170 column density can be calculated using the following formula : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the excitation temperature , @xmath173 is the optical depth of the @xmath78 line , and @xmath174 is the fractional abundance of @xmath78 .",
    "when deriving of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we used the permanent dipole moment @xmath175 @xcite and the rotational constant @xmath176 . to obtain a complementary expression for the combined synthesized image",
    ", we convert the antenna temperature into the flux density @xmath141 in the @xmath177 through @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the beam solid angle given by @xmath180 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath181    we assumed the excitation temperature of @xmath182 from the @xmath183 analysis ( section [ subsec:3.1 ] ) and the @xmath78 line of the optically thin limit .",
    "we assumed @xmath174 to be @xmath184 @xcite . the derived total mass from the 45 m telescope map ( the left panel of figure [ fig:3 ] ) is @xmath185 .",
    "we derived the radial column density profile in the b335 core from the column density map calculated by the above formula .",
    "the column densities were calculated from re - gridded images with cell sizes corresponding to the spatial resolutions of the images , i.e. , @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) for the combined image and @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) for the 45 m image .",
    "the column density profile was made as a function of the radius from the @xmath65 peak using the distributions of the estimated column densities over the re - gridded cells . in order to calculate the column density , the 45 m plus nma image needed to be corrected for the primary beam attenuation , which increases the noise level in the outer region of the image .",
    "hence , the column density profile in the outer region of the core was derived using the 45 m telescope data , and the 45 m plus nma combined data were used to fill in the inner region of @xmath190 where the data can not be obtained from 45 m telescope data .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] represents the resulting @xmath170 column density profiles obtained in the above procedure .",
    "as suggested in section [ subsubsec:3.3.1 ] , the b335 core could be affected by the outflow . to examine this effect we also made the column density profile by masking out the regions with p.a .",
    "of @xmath191@xmath192 and @xmath193@xmath194 .",
    "the masking angle of @xmath195 was chosen to match the opening angle of the outflow : @xmath49 by @xcite and @xmath196 by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:6](a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath170 column density profile without and with the masking , respectively . for both profiles , we can see that the column densities estimated from the 45 m and combined data are smoothly connected around the radius of @xmath197 , and that the profiles in the inner radius are shallower than those in the outer radius .",
    "the column density profiles were fitted by two power - law functions of @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the power - law index and @xmath200 is the column density at @xmath201 . since figure [ fig:6 ] clearly shows two different slopes between the inner and outer regions , we estimated the turnover radius at which the power - law index changes .",
    "we evaluated the correlation coefficient of the power - law fitting in the range of @xmath202@xmath203 , where the inner radius ( @xmath202 ) was variable and the outer radius ( @xmath203 ) was fixed to @xmath204 . as a result",
    ", we found that the correlation coefficient of the fitting decreased exceedingly when the fitting inner radius was taken inside of @xmath205 .",
    "thus , we adopted a turnover radius of @xmath205 in this paper and performed the power - law fittings in the two regions of @xmath206@xmath205 and @xmath207@xmath208 separately .",
    "for the inner region ranging from @xmath206 to @xmath205 , we obtained @xmath209 without masking , and @xmath210 with masking .",
    "for the outer region from @xmath207 to @xmath208 , we obtained @xmath211 without masking and @xmath212 with masking .",
    "the column density profile obtained with masking was estimated to be slightly shallower than that without the masks . from our fitting result ,",
    "the column density at @xmath213 is @xmath214 , which is consistent with the estimate by @xcite , @xmath215 . using our results , we examined the density distribution of the b335 core ( discussed in section [ subsubsec:4.1.1 ] ) and estimated the total mass of gas associated with the b335 core to be @xmath216 within the radius of @xmath217 .",
    "to examine the overall velocity structure in the b335 core , we made pv diagrams using the combined @xmath0@xmath1 line data as shown in figure [ fig:7 ] , with black contours and gray scales .",
    "we chose the two axes of @xmath218 ( perpendicular to the outflow axis ) and @xmath219 ( along the outflow axis ) , passing through the @xmath65 continuum source .",
    "the comparison with the diagrams made from the low - spatial - resolution 45 m data overlaid with blue contours demonstrates a drastic effect of data combining . along the p.a .",
    "of @xmath220 , the 45 m telescope data show a slight velocity gradient , @xmath221 over a scale of @xmath8 .",
    "this gradient is comparable to the typical value of the cores in the taurus dark cloud @xcite .",
    "if the gradient represents a solid - body - like rotation of the core , then it is converted into an angular velocity of @xmath222 . on the other hand , the diagram of p.a . of @xmath223",
    "does not show a conspicuous velocity gradient .",
    "the diagrams of the 45 m and nma combined data show line broadening and a double - peaked intensity profile at the core center ( offset @xmath224 ) . with a broadening line width toward the core center , the diagram along the p.a",
    ". of @xmath220 shows an overall symmetrical diamond - like structure ( represented by a dashed line in light gray ) .",
    "we calculated intensity - weighted first and second moments defined by @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively .",
    "the second moment at the center ( offset of @xmath227 ) was @xmath228 , whereas that at the offset of @xmath229 was @xmath230 .",
    "the double - peaked profile at the core center is also slightly visible in the diagram made from the 45-m telescope data .",
    "this profile has asymmetrical features that are more enhanced in the blueshifted peak than in the redshifted one .",
    "this blue - skewed profile is maybe due to the infall motion of the core @xcite because the @xmath231 line emission is moderately optically thick around the systemic velocity ( see section [ subsubsec:4.1.3 ] ) .",
    "the center of the overall symmetrical emission distribution ( lowest contour ) , as represented with a dashed diamond in figure [ fig:7](a ) , is approximately @xmath232 and @xmath227 , which is considered to be the dynamical center of the b335 core .",
    "since the lsr velocity of @xmath233 is consistent with the peak velocities of the @xmath20 main components ( section [ subsec:3.1 ] ) , we adopt an lsr velocity of @xmath233 as the systemic velocity of the protostellar system .",
    "when a molecular cloud core has a density distribution of @xmath234 , the profile of the column density integrated along the line of sight has a relation of @xmath235 .",
    "hence , our obtained indices of @xmath236 in the inner part of the b335 core and of @xmath237 in the outer part correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we note that these indices barely varied even if we considered the influence of the cavity in the core made by the outflow .",
    "the column density profile derived from our 45 m and combined data with masking ( section [ subsubsec:3.3.2 ] ) can be converted into the number density distribution : @xmath238    most previous studies have derived density profiles for the b335 star - forming core similar to our observational results : inner and outer indices of @xmath239 and @xmath240 , respectively , with a turnover radius of @xmath241 . a power - law index of @xmath242 for the density profile was estimated from single - dish observations of the @xmath243@xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath1 line emissions ( radius range of @xmath244@xmath245 ) by @xcite . from near - infrared extinction measurements , @xcite suggested that the b335 core has a constant power - law index of @xmath246 over the region @xmath247@xmath248 , and otherwise displays inside - out collapse with an infalling radius ( see section [ subsec:4.2 ] ) of @xmath249 ( corresponding to @xmath250 ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested a single power law with @xmath251 within the inner @xmath252 region from interferometric observations of @xmath253 and @xmath254 continuum .",
    "these results agree well with our estimate of the density profile from the @xmath0@xmath1 data",
    ". meanwhile , detailed analysis of scuba @xmath255 and @xmath256 continuum maps by @xcite showed that the model with a power - law index of @xmath257 well describes the data as a best - fit result , and suggested an infalling radius of @xmath258 , which is smaller than estimates in our as well as previous studies .",
    "@xcite recently conducted an unbiased fitting to the dust continuum observations toward b335 .",
    "for the power - law density distribution , they obtained @xmath259@xmath260 throughout the envelope , although they did not find strong evidence of inside - out collapse with an infalling radius of @xmath261 .",
    "we confirmed the above estimate of the density profile from our combined @xmath0@xmath1 line data using an analysis of the visibility data of the @xmath65 continuum emission observed with the nma .",
    "this approach of directly examining in the @xmath108@xmath109 domain enables us to avoid possible artifacts caused by the deconvolution of interferometric images .    when discussing the emission distribution of the inner region of an envelope observed with interferometers , we should consider the temperature distribution of the envelope .",
    "we consider the observed intensity as a function of the impact parameter , @xmath262 , from an optically thin dust envelope that has a spherical density distribution , @xmath14 , and a dust temperature , @xmath263 .",
    "if the density and temperature follow radial power laws , @xmath264 and @xmath265 , and if we assume that the opacity does not vary along the line of sight , then the intensity profile also has a power - law profile , @xmath266 , in the rayleigh ",
    "jeans regime .",
    "we assumed that the extent of source intensity @xmath262 is sufficiently compact in the primary beam .",
    "the visibility amplitude as a function of @xmath108@xmath109 distance ( @xmath267 ) can be given by @xmath268 for @xmath269 ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "figure [ fig:8 ] shows a plot of binned visibility amplitudes as a function of the @xmath108@xmath109 distance for the @xmath65 continuum data .",
    "the binning is logarithmic , and the amplitudes are obtained as the vectorial average of the complex visibilities in each bin .",
    "the decrease in visibility amplitude with @xmath108@xmath109 distance can be interpreted as a power law .",
    "we fitted the visibility amplitude profile with a power - law function of the form @xmath270 .",
    "the best - fit power - law index is @xmath271 ( solid line in the plot ) , which can be converted into a power - law index with an intensity distribution of @xmath272 .",
    "the power - law index of dust temperature distribution is expected to depend on the opacity , @xmath273 , where @xmath274 @xcite .",
    "thus , the power - law index of the density distribution is estimated to be @xmath275 for @xmath276 ( see section [ subsec:3.2 ] ) , which shows a good agreement with the estimate from the combined @xmath78 data ( section [ subsubsec:4.1.1 ] ) .",
    "there are several uncertainties included in the derived density distribution . in this section ,",
    "we examine the effect of opacity , assumption of uniform temperature , index conversion from column density to volume density profiles , and @xmath78 fractional abundance .",
    "first , we investigate the effect of the optical depth of @xmath78 line emission , because the decrement of derived column densities in the inner radii might be due to larger optical depth within the @xmath277 beam .",
    "@xcite indicated that the @xmath78 emission is optically thin even at the center of an @xmath278 beam from the measured @xmath279 to @xmath78 peak intensity ratio of @xmath280 and expected abundance ratio , @xmath281 , of @xmath282 .",
    "furthermore , the integrated intensity ratio of @xmath279 to @xmath78 implies that @xmath78 emission should be optically thin at the center . according to figure 1 in @xcite , the line ratio actually ranges from @xmath283 to @xmath284 across the velocity",
    "; the lowest line ratio indicates that @xmath78 emission is marginally thick , @xmath285 at maximum in certain velocities .",
    "this opacity enhancement is limited only to a narrow velocity range , so it does not introduce a significant error when estimating the column density near the center , i.e. , the underestimate .",
    "therefore , the effect of the optical depth can not account for the turnover around the radius of @xmath286 .",
    "second , we assumed that the core has a uniform temperature distribution that does not have much effect on the estimate of the column density .",
    "if we adopt the temperature profile from @xcite , for example , then the difference in temperature between radii of @xmath187 and @xmath8 should be a factor of @xmath287 . from equation ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    ", the uncertainty of the column density estimate expected by this temperature variation could be derived as @xmath288 at most .",
    "third , the derivation of the density profile of the core from the column density distribution depends on the radial finiteness of the core traced by the @xmath78 molecular line emission . for a spherical core with a size of @xmath289 and a power - law density profile of @xmath290 ,",
    "the column density that is given by integrating the densities along the line of sight at the impact parameter @xmath291 can be expressed as @xmath292 where @xmath293 and the variable @xmath294 is an angle between a radial vector and the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , the coefficient of @xmath200 is also a function of @xmath291 so that the column density profile deviates from a power - law of the form @xmath295 . moreover , if the core has different power - law dependencies between the inner and outer regions , then the simple prediction of the column density profile in equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) is not exactly valid .",
    "figure [ fig:9 ] shows the column density profiles of cores that have power - law density distributions with a cutoff radius @xmath289 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the profiles for the predictions of @xmath296 . for the case of a single power - law density distribution of @xmath297",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:9](a ) , the resulting column density coincides well with the dependency of @xmath298 at radii smaller than @xmath299 .",
    "however , it tends to depart from the power - law dependency and become steeper with increasing radius .",
    "figure [ fig:9](b ) shows the column density profile for the core with density distributions of @xmath300 for @xmath301 and @xmath297 for @xmath302 .",
    "this plot demonstrates that the column density profile of a core that has inner and outer regions with different power - law density distributions can be estimated to be steeper than the simple prediction of @xmath295 .",
    "we examined the uncertainties caused by these effects when converting the column density profile into the density profile , and we found that the true density profile is likely to be shallower by @xmath303 at most in the power - law index than for our estimates .    finally , as for the abundance of @xmath78 , recent studies of chemical evolution in star - forming cores have shown that the abundance of @xmath304 , which is a daughter species of @xmath305 , decreases at radii that are smaller than the @xmath305 sublimation radius @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown that the abundance of @xmath304 at the inner radii increases with the evolution of core collapse after a central stellar object is born .",
    "@xcite simulated a large number of molecular line profiles from b335 using various physical models . by the use of a self - consistent chemical model with core evolution ,",
    "the result showed that the abundance of @xmath304 hardly changes along the core radius . the shallower profile at smaller radii can be affected by the radial distribution of the @xmath78 abundance , although it is not expected to be dominant .",
    "the possible effects of radial dependence in the @xmath78 abundance and the finite core radius oppose one another .",
    "it is difficult to estimate how they contribute to our data .",
    "nevertheless , by taking into account the agreement of the column density profiles in the inner region of the b335 core between the derivations from the combined @xmath78 and dust continuum data , we determine that the effects of variation in optical depth and radius dependence in the @xmath78 abundance are likely to be negligible .",
    "moreover , the agreement between the profile indices derived from our data with those from the extinction analysis of near - infrared data indicates that the effect of these uncertainties , especially in the temperature and fractional abundance of @xmath78 , is not very considerable . in other words ,",
    "our @xmath78 data well represent the column density structure of the core , which mostly ensures the validity of our analysis for the physics of star formation .",
    "we performed model calculations of the pv diagrams and investigated which model reproduces the observed signatures of the pv diagram in the @xmath78 line well . for comparison with the observed results ,",
    "the model calculations were performed with different radial distributions of the infalling velocities and also for three different assumed central stellar masses .",
    "we assume a contracting spherical star - forming core with rotation as described in detail below .",
    "most of the parameters for the calculations simulating pv diagrams were taken from our observational results and previous studies .",
    "the core has a size of @xmath8 and the radial density profile in equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) shows power - law dependencies ( @xmath264 ) of @xmath306 in the inner ( @xmath307 ) and @xmath308 in the outer ( @xmath309 ) regions .",
    "such a difference in power - law indices is naturally expected from the isothermal collapse model because of the boundary of the inner free - falling region and the outer region in which the condition at the stage of the formation of a central stellar object is expected to be conserved .",
    "the boundary radius is referred to as the infalling radius ( @xmath310 ) , and therefore our derived density profile indicates @xmath311 .",
    "we also introduced the rotational motion of the core .",
    "the inclination angle of the rotation axis from the plane of the sky should be considered because it affects the line - of - sight velocity of rotational motion .",
    "we assumed that the rotation axis corresponds to the outflow axis whose inclination angle for b335 was estimated to be @xmath312 @xcite , @xmath313 @xcite , and @xmath314 @xcite .",
    "we adopted an inclination angle of @xmath312 for the rotation axis in our calculations . in the free - fall region with @xmath315 , we adopted the increasing rotational velocity which is inversely proportional to the radius owing to the angular momentum conservation during collapse .",
    "such a velocity field in infalling envelopes was indeed suggested observationally ( e.g. , l1551-irs5 by * ? ? ?",
    "the overall velocity gradient from the 45 m telescope observations , @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) , can be regarded as the initial angular momentum of the core , which is still preserved in the outer radius of @xmath318 . for the thermal line broadening , we set the line - of - sight velocity width of @xmath319 for @xmath78 molecules at @xmath320 .",
    "we calculated radiative transfer equations to estimate the relative intensity distributions and verify the effect of optical depth .",
    "assuming a two - level state , the populations in rotational levels of an @xmath78 molecule were calculated using the einstein @xmath321 coefficient and the collisional rate coefficients with @xmath170 from and @xcite .",
    "the final model pv diagrams were smoothed with gaussian functions whose fwhms are the same as actual resolutions of the combined image for both the spatial and velocity directions .",
    "we conducted simulations by varying the parameters of the inward velocity in the outer region ( @xmath322 ) of the core , @xmath323 , and the mass of the central stellar object to compare with observational results .",
    "we adopted the inward velocities in the outer region of @xmath324 , @xmath39 , and @xmath325 .",
    "the central stellar mass ( @xmath326 ) for b335 was estimated in a wide range in previous studies , e.g. , @xcite estimated it to be @xmath327 while @xmath328 was suggested by @xcite . in our model calculations",
    ", we used three values of the central stellar mass : @xmath329 , @xmath330 , and @xmath331 .",
    "figure [ fig:10 ] shows the calculated pv diagrams perpendicular to the rotation axis passing through the core center .    as for",
    "the inward velocities in the outer region of the core , the calculated pv diagrams for @xmath324 well reproduce the features in the observed pv diagram .",
    "the inward velocity in the outer region affects the overall line width in the pv diagram .",
    "although the pv diagrams calculated with @xmath332 are also similar to the observed result , the overall velocity widths seem to be larger than that of the observed one .",
    "the simulated diagrams with @xmath333 undoubtedly disagree with the observation .",
    "we found that the central stellar mass mainly contributes line broadening at the core center , which means that the infalling motion is more dominant than the spin - up rotation owing to the conservation of angular momentum around the core center .",
    "for the diagrams with @xmath324 , it seems that line wings at the center position are not enough in the case of @xmath329 while they are excessive in the case of @xmath334 .",
    "consequently , we determine in our model calculations that the pv diagram with @xmath324 and @xmath335 well represents the observed pv diagram .",
    "the calculated model pv diagram with @xmath324 and @xmath335 shows that the peak is skewed toward the blueshifted velocity and has a shoulder in the profile around the systemic velocity at the center position .",
    "these features in the model diagram are due to the @xmath78 optical depth and are similar to the observational result .",
    "hence , the suggestion discussed in section [ subsubsec:4.1.3 ] that the @xmath156@xmath1 line is marginally optically thick is probably reasonable .",
    "in addition , we can obtain the radial distribution of the specific angular momentum from the profile of rotation velocity in the model calculations of pv diagrams .",
    "figure [ fig:11 ] shows the radial distribution of specific angular momentum in the model that well represents the observation : the case of @xmath324 and @xmath335 .",
    "we can see the spin - up rotation within the infall radius of @xmath311 as deviations from the solid - body rotation with an angular velocity of @xmath336 . in previous observational studies ,",
    "the specific angular momenta of the core and envelope in b335 have been measured at several radii from velocity gradients across the outflow axis .",
    "@xcite derived the specific angular momenta of @xmath337 at a radius of @xmath338 and @xmath339 at @xmath340 from velocity gradients seen in the @xmath341@xmath33 and @xmath342@xmath35 envelopes , respectively .",
    "they discussed the evolution of specific angular momentum , including the measurements by @xcite of @xmath343 at @xmath258 and @xmath344 at @xmath8 .",
    "these measurements are also indicated in figure [ fig:11 ] as open squares and open triangles .",
    "this plot shows that our model calculations successfully derived the radial distribution of the specific angular momentum consistent with measurements from previous observational studies .",
    "in particular , specific angular momenta that were recently estimated from high - resolution observations in submillimeter wavelengths at radii of @xmath340 and @xmath338 show good agreement with the results of our model calculations .",
    "the density and velocity structures of a collapsing molecular cloud core are crucial to distinguish theoretical models of gravitational collapse .",
    "we examine the observational results by comparing them with the key properties of the two star formation models , i.e. , the @xcite and larson  penston solutions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  lp solution  ) .",
    "although the shu and lp pictures of core contraction are similar in terms of the power - law dependencies of density distribution and inward motion , it is possible to distinguish between the two models by quantitative comparisons .",
    "the power - law dependency of the density profile in the b335 core qualitatively matches the similarity solutions for an isothermal spherical cloud in its post - protostar formation stage @xcite , which has also been demonstrated by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; i.e. , @xmath345 in the dynamical free - fall region and @xmath346 in the outer region where the condition at the protostar formation stage should be conserved . the absolute density of the core is one of the key parameters used to discriminate between isothermal collapse models .",
    "we derived the number density of the b335 core as @xmath347 at the radius of @xmath205 . in shu s inside - out picture ,",
    "the density distribution in the outer region of the core is expected to correspond to the singular isothermal sphere , @xmath348 . from this model ,",
    "we obtain @xmath349 with @xmath350 . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` runaway collapse '' of the lp solution during the core formation has a density that is @xmath351 times higher than that in shu s solution , so that we obtain @xmath352 at @xmath353 .",
    "our derived density is comparable to that predicted by shu s solution with a factor of @xmath354 , however , it is considerably smaller than that of the lp solution .",
    "the inward velocity in the outer region from our model calculations also supports shu s solution . as described above our model calculations of pv diagrams",
    "successfully explain the observed features within the uncertainties , in which the mass of the central stellar source and the inward velocity in the outer core region are estimated . here",
    ", we focus on the inward motion in the outer region , which is one of the key characteristics to distinguish the gravitational collapse models .",
    "the static outer region of the core ( @xmath355 ) represents the velocity structure of shu s solution . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations of isothermal collapse models , which have been conducted to compare with similarity solutions , have showed that the inward velocity in the runaway collapse phase is not a constant but a function of age and radius .",
    "these inward velocities can be observed as intermediate pictures between those of the lp and shu models , and are important characteristics of the collapse of an isothermal sphere .",
    "the infall velocity in the runaway collapse phase is determined by the initial ratio of gravitational force to pressure force @xcite .",
    "the cloud core that begins to collapse from a marginally unstable isothermal gas sphere has a subsonic inward velocity in the outer region .",
    "even from our model comparisons with the pv diagram of the observed data , we can not exactly clarify if the outer region of the core has a subsonic inward velocity .",
    "however , it is plausible that there is an inward velocity @xmath356 in the outer region , such as @xmath333 which represents lp solution , can be ruled out .",
    "consequently , we suggest that the b335 core has initiated its gravitational collapse from a quasi - static initial condition similar to shu s model . otherwise , it is also possible to explain our observed results by means of an isothermal collapse of a cloud core that has a mass slightly larger than the bonner ",
    "ebert mass @xcite . in shu",
    "s similarity solutions , an infalling radius provides a rough age of the cloud after a point source is formed at the core center , because the boundary between the infalling inner region and the outer region propagates outward as a rarefaction wave with a velocity of the isothermal sound speed . in our case",
    ", we take the turnover radius to be the infalling radius and obtain an age of @xmath357 which is comparable to the order of the age of the class 0 phase . adopting the mass infall rate predicted by shu s solution , @xmath358 , along with the estimated age",
    ", we obtain a central stellar mass of @xmath359 .",
    "the estimate of the central stellar mass from our model calculation is closer to the prediction from shu s solution than that from the lp model , which expects a 48 times higher mass infall rate .",
    "therefore , the above comparisons between our results and the theoretical models indicate that the picture of shu s model is more preferable than that of the lp solution for the b335 core .",
    "we presented a study of the dense molecular cloud core harboring the low - mass protostar , b335 in the @xmath360 molecular line emission using the nobeyama 45 m telescope and the nma .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "the single - dish observations revealed a dense core with a size of @xmath159 .",
    "our analysis using a combining technique of single - dish and interferometer data revealed the structure of the inner dense envelope within the core with a high spatial resolution of @xmath361 .",

    "we determined the radial column density profile of the b335 core and found a reliable difference between the power - law indices of the outer and inner regions of the dense core .",
    "the turnover radius is considered to be @xmath241 , which is consistent with the infalling radius estimated in previous work . our derived density profile , @xmath364 for @xmath365 and @xmath366 for @xmath367 ,",
    "is better explained , both qualitatively and quantitatively , in the picture of shu s self - similar solution than in that of the lp solution .",
    "the dense core shows a slight overall velocity gradient of @xmath7 over the scale of @xmath8 across the outflow axis .",
    "this velocity gradient is considered to represent a solid - body rotation and corresponds to an angular velocity of @xmath368 .",
    "our combined image also revealed detailed velocity structures in the dense core with a high resolution .",
    "the velocity structure of the b335 core can be well explained in terms of the collapse of an isothermal sphere , in which the core has an inner free - fall region and an outer region preserving the condition at the stage of protostar formation .",

    "the model calculations successfully reproduce observational results , while suggesting a central stellar mass of @xmath369 and a small inward velocity of @xmath370 in the outer region of the core @xmath11 .",
    "quantitative comparisons of density and velocity structures from the observational results with theoretical models show an agreement with shu s quasi - static inside - out star formation .",
    "furthermore , it is possible for the outer region of the b335 core to have a subsonic inward velocity .",
