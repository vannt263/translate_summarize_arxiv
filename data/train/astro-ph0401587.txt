    "young clusters are natural laboratories for the study of various issues related to star formation processes , e.g. , the initial mass function ( imf ) , duration of star formation etc . in recent years , some remote young clusters have been studied using @xmath0 ccd observations ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these observations were used for the construction of color - color diagrams , color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and luminosity functions ( lfs ) .",
    "these diagrams were used for the determination of cluster reddening , distance and age while the lfs were transformed to stellar mass spectrum , which can be identified with the imf for young ( age @xmath1 100 myr ) star clusters . in these conventional studies of young star clusters , cluster age , lfs and mfs could not be determined accurately due to reasons discussed below .",
    "firstly , for reliable separation of cluster members from the foreground and background field stars present in the direction of distant ( @xmath2 kpc ) clusters , accurate kinematic ( proper motion and/or radial velocity ) measurements are essential . unfortunately , even present day most accurate hipparcos proper motion data ( available for brightest @xmath3 mag stars only ) are not sufficient for this purpose . in such circumstances the field star contamination is removed statistically by observing comparison areas ( blank fields ) adjacent to the cluster field .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in most cases of the conventional general - purpose ccd photometry , which are not specially intended to e.g. the imf study , such regions are not observed , and hence even statistical means of the data refining could not be used .",
    "this leads to a loss of information suitable otherwise for the lf construction .",
    "the other problem in the cmds of young star cluster is the precise determination of the main sequence ( ms ) turn off point , which is used for age determination , since for young clusters due to their small age , the upper ms is practically unevolved .",
    "consequently , it becomes difficult to evaluate the accurate cluster age , and instead an upper estimate of the cluster age is provided .",
    "the difficulty is further increased by effects like stellar rotation and binarity , and by the morphology of the upper ms , which is practically vertical for early type stars in the colours @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 .",
    "these problems can be avoided if the cluster age is estimated using the location of the ms turn on point , the place where pre - ms stars join the ms in the cluster cmd .",
    "for a young coeval cluster this point resides about 7 mag fainter the brightest termination point of the ms . as a result of the deep ccd observations of the clusters ,",
    "this region can be seen in the cmd , and hence is available for the analysis .",
    "many of the above effects ( except that of unresolved binaries ) are much weaker in the turn - on point region , which makes the turn - on dating method to be more attractive than the turn off one .",
    "there are , however , practical problems in locating the turn - on point e.g. , presence of strong field star contamination hides it more strongly than the brightest ms .",
    "the other limitation of the turn - on method is cluster age .",
    "as shown by evolutionary calculations , only for extremely young clusters with ages of order of a few myr , the pre - ms branch is raised sufficiently above the zams and could be easily recognized in the cmd . for older clusters the pre - ms branch deviation from the zams diminishes with increasing age and could be seen better as a detail of the lf ( as it is discussed in sec .  [ the_sec ] ) . at cluster ages exceeding that of the pleiades ,",
    "the pre - ms branch could not be identified with confidence both in the cmd and in the lf and the turn on method can not be applied ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other related issue is the fine structure of the stellar lf , located in the vicinity of the ms turn on point , which can mask the imf shape if one does not take it into account .",
    "this feature can produce a false flattening or even depletion in the lf , which are frequently considered as an evidence of the flattening / turning over of the imf ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "this in turn might have an important consequence with respect to the imf universality and other similar issues . since luminosity function of the turn on point depends on cluster age ,",
    "the position of the lf detail also varies with time , and may be used as a kind of a standard candle for age determination from the lf analysis @xcite .",
    "thus , the ms turn on region of young cluster cmds is very important for cluster dating , or should be taken into account when one is analyzing the lf .",
    "it can be easily identified , however , only in the case of a few selected clusters .",
    "the well known examples of such clusters are ngc  2264 , ngc  6530 , onc , and some others .",
    "normally young and especially remote clusters , which are buried in rich foreground / background show , neither distinct turn ons nor pms branches .",
    "the aim of present study is to reveal the ms turn on point information hidden in the existing ccd observational data of 6 young open cluster using a new approach , which does not require observations of blank fields .",
    "it should be noted , that these clusters were subject of a conventional study , and many of them already have age and imf determination . unlike these studies , we will not convert observed lf to the imf , but in order to avoid the above mentioned problems , we will construct theoretical lf , which should properly reflect the behavior of the observed ones in the vicinity of the ms turn on point . wherever the field star contaminations could not be determined using the observations of an offset field region ,",
    "they are estimated using galactic model for star counts for the surroundings of the cluster under study .",
    "then the theoretical lf will be fitted to the observations by varying the star formation parameters describing actual stellar population ( cluster age , star formation duration , imf slope , a percentage of observed field stars ) . considering its success",
    ", we hope that this approach can also be implemented to the other young open clusters having similar or more deep ccd data , which become presently available ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in section  [ the_sec ] we detail theoretical approach to lf of a young cluster and consider its fine structure in the context of current study . in the sec .",
    "[ obs_sec ] , we summarize the data used in the present work .",
    "[ lf_sec ] describes construction of the observed and theoretical lfs .",
    "we consider here the major effects which should be taken into consideration , define the model of cluster population and its parameters , and describe the fitting procedure . in sec .",

    "since stellar mass @xmath7 can be directly measured in very rare and specific cases , the imf is not observed directly , but is converted from the observed distribution of stars over their absolute magnitudes @xmath8 , called lf @xmath9 . for a cluster of age @xmath10 ( in years throughout the paper",
    "if not mentioned otherwise ) , the lf @xmath11 is related to the imf @xmath12 via time - dependent mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) @xmath13 as    @xmath14)\\times\\left|\\frac{d\\log m}{dm}\\right|_t.\\label{lfdef_eqn}\\ ] ]    since cluster stars evolve off or approach to the ms with a rate which is dependent on their mass , apart from their stay on the ms , the cluster mlr should also evolve with time , being different at every moment from the standard one ( usually adopted to be the mlr of the ms stars ) .",
    "this deviation is especially strong for red giant and pre - ms stars .",
    "besides , the `` instant '' mlr has a definite fine structure due to presence of quasi - horizontal post - ms and pre - ms portions of corresponding isochrone .",
    "the structure itself is not too prominent to influence the lf , but it produces bumps and dips in the mlr derivative , and hence in the lf .",
    "the strongest fluctuation of the derivative occurs near the ms turn off point , but due to the small number of stars observed there they could not be easily distinguished from statistical fluctuations of the lf .",
    "in contrast , in the vicinity of ms turn on point , a sufficient number of stars coupled with strong mlr derivative bumping produce a feature , which can be observed in lfs of star clusters , which are young enough to display a branch of pre - ms stars .",
    "this detail was called by @xcite as h - feature , as it appears at the location , where the hydrogen burning starts in the cores of the pre - ms stars .    in order to get an idea on general structure of the lfs of young star clusters and their relation to main evolutionary stages of stars , we show in fig.[cmdlf_fig ] the cmd",
    "together with an isochrone of @xmath15 , and corresponding lf constructed according to eq .",
    "( [ lfdef_eqn ] ) with help of salpeter imf ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the isochrone was constructed from a set of stellar models described in sec .",
    "[ tlf_sec ] .",
    "our calculations show , that in general this behavior of the lf does not differ for various sets of models , but details ( the size and amplitude of the lf fragments ) may be somewhat different .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ cmdlf_fig ] for young clusters the lf is non monotonic even for monotonic imf , and consists of a number of monotonic portions related to different evolutionary stages .",
    "comparison with evolutionary tracks shows that segment ( 0,1 ) of the lf corresponds to convective portion of a pre - ms track , segment ( 1,2 ) to radiative one , ( 2,3 ) can be identified with ms turn on point in the cmd , and segment ( 3,4 ) belongs to the main sequence . due to non - monotonic behavior of the isochrone",
    "near ms turn on point , the segment ( 2,3 ) is in fact a superposition of ms and pre - ms stellar evolutionary stages and pure ms starts at somewhat brighter magnitudes .",
    "the last segment ( 4,5 ) corresponds to post - ms stages of stellar evolution .",
    "we call hereafter for convenience purposes segment ( 1,2 ) as the lf h - dip , and segment ( 2,3 ) as lf h - maximum . for comparison in fig .",
    "[ cmdlf_fig ] , we show position of zams models of @xcite , and zams - lf constructed from these models .",

    "the value of @xmath24 , representing duration since formation of first stars , could be regarded as the cluster age .    the mass  absolute magnitude relation @xmath28 and its derivative were calculated along the isochrone of age @xmath10 using a cubic spline interpolation .",

    "since the clusters reside at different distances from the sun , the stars of ngc  4609 should be shifted with respect to that of hogg  15 by the difference of cluster apparent distance moduli @xmath67 . since @xmath45 of the ngc  4609 according to lgm2.2 is equal to @xmath68 mag the value of @xmath67 is taken to be equal to @xmath69 mag . due to small fraction of ngc  4609 stars projected on the hogg  15 area ( about 15% of hogg  15 population according to sec .",
    "[ ngb_sec ] ) the specific shape of the corresponding mass spectrum is not important and we assume that it follows salpeter law .",

    "can see from table  [ reslt_tab ] , taking into account population of ngc  4609 does not strongly change cluster parameters ( except the age spread ) , but considerably improves agreement between theoretical and observed parameters notably reducing @xmath50 parameter .",
    "[ cmd_fig ] shows that ages @xmath71 derived from the lf fitting are in good agreement with cluster cmd .",
    "the observed cluster lf @xmath59 also demonstrates a high degree of conformity with composite theoretical lf .",
    "a deep and narrow gap of @xmath59 at about @xmath72 mag shows that the derived input of field stars @xmath44 is somewhat overestimated .",
    "as shown in table  [ reslt_tab ] , hogg  15 is one of the two clusters in our sample , where considerable ( although quite uncertain ) age spread of @xmath73 is detected . this value , however , is reduced to the insignificant value of @xmath74 , which is common to the whole sample , if one takes into account the contamination from ngc  4609 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the age spread in hogg  15 is introduced mainly due to admixture of field and overlapping neighbor stars , and consider the cluster parameters as derived for the hogg  15@xmath20 case .",
    "hogg  15 is the youngest cluster of our sample , with an age of 4 myr .",
    "how does this value compare with the earlier published values ?",
    "for the first time , the age of hogg  15 was estimated by @xcite as 8 myr . according to @xcite",
    "the age is 10 myr .",
    "recent values come generally from isochrone fitting of the upper ms : lgm2.2 define it as @xmath75 myr , @xcite provide age estimate of @xmath76 myr , @xcite , who found initially it as 300 myr , later reduced this unusually high value to @xmath77 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "technique of matching integrated theoretical and observed spectra of the cluster lead @xcite to the age values @xmath78 myr or 30 myr . since ms turn off ages are biased toward higher values , our age estimate , based on ms turn on point technique , is in fact the lowest one .",
    "note , however , that the majority of the above mentioned values agree with the present one within their accuracy .",
    "the imf slope was determined for hogg  15 stars by @xcite , who find it to be equal @xmath79 , which again coincides with the present result .",
    "it can be seen from the cmd that the regular cluster sequences are embedded in a `` cloud '' of presumably field stars .",
    "the astrometric members also show definite spread around the ms turn off point",
    ". it may be that some of them are co - moving field stars .",
    "the ms turn on point can be detected somewhere between @xmath80 and 1.5 mag .",
    "the apparent lf @xmath39 shows a broad plateau between @xmath81 and 3 mag , with weak maximum at @xmath82 mag .",
    "as indicated by galactic model star counts , it should be formed mostly by field stars .",
    "the sample demonstrates certain incompleteness below the maximum , where @xmath39 instead of steady increase slowly falls down .",

    "[ fld_sec ] , [ ngb_sec ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the central part of ngc  2384 can be regarded as relatively free from the ngc 2383 influence .",
    "therefore we start this section with discussion of ngc  2384 results .",
    "the cmd of ngc  2384 in its lower part is very fuzzy , while the ms part of the diagram is well defined . @xcite",
    "even assume that stars fainter than @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) mag are mainly field stars , as can be seen from the fig .",
    "[ cmd_fig ] .",
    "nevertheless , a certain fraction of cluster members is observed even at faintest magnitudes .",
    "these are pre - ms stars , forming the upper bound of the observed sequence at @xmath114 mag .",
    "in contrast to other clusters the cmd of ngc  2384 does not display an extended halo of field stars , where cluster ms- and pre - ms sequences are embedded .",
    "field stars ( presumably giants and late type dwarfs ) form a compact clump in the bottom of the diagram , with @xmath115 mag and @xmath116 mag , leaving hertzsprung gap to be unoccupied .",
    "the ms turn on point in the cmd is less certain than for other clusters .",
    "if one correlates cluster cmd with the morphology of the observed lf one should detect it around @xmath117 mag , where cluster ms - stars certainly cease to appear , and simultaneously a local detail , resembling the h - feature appears in the observed lf .",
    "one can observe , however , that a few of the pre - ms stars do appear in the cmd at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath118 mag ) .",
    "their extension forms an upper bound of a broad pre - ms branch , extending down to the limit of observations .",
    "the regularity of this feature implies , that it is not a random pattern of field stars",
    ". they would be rather unresolved pre - ms binaries , or the youngest generation of ngc  2384 stars .",
    "note , however , that this brighter position of the ms turn on point does not produce anything resembling the h - maximum , expected to be located near this point ( see sec .",
    "[ the_sec ] ) .",
    "the lf of ngc  2384 demonstrates irregular behavior , and its agreement with theoretical lf is worse in comparison to the other clusters under study .",
    "this is confirmed statistically as the @xmath50 value is highest for this cluster ( except hogg  15 case with no correction for contamination by ngc  4609 ) .",
    "one can mention an excess of observed number of massive stars ( @xmath119 mag ) , and a deficiency of medium - mass stars ( @xmath120 mag ) with respect to theoretical lf @xmath60 . also lf - detail , which we identify with the h - feature",
    "is poorly developed ; the observed h - dip is narrower , than the theoretical one .",
    "this behavior is in conformity with mass segregation scenario in the case if the observed frame covers the central part of the cluster only .",
    "the derived slope of the mass function is similar to values found by @xcite for central parts of rich lmc clusters ngc  1805 and ngc  1818 .",
    "the lf irregularity could be attributed then to incomplete member statistics .",
    "the higher extent of the cluster comparing to the observed frame naturally explains other peculiarities of ngc  2383/4 pair like presence of early type stars in the ngc  2383 field and existence of underdeveloped h - feature in its lf ( see below ) , or weak excess of bright stars in the neighboring blank field ( see .",
    "[ fld_sec ] ) .",
    "the stability of ngc  2384 parameters against contaminating effect of ngc  2383 was checked using data from the part of ngc  2384 frame , located outside ngc  2383 area ( see fig .",
    "[ cufmap_fig ] ) . as one can see from table  [ reslt_tab ] , there is no difference between derived parameters of ngc  2384 in both cases .",
    "thus we can regard the influence of ngc  2383 member contamination on the derived parameters of ngc  2384 to be negligible .",
    "color magnitude diagram of ngc  2383 is more populated than that of the neighboring ngc  2384 .",
    "there is a well defined evolved portion of the ms compatible with cluster age @xmath121 , which is in agreement with an estimate of @xmath122 by @xcite and differs from the ages @xmath123 and 7.17 derived by @xcite and lgm2.2 respectively .",
    "this contradiction arises due to the presence of bright ascc-2.5 kinematic members with ages of a few tens of myr .",
    "the ms turn on point , corresponding to this younger age can not be easily identified in the cmd .",
    "nevertheless the lf indicates presence of the h - detail even in the apparent lf @xmath39 . the ms - band at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath124 mag ) is widened and unlike the other clusters studied here , it is not due to field giants extending the ms from the side of fainter magnitudes , but it is due to bright stars forming the high luminosity envelope of the ms .    in the corrected lf @xmath59 , the h - feature becomes more pronounced , leaving the h - dip however to be somewhat underdeveloped ( more shallow and narrow than in the corresponding theoretical lf ) .",
    "the cluster age derived from the lf fitting corresponds to lower age estimation coming from the brightest ms stars .",
    "the value of @xmath50 indicates that the lf fit is more reliable , than in the case of ngc  2384 .",
    "note the unusually steep value of the imf slope @xmath31 = 2.2 , estimated for this cluster . in spite of formally satisfactory results of the lf fitting",
    "there are several points , indicating that ngc  2383 carries signs of a dual nature , which were not taken into consideration .",
    "for example , evolved upper ms indicates that ngc  2383 is about 300 myr old ( see fig .",
    "[ cmd_fig ] ) , while lf indicates its age close to that of ngc  2384 . the relatively young age of ngc  2383 is also supported by the presence of bright ms kinematic members .",
    "possibly this is the main reason for assigning younger age to the cluster by @xcite and lgm2.2 .",
    "this confusion can be removed with the help of a model of an overlapping neighbor , with the only difference from the case of hogg  15 , that in this case degree of contamination with ngc  2384 stars is higher ( see sec .",
    "[ ngb_sec ] ) .",
    "this is also supported by independent data of the ascc-2.5 , which indicates , that these clusters are located close not only in the sky , but also have similar proper motions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so a probable proper motion member of one cluster can also well belong to the other , and the brightest kinematic members of ngc  2383 could be actually projected members of ngc  2384 .",
    "this can also be supported by the fact that numerous ms - stars of ngc  2383 forming upper envelope at @xmath125 mag , could be actually pre - ms stars of ngc  2384 .",
    "apart from coincidence with positions of corresponding isochrones in the cmd this idea is also supported by spatial distribution of these stars .",
    "they tend to be located in ngc  2383 frame within circle of its neighbor .",
    "the number of these stars is compatible with the degree of contamination derived from stellar counts and they might be responsible for steeper imf slope found for ngc  2383 , when neglecting influence of ngc  2384 .    in order to take into account contamination from the overlapping cluster theoretical lf of ngc  2383 , @xmath21 was composed of two populations belonging to both clusters . unlike to the case of hogg  15 , ngc  2383 and ngc  2384 reside at the same distance within the errors ( @xmath126 mag ) .",
    "so no correction is required for the lf magnitude scale while constructing the composed theoretical lf .",
    "we assume , that the mass spectrum of ngc  2384 stars does not vary with location and the case of ngc  2384@xmath19 in table  [ reslt_tab ] can be considered as its representative .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 were also taken from the table  [ reslt_tab ] . since",
    "no developed h - feature exists in the lf at @xmath127300 myr we were forced to use the lf of ngc  2383 in a customary , way i.e. for determination of @xmath31 and @xmath44 parameters .",
    "cluster age was found from the ms turn off point and fine tuned to satisfy the @xmath50-test .",
    "the lowest @xmath50-value was achieved at @xmath128 , which is somewhat less than isochronic age of @xmath129 ( fig .",
    "[ cmd_fig ] ) , determined from the post - ms isochrone fitting . due to above mentioned reasons we regard this disagreement as insignificant and show in the table  [ reslt_tab ] the turn - off age .",
    "the best - fit composite lf for the case ngc  2383@xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lf_fig ] with solid curve , while the contaminating model lf of the ngc  2384 is shown with the dash - dotted curve .",
    "as one can see from the table  [ reslt_tab ] , the proposed model provides less accurate fit of theoretical lf to observed lf than the previous one .",
    "on the other hand , it harmonises the full observation scope ( star counts , cluster cmds and lfs ) . as a result ,",
    "with the age determined from the ms turn off point calibration , the imf slope has been reduced to the value close to the salpeter s one with the value of @xmath44 almost unchanged .    in the light of above discussions , it is not surprising that the cluster parameters derived in the present study are in good agreement with those derived in the original paper by @xcite .",
    "for example , our values of @xmath31 practically coincide with those of @xcite , who found @xmath130 for ngc  2383 and @xmath131 for ngc  2384 .",
    "similarly , in agreement with @xcite , we regard that ngc  2383 ages listed by @xcite as 2541 myr or by lgm2.2 as 16 myr are underestimated , while the ngc  2384 ages ( 110 myr according to @xcite and @xmath132 myr according to lgm2.2 ) are in fair agreement with our result .",
    "however , again the age of ngc  2384 derived from lf - fitting is lower than that derived by @xcite from the upper part of the ms .",
    "@xcite conclude that in spite of their spatial proximity clusters ngc  2383/2384 do not constitute a physical pair in the sense of common origin .",
    "present study not only supports this point but makes it more stronger . in spite of the fact that both clusters do overlap in the plane of sky ,",
    "reside approximately at the same distance from the sun , and have similar proper motions , they are very different in all other respects e.g. cluster geometry , morphology , environment , stellar contents , and age and can not be regarded as twins .",
    "the major aim of the present study was to elaborate tools , which provide comprehensive investigation of remote young open star clusters having accurate ccd - photometry .",
    "the effort was focused on revealing of the main sequence turn - on areas , important both from the point of young cluster dating and from the luminosity and mass function analysis . to enable the statistical selection of cluster members for vast set of open cluster ccd observations with no data on adjacent blank fields , and thus , to involve them to luminosity and mass functions studies we proposed a new approach to field star removing technique based on using of galactic disk star count model .",
    "as we found , due to high confidence in interstellar extinction determination , open clusters are especially suitable objects for this technique , providing selection results at least of the same quality level as the standard method of the blank field does",
    ". the proposed approach could be especially valuable for deep observations of young clusters , planned to be observed in the frame of present - day surveys ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which are able not only to reach turn - on regions of selected young clusters , but also reveal complete h - details down to convective portions of luminosity functions .",
    "the main conclusion from the present study of the 6 such clusters residing at helio - centric distances of 24 kpc is that their ccd observations coupled with the galaxy model star counts , wide area statistics provided by all sky catalogues , and theoretical lfs fitted to the observations are sufficient to study their population , construction of the detailed luminosity and mass functions , and age , provided the photometry is deep enough to reach the lf h - feature .",
    "the direct comparison of observed and theoretical lfs instead of converting them to stellar mass spectra is of principle importance in this approach .",
    "it provides a standard candle , which can be used for a reliable cluster dating .",
    "this is very difficult otherwise , since the upper ms of young clusters usually implemented for this aim , are too steep , and degree of stellar evolution is as a rule insignificant to provide reliable cluster ages .",
    "in fact it just provides an upper estimates for the cluster age .",
    "the main conclusions can be written as :    * contamination of cluster members with field stars is the most important factor influencing the lower part of cluster cmd and lf .",
    "for the clusters under study , field star contamination varies in the range of 2050% .",
    "* the overlapping clusters may considerably distort the observed lfs .",
    "the `` neighbor '' contamination , in addition to field stars , is equal to 14% in the case of hogg  15 and to 24% in the case of ngc  2383 . * the lf h - feature was found well beyond statistical noise in all the clusters under study .",
    "for most of the clusters its location agrees well with the theoretical prediction .",
    "we believe , that in the case of ngc  2384 , where h - feature displays underdeveloped structure , this can be explained by complexity of the area , and spatial incompleteness of the data .",
    "the false h - feature observed in ngc  2383 , which certainly is too old to demonstrate it , is due to contamination of the cluster field with ngc  2384 stars .",
    "* cluster ages derived in the present study are as a rule several times lower than those determined from the fitting of the theoretical isochrones to the turn off parts of the ms .",
    "we believe , that our ages are more accurate , than those derived from the upper ms .",
    "note that although we used continuous star formation model , the derived durations of star formation events are only insignificantly differ from zero .",
    "* stellar mass spectra of studied clusters are well represented with a power law with slopes , which as a rule agree with salpeter value , within errors .",
    "one should keep in mind however , that since the observed data concerns the central parts of clusters , the derived mass spectra might be different from the imf due to mass segregation effect .",
    "the unusually flat mass function of ngc  2384 can be treated e.g. as an indirect evidence of higher extent of this cluster and of presence of mass segregation effect .",
