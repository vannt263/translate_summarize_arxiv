    "the study of superfluids has revealed a cornucopia of fascinating phenomena as well as important concepts in the physics of condensed matter .",
    "interesting phenomena related to superfluidity , such as phase slips and a persistent current , continue as topics of interest  @xcite despite their long history of investigation .",
    "since one notable feature is dissipationless flow below a threshold , the stability of superfluids is a very important issue .",
    "although the landau criterion provides the critical velocity and predicts that an ideal bose gas is an unstable superfluid , many experimental results  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite have shown that the critical velocity is actually smaller than landau s critical velocity .",
    "( in cases where impurities are comparable in size to atoms , the critical velocity approaches landau s critical velocity  @xcite . )",
    "as is well known , the dissipation of superfluids at a smaller velocity than landau s critical velocity is caused by emissions of phase defects , such as quantized vortices and solitons .",
    "since the landau criterion is based on the galilean transformation , this criterion is applicable only to uniform systems .",
    "we thus need a stability condition for a superfluid flowing through an obstacle , in which case the translation invariance is broken .",
    "a feature of superfluids is the suppression of the density fluctuation .",
    "although the compressibility diverges in an ideal bose gas , it does not diverge in a bose gas with a repulsive interaction .",
    "when we observe a two - body distribution function , the ideal bose gas exhibits spatial density fluctuations and tends to form particle clusters due to the bose statistics alone  @xcite . on the other hand , a bose gas with a repulsive interaction exhibits the `` density homogenization '' effect  @xcite and its density fluctuations",
    "are suppressed in the long - wavelength regime  @xcite . in the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "@xcite , this homogenization effect may be included through the nonlinear effect on the macroscopic wave function  @xcite .",
    "when the dissipation occurs in the superfluid above a threshold , emergent phase defects such as quantized vortices and solitons are often featured , but the density also fluctuates .",
    "in fact , the phase and density are canonical variables .",
    "thus , we expect that the suppression of density fluctuations with respect to a perturbation characterizes the stability of superfluids . on the basis of this idea",
    ", we recently proposed a stability criterion hypothesis based on the local density spectral function @xmath0 or the autocorrelation function @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the former function is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ground state vector or a stable superflow state vector with the energy @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the density fluctuation operator .",
    "( @xmath13 is a state vector of an excited state @xmath14 with the energy @xmath15 . )",
    "the autocorrelation function is the fourier transform of this function @xmath16 when a superflow current is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the critical current , the local density spectral function in a @xmath2-dimensional system behaves as @xmath19 and the autocorrelation function behaves as @xmath20 with @xmath7 .",
    "we have gathered only a few pieces of evidence for this criterion hypothesis  @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the validity of the criterion by calculating the density spectral function not only for a one - dimensional repulsive potential barrier , but also for a one - dimensional attractive external potential using the tunneling solutions of bogoliubov theory . in the latter case , the critical current @xmath18 is equal to landau s critical current .",
    "the density spectral function is enhanced at @xmath21 in the low - energy regime far from the attractive potential ; this is marked contrast to the case with the repulsive potential barrier .",
    "we also numerically demonstrate the validity of ( [ eq3 ] ) in the repulsive potential barrier case .",
    "we also discuss and numerically evaluate the density spectral function with the use of an orthogonal basis in the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "an orthogonal basis is generally employed to calculate the spectral function , and tunneling solutions do not always satisfy the bogoliubov orthonormalization condition .",
    "the tunneling solutions far from the potential barrier consist of the superposition of plane waves that satisfy the bogoliubov normalization condition in the momentum space .",
    "even if we use the orthogonal set , the low - energy behavior of the local density spectral function is qualitatively unchanged .",

    ", we calculate the local density spectral function in the presence of the one - dimensional external potential .",
    "we calculate the density spectral function in a uniform system using bogoliubov theory , and discuss the landau instability in section  [ secvi ] .",
    "section  [ secvii ] also examines the density spectral function in feynman s single - mode approximation and for an ideal bose gas .",
    "based on the results described in these sections , in section  [ secviii ] , we discuss the validity of the stability criterion hypothesis for superfluids in light of the density spectral function .",
    "we highlight results that were not addressed in the earlier short reports  @xcite : ( i ) the comparative study of the local density spectral function for the repulsive / attractive potential barrier ( section  [ secv ] ) , ( ii ) the explicit formulas of the local density spectral function in the low - energy regime for the repulsive potential barrier case , obtained from the tunneling solutions at the critical current ( section  [ secv ] ) , ( iii ) the spectral function calculated with an orthogonal basis , and a comparative study between this result and the spectral function obtained from the tunneling solutions ( section  [ secv ] ) , ( iv ) the numerically - calculated density spectral function in the uniform system using bogoliubov theory ( section  [ secvi ] ) , ( v ) the application of the stability criterion hypothesis to an ideal bose gas ( sections  [ secvii ] and  [ secviii ] ) , and ( vi ) numerical evidence for the hypothesis in terms of the autocorrelation function ( section  [ secviii ] ) .",
