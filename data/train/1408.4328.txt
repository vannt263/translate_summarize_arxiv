    "dark matter is a key ingredient of any viable cosmological model with a general relativity ( gr ) based description for gravity .",
    "its clustering patterns are of fundamental importance to determine the observed baryonic large scale structure of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the standard description for the dark matter dynamics in the universe consists in assuming a pressureless fluid @xmath0 which fells only indirectly ( via the gravitational pontential ) the presence of other components like , for instance , photons , neutrinos , dark energy and baryons .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that dark matter behaves as a perfect fluid described by the collisionless boltzmann equation",
    ". therefore , direct interactions with other species are in principle avoided .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe is another issue not yet properly understood .",
    "this phenomena is commonly associated to a cosmological constant @xmath1 which seems to be the ideal dark energy candidate .",
    "in fact , there are also other candidates for the dark energy sector which are based on either exotic fluids or scalar fields .",
    "however , no matter the actual nature of dark matter or dark energy , a primary approach in cosmology relies on the assumption that these dark components coexist without interacting directly to each other .    due to our ignorance about the physics behind the dark components , which are the two main building blocks of modern cosmology , many possibilities about",
    "their dynamics have appeared in the literature . a notable",
    "one is the possibility that they indeed do interact in an effective way exchanging energy @xcite .",
    "many interacting cosmological scenarios have been studied in the last years . in general , the interacting term @xmath2 is usually imposed into the dynamics by hand , i.e. , it is said that the system dark matter plus dark energy obeys the energy balances @xmath3 it is worth noting that the sum of these equations correspond to a conserved dark energy sector without the interacting term .",
    "one usually adopts phenomenological choices for @xmath2 leaving the model without an explanation for the physical mechanism which drives the interaction .    for general fluids in which the interaction of their particles with the medium is relevant",
    "the boltzmann equation can be replaced by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "mathematically , this implies in assuming a non - zero collision term in the right hand side of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the generalization of the fokker - planck equation on the @xmath4 curved spacetime is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the four - momentum , @xmath7 the distribution function and @xmath8 is the positive coefficient of matter velocity diffusion .",
    "the standard case is fully recovered when @xmath9 .",
    "matter diffusion is a physical phenomena which can take place in general relativistic universes @xcite .",
    "as argued in @xcite the matter diffusion present in a homogeneous and isotropic expansion - the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( frlw ) universe - can therefore be the physical mechanism behind the interaction within the dark sector .    in ref .",
    "@xcite upper bounds on the magnitude of the diffusion @xmath8 have been obtained using observational data .",
    "background constraints from supernovae ia , baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the differential age of galaxies are at least one order of magnitude weaker than a first order analysis , i.e. , using the cosmic microwave anisotropy spectrum and the matter power spectrum .",
    "the latter tests make use of the linear cosmological perturbation theory which probes the evolution of the density fluctuations that give rise to the large scale structure .    in this paper",
    "we go further in the study of the perturbative behaviour of the diffusion model .",
    "we investigate the non - linear stage of the perturbations , by calculating the impact of the diffusion process - here expressed by the value of @xmath8 - on the spherical collapse .",
    "besides , we employ the top - hat approach since no pressure gradients are present in our model .    in the next section",
    "we describe in more detail the relativistic diffusion theory and present the equations for the flrw background .",
    "section iii is devoted to the physics and equations of the spherical collapse where we present our results for the evolution of the decoupled collapsed region .",
    "the final section is devoted to our concluding remarks .",
    "as a consequence of ( [ fp4d ] ) and being @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively the energy - momentum tensor and the current density of some matter distribution in a spacetime @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the conserved particle number , matter is said to undergo _ microscopic _ ( or molecular ) velocity diffusion if the following kinetic equations hold    @xmath14    @xmath15    equation ( [ consj ] ) assures the 4-current conservation as usual , i.e. , there is no particle creation in the model .",
    "however , equation ( [ diffusion ] ) modifies the standard energy - momentum balance .",
    "the formulation of general relativistic ( gr ) field equations in this new scenario has to be adapted to the condition ( [ diffusion ] ) . in order to keep the bianchi identities ( @xmath16 )",
    "a trivial possibility is to modify einstein s equation as @xmath17 where we have included a cosmological field @xmath18 which obeys to @xmath19 note we have used used units @xmath20 .    as usual , @xmath21 denotes the ricci curvature of the metric @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "is the _ macroscopic _ diffusion equation .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the diffusion constant . the value @xmath8 measures the energy transferred from the scalar field to the matter per unit of time due to diffusion .",
    "the fluid correspondence of the diffusion dynamics can be found by projecting the energy - momentum tensor in the direction of @xmath25 and onto the hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath25 . with this procedure",
    "we obtain the energy balance and the euler equation , respectively ,    @xmath26    @xmath27    a viable cosmological model in which dark matter undergoes diffusion in interaction with a dark energy solvent field @xmath18 has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the so called @xmath18cdm model .    for the @xmath18cdm model",
    "the energy balances for the matter and the @xmath18 field are described by the system @xmath28 @xmath29 in a dimensionless form these equations read @xmath30 @xmath31 where the redshift is written in terms of the scale factor as @xmath32 .",
    "we have redefined the diffusion constant to dimensionless units @xmath33 . the dimensionless expasion factor @xmath34",
    "( subscript @xmath35 denotes today s values ) reads @xmath36 the baryoninc component obeys separately to the conservation equation for pressureless fluids which results in @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 the @xmath18 field remains constant in time and the solution is given by the @xmath1cdm model : @xmath39",
    "our goal here is to obtain the most general perturbed equations for the evolution of an overdense spherical region collapsing in an expanding universe .",
    "we follow refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us first define basic quantities .",
    "note that the spherical collapse happens within the newtonian framework .",
    "for the collapsed region ( superscript @xmath40 ) one can write @xmath41    the velocity of the collapsed region @xmath42 can be seen as the balance between the background expansion and the peculiar motion .    the effective expansion rate of the collapsed region is written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 the peculiar velocity field .    for the collapsing region one",
    "has to assure energy conservation .",
    "therefore , each component @xmath46 , possessing an equation of state @xmath47 , obeys separately an equation of the type    @xmath48\\frac{\\theta}{a}\\ ] ]    where the energy density contrast is defined as    @xmath49    and the effective speed of sound is computed following @xmath50 .",
    "the dynamics of the perturbed region will be governed by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath51 note that the perturbation of the @xmath18 field contributes with a positive sign in the right hand side of this equation in opposition to standard matter fluids .",
    "let us in a first moment impose a restriction to our model assuming that @xmath18 , which acts as a solvent field , is able neither to cluster nor contribute to form structures , i.e. , we treat it as a geometric contribution to the background expansion only .",
    "therefore , we set by hand @xmath52 in this analysis .",
    "note that most of the studies in the literature also neglect the importance of the dark energy fluctuations to the clustering process .",
    "however , a recent analysis of the impact of dark energy perturbations on the matter clustering can be found in @xcite .    since the perturbations of the @xmath18 field during the collapse will be neglected our results will depend only on the background expansion .",
    "any difference presented by the @xmath18cdm model when compared to the standard case is due to a non - trivial background expansion caused by the magnitude @xmath53 .    in this case",
    "the effective fluids are represented by the baryons and dark matter . since , @xmath54 ,",
    "both components obey separately an equation of the type ( [ eqdeltaorig ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath55",
    "@xmath56    adapting equation ( [ eqthetaorig ] ) to this case , the dynamics of the velocity potential is given by    @xmath57    for the background we fix @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "our final results which will focused on the value of @xmath53 are not very sensitive to the choice of these background values .    following @xcite and @xcite",
    "we solve numerically the system of equations ( [ blambda ] ) - ( [ thetalambda ] ) with initial conditions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the initial amplitudes of the dark matter and baryonic perturbations exemplify the known fact that baryonic matter tracks the `` already existing '' dark matter potential wells after the decoupling .    in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 we show the results for the dark matter and baryonic growth as well as the expansion rate of the collapsed region @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "in the top panels of figs .",
    "1,2 and 3 the @xmath1cdm result is shown with the red solid line .",
    "for the dark matter diffusion case we plot dashed lines with values @xmath65 and @xmath66 which can be identified with the captions of these figures .",
    "the bottom panels in fig . 1 and 2 are complementary to the top ones .",
    "they display the relative ( percentage ) difference in comparison to the @xmath1cdm model , i.e. , @xmath67 . from fig .",
    "3 we can infer the redshift at which the turnaround happens , i.e. , @xmath68 . for the @xmath1cdm models",
    "@xmath69 while for the diffusion model with @xmath65 we find @xmath70 . if @xmath65 the turnaround would occur only in a future time at @xmath71 .",
    "we can understand these results uniquely in terms of the background expansion .",
    "the interaction between dark matter and the field @xmath18 makes the background expansion faster than in the @xmath1cdm case and , consequently , structures form slower in the diffusion scenario .",
    "[ fig1 ]         [ fig2 ]         [ fig3 ]          let us deduce the equations for the spherical collapse when the dark energy perturbation is allowed , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "the baryonic component is an independent quantity and therefore it obeys the same equation as in the previous case @xmath73    for the dark matter component we have to derive an equivalent equation to ( [ eqdeltaorig ] ) .",
    "taking into account that the energy balance ( [ cont ] ) between the collapsed region ( superscript @xmath40 ) and the background expansion we find @xmath74    note that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the particle mass .",
    "therefore , in the same way as we have @xmath77 , the perturbed particle number can be written as @xmath78 since @xmath13 refers to number of dark matter particles . evaluating ( [ nc ] ) we find out that the new terms which are proportional to @xmath8 cancels out and therefore even in presence of dark energy fluctuations the dark matter obeys to the same equation as in the previous case @xmath79    the corresponding version of ( [ eqthetaorig ] )",
    "when @xmath80 becomes @xmath81 hence we need an equation for the evolution of @xmath82 . by deriving with respect to the time",
    "the relation @xmath83 we arrive at @xmath84    the system ( [ b3 ] ) , ( [ dm3 ] ) , ( [ theta3 ] ) and ( [ deltaphi ] ) will be solved numerically with the same initial conditions as in the previous analysis but adding @xmath85 .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 . fig .",
    "4 can be directly compared to fig .",
    "1 ( top panel ) , fig.6 corresponds to the same as fig .",
    "2 ( top panel ) and fig . 7 to the 3 , respectively .    as seen in fig .",
    "4 , allowing for the perturbation of the dark energy field the dark matter growth is clearly favoured . here , in oppostition to the case",
    "@xmath86 , the background expansion plays a secondary role .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath87 is mostly driven by the energy flux comming from the scalar field perturbation @xmath82 which , on the other hand , evolves to form underdense regions .    since perturbations of the scalar field are also able to modify the total first order dynamics of the collapsing region we define the quantity    @xmath88    and plot it in fig.5 .",
    "this quantity tries to illustrate the effective contribution of the scalar field perturbation to the dark matter one . in some sense , it can be seen as a possible representation of the total `` dark '' sector perturbation within the shell . since @xmath89 is suppressed in comparison to @xmath90 we interpret it as a @xmath82 forming an underdense region , i.e. , a void .",
    "in particular , as long the perturbation remain below the non - linear regime @xmath91 we observe a similar growth supression effect as in the case @xmath86 .",
    "however , the total dark perturbation growth represented by @xmath89 is propelled when the nonlinear regime is crossed .",
    "this new effect was not observed in the previous analysis and even in the linear theory studied in @xcite .",
    "the baryonic growth shown in fig .",
    "6 tracks the dark matter one rather than @xmath89 . also , the faster collapse of the expansion @xmath64 shown in fig .",
    "7 is consistent with the amplitude excess of @xmath87 and @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig4 ]        [ fig4a ]     as a function of the redshift.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    [ fig5 ]        [ fig6 ]",
    "we have studied the spherical top - hat collapse when dark matter particles undergo velocity diffusion . this approach is justified here since no pressure gradients are present in the model .",
    "the dark matter diffusion process is compatible with general relativity since a cosmological solvent field is added to the field equations .",
    "the resulting flrw expansion corresponds to an interacting model where energy flows from the dark energy solvent field @xmath18 to the dark matter component at a rate which is proportional to the coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath1cdm model is recovered when @xmath9 .      within the dark matter diffusion model we have studied two subcases , namely , when @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the reason for choosing the former case consists in admmiting the @xmath18 field as a geometric quantity which , of course , does not cluster and therefore is only able to modify the collapse via its effects on the background expansion . indeed ,",
    "this is a case similar to the cosmological constant . in general",
    ", it is expected that perturbations in the dark energy sector are irrelevant in comparison to the matter ones . for this case",
    "the value @xmath65 shows only a slightly growth suppression when compared to the standard cosmology .",
    "the second subcase studied ( @xmath95 ) represents a more complete description of the perturbative evolution of the model .",
    "in general , the dynamics is much more sensitive for the same values of @xmath53 .",
    "now the total perturbation within the collapsing region can be splitted into the two `` dark''components . in order to illustrate the behavior of the scalar field perturbation we have defined the quantity @xmath89 from which one can infer that @xmath82 form underdense regions .",
    "concerning the magnitude of the diffusion mechanism we conclude that the study of the dark matter top - hat collapse under diffusion provides us complementary results concerning the evolution of the matter fluctuations in an expanding universe .",
    "in some sense , our results corroborate previous findings about the magnitude of the dark matter diffusion . in general , this qualitative analysis allows us to conclude that diffusive dark matter collapses in a very similar way as the standard model for @xmath93 .",
    "we hope that in a future contribution a more detailed investigation using for example the mass functions of the model can be used to further explore the parameter space assessing the region @xmath96 .",
