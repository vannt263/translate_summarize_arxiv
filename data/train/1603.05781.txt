    "consider a network or graph @xmath0 formed by @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 undirected links between these nodes , how to delete a minimum number of nodes ( the optimal targets of attack ) to break the network down into many disconnected small components ?",
    "this optimization problem is one of the fundamental structural problems in network science @xcite , and it has very wide practical applications , especially in protection of network structure @xcite and in surveillance and control of various network dynamical processes such as the transmission of infective disease @xcite . besides their structural importance , the optimal target nodes of network attack also play significant roles in network information diffusion . many of these nodes are influential spreaders of information and are the key objects in viral marketing and network advertisement @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of a network s giant connected component is the collective effect caused by a set @xmath3 of nodes .",
    "there are extremely many candidate solutions for the network attack problem , and minimizing the size of such a set @xmath3 is an intrinsically difficult combinatorial optimization issue .",
    "this problem belongs to the np - hard ( non - deterministic polynomial hard ) class of computational complexity , no one expects it to be exactly solvable by any polynomial algorithm .",
    "so far the network optimal attack problem has mainly been approached by heuristic methods which select target nodes based on local metrics such as the node degree ( number of attached links ) @xcite and the node eigenvector centrality @xcite .    for sparse random networks",
    "it is well known that the typical length of loops diverges with the number @xmath1 of nodes in a linear way , and short loops of length @xmath4 are very rare @xcite . in such networks",
    "the small connected components are mostly trees ( no loop inside ) , while each giant component includes a finite fraction of all the nodes and an exponential number of long loops .",
    "if these long loops are all cut the giant component will again break into a set of small tree components . for random network ensembles , therefore , the optimal attack problem is essentially equivalent to another celebrated global optimization , namely the minimum feedback vertex set problem @xcite . a feedback vertex set ( fvs ) for a network @xmath0 is a set of nodes which , if deleted , would break all the loops in the network and leave behind a forest ( that is , a collection of tree components ) . in other words ,",
    "a fvs is a node set that intersects with every loop of the network , and a minimum fvs is just a node set of smallest size among all the feedback vertex sets . because small components of spare random networks are mostly trees , a minimum fvs is essentially a minimum set of target nodes for the network attack problem .",
    "although the minimum fvs problem is also np - hard , a very convenient mapping of this optimization problem to a locally constrained spin glass model was achieved in 2013 @xcite . by applying the replica - symmetric mean field theory of statistical mechanics to this spin glass model ,",
    "the minimum fvs sizes and hence also the minimum numbers of targeted attack nodes are quantitatively estimated for random erds - reny ( er ) and random regular ( rr ) network ensembles @xcite , which are in excellent agreement with rigorously derived lower bounds @xcite and simulated - annealing results @xcite . inspired by the spin glass mean field theory , an efficient minimum - fvs construction algorithm , belief propagation - guided decimation ( bpd ) , was also introduced in @xcite , which is capable of constructing close - to - minimum feedback vertex sets for single random network instances and also for correlated networks . to solve the optimal attack problem for a network containing a lot of short loops ,",
    "the bpd algorithm can be adjusted slightly by allowing the existence of loops within each small connected component .",
    "such a bpd algorithm can produce a nearly - minimum set of target nodes to break the giant components .    in 2015 ,",
    "morone and makse considered the network optimal attack problem as an optimal influence problem and introduced an interesting heuristic collective information ( ci ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "these authors called the optimal targets of network attack as the optimal influencers of the network to emphasize their importance to information spreading . in the ci algorithm ,",
    "each node @xmath5 is assigned an impact value which counts the number of out - going links at the surface of a ` ball ' of radius @xmath6 centered around @xmath5 ; and then the highest - impact nodes are sequentially deleted from the network ( and the impact values of the remaining nodes are updated ) until the largest component of the remaining network becomes sufficiently small .",
    "this ci algorithm was tested on random networks and a set of real - world networks and it was claimed that it beats existing heuristic algorithms @xcite .",
    "morone and makse also compared the results obtained by ci and bpd on a single random scale - free network and they found `` evidence of the best performance of ci '' @xcite .",
    "the ci algorithm is local in nature , it considers only the local structure within distance @xmath6 to each focal node to build the node importance metric .",
    "the claim that such a local - metric algorithm is capable of beating the bpd algorithm , a distributed message - passing algorithm taking into account the global loop structure of the network , is indeed quite surprising .",
    "given the importance of the optimal attack problem in network science , and considering that only a single network instance was checked in @xcite , we believe it will be beneficial to the research community for us to give a detailed description of the bpd algorithm for the optimal attack problem and to perform a systematic comparative study on the ci and the bpd algorithm . in the present paper , after reviewing the most essential building blocks of the ci and the bpd algorithm , we describe simulation results obtained on three random network ensembles ( random er and rr networks , whose structures are homogeneous ; and random scale - free networks , whose structures are heterogeneous ) , and a set of real - world network instances ( whose structures are heterogeneous and highly correlated , and there are an abundant number of short loops inside ) .    our extensive simulation results convincingly demonstrate that the bpd algorithm offers qualitatively superior solutions to the network optimal attack problem for random and real - world networks .",
    "our data reveal that , both for random and for real - world networks , the solutions constructed by the ci algorithm are far from being optimal . for example , to break an internet network instance ( intnet2 of table  [ tab : realnet ] , with @xmath7 nodes ) following the recipe offered by ci one would have to attack @xmath8 nodes simultaneously , but actually the job can be finished by attacking only @xmath9 nodes if instead the recommendations of the bpd algorithm are adopted . for sparse networks",
    "the running time of the bpd algorithm scales almost linearly with the number @xmath1 of nodes in the network , so it is ideally suitable for treating network instances of extreme sizes .",
    "let us close this introductory section by pointing out a potential challenge that network defense practitioners might have to consider in the near future .",
    "imagine that certain group of antisocial agents ( e.g. , terrorists ) plans to carry out an intentional distributed network attack by destroying a small set of target nodes specified by the bpd algorithm or other loop - focused global algorithms .",
    "under such a bpd - guided distributed attack , our example results of fig .",
    "[ fig : erattack ] ( solid line ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : realnet ] suggest that the network remains to be globally intact and connected before it undergoes a sudden and abrupt collapse . for the defense side , such a ` no serious warning '",
    "situation might make it very difficult to distinguish between intentional attacks and random localized failures and to carry out timely reactions .",
    "we leave this issue of theoretical and practical importance to further serious investigations .",
    "as we already introduced , the goal of the network optimal attack problem is to construct a minimum node set @xmath3 for an input network @xmath0 so that the sub - network induced by all the nodes not in @xmath3 has no connected component of relative size exceeding certain small threshold @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xmath11 or even smaller ) .",
    "the ci algorithm of @xcite and the bpd algorithm of @xcite are two heuristic solvers for this np - hard optimization problem . for pedagogical reasons we summarize in this section the main algorithmic steps of these two solvers .",
    "we do not delve into the underlying statistical physical ideas and concepts but encourage the reader to consult the original references .",
    "starting from the input network @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 links , both the ci and the bpd algorithm kick nodes out of the network in a sequential manner .",
    "let us denote by @xmath12 the remaining network at time @xmath13 of the deletion process , and denote by @xmath14 the degree ( number of neighboring nodes ) of a node @xmath5 in @xmath12 .",

    "we expect that during the bpd - guided attack process , the most significant changes in the network is that the number of loops in the giant components decreases quickly .",
    "a highly connected node that bridges two or more parts of the network will only have a low probability of being deleted if it does not contribute much to the loops of the network @xcite .",

    "[ fig : realnet ] for some examples ) .",
    "in this work we demonstrated that the network optimal attack problem , a central and difficult optimization problem in network science , can be solved very efficiently by a bpd message - passing algorithm that was originally proposed to tackle the network feedback vertex set problem @xcite . in terms of time complexity , the bpd algorithm is almost a linear algorithm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bpdtimecomp]a ) , so it is applicable even to extremely huge real - world networks .",
    "our numerical results also demonstrated that the local collective information algorithm of @xcite can not offer nearly optimal solutions to the network optimal attack problem ( which was re - named as the network optimal influence problem in @xcite ) .",
    "as an empirical algorithm designed to cut loops most efficiently , the bpd will be very useful in network resilience studies and in help identifying the most influential nodes .",
    "another major observation was that the bpd - guided attach causes an abrupt breakdown of the network .",
    "this latter dynamical property , combined with requiring only a minimum number of target nodes , may make the bpd - guided attack scheme a dangerous strategy if it is adopted for destructive purposes . the society might need to seriously evaluate such a potential threat and , if necessary , to implement suitable prevention protocols .",
    "an anoymous reviewer suggested to us that it might be sufficient to compare the largest eigenvalue of the network s non - backtracking matrix ( also called the hashimoto matrix ) @xcite to distinguish between an intentional attack and a randomized node deletion process .",
    "we hope to explore this interesting idea in a separate paper .    for simplicity we assumed in this paper that the cost @xmath111 of deleting a node @xmath5 is the same for different nodes , i.e. , @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "let us emphasize that if this cost is not uniform but is node - specific , the bpd algorithm is also appicable @xcite .",
    "the only essential modification is that the re - weighting factor @xmath114 in eqs .",

    "the paper of braunstein and co - authors @xcite considered the network optimal attack problem also as a minimum feedback vertex set problem , while the paper of clusella and co - authors @xcite applied the idea of explosive percolation to the optimal attack problem .",
    "the paper of morone and co - authors @xcite presented a new version of the ci algorithm which , at the cost of much increased computing time , may achieve better solutions than the original ci algorithm .",

    "for each leaf node ( say @xmath5 ) we know that its deletion will lead to a sub - tree of size @xmath118 , and we let this leaf node to send a message @xmath119 to its unique neighbor @xmath25 in tree @xmath116 .",

    "after all the leaves of @xmath120 have been examined , we again delete them to get a further reduced tree @xmath126 and we repeat to consider all the leaf nodes of @xmath126 in the same way .",
    "after a few iterations all the nodes in the original tree @xmath116 will be exhausted , and we will be able to identify the optimal node @xmath5 for breaking this tree @xmath116 .",
