    "cyclic voltammetry ; diffusion within a sphere ; templated porous electrodes ; potential step chronoamperometry .",
    "the use of porous electrodes for electroanalytical measurements is growing because of the scope for altered voltammetric responses which may , under favourable circumstances , offer a more sensitive response and at a lower over - potential than conventional macro - electrodes where mass transport occurs via semi - infinite diffusion .",
    "such electrodes are often made by using as a template layers of spheres , for example made of polystyrene , on the surface of a pre - existing macroelectrode .",
    "metal , very often gold , is then electroplated around the spheres before the latter are removed , for example via dissolution in a suitable solvent . the created porous structure can then , in an idealised sense , be thought of as a three dimensional network of hollow metal spherical holes interconnected via tiny ducts which allow hole to hole transport and which are likely formed at the points of contact between the original templating spheres .",
    "table [ porous uses ] shows recent examples of the use of porous electrodes fabricated in this manner in electrochemical sensing , where both improved sensitivity and limits of detection are often claimed .",
    "these include the detection of species such as nadh@xcite , glucose@xcite , nitrobenzene@xcite and hydrogen peroxide@xcite , in addition to a number of immunosensors@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop theory for porous electrodes constructed with the method described above and summarised in fig [ scheme ] .",
    "in particular we seek to identify the contributions to the voltammetric and chronoamperometric signals resulting from material diffusing to the top of the surface of the electrode from bulk solution and from material within the spherical holes of the porous structure .",
    "qualitatively we anticipate that the latter will give rise , under suitable timescales , to a `` thin layer '' type response and that this can lead to a reduced overpotential .",
    "if a mixture of analytes in solution have similar formal potentials under bulk diffusion conditions alone , the additional thin layer element may be used to discriminate between them if they enter the porous layer to differing extents.@xcite .    in the following",
    "we employ a `` decoupling '' of the two modes of transport , diffusion to the electrode surface and transport within the porous layer , which has been shown experimentally to be the case for porous electrodes fabricated using drop casting of carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "electrochemistry at a porous electrode is simulated . a simple , single electron transfer",
    "is considered : @xmath0 the transfer is assumed to take place in solution with a large amount of inert supporting electrolyte to ensure that mass transport is diffusion only .    the porous electrode is considered to be a series of interconnected spherical voids within a conductive material .",
    "these electrodes may be fabricated by supporting a series of nanosized polystyrene spheres on a macroelectrode surface , and surrounding them with a layer of , for example , electro - deposited gold .",
    "the spheres are then dissolved away , leaving behind a network of interconnected holes , through which solution containing the analyte of interest may permeate . for simplicity , and to generate an idealised structure amenable to theoretical modeling , we assume the porous layer comprises hollow spheres formed from where the polystyrene were dissolved and tiny pores of negligible size linking adjacent spheres .",
    "this allows the entire porous layer to be flooded with electrolyte when immersed in a solution .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig.[scheme ] , which shows a view of the spheres supported on an electrode ( a ) , and a zoomed in view of the porous , interconnected hollow sphere structures ( b ) . in this study ,",
    "the electrode is modeled as a series of identical , hollow , independent conductive spheres ( fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ( c ) ) . after the start of an experiment",
    ", it is assumed that negligible diffusion occurs either from sphere to sphere or between the spheres and the bulk .",
    "if the spheres are small enough relative the the radius of the disc they are supported on , then the top of the layer(s ) of spheres can be considered a disc electrode .",
    "the reasons for this latter simplification are discussed next .",
    "the electrochemical behavior of flat micro- ( and nano- ) electrode arrays can be divided into four distinct cases@xcite , as summarised in fig .",
    "[ cases ] . in case 1 ,",
    "the timescale is short enough so that the diffusion layers are independent and do not overlap .",
    "this leads to linear diffusion and a cottrellian response from the array as a whole . in case 2 ,",
    "the timescale is longer , and while the electrodes still have independent diffusion layers , these layers are now large compared to the electrodes , and convergent diffusion occurs .",
    "the response can be considered to be that of several independent micro electrodes . in case 3 ,",
    "the diffusion layers become comparable in size to the electrode separation , and begin to overlap . in case 4 ,",
    "the diffusion layers are very large compared to the electrodes and the distance between them .",
    "the diffusion layers merge into a single diffusion layer , and the array behaves as a single , much larger electrode , and cottrellian ( planar diffusion ) behavior is again observed . by considering the top layer of spheres to behave as a case 4 array",
    ", it may be modeled as a macroelectrode .",
    "this will be valid provided at least several layers of spheres are used in the electrode construction and that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the timescale of the experiment , @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient of the species interest and @xmath4 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "these conditions are thought to hold for the electrodes studied later in this paper .",
    "further to this assumption of modeling the top layer of spheres as a case 4 electrode array , we also assume that diffusion inside the hollow spheres is completely decoupled from the diffusion down to the top layer of spheres .",
    "we also assume that no diffusion occurs between individual spheres .",
    "this allows us to simulate the response inside a single sphere and and the response at a disc electrode .",
    "the single sphere result can be multiplied by the number of spheres present , and added to the disc response from the exposed top layer of spheres to give an overall response .",
    "this model is used to simulate two electrochemical experiments : potential step chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry , which are now discussed in turn .      in a potential step chronoamperometric",
    "experiment , the potential applied to the electrode is stepped from a value where no electron transfer takes place , to a value where electron transfer occurs at a rate dictated by the mass transport of the chemical species to the electrode surface .",
    "the spherically symmetric environment inside a sphere can be reduced to a one dimensional system .",
    "the dependence of concentration of any species on time is given by fick s second law in spherically symmetric space : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the concentration and @xmath7 the diffusion coefficient of species @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the radial coordinate , equal to zero at the centre of the sphere , and equal to @xmath10 at the inside edge of the sphere .",
    "symbols are defined in table [ dimensional ] .",
    "initial conditions are : @xmath11 note that for single step chronoamperometry , as considered here , species b need not be considered .    at time @xmath12 , the start of the experiment , the electrode potential is stepped , and the boundary condition at the electrode surface becomes : @xmath13    at the centre of the sphere , a zero flux boundary condition is imposed on both species as a result of symmetry : @xmath14    in order to simplify the model , dimensionless parameters are introduced .",
    "these are listed in table [ dimensionless ] . upon introduction of these parameters ,",
    "the mass transport equation becomes : @xmath15 dimensionless boundary conditions are listed in table [ sphere boundary conditions ] .",
    "to calculate the current , a dimensionless flux at the sphere surface is calculated : @xmath16 this is transformed into a real , dimensional current , @xmath17 / amps , by : @xmath18      the only change that need be made to the above model to instead simulate cyclic voltammetry inside a sphere is the electrode surface boundary condition , where butler - volmer kinetics are instead employed . using butler - volmer kinetics@xcite , which can be shown to be a limiting form of assymetric marcus - hush theory@xcite , the flux at the electrode surface is given by : @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are transfer coefficients , and it is assumed that @xmath22 .",
    "conservation of mass results in equal fluxes of species a and b : @xmath23    dimensionless boundary conditions are again summarised in table [ sphere boundary conditions ] . the dimensionless flux density and the real current are calculated the same as for chronoamperometry .",
    "chronoamperometry at a disc electrode is well characterised and may be calculated using the shoup and szabo equation @xcite . in our model of the porous electrode by hypothesis we decouple the current response from the interior of the spheres from that of the overall `` disc '' .",
    "thus there are two electrode radii ( that of a sphere and that of the disc ) , which without due care will complicate the analysis of theoretical results in terms of dimensionless parameters .",
    "we therefore use the radius of the spheres as the basis for our set of dimensionless parameters . a dimensionless disc radius , @xmath24 ,",
    "must then be defined as : @xmath25 the shoup - szabo equation can then be expressed : @xmath26\\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath27    simulation methods for cyclic voltammetry at a macrodisc electrode have been well established .",
    "the relevant mass transport equation is : @xmath28 butler - volmer kinetics are again used as the electrode surface boundary condition , now applied at @xmath29 rather than @xmath30 .",
    "the zero flux bulk solution boundary condition is applied at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the largest ( dimensionless ) diffusion coefficient in the system and @xmath33 is the total dimensionless time taken to run the experiment .",
    "this position has been shown to be well outside the diffusion layer@xcite .",
    "dimensionless boundary conditions , and the boundaries at which they apply , for a macrodisc are shown in table [ disc boundary conditions ] .    the dimensionless flux at the disc , @xmath34 , ( defined as ) : @xmath35 is given by : @xmath36      we assume the electrochemical response at a porous electrode is the sum of the responses inside the hollow spheres ( modeling the pores ) and the disc like response from diffusion to the top layer of spheres .",
    "if there is negligible diffusion between individual spheres and the bulk during electrolysis , then the overall current will be the sum of the two responses : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the currents from the spheres and the `` disc '' respectively . defining the total number of spheres as @xmath40 , then in dimensionless terms : @xmath41 and @xmath42      numerical simulation of chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry necessitates the discretisation of the mass transport equations and boundary conditions in space and time , for which the crank - nicolson method is used@xcite .",
    "the equations are then solved simultaneously and implicitly over all space using the thomas algorithm@xcite to solve the large banded matrices produced .",
    "appropriate spatial and temporal grids must be defined to discretise and solve the equations over .",
    "for chronoamperometry , the temporal grid consists of a dense , regular mesh of points from @xmath43 up to some switching value , @xmath44 . after this value , the temporal grid expands and becomes less dense .",
    "mathematically : @xmath45 for cyclic voltammetry , the temporal grid is defined in terms of the dimensionless potential .",
    "each unit of @xmath46 is divided into @xmath47 evenly spaced points .",
    "the temporal grid then defined to be : @xmath48 for the spatial grid inside a sphere ( for both chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry ) , the grid expands away from the electrode surface at @xmath30 after an initial step of @xmath49 .",
    "mathematically : @xmath50 the final @xmath51 point is defined as zero , the centre of the sphere .    for a macrodisc ,",
    "a similar grid is used , with an initial step size of @xmath52 from zero , and then expanding out to bulk solution : @xmath53    convergence studies found the following grid parameters sufficient to ensure simulated results were within 0.2% of fully converged outcomes : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "typical run times were of the order 5 to 10 seconds per simulation .",
    "the models were programmed in c++ and all simulations carried out on an intel(r ) xenon(r ) 2.26 ghz pc with 2.25 gb ram .",
    "if we consider the chronoamperometric response inside the spherical holes of a porous electrode to be completely decoupled from that outside , then the total response will be a mixture of two kinds of diffusion ; that occurring inside the spherical voids and that occurring at the `` disc like '' surface of the top layer of spheres shown schematically in fig [ scheme ] .",
    "note that the number of layers of spheres supported on the disc electrode is arbitrary , subject to fulfilling the assumption identified above .",
    "the important parameter is the number of spheres , @xmath40 .    to understand these types of diffusion ,",
    "chronoamperometric responses due to each kind are calculated and compared .",
    "chronoamperometry is simulated inside a hollow sphere using the model outlined above , giving the dimensionless result shown by the solid line in fig [ chrono cases ] ( which shows dimensionless flux against dimensionless time in a log - log plot ) .",
    "this result is compared to known analytical results for an isolated planar macrodisc electrode , given by the cottrell equation@xcite : @xmath60 which in the dimensionless form becomes : @xmath61 this is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ chrono cases ] . for comparison , the analytical equation for the chronoamperometric response _ outside _",
    "an isolated sphere is given by@xcite : @xmath62 ( where s denotes the response outside of a sphere ) , given in dimensionless parameters by : @xmath63 this is shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ chrono cases ] . at small values of @xmath64 ,",
    "all three cases show linearity in the log - log plot , corresponding to planar diffusion very close to the surface . in this limit ,",
    "the diffusion is blind to the large scale shape of the electrode .",
    "as @xmath64 increases , however , differences become apparent .",
    "the response inside the sphere starts to drop off rapidly , as all the material inside the sphere is used up .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the well known response outside a sphere , which reaches a limiting steady state current due to efficient spherical diffusion .",
    "the `` infinite '' cottrellian macrodisc response continues to be linear , and decreases steadily to zero .    by modeling a porous electrode as being the sum of a large number of hollow spheres and the overall disc , we can approximate the chronoamperometric response of the porous electrode .",
    "the contribution of the spheres is obtained _ via _ simulation .",
    "the exposed surface of the top layer of spheres can be considered as a disc in which the conductive gold deposited around the upper most layer of spheres is sufficient to generate case 4 like behavior so that the porous electrode surface behaves like macrodisc .",
    "the basis for this is provided by extensive previous simulations which show that only a tiny amount of active surface is required to achieve diffusion control to the entire geometric disc surface@xcite . since @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the separation between spheres ) the diffusion layers around each top layer pore will overlap to a large extent and",
    "form a single , large diffusion layer .",
    "the contribution of the disc can be therefore obtained _ via _ the shoup and szabo equation , as outlined in section [ disc chrono ] .",

    "the other lines , from bottom to top , have 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 @xmath72 spheres respectively .",
    "it is seen that , the more spheres there are , the greater the deviation from the shoup and szabo case at small @xmath64 values . in all cases however , by the time @xmath64 has reached 1 , the contribution from the spheres is insignificant , since all the material inside them has been used up , and only the `` disc '' response remains .",
    "the response inside the spheres can be expected to have a more significant contribution to the overall current if the experiment is carried out in an ionic liquid ( rather than in conventional solvents ) due to the drastically lowered diffusion coefficients . for a typical sphere radius of 250 nm@xcite , and diffusion coefficient in an ionic liquid of @xmath73 m@xmath74 s@xmath75 , this means the contribution from the spheres will not be seen after roughly 5 milliseconds , making it difficult to observe experimentally as it will be masked by double layer charging .",
    "conversely , for aqueous systems , a typical diffusion coefficient would be of the order @xmath76",
    "m@xmath74 s@xmath75 , meaning the signal from inside the spheres is lost after roughly 10 @xmath77s , and will certainly not be observed using conventional chronoamperometry .",

    "is initially dominated by the spheres . around @xmath84",

    ", it is seen that the log - log plot of the response is linear at all times .",
    "the current from inside the spheres is swamped by the large disc response and is not seen .",
    "the large size of the disc also means that steady state is not reached in this timescale , and a cottrellian response is all that is seen .",
    "cyclic voltammetry measured inside a sphere will vary greatly in character depending on the scan rate used . at low scan rates ( or small spheres )",
    "all of the electroactive species inside the sphere will be consumed , leading to a `` thin layer '' response . at high scan rates ( or large spheres )",
    "the depletion layer can not extend very far into the interior of the sphere , leading to a `` diffusional '' response .",
    "this is seen qualitatively in fig [ differnet sigma ] which shows simulated cyclic voltammograms with @xmath85 values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath81 ( normalised to a peak height of one ) .",
    "a clear transition is seen from a thin layer response , through an intermediate case to a diffusional response .",

    "the peak hight is proportional to the square root of the scan rate .",
    "this is seen in fig [ j vs sigma ] .",
    "part ( a ) of this figure is a log - log plot of dimensionless peak height vs @xmath85 , and shows a very clear change of gradient .",
    "part ( b ) shows the value of this gradient , which changes from one at low @xmath85 to a half at high @xmath85 .",
    "simulated cyclic voltammograms at a porous electrode are shown in fig [ voltammograms ] for dimensionless electrochemical rate constants of ( a ) : @xmath90 , ( b ) : @xmath91 , ( c ) : @xmath92 and ( d ) : @xmath93 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it is seen that for the largest electrochemical rate constant , only one peak is observed in each direction of the scan .",

    "are the relative contributions from electrolysis inside the spheres and from the overall disc ( dotted and dashed lines respectively ) .",

    "it is seen that the first wave in the forward scan changes size as the number of spheres is changed , and is absent if no hollow spheres are present .",
    "it is also seen that for small numbers of spheres ( 1.0 and to a lesser extent 2.5 @xmath100 ) then the small pre - peak is difficult to resolve and the precise position of the peak is essentially unreadable .",
    "part ( b ) of this figure is as part ( a ) , but with @xmath40 fixed at 10 @xmath101 and @xmath24 at 1000 , 2000 , 3000 and 4000 .",
    "it is seen that the response due to the overall disc increases as is expected , but for these parameters does not swamp the thin layer signal from inside the spheres .",
    "it should be noted however that if @xmath24 becomes extremely large , the thin layer signal will become unresolvable .",
    "we below consider the analytical implications of this peak splitting",
    ".      of particular interest is comparing the effect on the voltammetry of changing the heterogeneous rate constant , @xmath98 , on the response inside spheres and at a planar macrodisc electrode .",
    "henstridge _ et .",
    "_ predicted that at porous film electrodes a single electron transfer process can result in the observation of two peaks in cyclic voltammetry , one from electrolysis within the porous film and the other from semi - infinite linear diffusion at the film surface@xcite .",
    "the thin layer response from inside the spheres makes the transition from being electrochemically reversible to irreversible in character at lower heterogeneous rate constants than the diffusional disc response . the fact that this transition from fully reversible to fully irreversible takes place over a different range of heterogeneous rate constants in the two cases means that , for heterogeneous rate constants outside the fully reversible limit , two peaks are seen , one from thin layer electrolysis inside the pores , and one from linear diffusion to the exposed surface .",
    "the separation of these peaks is a function of @xmath98 , with the peaks becoming more separated at smaller @xmath98 , until a limiting separation is reached .",
    "this peak splitting may provide a means of directly extracting an _ approximate _",

    "this voltammetric splitting of one peak into two peaks as the electrochemical rate constant is lowered provides an approximate means of estimating @xmath98 , which is impossible for a fully irreversible system from a single peak unless the formal potential , @xmath103 , is known .",
    "it is therefore only possible to extract a combined parameter @xmath104 if only one irreversible peak is seen .",
    "if the forward wave contains two peaks however , as here predicted for a porous electrode , then the separation of these two peaks as a function of scan rate may be used to extract an approximate value of @xmath98 , and hence @xmath105 , if @xmath20 is known ( or measured ) .",

    "if @xmath85 is small but @xmath98 is large , then the response from inside the spheres will be thin layer in nature , and the disc response diffusional , but both responses are fully reversible .",
    "this leads to a constant , small peak separation .",
    "this corresponds to the simulated voltammograms shown in fig .",
    "[ voltammograms ] ( a ) , the peaks are not separated enough to be resolved into two separate peaks .    if @xmath98 is small , then the peak separation becomes a function of @xmath85 .",
    "as @xmath85 is lowered from very large values , the peak separation moves away from zero ( see above ) and the peaks begin to shift away from each other more and more , until the separation passes through a maximum and the peaks begin to move closer together again .",
    "the point at which this maximum is reached is a function of @xmath98 , occurring at lower values of @xmath85 as @xmath98 becomes smaller .    noting the above ,",
    "@xmath98 can in principle be extracted from experimental data obtained over a wide range of scan rates which contain the point of maximum separation described above .",

    "@xmath111 can then also be extracted from the position of the peaks .",
    "it should be noted that the data in fig .",
    "[ theta p ] is simulated using an @xmath20 value of 0.5 . for experimental data ,",

    "it should also be noted that this method assumes the ideal geometry of diffusionally independent perfectly spherical pores .",
    "this will therefore give us at least a highly approximate estimate of @xmath98 in any real system , where these assumptions are unlikely to be adhered to .",
    "in particular the idealised porous electrode structure here simulated is unlikely to be rigorously accurate .",
    "as alluded to above , it should be noted that for small separations in peak potential between the response inside spheres and the response of the disc , the overall response may still contain a single unresolved peak , as in fig [ voltammograms ] ( a ) , where the responses overlap .",
    "the number of spheres present on the surface also has an impact , too few and the thin layer signal will be swamped by the diffusional signal and not visible .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ change n ] .",
    "it is seen that for a small number of spheres ( @xmath112 and to a lesser extent @xmath113 ) then the peak position of the first , thin layer signal is not readily readable .",
    "thus for the proposed approximate method of extracting @xmath114 , it is desirable to have very clearly defined peaks to read off the peak positions , so an optimal number of spheres on the surface is desirable so two peaks are visible although not so large that the signal from inside the spheres begins to swamp the signal from the disc .",
    "we have developed a theory which allows insight into the electrochemistry of porous electrode structures formed via electroplating around spherical templates which are then removed . it is concluded that in chronoamperometry the timescale for diffusional transport within the spherical voids of the porous layer is so fast that its contribution is usually masked by double layer charging effects . in cyclic",
    "voltammetry however , significant contributions from electrolysis of material both within the voids and from semi - infinite linear diffusion to the electrode surface is predicted to be observed .",
    "this mixed contribution of thin layer and semi infinite diffusion is shown , in principle , to be useful in extracting heterogeneous rate constants for quasi reversible and irreversible electron transfer processes .",
