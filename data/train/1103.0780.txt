    "<S> the s - matrix at this parameter choice as well as all trajectories are topologically trivial . since there is no continuous way to tune scattering matrix from tt to tnt class , the s - matrix will stay trivial at any strength of magnetic field / spin - orbit interaction , even in the `` topological '' parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> this proof is in apparent contradiction with the predictions mentioned @xcite , this forming a _ paradox _ that motivated us for the present research . </S>",
    "<S> prior to presenting the solution of the paradox , let us mention that the absence of tntt resolves an annoying problem that concerns the parity of particle number of the ground state of the ss junction . </S>",

    "<S> it becomes energetically favourable to put a single polarized quasiparticle to the junction @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> odd number of crossings at a closed curve implies indefinite parity of the ground state : a situation that is annoyingly difficult to comprehend .    to see how the paradox is resolved , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider numerical results for a finite sn junction in `` topological '' parameter range.(fig . </S>",

    "<S> however , replotting the results near @xmath3 at smaller scale reveals topological triviality ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . 4a and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues move fast in the vicinity of @xmath3 reconnecting the branches visible at larger energy scale in a rather unexpected way . </S>",
    "<S> the typical energy scale of such reconnection is small depending exponentially on the contact length @xmath28 , and shrinks to zero at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this solves the paradox .    </S>",
    "<S> the adequate description of the situation combines a smooth energy dependence of s - matrix at @xmath30 with a pole or poles that are anomalously close to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a single pole . </S>",
    "<S> the bdg constraints restrict it to purely imaginary energy , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the s - matrix reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the eigenvector associated with the resonant level and @xmath34 is the matrix , with smooth energy dependence to disregard at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues in this energy range are determined from equation @xmath36 @xmath37 being `` high - energy '' ( @xmath38 ) eigenvalues of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> they follow the pattern in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] connecting neighboring `` high - energy '' eigenvalues , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees that the total shift of phases of all eigenvalues upon crossing a single pole equals @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the pole is associated with a quasi - localized zero - energy state being formed at the far end of the wire . if the contact length exceeds the localization length , this state is efficiently `` buried '' ( @xmath42 ) in the superconductor and hardly accessible for incoming electron or hole waves except @xmath3 when the scattering of the waves become resonant . </S>",
    "<S> andreev conductance of the junction is expressed as @xmath43 . in the resonant energy interval </S>",
    "<S> , the energy dependence of the conductance assumes a universal form @xmath44 @xmath45 being its values at @xmath46 that depend on details of the junction .        </S>",
    "<S> let us turn to the ss junction in the `` topological '' parameter range . solving eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : spectrum ] gives the spectrum of andreev states ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the level crossing at @xmath47 being lifted in a narrow energy interval . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , we observe another pair of levels with energies remaining small in the whole range of phase . </S>",
    "<S> these levels are absent in tntt picture and emerge as a consequence of topological triviality of the s - matrix . since there is no level crossing at @xmath3 , the parity of the ground state is always even .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation can be comprehended if we notice that each matrix @xmath48 forming the resulting @xmath49 brings a resonant pole corresponding to a `` buried '' zero - energy state at far end of each wire . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath49 thus has two resonant poles . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing of the two `` buried '' states results in their ( phase - dependent ) energy splitting and formation of the pair of low - energy andreev levels . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of s - matrix move in the narrow energy interval reconnecting next - to - nearest ( two poles ) neighbour `` high - energy '' eigenvalues ( fig.[fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this brings four rather than two states in the vicinity of the crossing point @xmath50 , all being involved in the lifting of the degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed theory of the crossing point will be presented elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> since the s - matrix remains topologically trivial , there can be no sharp transition in its characteristics that would correspond to the `` topological '' transition in the ( rather unphysical ) limit of infinite wire . </S>",
    "<S> however , a bdg s - matrix with resonant poles is characterized by a topological number that can change sharply upon changing the parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> let us illustrate this with a two - pole scattering matrix correspond to the fork setup in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 a. here the scattering matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 of fork tines bring a resonant pole each . </S>",
    "<S> the bdg symmetry leaves two distinct possibilities for the poles of the total scattering matrix : @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> both poles lie on the imaginary energy axis ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> they form a pair symmetric with respect to reflection @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can now change the s - matrix @xmath56 describing the normal scattering in the fork . </S>",
    "<S> if the tines are open to the lead states , the pole configuration should be like one for two parallel sn junctions : the possibility @xmath2 is realized . if the tines are isolated , the `` buried '' states mix resulting in an energy spitting : the possibility @xmath1 is realized . </S>",
    "<S> we thus expect and @xcite prove the transition at intermediate coupling </S>",
    "<S> .    generally , one can characterize a bdg s - matrix of arbitrary dimension with a topological number that is just the number of poles lying precisely on the imaginary axis . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this number to change by @xmath57 upon changing the parameters , this gives a series of `` topological '' transitions . </S>",
    "<S> ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 b , c ) two poles are degenerate at the transition point . however , since in general the degenerate poles are at finite imaginary energy @xmath58 , the manifestations of the transitions in transport properties are limited . the energy - dependent andreev conductance does not seem to have a singularity at the transition point .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed the topological analysis of the properties of sn and ss junctions characterized by bdg s - matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we have proven topological triviality of physical matrices that describe finite - size junctions : there is neither tnt , nor tntt . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the absence of a sharp `` topological '' transition upon crossing to `` topological '' parameter range as well as the absence of @xmath0-periodic josephson effect . </S>",
    "<S> we have resolved the apparent contradiction with results of @xcite by considering the low - energy poles of s - matrices . the resulting sharp energy dependence at @xmath59leads to lorentian energy dependence of andreev conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a topological transition ( or a series of transitions ) of a different kind associated with a change of the configuration of the resonant poles in complex energy plane .    </S>",
