    "the motivation for this paper stems from an important , but seemingly forgotten 1982 report by prof .",
    "marshall p. tulin presented during the @xmath0 symposium on naval hydrodynamics , titled  _ an exact theory of gravity wave generation by moving bodies , its approximation and its implications _",
    "some thirty years after its publication , tulin wrote of his original motivation for pursuing the former study :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what were the relations and connections among these various nonlinear approximations ",

    "the resultant model was analytically simple , and took the form of a single complex - valued linear differential equation .",
    "the theory was also powerful , and provided a formulation that could relate the geometry of a moving body directly with the resultant free - surface waves .",
    "however , several important and surprising issues were raised by tulin regarding the model and its interpretation , and in particular , he had noted a paradoxical behaviour of the model at low speeds . in the years that followed , perhaps owing to the difficulty of the model s derivation , tulin s fundamental questions were never re - addressed . in this paper , we shall present an asymptotically consistent derivation that corrects tulin s model , and puts to rest many of the issues previously highlighted .    more specifically",
    ", we shall present an explicit solution written in terms of a single integral that properly describes the form of water waves produced by two - dimensional moving bodies at low speeds .",
    "then , by applying the asymptotic method of steepest descents , we are able to observe how the production of free - surface waves will change depending on the deformation of integration contours connected to the geometry of the moving body .",
    "this approach provides an intuitive and visual procedure for studying wave - body interactions .",
    "the essential derivation behind tulin s model begins from bernoulli s equation applied to a free surface with streamline , @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fluid speed , @xmath4 the streamline angle , @xmath5 the potential , and the non - dimensional parameter @xmath6 is the square of the froude number for upstream speed @xmath7 , gravity @xmath8 , and length scale @xmath9 .",
    "if the sinusoidal term is split according to the identity @xmath10 then can be written in complex - valued form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an analytic function of the complex potential , @xmath13 , and the above is evaluated on @xmath1 where @xmath14 .",
    "the rather curious substitution of is attributed to @xcite , who had argued that if @xmath15 is considered to be small , then yields a linearized version of bernoulli s equation ( in @xmath16 ) that preserves the essential nonlinearity ( in @xmath17 ) describing the structure of steep gravity waves .",
    "inspired by this idea , tulin considered the extension to general free surface flows over a moving body . since the function in the curly braces of is an analytic function in @xmath18 , except at isolated points in the complex plane , then analytic continuation implies @xmath19 where by matching to uniform flow , @xmath20 and thus @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the function @xmath23 is purely imaginary on @xmath1 . in the case of flow without a body or bottom boundary , @xmath24 , but otherwise , @xmath25 will encode the effect of the obstructions through its singular behaviour in the complex plane .",
    "if the nonlinear contribution , @xmath15 , is neglected in , then the exact solution can be written as @xmath26{\\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{1}{{\\epsilon } } \\int^w { \\mathcal{q}}(s ) \\ , { \\operatorname{d\\!}{}}{s}}.\\ ] ]    this process seems to yield the exponentially small surface waves at low speeds .",
    "however , tulin noted that as @xmath27 , there would be locations on the free surface where @xmath28 , and this would lead to unbounded steepness .",

    "is that for given @xmath30 , no matter how small , this so - called low speed theory is not valid for sufficiently low speeds .",
    "it is a theory valid for low , but not too low speeds ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the matter was left at that , and in the three decades following tulin s ingenious paper , the peculiarities surrounding the asymptotic breakdown of were never directly re - addressed ( though we mention the paper by @xcite which develops numerical solutions for the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "note that in addition to the investigation in the limit @xmath27 , tulin had also intended to produce an _ exact _ reduction , where the @xmath15 term in was handled through a theoretically posited nonlinear coordinate transformation .",
    "however , it is never clear how this transformation is used or derived in practice , except through nonlinear computation of the full solutions .      independently from tulin , e.o .",
    "tuck later presented a series of papers @xcite where he attempted to distill the wave - making properties of wave - body problems into a linear singular equation .",
    "the equation presented [ eqn ( 22 ) of @xcite ] was @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the height of the free surface , @xmath35 is a function related to the moving body , and @xmath36 is a integral operator known as the hilbert transform ( to be introduced in  [ sec : form ] ) .",
    "the difficulty in solving is that the hilbert transform is a _",
    "global _ operator , requiring values of @xmath37 over the entire domain .",
    "in the @xcite work , tuck explained how the action of @xmath36 could be viewed as similar to that of the differential operator @xmath38 .",
    "this reduction was mostly pedagogic in nature , but tuck was motivated by the fact that @xmath36 and the differential operator will act similarly in the case of sinusoidal functions .",
    "he went on to study the various properties of the singular differential equation @xmath39 that depend on the specification of the ` body ' given by @xmath35 .",
    "apparently , tuck had been unaware of tulin s ( @xcite ) work , but a chance meeting of the two occured during a conference leading to the publication of @xcite .",

    "a few years ago i in fact used the method that you describe , and it is associated with the approximation @xmath40 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    although tuck s toy reduction should only be regarded as illustrative ( the governing differential equation should rather be first order ) , what is apparent in his work is the desire to systematically reduce both the nonlinearity of bernoulli s equation , and the global effect of @xmath36 into a single ordinary differential equation . in particular , it is tuck s search for a reduction of the operator , @xmath36 , that was missing from earlier works on this topic ( including @xcite ) .",
    "certainly , tulin and tuck were not the only ones to seek simpler reductions or formulations of the nonlinear equations for wave - body interactions , and indeed , tulin relates his work to the integral models proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "reviews of these and other models were presented by @xcite and @xcite , and many others .",
    "however , what distinguishes tulin and tuck s work is the shifted focus towards the analytic continuation of the flow problem into the complex domain ; indeed , tulin notes his strong motivation by the work of @xcite in his @xcite review .    as we have noted in  [ sec : subtulin ] , the low - froude or low speed limit of @xmath27 is the essential approximation in which analytical results can be derived .",
    "the subtleties of studying this singular limit can be traced back to a seminal report by @xcite , who detailed certain oddities with the previously developed analytical approximations of free surface flow past a submerged body .",
    "chief amongst such oddities was the fact that the individual terms of a series approximation in powers of @xmath30 would fail to predict surface waves .",
    "thus , one might decompose the surface speed into a regular series expansion and an error term , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 + { \\bar{q}}.\\ ] ] the challenge , ogilvie realized , was that water waves were exponentially small in @xmath30 , with @xmath43 , and thus _ beyond - all - orders _ of any individual term of the regular series .",
    "by linearizing about the zeroth order solution , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and strategically perserving certain terms in bernoulli s equation , ogilvie developed a general analytical approximation for the exponentially small surface waves .",
    "the approximation , however , was not asymptotically consistent , and the search for a complete numerical and analytical treatment of the low froude limit would inspire many papers in the subsequent years .",
    "one of the key issues we will explore in this paper addresses the question of how many terms must be included in the linearization of in order to obtain the exponential .",
    "originally @xcite had chosen @xmath46 , but later revised to @xmath47 in @xcite ( who quoted the work of @xcite and in particular , the study by @xcite in applying the wkb method to streamline ship waves ) .",

    "additional historical details are presented in  1 of @xcite , and a selection of papers on the problem is presented in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "the method we apply in this paper , which combines an approach of series truncation with the method of steepest descents , is unique from the previously listed works .",
    "we have three principal goals in this work .    _",
    "( i ) we wish to demonstrate how tulin s formulation can be systematically derived and studied in the low speed limit . _ the source of tulin s puzzling results can be resolved through better understanding of two effects : first , the _ ad - hoc _ linearization of the nonlinear @xmath15 function ; and second , the role of the forcing function , @xmath23 .",
    "we clarify these details and demonstrate , through numerical solutions of the full nonlinear water wave equations , the convergence of different proposed models in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the fluid speed corresponding to the water waves , as in .",
    "one of our principal results ( presented on p.  ) is to demonstrate that the exponentially small waves , @xmath48 , are described to leading order by the first - order equation , @xmath49{\\bar{q}}= r(w ; { \\hat{{\\mathscr{h}}}}[{\\bar{\\theta}}]),\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath48 is then given by the sum of @xmath41 and its complex conjugate .",
    "different choices of the series truncation @xmath51 yield different versions of the right - hand side of , but only change the predicted wave amplitudes by a numerical factor .",
    "the leading order @xmath52 contains the prescription of the moving body , and can thus be related to tuck s @xmath53 function in . the formulation in terms of the speed , @xmath3 , rather than tulin s combined function @xmath54 in is more natural , but we will relate tulin s equation to our own in  [ sec : tulinconnect ] and appendix  [ sec : tulinconnect2 ] .    _ ( ii ) we also study the associated integral form of the solution using the method of steepest descents .",
    "_ we shall demonstrate how the appearance of surface waves can be associated with sudden deformations of the integration contours if the solution to is analytically continued across critical curves ( stokes lines ) in the complex plane .",
    "this process is known as the stokes phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the novelty of this steepest descents methodology is that it will allow us to not only relate the surface waves directly to the geometry of the moving body , but it will also allow us to observe how integration contours change depending on the geometry of the obstruction .",
    "in particular , we conclude that provided there exists a solution of the full potential flow problem , there are no issues with the approximations as @xmath27 limit .    _",
    "( iii ) our last goal is to provide a link between the tulin approximation , our corrected model , and also the current research on low - froude approximations . _",
    "let us now turn to a brief summary of the history of the low froude problem .",
    "let us consider steady irrotational two - dimensional flow past a moving body in the presence of gravity , @xmath8 .",
    "the body is associated with a length scale @xmath9 , and moves at constant velocity @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , this body may correspond to an obstacle at the bottom of the channel ( fig .",
    "[ formstepcyl ] , left ) , a submerged object ( fig .",
    "[ formstepcyl ] , right ) , or a surface - piercing ship ( fig .",
    "[ formship ] , left ) .",
    "we shall state more precise geometrical restrictions in  [ sec : bdint ] .    .",
    "flows past closed bluff objects can be complicated through wake separation ( seen right ) , for which the nature of the separation points is unclear .",
    "[ formstepcyl],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the velocity potential , @xmath5 , satisfies laplace s equation in the fluid region , @xmath55 . on all boundaries",
    ", the kinematic condition implies the normal derivative is zero , @xmath56 , while on the free surface , bernoulli s equation requires that @xmath57 subsequently , all quantities are non - dimensionalized using the velocity and lengths scales , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , and we introduce a cartesian coordinate system @xmath58 such that the body is fixed in the moving frame of reference .    with @xmath59 , we define the complex potential , @xmath13 , and the complex velocity is given by , @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the stream function , @xmath3 is the fluid speed , and @xmath4 is the streamline angle , measured from the positive @xmath62-axis . without loss of generality , we choose @xmath1 on the free surface and @xmath63 within the fluid .",
    "we define the logarithmic hodograph variable , @xmath64 and seek to solve the flow problem inversely , that is , use @xmath18 as an independent variable and seek @xmath65 in the lower - half @xmath18-plane .",
    "the advantage of this hodograph formulation is that with the free surface at @xmath1 , its position is known in the @xmath66-plane , even though its shape in the physical @xmath58-plane is unknown .",
    "differentiating bernoulli s equation with respect to @xmath5 and using then yields the non - dimensionalized form .      in theory , the methods we present in this paper will apply to most general two - dimensional free - surface flows . in practice , however , in order to make analytical progress , we will be constrained by problems in which the geometry of the body is known through the specification of the angle , @xmath4 , in terms of the complex potential , @xmath13 .",
    "as specific examples , let us focus on two representative geometries : ( a ) flow past a localized obstruction on a channel bottom ( fig .  [ formstepcyl ] , left ) , and ( b ) flow past a semi - infinite surface piercing ship ( fig .",
    "[ formship ] , left ) .",

    "while the generated waves are unbounded near these critical points , they remain exponentially small order everywhere along the free surface .",
