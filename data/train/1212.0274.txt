    "over the past 100 years , physicists have followed the cosmic - ray energy spectrum upward in energy .",
    "modern large - acceptance detectors like the flys eye and auger detector have observed cosmic - rays with energies up to @xmath0 ev .",
    "these cosmic - rays manifest themselves as particle showers , containing trillions of lower - energy particles , which cascade downward through the atmosphere .",
    "these cascades develop through hadronic and electromagnetic interactions which convert particle energy into additional particles .    despite much effort ,",
    "cosmic - rays are not yet well understood .",
    "we do not yet know their source(s ) or their composition .",
    "are they protons or heavier nuclei ?",
    "the answer to this question requires a detailed understanding of the reactions that shape shower development .",
    "several experiments are trying to determine their origin , by searching for cosmic neutrinos produced in these accelerators @xcite .",
    "this requires an accurate understanding of how leptons interact with matter .",
    "these neutrinos may be produced in astrophysical sources sources .",
    "many possible sources have been proposed , ranging from active galactic nuclei ( galaxies with supermassive black holes at the center ) to gamma - ray bursts ( the collapse of supermassive stars , and/or collisions involving blacks holes and neutron stars ) .",
    "one common , although not universal , feature of these models is that the neutrino spectrum is fairly hard , with the flux usually scaling as @xmath2 ; this @xmath2 is assumed in most experimental studies .",
    "for an @xmath2 spectrum , astrophysical neutrino detectors like icecube and antares are most sensitive to tev and pev neutrinos . as will be discussed below ,",
    "icecube has observed two neutrino events with energies slightly above 1 pev ( @xmath3 ev ) , ushering in the era of terascale neutrino astrophysics .",
    "neutrinos are also produced when cosmic - ray protons with energies above @xmath4 ev interact with the @xmath5 k microwave blackbody radiation and are photo - excited to the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "the @xmath6 decays , eventually producing neutrinos , mostly with energies in the @xmath7 - @xmath1  ev range .",
    "other experiments have searched for these greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin ( gzk ) neutrinos , but are not yet sensitive enough to make definitive statements .",
    "they have , however , set flux limits for neutrinos with energies up to @xmath8 ev .",
    "this writeup will review some of the unique physics that appears in particle interactions at the terascale , and thus relevant to cosmic - ray and astrophysical neutrino studies .",
    "i will emphasize phenomena that are unique to particle interactions in bulk matter , and are absent with individual atomic targets .",
    "these phenomena are most prominent in reactions involving leptons , particularly electrons and photons .",
    "at energies above @xmath9 mev , electrons and photons interact predominantly through bremsstrahlung ( ` braking radiation ' ) and pair production respectively . in bremsstrahlung",
    ", an electron or positron interacts with a target nucleus and emits a photon , while in pair production , a photon interacts with a target and converts into an @xmath10 pair .",
    "these reactions share one key kinematic feature : as the incident particle energy increases , the longitudinal momentum transfer ( @xmath11 ) from the target nucleus decreases .",
    "for bremsstrahlung of a photon with energy @xmath12 from an electron with energy @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electron mass . per the uncertainty principle",
    ", the reaction is delocalized over a distance known as the formation length , @xmath16 for pair production , the situation is similar .",
    "for a pair with an invariant mass @xmath17 , @xmath18 with the formation length calculated the same way .",
    "most pair are produced with masses just above threshold , @xmath19 @xcite . throughout this review",
    ", @xmath13 refers to electron energy , and @xmath12 refers to photon energy , for both bremsstrahlung and pair production .    for very high energy particles , the formation length can reach macroscopic distances .",
    "for example , for a @xmath20  ev photon producing a 1 mev ( i.e. at threshold ) pair , @xmath21 cm .",
    "for bremsstrahlung , even longer formation lengths are possible . for a @xmath3",
    "ev electron emitting a 1 gev photon , the formation length is over a kilometer .",
    "when the formation length is longer than the inter - atomic distance a single electron or photon may interact simultaneously with multiple atomic targets , with the amplitudes adding , rather than the cross - sections .",
    "these delocalized interactions can lead to rather non - intuitive behavior .    for bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the photon radiation depends only on the total electron multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) in the formation length .",
    "this mean scattering angle accumulates as the square root of the number of scatterers , so scales as @xmath22 . per standard electrodynamics @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of photons emitted",
    ", @xmath25 is the atomic number of the target atoms , @xmath26 the electrical charge , @xmath27 the projectile lorentz boost , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 the change in velocity and direction as the particle travels through the formation zone .",
    "when @xmath30 , the @xmath22 dependence leads to the same radiation as for independent scattering .",
    "however , when @xmath31 , the denominator in eq .",
    "[ eq : radiation ] rises rapidly , and the radiation is less than it would be if the electron interacted independently with each target atom @xcite .    one can calculate the suppression fairly simply using an expanded version of eq .",

    "also partly determines it ( by reducing the longitudinal momentum ) , some algebra leads to a quadratic equation for @xmath33 .",
    "radiation is suppressed by the ratio of the formation length with multiple scattering to that without it . when @xmath34 bremsstrahlung is suppressed . here",
    ", @xmath35 is a material dependent constant ; @xmath36 is the radiation length .",
    "@xmath37 decreases rapidly with increasing density and atomic number , so lpm suppression is most important in dense media .",

    "creating a massive photon requires additional momentum transfer from the medium , reducing the formation length and suppressing the emission .",

    "of course , if the photon interacts in other ways , then these interactions can also suppress bremsstrahlung . for optical or x - ray photons ,",
    "atomic physics plays a big role in regulating bremsstrahlung @xcite . at very high energies ,",

    "figure [ fig : cern ] shows their their data , from 287 , 207 and 149 gev electrons traversing an iridium target .",
    "this group has also made some very interesting measurements of bremsstrahlung in crystalline targets , and also with thin targets @xcite . when the target was thinner than the formation length , they observed the expected reduction in lpm suppression .    it should be mentioned that magnetic fields can also suppress bremsstrahlung",
    "of course , the same fields will also induce synchrotron radiation , and a unified treatment is required .",
    "at still higher energies photonuclear and electronuclear interactions become important . in these reactions , photons ( either real photons or virtual photons emitted by electrons ) interact hadronically with target nuclei . in the vector meson dominance picture",
    ", these photons fluctuate to quark - antiquark ( @xmath55 ) pairs which then interact with the target . at very high energies ,",

    "different models predict photonuclear cross - sections that differ by roughly a factor of 4 @xcite , so the position of the cross - over is not well known . also , when lpm suppression reduces the cross - section by more than the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath56 , higher order processes , such as direct pair production , may become important ; these require larger @xmath11 , so are less subject to lpm suppression .",

    "the shower length increases slowly , increasing roughly 1 @xmath36 for each doubling in shower energy .",
    "however , when the lpm effect appears , the shower length increases more rapidly , as individual generations develop more slowly . at energies around @xmath61 ev",
    ", hadronic interactions play a dominant role and the length increase moderates , around a value of 1 km , about 100 times larger than the length for a bethe - heitler shower . in these regimes ,",
    "the shower - to - shower variation in development is large , and one must account for these fluctuations in any study of energy spectra .    at still higher energies ,",
    "photonuclear interactions change character .",
    "photons which fluctuate to a @xmath55 pair can elastically scatter from the target , emerging as a real vector meson , usually a @xmath62 , with the same quantum numbers as the photon .",
    "when the formation length for a @xmath55 pair is larger than the typical internuclear separation , multiple nuclei can participate in the interaction .",
    "then , the @xmath55 scattering amplitudes add in - phase , and the cross - section rises . because @xmath55 pairs are much heavier than @xmath10 pairs very high energies at required .",
    "still , above @xmath63 ev , coherent conversion to @xmath62 mesons is predicted to be the dominant photonuclear interaction in solids @xcite . at still higher energies ,",
    "coherent converson continues , but heavier quarks play a significant role , leading to significant charm production @xcite .",
    "this coherent conversion has many similarities with kaon regeneration .",
    "heavier leptons are also of interest to cosmic - ray physicists .",
    "except for being heavier , and therefore unstable , muon and tau leptons behave similarly to the electron .",
    "however , the mass does affect their interactions ; for a given energy , they have a much smaller lorentz boost than electrons .",
    "they lose energy through the same processes as electrons - bremsstrahlung , direct pair production and electronuclear interactions - but the kinematics changes the relative importance of these processes . because of the reduced lorentz boost ,",
    "their energy loss is much smaller than for electrons , and they can travel long distances through solids .",
    "for example , a 100 tev muon has an average range of about 10 km in ice .",
    "taus interact even less strongly , but their short livetime ( 0.29 ps ) limits how far they can travel . because of the lorentz boost , the lpm effect comes into play at much higher energies than for electrons .",
    "muon energy loss is of great interest to large neutrino detectors .",
    "it is usually parameterized as @xmath64 where @xmath65 mev / mwe accounts for the energy loss due to ionization , and @xmath66/mwe is the energy loss due to stochastic interactions : bremsstrahlung , direct pair production , and electronuclear interactions @xcite . here",
    ", mwe is the target thickness in equivalent meters of water ; 1 meter of water corresponds to a column density of 100 g/@xmath67 .",
    "this stochastic energy loss is proportional to the muon energy .",
    "it dominates for muon energies above about 1 tev , and the measured @xmath68 is often used to estimate the muon energy . because muons can lose significant energy in a single interaction , @xmath68 varies a lot , and a better estimate of the muon energy is achieved by dividing the muon path into independent segments , and only using the @xmath69 of the segments with the lowest @xmath68 in determining the energy @xcite . the mathematical picture is similar to particle energy loss in wire chambers .",
    "high - energy neutrino interactions are studied by a number of detectors .",
    "the largest is the 1 km@xmath70 icecube neutrino observatory , located in the south pole icecap @xcite .",
    "its 5,160 buried optical sensors observe cherenkov radiation from the charged particles produced when high - energy ( above 10 - 100 gev ) neutrinos interact in the antarctic ice .",
    "the different lepton interactions and limited tau lifetime lead to very different topologies for electron , muon and tau neutrinos .    figure [ fig : icecube ] shows the three different topologies .",
    "the top panel shows a muon ( or multiple muon bundle ) .",
    "it is observed for more than 1 km , allowing for a good @xmath68 measurement . over 1 km",
    ", a 10 tev muon loses an average of 38% of its energy traversing the 1 km of ice ( the density of ice is 92% of that of water ) .",
    "the middle panel shows a shower from a neutrino interaction ; this could either be an electromagnetic shower from a @xmath60 charged current interaction , or a neutral current interaction of any neutrino flavor .",
    "since the electromagnetic and hadronic shower lengths are short ( 39 cm and 92 cm respectively ) , and the energy is low enough that the lpm effect does not significantly affect shower development .",
    "the shower deposits most of its energy in a small volume , per fig .",
    "[ fig : shower ] , but the cherenkov light is visible from several hundred meters away . the estimated @xmath71 energy is over 1 pev @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows a simulated @xmath72 double bang event @xcite , with a hadronic shower produced when the @xmath72 interacts with the ice , transferring energy to the struck nucleon , a largely invisible @xmath73 track , and a second cascade where the tau decays .",
    "high - energy hadronic interactions are much less well understood than electromagnetic reactions .",
    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) predicts the behavior of hard interactions ( those involving a large momentum transfer ) , but the coupling constant is large at low momentum transfers , so perturbative calculations do not give reliable predictions . unfortunately , most interactions are at low momentum transfers . in this region ,",
    "different calculations ( and the resulting monte carlo simulation codes ) rely on phenomenological models involving pomeron exchange .",
    "these simulations are tuned to generally agree with the available accelerator data , but diverge significantly at higher energies .",
    "the one generally reliable prediction is that cross - sections should rise relatively slowly with increasing energy @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the auger collaboration has used cosmic - ray air showers to measure the proton - air cross - section at an average energy of @xmath74 ev , corresponding to a proton - proton center of mass energy of 57 tev , far above the energy of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "they did this using a wide - field optical detector which imaged the fluorescence of atmospheric nitrogen induced as the shower propagated downward , measuring the altitude @xmath75 at which the shower had the highest particle density .",
    "iron and other heavy ( compared to protons ) nuclei are larger , and tend to interact higher in the atmosphere . since their energy is split among many nucleons , the showers develop faster .",
    "so , the collaboration selected a sample of showers that developed deep in the atmosphere , and used that to measure @xmath76 mb @xcite .",
    "this is about twice the cross - section measured at lower energies .",
    "the collaboration also used a glauber model to infer the proton - proton cross - section , and measured a value about 30% higher than was seen at the lhc , in agreement with the scaling predicted by models where the cross - section grows relatively slowly with energy .    in a related analysis ,",
    "the auger collaboration studied the distribution of @xmath75 as a function of shower energy .",
    "they observed a change in slope in the elongation rate , @xmath77 at an energy of @xmath78 ev @xcite . when compared with air shower simulations using two different hadronic interaction models , the kink is compatible with a change in cosmic - ray composition from mostly protons to mostly iron , over the energy range from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ev . in the same energy range ,",
    "the width of the @xmath75 distribution narrows dramatically , with the root - mean - square of the distribution narrowing by about a factor of two ; this is again compatible with a dramatic change in composition .",
    "although these changes are not observed by the hires flys eye experiment @xcite , that experiment has somewhat lower statistics .",
    "if the changes in elongation rate and rms variation in @xmath75 are real , one can not exclude the possibility of new hadronic physics , such as gluon recombination involving gluons at low bjorken@xmath80 values , or ( in other words ) , parton saturation @xcite .",
    "although it is not a significant contributor to particle energy loss , coherent cherenkov radiation has become an important tool for detecting ultra - high energy neutrinos .",
    "it occurs because electromagnetic and hadronic showers include more electrons than positrons .",
    "the electron excess is due to two processes : a positron in the shower can annihilate on an electron in the target , removing its charge , or a photon in the shower can compton scatter a target electron into the shower .",
    "both of these processes primarily affect low - energy particles , which are the majority of the particles in the shower ; the net effect is about a 20% excess of electrons over positrons @xcite .",
    "when viewed at a wavelength that is larger than the transverse size of the shower ( more precisely , at the cherenkov angle ) , individual shower particles can not be observed ; instead the fields depend only on the net charge in the shower and the emission is coherent .",
    "this condition is satisifed for radio waves , with frequencies up to about 1 ghz in ice , and several ghz in rock . below these frequencies ,",
    "the electric field amplitude scales as the square of the neutrino energy . at neutrino energies above about @xmath7 ev",
    ", this leads to a large signal . near the maximum frequency ,",
    "most of the radio waves are emitted near the cherenkov angle ( forming a cone ) , but , at lower frequencies , the emission becomes more isotropic .    radio emission has also been observed from cosmic - ray air showers .",
    "these showers have a much larger lateral extent , so the useful frequencies are much lower @xcite .",
    "in addition to coherent cherenkov radiation , there is also synchrotron radiation from low - energy electrons spiraling in the earth s magnetic field , plus a dipole field as positively and negatively charged particles separate in the earth s magnetic field ; these latter two components are larger than the coherent cherenkov radiation and vary , depending on the angle between the shower direction and the earth s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "radio cherenkov is the only technique that has been demonstrated to scale to the very large detector volume required for a next - generation neutrino detector .",
    "many existing experiments have already searched for radio emission from neutrino induced showers @xcite .",
    "antarctic ice and the lunar regolith are common choices .",
    "the anita balloon - borne detector has twice circled antarctica at an altitude of around 35,000 m , with 32 ( or 40 ) horn antennas searching for radio emission out to the horizon , up to 650 km away .",
    "anita has not yet seen a signal , but it has set significant limits on the possible flux of neutrinos with energies above about @xmath81 ev @xcite .    looking ahead , two groups are prototyping arrays of antennas which will be co - located in the active volume , giving them much lower neutrino energy thresholds , of order @xmath7 ev . the ara collaboration proposes to deploy an array of antennas in shallow holes at the south pole @xcite .",
    "the arianna collaboration plans to deploy an array of antennas just below the surface , on the ross ice shelf @xcite .",
    "although the ice there is warmer , and so more absorptive , the interface between the ice shelf and the ross sea below it acts as a mirror for radio waves , reflecting cherenkov radiation from downward - going neutrinos to the surface . both experiments are easily scalable , and both groups plan to instrument a volume larger than 100 km@xmath70 , enough to test models of cosmic neutrino production .",
    "cosmic - ray physics tests our understanding of particle interactions at energies up to @xmath1 ev . a these very high energies , new electromagnetic phenomena appear ,",
    "in which leptons and photon interactions with bulk matter can be very different from their interactions with isolated atoms .",
    "the lpm effect and other phenomena suppress bremsstrahlung and pair production , and , at high enough energies , electron and photon interactions become predominantly hadronic .",
    "the character of leptonic interactions depends heavily on the lepton mass and lifetime , and we use these differing characters to determine the flavor of neutrinos that interact in large neutrino observatories .",
    "hadronic interactions are not well understood , but we have used cosmic - rays to measure interaction cross - sections at energies above those accessible at the large hadron collider . fortunately , some of the new interactions that come into play at very high energies create useful signatures for observing the particles that produce them ; coherent radio cherenkov emisison is the technology of choice for the next generation of neutrino detectors that will use instrumented volumes above 100 km@xmath70 to search for neutrinos with energies above @xmath7 ev .",

    "<S> cosmic - rays with energies up to @xmath0 ev have been observed , as have as have astrophysical neutrinos with energies above 1 pev . in this talk , i will discuss some of the unique phenomena that occur when particles with tev energies and above interact with matter </S>",
    "<S> . the emphasis will be on lepton interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sections for electron bremsstrahlung and photon pair conversion are suppressed at high energies , by the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , lengthening electromagnetic showers . at still higher energies ( above @xmath1 ev ) , photonuclear and electronuclear interactions dominate , and showers become predominantly hadronic . </S>",
    "<S> muons interact much less strongly , so can travel long distances through solids before losing energy . </S>",
    "<S> tau leptons behave similarly , although their short livetime limits how far they can travel . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic interaction cross - section is believed to continue to increase slowly with rising energy ; measurements of cosmic - ray air showers support this prediction . </S>"
