    "recently the besiii collaboration has published @xcite new results on the proton electromagnetic ( em ) form factors ( ffs ) in the time - like region by measuring the process @xmath6 with very high precision at 12 different center - of - mass energies from @xmath7 gev@xmath8 to @xmath9 gev@xmath8 . in such way the obtained results enriched a set of already existing number of experimental points on proton em ffs in the space - like and time - like regions substantially . moreover , the besiii collab . and before also the babar collab .",
    "@xcite , measuring the polar angular distribution @xmath10 of created protons at few different energies , have been able to determine a separate information on the proton electric and on the proton magnetic ffs in time - like region for the first time .    on the other hand a very successful microscopic model for the proton",
    "em ffs in the near - threshold time - like region has been elaborated @xcite to be based on the assumption that the behavior of the em ffs as a function of the energy is given by the initial or final state interaction between proton and antiproton in the processes @xmath11 . in this approach",
    "the antinucleon - nucleon potential is constructed in the framework of chiral effective field theory @xcite and fitted to results of partial - wave analysis of existing @xmath12 scattering data . as a result predictions of the proton em ffs @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and",
    "also their ratios are in good agreement with existing data up to @xmath15 , i.e. at the region of a validity of the model under consideration .",
    "next intentions of the besiii collab .",
    "are to extend such data measurements for @xmath16 processes , where @xmath17 are hyperons to be members of the @xmath4 octet baryons    @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    in a preparation of such a program it can be useful to dispose with some model predictions for hyperon em ff behaviors and subsequently also of the corresponding differential and total cross - sections .",
    "but the model presented in @xcite is not applicable for such model predictions of hyperon em ffs as it is based on the existence of baryon - antibaryon scattering data , what is unattainable in the case of hyperons .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate a scheme in the framework of which one can do such predictions .",
    "as one can see further , an important role in the prediction of hyperon em ffs play the advanced unitary and analytic ( @xmath26 ) nucleon em structure model , respecting the @xmath3 symmetry and ozi rule @xcite-@xcite violation , then a knowledge of the universal vector - meson coupling constants @xmath5 to be extracted from the experimental values of vector - meson lepton widths    @xmath27    with @xmath28 to be the qed fine structure coupling constant and @xmath29 the vector - meson mass , and a knowledge of the numerical values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 coupling constants in @xmath3 invariant lagrangian    @xmath30(v_\\mu)^\\gamma_\\alpha+\\\\\\nonumber + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}f^d[\\bar{b}^\\beta_\\gamma \\gamma_\\mu b^\\alpha_\\beta+ \\bar{b}^\\alpha_\\gamma\\gamma_\\mu b^\\beta_\\gamma](v_\\mu)^\\gamma_\\alpha+\\\\ \\nonumber + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}f^s \\bar{b}^\\alpha_\\beta \\gamma_\\mu b^\\beta_\\alpha\\omega^0_\\mu\\nonumber \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    describing strong interactions of the nonet of vector - mesons with @xmath4 octet baryons , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are baryon , anti - baryon and vector - meson octuplet matrices and @xmath33 is omega - meson singlet .",
    "the advanced @xmath26 nucleon em structure model represents a harmonious unification of the vector - meson pole contributions and cut structure of em ffs , which represent the so - called continua contributions in nucleon em ffs .",
    "the nucleon em ffs are analytic functions in the whole complex plane of their variable @xmath34 , besides cuts on the positive real axis from the lowest branch point @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the shape of nucleon em ffs is directly related with an existence of complex conjugate pairs of poles on unphysical sheets of the riemann surface in @xmath34-variable , corresponding to unstable true neutral vector - mesons @xcite @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 with the quantum numbers of the photon to be revealed explicitly in the process of electron - positron annihilation into hadrons .    as a result",
    "the complex nature of nucleon em ffs for @xmath46 in time - like region is secured by imaginary parts of the vector - meson poles on unphysical sheets of the riemann surface in @xmath34-variable and the cuts on the positive real axis of the first , so - called physical sheet , of the riemann surface , whereby imaginary part of the em ffs are given by a difference of the ff values on the upper boundary of the cuts and the ff values on the lower boundary of the cuts .",
    "every nucleon electric ff is canonically normalized to the nucleon electric charge and every nucleon magnetic ff is normalized to the nucleon magnetic moment .",
    "all these nucleon em ffs govern the asymptotic behaviors as predicted by the quark model of hadrons to be proven also in the framework of the qcd @xcite .",
    "the advanced @xmath26 nucleon em structure model depends on the coupling constants ratios @xmath47 to be defined for every of nine above - mentioned unstable true neutral vector - mesons in vmd model . however , not all nine of them appear explicitly in the advanced @xmath26 nucleon em structure model as free parameters . in the process of a construction of the vmd model to be automatically normalized and governing the correct asymptotic behavior , some of these coupling constants ratios can be expressed through the table mass values of the true neutral vector - mesons under consideration and other coupling constant ratios . and",
    "just here some freedom exists in the choice , which of the coupling constants ratios @xmath47 will be left as free parameters of the model .",
    "the problem is that not for all nine true neutral vector - mesons under consideration an experimental information on the lepton width @xmath48 exists .",
    "the latter is known @xcite only for ground state vector - mesons @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for all the first and second excited states the rev . of part .",
    "physics @xcite declares , that their lepton decays are seen , but they are not precisely measured experimentally up to now .",
    "just for this reason in the present advanced nucleon em structure model we keep the coupling constant ratios @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and also @xmath52 , @xmath53 , for which some model estimations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 exist @xcite , as free parameters to be determined in comparison of the present advanced nucleon em structure model with all existing data on nucleon em ffs in space - like and time - like regions simultaneously",

    "the em structure of the nucleons ( iso - doublet compound of the proton and neutron ) , as revealed experimentally for the first time in elastic unpolarized electron - proton scattering in the middle of the last century , is completely described by four independent scalar functions , the electric @xmath59,@xmath60 and the magnetic @xmath61 , @xmath62 ffs , dependent of one variable to be chosen as the squared momentum transferred @xmath63 of the virtual photon @xmath64 .",
    "the experimental information on these functions consists of 11 following different sets of data on :    * the ratio @xmath65 in the space - like @xmath66 region from polarization experiments @xcite-@xcite * @xmath67 in the space - like @xmath66 region @xcite * @xmath68 in the time - like @xmath69 region ; only from exp . in which @xmath68=@xmath70 is assumed * @xmath71 in the space - like @xmath66 region @xcite-@xcite * @xmath70 in the time - like @xmath69 region @xcite,@xcite,@xcite-@xcite * @xmath72 in the time - like @xmath69 region @xcite,@xcite * @xmath73 in the space - like @xmath66 region @xcite-@xcite * @xmath74 in the time - like @xmath69 region ; only from exp .",
