    "baryon magnetic moments ( baryon moments for short ) have been studied intensively for many years using different models and approaches @xcite .",
    "it initially appears somewhat surprising that the simple , nonrelativistic quark model ( qm ) @xcite is so good , with more complicated models giving only small improvements in the quantitative description of the baryon moments .",
    "this is now understood .    in our recent work on the connections between the qm and effective field theory @xcite",
    ", we showed that the constituent qm for the baryon moments can be regarded as a rewriting of the relativistic chiral effective field theory ( eft ) in which only the one - body moment operators are retained , a result also obtained by morpurgo using his general parametrization method @xcite derived exactly from qcd .",
    "like morpurgo , we found that the success of the additive qm is due to the numerical dominance of the one - body operators over the nonadditive two- and three - body operators , and suggested why the latter operators should , in fact , be small .    in our earlier dynamical model @xcite ,",
    "an initial baryon moment operator was derived from quenched qcd using the wilson - loop approach of brambilla _ et al .",
    "this appears as a sum of single - particle moments @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kinetic energy of quark @xmath4 , and a set of thomas precession terms connected to the binding interactions . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the further corrections to the baryon moments from from meson loops , which are absent in quenched qcd .",
    "this combined approach substantially improved the agreement between the theory and experiment , leaving an average difference between the theoretical and experimental octet moments of only 0.05@xmath0 .",
    "we did not , however , analyze the components of the model , or its description in eft , in detail .",
    "the central idea in the context of our later work on eft @xcite was to use a dynamical model , namely the qcd - based quark model , to obtain reasonable estimates of the input parameters connected to the one- and higher- body operators in the effective field theory , then to add the meson loop corrections using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "our goals here are ( i ) to present the general structure of the baryon moments in effective field theory , parametrized in a form which connects easily to dynamical ideas ; ( ii ) to analyze the contributions of meson loops and the dynamical qcd corrections in terms of the eft ; ( iii ) sketch the relevant parts of our dynamical calculations , including our analysis of the contributions of low - lying angular excitations ; and ( iv ) to show how the loop and dynamical corrections combine to give a good description of the moments . items ( ii ) and ( iii ) involve the structure of the wave functions used to estimate the dynamical corrections , so we give their form and the methods of calculation used .",
    "some of this material is potentially useful in other contexts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ subsec : chiral_moments ] , we briefly review the structure of the baryon moments in the effective field theory , where the qm moments arise from one - body operators . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : background ] we sketch a derivation of the qm moments and further two- and three - body dynamical corrections from qcd using a wilson - loop approach @xcite .",
    "we determine the structure of the @xmath1 baryon wave functions needed to calculate these corrections and develop useful the trace methods for the calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec : wavefuncs ] .",
    "we analyze the contributions of meson loops , the dynamical qcd corrections , and internal orbital angular momenta numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] , and show why both the loop and dynamical corrections are needed to obtain a good description of the data .",
    "we present our conclusions and discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , and give some additional information , such as proofs and sample calculations , in the appendices .",
    "in two earlier papers @xcite , we analyzed the structure of the baryon magnetic moment operators to o(@xmath5 ) in heavy - baryon chiral perturbations theory ( hbchpt ) , connecting the general spin - flavor structure to the spin dependence of the underlying dynamical theory .",
    "the analysis was done using flavor - index labeling of the effective baryon fields @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a dirac spinor index .",
    "the transformation properties of the fields are the same as those of the operators @xmath9 constructed in terms of free quark operators which carry the color , flavor , and spin structure of the baryon .",
    "this expression for the relativistic fields reduces in the rest frame of the heavy baryon to the nonrelativistic structure familiar in the nonrelativistic quark model , @xmath10 and provides a straightforward connection to semirelativistic dynamical models for the baryons .",
    "it also connects directly to morpurgo s general parametrization method for specifying the most general spin and flavor structure of matrix elements in qcd @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the structure in terms of `` quarks '' for convenience , but emphasize that the description is completely equivalent to a relativistic effective field theory .",
    "one- and two - body contributions to the baryon magnetic moments at the quark level .",
    "lines with small wiggles represent photons .",
    "there is a factor @xmath11 in the lagrangian at the quark - photon vertex , where @xmath12 is the external magnetic field .",
    "crosses correspond to factors of the quark charge matrix @xmath13 , and dots to insertions of the flavor matrix @xmath14 .",
    "graphs ( a ) and ( b ) give the su(6 ) structure for the moments . ]",
    "three - body contributions to the baryon magnetic moments .",
    "the two graphs in ( i ) appear together with the same overall coefficient .",
    "the structures in graphs ( h ) and ( i ) are reducible to those in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2](g ) . ]",
    "as shown in @xcite , the octet moments @xmath15 can be written through first order in the chiral symmetry breaking parameter @xmath5 in terms of seven operators @xmath16 which correspond to the the diagrams ( a)-(g ) in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the contribution of the octet moments to the chiral lagrangian for is given to o(@xmath5 ) as a matrix element of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a combination of the quark - level operators @xmath19 @xmath13 is the diagonal quark charge matrix , @xmath20 , and @xmath14 is the diagonal mass matrix for the strange quark , @xmath21 .",
    "a flavor index attached to a @xmath13 or @xmath14 means that the matrices are taken to act on that flavor quark so that , for example , @xmath22 is the matrix element @xmath23 , with @xmath24 acting on quark @xmath4 in the representation in eq .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : fit ]    the advantage of the decomposition in table  [ table : mu_parameters ] is the possible hints it provides for improving the theory . in particular , the most striking deviation of theory from experiment",
    "is in the value of the leading thomas - type term @xmath35 corresponding to fig .  [",
    "fig1](c ) .",
    "this is well determined experimentally , with @xmath36 .",
    "the qm ratio @xmath37 is attained only for @xmath35 small , a result which is `` accidental '' in a general parametrization of the moments @xcite . here",
    "@xmath35 is small because of a cancellation between the meson loop corrections at one loop and the thomas - type correction @xmath38 .",
    "some further input will clearly be needed to obtain better agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the calculated value of the related coefficient @xmath39 , is also significantly different from experiment .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath27 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are dominated by the relatively large uncertainty in the @xmath42 transition moment .",
    "the results nevertheless suggest that the three - body contribution @xmath40 may be overestimated , and the calculated two - strange quark term @xmath41 is too small and of the wrong sign .",
    "we note that baryon mass insertions in the meson loop diagrams , so far not calculated , will affect these contributions @xcite .",
    "we have presented and analyzed the qcd corrections to the baryon magnetic moments in terms of the effective field theory description in terms of `` quark '' operators @xmath43 to be used in baryon matrix elements of the form @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the effective field operator for the baryon in eq .",
    "( [ bijk ] ) .",
    "we have then used the connection of this quark picture to dynamical models @xcite to estimate the input values of the unknown parameters in the chiral expansion using a semirelativistic dynamical model .",
    "this model can be derived in a quenched approximation to qcd @xcite and gives a good description of the baryon spectrum up to @xmath46 gev @xcite .",
    "this allows us to estimate the changes in the leading qm moments in different baryons and binding corrections to the moments identified earlier @xcite , and to study the contributions of orbital angular excitations .",
    "we find that the binding corrections to the simple qm picture of the moments involve , as expected , mainly contributions from the one- and two- body operators , and are important .",
    "the changes in the qm moments in different baryons are significant but small .",
    "the orbital contributions to the moments are completely negligible since the terms in the wave functions which involve higher angular momenta are very small .",
    "the chiral meson loop contributions are large , but tend to cancel with the corresponding parameters for the binding corrections leading to a fairly successful overall fit to the moment data .",
    "fits using the loop corrections alone are much less satisfactory .",
    "the deviations of the calculated parameters @xmath43 from those found in an exact fit to the baryons moments suggests where further input will be important .",
    "we note finally that the procedure used in our construction of the @xmath1 baryon wave functions displays their symmetry properties and the internal angular momentum content very simply , and may be useful in other contexts as may the trace methods used to calculate the many spin matrix elements which appear in the expressions for the magnetic moments .",
