    "that is , @xmath365    as two examples , figure  [ fig37a ] illustrates the complexes @xmath366 for @xmath76 , with @xmath367 and @xmath368 .",
    "the construction is straightforward using equation  [ eqn1b ] and the fact that @xmath350 shifts along the diagonal a distance of @xmath369 down and to the left .",
    "the portion of the complex illustrated was chosen because its homology is @xmath11 in grading 0 and represents the generator of the homology of @xmath370 in grading 0 .",
    "it is apparent from these examples that the alexander filtration is not a filtration of the chain complex , as some arrows increase the alexander filtration level .",
    "however , as is easily verified , the algebraic filtration is a filtration on the chain complex .      the value of @xmath4 as just defined is equal to @xmath374 , where @xmath72 is the least number for which the homology of @xmath375 contains an element of grading 0 which represents a nontrivial element of the homology of @xmath370 .",
    "suppose that using this definition of @xmath4 , we have @xmath182 .",
    "this implies that @xmath376 contains a cycle @xmath154 representing a nontrivial generator of grading 0 in the homology of @xmath370 .",
    "write @xmath377 , where the @xmath378 are filtered generators",
    ". some @xmath378 has filtration level @xmath379 , and none of the @xmath378 has algebraic filtration level greater than @xmath72 .    from the refiltration formula given in equation  [ eqn1b ] , @xmath380",
    ", we see that generators of @xmath2 at filtration level @xmath168 and grading 0 yield generators of grading 0 in @xmath370 at filtration level @xmath381 .",
    "( recall that shifting down to the left by @xmath80 units decreases the grading level by @xmath382 . )",
    "we are thus led to consider the transformation @xmath383 its inverse is given by @xmath384 under this transformation , for a fixed value of @xmath72 , the vertical line @xmath385 , is carried to the line ( in the @xmath2plane ) @xmath386 relabeling the coordinate system @xmath387 , this is the line @xmath388    comparing with equation  [ eqn0 ] , we see that the homology of the filtered complex @xmath389 contains a generator of grading 0 that is nontrivial in the homology of @xmath2 , and that this is not the case for @xmath390 for any @xmath391 . thus , the value of @xmath4 as defined in section  [ sectionu ] is @xmath374 , and the definitions agree ."
