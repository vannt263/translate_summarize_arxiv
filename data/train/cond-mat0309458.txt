    "body effects on the electric transport in small ( either mesoscopic or nanoscopic ) devices . for this purpose , we take the simplest interacting model ( the one  dimensional hubbard model ) connected to metallic leads and develop a precise numerical recipe to obtain results that make physical sense .",
    "let us refer as direct precursor of our work the contributions by maslov and stone@xcite , ponomarenko@xcite and schulz and safi@xcite showing that electrons can traverse a luttinger liquid without suffering scattering .",
    "of particular importance are the works by oguri@xcite which has studied the same model using exact second  order perturbation theory in the interaction concluding that not only transport through a single interacting site shows perfect transmission at half  filling ( symmetric anderson impurity ) but transport through _ any _ odd number of interacting sites .",
    "we will show that our results point to a regular odd / even behavior leading to isolating transport characteristics well described by the existence of a finite energy gap for charge excitations . we will add physical arguments to our numerical results ( see subsection iiib ) .",
    "additional theoretical contributions about transport through 1d hubbard model are collected in ref .",
    "the theoretical method is presented in the next section while results are given in section iii . after checking the numerical method for only one interacting site ( anderson impurity )",
    ", the conductivity of extended interacting systems has been studied both at and below half  filling .",
    "the last section summarizes our findings .",

    "ideal metallic leads are connected to a central part containing the relevant part of the system : interacting electrons in our case .",
    "the evaluation of the current  voltage ( iv ) characteristic of the extended system proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , the central interacting part is exactly solved for a given number of electrons and well  defined electrochemical potential profile by means of lanczos type techniques .",
    "second , keldysh formalism is used to attach _ in an approximate but physically appealing way _ the leads to the central region .",
    "et al._@xcite were probably among the first authors using this kind of direct approach for the calculation of the tunneling current through a non  interacting system .",
    "the extension of the formalism for the current through an interacting electron region was given by meir and wingreen@xcite .",
    "the formalism depends crucially on the knowledge of the many ",
    "body selfenergy describing interaction effects .",
    "our numerical procedure gives a precise recipe for an approximate evaluation of this selfenergy .",
    "the central region is described by a nearest ",
    "neighbors tight  binding hamiltonian with on  site interaction terms among electrons of different spin .",
    "this is the well  known hubbard model :    @xmath2    where the label @xmath3 denotes a generic site in the finite cluster , @xmath4 represents nearest ",
    "neighbors pairs , and @xmath5 gives the number of electrons of spin @xmath6 at site @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of an external electrostatic potential is described by an additional one  electron term :    @xmath7    being @xmath8 the value of electrostatic potential at site @xmath3 .",
    "lanczos method allows the calculation of the groundstate of the finite interacting system for a number of sites equal or smaller than fourteen at half  filling ( computation is sometimes feasible for larger number of sites when a smaller number of electrons is considered or system symmetries are explicitly used ) .",
    "once the groundstate is known , a continued fraction expansion of the green functions in a lanczos type basis allows their evaluation as a function of energy ( see the review by dagotto@xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "in fact , the four green functions entering into keldysh formalism are explicitly calculated in this way@xcite .",
    "a matrix form with site and keldysh indices will be used for the whole set of green functions of the finite cluster@xcite :    @xmath9    notice that the @xmath10dependence of green functions is not shown in order to keep notation clearer .",
    "green functions of the extended system ( interacting central part plus electrodes ) are obtained by means of a dyson equation .",
    "leads are described by a constant density of states equal to the one at the bandcenter of a non  interacting chain with a hopping equal to @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the green function at the right end ( site @xmath12 ) of the left electrode is :    @xmath13    for energies below the chemical potential @xmath14 of this electrode and :    @xmath15    for energies above @xmath14 .",
    "dyson equation is used to couple the central part to the leads _ when _",
    "@xmath16 :    @xmath17    being the only non  zero elements of the hopping term @xmath18 the following :    @xmath19    which couple the first site @xmath20 of the finite system to the left electrode and    @xmath21    coupling the last site @xmath22 of the central part to the right electrode . in this way ,",
    "the non  interacting non ",
    "equilibrium keldysh green functions of the extended system @xmath23 can be obtained from the @xmath16 solution of the central part @xmath24 .",
    "body interactions are added to @xmath23 by means of a second dyson equation :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 contains all contributions coming from the hubbard interaction in ( [ hubbard ] ) .",
    "it is numerically obtained as the difference between the non  interacting green function inverse and the one including @xmath0 effects :    @xmath27^{-1 } - [ \\mathbf{g } ( u)]^{-1 }   \\qquad . \\label{dyson2}\\ ] ]    this equation contains all the approximations needed to get the transport properties of the extended many  body system .",
    "they are : i ) although @xmath26 is spatially localized ( remember that interaction is restricted to the central part ) , correlation among electrons visiting distant parts of electrodes is not taken into account .",
    "ii ) the detailed form of the electrostatic potential inside the sample is not known .",
    "iii ) averages within the central part are evaluated using the equilibrium groundstate of the cluster .",
    "they may be changed by the presence of an important potential bias inducing a large current through the sample .",
    "notice the quite different character of the three approximations we are using to get well  defined transport properties through the interacting system .",
    "the first one is just a computational limitation that can be eventually overcome with larger mainframes allowing the inclusion of part of the electrodes until convergence of the selfenergy could been reached .",
    "the second one is physically more relevant and has to do with hartree consistency along the system .",
    "although a charge ",
    "dependent term could be added to eq .",
    "( [ hubbard ] ) and iteratively solved , we think that given the unrealistic one  dimensional nature of the model this could lead to numerical difficulties not directly related to physical properties",
    ". therefore , we have preferred the inclusion of an arbitrary fixed form for the electrochemical potential inside the sample and just checked that our main results do not depend qualitatively on the selected profile .",
    "the third one is actually _ the _ approximation of this method .",
    "naively , one can think that the many ",
    "body state of the interacting part when a current is flowing is not related to any state of the isolated system nor even to an easy combination of the groundstate with some excited states . since the selfenergy defined by eq .",
    "( [ dyson2 ] ) directly depends on the state used to calculate green functions , one should conclude that this is just an uncontrolled approximation that has to be validated _ a posteriori _ once results make sense .",
    "alternatively , many  body contributions to the selfenergy can be calculated by perturbation theory . typically , just the second order diagram is considered@xcite .",
    "simultaneous use of equations ( [ keldysh ] ) , ( [ dyson ] ) and ( [ dyson2 ] ) gives the main working equation of this paper :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is an approximate keldysh green function of the non  equilibrium many  body extended system .",
    "( [ keldysh2 ] ) has been recently used for the study of bohm - aharonov and persistent currents through quantum dots in the kondo regime and the transport in coupled quantum dots@xcite .",
    "seminal works using similar ideas to gather exact solutions of small many  body systems into a lattice are much older@xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the global keldysh green function is :    @xmath30    any interesting physical magnitudes can be obtained from it .",
    "for example , the density of states at site @xmath3 is :    @xmath31    assuming spin degeneracy .",
    "if not the case , the spin label should be explicitly considered doubling the size of the green function matrices . apart from this technical complication ,",
    "the spin  dependent formalism remains exactly the same .    the occupied part is directly taken into account by the non  diagonal part of the keldysh green function formalism .",
    "therefore , the charge on site @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath32    in the same way , the current flowing from left electrode to the first site in the central cluster labeled by @xmath20 is :    @xmath33    differential conductance is obtained as the derivative of the current versus voltage curve :    @xmath34    and will be plotted as a function of the energy window @xmath35 opened by the source ",
    "drain voltage @xmath36 . in the particular case",
    "in which voltage does not change the electrostatic potential inside the interacting region , @xmath37 will coincide with the function inside integral ( [ cur ] ) .",
    "this magnitude gives ( apart from a constant ) the transmission as a function of band energy for a one  electron problem but differs from it in a general case due to the inclusion of inelastic effects . at zero bias ,",
    "differential conductance and conductance are equal and can be straightforwardly compared with conductance values obtained within linear response theory :    @xmath38    where green functions are evaluated at the equilibrium chemical potential energy @xmath39 .",
    "the numerical method described in the previous section is still not fully determined . before giving the results that we believe better",
    "describe the physical problem , we have to give the details that allow the calculation of a unique current ",
    "voltage ( iv ) characteristic for the problem .     for several @xmath0 values ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the inset shows the resonance width as a function of @xmath41 in a log ",
    "log representation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the first issue is the value of the electrostatic potential entering into the central part@xcite .",
    "ideally , one could use poisson equation to get the potential from a knowledge of the charge distribution .",
    "this would imply a self  consistent calculation involving the whole system formed by electrodes and interacting part .",
    "as said before , the one  dimensional character of the problem adds both technical and physical complications to the problem . as a consequence ,",
    "we have preferred the use of a model potential profile that is numerically convenient and does not bias the results .",
    "two choices have been tried , either a constant potential inside the central part ( that implies potential discontinuities at the boundaries ) or a linear form matching the value of the potential at electrodes .",
    "the first one seems more appropriate for a metallic situation in which the electric field inside the sample vanishes whereas the second choice could describe an isolating behavior that allows the formation of a large electric field inside the central part .",
    "notice that both choices imply the accumulation of charge at the electrode boundaries .",
    "results for the first choice will be presented in the paper although checks have systematically been run to assure that conclusions are model independent .     and",
    "several values of the impurity level from @xmath42 to @xmath11 are given by squares ( open for a central cluster made by seven sites and filled for the larger cluster formed by eleven sites ) and compared with the exact result based on the friedel  langreth sum rule ( continuous line).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the second issue has to do with the correct description of the interfaces between electrodes and sample .",
    "since our main approximation to the many  body nature of the problem comes from the use of a selfenergy obtained for a finite system , the inclusion of one or more non  interacting sites within this finite part seems appropriate .",
    "unfortunately , the correct description of a wide band metal requires more than one orbital per site and a precise model for the one ",
    "electron hopping elements .",
    "note that the use of a hamiltonian like ( [ hubbard ] ) with @xmath16 for the electrodes could produce important deviations from correct results .",
    "for example , when electrons traverse the interacting part through the upper hubbard band at energies around @xmath0 , the electrode should have finite density of states at this energy to allow electronic transport .",
    "this is not the case for the chain model with a band between @xmath43 and @xmath44 when @xmath0 is large enough ( @xmath45 suffices ) .",
    "the same happens at half  filling when a kondo  like resonance allows good electronic transmission at @xmath46 . in this work in which methodology primes over real world",
    ", we will use electrodes described by a single band of @xmath47 width _ but _ conveniently shifted to allow the electronic current coming from the interacting part@xcite .",
    "therefore , when some part of the electrodes is included in the heavy part of the calculation , atomic levels will be @xmath48 when transport is through the lower hubbard band , @xmath0 when transport is through the upper hubbard band and , @xmath46 at half  filling when resonances within the gap could eventually allow the charge transit .",
    "non  interacting sites included in the lanczos part of the calculation will be referred as interface region or salvage sites in the rest of the paper .    .",
    "circles ( squares ) give results for even ( odd ) number of sites values @xmath22 while the diamond gives the exact value of lieb and wu corresponding to infinite @xmath22 .",
    "straight lines have been obtained by linear regression to the numerical data.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    now , we are prepared to list the numerical steps that are followed to get the current - voltage characteristic of an arbitrary system .",
    "first , the groundstate for a given cluster occupation is obtained and , second , the tridiagonal form of all needed green functions is evaluated .",
    "third , the chemical potential of the finite cluster is obtained from two additional groundstate lanczos calculations for one more and one less particle ( the arithmetic mean is actually used ) .",
    "fourth , the external voltage difference @xmath36 is divided in equal parts that are added ( subtracted ) to the chemical potential ( the one obtained in the previous step ) of the left ( right ) electrodes .",
    "five , eq . ( [ keldysh2 ] ) is used to obtain the keldysh green function that provides the non  equilibrium description of the coupled system . with these ingredients ,",
    "application of eq .",
    "( [ cur ] ) allows the calculation of the current  voltage characteristic of the whole system .",
    "although straightforward and non  biased , the sketched numerical recipe implies non  checked approximations .",
    "the results presented in subsections b and c provide some credibility to the method because they are physically meaningful and consistent .",
    "nevertheless , we have conducted a more specific test for just a one site system : the one  dimensional anderson impurity problem .      in this problem only electrons at one particular site labeled @xmath48 suffer interaction via a hubbard term .",
    "both the one  electron energy of this particular level and its hopping to nearest ",
    "neighbors are usually different from the rest :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 everywhere except at the impurity site . in effect , @xmath51 have been taken as representative of a weakly connected dot with more or less relevant many ",
    "body interactions given by @xmath0 .    notice that hamiltonian ( [ kondoham ] ) describes an infinite chain while hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) in iia refers to a finite cluster .",
    "our theoretical method is easily adapted to this problem considering the interacting site plus some additional sites at each side as the finite system while the remaining semiinfinite chains are now the electrodes .",
    "firstly , the system has been studied at half  filling , i.e. , when just one electron occupies the central site .",
    "this happens when the impurity level @xmath52 lies at @xmath53 .",
    "one or more salvage sites have been added to each impurity side to allow the coupling of the spin at the impurity with the spin of the conduction band electrons .",
    "an odd number of non  interacting sites should be added to each site of impurity to allow the coupling among band states at its center and the impurity level at the same energy .",
    "since the hopping between impurity and lateral chains is usually much smaller than @xmath11 , even number of salvage sites giving states in @xmath54 pairs do not couple appreciably to the impurity and are useless for our purpose . in this way",
    ", we typically end with a system formed by an odd number of sites with and odd number of electrons .",
    "the corresponding groundstate is a doublet .",
    "we take care of the spin degeneracy of the groundstate including a spin index in all green function matrices that consequently double their dimension .",
    "doing so , final results do not depend on the particular linear combination chosen as the groundstate .",
    "it is well  known that a sharp resonance develops at the fermi energy giving rise to perfect transmission through the one site cluster ( kondo resonant tunneling@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ kondo2.ps ] shows this resonance and how it becomes narrower as interaction @xmath0 increases .",
    "although differential conductance has been plotted as a function of the conducting energy window @xmath35 , results for the spectral weight on the impurity site are very similar .",
    "the results shown in the figure have been obtained for a finite cluster formed by eleven sites with the impurity at its center after connecting the electrodes . while the @xmath0 dependence of the resonance width follows the correct trend , an exponentially narrowing of the resonance is not obtained . actually , the width of the resonance follows a @xmath55 law that is shown in the inset of the figure .",
    "secondly , the system has been displaced from half  filling varying the impurity level .",
    "the number of electrons in the cluster is fixed by the chemical potential of the metallic band . typically , we have one electron on every system site except at the impurity which occupation per spin varies from 0 to 1 as its level moves from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "transmission at the fermi level is close to 1 when occupation is close to @xmath58 and decreases rapidly when the number of electrons on the impurity site changes .",
    "the precise relationship between charge and conductance is determined by the friedel ",
    "langreth sum rule ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref . ( ) and ref .",
    "( ) . when the impurity is symmetrically coupled to both semiinfinite chains , the relation is given by :    @xmath59    figure [ langreth.ps ] gives results for clusters formed by seven and eleven sites connected to half  filled electrodes .",
    "here , the value of @xmath0 is always @xmath60 while the impurity level takes values between @xmath42 and @xmath11 .",
    "it can be seen that the fulfillment of the exact relation is excellent regardless the number of sites used to obtain the many  body selfenergy@xcite .",
    "we conclude that the anderson impurity is well described by our numerical procedure even though a naive estimation of the extension of correlations suggest many more sites than included in the exact cluster calculation .",
    "notice that although correlation selfenergy is local , it produces long distance effects well within the semiinfinite chains .",
    "pictorially , one can say that any state coming from one electrode suffers scattering by the many ",
    "body selfenergy at the impurity site when traveling to the other electrode . in our scheme ,",
    "correlation effects among these extended states just come from the components that they have on the finite cluster states that are exactly described by the lanczos computation .",
    "half  filling of the hubbard model happens when the number of electrons equals the number of sites .",
    "half  filled hubbard model is an isolator because charge excitations occur through an energy gap which is of the order of @xmath0 for large interaction values@xcite .",
    "this exact result proved by lieb and wu using the bethe ansatz is easily recovered by a finite cluster calculation both for even and odd number of sites ( and a corresponding equal number of electrons ) in spite of the apparent difficulty of dealing with an odd number of electrons in half the cases . when the number of sites is odd , either an up spin electron or a down spin electron is unpaired but for any choice the total density of states shows a gap .",
    "partial up spin and down spin densities of states are different but share the same gap feature .",
    "integration of these densities of states up to the gap gives the number of up and down spin electrons really present in the system .",
    "fig.([molina2.eps ] ) shows an example density of states for eleven interacting sites while fig.([thegap.ps ] ) shows how the gap scaling toward the exact lieb and wu result proceeds .",
    "results for clusters formed by even or odd number of sites and electrons scale along different straight lines that converge to the same limit .",
    "the gap is systematically smaller for the spin degenerate case .",
    "if one finds a spin polarized groundstate ( and consequently , a spin polarized density of states ) uncomfortable , a mixed groundstate can be formed as a linear combination of @xmath61 and of @xmath62 states and spin polarization disappears when the weight of both components equals .",
    "the gap in the density of states does not change .",
    "this behavior has a very simple physical explanation that has very important consequences for transport properties .",
    "no matter the spin of electrons , the energy cost for one less or one more electron within the system is about @xmath0 at half  filling because every site is occupied by just one electron .",
    "transport of electrons through the system implies a change of 1 in the number of electrons of the system and consequently an energy cost of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "electrons having just a bit more energy than the chemical potential in a d.c .",
    "experiment are unable to traverse the cluster .",
    "more precisely , the green function of the coupled system develops exponential tails within the hubbard cluster and conductance should scale toward zero for large enough systems .",
    "our results below give a detailed description of this situation .    .",
    "curves correspond to system lengths @xmath22 from 2 ( top ) to 12 ( bottom ) in steps of two sites .",
    "the exponential dependence on chain length is manifested by the parallelism of current  voltage curves at voltages below the charge gap .",
    "the same trend is followed at other @xmath0 values although the exponential scaling of the current begins at larger lengths for smaller interactions.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    previous paragraph has shown that odd clusters have nothing special in spite of spin degeneracy . therefore , it is quite surprising that oguri@xcite claims perfect transmission through interacting clusters formed by an odd number of sites larger than one based -at least partially- in spin degeneracy .",
    "notice that the only way of getting perfect transmission is the presence of a state ( or resonance ) at the chemical potential , i.e. , at the gap center in the symmetric case . while this state is absent in an exact cluster calculation",
    ", it is present in oguri s green functions because an odd number of one  electron states implies a state at the bandcenter and the exact but just second  order perturbation theory in the electron repulsion @xmath0 that he performs is unable to open a gap . precisely , this was the reason given by oguri for his result in the first paper of the series@xcite .",
    "what is then the physical reason for perfect transmission across _",
    "one _ interacting site ( anderson resonance ) but not for three or more interacting sites ?",
    "although not a mathematical argument there is a simple reason for this behavior : states in the whole system can be classified as even or odd according to their reflection symmetry relative to the central atom of the interacting region .",
    "when this region is formed by a single atom _ but only _ in this particular case , odd states do not couple to the interaction .",
    "then a fermi picture for the whole interacting groundstate is possible in which some of the occupied states are purely one  electron states .",
    "if the last occupied state corresponds to one of these states , perfect transmission appears .",
    "this is always the case for an extended system but just happens in our finite cluster calculations when the number of odd states is odd and one of these purely one  electron states defines the fermi level .",
    "this means 1 + 1 + 1 ( the first integer gives the number of sites at the left side of the interacting region , the second one is the number of interacting sites and , the last integer the number of sites at the right side of the interacting region ) , 3 + 1 + 3 , ... systems but not 2 + 1 + 2 , 4 + 1 + 4 , as we have seen in section iiia . as a direct consequence of this naive picture of the real complex",
    "body groundstate , it is clear that the number of electrons that occupy the non  interacting state at the chemical potential can be 0 , 1 or 2 without energy change .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case for the clusters used in iiia ( the actual multiplicity of the cluster groundstate is four : one spin doublet for which number of electrons and sites coincide , a spin singlet with one extra electron and a second spin singlet with one less electron ) .",
    "this situation directly leads to a green function showing a zero energy _ charge _",
    "excitation that explains the appearance of perfect transmission . summarizing our point of view",
    ", there is a nice physical reason for perfect transmission across one interacting site but the persistence of perfect transmission across large interacting regions contradicts the insulating character proved for the hubbard model by lieb and wu@xcite .",
    "let us come back to a detailed numerical study of transport through half  filled systems once the overall incorrectness of oguri results has been shown .",
    "based on familiar results of a standard one  electron isolating material , one can naively think that current ",
    "voltage characteristic will show an activated behavior for voltage values above the charge excitations gap .",
    "in fact , this is the result if the selfenergy corresponding to a pure finite hubbard chain is used in the transport equation ( [ cur ] ) .",
    "it should be so since the many  body selfenergy entering into the global green function describes the charge gap .",
    "this behavior does not change if one or more salvage sites are added to each side of the cluster that is numerically solved .",
    "nevertheless , scaling proceeds differently for clusters formed by an even number of sites ( and electrons ) which groundstate is a singlet and clusters of odd numbers of sites ( and electrons ) which groundstate is a doublet . in the last case",
    ", we can speak of kondo  like systems that show a tendency to form resonances with good transmission properties at the chemical potential energy @xmath46 .",
    "just to give a first example , figure [ ejemplo.ps ] shows the qualitative change in the transport properties of kondo  like clusters when interface sites are or are not included in the selfenergy calculation : while the conductance of the system that completely ignores the electrodes has a minimum at the chemical potential due to the formation of a pseudogap , transmission is almost maximum over a large energy range when one electrode site is included at each side .",
    "physically , this result can be interpreted saying that the unpaired electron of the small cluster forms a singlet with the band state at the chemical potential _ only _ if some electrode sites are included in the calculation of the correlation selfenergy .",
    "we will begin showing the behavior of the simpler systems ( even number of sites ) and come back to the degenerate case ( odd number of sites ) at the end of the subsection .",
    "dependence of the current  voltage curves at half  filling for a system of fixed size ( twelve sites ) .",
    "@xmath0 goes from @xmath11 ( upper line ) to @xmath63 ( lower line ) in @xmath11 steps . as in the previous figure ,",
    "the exponential dependence is manifested by the parallelism of current  voltage curves at voltages below the charge gap .",
    "this happens for an @xmath0 value larger than @xmath64 for this system size .",
    "the systematic gap enlargement due to the increasing value of @xmath0 is also shown by the figure.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    size scaling of the problem at hand is shown in figure [ scalingl.ps ] .",
    "current  voltage curves have been obtained for hubbard chains of increasing length ( from two to twelve sites ) and interaction @xmath65 .",
    "the number of electrons in the chain equals the number of sites .",
    "the chemical potential is exactly @xmath46 in this situation .",
    "figure [ scalingl.ps ] shows an exponential decrease of the current as a function of the length of the interacting part : @xmath66 which implies @xmath67 the linear @xmath22 dependence in the logarithmic scale can be observed for any value of the potential below the gap ( which is about @xmath68 for @xmath65 ) .",
    "this exponential scaling law is valid for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , a large enough interacting region completely prohibits current below the gap energy at half  filling .",
    "dependence of the gap at half  filling for a system of fixed size ( twelve sites ) .",
    "the data of previous figure are plotted here in linear  linear scale : @xmath0 increases from @xmath11 to @xmath63 in @xmath11 steps for curves from left to right .",
    "current  voltage characteristics show here in a more clear fashion the activated behavior of current for voltage values above the gap charge.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ scalingu.ps ] shows the @xmath0 dependence of a system formed by twelve sites . from top to bottom the iv curves for @xmath41 values from 1 to 8 ( in steps of one unity ) have been plotted .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath0 dependence is quite similar to the previously seen @xmath22 dependence .",
    "as before , current exponentially vanishes as a function of @xmath0 ( for @xmath0 values larger than @xmath64 at this size ) for any potential value below the charge gap .",
    "the same data have been plotted in figure [ gapu.ps ] in a linear  linear scale to emphasize the behavior of the current for energies above the gap .",
    "it can be seen that an almost linear increase of almost maximum conductance slope takes place regardless the value of @xmath0 .",
    "that means that electrons can enter the interacting system at energies in the lower hubbard band and exit at energies corresponding to the upper hubbard band suffering just a small amount of scattering .",

    "our results show the appearance of a pseudogap for the smaller @xmath0 value and a well - developed gap for @xmath70 ( larger than the one  electron bandwidth ) while oguri results for this size are similar to the ones for the smaller system .",

    "site system shows that our calculated transmission at the bandcenter is not 1 ( as has been discussed before ) although values close to 1 are reached at other energies .    the size dependence followed by spin  degenerate clusters",
    "is exemplified in figure [ summum.ps ] . from top",
    "to bottom the size of the interacting part is increased from one site to seven sites .",
    "it is evident that transmission rapidly diminishes with system size : in effect , the result at the bottom shows narrow resonances in a developing gap ( dashed line gives the result excluding electrode sites , i.e. , avoiding the formation of singlet cluster  band states ) .",
    "figure [ chiappe.ps ] shows the dependence on the number of salvage sites included in the lanczos finite cluster calculation .",
    "conductance at zero bias is given for two , three , five and seven interacting sites for cluster sizes up to fourteen sites . while the addition of salvage sites somewhat diminishes the conductance through two interacting sites , it increases the conductance of systems formed by an odd number of sites .",
    "numerical data have been fitted by parabolas both for simplicity and because an @xmath71 fit has been quite successful describing the gap formation ( see fig.([thegap.ps ] ) .",
    "although an extrapolated value of 1 can not be excluded for the three sites result , it seems quite difficult that the data for five and seven sites ( two lower parabolas ) extrapolate to 1 .    .",
    "from top to bottom : one , three , five and seven interacting sites plus one salvage site at each cluster side .",

    "larger @xmath0 values accelerate the scaling . at the end ,",
    "no odd  even differences survive .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the correct treatment / scaling of kondo  like systems ( formed by any odd number of impurities ) requires much more care since results for small systems strongly depend on the details ( presence or not of salvage sites , the precise description of these _ metallic _ sites , the number of them , etc . ) .    at this point ,",

( [ keldysh2 ] ) is used to get approximate green functions of the infinite connected system .",
    "linear response conductances are obtained from non  diagonal keldysh green functions at the chemical potential which is zero at half  filling ( see eq .",

    "figure [ fit.eps ] shows our results for @xmath0 values 2 ( circles ) and 4 ( squares ) together with polynomial extrapolations to the limit of a large number of salvage sites .",
    "conductance strongly depends on the even / odd character of the number of extra sites added to each side of the chain .",
    "therefore , regression should take care of this particularity but converges to a more or less well  defined value .",
    "our extrapolated conductances nicely agree with the values obtained for rings for both @xmath0 values . actually , the oscillatory convergence of the conductance to the infinite size limit gives additional credibility to the existence of a well  defined finite value of the conductance .",
    "turning now to the case of an odd number of sites @xmath76 and repeating the procedure a first difficulty appears : @xmath79 is not an integer number but an integer number of particles is needed to proceed .",
    "fortunately , groundstate energies for occupations @xmath80 and @xmath81 coincide and a linear combination of both degenerate states with equal weight @xmath82 produces a green function describing perfect half  filling , that is , showing half fermion per site . using the same linear combination ,",
    "exact green functions are obtained for larger clusters that include additional non  interacting sites . showing a behavior quite dissimilar to the one found for the hubbard model , conductance of any of these systems is exactly 1 when connected to leads via the dyson equation .",
    "therefore , conductances for spinless fermions interacting on an odd number of sites perfectly agree with the findings of works ( ) and ( ) . but the initially surprising results have an easy interpretation in view of the strong differences shown by the charge excitation spectra of both model .",
    "figure [ molina2.eps ] compares exact density of states of eleven site clusters described either by the hubbard model ( upper panel ) or by the spinless interacting model ( lower panel ) . in both cases",

    "both are perfectly symmetric around 0 but while the hubbard model shows a clear gap around the chemical potential , the spinless fermions model has a state at this energy .",
    "moreover , even the existence of a well  defined gap is not so clear for this model@xcite .",
    "the zero energy excitation comes from the ambiguous number of particles inside the system , i.e. , one more or one less particle comes into the system without an energy change .",
    "this particular excitation is the responsible -when coupled to the leads- of the perfect transmission at the chemical potential energy . on the other hand , the hubbard model shows just a particle per site at half  filling and a typical cost for adding or removing one electron is @xmath46 . as discussed above , although a dc current can traverse _ small _ hubbard systems , their value systematically diminishes with the size of the system . in short ,",
    "the particular behavior of the spinless interacting system comes precisely by the substitution of the spin degeneration of the hubbard model on systems of an odd number of sites by a charge degeneration that allows charge transport at zero energy cost , i.e. , finite -actually perfect- dc conductance .    in this way",

    "they also give further insight onto the transport of electrons through an interacting region .",
    "for example , the large value of the differential conductance for energies above the gap and its independence on the @xmath0 value comes somewhat as a surprise .",
    "while small scattering is quite plausible for small values of @xmath0 , one could expect large scattering for @xmath0 values as large as twice the one  electron bandwidth .",
    "results for systems away from half  filling are presented in this subsection . in this situation ,",
    "chemical potential is no longer @xmath46 as before and should be obtained for the finite cluster from groundstate calculations with different number of particles .",
    "we define :    @xmath86 @xmath87    where @xmath88 represents the groundstate energy corresponding to @xmath89 particles and take the arithmetic mean of both :    @xmath90    the difference between both estimations is typically very small in this case ( actually both should coincide away from half  filling in a closed hubbard chain@xcite ) .",
    "we always have @xmath91 when the number of particles is smaller than the number of sites .",
    "as said at the beginning of this section , this value of the chemical potential is also assumed for the connected system .",
    "numerical result show that this assumption is internally consistent : total number of electrons in the cluster and their spatial distribution hardly depend on the electrodes presence .",
    "dependence of the current  voltage curves in the metallic regime at one  quarter  filling .",
    "the correlation selfenergy has been obtained for twelve sites and several @xmath0 values .",
    "results for @xmath92 and , @xmath93 are given by dotted , long  dashed , thin and thick curves , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the more important result in the metallic case is the length independence of the transport through the interacting part .",
    "this is shown by fig .",
    "[ quarterl.ps ] for the current through eight , twelve and sixteen hubbard sites at one  quarter filling .",
    "for this comparison , a relatively large value @xmath65 of the interaction has been chosen .",
    "differences between results corresponding to different lengths are probably measuring the typical precision of our approach .",
    "additional numerical calculations not discussed in this paper help to show that all scattering occurs at the system contacts but not inside the interacting region .",
    "let us proceed to the evaluation of the contact resistance and its dependence on @xmath0 and filling factor .     and increasing number of electrons : @xmath94 ( dotted curve ) , 4 ( long  dashed curve ) , 6 ( thin continuous line ) , 8 ( dot  dashed curve ) , and 10 ( thick continuous curve ) .",
    "notice that the last three curves are very close to maximum differential conductance ( slope 1 in the units of the figure).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ quarteru.ps ] gives current  voltage curves for a chain of twelve interacting sites directly connected to metallic electrodes of constant ( and large ) density of states .",
    "the number of electrons within the cluster is always six while @xmath0 increases from @xmath11 to @xmath63 .",
    "scattering at the contacts is always small regardless the large values of @xmath0 included in the figure .",
    "for example , the result for @xmath95 ( twice the corresponding non  interacting bandwidth value ) at @xmath96 can be explained by a transmission coefficient about 0.87 at each interface . actually , the approximate independence on @xmath0 is quite surprising .",
    "figure [ quarterq.ps ] gives current  voltage curves for the same system but varying the number of electrons in the cluster from 2 to 12 in steps of 2 . in all cases a linear characteristic is obtained ( better for small voltages ) but the slope of the curve , i.e. , the differential conductance , _ strongly _ depends on the filling factor ( note that slope of the iv curve is given by the current value at the smaller voltage value in a log  log graph ) . while differential conductance is close to its maximum value of one quantum for large number of electrons ( eight or ten ) , it is much smaller for small filling factors ( two to six electrons in twelve sites ) .",
    "more precisely , average conductance is @xmath97 for two electrons , @xmath98 for four electrons and @xmath99 for six electrons ( one  quarter filling factor ) .",
    "although it is tempting relating these values to experimentally measured values of conductances in clean quantum wires , we think that an improved geometrical model is necessary prior to a realistic comparison with experiments ( for example , the presence of several conducting channels that can be active as a function of the fermi level should be accounted for ) .",
    "moreover , the consideration of long  range interactions among electrons can also change conclusions . in spite of these difficulties for approaching the real world that will be explored in further work",
    ", it seems interesting that the major ( may be the unique ) dependence of transport across an interacting system comes from the filling factor ( from the chemical potential as observed from the electrodes ) and not from the value of the interaction .",
    "a general and computationally convenient method has been implemented for the evaluation of the current  voltage characteristic through interacting regions . the method has been checked studying an isolated anderson impurity in a linear chain .",
    "two main results have been proved for extended hubbard systems .",
    "first , the isolating behavior at half  filling including the possibility of activated transport for voltage values above the gap .",
    "our results confirm the physical picture obtained studying the scaling of the drude peak of half  filled hubbard rings@xcite but disagree in important details from previous studies in the same open geometry@xcite .",
    "for example , kondo  like systems formed by an odd number of impurities show a resonance transmission that decays exponentially with the number of sites .",
    "second , good metallic behavior has been obtained away from half  filling when the number of electrons is large enough . in this case , the interacting region allows ballistic electrons that are just scattered by the contacts between electrodes and the hubbard part .",
    "the value of these contact resistances hardly depends on @xmath0 but shows an important dependence on the filling factor or the chemical potential from a different point of view .",
    "ballistic transport , that is , size independent current for a given voltage , seems to exclude real scattering within the interacting sample and , therefore , exotic consequences of interaction at @xmath1 . although previously reported theoretical estimations of quasi  perfect transmittance@xcite are partially confirmed in this one  dimensional metal",
