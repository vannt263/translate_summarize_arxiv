    "the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has detected 117 rotation - powered pulsars @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented amount of data for these @xmath0-ray sources , allows us to study the statistical properties of the high - energy pulsars through the light - curve analysis . adopting the polar - cap ( pc ) model @xcite , the slot - gap ( sg ) model @xcite , and the outer gap ( og ) model @xcite , and comparing the predicted light - curve morphology with the observations @xcite",
    ", they revealed that the sg model is geometrically favoured in some cases but the og model is in other cases as opposed to the lower - altitude emission models such as the pc model @xcite .",
    "moreover , magic and veritas experiments reported pulsed signals from the crab pulsar up to 400  gev @xcite , which indicates that such very - high - energy photons are probably emitted from the higher altitudes to avoid the strong magnetic absorption that would arise near the polar - cap ( pc ) surface .    in an og ,",
    "created pairs are separated by the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath1 . for middle - aged pulsars",
    ", pairs are mostly created near the inner boundary ; thus , the out - going particles run much longer distance in the og than the in - coming ones , resulting in an order of magnitude greater outward flux than the inward one ( fig .  7 & 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , for relatively young pulsars such as the vela pulsar , the outward @xmath0-ray flux dominates the inward one by only several times @xcite , because the out - going particles run the strong-@xmath1 region several times longer distance than the in - coming ones .",
    "however , such a non - negligible inward flux leads to the light curve that generally exhibits more than two peaks in a single neutron star rotation , which contradicts with observations .    although it is unclear",
    "if the og model does predict a dominant outward @xmath0-ray flux for young or relatively young pulsars , they have assumed so to obtain the observed , double - peaked light curves @xcite .",
    "we are , therefore , motivated by the need to contrive a more consistent og model that quantifies the outward and inward @xmath0-ray fluxes , incorporating the screening effect of @xmath1 by the created and separated charges in the gap .",
    "extending the idea of @xcite , @xcite first solved the set of the non - vacuum poisson equation , boltzmann equations for electrons and positrons ( @xmath2 ) , and the radiative transfer equation simultaneously in a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that a strong @xmath1 does arise between the null - charge surface and the light cylinder ( lc ) , whose distance from the rotation axis is given by the light cylinder radius , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 designates the speed of light and @xmath5 the rotational frequency of the neutron star .",
    "in the present letter , we numerically solve the non - vacuum og electrodynamics in the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) magnetosphere of a typical young pulsar and demonstrate that the outward photon flux naturally dominates the inward ones by virtue of the @xmath1 screening due to the separated motion of the created @xmath2 s . without loss of any generality , we can assume a positive @xmath1 ; in this case , @xmath6 s are accelerated outwards while @xmath7 s inwards , forming an outward current in the og as a part of the global current circuit .",
    "we do not solve the global current closure issue , assuming a starward return current in the magnetic polar regions .",
    "we define the magnetic coordinates in   [ sec : coord ] and describe the 3-d vacuum og model in   [ sec : vac_3d ] .",
    "we then propose the new , 3-d non - vacuum og model in   [ sec : nonvac_3d ] , and discuss some implications of this modern og model in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in a rotating magnetosphere , the poisson equation for the non - corotational potential @xmath8 becomes @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the real charge density and the goldreich - julian ( gj ) charge density is defined by @xmath11 the acceleration electric field can be computed by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the distance along the magnetic field line .    to specify the position in a three - dimensional ( 3-d ) pulsar magnetosphere , it is convenient to introduce the magnetic coordinates ( @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15 ) , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the foot point of the field lines on the neutron star ( ns ) surface .",
    "their relationship with the polar coordinates is given by equations  ( 15)(17 ) of @xcite .",
    "the magnetic azimuthal angle @xmath15 is defined counter - clockwise around the magnetic dipole axis ; @xmath16 points the opposite direction to the rotation axis from the magnetic axis on the two - dimensional poloidal plane in which both the rotation and magnetic axes reside . thus , a negative @xmath15 represents a magnetic field line in the trailing side of a rotating magnetosphere , while a positive @xmath15 does that in the leading side .    as for the magnetic colatitudes",
    "@xmath14 , it is convenient to replace it with the dimensionless trans - field coordinate @xmath17 such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 describes the pc rim , outside of which the magnetic field lines close within the lc . in",
    "what follows , we use the coordinates @xmath20 to specify points in the 3-d magnetosphere . in an og , @xmath1 vanishes on the last - open field line , @xmath21 . in the convex side of the magnetic field lines , @xmath1 increases nearly quadratically with increasing @xmath17 at each ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) , attain the maximum value near the central height @xmath22 , then reduces to vanish above a certain height @xmath23 , which forms the upper boundary of the og . here , the gap trans - field thickness @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath25 in @xcite and @xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "because @xmath1 is screened by the created pairs , we obtain @xmath27 for very young pulsars like the crab pulsar , while @xmath28 for middle - aged pulsars like the geminga pulsar . in the non - vacuum og model , the upper boundary @xmath29 is consistently determined from the separating motion of the charges by the poisson and the boltzmann equations .    to describe the magnetic field , we adopt the vacuum rotating dipole solution @xcite in the entire simulation region .",
    "although this approximation breaks down near and outside the lc @xcite , it properly gives the outward / inward flux ratio at lease qualitatively , because the screening of @xmath1 takes place within the lc .    to solve the poisson equation and the @xmath2 boltzmann equations , we adopt @xmath30 bins in @xmath13 direction ( from the pc surface @xmath31 to @xmath32 along each magnetic field line ) , @xmath33 bins in @xmath17 direction ( from the lower boundary @xmath21 to @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 bins in @xmath15 direction ( from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) ; here , @xmath38 refers to the maximum value of @xmath29 .",
    "the outer boundary of the gap is determined as the free boundary at which @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "for example , if the og is vacuum ( @xmath39 ) and thin ( @xmath40 ) , the outer boundary is located at the inflection point where the poloidal magnetic field con- figuration changes from convex to concave ( eq . [ 68 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "if the og is non - vacuum or thick , we must solve the poisson equation to find the outer boundary . although there is no physical reason why an og outer boundary should be located within the lc ( because the lc is not a special place for any physical process ) ,",
    "we impose that the maximum distance of the outer boundary from the rotation axis is @xmath41 to take a consistency with classic og models . to solve the radiative transfer equation",
    ", we employ the same magnetic coordinates as the poisson and @xmath2 boltzmann equations with coarse grids : @xmath42 bins in @xmath13 direction ( from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ) , @xmath43 bins in @xmath17 direction ( from the lower boundary @xmath21 to @xmath44 , and @xmath35 bins in @xmath15 direction ( from in @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) . in the momentum space",
    ", we adopt @xmath47 bins for the photon energy ( from @xmath48  ev to @xmath49  tev ) , @xmath50 bins for the latitudinal propagation direction ( from @xmath51 to @xmath52 radian ) with respect to the rotation axis , and @xmath53 bins for the azimuthal propagation direction ( from @xmath54 to @xmath52 radian ) .",
    "we employ the minimal cooling scenario ( page et al .",
    "2004 ) , which has no enhanced cooling that could result from any of the direct urca processes and adopts the standard equation of state , apr eos ( akmal et al .",
    "in addition , in this letter , we assume that the ns envelope is composed of heavy elements ( e.g. , fe , co , ni ) with little accretion of light elements ( e.g. , h , he , c , o ) from the atmosphere ; in this case , the gap activity becomes most active @xcite .",
    "we adopt the canonical ns mass of @xmath55 , and the magnetic dipole moment of @xmath56 . in this case",
    ", he ns radius becomes @xmath57  km and the pc magnetic field strength does @xmath58  g. to examine young pulsar emissions , we adopt @xmath59  ms and @xmath60 , which correspond to the ns age of @xmath61  kyr if the spin down is due to the magnetic dipole radiation . to compute the flux ,",
    "we adopt the distance of @xmath62  kpc .",
    "let us first examine a vacuum og in the 3-d pulsar magnetosphere , by solving the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson_1 ] ) under @xmath39 , and by assuming @xmath63 , which is typical for young pulsars around @xmath61  kyr ( within the vacuum og model ) . since the poisson equation is a second - order partial differential equation , and since the gap is transversely thin ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) , @xmath1 distributes quadratically in the trans - field direction , and maximizes at the middle height , @xmath65 .",
    "we plot this maximum value on the last - open - field - line surface , ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) in figure  [ fig : ell_vac ] . in this vacuum og model , the inner ( i.e.",
    ", starward ) boundary is located at the null - charge surface , whose intersection with the last - open - field - line surface is indicated by the white solid curve in figure  [ fig : ell_vac ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath1 peaks in the higher altitudes ( @xmath66 ) , particularly in the leading side ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is because the gj charge density per magnetic flux tube has a greater gradient there compared to the lower altitudes or in the trailing side , as indicated by figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "this result forms a striking contrast to the standard og models , which extends the 2-d solution of @xmath1 on the poloidal plane ( i.e. , at @xmath16 ) into the toroidal direction ( i.e. , to @xmath68 regions ) .",
    "it means that we must solve the poisson equation fully three dimensionally even in the vacuum case .    using this @xmath1",
    ", we can solve the boltzmann equations for @xmath2 s , and the emissivity distribution in the 3-d magnetosphere .",
    "note that in a vacuum og model , the poisson equation is solved separately from the boltzmann equations or the radiative transfer equations .",
    "the particles are accelerated up to the lorentz factors @xmath69 and efficiently emit gev photons via the curvature process mainly within the og , and less efficiently up - scatter the magnetospheric ir - uv photons into tev after escaping from the og , where the ir - uv photons are mostly emitted by the secondary pairs created outside the og via the synchrotron process .",
    "the resultant light curves are plotted in figure  [ fig : res_2b ] for the three discrete viewing angles with respect to the rotation axis , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the solid lines represent the pulse profile of the outward - propagating @xmath0-rays ( emitted by positrons ) , while the dashed ones do that of the inward @xmath0-rays ( emitted by electrons ) .",
    "note that the vacuum og model predicts the detection of the inward emission from the southern og in addition to the conventional outward emission from the northern og .",
    "this forms a contrast to the two - pole caustic / sg model , which predicts the detection of only the outward emissions from the both poles , because the leptonic flux is outwardly uni - directional , and because sufficient emissivity is assumed below the null - charge surface .",
    "since @xmath1 is stronger in the leading side , the leading peak ( p1 ) tends to be stronger than the trailing peak ( p2 ) at many observers viewing angles , @xmath73 .    before escaping from the gap , typical inward - migrating electrons",
    "run @xmath74 , while typical outward - migrating positrons run @xmath75 . as a result ,",
    "outward flux becomes only a few times stronger than the inward flux .",
    "therefore , the light curve in figure  [ fig : res_2b ] generally exhibits more than two peaks in a single ns rotation , which contradicts with the majority of gamma - ray observations .",
    "let us next consider the screening effect due to the separating motion of the created pairs in the gap .",
    "we solve equations ( 43)(55 ) in @xcite under the boundary conditions that @xmath7 s or @xmath6 s do not enter across either the inner or the outer boundaries .",
    "pairs are mainly created when the inward curvature @xmath0-rays collide with the outward thermal x - rays emitted from the ns surface .",
    "the created pairs in the gap are separated to screen @xmath1 to a small amplitude so that the pairs can be marginally separated . in this case",
    ", the real charge density has the same spatial gradient as the gj charge density @xcite along the magnetic field , as indicated by figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "we neglect the magnetic - field deformation due to the magnetospheric currents , adopting the same magnetic field geometry as in section [ sec : vac_3d ] .",
    "because of this screening effect , @xmath1 becomes very weak in the middle and lower altitudes , @xmath76 , as figure  [ fig : res_3a ] shows .",
    "it is also found that the regions that emit photons in p1 and p2 phases ( i.e. , in @xmath77 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig : res_3a ] ) have greater @xmath1 than other regions .",
    "the gap trans - field thickness becomes @xmath79 in most portions of the gap . as a result of this @xmath1 screening , the outward photon flux dominates the inward one , as demonstrated by the light curves in figure  [ fig : res_3e ]",
    "this is because the pairs are mostly created in the middle or the lower altitudes , @xmath76 , which indicates that the positrons experience an efficient acceleration in the strong @xmath1 region in the higher altitudes while the electrons do not .",
    "therefore , the light curve is dominated by the outward photons , which are emitted from the northern og into the southern hemisphere , and tends to exhibit a double - peak pulse profile for a wide range of @xmath73 .",
    "the expected phase - averaged spectrum is plotted for @xmath80 in figure  [ fig : res_3b ] . for comparison ,",
    "we plot the spectrum of the outward and inward photons as the thick and thin curves , respectively .",
    "it is also confirmed from the figure that the gamma - ray flux is predominantly outward . as a result of the superposition of the curvature emission from different places with varying @xmath1 , between 0.16  gev and 1.6  gev ,",
    "the @xmath81 spectrum becomes a power - law with index @xmath82 , which is consistent with the fermi observations of young pulsars . since @xmath1 depends not only on ( @xmath13,@xmath15 ) , but also quadratically on @xmath17 , it is essential to consider the superposition of the emission spectra along different magnetic field lines .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the magnetospheric emission is @xmath83 above 160  mev , while it is @xmath84 below 160  mev .",
    "the heated pc luminosity is @xmath85 . for comparison ,",
    "the spin - down luminosity is @xmath86 , and the cooling ns x - ray luminosity is @xmath87 .",
    "the heated pc flux becomes greater than the magnetospheric x - ray flux if @xmath88 or @xmath89 .    .",
    "the thick lines represent the energy flux of outwardly emitted photons , while the thin ones do that of inward photons .",
    "the black solid , dashed , and dotted curves denote the spectrum of the primary , secondary , and tertiary photons , while the green solid ones do the final spectrum after absorption .",
    "[ fig : res_3b ] ]",
    "in summary , we have numerically examined the pulsar outer gaps , by solving the set of the poisson equation , the @xmath2 boltzmann equations , and the radiative transfer equation from 0.005  ev to 20  tev . applying the method to a young pulsar with @xmath61  kyr age , we find that the acceleration electric field @xmath1 is substantially screened by the separating motion of the created pairs , and that the @xmath0-ray flux becomes predominantly outward due to the localization of @xmath1 in the higher altitudes . to reproduce the observed double - peak light curves , it is essential to solve the outer gap three - dimensionally , taking account of this screening effect .",
    "as figure  [ fig : res_3e ] indicates , the trailing peak has a long tail until the rotational phase of @xmath90  degrees .",
    "this is due to the emission from the trailing - most side of the magnetosphere ( @xmath91 ) from a very high altitudes ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "since the actual strength and direction of such emissions depend on the magnetic - field configuration near the lc , it could be possible to constrain the magnetic field configuration there . figure  [",
    "fig : res_3e ] also shows that there is a strong emission component around @xmath93 ( i.e. , before p2 ) .",
    "this component is suppressed , if we consider a very thin og ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) , as suggested in the standard og or sg models . however , if we solve the set of maxwell - boltzmann equations , we obtain @xmath95 and the broad light curves as presented .",
    "it means that we can not still reproduce the observed flux and sharp pulses simultaneously by the current particle accelerator models .",
    "let us briefly discuss an implication when the minimal cooling scenario with a heavy element envelope breaks down . if the ns envelope contains light elements with mass greatly exceeding @xmath96 , the higher ns surface temperature @xcite leads to a reduction of @xmath24 and hence the og luminosity . on the contrary , if the cooling is dominated by neutrino emission via the direct urca process , the resultant rapid cooling ( in the initial @xmath90  years ) @xcite will lead to an increase of @xmath24 and hence the luminosity . in either case",
    ", we expect that @xmath1 is localized in the higher altitudes in the same way as demonstrated in this letter , by virtue of the strong negative - feedback effects in the og electrodynamics @xcite    since the optical depth for photon - photon pair creation is around unity , the tev photons created via the synchrotron - self - compton process can not be easily absorbed by the magnetospheric ir - uv photons , as indicated by the dashed and thick solid curves in figure  [ fig : res_3b ] .",
    "it suggests that we may expect relatively strong pulsed emissions around tev from the pulsars of which inverse - compton and photon - photon - absorption optical depths are around unity , which is typical for young pulsars with ages around several thousand years .",
    "we will discuss this possibility in a separate paper .",
