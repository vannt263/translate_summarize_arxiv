    "the phenomenological success of the standard model ( sm ) has significantly limited the possibility of new physics except for the higgs sector which remains untested .",
    "there are numerous speculations on the possible extensions of the higgs sector , among which the simplest is to introduce one more higgs doublet . compared with the sm",
    ", such simple two - higgs doublet models usually have much more complicated higgs phenomenology . in the sm",
    "a single higgs doublet is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking and the higgs couplings with fermions and gauge bosons are completely determined by their masses , and therefore there is little guesswork in determining the discovery channels for the higgs boson @xcite . in the two - higgs doublet models , however , the addition of new scalars and the modification of the higgs interactions will significantly complicate the higgs discovery at the lhc @xcite .",
    "given the imminent running of the lhc , the phenomenological study of various such models is urgently important .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a special two - higgs doublet model called the lepton - specific two - higgs doublet model ( l2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "since this model is arguably well motivated from some fundamental theory and also has some phenomenological virtues ( e.g. , it can provide a natural explanation for the leptonic cosmic ray signals reported by pamela and atic @xcite ) , it has attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "we will check various constraints on the model parameters and then scrutinize the property of the higgs bosons in the allowed parameter space .",
    "these constraints come from the precision electroweak data , the direct search for higgs boson , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , as well as some theoretical consistency requirements .",
    "our main observation is that in the allowed parameter space the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 must be light ( @xmath9 30 gev with @xmath2 possibility ) , which is composed dominantly by the leptonic higgs and decays dominantly into @xmath10 ; while the sm - like higgs boson @xmath4 ( responsible largely for electroweak symmetry breaking ) decays dominantly in the mode @xmath11 with a decay width usually exceeding several tens of gev , which may make the higgs discovery more difficult at the lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recapitulate the l2hdm model . in sec .",
    "iii we examine various constraints on the parameter space and study the properties of the higgs bosons in the allowed parameter space . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we give our conclusion .",
    "the l2hdm is a special two - higgs doublet model in which one higgs doublet @xmath12 couples only to leptons while the other doublet @xmath13 couples only to quarks .",
    "both higgs doublets contribute to the electroweak symmetry breaking : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being respectively the vacuum expectation values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; whereas their relative contributions can be quite different and can be parameterized by the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "so for a large @xmath18 the lepton yukawa couplings can be greatly enhanced .",
    "the yukawa interactions and the higgs potential are given by @xcite @xmath19 , \\label{eq : vstandard}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are generation indices , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath24 yukawa matrices , @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote respectively the the left - handed quark and lepton fields , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote respectively the right - handed up- and down - type quark fields , @xmath29 denotes the right - handed lepton fields , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters .    just like the usual two - higgs doublet model @xcite , the spectrum of the higgs sector includes three massless goldstone modes , which become the longitudinal modes of @xmath32 and @xmath33 bosons , and five massive physical states : two @xmath34-even states @xmath4 and @xmath35 ,",
    "a pseudoscalar @xmath0 , and a pair of charged states @xmath36 .",
    "these states are related to the doublets @xmath12 and @xmath13 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mixing angle that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs fields .    due to the constraint @xmath39 , the eight free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vstandard ] ) , i.e. , @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( i=1,2,3 ) , reduce to seven . in our analysis",
    "we choose the following seven parameters as the input parameters of the l2hdm : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the masses of the corresponding physical states . throughout this paper",
    ", we use @xmath35 ( @xmath4 ) to denote the higgs boson with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) as its dominant component , which means that we choose @xmath50 .",
    "the interactions of the higgs physical states with fermions are then given by @xcite @xmath51 obviously , for a large @xmath52 the lepton yukawa couplings are greatly enhanced relative to the sm prediction .",
    "one can also check that the couplings of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 which satisfy the sum rule @xmath56 . for a large @xmath52 ( this is the case required by the experimental constraints , as shown below ) , the coupling @xmath53 is dominant over @xmath54 , so @xmath4 is usually called the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "we note that both the theoretical consistency and the electroweak data have limited the parameter space of the l2hdm . in our study we consider the following theoretical constraints :    * the perturbativity is valid in the higgs sector , which requires @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . *",
    "the @xmath59-matrix satisfies all relevant tree - unitarity constraints , which implies that the quartic couplings @xmath40 satisfy @xcite @xmath60 * the scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vstandard ] ) is finite at large field values and contains no flat directions , which translate into the bounds @xcite @xmath61    on the experimental side , we consider the following constraints :    * the lower mass bound on the charged higgs bosons : @xmath62 gev @xcite . * the constraints from the lep search for neutral higgs bosons .",
    "we compute the signals from the higgsstrahlung production @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) with @xmath65 @xcite and from the associated production @xmath66 with @xmath67 @xcite and compare them with their lep data .",
    "we also consider the constraints from @xmath63 by looking for a peak of @xmath68 recoil mass distribution of @xmath33-boson @xcite and the constraint of @xmath69 mev when @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "* the constraints from the lep search for a light higgs boson via the yukawa process @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath59 denoting a scalar @xcite .",
    "these constraints can limit @xmath73 coupling versus @xmath74 and thus can constrain the parameters of the l2hdm . * the constraints from the @xmath75-boson mass . the l2hdm higgs sector can shift the @xmath75-boson mass through radiative corrections .",
    "we require the corrected @xmath75-boson mass to lie within the @xmath76 range of the global - fit value .",
    "the sm prediction for the @xmath75-boson mass is 80.363 gev for @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 gev @xcite , and its fitted value is @xmath79 gev @xcite .",
    "we use the formula in @xcite in calculating the mass and consider the effect of a different top quark mass ( in our calculation we take @xmath80 gev ) .",
    "we also subtract the contribution from the sm higgs boson to avoid double counting the contribution from the higgs sector .",
    "* the constraints from @xmath81 coupling .",
    "for a large @xmath18 the l2hdm higgs sector can give sizable radiative corrections to @xmath81 coupling .",
    "we calculate such corrections and require the corrected @xmath81 coupling to lie within the @xmath82 range of its fitted value . the sm prediction for this coupling at @xmath33-pole",
    "is given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite , and the fitted value given respectively by @xmath85 and @xmath86@xcite .",
    "we use the formula in @xcite in our calculation . * the constraints from @xmath87 leptonic decay .",
    "we require the l2hdm correction to the branching ratio @xmath88 to be in the range of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we use the formula in @xcite in our calculation . * the constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath90 . now both the theoretical prediction and the experimental measured value of @xmath90",
    "have reached a remarkable precision , but a significant deviation still exists : @xmath91 @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we require the l2hdm to account for such difference at @xmath82 level .",
    "note that in the l2hdm , @xmath90 gets additional contributions from the one - loop diagrams induced by the higgs bosons and also from the two - loop barr - zee diagrams mediated by @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath35 @xcite . if the higgs bosons are not too light , the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams are more important . to account for the discrepancy of @xmath90",
    ", one needs a light @xmath0 along with a large @xmath18 to enhance the effects of the barr - zee diagram involving the @xmath87-loop .",
    "the cp - even higgs bosons are usually preferred to be heavy since their contribution to @xmath90 is negative . *",
    "since the cp - odd higgs @xmath0 can be quite light and @xmath92 may open up with a large decay width , we require the width of any higgs boson in the l2hdm to be smaller than its mass ( otherwise the higgs boson may be too fat ) .    with the above constraints , we scan the parameter space of the l2hdm in the ranges : @xmath93    with @xmath94 random samplings , we get the allowed parameter space shown in figs.1 - 2 .",
    "fig.1 shows that the allowed parameter space has a light @xmath0 ( @xmath95 gev ) and a large @xmath18 ( @xmath96 ) , which mainly comes from the explanation of the @xmath90 discrepancy . among the surviving samples displayed in fig.1 , about @xmath97",
    "satisfy @xmath1 gev and about @xmath98 satisfy @xmath99 gev , which means that a very light @xmath0 is highly preferred by the constraints .",
    "fig.2 shows the allowed parameter space projected in the planes of @xmath44 and @xmath46 versus @xmath100 .",
    "three characters should be noted about this figure .",
    "the first is that all the higgs bosons are lighter than 350 gev ( lighter than 250 gev for about @xmath101 of the surviving samples ) , which is mainly due to the unitary requirement and the @xmath90 constraint .",
    "the second is that @xmath4 and @xmath35 can be as light as 58 gev because the lep2 bound is relaxed significantly due to the weakened @xmath53 and @xmath102 couplings by the seizable mixing angle @xmath103 and the open - up of the new decay mode @xmath104 .",
    "gev , the constraint from lep search for higgs bosons is still strong and in this case , the lower mass bound of @xmath4 is 86 gev @xcite . ]",
    "the third character is that the values of both @xmath44 and @xmath46 are close to the value of @xmath100 , which is helpful in reducing the l2hdm contribution to the precise electroweak data such as @xmath105 and @xmath106 couplings at z - pole . for @xmath107 gev ,",
    "the data require @xmath108 @xcite , and in this case , @xmath44 has little effects on the data so that it can deviate significantly from @xmath100 .    in summary ,",
    "the above results indicate that the preferred parameter space of the l2hdm is @xmath109 , @xmath110 gev and the other higgs bosons lighter than 250 gev .",
    "note that the above favored region is obtained by considering all the constraints ( 1 - 11 ) , instead of any individual constraint .",
    "for example , for @xmath111 , our results indicate that the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 as heavy as @xmath112 gev can still explain @xmath90 ; but such a large @xmath18 is disfavored by the @xmath113 coupling at @xmath33-pole or by @xmath87 leptonic decay .",
    "another point we should address is that in the l2hdm , the processes @xmath114 and @xmath115 can not impose any further constraints @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in the surviving parameter space , @xmath18 must be larger than 37 and , consequently , the couplings of bottom quark with @xmath116 and @xmath4 are suppressed , as shown in eq.([couplings ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that in contrast to the l2hdm which has a large parameter space to account for the @xmath90 discrepancy without conflicting with other experimental data , the popular type - ii 2hdm is very difficult to do so @xcite .",
    "this is one of the virtues of the l2hdm .",
    "eq.([couplings ] ) indicates that the lepton couplings of @xmath0 , @xmath35 and @xmath116 are enhanced by large @xmath18 , while quark couplings are suppressed .",
    "since the allowed parameter space has a large @xmath18 , the couplings of @xmath87 lepton with @xmath0 , @xmath35 and @xmath116 are larger than the top quark couplings .",
    "so these scalars will decay dominantly into @xmath87 leptons rather than into top quarks ( if kinetically allowed ) .",
    "moreover , a light @xmath0 can change the phenomenology of other higgs bosons by opening new decay modes like @xmath92 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "as discussed earlier , in case of a large @xmath18 and a small @xmath103 , @xmath4 is the sm - like higgs boson , mainly responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking and couples to weak gauge bosons like the sm higgs .",
    "therefore , the phenomenology of @xmath4 is of primary importance and will be studied in the following .",
    "fig.3 shows the branching ratio of @xmath119 versus @xmath44 .",
    "here we have considered all the decay modes of @xmath4 including @xmath120 .",
    "this figure shows that for most of the allowed parameter space ( about @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 is the dominant decay mode .",
    "this will make the detection of @xmath4 difficult at the lhc because the lightness of @xmath0 ( note @xmath123 gev for about @xmath98 surviving samples ) will make the @xmath87 leptons from its decay highly collimated @xcite , which is usually regarded as a difficult scenario in higgs discovery at the lhc in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model @xcite .",
    "another reason for the detection difficulty of @xmath4 is that for more than @xmath124 of the allowed parameter space , the width of @xmath4 is found to be larger than 10 gev .",
    "such a wide width will smear the peak of the invariant mass distribution of @xmath4-decay products and make the detection more difficult .",
    "we note that in the l2hdm , @xmath125 is the second largest decay mode of @xmath0 .",
    "so @xmath126 can give the multi - muon signal , like the scenario proposed in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the l2hdm the branching ratio of @xmath127 is of order @xmath128 , which will make the channel @xmath129 quite hopeless at the lhc .",
    "note that some authors have considered the channels @xmath130 @xcite and @xmath131 @xcite as well as the diffractive higgs production @xmath132 followed by @xmath133 @xcite to detect such a @xmath4 , but all these studies did not consider the worse case of a fat @xmath4 .",
    "we also checked that the branching ratio of @xmath134 is usually suppressed to be less than @xmath135 and thus too small for the detection .",
    "furthermore , we examine other complementary new channels for detecting the higgs sector of the l2hdm .",
    "firstly , we check the associated @xmath136 production at the lhc .",
    "the cross section of this process is shown in fig . 4 and one can learn that for @xmath137 gev the cross section is larger than 100 fb .",
    "the dominant decay of @xmath35 in this case is found to be @xmath138 , with a branching ratio larger than @xmath124 , so the main signal of this process is @xmath139 . due to the lightness of @xmath0 ,",
    "great efforts are needed to analyze the signal and the backgrounds in order to detect this process at the lhc .",
    "secondly , we note that @xmath0 is always lighter than @xmath33 boson in the allowed parameter space and thus it may be produced from @xmath33 decays .",
    "so we investigate the decay @xmath140 and find its branching ratio ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 for @xmath141 gev ( corresponding to @xmath142 of the allowed parameter space ) .",
    "such a large rate is within the sensitivity of the gigaz option at the proposed international linear collider @xcite .",
    "we examined various direct and indirect constraints on the lepton - specific two - higgs doublet model and then checked the property of the higgs bosons in the allowed parameter space .",
    "we found that the allowed space has a very light cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 ( @xmath1 gev with @xmath2 possibility ) which is composed dominantly by the leptonic higgs and decays dominantly into @xmath143 .",
    "the sm - like higgs boson @xmath4 decays dominantly in the mode @xmath11 , which may make the higgs discovery difficult at the lhc .",
    "we also checked other possibilities for testing the higgs sector of this model and found that the decay @xmath144 has a branching ratio ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath145 , which may be accessible at the the gigaz option of the ilc .",
