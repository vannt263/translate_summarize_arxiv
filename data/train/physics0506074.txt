    "since the explosion of the complex network science that has taken place after works of watts and strogatz @xcite as well as barabsi and albert @xcite a lot of real - world networks have been examined .",
    "the examples are technological networks ( internet , phone calls network ) , biological systems ( food webs , metabolic systems ) or social networks ( co - authorship , citation networks ) @xcite . despite this , at the beginning little attention",
    "has been paid to _ transportation networks _ - mediums as much important and also sharing as much complex structure as those previously listed . however , during the last few years several _ public transport systems _ ( pts ) have been investigated using various concepts of statistical physics of complex networks @xcite .",
    "chronogically the first works regarding transportation networks have dealt with power grids @xcite .",
    "one can argue that transformators and transmission lines have little in common with pts ( i.e. underground , buses and tramways ) , but they definitely share at least one common feature : embedding in a two - dimensional space . research done on the electrical grid in united states - for southern california @xcite and for the whole country @xcite as well as on the grtn italian power network @xcite revealed a single - scale degree distributions ( @xmath4 with @xmath5 ) , a small average connectivity values and relatively large average path lengths .",
    "all railway and underground systems appear to share well known small - world properties @xcite .",
    "moreover this kind of networks possesses several other characteristic features .",
    "in fact latora and marichiori have studied in details a network formed by the boston subway @xcite .",
    "they have calculated a network _",
    "efficiency _ defined as a mean value of inverse distances between network nodes . although the global efficiency is quite large @xmath6 the local efficiency calculated in the subgraphs of neighbors is low @xmath7 what indicates a large vulnerability of this network against accidental damages .",
    "however , the last parameter increases to @xmath8 if the subway network is extended by the existing bus routes network . taking into account geographical distances between different metro stations",
    "one can consider the network as a weighted graph and one is able to introduce a measure of a network cost .",
    "the estimated relative cost of the boston subway is around 0.2 % of the total cost of fully connected network .",
    "sen et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced a new topology describing the system as a set of train lines , not stops , and they have discovered a clear exponential degree distribution in indian railway network . this system has shown a small negative value of assortativity coefficient .",
    "seaton and hackett @xcite have compared real data from underground systems of boston ( first presented in @xcite ) and vienna with the prediction of bipartite graph theory ( here : graph of lines and graph of stops ) using generation function formalism .",
    "they have found a good correspondence regarding value of average degree , however other properties like clustering coefficient or network size have shown differences of 30 to 50 percent .    in works of amaral , barrat , guimer et al .",
    "@xcite a survey on the world - wide airport network has been presented .",
    "the authors have proposed truncated power - law cumulative degree distribution @xmath9 with the exponent @xmath10 and a model of preferential attachment where a new node ( flight ) is introduced with a probability given by a power - law or an exponential function of physical distance between connected nodes .",
    "however , only an introduction of geo - political constrains @xcite ( i.e. only large cities are allowed to establish international connections ) explained the behavior of betweenness as a function of node degree .    other works on airport networks in india @xcite and",
    "china @xcite have stressed small - world properties of those systems , characterized by small average path lengths ( @xmath11 ) and large clustering coefficients ( @xmath12 ) with comparison to random graph values .",
    "degree distributions have followed either a power - law ( india ) or a truncated power - law ( china ) . in both cases an evidence of strong disassortative degree - degree correlation has been discovered and it also appears that airport network of india has a hierarchical structure expressed by a power - law decay of clustering coefficient with an exponent equal to @xmath13 .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied a part of data for pts in @xmath14 polish cities and we have analyzed their nodes degrees , path lengths , clustering coefficients , assortativity and betweenness . despite large differences in sizes of considered networks ( number of nodes ranges from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) they share several universal features such as degree and path length distributions , logarithmic dependence of distances on nodes degrees or a power law decay of clustering coefficients for large nodes degrees .",
    "as far as we know , our results are the first comparative survey of several public transport systems in the same country using universal tools of complex networks .",
    "to analyze various properties of pts one should start with a definition of a proper network topology .",
    "the idea of the space l and p , proposed in a general form in @xcite and used also in @xcite is presented at fig .",
    "[ fig : przestrzenie ] .",
    "the first topology ( space l ) consists of nodes representing bus , tramway or underground stops and a link between two nodes exists if they are consecutive stops on the route .",
    "the node degree @xmath15 in this topology is just the number of directions ( it is usually twice the number of all pts routes ) one can take from a given node while the distance @xmath16 equals to the total number of stops on the path from one node to another .",
    "although nodes in the space p are the same as in the previous topology , here an edge between two nodes means that there is a direct bus , tramay or underground route that links them . in other words , if a route @xmath17 consists of nodes @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 , then in the space p the nearest neighbors of the node @xmath20 are @xmath21 .",
    "consequently the node degree @xmath15 in this topology is the total number of nodes reachable using a single route and the distance can be interpreted as a number of transfers ( plus one ) one has to take to get from one stop to another .",
    "another idea of mapping a structure embedded in two - dimensional space into another , dimensionless topology has recently been used by rosvall _",
    "_ in @xcite where a plan of the city roads has been mapped into an `` information city network '' . in the last topology a road represents a node and an intersection between roads - an edge , so the network shows information handling that has to be performed to get oriented in the city .",
    "we need to stress that the spaces l and p do not take into account euclidean distance between nodes .",
    "such an approach is similar to the one used for description of several other types of network systems : internet @xcite , power grids @xcite , railway @xcite or airport networks @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      taking into account the normalization condition @xmath22 we get the following equations for the average degree and the average square degree :    @xmath23    @xmath24    dropping all terms proportional to @xmath25 we receive simplified equations for @xmath26 i @xmath27 :    @xmath28    @xmath29 since values of @xmath30 range between @xmath31 and @xmath32 and they are independent from network sizes @xmath33 as well as observed exponents @xmath34 we have approximated @xmath30 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k12 ] ) - ( [ eq : k22 ] ) by an average value ( mean arithmetical value ) for considered networks , @xmath35 . at figs .",
    "[ fig : k ] and [ fig : k2 ] we present a comparison between the real data and values calculated directly form eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k12 ] ) and ( [ eq : k22 ] ) .",
    "plots presenting path length distributions @xmath36 in spaces l and p are shown at figs .",
    "[ fig : pll ] and [ fig : plp ] respectively . the data well fit to asymmetric , unimodal functions",
    "in fact for all systems a fitting by lavenberg - marquardt method has been made using the following trial function :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fitting coefficients .",
    "inserts at figs .",
    "[ fig : pll ] and [ fig : plp ] present a comparison between experimental results of @xmath40 and corresponding mean values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pll ] ) .",
    "one can observe a very good agreement between averages from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pll ] ) and experimental data .",
    "the agreement is not surprising in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : plp ] since the number of fitted data points to curve ( [ eq : pll ] ) is quite small , but it is more prominent for fig . [",
    "fig : pll ] .",
    "ranges of distances in the space l are much broader as compared to corresponding ranges in the space p what is a natural effect of topology differences .",
    "it follows that the average distance in the space p is much smaller ( @xmath41 ) than in the space l. the characteristic length 3 in the space p means that in order to travel between two different points one needs in average no more than two transfers .",
    "other pts also share this property , depending on the system size the following results have been obtained : @xmath42 ( mbta ) , @xmath43 ( vienna ) , @xmath44 ( irn ) . in the case of the space l the network mbta with its average shortest path length @xmath45 is placing itself among the values acquired for pts in poland .",
    "average path length in airport networks is very small : @xmath46 for anc , @xmath47 for ani and @xmath48 for wan .",
    "however , because flights are usually _ direct _",
    "( i.e. there are no stops between two cities ) one sees immediately that the idea of the space l does not apply to airport networks - they already have an intrinsic topology similar to the space p. average shortest path lengths @xmath40 in those systems should be relevant to values obtained for other networks after a transformation to the space p.    the shape of path length distribution can be explained in the following way : because transport networks tend to have an inhomogeneous structure , it is obvious that distances between nodes lying on the suburban routes are quite large and such a behavior gives the effect of observed long tails in the distribution . on the other hand shortest distances between stops not belonging to suburban routes are more random and they follow the gaussian distribution .",
    "a combined distribution has an asymmetric shape with a long tail for large paths .",
    "we need to stress that inter - node distances calculated in the space l are much smaller as compared to the number of network nodes ( see table i ) . simultaneously clustering coefficients @xmath49 are in the range @xmath50 .",
    "such a behavior is typical for small - world networks @xcite and the effect has been also observed in other transport networks @xcite .",
    "the small world property is even more visible in the space p where average distances are between @xmath51 and the clustering coefficient @xmath52 ranges from 0.682 to 0.847 which is similar to mbta ( @xmath53 ) , vienna ( @xmath54 ) or irn ( @xmath55 ) .      in @xcite",
    "an analytical estimation of average path length @xmath40 in random graphs has been found .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath40 can be expressed as a function of the degree distribution .",
    "in fact the mean value for shortest path length between @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be written as @xcite :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is euler constant .",
    "since pts are not random graphs and large degree - degree correlation in such networks exist we have assumed that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lij ] ) is only partially valid and we have written it a more general form @xcite :    @xmath61    to check the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lijmoj ] ) we have calculated values of average path length between @xmath62 as a function of their degree product @xmath56 for all systems in the space l .",
    "the results are shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : lij ] , which confirms the conjunction ( [ eq : lijmoj ] ) .",
    "a similar agreement has been received for the majority of investigated pts .",
    "( [ eq : lijmoj ] ) can be justified using a simple model of random graphs and a generating function formalism @xcite or a branching tree approach @xcite .",
    "in fact the scaling relation ( [ eq : lijmoj ] ) can be also observed for several other real world networks @xcite .",
    "it is useless to examine the relation ( [ eq : lijmoj ] ) in the space p because corresponding sets @xmath62 consist usually of 3 points only .",
    "we have studied clustering coefficients @xmath63 defined as a probability that two randomly chosen neighbors of node @xmath57 possess a common link .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network seems to depend weakly on parameters of the space l and of the space p. in the first case its behavior with regard to network size can be treated as fluctuations , when in the second one it is possible to observe a small decrease of @xmath64 along with the networks size ( see table [ tab : all ] ) .",
    "we shall discuss only properties of the clustering coefficients in the space p since the data in the space l are meaningless .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that clustering coefficient in irn in the space p decays linearly with the logarithm of degree for large @xmath15 and is almost constant ( and close to unity ) for small @xmath15 . in the considered pts",
    "we have found that this dependency can be described by a power law ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ckmiasta ] ) :    @xmath65    such a behavior has been observed in many real systems with hierarchical structures @xcite . in fact , one can expect that pts should consist of densely connected modules linked by longer paths .",
    "observed values of exponents @xmath66 are in the range @xmath67 .",
    "this can be explained using a simple example of a _ star _ network : suppose that the city transport network is a star consisting of @xmath68 routes with @xmath69 stops each .",
    "node @xmath57 , at which all @xmath68 routes cross is a vertex that has the highest degree in the network .",
    "we do not allow any other crossings among those @xmath68 routes in the whole system .",
    "it follows that the degree of node @xmath57 is @xmath70 and the total number of links among the nearest neighbors of @xmath57 is @xmath71 . in other words",
    "the value of the clustering coefficient for the node with the maximum degree is :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 .",
    "it is obvious that the minimal degree in the network is @xmath74 and this correspondences to the value @xmath75 . using these two points and assuming that we have a power - law behavior we can express @xmath66 as :    @xmath76    because @xmath77 and @xmath78 we have @xmath79 .    in real systems",
    "the value of clustering coefficient of the highest degree node is larger than in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmax ] ) due to multiple crossings of routes in the whole network what leads to a decrease of the exponent @xmath66 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ckmiasta ] ) .",
    "this decrease is also connected to the presence of degree - degree correlations ( see the next section ) .",
    "to analyze degree - degree correlations in pts we have used the assortativity coefficient @xmath80 , proposed by newman @xcite that corresponds to the pearson correlation coefficient @xcite of the nodes degrees at the end - points of link :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 - number of pairs of nodes ( twice the number of edges ) , @xmath83 - degrees of vertices at both ends of @xmath57-th pair and index @xmath57 goes over all pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "values of the assortativity coefficient @xmath80 in the space l are independent of the network size and are always positive ( see table [ tab : all ] ) , what can be explained in the following way : there is a little number of nodes characterized by high values of degrees @xmath15 and they are usually linked among themselves .",
    "the majority of remaining links connect nodes of degree @xmath84 or @xmath85 , because @xmath84 is an overwhelming degree in networks .",
    "similar calculations performed for the space p lead to completely different results ( fig . [ fig : rp ] ) . for small networks",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath80 is negative and it grows with @xmath33 , becoming positive for @xmath86 . the dependence can be explained as follows : small towns are described by star structures and there are only a few _ doubled routes _",
    ", so in this space a lot of links between vertices of small and large @xmath15 exist . using the previous example of a star network and taking into account that the degree of the central node is equal to @xmath87 ,",
    "the degree of any other node is @xmath88 , after some algebra we receive the following expression for the assortativity coefficient of such a star network :    @xmath89    let us notice that the coefficient @xmath80 is independent from the number of crossing routes and is always a negative number .    on the contrary , in the large cities",
    "there are lots of connections between nodes characterized by large @xmath15 ( transport hubs ) as well as there is a large number of routes crossing in more than one point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) .",
    "it follows that the coefficient @xmath80 can be positive for such networks .",
    "a strange behavior for the largest network ( gop ) can be explained as an effect of its peculiar structure : the system is rather a conglomerate of many towns than a single city .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath80 is lowered by single links between the subsets of this network .    at fig .",
    "[ fig : betar ] we show coefficients @xmath66 as a function of @xmath80 in the space p. one can see that in general positive values of the assortativity coefficient correspond to lower values of @xmath66 , being an effect of existence of several links between hubs in the networks .",
    "reported values of assortativity coefficients in other transport networks have been negative ( @xmath90 for ani @xcite and @xmath91 for irn @xcite ) and since these systems are of the size @xmath92 thus it is in agreement with our results .",
    "the last property of pts examined in this work is betweenness @xcite which is the quantity describing the `` importance '' of a specific node according to equation @xcite :    @xmath93    where , @xmath94 is a number of the shortest paths between nodes @xmath58 and @xmath15 , while @xmath95 is a number of these paths that go through the node @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig : bkl ] shows dependence of the average betweenness @xmath96 on node degree calculated using the algorithm proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "data at fig .",
    "[ fig : bkl ] fit well to the scaling relation :    @xmath97    observed in internet autonomous systems @xcite , co - authorship networks @xcite and ba model or erds - rnyi random graphs @xcite .    the coefficient @xmath98 is plotted at fig . [ fig : eta ] as a function of network size .",
    "one can see , that @xmath98 is getting closer to 2 for large networks .",
    "since it has been shown that there is @xmath99 for random graphs @xcite with poisson degree distribution thus it can suggest that large pts are more random than small ones .",
    "such an interpretation can be also received from the table [ tab : pk ] where larger values of the exponent @xmath100 are observed for large cities .",
    "the betweenness as a function of node degree @xmath15 in the space p is shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : bkp ] .",
    "one can see large differences between fig .",
    "[ fig : bkl ] and [ fig : bkp ] . in the space p",
    "there is a saturation of @xmath96 for small @xmath15 what is a result of existence of the suburban routes while the scale - free behavior occurs only for larger @xmath15 .",
    "the saturation value observed in the limit of small @xmath15 is given by @xmath101 and the length of the saturation line increases with the mean value of a single route s length observed in a city .",
    "in this study we have collected and analyzed data for public transport networks in 22 cities that make over 25 % of population in poland .",
    "sizes of these networks range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . using the concept of different network topologies",
    "we show that in the space l , where distances are measured in numbers of passed bus / tramway stops , the degree distributions are approximately given by a power laws with @xmath102 while in the space p , where distances are measured in numbers of transfers , the degree distribution is exponential with characteristic exponents @xmath103 .",
    "distributions of paths in both topologies are approximately given by a function @xmath104 .",
    "small world behavior is observed in both topologies but it is much more pronounced in space p where the hierarchical structure of network is also deduced from the behavior of @xmath105 .",
    "the assortativity coefficient measured in the space l remains positive for the whole range of @xmath33 while in the space p it changes from negative values for small networks to positive values for large systems . in the space l distances between two stops are linear functions of the logarithm of their degree products .",
    "many of our results are similar to features observed in other works regarding transportation networks : underground , railway or airline systems @xcite .",
    "all such networks tend to share small - world properties and show strong degree - degree correlations that reveal complex nature of those structures .",
