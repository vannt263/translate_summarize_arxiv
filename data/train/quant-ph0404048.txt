    "with the development of optical lattice technology @xcite , considerable attention has been focused on the experimental simulation of a variety of many - particle systems , such as spin chains @xcite .",
    "this provides the possibility to probe and realise complex quantum models with unique properties in the laboratory .",
    "such examples , that are of interest in various areas of physics , are the systems that include many - body interactions .",
    "the latter have been hard to study in the past due to the difficulty in controlling them externally and isolating them from the environment @xcite . to overcome these problems , techniques",
    "have been developed in quantum optics @xcite which minimise imperfections and impurities in the implementation of the desired structures , thus paving the way for the consideration of such `` higher order '' phenomena of multi - particle interactions .",
    "their applications could be of much interest to cold atom technology as well as to condensed matter physics and quantum information .    in this paper",
    "we obtain the interaction terms of bosonic or fermionic lattices of two species of atoms , denoted here by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these can be two different hyperfine ground states of the same atom coupled via an excited state by a raman transition .",
    "the system is brought initially into the mott insulator phase where the number of atoms at each site of the lattice is well defined . by restricting to the case of only one atom per site",
    "it is possible to characterise the system by pseudo - spin basis states provided by internal ground states of the atom .",
    "interactions between atoms in different sites are facilitated by virtual transitions .",
    "these are dictated by the tunneling coupling @xmath3 from one site to its neighbours and by collisional couplings @xmath4 that take place when two or more atoms are within the same site .    in the following",
    "we consider the case of weak tunneling couplings , @xmath5 , assuring that we are always in the mott insulator regime .",
    "our aim is to construct a perturbative study of the effective interactions with respect to the small parameter @xmath6 . up to the third order this expansion will provide hamiltonians that include three - spin interactions .",
    "these multi - particle interactions can be , in principle , realised with the near future technology .",
    "the main physical requirement is large collisional couplings , @xmath4 , which can be obtained experimentally by feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "first theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite advances are already promising .",
    "hence , the time interval needed for those higher order terms to have a significant effect can be well within the coherence times of the system .",
    "several applications spring out from our studies .",
    "the systematic description of the low energy hamiltonian provides the means for the advanced control of the three - spin interactions simulated in the lattice .",
    "hence , different physical models can be realised , with ground states that present a rich structure such as multiple degeneracies and a variety of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "some of these multi - spin interactions have been theoretically studied in the past in the context of the hard rod boson @xcite , using self - duality symmetries @xcite .",
    "phase transitions between the corresponding ground states have been analysed @xcite .",
    "subsequently , these phases may also be viewed as possible phases of the initial system , that is in the mott insulator , where the behaviour of its ground state can be controlled at will @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ lattice ] , we present the physical system and the conditions required to obtain three - body interactions .",
    "the effective three - spin hamiltonians for the case of bosonic or fermionic species of atoms in a system of three sites on a lattice are given in sec .",
    "[ eff ] . in sec .",
    "[ raman ] we study the effect raman transitions can have on the tunneling process and generalised effective hamiltonians are presented that do not preserve the number of atoms of each species .",
    "these are of particular interest for the construction of certain geometrical evolutions . in sec . [ complex ]",
    "complex tunnelings are considered and the generation of chiral ground states is presented . in sec .",
    "[ onedim ] our results are extended toward the construction of one dimensional models and several applications are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we present an outlook and the conclusions .",
    "finally , in the appendix , two alternative methods are presented for the perturbation theory that results in the three - spin interactions .",
    "let us consider a cloud of ultra cold neutral atoms superimposed with several optical lattices @xcite . for sufficiently strong intensities of the laser field",
    "this system can be placed in the mott insulator phase where the expectation value of only one particle per lattice site is energetically allowed @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the particular setup of lattices that form an equilateral triangular configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] .",
    "this allows for the simultaneous superposition of the positional wave functions of the atoms belonging to the three sites . as we shall see in the following this results in the generation of three - spin interaction .",
    "the main contributions to the dynamics of the atoms in the lattice sites are given by the collisions of the atoms within the same site and the tunneling transitions of the atoms between neighbouring sites .",
    "in particular , the coupling of the collisional interaction for atoms in the same site are taken to be very large in magnitude , while they are supposed to vanish when they are in different sites .",
    "due to the low temperature of the system , this term is completely characterised by the s - wave scattering length . furthermore",
    ", the overlap of the wannier wave functions between adjacent sites determines the tunneling amplitude , @xmath3 , of the atoms from one site to its neighbours . here",
    ", the relative rate between the tunneling and the collisional interaction term is supposed to be very small , i.e. @xmath5 , so that the state of the system is mainly dominated by the collisional interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the three lattice sites with three atoms of species @xmath7 subject to the above interactions is given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the annihilation operator of atoms of species @xmath11 at site @xmath12 .",
    "the annihilation operator can describe fermions or bosons satisfying commutation or anticommutation relations respectively given by @xmath13_{\\pm}=\\delta_{jj ' } \\delta_{\\sigma \\sigma ' } , \\\\ & [ a_{j\\sigma},a_{j'\\sigma'}]_{\\pm}=[a_{j\\sigma}^\\dagger , a_{j'\\sigma'}^\\dagger]_{\\pm}=0 , \\end{split } \\label{comm}\\ ] ] where the @xmath14 sign denotes the anticommutator or the commutator .",
    "the operator @xmath15 is the corresponding number operator and @xmath16 denotes normal ordering of the product of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 is the lowest order in the expansion with respect to the tunneling interaction .    due to the large collisional couplings activated when two or more atoms are present within the same site ,",
    "the weak tunneling transitions do not change the average number of atoms per site .",
    "this is achieved by adiabatic elimination of higher population states along the evolution leading eventually to an effective hamiltonian ( see appendix ) .",
    "the latter allows virtual transitions between these levels providing eventually non - trivial evolutions . as we shall see in the appendix it is possible to describe the low energy evolution of the bosonic or fermionic system up to the third order in the tunneling interaction by the effective hamiltonian @xmath18 the indices @xmath19",
    ", @xmath20 refer to states with one atom per site while @xmath21 , @xmath22 refer to states with two or more atomic populations per site , @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of the collisional part , @xmath17 , while we neglected fast rotating terms effective for long time intervals .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the energy scales involved in such a physical system .",
    "we would like to have a significant effect of the three - spin interaction within the decoherence times of the experimental system , which we can take here to be of the order of several 10 ms .",
    "it is possible to vary the tunneling interactions from zero to some maximum value which we can take here to be of the order of @xmath241 khz @xcite . in order to have a significant effect from the term @xmath25 produced within the decoherence time one should choose @xmath2610 khz",
    "this can be achieved experimentally by moving close to a feshbach resonance @xcite , where @xmath4 can take significantly large values as long as trap losses , attributed to three body collisions or production of molecules , remain negligible . with respect to these parameters we have @xmath27 , which is within the mott insulator regime , while the next order in perturbation theory is an order of magnitude smaller than the one considered here and hence negligible .",
    "note however , that new interaction terms arise only in @xmath28 order in perturbation due to the triangular geometry of the optical lattice .",
    "this places the requirements of our proposal for detecting the effect of three - spin interactions within the range of the possible experimental values of the near future technology .    within the regime of single atom occupancy per site it is possible to switch to the pseudo - spin basis of states of the site @xmath12 given by @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "restrict to a large degree the form of the low energy expansion .",
    "for example , the conservation of the atom number of each species corresponds , in the spin basis , to the conservation of the total @xmath31-spin .",
    "hence , any rotation on the @xmath32-spin plane leaves the hamiltonian invariant .",
    "this fact limits the possible spin operators that can contribute to the effective low energy interactions .",
    "possible terms of the effective hamiltonian are given by @xmath33 for the one - body interaction , @xmath34 for the two body interaction or @xmath35 for the three - body interactions where @xmath36 , ( see fig . [ triangle ] ) .",
    "as we can easily verify , the three - spin operators break parity symmetry , which is explicitly given by the transformation @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that their coupling coefficient should also be asymmetric with respect to this transformation , as the original atomic system possesses this symmetry .",
    "indeed , in the next section we shall see how these terms are generated in the optical lattice setup .",
    "another important insight for the ground states of the presented hamiltonians comes from the geometry of the lattice . in the case",
    "considered here , the triangular pattern allows for the generation of exotic ground states due to frustration , that is ground states that are not minimising the energy of the individual hamiltonians of each link of the triangle .",
    "this effectively allows for the presence of multiple degeneracy in the ground state of the system as we shall see in particular examples .",
    "consider the low energy evolution of the triangular system given in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] of three atoms in three sites of the lattice without the application of any external field .",
    "different rates in the tunneling parameter can then be achieved by tuning the intensities of the laser field corresponding to the different directions of the triangle . by applying the perturbative expansion ( [ effective ] ) up to the third order",
    "we obtain that the system can effectively be described by @xmath38 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the @xmath19 pauli matrix with the usual commutation properties @xmath40=2i \\epsilon^{\\nu \\mu \\omega } \\delta_{jk } \\sigma_{j}^{\\omega}$ ] .",
    "the three - spin interactions presented in the last line can be viewed as the two spin interactions of the second line controlled by the third spin ( being spin up or down ) through an additional @xmath41 operator .",
    "the couplings , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , are given as expansions in @xmath45 by @xmath46 @xmath47 where the symbol @xmath48 denotes the repeating of the same term as on its left , but with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 indices interchanged .",
    "the @xmath42 term contributes to an overall phase factor in the time evolution of the system and can be ignored .",
    "the @xmath43 term can easily be eliminated and an arbitrary magnetic field term of the form @xmath49 can be added by applying a raman transition with the appropriate laser fields .",
    "the behaviour of the effective couplings as functions of the tunneling and collisional couplings is given in fig .",
    "[ comb1 ] .",
    "one can isolate different parts of hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) , each one including a three - spin interaction term , by varying the tunneling and/or the collisional couplings appropriately so that particular terms in ( [ ham1 ] ) vanish , while others are freely varied .",
    "an example of this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ zzz ] where the couplings @xmath50 and @xmath51 are depicted . there , for the special choice of the collisional terms , @xmath52",
    ", the @xmath50 coupling is kept to zero for a wide range of the tunneling couplings , while the three - spin coupling , @xmath51 , can take any arbitrary value .",
    "one can also suppress the exchange interactions by keeping one of the two tunneling couplings zero without affecting the freedom in obtaining arbitrary positive or negative values for @xmath51 as seen in fig .",
    "[ zzz ] .    hence , the one dimensional hamiltonian of the form @xmath53 can be simulated in the optical lattice where all of its couplings can be arbitrarily and independently varied",
    ". the three - spin interaction term of this hamiltonian possesses fourfold degeneracy in its ground state , spanned by the states @xmath54 .",
    "the criticality behaviour of this model has been extensively studied in the past @xcite , where it is shown to present first and second order phase transitions . in particular , for @xmath55 its self dual character can be demonstrated @xcite . to explicitly show that let us define the dual operators @xmath56 that also satisfy the usual pauli spin algebra .",
    "we can re - express the hamiltonian @xmath57 with respect to the dual operators obtaining finally @xmath58 this equation of self duality indicates that if there is one critical point then it should be at @xmath59 as has also been verified numerically .",
    "furthermore , the two spin interactions @xmath60 has a degeneracy with a @xmath61 symmetry while @xmath62 has a three fold degeneracy leading to a @xmath63 symmetry . by varying the corresponding couplings of the effective hamiltonian it is possible to induce transitions to and from the @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath63 ordered phases in a similar fashion as has been theoretically demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the case of fermionic atoms and derive the effective interactions they induce up to the third order .",
    "compared to the couplings in the bosonic case we now have @xmath65 being the only one that is present .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle can be signalled by having @xmath66 that eventually forbids two fermionic atoms of the same species from occupying the same site . keeping terms up to the third order in @xmath67 and employing the anticommutation relations ( [ comm ] ) we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath68 , \\end{split } \\nonumber\\ ] ] where the effective couplings are a function of the initial variables of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) and @xmath69 the dependence of the coupling terms on the parameters of the initial hamiltonian is simpler than in the bosonic case .",
    "nevertheless , they can express a similar behaviour as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ comb2 ] .",
    "if the tunneling constants do not depend on the pseudo - spin orientation then any three - spin interaction vanishes",
    ". nevertheless , when the tunneling amplitudes depend on the spin and by having just one of the orientation with non - zero tunneling , then just the diagonal two- and three - spin interactions remain .",
    "a number of variations of the previous hamiltonians are possible by employing techniques available from quantum optics @xcite .",
    "an interesting example involves the application of raman transitions during the tunneling process .",
    "these transitions involve the direct coupling of the two atomic states @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". consequently they are not atom - number preserving for each of the species .",
    "let us first consider the case where the atoms are strongly trapped by an optical lattice as in the previous sections . if the lasers producing the raman transition are forming standing waves it is possible to activate tunneling transitions of atoms that simultaneously experience a change in their internal state .",
    "as we shall see in the following the resulting hamiltonian is given by an @xmath70 rotation applied to each pauli matrix of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we shall consider the case of activating the tunneling with the application of two individual raman transitions .",
    "these transitions consist of four paired laser beams @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , each pair having a blue detuning @xmath75 and @xmath76 , different for the two different transitions . the phases and amplitudes of the laser beams",
    "can be properly tuned so that the first raman transition allows the tunneling of the state @xmath77 with tunneling rate @xmath78 between two neighbouring sites , while the second one activates the tunneling of the state @xmath79 by an additional phase difference of @xmath80 between the lasers @xmath73 , @xmath74 , with an effective tunneling rate @xmath81 . in the above equations @xmath82 denotes the phase difference between the @xmath83 laser field , while @xmath84 , where @xmath85 are their corresponding rabi frequencies .",
    "hence , the effective tunneling term is given by @xmath86 where the tunneling couplings @xmath87 and @xmath81 are given by the potential barrier of the initial optical lattice superposed by the potential reduction due to the raman transitions in addition , the creation and annihilation operators are given as an @xmath70 rotation of the initial ones , i.e. @xmath88 with the unitary @xmath70 matrix @xmath89 hence , the resulting tunneling hamiltonian can be obtained from the initial one via an @xmath70 rotation @xmath90 , where the corresponding tunneling couplings are formally identified , i.e. @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that the collisional hamiltonian is not affected by the raman transitions , and hence it is not transformed under @xmath93 rotations .",
    "it is easy to derive the effective hamiltonian for this transformation using the perturbative expansion .",
    "indeed , from expressions ( [ second ] ) and ( [ third ] ) of the appendix we straightforwardly obtain the second and third order terms of the hamiltonian @xmath94 that appear after the application of the raman transition .",
    "they are given by an @xmath70 rotation that acts on the pauli matrices of the initial effective hamiltonian .",
    "actually this statement holds in all orders of the perturbation theory and reads in its generality @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the order of the perturbation .",
    "note that this useful result holds not only for the @xmath82 rotations , but also for the @xmath97 rotations which , in general , do not commute with the collisional hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "we now show that the above presented raman transitions can be employed to obtain , for example , the anisotropic xy model .",
    "the direction of anisotropy is determined by the phase difference of the laser fields employed for the raman transition .",
    "in particular consider , as in the previous , three sites of the optical lattice in a equilateral triangular configuration .",
    "for simplicity we assume @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian to the third order becomes the rotation @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a @xmath31-axis rotation and @xmath102 is the @xmath103 rotated effective hamiltonian around the @xmath104-axis given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 @xmath107 these effective couplings agree with the ones presented in ( [ effcouplings ] ) .",
    "moreover , by controlling the amplitude of the initial standing waves that trap the atoms in their equilibrium positions it is possible to reactivate the tunnelings @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this has the effect that the overall hamiltonian is the sum of the two hamiltonians , the rotated one ( [ rotated ] ) and the initial one ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "one can now check that the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is invariant under @xmath110 rotations . on the other hand , when we add the hamiltonians @xmath111 and the one from ( [ ham1 ] ) we obtain the generalised version of the anisotropic @xmath112 model where additional third order terms are present .",
    "hence , by turning on the @xmath108 and @xmath109 tunnelings we can obtain the rotated version of the anisotropic @xmath112 model , where the rotation is performed with respect to the @xmath31-spin axis by an angle @xmath82 .",
    "this approach provides a variety of control parameters ( e.g. the angle @xmath82 and the ratio of the couplings of the two added hamiltonians ) and , in addition , one can have these variables independent for each of the three directions of the two dimensional optical lattice .",
    "particular settings of these structures have been proved to generate topological phenomena @xcite , that support exotic anyonic excitations , useful for the construction of topological memories @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of varying arbitrarily the control parameters of the above hamiltonians and , consequently , of their ground states gives us the natural setup to study such phenomena as geometrical phases in lattice systems .",
    "examples will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "consider the case where we employ complex tunneling couplings @xcite in the transitions described above .",
    "this can be performed by employing additional characteristics of the atoms like a charge @xmath113 , an electric moment @xmath114 or a magnetic moment @xmath115 , and external electromagnetic fields . as the external fields can break time reversal symmetry , new terms of the form @xmath116 appear in the effective hamiltonian . in particular , the minimal coupling of the atom with the external field can be given in general by substituting its momentum by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the electric field and @xmath119 is the vector potential .",
    "all of these terms satisfy the gauss gauge if we demand that @xmath120 and @xmath121 , hence they can generate a possible phase factor for the tunneling couplings .    the first term results in the well known aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , while the second one is the origin of the aharonov - casher effect @xcite .",
    "the first one requires that the atoms involved are charged , which is not possible to achieve in the optical lattice setup . on the other hand",
    "it is plausible to consider the electric or magnetic moments of the atoms .",
    "nevertheless the aharonov - casher effect requires that the magnetic moment of the atom moves in the field of a straight homogeneously charged line , the latter being technologically difficult to implement .",
    "though , resent experiments have been performed that generalise the aharonov - casher effect partly overcoming the technological obstacles @xcite .",
    "the third case involves the cyclic move of an electric moment through a gradient of a magnetic field finally contributing the phase @xmath122 to the initial state , where @xmath123 is the surface enclosed by the cyclic path of the electric moment .",
    "for example , if @xmath114 is perpendicular to the surface @xmath123 , taken to lie on the @xmath124-@xmath104 plane then a non - zero phase , @xmath82 , is produced if there is a non - vanishing gradient of the magnetic field along the @xmath31 direction .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath114 is along the surface plane , then a non - zero phase is produced if the @xmath31 component of the magnetic field has a non - vanishing gradient along the direction of @xmath114 . hence , it is possible to generate a phase factor contribution to the tunneling couplings @xmath125 with @xmath126 here @xmath127 and @xmath128 denote the positions of the lattice sites connected by the tunneling coupling @xmath3 .    in order to isolate the new terms that appear in the case of complex tunneling couplings we should restrict to purely imaginary ones , i.e. @xmath129 . then the effective hamiltonian ( [ effective ] ) becomes @xmath130 , \\end{split } \\label{complexboson}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 with @xmath132 denotes the total antisymmetric tensor in three dimensions and summation over the indices @xmath133 is implied .",
    "the couplings appearing in ( [ complexboson ] ) are given in the bosonic case by @xmath134 and in the fermionic case by @xmath135 by taking @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , one can set , in the bosonic case , with the aid of feshbach resonances and compensating zeeman terms , all the couplings to be zero apart from @xmath140 .",
    "hence , the effective hamiltonian reduces to @xmath141 with @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "remarkably , with this physical proposal , the interaction term ( [ chiral ] ) can be isolated , especially from the zeeman terms that are predominant in equivalent solid state implementations .",
    "this interaction term is also known in the literature as the _ chirality operator _ @xcite .",
    "it breaks time reversal symmetry of the system , a consequence of the externally applied field , by effectively splitting the degeneracy of the ground state into two orthogonal sectors , namely `` @xmath144 '' and `` @xmath145 '' , related by time reversal , @xmath146 .",
    "these sectors are uniquely described by the eigenstates of @xmath147 at the sites of one triangle .",
    "the lowest energy sector with eigenenergy @xmath148 is given by @xmath149 the excited sector , @xmath150 , represents counter propagation with eigenvalue @xmath151 and it is obtained from ( [ states ] ) by complex conjugation @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first physical proposal where this interaction term can be isolated , especially from the zeeman terms that are predominant in equivalent solid state implementations .",
    "alternative models employing cold atom technology for the generation of topologically non - trivial ground states are given in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to employ the three - spin interactions that we studied extensively in the previous sections for the construction of extended one and two dimensional systems .",
    "the two dimensional generalisation is rather straightforward as the triangular system we considered is already defined on the plane .",
    "hence , all the interactions considered so far can be generalised for the case of a two dimensional lattice where the summation runs through all the lattice sites with each site having six neighbours .",
    "the construction of the one dimensional model is more involving .",
    "in particular , we now consider a whole chain of triangles in a zig - zag one dimensional pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ chain ] . in principle",
    "this configuration can extend our model from the triangle to a chain .",
    "nevertheless , a careful consideration of the two spin interactions shows that terms of the form @xmath152 appear in the effective hamiltonian , due to the triangular setting ( see fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) . such hamiltonian terms involving nearest and next - to - nearest neighbour interactions are of interest in their own right @xcite but will not be address here .",
    "it is also possible to introduce a longitudinal optical lattice with half of the initial wavelength , and an appropriate amplitude such that it cancels exactly those interactions generating , finally , chains with only neighbouring couplings .    in a similar fashion",
    "it is possible to avoid generation of terms of the form @xmath153 by deactivating the longitudinal tunneling coupling in one of the modes , e.g. the @xmath1 mode , which deactivates the corresponding exchange interaction .",
    "as we are particularly interested in three - spin interactions we would like to isolate the chain term @xmath154 from the @xmath155 term of hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "this term includes , in addition , all the possible triangular permutations . to achieve that we could deactivate the non - longitudinal tunneling for one of the two modes , e.g. the one that traps the @xmath1 atoms .",
    "the interaction @xmath156 is homogeneous , hence it does not pose such problem when it is extended to the one dimensional ladder . with the above procedures we can finally obtain a chain hamiltonian as in ( [ ham1 ] ) where the summation runs up to the total number @xmath157 of the sites .",
    "in this paper we presented a variety of different spin interactions that can be generated by a system of ultra - cold atoms superposed by optical lattices and initiated in the mott insulator phase .",
    "in particular , we have been interested in the simulation and study of various three - spin interactions conveniently obtained in a lattice with equilateral triangular structure .",
    "they appear by a perturbation expansion to the third order with respect to the tunneling transitions of the atoms when the dominant interaction is the collisions of atoms within the same site . among the models presented here we specifically considered the @xmath156 interaction , a third order generalisation of the rotated inhomogeneous @xmath112 model , as well as interactions that explicitly break chiral symmetry .",
    "these models can exhibit degeneracy in their ground states and undergo a variety of quantum phase transitions that can also be viewed as phases of the initial mott insulator .",
    "it is possible to employ quantum simulation techniques @xcite , in a similar fashion as for two spin hamiltonians , to generate effective three - spin interactions that are not possible to obtain straightforwardly from the optical lattice system .",
    "hence , a variety of additional hamiltonians can be obtained by considering manipulations of the above three - spin interactions with the application of appropriate instantaneous one or two spin transformations .",
    "the possibility to externally control most of the parameters of the effective hamiltonians at will reenters our model as a unique laboratory to study the relationship among exotic systems such as chiral spin systems , fractional quantum hall systems or systems that exhibit high-@xmath158 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "in addition , suitable applications have been presented within the realm of quantum computation @xcite where three - qubit gates can be straightforwardly generated from the three - spin interactions .",
    "furthermore , unique properties related with the criticality behaviour of the chain with three - spin interactions has been analysed in @xcite where the two - point correlations , used traditionally to describe the criticality of a chain , seem to fail to identify long quantum correlations , suitably expressed by particular entanglement measures @xcite .    in conclusion , we have presented a physical model that can efficiently simulate a variety of three - spin interactions .",
    "the employed optical lattice techniques give the possibility to externally manipulate and control the couplings of the interactions .",
    "the effect of these terms will eventually be significant with the improvement of the experimental techniques .",
    "importantly , the three - spin interactions can be isolated from two - spin ones or from possible zeeman terms that are always present in the corresponding spin systems .",
    "this makes the further study of their properties an important task for future work .",
    "we thank derek lee for inspiring conversations and almut beige , alastair kay and martin plenio for critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by a royal society university research fellowship and by the spanish grant mecd ap2001 - 1676 .",
    "thanks the qi group at damtp for their hospitality , where part of this work was done .",
    "consider the case of two species of atoms trapped in optical potentials forming a triangular configuration subject to the hamiltonian given by ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "for simplicity define the diagonal free hamiltonian to be given by @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is either zero or proportional to @xmath161 , @xmath162 or @xmath163 .",
    "as we have already mentioned we consider the case where tunneling couplings are much smaller than the collisional ones @xmath164 .",
    "then the evolution of the system is dominated by the term @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , when we start from a configuration of one atom per lattice site , denoted by the subspace @xmath165 of configurations , and activate small tunneling couplings , the change of atom number per site would be energetically unfavourable and is hence adiabatically eliminated .    to see this",
    "analytically we employ the interaction picture with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath17 obtaining @xmath166.\\ ] ] the evolution operator in the interaction picture is given by the time ordered formula @xmath167 { \\nonumber\\\\}{\\nonumber\\\\}&&=\\mathbb{i } - { { \\rm i } \\over \\hbar } \\int _ 0^t h_i ( t')dt ' - { 1 \\over \\hbar^2 } \\int_0^t dt ' \\int_0^{t ' } dt''h_i(t')h_i(t '' ) { \\nonumber\\\\}{\\nonumber\\\\}&&+ { { \\rm i } \\over \\hbar ^3 } \\int_0^t dt ' \\int_0^{t ' } dt '' \\int_0^{t '' } dt'''h_i(t ' ) h_i(t '' ) h_i(t ' '' ) { \\nonumber\\\\}{\\nonumber\\\\}&&+ { \\cal o}((jt)^4 ) .",
    "\\label{evol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] higher orders are negligible as long as times @xmath168 are considered for which @xmath169 remains sufficiently small , while @xmath170 is large enough to avoid the accumulation of population outside the subspace @xmath165 .",
    "the latter condition is necessary to exempt fast rotating phase factors appearing when performing the above time integrals .",
    "these phase factors are of the form @xmath171 and @xmath172 which is zero for @xmath173 .",
    "these conditions are in agreement with the previous demands that @xmath169 is very small while @xmath170 is relatively large .",
    "hence , we can directly calculate each term of the expansion ( [ evol ] ) without having to take into account fast rotating terms .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath147 that corresponds to this evolution can be obtained by the term proportional to time @xmath168 in the expansion of the evolution operator , i.e. @xmath174 consider now the second term on the right hand side of ( [ evol ] ) .",
    "this term gives no evolution within the subspace @xmath165 of states as the tunneling hamiltonian term @xmath175 moves you necessarily out of the @xmath165 configurations .",
    "the third term gives ( see @xcite ) @xmath176 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicate states in @xmath165 , @xmath21 indicates states out of @xmath165 and @xmath177 are the eigenstates of @xmath17 , where we have used @xmath178 .",
    "this gives the usual second order effective hamiltonian presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "consider now three sites and the effect of the third term in eqn .",
    "( [ evol ] ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the effective hamiltonian with matrix elements @xmath179    with the formulae ( [ second ] ) and ( [ third ] ) one can perform the perturbation up to the third order and find the desired three - spin interactions ( [ effective ] ) . in practise",
    "the evaluation of the terms that contribute to the three - spin hamiltonian is quite simple .",
    "the states corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath180 include sites with two or three atoms of the same or of different species .",
    "hence , @xmath181 .",
    "next you need to consider the different evolutions of the form @xmath182 , that populations undertake .",
    "the tunneling couplings @xmath183 are determined by each of these transitions and an appropriate coefficient is obtained in the case of the bosonic generation or annihilation of two atoms of the same species in one site .",
    "as an alternative procedure it is possible to eliminate the fast oscillating term without performing the perturbative expansion .",
    "this elimination is related with the adiabatic elimination of the states with two or more atoms per lattice site that are separated from the states with one atom per lattice site ( configurations in @xmath165 ) by a large energy gap proportional to @xmath184 .",
    "in fact if we set a decomposition of the three site in terms of basis states of the form @xmath185 where @xmath186 denote the site , and @xmath187 and @xmath188 denote the number of atoms of species @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively in site @xmath189 we can write the general state of the three sites as @xmath190 by employing the schrdinger equation we can obtain the time - differential equations of the coefficients @xmath191 of the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 with indexes @xmath194 corresponding to states that do not belong to @xmath165 include fast rotating phases and , hence , they are zero , i.e. for those states @xmath195 .",
    "this provides a set of linear equations of the form @xmath196 that can be solved , in principle , explicitly . in our case ,",
    "( [ schr ] ) has overall 56 equations resulting from the schrdinger equation with 48 reduced to a linear system of coupled algebraic equations .",
    "this set can be solved by a computer and then expanded in terms of small couplings @xmath5 obtaining an alternative verification of the previous perturbative expansion ."
