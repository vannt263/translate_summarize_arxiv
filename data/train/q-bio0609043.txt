    "<S> importantly , this gtp hydrolysis is the only step in the process of nuclear import that requires input of metabolic energy . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the energy obtained from rangtp hydrolysis is used to create a concentration gradient of karyopherin - cargo complexes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus , and the process of actual translocation across the npc occurs purely by diffusion ( reviewed in @xcite ) .    conceptually , nuclear import can be divided into three stages : first , the loading of cargo onto karyopherins in the cytoplasm ; then , the translocation of karyopherin - cargo complexes through the npc ( cf . fig . </S>",

    "<S> a theory of npc - mediated transport has to answer several major questions : _ i _ ) the transport of any macromolecules , even those potentially able to negotiate the npc unaided , is increased by their specific association with npcs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how does the npc achieve high transport efficiency of the cargoes of variable sizes and in both directions , through only passive diffusion of the transport factor - cargo complexes ? _ </S>",
    "<S> ii ) _ how does binding of transport factors to fg - nups facilitate transport efficiency while maintaining a high throughput ( up to hundreds of molecules per second per npc ) @xcite ? _ </S>",
    "<S> iii ) _ npcs largely exclude non - specific macromolecules in favor of transport factor - bound cargoes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . how is this high degree of selectivity achieved ? _ </S>",
    "<S> iv ) _ neither deletion of up to half of the mass of the fg - nups , nor deletion of asymmetrically disposed fg - nups that potentially set up an affinity gradient , abolish transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> directionality of transport across the npc can even be reversed by reversing the concentration difference of the rangtp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how can we account for such a high degree of robustness ?    </S>",
    "<S> the model we present here provides answers to these questions , explaining the functional features of the npc in terms of its known structural and physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we show how karyopherin binding to the flexible filaments inside the npc gives rise to efficient transport . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the competition for the limited space and binding sites within the npc leads to highly selective filtering . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how the flexibility of the fg - nups accounts for the high robustness of npc - mediated transport with respect to structural changes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by summarizing the salient features of nuclear transport , and discuss verifiable experimental predictions of the model .      </S>",
    "<S> the npc is a protein assembly spanning the nuclear envelope that contains a central channel , about 35 nm in diameter , connecting the nucleoplasm with the cytoplasm . </S>",
    "<S> the internal volume of this channel , as well as large fractions of the nuclear and cytoplasmic surfaces of the npc , are occupied by unstructured polypeptide chains collectively known as fg - nups because they carry unusually high numbers of repeats containing phenylalanine - glycine pairs . </S>",
    "<S> fg - nups are known to be flexible @xcite . since the fg - nups also protrude into the nucleus and the cytoplasm , the effective length of the nuclear pore complex </S>",
    "<S> is estimated to be  70 nm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the distribution of the fg - nups inside the central channel and the external surfaces of the npc , as well as the exact number of binding sites on the fg - nups and on the karyopherins , are not fully known . </S>",
    "<S> we shall therefore make no specific assumptions about the distribution of fg - nups , interactions between them , and their density , degree of flexibility or conformation within the npc .    </S>",
    "<S> we represent the transport through the npc as a combination of two independent processes contributing to the movement of the karyopherin - cargo complexes through the central channel of the npc : _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ the binding and unbinding of the karyopherins to the fg - nups , and textit(ii ) the spatial diffusion of the complexes , either in the unbound state , or while still bound to a flexible fg - nup@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complexes entering the npc from the cytoplasm stochastically hop back and forth inside the channel until they either reach the nuclear side , where the cargo is released by rangtp , or return to the cytoplasm . </S>",
    "<S> detachment from the fg - nups and exit from the npc can be either thermally activated , or catalyzed by rangtp directly at the nuclear exit of the npc @xcite . a schematic illustration of transport through the npc </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . 1 .      </S>",
    "<S> it is important to distinguish between two different properties of the transport process : the _ speed _ and the _ probability _ with which individual complexes that enter from the cytoplasm traverse the npc to nuclear side . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we show below , binding of karyopherins to the fg - nups increases their transport efficiency , i.e. , the probability of them traversing the npc ; in the absence of such binding , the probability of traversing the npc is low .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we shall assume that the unbinding and rebinding occur faster than lateral diffusion of karyopherin - cargo complexes along the channel(our conclusions nevertheless were verified by computer simulations for any ratio of binding - unbinding rate to diffusion rate ) . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , the hopping between discrete binding sites can be approximated by diffusion in an effective potential which combines two effects : entropic repulsion of the fg - nups , as the large cargoes have to compress and displace them to enter the channel , and attraction due to binding to the binding sites in the fg - nups @xcite ; this approximation is justified below . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we represent the transport of karyopherin - cargo complexes through the npc as a one - dimensional diffusion in a potential @xmath4 ( expressed in units of @xmath5 ) , in the interval @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . we solve the model for an arbitrary shape of the potential , determined by the distribution of the binding sites on the fg - nups along the channel . </S>",
    "<S> we do not directly model the diffusion of complexes outside of the npc . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we assume that karyopherin - cargo complexes stochastically enter the npc from the cytoplasm , with an average rate @xmath7 at @xmath8 ; @xmath7 is proportional to the concentration of the karyopherin - cargo complexes in the cytoplasm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the release of karyopherin - cargo complexes from fg - nups by rangtp at the nuclear exit is modeled by imposing an exit flux @xmath9 at @xmath10 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the length of the npc corresponds to the interval from @xmath8 to @xmath10 ; the regions of length @xmath11 ( of the order of the width of the channel @xcite ) at both ends of the interval correspond to the distance outside the npc over which the particles diffuse away by three - dimensional diffusion into either the nucleoplasm or the cytoplasm . </S>",
    "<S> we use absorbing boundary conditions at @xmath12 and @xmath13 that correspond to a karyopherin - cargo complex returning back to the cytoplasm , or going through to the nucleus , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the difference in the diffusion coefficient of the complexes inside and outside the npc in order to focus on the role of karyopherin binding in the import process . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that no current enters from the nucleus , as the cargoes are released from the karyopherins in the nucleus by rangtp . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we neglect the variations of the potential in the direction perpendicular to the channel axis . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of these factors will be studied in detail elsewhere . under the above assumptions , transport of the karyopherin - cargo complexes through the npc </S>",
    "<S> is described by the diffusion equation for the density of the complexes inside the channel , @xmath14 @xcite : @xmath15 where the local current @xmath16 is given by : @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient .    </S>",
    "<S> the entrance current @xmath19 splits into @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , corresponding to the flux of complexes returning to the cytoplasm and going through to the nucleus , respectively . at a position @xmath22 , the transmitted flux </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 splits into @xmath9 and @xmath23 , which correspond to the karyopherin - cargo complexes released from the fg - nups by rangtp and to thermally activated release , respectively ( cf . fig . </S>",

    "<S> eq.([ptr_ran ] ) is the main result of this section and has several important consequences . </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath37 defines the transport efficiency , which is seen to increase with the potential depth @xmath38 , ( defined as @xmath39 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , proportional to the binding strength of the karyopherins to the fg - nups . in the absence of binding </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath34 is small ( @xmath40 ) , so that a complex will on average return to the cytoplasm soon after entering the npc . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive potential inside the npc _ increases _ the time the complex spends inside the npc and thus _ increases _ the probability that it reaches the nuclear side , rather than returns to the cytoplasm .    when rangtp only releases cargo from its karyopherin , but not from the fg - nups ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , the maximal translocation probability @xmath34 is 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case when rangtp also releases karyopherin - cargo complexes from fg - nups , the translocation probability @xmath34 can reach 1 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the latter effect is more pronounced for large @xmath42 , that is for strong binding at the exit .    the second important consequence of eq . ( [ ptr_ran ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is that the translocation probability @xmath34 depends only weakly on the _ shape _ of the potential @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we predict that the transport properties of the npc are relatively insensitive to details of the distribution of fg - nups inside the npc , and to the distribution of the binding sites on fg - nups .      </S>",
    "<S> the discussion of the previous section neglects the mutual interactions between karyopherin - cargo complexes . </S>",
    "<S> however , a large interaction strength @xmath38 increases transport efficiency at the expense of an increased transport time @xmath43 ( which grows roughly exponentially with @xmath38 @xcite ) , leading to accumulation of particles inside the channel . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for high @xmath38 , interactions between the complexes due to steric occlusion and decrease in the available binding sites become important .    </S>",
    "<S> to quantitatively investigate how mutual interference between translocating karyopherin - cargo complexes affects transport efficiency , we performed dynamic monte carlo simulations of the diffusion of complexes inside the npc , in the potential @xmath44 , using a variant of the gillespie algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are a discrete version of the continuum formulation of the previous section . </S>",
    "<S> the interval @xmath45 $ ] is represented by @xmath46 discrete `` sites '' ; these sites do not represent the actual binding sites , but correspond to the length of a diffusion step . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we allow only one particle at each site at any moment of time , which models mutual occlusion between complexes ; however , our results pertain for any allowed occupancy . in line with our analytical model above , karyopherin - cargo complexes are deposited at the site @xmath47 , if it is unoccupied , with a probability @xmath48 per simulation step . </S>",
    "<S> when a complex reaches site @xmath49 ( cytoplasm ) or @xmath50 ( nucleus ) , it is removed . </S>",
    "<S> the complexes present at site @xmath51 can be removed directly , with the probability @xmath52 , which models the effect of the release of the complexes from fg - nups by nuclear rangtp . </S>",
    "<S> once inside the channel , a complex present at site @xmath53 can hop to an adjacent unoccupied site @xmath54 with the following probability : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the site occupancy : @xmath57 if the site is unoccupied , and @xmath58 if a particle is present at the site ; @xmath59 is the transition rate from site @xmath53 to @xmath60@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our simulations are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . for low interaction strength @xmath38 the translocation probability curves for all entrance fluxes @xmath19 collapse onto a single line which is predicted by the analytical solution of the previous section , because in this regime there are few complexes simultaneously present in the channel , and the interactions between them are negligible . for stronger binding , </S>",
    "<S> karyopherin - cargo complexes accumulate inside the channel , blocking the inflow of additional complexes .    </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion of the simulations , as shown in fig.3 * a * , is that the transport through the npc is maximal for an optimal value of the interaction strength @xmath61 , which depends on the entrance rate @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in npc throughput at high @xmath62 becomes significant when the number of karyopherin - cargo complexes in the channel reaches a certain critical value , @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this critical occupancy of the channel @xmath63 is proportional both to the entrance flux @xmath7 , and to the residence time @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and therefore the optimal interaction strength is higher for low entrance fluxes as illustrated in panel * b * of fig </S>",
    "<S> . 3 [ fig_trans_prob_ran ] .    </S>",
    "<S> existence of an optimal interaction strength provides a mechanism for the selectivity of npc - mediated transport . </S>",
    "<S> the translocation probability is high for a particular strength of interaction of karyopherins with fg - nups , while macromolecules that do not interact with fg - nups are filtered out .      </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the previous section , the binding of karyopherins to fg - nups provides a mechanism of selectivity , because transport of the karyopherin - cargo complexes is highest for a specific value of their interaction strength with the fg - nups . </S>",
    "<S> however , the maximum depicted in fig . 3**a * * is broad ; the translocation probability is significant even for binding strengths considerably lower than the optimal one . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the optimal interaction strength is @xmath66 , macromolecules whose interaction strength is @xmath67 a have probability of reaching the nucleus that is just a half of the optimal one . </S>",
    "<S> this broad maximum allows npc - mediated import to function efficiently across a broad range of transport factor binding strengths . on the other hand , this might also permit passage of macromolecules that bind non - specifically to fg - nups ( e.g. , due to electrostatic interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , proper functioning of living cells requires a high selectivity of the npc - how might this be achieved ?    </S>",
    "<S> so far , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 only takes into account the competition between complexes of identical binding strength for space inside the channel . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a situation where optimally - binding karyopherins compete for space and binding sites inside the channel with weakly - binding macromolecules , the passage of the latter is sharply reduced which sharply increases the selectivity of the npc . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , because the residence time is higher for strongly - binding karyopherins , a weakly - binding macromolecule upon entering the channel will with high probability find it blocked by a karyopherin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the low affinity macromolecule will with high probability return to the cytoplasm due to a relatively low residence time . on the other hand , if a karyopherin enters a channel that is already occupied by another karyopherin , there is a high probability that it will reside inside the channel long enough for the first karyopherin to get through . as free karyopherins exchange back and forth across the npc constantly , there will always be karyopherins ( or other transport factors ) binding in the npc and so excluding non - specific macromolecules , making the npc a remarkably efficient filter .    </S>",
    "<S> these heuristic arguments were verified via computer simulation . </S>",
    "<S> two species of particles of different binding affinities ( representing the karyopherins and another macromolecule that can non - specifically bind to the fg - nups ) , are deposited stochastically at the npc entrance with the same average rate @xmath7 . as in the previous section , the particles diffuse inside the channel until they either reach the nucleus , or return to the cytoplasm ; a site can be occupied by only one particle .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the simulations are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , which compares the transport efficiency of strongly binding macromolecules to that of weakly binding ones in the case when they compete for the space inside the npc . </S>",
    "<S> the competition for the space inside the channel between the translocating particles dramatically narrows the selectivity curve as compared with fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . this effect is a novel mechanism for the enhancement of transport selectivity beyond what is expected from the binding affinity differences alone . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other mechanisms of specificity ( e.g. kinetic proofreading@xcite ) , no additional metabolic energy is required for this enhanced discrimination . instead , selectivity is achieved by competition producing a differential npc response to two ranges of binding affinities . in the range of higher binding affinities occupied by transport factors , </S>",
    "<S> passage across the npc is efficient ; whereas in the low range of affinities , transmission is effectively prevented .      in the previous sections , </S>",
    "<S> we have used a continuous potential to model transport through the npc . however , in reality the translocating karyopherin - cargo complexes hop between discrete binding sites that are located on the flexible fg - nups , which fluctuate in space around their anchor point due to thermal motion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows complexes to diffuse along the channel while remaining bound to an fg - nup . </S>",
    "<S> a complex can also unbind from an fg - nup and rebind again to the same or a neighboring fg - nup , moving while unbound by passive diffusion . in this section , </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate how the _ number _ of fg - nups inside the channel affects transport .    </S>",
    "<S> the translocation of the karyopherin - cargo complexes through the npccan be described as a diffusion in an array of potentials , as illustrated in fig . 5 , where each potential well @xmath68 represents an fg - nup . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of each well depends on the binding strength of the karyopherin - cargo complex and the rigidity and the length of an fg - nup , which determine the cost of its entropic stretching in the process of spatial diffusion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the blue line corresponds to the unbound state . </S>",
    "<S> although for the purposes of illustration all the wells are shown to have the same form , the subsequent results are valid for arbitrary distribution of potential shapes . </S>",
    "<S> we shall denote the density of the karyopherin - cargo complexes in the @xmath53-th well as @xmath69 and the density of unbound complexes as @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the lateral diffusion of the complexes , combined with the binding and unbinding to the fg - nups is then described by the following equations @xcite :    @xmath71\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\rho_i(x)}{\\partial t}&=&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}e^{-u_i(x)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}e^{u_i(x)}\\rho_i(x)+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & r_{0i}(x)\\rho_{0i}-r_{i0}(x)\\rho_i(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the local unbinding and binding rates , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are related by the detailed balance condition : @xmath74 . if the unbinding rates are fast compared to the diffusion time across the wells ( i.e. @xmath75 ) , the relative densities of bound and unbound complexes are at their local equilibrium boltzmann ratio @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total density of the complexes at a position @xmath78 . summing up the equations ( [ eq_crossing_wells ] ) , one obtains an equation for the total complex density @xmath33 :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the process of translocation through the npc can be described as simple lateral diffusion in the effective potential @xmath81 , which leads to the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ smoluchowski1],[smoluchowski2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown in previous sections , the transport properties of the npc are relatively insensitive to the detailed shape of the effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we predict that the transport trough the nuclear pore is robust with respect to the variations in the number of the fg - nups , as indeed observed experimentally @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> even more strikingly , the transport properties of the npc are not sensitive to the number of the fg - nups also in the case when the fg - nups are distributed sparsely inside the npc , without a significant overlap . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this issue through a marginal case where the fluctuation regions of each fg - nup barely touch , represented by the potential shown by the black line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6**a**. the flat central part of each potential well corresponds to the diffusion of the karyopherin - cargo complex while bound to an fg - nup , and the sharply rising regions at the borders correspond to unbinding of the complex and its transfer to the next filament . </S>",
    "<S> narrow wells correspond to relatively rigid filaments , while wide wells correspond to flexible filaments that can stretch to a long distance without significant entropic cost . </S>",
    "<S> the potential wells can have different widths @xmath82 so that @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> all the potential wells have the same shape , @xmath84 , re - scaled to the width of an individual well , so that the potential at a point @xmath85 is : @xmath86 .    crucially , the transport properties of the potential shown in fig . 6**a * * _ do not depend on the number of wells_. both the translocation probability and the residence time are equivalent for the multi - well potential shown in black , and the single well potential shown in red , obtained by re - scaling an individual black well to the whole length @xmath87 of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ptr_ran ] ) that the translocation probability for the multi - well potential with @xmath88 wells , is @xmath89 which is independent of the number and the width of the wells because @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we prove in the supporting information that the residence time is similarly independent of the number of wells . </S>",
    "<S> since both translocation probability and residence time are independent of the number of wells , the transport properties do not depend on the number of wells even for high entrance rate or binding strength , when jamming is important , as verified by computer simulation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6**b * * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result highlights the robustness of our model of npc transport ; in multiwell potentials of this type , the npc s transport properties do not depend on the specific number of fg - nups , so long as they are flexible enough for their fluctuation regions to overlap , permitting complexes to freely transfer from one filament to the next .      </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a physical model of transport through the npc . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of diffusion in a channel and binding to flexible filaments accounts for the major observed features of npc transport , without the need for further detailed assumptions such as the conformation and distribution of fg - nups inside the channel or the shape of the channel itself .    </S>",
    "<S> a crucial component of our model is the interaction between karyopherins and fg - nups , which provides a mechanism for both efficiency and selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the absence of binding , the probability of crossing the npc is much lower than the probability of returning to the cytoplasm . </S>",
    "<S> the binding of karyopherins to fg - nups increases the residence time of the karyopherin - cargo complexes within the npc , preventing their premature return to the cytoplasm , and hence increasing their chance of diffusing to the nucleus , i.e. , increasing the efficiency of their transport .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the selectivity of the npc arises from a balance between the _ probability _ and the _ speed _ of transport of individual karyopherin - cargo complexes . </S>",
    "<S> similar ideas have been suggested to account for the transport properties of ion channels and porins@xcite . in our model , the probability of a karyopherin - cargo complex reaching the nucleus increases with the binding strength to fg - nups , but at the expense of increasing residence time inside the npc ; eventually , complexes spend so much time in the npc that they impede the passage of other complexes through channel . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is an optimal value of the binding strength of karyopherins to fg - nups that maximizes their transport efficiency through the npc . </S>",
    "<S> this optimal binding strength is higher for low entrance fluxes @xmath7 , because at low fluxes the accumulating complexes can reside longer in the channel without blocking it ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . this observation could account for the proliferation of different karyopherins types ; the binding strength of each karyopherin type might be related to the total relative abundance of its cargoes . </S>",
    "<S> our model applies to both export and import processes , and explains how highly efficient nucleocytoplasmic transport can be achieved in both directions by pure diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> for proper cell functioning , the npc should selectively transport karyopherin - cargo complexes , effectively filtering out any macromolecules that do not bind specifically to the fg - nups . </S>",
    "<S> however , the basis for discrimination between specifically and non - specifically binding macromolecules may be as little as a few @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel mechanism that further enhances the specificity of npc transport . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism relies on the direct competition between karyopherins and non - specifically binding macromolecules ; they compete for space and binding sites in the channel . as a consequence of their stronger binding , </S>",
    "<S> karyopherins have a longer residence time within the channel as compared with non - specifically binding macromolecules which are therefore out - competed for space and binding sites within the channel . </S>",
    "<S> the constant flux of cargo bound- or free karyopherins between the nucleus and cytoplasm therefore effectively excludes non - specifically binding macromolecules from the channel . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , although no metabolic energy is expended in this filtering process@xcite , the resulting selectivity is much higher that might be expected from only the binding affinities differences between specific and non - specific macromolecules ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that transport efficiency is enhanced when rangtp directly releases karyopherins from their binding sites on fg - nups@xcite at the npc exit - an enhancement that increases with the binding strength at the nuclear exit . </S>",
    "<S> physically , high affinity binding sites at the nuclear exit of the npc decrease the probability of return , once a complex has reached the nuclear side . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction may account for the observed high affinity binding sites that are localized at the nuclear side on the npc in import pathways and cytoplasmic side in export pathways ( reviewed in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the transport properties of the npc depend strongly on the magnitude of the interaction strength , we predict that transport depends only weakly on spatial variations of the binding sites along the channel . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the _ number _ of flexible fg - nups inside the npc does not significantly affect transport , as long as their fluctuation regions can overlap ( figs . 5 and 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction could account for recent experiments in which up to half the total mass of fg - nup flexible regions in npcs were deleted without seriously hampering nucleocytoplasmic transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we predict that a gradient of binding affinity across the npc does not , by itself , increase the throughput compared to a uniform distribution of the same sites , explaining how transport can even be reversed across the npcby reversing the gradient of rangtp @xcite . only in combination with a high affinity trap at the exit , and high ran activity in releasing the karyopherins from this trap @xcite can the affinity gradient improve the throughput through the npc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> direct tests for our model s predictions can now be made by experimentally varying the effective potential experienced by the karyopherin - cargo complexes inside the npc , by systematically introducing mutations into the binding sites@xcite , changing the cargo size@xcite , or using cells with genetically modified numbers of the fg - nups@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , any device built according to the principles outlined above would possess the transport properties described by our model , suggesting strategies for creation of artificial nano - molecular sieves .      </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were written in c language and run on a cluster of unix processors . </S>",
