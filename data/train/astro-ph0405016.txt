    "chemical inhomogeneities in globular cluster ( gc ) stars are giving crucial clues on the formation and evolution of this most ancient stellar population .",
    "self enrichment mechanisms are being examined as ones of the possible  and most plausible  causes of abundance spread in many gcs .",
    "+ the question of self  enrichment in gcs was raised for the first time in connection with the wide spread in metallicity observed in @xmath1cen @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a large amount of work on this problem ( f.e . , smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , an aspect of which is the ability of a cluster to retain the matter lost by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . @xcite",
    "observe that @xmath1cen is not special among gcs in this respect , and that a few dozen other clusters should be capable of doing so .",
    "in fact , contrary to a substantial uniformity of abundance of heavy elements ( apart from the quoted @xmath1cen ) , light elements that are susceptible to abundance changes from proton - capture reactions , such as the pp , cn , on , nena , and mgal cycles , exhibit star - to - star abundance variations in many gcs , far in excess of the modest variations seen in halo field stars see , e.g. , @xcite , kraft ( 1994 ) , and sneden ( 1999,2000 ) . in recent years ,",
    "observations of these abundance spreads at the turnoff and among the subgiant stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that these anomalies must be attributed indeed to some process of self  enrichment occurring at the first stages of the life of the cluster , starting as soon as all the supernovae have already exploded ( expelling from the clusters their high velocity ejecta ) and the massive agb stars begin to evolve . at an epoch starting @xmath2yr from the birth of the first stellar generation , the massive agbs lose mass through low velocity winds , so that it can be reasonably speculated that these winds remain inside the cluster .",
    "+ the massive agb envelopes are the ideal place to manifacture elements through nuclear reactions in which proton captures are involved , as they are subject to hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although a quantitative reproduction of the observed abundance spreads , e.g. , of the oxygen vs. sodium anticorrelation @xcite , is still far from being available . one important feature of this hypothesis is that the chemistry of the stars which are formed in the second generation is not _ random _ , but reflects the continuous variation of hbb conditions with the decrease of the progenitor evolving mass , until the star formation process ends ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "thus the ejecta of these stars can be the source of the star - to - star abundance variations .",
    "+ the hypothesis that the ejecta are accreted on the already formed stars @xcite has been recently falsified by several observations see , for a summary of these problems , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we further explore the hypothesis that such ejecta continuously form second generation stars for a time lasting about 200myr @xcite .",
    "+ we argue that ngc 2808 is one of the clusters able to retain the agb ejecta , even if to a degree lower than @xmath1cen , which is capable of retaining at least part of snii ejecta ( f.e . ,",
    "smith et al .",
    "large variations in na abundance have been observed among the stars of this cluster @xcite , at all luminosity levels along the red giant ( rg ) branch .",
    "so members of this cluster have suffered pollution by na  enriched matter , as observed in m13 , m5 , m4 , m92 , m15 , ngc 6752 .",
    "we do not have information on main sequence abundances , as in ngc 6752 @xcite where a primordial origin for chemical inhomogeneities appears the only possible explanation , nevertheless the hypothesis of self enrichment in ngc 2808 is supported by the observed na spread .",
    "we expect the most massive and concentrated clusters to be in the best conditions to retain mass lost by cluster members .",
    "ngc 2808 has a central density of log ( @xmath3 ) = 4.9 ( /pc@xmath4 , pryor & meylan 1993 ) , among the largest densities found in galactic gcs ; the total visual magnitude is  =  9.26 @xcite , which , assuming a ratio @xmath5/l@xmath6 = 3 , gives a total cluster mass well above @xmath7 .",
    "according to gnedin et al .",
    "( 2002 , fig .",
    "2 ) , ngc 2808 would be at present quite able of retaining stellar winds of about 15 km s@xmath8 , the characteristic terminal velocity of agb winds ( loup et al .",
    "1993 ) . since according to @xcite",
    "the destruction time for this cluster is about 6 hubble times , present conditions should be close to those at formation epoch .",
    "+ the hypothesis that gc stars were formed in two different star formation events was intended to explain the presence of long blue tails in the hbs @xcite in gcs with large abundance spread @xcite .",
    "we have shown that blue tails can be the result of the evolution of main sequence stars with larger than average ( cosmological ) helium abundance .",
    "these latter stars have a mass smaller than average at the giant tip at present age and , for similar mass loss along the rg branch , will have a smaller mass ( and bluer location ) on the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "helium enrichment is a natural outcome of the agb evolution @xcite , together with other chemical anomalies which can help to explain the observed abundance spreads .",
    "we leave aside the question of whether the winds from intermediate mass stars ( ims ) can collect in the cluster central region , and here give origin to a new stellar generation , and concentrate on two other important issues :    1 .",
    "we have to specify which initial mass function ( imf ) is needed to give origin to enough stars in this second formation phase ; 2 .",
    "we have to explore more in detail which hb morphologies may derive from this process .",
    "in particular , the second star formation process may end when the helium content in the last ejecta ( which give birth to stars ) is still larger than the primordial helium content .",
    "this will produce _ a gap in the helium content _ , between the original population of low mass stars , and the last born low mass stars .",
    "does such a gap produce visible consequences in the distribution of stars in the hr diagram ?",
    "in this paper we attack these two problems , by extending the approach by @xcite to a cluster having not only a blue hb with a long blue tail , but also a red hb .",
    "we will examine the case of the cluster ngc 2808 , whose hb stellar distribution shows a well populated red clump , an extended blue hb , but it contains only two rr lyr stars .",
    "this cluster has been studied intensively in recent years . the only way to reproduce the hb distribution is apparently to invoke a bimodal ( or possibly multimodal ) mass distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "differences in age or metal content among cluster members should be of a size not supported by observations .",
    "bedin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) make an accurate study of the reddening , differential reddening and metallicity spread in the cluster , and conclude that the @xmath9 on [ fe / h ] is 0.03 on the carretta & gratton scale ( 1997 ) and 0.05 on the zinn & west scale ( 1984 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "their cm diagram and the one by walker ( 1999 ) leave little doubt on the matter . as for an age difference , it should be of about 24 gyr as required by the jump in colour ( and so in mass , about 0.04  at the cluster metallicity ) across the empty rr lyrae region : an occurrence which appears rather unlikely .",
    "besides , as noted by rosenberg , recio- blanco & garcia - marin ( 2004 ) , ngc 2808 is coeval with clusters of similar metallicity but much shorter hbs such as ngc 362 , ngc 1261 , ngc 1851 .",
    "similarly , not very much of definitive can be said on the role of rotation on hb distribution . after the many recent investigations on the matter , sweigart ( 2002 ) concludes that : ",
    "the impact of mixing and rotation on the hb remains to be clearly established \" .",
    "therefore we think important to explore new models for this complex cluster .",
    "+ we here explore the possibility that the dichotomy in the hb is due to the differing helium contents of the clump stars and blue hb stars .",
    "this assumption is certainly parametric and has no pretence of uniqueness , but it has three attractive features : i ) we know from the rg branch that the cluster stars show a dispersion in the abundances linked to the hot cno cycle ; ii ) if we accept that the massive agb stars are responsible for this abundance dispersion , all agb models predict that the agb winds are helium enriched ; iii ) the epoch of star formation from the agb winds must necessarily end when massive agbs are still evolving , and this will naturally produce a helium content gap .",
    "+ it is important to stress how the large amount of information on the chemical composition of the members of gcs has changed profoundly our perception of these stellar systems . the impossibility of a simple solution for their formation and evolution - one star generation , a common age , one common composition - obliges to look for more complex solutions , which have to consider the detailed history of star formation , element production and dynamical evolution , and their interactions .",
    "while we can make reasonable guesses on element production , we lack any real knowledge of the dynamical history of gcs .",
    "so in this investigation we relied on a possible chemical history of ngc 2808 , with only conjectures on dynamical processes .",
    "the hb in the cm diagram of ngc 2808 is composed by two regions clearly separated : a clump of red stars , similar to those observed in 47 tuc , m69 and m71 , and a long branch starting from the blue side of the rr lyr gap and reaching below the cluster turnoff . in the middle , two rr lyr variables ( one of type a , b and one of type c ) .",
    "the ( almost ) absence of rr lyr stars is in itself a surprise , but other clusters present similar hb distribution , as discussed , for example , by @xcite . as mentioned before , they find that the hb morphology of ngc 2808 can not be reproduced with a unimodal mass distribution , not even with a large mass dispersion , contrary to the cases of , e.g. , ngc 1851 and ngc 6229 .",
    "the main difficulty derives from the large amount of blue hb stars : according to @xcite , there are 580 blue hb members and 565 red ones .",
    "the hr diagram from this work is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where the red clump stars and the stars in the three different parts of the blue hb ebt1 , ebt2 and ebt3 , according to @xcite . in terms of mass loss along the rg branch",
    "this fact would imply a strongly bimodal behaviour of the mass loss phenomenon , with no apparent reason .",
    "+ the blue hb appears as a sort of `` different population '' , which we can try to interpret in terms of self  enrichment and multiple stellar generations in gcs . on the basis of the models in sect 3 for z=0.001 , the first star generation with y = 0.24 and age @xmath10 13 gyr reaches the rg tip with a mass of about 0.82  ( in absence of mass loss )",
    "the red hb clump appears centered at bmv   @xmath10 0.60 ( as shown in fig .  1 , taken from @xcite , assuming e(b v)=0.18 ) , which corresponds to a hb mass of 0.680.71 .",
    "so the implied mass loss is of about 0.13 . on the other hand ,",
    "a stellar population with y = 0.28 and age 13 gyr has at the rg tip a mass of @xmath10 0.77 , while for y = 0.32 the rg tip mass is @xmath10 0.72 . with the same amount of mass loss , a mixture of these two populations would populate the region on the blue side of the rr lyr gap , reaching  about 1.5 mag . if we assume as mass loss law either reimers formulation , or any other formulation currently employed ( e.g. lee , demarque & zinn 1994 , catelan 2000 ) , the mass loss rate increases with decreasing evolving mass .",
    "the giants with y = 0.28 and y = 0.32 would lose about 0.034  and 0.068  more , respectively .",
    "this would allow to reach , for the case y = 0.32 ,  @xmath10 3.6 : of course these are order - of - magnitude estimates , that show the potentiality of the assumptions , which will be further explored with numerical simulations .",
    "we complemented the models of z=0.001 computed in paper i for y=0.24 and y=0.28 with models with y=0.32 .",
    "we also evolved red giants with y=0.32 up to the helium flash in order to find the appropriate helium core mass for the hb models . in figure [ f2 ]",
    "we show the evolutionary tracks of 0.82   ( y=0.24 ) , 0.77  ( y=0.28 ) and 0.72(y=0.32 ) which evolve to the helium flash in approximately 13gyr .",
    "we can see that the color difference at the turnoff is negligible .",
    "a color difference of less than 0.04 mag ( corresponding to @xmath10100k ) is found in the subgiant branches , while the rg branches seem to converge in color .",
    "this simple comparison shows that we do not expect to easily recognize a helium spread as large as 0.08 for clusters of this metallicity , especially if there is a dominant population with about half of the stars having y=0.24 , while the other half are distributed in helium content , as we will show in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "of course a helium variation can be more easily recognized in two cases :    * if in a cluster there are at least two homogeneous consistent fractions of stars with different helium abundance , the main sequences and the subgiants may show a bifurcation in colors",
    ". this might be the case shown by @xcite for the main sequence of @xmath1  cen , although the peculiarities shown by this  cluster \" ( multiple turnoffs and subgiant branches ) depict a much more complex situation indeed ; * if the dominant population has a high helium content ( this could be the case , e.g. , for the clusters having a fully blue hb , namely those like m13 showing a clear  second parameter \" effect ) , it could be recognized by its smaller @xmath11  between the turnoff and the rg branch : e.g. a gc having normal helium would have @xmath12mag larger than a gc having y=0.32 and the same age .",
    "we mention tentatively that the different morphology of the hr diagram of m3 and m13 , which has been attributed to the younger age of m3 @xcite , could be due to the fact that m13 stars have a higher helium abundance .",
    "we postpone to another paper the discussion of the turnoff and main sequence luminosity and mass function in the presence of a helium spread , which requires a more detailed analysis , and may also lead to revise the mass function of low mass stars in gcs having a helium spread .",
    "+ we further computed models for the evolution up to the rg branch tip and on the hb for a total heavy element content of  = 0.002 and helium abundances  of 0.24 and 0.30 .",
    "evolutionary values for the helium core at the giant branch tip and for the helium increase in the envelope ( first  dredge up ) have been estimated for an age of 13 @xmath13 yr .",
    "+ the code used is aton2.0 @xcite , and the transformation from the theoretical plane are from @xcite .",
    "the hb models have been evolved until the disappearance of helium in the convective core .",
    "considering these models together with the models presented in @xcite , the mass at the helium tip as function of helium and metal content can be approximated by : @xmath14\\times \\log t    \\nonumber \\\\      -1.693(y-0.24)+2.768 + 12(z-10^{-3 } ) \\label{eq1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] estimates of the heavy element content z of ngc 2808 are between 0.001 and 0.002 ( walker 1999 , bedin et al .",
    "2000 , carretta et al .",
    "we compared the hr diagram of the rgs and hb of ngc 2808 from @xcite with our sets of models for z=0.001 and z=0.002 .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure [ f3 ] for z=0.001 : the red clump , the rg branch and the blue hb are well reproduced by the tracks .",
    "we adopt e(b  v)=0.18 ( walker 1999 , bedin et al .  2000 ) and",
    "( m - m)@xmath15=15.25 . on the contrary , the same comparison made for z=0.002 does not reproduce at the same time",
    "the location of the blue hb and of the rg branch , since the red giant tracks are redder by @xmath100.08mag than the observed branch , once fixed the location of the blue hb .",
    "this latter depends very weakly on the metallicity and on the helium content , and is independent from the treatment of convection . the red giant branch and clump locations , on the contrary ,",
    "depend on the convection model .",
    "we choose the models with z=0.001 on the basis of the better overall fit of the hr diagram , consistent both with the observed values of metallicity and with the estimated reddening .",
    "we examined also the case z=0.002 ; the modeling of the hb dichotomy follows the same pattern , except that the red clump requires a fine tuning of the mass loss . in any case , the results for the shape of the imf turn out to be substantially confirmed . + for the hb , we computed masses down to @xmath100.48 , which extend to @xmath16k .",
    "these models can not explain the hot subdwarfs which populate the most extreme clump of the hb in ngc2808 .",
    "in fact , together with @xmath1cen , m54 ( rosenberg et al .",
    "2004 ) , and ngc6388 ( busso , piotto & cassisi 2004 ) , ngc 2808 presents the phenomenon of extremely blue , sub  luminous hb members @xcite .",
    "these are objects with a luminosity lower than predicted by standard hb models , that is , models with a helium core mass determined by rg evolution terminated by the helium flash at the giant tip .",
    "@xcite discovered that hb structures can derive also by a helium flash taking place on the white dwarf cooling sequence , and the resulting luminosity can be up to 0.1 mag higher than found with standard models @xcite .",
    "still , the sub  luminous stars in @xmath1cen and ngc 2808 are up to 0.7 mag fainter than the standard hb , and so not understood in terms of hb structures .",
    "@xcite suggested that a late helium flash along the white dwarf cooling sequence can penetrate inside the hydrogen burning shell , whose weakness does not provide a sufficiently strong entropy barrier @xcite .",
    "the result would be a structure with an envelope rich in helium and carbon , with an effective temperature around 37000 k @xcite , while the hottest hb models lie around 31000 k @xcite .",
    "the difference in bolometric correction and the reduced atmospheric opacity below 912 @xmath17  produce the observed gap in visual magnitude .",
    "this means that these objects can not be modeled with precision .",
    "we will assume that some of the evolving red giants suffer a delayed helium flash followed by mixing , as proposed by @xcite , and will attribute this sequence of events to all the red giants having the highest y and thus the smallest initial mass .",
    "the mass on the hb is : @xmath18 where @xmath19  is given by eq .",
    "@xmath20  is the average mass lost during the rg phase , with a dispersion @xmath9 to be determined .",
    "simple simulations show that it is possible to interpret the red part of the hb as formed by stars with helium content y=0.24 , and the blue part as due to a population with enrichment in helium .",
    "we can derive important information by examining independently the distribution of stars in the red clump and along the blue side of the hb .",
    "once metallicity and age have been fixed , we adjust the average mass loss along the rg branch , and its dispersion , to fit the morphology of the hb red clump .",
    "the four panels in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] show simulations assuming an age of 13 gyr .",
    "similar results are obtained for different values of the age , provided that we adopt a smaller average @xmath20  to reproduce the red clump , if we adopt a larger age .",
    "the dispersion assumed around @xmath20  is relatively small : a @xmath21  is adequate .",
    "the red clump is so compact that a larger spread in the mass loss tends to populate also the blue side of the clump , contrary to the observations . on the basis of figure [ f4 ]",
    "we choose @xmath22 .",
    "once fitted the red clump , we can suppose that the same @xmath20 and the same dispersion apply also to the blue side of the hb , but that the location of the stars along this branch depends on the helium content .",
    "in other words , _ the mass along the blue hb varies mainly through the variation of @xmath19(y ) , as given by eq .",
    "[ eq1]_. thus , to obtain the lack of stars in the rr lyr region we need to suppose that the helium content on the reddest side of the blue hb is discontinuously larger than the helium content of the red clump .",
    "one full simulation for an age of 13 gyr is shown in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the clump is reproduced as in figure [ f4 ] , while for the blue side we assume that the helium content is randomly distributed between y=0.27 and y=0.32 .",
    "the minimum y=0.27 is necessary in order for the rr lyr region to remain unpopulated . in this simulation",
    "we attribute maximum observational errors of @xmath23 mag and @xmath24(b  v)=0.035mag .",
    "notice that our purpose here is not to obtain a  perfect \" reproduction of the hr diagram , but to obtain clues on the helium variation needed to explain the blue hb .",
    "+ an extra bonus of this interpretation of the hb morphology is that it gives an explanation of why the reddest stars of the blue hb are slightly more luminous than the red clump stars : in fact the different luminosities result naturally from the slight difference in the helium content of the red clump and of the red side of the blue hb .",
    "incidentally , we remind that there are also some metal rich gcs showing a substantial blue hb population , such as ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 @xcite .",
    "one of the debated problems about these clusters is that the horizontal part of their hb shows a marked slope ( the bluer stars being more luminous ) .",
    "this slope may be attributed to the same mechanism described here : the luminosity of the hb increases with  just because the helium abundance of the stars increases .",
    "+ the figures also show the histogram of the number densities obtained in the simulations compared to the number densities of the blue hb , as function of the absolute visual magnitude .",
    "two consequences follow :    * we need some additional hypothesis to populate the faintest clump .",
    "in particular , we can suppose that some of the stars with the largest helium content ( that is , with the smallest initial mass progenitor ) actually follow the paths described by @xcite and populate the hottest part of the blue hb .",
    "* the hypothesis of a random flat distribution in helium does not reproduce well the number densities : we can then reverse the problem , as we show in the next section .",
    "we can use the relative populations along the hb to infer how many stars correspond to a given helium content , for a fixed age and average mass loss , as shown in the left side fig .",
    "[ f6 ] for an age of 13 gyr .",
    "we assumed an average relation between the helium content and the absolute v magnitude , based on the results of the simulation of figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the number of stars - helium content distribution on the left side of figure [ f6 ] can be transformed into a relation between the number of stars now on the blue hb and the original agb progenitor star mass , if we know the helium content of the ejecta as function of the progenitor mass . from the results by @xcite",
    ", we adopt a simple linear relation between the average helium content in the ejecta and the progenitor mass .",
    "we use : @xmath25 the right side of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] shows the result : the blue hb contains stars whose progenitors range from @xmath104 to @xmath106.5 .",
    "of course this estimate is very rough : in particular , we have made the hypothesis that the population of the extreme clump can be obtained by extrapolating the average relation between helium content and absolute visual magnitude : this produces a  helium gap \" which is not real , as we have seen discussing the hottest subdwarf models in sect .",
    "we should now try to understand what are the implications of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] for the early evolution of this globular cluster .",
    "first it is necessary is to understand the mass requirements .",
    "the present day mass function of gc stars can be studied with sufficient precision only up to the turnoff , which is not larger than 0.9 .",
    "we describe the imf as made up of power laws having a form : @xmath26 where c is a constant depending on the total mass or number of stars . in the whole range up to 0.7 , @xcite find that the mfs of many gcs have very mild slopes ( x from @xmath27  to @xmath28 ) .",
    "the mf above 0.7is steeper , and although it is difficult to determine it with care , it can be assumed close to salpeter s slope ( x=1.3 ) .",

    "+ if ngc 2808 is made up by a first stellar population having standard helium content y=0.24 , from which , today , the stars populating the red clump of the hb evolve ( and not considering for the moment the loss of stars from the cluster ) , the number of clump stars provide a point of calibration of the imf .",

    "an imf of mild slope is therefore not to be ruled out : it may well be that in compact stellar systems the imf slope is mild , while it is much steeper in the general field , reflecting different processes of star formation , as @xcite suggest .",

    "\\3 ) actually , the process of formation of a second generation of stars can not be decoupled from the dynamical evolution of the cluster : during the first phases of life , the ims had time to segregate into the cluster central parts , where , for this reason , indeed the imf would look like those shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . ] .",
    "the ejecta of these stars gave birth to the second generation , but the external parts of the cluster , containing all the other first generation low mass stars , was lost , leaving the present proportion of first and second generation stars .",

    "[ f7 ] can be considered then simple examples of what actually should be obtained by considering the proper dynamic evolution of the cluster , including the loss of low mass stars from it .",
    "what seems to be clear is that , if the true imf of the first stellar population of gcs was similar to the field imf , we _ need that most of the low mass stars , today progenitors of the hb red clump , has been lost from the cluster_.      table [ tab1 ] lists some properties derived from the imfs shown in fig .",

    "of course , this work does not enter into the problems of loss of stability of the cluster , which however will be a powerful constraint on the reliability of each proposed imf .",
    "we wish to point out an additional possible consequence of our interpretation of the hb of ngc 2808 : it provides an appealing hint for the solution of a problem in gc stellar content : the amount of neutron stars ( ns ) and black holes ( bh ) .",
    "+ we can formally compute the number of nss and bhs for each of the imfs which satisfy the constraint posed by the blue hb , in the hypothesis that we are authorized to extrapolate their number to the mass range of ns and bh progenitors .",
    "the total number of ns is obtained by considering the progenitors between the upper mass which gives origin to agb stars ( 7 ) and 25 , and bh formation is considered between 25 and 100 .",
    "+ the large number of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) discovered in recent years in many gcs , and in particular the 20 msps discovered in the cluster 47 tuc @xcite indicate that the richest gcs may contain more than @xmath45  nss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a number embarassingly large .",
    "in fact , the number of nss predicted by a normal imf in ngc 2808 would be between 2600 and 14000 ( top of table [ tab1 ] ) , implying a retention factor from 7 to 40% , at variance with the characteristic kick speeds of single radiopulsar in the galaxy , which have an average @xmath46km / s @xcite , much larger than the escape velocity from typical clusters ( @xmath47km / s ) .",

    "+ the presence of stellar or intermediate mass bhs in globular clusters is exciting today a renewed interest .",
    "on the one side , recent observations by stis on hst of the velocity dispersion in the center of the cluster m15 seem to indicate the possible presence of a massive bh ( a few thousand ) in the core @xcite . on the other hand",

    "mass radii from the center @xcite .",
    "+ according to table [ tab1 ] , an important number of stellar mass black holes could have been formed in the cluster , with interesting consequences on its further dynamical evolution .",
    "bhs should have minor retention problems , as the galactic distribution of black hole x - ray binaries has a mean velocity of only @xmath1040 km s@xmath8 ( white & van paradijs 1996 ) , implying no or negligible kicks .",
    "however , close ( three or four  body ) dynamical encounters among bhs , may expell them from clusters , and in fact current n - body simulations ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) foresee no black hole or at most one black hole binary to remain in the cluster .",
    "in addition , even less is known about their detailed formation ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we have inferred their possible numbers by extrapolating the imf to masses an order of magnitude larger than our calibration point at @xmath48 . the numbers in table [ tab1 ] , therefore , should be taken as helpful indication , and certainly not as predictions . + as a final caveat , notice that the interaction between the agb winds and the stellar mass bhs possibly present in the central regions is not devoid of consequences , either as a help to the star formation mechanism , or as a sink of gas : the problem of the early evolution of gcs is all to be worked out .",
    "in this paper we have used the galactic gc ngc 2808 as a laboratory to experiment on recent ideas on the early evolution of gcs .",
    "the hb in this cluster shows a very peculiar morphology : it is well populated in the red clump and in the blue and extremely blue region , but almost devoid of stars in the rr lyr region .",
    "this morphology can be understood in terms of the coexistence of two stellar generations , separated by a difference between the helium content of the first one and the minimum helium content of the second one ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the small luminosity difference between the red and blue side of the horizontal part of the hb is also explained by this helium difference .",
    "+ the peculiar hb morphology of ngc 2808 is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the stars in many gcs were formed in two different events , a hypothesis primarily invoked to explain the abundance spreads in the light elements involved in the hot cno cycle @xcite . using an average relation between the progenitor agb mass and the helium content of its ejecta and the hb data by @xcite , we derive two points of the imf of the cluster stars : 1 ) the point at m=0.82 , that is the mass function value for the stars which today are found in the red clump , having the primordial helium content ; 2 ) the point for the mass range @xmath50 , whose ejecta should populate the most populous clump of the blue hb . although this second point is somewhat model dependent",
    ", it clearly results that we need many more agb stars than predicted by an imf similar to those inferred for many stellar environments @xcite .",
    "we favour then the possibility that many of the low mass stars of the first stellar generation have been lost , but a dynamical study of these first stages of star formation is needed . +",
    "we comment on the large number of nss and possibly also bhs which our model predict , and which would make easier to understand the population of millisecond pulsars in many gcs and the possible presence of intermediate mass bhs in the clusters m15 and ngc 6752 .",
    "+ as for possible checks of the proposed scenario , the disappearance of surface helium ( through sedimentation ) at temperatures at which it would become observable , makes direct measurements impossible .",
    "a way to check the multiple star generations hypothesis could be the accurate measurement of main sequence masses in double stars , as well as the detailed analysis of the behaviour of various cm diagram features , such as the magnitude difference between the rg branch bump and the turnoff .",
