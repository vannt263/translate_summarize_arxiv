    "nature of particulate flows offers the physics and engineering communities an opportunity to analyse the interesting behaviour of granular materials . from a  phenomenological point of view such a  flow ,",
    "being halfway between a  solid and a  liquid state , is not well understood because the basic physics is extremely complex . in a  local state ,",
    "the simplest form of the granular dynamics is as follows - during an arbitrary extortion particles move individually and during collisions particles may exchange their momenta and energies .",
    "therefore the collision process plays a  dominant role in the development of theoretical studies and also in the performance of simulations . for an understanding of the collision process",
    "we need to consider a  simple situation , focusing on what happens when two particles collide .",
    "in other words , we need to be able to distinguish the following basic phenomena : static contact  @xcite , cohesion  @xcite , attrition  @xcite , erosion  @xcite and fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena may occur simultaneously or respectively when an individual particle impacts with another .",
    "after impact separation  @xcite or clusterisation  @xcite of the two particles occurs . in addition , the particles may gain or loss mass . here",
    "we will focus on the dynamics of the collision process which may be decomposed into impact and contact processes .",
    "however , as the contact process is formed , we can also notice rebound  @xcite or static contact  @xcite , or permanent contact , called cohesion  @xcite .",
    "these processes exist simultaneously when we analyse the dynamics of colliding particles . with regard to the granular dynamics involving many particles in motion",
    ", we can observe multiparticle collisions  @xcite , especially when particle concentration is very dense , because collisional times between several binary particle contacts are higher in comparison to their separation times .",
    "multiparticle collisions occur when an individual particle collides with neighbouring particles , so that those contacts have direct a  influence on each other . only , an infinitesimally short collisional time is required for binary collisions  @xcite . in all the considered cases the collision process between the two particles is characterised through the collisional time , which is dependent on the impact energy and the physical properties of the contacting surfaces . moreover , after impact dissipation of energy occurs between the colliding particles",
    ". therefore the simulations of such dynamics are limited by assumptions concerning the collision process .",
    "one of the major aspects which needs to be taken into account in the simulations is how to control ( correlate ) the collisional time and the energy dissipation associated with an individual particle during the dynamics of multiparticle collisions .",
    "generally two different ways exist to model the dynamics of a  granular material .",
    "the continuum approach  @xcite is based on binary collisions of smooth spherical particles .",
    "unfortunately , the introduction of real quantities such as distribution of particle dimensions , particle shapes , their surface wetness and roughness , etc . , greatly limit the application of continuum models .",
    "balzer et al  @xcite inform us that the kinetic theory is useful for the modelling of gas - solid flow applications in industry : where the geometry involved is complex ( many different inlets or / and outlets ) .",
    "however , the kinetic theory can not reflect the real dynamics involved in multiparticle collisions because the collisional time is defined only for binary collisions .",
    "the discrete deterministic approach more realistically reflects the collision process .",
    "note that multiparticle collisions in the discrete approach are decomposed into several binary collisions . in this approach",
    "one may distinguish two general methods .",
    "the molecular dynamics method  @xcite takes into account an expression for the repulsive force acting between a  pair of contacting particles . in this method particles",
    "virtually overlap when a  contact occurs .",
    "the overlap reflects the quantitative deformations of particle surfaces because the modelling of realistic deformations would be much too complicated .",
    "the interaction laws  @xcite in the molecular dynamics method define basic models of the repulsive force for two colliding particles .",
    "they are valid for particle collisions which are independent from one another .",
    "the next method , called the event driven method  @xcite , assumes instantaneous changes in the direction and value of particle velocities according to conservation equations each time a  binary contact occurs .",
    "as shown in  @xcite the basic difference between the event driven and molecular dynamics methods is the collisional time between a  pair of particles . in the event driven method",
    "this time is ideally zero .",
    "note that this situation is quite different for the molecular dynamics method , where the contact time is greater than zero and is dependent on parameters describing the structure of two contacting surfaces , and is of course dependent on the impact energy .",
    "however , the repulsive force models in the molecular dynamics method underestimate the energy dissipation in multiparticle collisions  @xcite ( this is the so called `` detachment effect '' ) but in the event driven method an inelastic collapse  @xcite occurs .    in this paper we will focus on the molecular dynamics method because this gives us a  chance to correlate the collisional time and the energy dissipation during multiparticle collisions",
    ". we shall introduce a  novel mathematical description of this method taking into account the division of the collision process into an impact phase , a  contact phase and another phase occurring after the contact phase .",
    "we assume that the impact phase and the phase formed after the contact phase are infinitesimally short in time .",
    "consequently , we will analyse the well - known interaction laws of the repulsive force in the contact phase in order to examine several difficulties within the collisions . on the base of preliminary results  @xcite we shall introduce a  novel form of the repulsive force defined under fractional calculus  @xcite .",
    "we will also demonstrate the basic properties of this force and focus on what happens with the collisional time and the energy dissipation for multiparticle collisions .",
    "this analysis is necessary in computational simulations of the cluster dynamics . within the cluster one",
    "may notice non - permanent contact and/or cohesion phenomena between several pairs of colliding particles .",
    "let us turn our attention to a  set of spherical particles moving under arbitrary extortion .",
    "the spherical shape of the particle makes only the mathematical description easier and does not make the model in any way poorer .",
    "the reader may find in  @xcite more information concerning the molecular dynamics technique adapted to arbitrary form particle shapes .",
    "the particles are numbered by the discrete index @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of considered particles .",
    "we describe an individual particle through its radius @xmath2 ( or diameter @xmath3 ) , mass @xmath4 , inertia moment @xmath5 , position @xmath6 of the mass centre , linear speed @xmath7 and angular velocity @xmath8 .",
    "with regard to the collision of two individual particles we also introduce the natural function @xmath9 ( @xmath10 by assumption ) of a  particle @xmath11 in order to find the particle index of a  particle in a  set of particles @xmath1 .",
    "several papers  @xcite present different algorithms that detect particle collisions , being dependent on their shapes , and consequently that to find the natural function @xmath9 . for a  binary collision",
    "we neglect phenomena which cause a  change in the mass of an individual particle .",
    "thus in our discrete model we do not take into account fragmentation , attrition and erosion which eventually take place during the collision process .",
    "these phenomena will be the subject of future investigations .",
    "however , after the contact , which is the second phase of the collision process , rebound , non - permanent contact ( static contact ) or cohesion can arise simultaneously . in this paper , we will try to model above the phenomena by introducing a  novel mathematical description and a  novel form of the repulsive force into the molecular dynamics method .      starting from the description shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , let us introduce several definitions before formulating the motion equations .",
    "first , we assign local coordinates as @xmath12 and global ones as @xmath13 .",
    "when we consider a  contact which eventually takes place between two particles then the normal unit vector @xmath14 that connects the particle s centres of mass reads @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 represents a  norm calculated from the relative coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "tangential unit vectors which operate on a  tangent plane ( rotated by @xmath18 to the normal ) become @xmath19   \\frac{\\left\\vert \\mathbf{x}_{j(i)}-\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right\\vert }        { \\left\\vert \\mathbf{x}_{j(i)}-\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right\\vert _ { x , y}},\\ ] ] @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the norm which is calculated only in the tangent plane . when a  particle hits a  wall we redefine unit vectors  ( [ eq01 ] ) , ( [ eq02 ] ) and ( [ eq03 ] ) putting @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 , where @xmath22 is a  point whose coordinates issue from the line that crosses the particle s centre of mass and is perpendicular to the wall . the general form of the base vectors",
    "is presented as follows @xmath24.\\ ] ]    ]    fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] presents the `` virtual overlap '' @xmath25 of two particles experiencing a  contact . with regard to  @xcite",
    "we define the overlap as @xmath26 which is associated with the particles having spherical forms .",
    "note that only positive values of formula  ( [ eq04 ] ) indicate a  contact while negative ones confirm that the considered particles are in separation .",
    "this means that they move individually . as presented in previous section and in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , the overlap reflects the penetration depth of the particles in a  direction which connects the particle s centres of mass , pointing from @xmath11 to @xmath9 .",
    "we also introduce the penetration width of the particles defined as the direction perpendicular to the previous one .",
    "thus we have @xmath27 valid for @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a  vector which defines a  point @xmath30 of the application of the repulsive force , and which is taken as the mass centre of the overlapping region  ( [ eq04 ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . taking into consideration the fact the that particles have only spherical forms and collide when their overlap  ( [ eq04 ] ) is positive we obtain @xmath31 thus , at the beginning of a  collision we have @xmath32 and one can find an explicit time @xmath33 where the overlap  ( [ eq04 ] ) is zero .",
    "above notation allows us to analyse multiparticle collisions where an individual particle @xmath11 collides with neighbouring particles @xmath9 .",
    "therefore many overlaps  ( [ eq04 ] ) indexed @xmath9 on the particle @xmath11 may occur .",
    "this allows us to formulate the motion equations in the right form .",
    "next we introduce the relative velocity of a  particle @xmath11 and a  particle @xmath9 at point @xmath30 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are linear and rotational relative velocities and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are branch vectors connecting the mass centres of particles @xmath11 and @xmath9 with the point @xmath30 of application of the repulsive force .",
    "note that above values are defined for the global system of coordinates @xmath13 . to change this to the local system of coordinates we need to use the scalar product of the base vectors  ( [ eq003 ] ) per the vector of the relative velocity . calculating the branch vectors we obtain the following dependencies in the local system @xmath12 as @xmath39 , \\ ,   \\mathbf{s}_{j(i),i}^ { ' } = \\left [ 0,0 , \\left\\vert   \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\widetilde{\\widetilde{\\zeta}}$}}_{j(i ) } \\right\\vert\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 @xmath41 in the global system of coordinates the branch vectors",
    "become @xmath42 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq003 ] ) and  ( [ eq10 ] ) we translate the linear and rotational relative velocities in the global system of coordinates to the local one as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the relative velocities operating in the normal direction to the contacting surfaces as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] and @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] denote vectors of the relative velocities acting in the tangential direction ( rotated by @xmath18 to the normal ) .",
    "additionally we use the same translation as presented by expression  ( [ eq0013 ] ) for calculations @xmath48 @xmath49 in order to obtain the angular velocities for particles @xmath11 and @xmath9 in the local system of coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "if a  collision between a  particle and a  wall takes place , the overlap  ( [ eq04 ] ) is defined as @xmath50 and also we have @xmath51 which is valid for @xmath52 . in this case",
    "the point of application @xmath53 is defined by the following formula @xmath54 where @xmath55 becomes a  normal unit vector which is perpendicular to the wall .",
    "when a  particle - wall collision begins we obtain @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , one can find the explicit time @xmath57 when the overlap  ( [ eq16 ] ) is zero .",
    "expressions  ( [ eq10])@xmath58([eq0013 ] ) , defined for a  particle - particle collision , may be redefined in simple way for a  particle - wall collision when @xmath59 and @xmath60 are zeros and unit vectors are also redefined as explained in previous considerations .",
    "for example a  component of the branch vector  ( [ eq12 ] ) is redefined for a  particle - wall collision and takes the following form @xmath61 we neglect here any additional expressions necessary to describe the particle - wall collision .",
    "the reader can do this very easily in the same way as explained previously .",
    "summarising our considerations , we introduced the above mathematical description which is necessary for the formulation of the motion equations and is also necessary for some forms of the repulsive force , acting for both particle - particle and particle - wall collisions .",
    "the molecular dynamics method requires a  discrete deterministic approach in order to the model motion of an individual particle .",
    "note that the particle may collide or lose contact with other particles .",
    "therefore in motion equations we need to add or reject some forms of the repulsive force and/or the attractive force in order to simulate the particle dynamics more realistically . in this paper we neglect the attractive force and we will concentrate only on the repulsive force .",
    "aganist this background , let us describe the motion of an individual particle by the following two sets of equations @xmath62 suitable for particle motion without any collision , and @xmath63 which takes into account multiparticle collisions .",
    "the above sets of equations exist simultaneously over time and are dependent on the detection of a  contact and the administration of the repulsive force - overlap path during the contact . in both eqs .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) and  ( [ eq22 ] ) @xmath64 denotes an arbitrary force which extorts the motion of a  particle , @xmath65 is an arbitrary torque , @xmath66 is a  collisional force composed of the repulsive and friction forces and acts between a  pair of colliding particles , @xmath67 is also the collisional force operating on a  particle - wall collision , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are collisional torques definitively operating on particle - particle and particle - wall collision .",
    "we need to define some of the criteria necessary for handling the above two sets of equations over the time of the calculations .",
    "it was evidently shown in the previous subsection that for the beginning of a  collision the overlap given by expression  ( [ eq04 ] ) or  ( [ eq16 ] ) is zero .",
    "thus we have the impact phase . however , some of the criteria for determining when the collision ends are unclear . correctly predicting the separation time of two colliding particles is crucial in the calculation .",
    "most papers assume the particles separate at the time when the overlap returns to zero . as proved in  @xcite , the repulsive force changes direction at the time when the overlap returns to zero .",
    "this is contrary to experimental evidence , also shown and compared with some models in  @xcite , when the force does not change direction .",
    "an attractive force operating in opposite direction to the repulsive force has different origins and is not taken into account here .    at this crucial point of our considerations",
    ", we need to introduce some definitions in order to predict correctly the beginning time of a  particle collision and the time when the collision ends .",
    "let us consider the time of calculations @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the total time in which the calculations are performed .",
    "we also define the time step @xmath72 in which we trace the system dynamics .",
    "follow on from previous explanations we start with some conditions .",
    "if , within a  time interval @xmath73 detects the beginning of a  collision between a  pair of particles is detected then the overlap  ( [ eq04 ] ) should fulfil the following conditions @xmath74 and then time @xmath75 is the time when the collision starts .    if , within  a  time  interval  @xmath76 the end of a  collision is formed then the overlap  ( [ eq04 ] ) and the normal component of the repulsive force @xmath77 should fulfil the following conditions @xmath78 or @xmath79 and then time @xmath80 is the time when the collision ends .    in formulae  ( [ eq24 ] ) and  ( [ eq25 ] )",
    "@xmath77 represents a  normal component of the repulsive force .",
    "in the next subsection we will introduce a  definition of this force .    if , within a  time interval @xmath76 the overlap and the normal component of the repulsive force @xmath77 behave as follows @xmath81 then time @xmath82 is the time when the collision ends .",
    "when the condition  ( [ eq24 ] ) is fulfilled then linear and rotational components  ( [ eq0013 ] ) of the relative velocity predict the following states after the collision :    * rebound of particles without particle deformations for @xmath83 and @xmath84 has an opposite direction ( sign ) to @xmath85 , * torsion for @xmath86 or sliding for @xmath87 or rolling for @xmath88 of particles without particle deformations for @xmath89 , * non - permanent  or permanent stick  of particles without  particle deformations  for   @xmath90 and for @xmath91 .",
    "when the condition  ( [ eq25 ] ) is fulfilled then components  ( [ eq0013 ] ) of the relative velocity predict the same states as described by definition  4 but particle deformations are noted .",
    "when the condition  ( [ eq26 ] ) is fulfilled then the normal component @xmath84 of the relative velocity  ( [ eq0013 ] ) predicts adhesion - induced plastic deformations of particles or breakage of particles depending on the hardness of the contacting surfaces .    on the base of previous assumptions and definitions  1 and 2",
    "we introduce the collisional time between a  pair of contacting particles as @xmath92 . this time is determined by conditions  ( [ eq24 ] ) and  ( [ eq25 ] ) simultaneously . in other words ,",
    "when the overlap changes sign faster than the repulsive force changes direction or vice versa then the collision is finished .",
    "if particles are still in contact then the total contact time is significantly greater than the collisional time .",
    "if particles are separated then the total contact time equals the collisional time .",
    "as presented in the first section , the collisional process composes the impact phase , the contact phase and the last phase formed after the contact phase .",
    "moreover , when the formulation of the first and the last phases is infinitesimally short in time then the collisional time is predicted by the contact phase .",
    "the contact phase is predicted by the repulsive force - overlap path .",
    "the adhesion or cohesion states extend the contact phase over time to infinity . in our approach adhesion and cohesion",
    "are eventually formed after the impact and they represent completely different phenomena which definitely result from the collision process . generally , when we model impact dynamics we need to consider the balance between the repulsive force which is a  direct reaction to the impact , and the attractive forces which are a  result i.e. cohesion of particles .",
    "therefore , our collisional time @xmath93 also becomes the time of relaxation in which the collision process is stopped and novel states are formed .",
    "most papers neglect this fact and identify the total contact time , which may increase to infinity , as the collisional one .    extending our considerations",
    "we notice that definition  4 is suitable for the elastic collisions of particles because there are no deformations in contacting particles - the overlap tends to zero faster than the repulsive force changes direction . in definition  5",
    "we observe the opposite situation - the repulsive force changes direction faster than the overlap tends to zero . in our approach",
    "the collision process is fully controlled by the repulsive force except for the situation presented by formula  ( [ eq26 ] ) in definition  3 . on the basis of definition  6 , which results from definition  3 ,",
    "we are able to explain that the local stresses associated with deformations of contacting particles become sufficiently large so as to exceed the elastic limit of the materials to a  result plastic flow occurs  @xcite and the behaviour of particle adhesion differs from that predicted by the elastic deformation theory  @xcite .",
    "adhesion - induced plastic deformations of contacting materials are evidently shown in some experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore we have two possible states resulting from the impact : particle clusterisations when the colliding materials are soft , and fragmentation of particles when the colliding materials are hard .    summarising this subsection we formulated two general forms of the motion equations and discussed precisely how to handle them .      with regard to motion equations  ( [ eq22 ] )",
    "we introduce a  mathematical description of the collisional forces and torques occurring in such a  system . in the normal direction to the contacting surfaces we apply only a  repulsive force , completely neglecting any attractive forces . in  @xcite one can find some forms of attractive forces and their physical meanings . in a  tangential plane",
    "we introduce a  system of friction forces and torques . according to the friction mechanism ,",
    "the tangential friction force is one of four types : torsion with sliding friction , sliding friction , rolling friction or static friction .",
    "torsion friction occurs when colliding particles differ by their angular velocities in the normal direction @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "torsion with sliding friction is for colliding particles which have different angular velocities in the normal direction and different linear velocities in the tangential plane . sliding friction happens when slipping occurs in colliding particles .",
    "when the relative linear velocity of the particles in the tangent direction reduces to zero , sliding friction is replaced by rolling friction .",
    "if the external forces are sufficiently small , the rolling friction reduces the velocity until particle motion stops and static friction occurs .",
    "considering the impact dynamics , we implemented the following mechanism in general form : torsion with sliding friction can change to rolling friction and the rolling friction tends to static friction .",
    "more details concerning the modelling of torsion , sliding and rolling friction can be found in  @xcite .",
    "here we show a  description of the collisional force in global coordinates @xmath13 as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the force acting in a  static friction state , @xmath98 is the force occurring in a  rolling state and @xmath99 is the force coupling the torsion - sliding state .",
    "the emphasis in this paper is on the impact dynamics the static friction is only implemented in a  simple form .",
    "a  more detailed model of the static friction state requires analysis of the tangential displacement and possibly the inclusion of time dependent effects . according to fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] we need to define the collisional force in the local system of coordinates @xmath12 . using a  matrix of the base vectors  ( [ eq003 ] )",
    "we introduce transition from the local system to the global ones as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 are forces defined in the local system of coordinates as @xmath103,\\qquad \\mathbf{p}_{j(i)}^{'\\ , rol}=\\left [   \\begin{array}{l }    t_{\\xi\\ , j(i)}^{rol}\\\\ t_{\\eta\\ , j(i)}^{rol}\\\\ -r_{\\zeta\\ , j(i ) }   \\end{array }   \\right].\\ ] ] in expression  ( [ eq30 ] ) @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 represent components of the friction force in a  plane @xmath108 for torsion - sliding and rolling states , @xmath77 is a  sum of the normal components of attractive and repulsive forces operating during a  collision .",

    "[ fig02 ] shows the dynamics of a  two - particle collision , which is represented by some variations in the overlap @xmath184 ( [ eq04 ] ) , the linear relative velocity @xmath185 ( [ eq0013 ] ) and the repulsive force @xmath186 ( [ eq31 ] ) over time for different levels of the conversion degree @xmath187 here we neglect the index @xmath9 because only two particles collide .",

    "[ eq03 ] , when @xmath197 is above unity the repulsive force is not generated and this indicates instability in particle collisions .",
