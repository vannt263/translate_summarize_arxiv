    "in this work we construct the asymptotic solution of the perturbed davey - stewartson-1 equations ( ds-1 ) : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is small positive parameter , @xmath2 correspond to so called focusing or defocusing ds-1 equations .",
    "the equations ( [ ds1 ] ) describe the interaction between long and short waves on the liquid surface in case the capillary effects and potential flow are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the existence theorems for the solutions of this equations in the various functional classes are well - known @xcite .",
    "the inverse scattering transform method for the ds equations was formulated in @xcite@xcite .",
    "this method allows to construct solitons @xcite and to study global properties of the generic solutions , for instance , the asymptotic behaviour over large times @xcite . the asymptotics for nonintegrable ds equations were studied in @xcite .",
    "the perturbations of the equations ( [ ds1 ] ) arise due to a small irregularity of bottom or by taking into account the next corrections in more realistic models for the liquid surface considered in @xcite . for the first case the perturbation takes the form : @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is real constant and its sign corresponds to decreasing or increasing depth with respect to spatial variable @xmath5 .",
    "we start with the solution of ds-1 constructed in @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are positive constants defined by boundary conditions as @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is free complex parameter .",
    "this solution decreases with respect to spatial variables exponentially . besides if @xmath11 and @xmath12 this solution has singularities at some lines @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the solution ( [ q ] ) was called dromion in work @xcite . the inverse scattering method for dromion - like solution of ( [ ds1 ] ) was developed in @xcite . from the results of @xcite , @xcite and",
    "@xcite it follows that the soliton of the ds-2 equations is unstable with respect to small perturbation of the initial data .",
    "these results stimulate the studies of the dromion perturbation .    to construct the asymptotic solution over the large times",
    "we suppose the parameter @xmath10 depending on a slow time variable @xmath15 and obtain an explicit formula for the @xmath16 .",
    "the possibility of the full investigation of the linearized ds-1 equations plays the main role to construct the perturbation theory of the nonlinear ds-1 equations . for ( 1 + 1)-models it has been found in @xcite , that spectral functions of the lax pair form the basis of solutions of the linearized nonlinear pdes .",
    "the same idea is true for the ds-1 and ds-2 equations , as shown in @xcite , @xcite and it is used below .",
    "the asymptotic analysis given in this paper is valid for the solutions ( [ q ] ) without the singularities .",
    "it means if @xmath11 , then @xmath17 . if the coefficient of the perturbation @xmath18 , then @xmath19 increases with respect to slow time .",
    "it allows to say that the singularity may appear in the leading term of the asymptotics as @xmath20 .",
    "however we ca nt say this strongly for perturbed dromion in our situation , because our asymptotics is usable only when @xmath21 . in general case",
    "the appearance of the singularities in the solution of nonintegrable cases of the davey - stewartson equations is known phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the obtained result for the problem about the interaction between the long and short waves on the liquid surface shows when the depth decreases the formal asymptotic solution can be described by adiabatic perturbation theory of the dromion for the focusing ds-1 equations at least for @xmath22 .",

    "we apply the results of section 3 and construct the first correction of an asymptotic expansion for the solution of the problem formulated in section 1 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to reducing of a modulation equation for the dromion parameter . in appendix",
    "we demonstrate explicit formulas for functions which are used to obtain the basis set solving of the linearized ds-1 equations .",
    "we construct the asymptotic solution of equations ( [ ds1 ] ) on @xmath23 uniformly over large @xmath24 .",
    "the perturbation operator is @xmath3 and the boundary conditions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 are : @xmath27 we seek the asymptotic solution as a sum of two first terms of asymptotic expansions : @xmath28 where @xmath15 is slow time .",
