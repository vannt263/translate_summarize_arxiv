    "despite many years of dedicated research , the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of sne ia remain unclear .",
    "it is generally accepted that sne ia originate from thermonuclear explosions of massive carbon - oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems . depending on the nature of the companion star , two different progenitor systems have been proposed . in the _ single degenerate _",
    "scenario @xcite a carbon - oxygen white dwarf accretes from a non - degenerate companion star until it reaches the chandrasekhar - mass and explodes ( but note that an explosion before reaching the chandrasekhar mass may also be possible , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , in the _ double degenerate _",
    "scenario @xcite a merger of two carbon - oxygen white dwarfs causes a thermonuclear explosion of the merged system .",
    "many recent findings including sn rates from population synthesis studies @xcite , studies of the delay time distribution of observed sne ia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lack of radio emission of sne ia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lack of hydrogen emission in nebular spectra of sne ia @xcite , the lack of x - ray emission in elliptical galaxies @xcite and studies of sn ia remnants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seem to favor the double degenerate scenario .",
    "in addition , first studies of sn  2011fe seem to disfavor a single degenerate progenitor ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is , however , no unambiguous proof for any progenitor scenario yet . for a detailed discussion about constraints on the progenitor scenarios see @xcite .    to date , most theoretical work on sne ia has concentrated on the single degenerate scenario , as mergers of white dwarfs were thought not to lead to thermonuclear explosions .",
    "this was mainly based on the picture that mergers would leave behind the more massive white dwarf with a hot envelope made up of the material of the less massive white dwarf .",
    "fast accretion from the envelope will then turn the carbon - oxygen white dwarf into an oxygen - neon white dwarf @xcite which collapses to a neutron star as it approaches the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "ways to avoid the transformation of the carbon - oxygen white dwarf into an oxygen - neon white dwarf have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but without conclusive results .        recently , however , we demonstrated that violent mergers of two carbon - oxygen white dwarfs could directly lead to a thermonuclear explosion while the merger is still ongoing @xcite .",
    "we also showed that the observables for such an explosion with two white dwarfs of @xmath4 show good agreement with the observed properties of subluminous 1991bg - like sne ia .",
    "furthermore , we found that for a primary mass of @xmath4 a mass ratio of at least about @xmath5 is required for the scenario to work @xcite .",
    "lately , @xcite showed that using exact initial conditions can change the properties of the merger .",
    "in particular , this leads to a significantly longer inspiral in their simulations .",
    "however , @xcite were only able to run the simulation with a resolution of @xmath6 particles ( for comparison , the violent merger calculations by @xcite used @xmath7 particles ) .    in this work ,",
    "we combine high resolution merger simulations with exact initial conditions .",
    "we present the results of a simulation of the massive merger of a @xmath8 and a @xmath4 carbon - oxygen white dwarf .",
    "we follow the evolution of the binary system through the merger phase , thermonuclear explosion and nucleosynthesis .",
    "finally we use three - dimensional radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic lightcurves and spectra .",
    "the inspiral and merger is modeled using a modified version of the gadget code @xcite .",
    "modifications include the helmholtz equation of state @xcite and a 13 isotope nuclear reaction network that contains all @xmath9-elements from @xmath10 to @xmath3 .",
    "radiative cooling effects are not included in our simulation .",
    "a detailed description of the modifications will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in addition the maximum smoothing length of a particle was restricted to @xmath11 .",
    "this affects only particles ejected from the binary system during the merger but leads to a significant speedup of the code . since these particles are at very low densities and contain only less than one percent of the total mass , they have no noticable influence on the explosion dynamics and observables .",
    "the initial binary system consists of a @xmath8 and a @xmath4 carbon - oxygen white dwarf constructed from a total of @xmath12 equal - mass particles .",
    "both white dwarfs are set up in isolation and relaxed with an additional friction force for @xmath13 .",
    "we then apply the method described in @xcite to slowly move the two white dwarfs close together .",
    "when the first particle of the less massive white dwarf crosses the inner lagrange - point we stop and start the actual simulation . at this time , the binary system has an orbital period of about @xmath14 .     after the explosion of a slice in the x - z plane . the mass fraction is shown for carbon , oxygen , silicon , stable iron and radioactive @xmath3 . ]",
    "the evolution of the binary system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : merger ] .",
    "the mass transfer is stable for more than @xmath15 orbits .",
    "after about @xmath16 the secondary white dwarf becomes dynamically unstable and is disrupted on a timescale of one orbit .",
    "as the material of the secondary is accreted violently onto the primary , material is compressed and heated up on the surface of the primary white dwarf . as a consequence hotspots form in which carbon burning is ignited .",
    "when the first hotspot reaches a temperature larger than @xmath17 at a density of about @xmath18 we assume that a detonation forms @xcite .",
    "note that despite the high resolution we use , we still tend to underestimate the temperature in the hotspot compared to even higher resolution simulations @xcite .",
    "only future detailed investigations might be able to decide whether or not a detonation really forms but the conditions in our sph simulations suggest that it is plausible .    at this time we map the whole state of the simulation on a uniform cartesian grid with a resolution of @xmath19 grid cells and a box size of @xmath20 .",
    "about @xmath21 of material is lost by the mapping as it is outside the box . since this material makes up less than two percent of the total mass and has a density too low to contribute significantly to nuclear burning ( i.e. it stays unburned ) it does not affect the dynamics of the ejecta or the synthetic observables derived from the model .    with these initial conditions we use the leafs code @xcite that applies the level - set technique to model detonation",
    "flames @xcite .",
    "we ignite the detonation at the cell with the highest temperature and follow its propagation through the merged object until most of the material is burned .",
    "[ fig : merger ] shows that the primary white dwarf and most parts of the secondary are already burned @xmath22 after the detonation formed .",
    "the energy release from nuclear burning unbinds the object . using an expanding grid @xcite we follow the dynamic ejecta until they reach homologous expansion about @xmath13 after the detonation was ignited .",
    "they have an asymptotic kinetic energy of @xmath23 .",
    "in order to obtain detailed isotopic abundances of the ejecta we add @xmath24 tracer particles to the simulation of the explosion that record their local temperature and density . in a post - processing step",
    "we run a detailed nuclear network containing @xmath25 isotopes on these trajectories @xcite . to mimic the effect of solar metallicity we choose the initial composition of the tracer particles as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by mass .    in the explosion ,",
    "a total of @xmath29 of iron group elements are synthesized .",
    "they consist predominantly of radioactive @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) with a small fraction of stable @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and stable @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath36 of intermediate mass elements are produced in the explosion .",
    "the ejecta contain about @xmath37 of oxygen and about @xmath38 of unburned carbon .",
    "the spatial composition and density structure of the ejecta in homologous expansion are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] .",
    "its inherently three - dimensional structure is a result of the state of the merged object at the time the detonation forms .",
    "since the detonation propagates faster at higher densities , the primary white dwarf is burned first and its ashes expand .",
    "as they expand they sweep around the material of the partially intact secondary white dwarf that is still being burned .",
    "therefore , the ashes of the primary have already expanded significantly before burning of the secondary is completed ( roughly one second later ) , meaning that the ashes of the secondary completely dominate the center of the ejecta .",
    "hence , when the ejecta reach the homologous expansion phase several ten seconds later , the very inner parts of the ejecta do not contain material from the primary white dwarf and therefore no iron - group elements .",
    "lcccccc    @xmath39 & 18.6 & 18.0 & 20.8 & 23.2 & 21.6 + @xmath40 & 0.74 & 1.30 & 0.95 & 0.67 & 0.42 + @xmath41 & -19.2 & -19.6 & -19.0 & -19.2 & -19.2 + @xmath42 & -19.1 & -19.5 & -19.0 & -19.2 & -19.2 +    using the three - dimensional density structure from explosion modeling and the corresponding spatial abundance distribution from the tracer particles we apply the monte carlo radiative transfer code artis @xcite to calculate synthetic spectra and lightcurves for our model .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] shows angle - averaged and line - of - sight dependent lightcurves of our model compared with several well - observed normal sne ia .",
    "the angle - averaged lightcurves show good agreement with observations in the optical bands and reproduce general properties of normal sne  ia having a b - band rise time of @xmath43 days , a peak brightness of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in the u , b , and v band , respectively , and a light curve decline rate in the b band of @xmath47 ) .",
    "these values are well within the range of normal sne  ia @xcite .",
    "more detailed values for selected bands of the angle - averaged light curves are given in table  [ tab : lc_paras ] .",
    "in particular , the angle - averaged lightcurves in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 band agree very well with those observed for normal sne ia .",
    "the angle - averaged synthetic @xmath50-band lightcurve is about @xmath51 magnitudes fainter at maximum than the three supernovae we compare with and slightly brighter from @xmath52 days after maximum onwards .",
    "the angle - averaged @xmath53-band lightcurve of our model agrees well with the data up to about @xmath54 days after maximum , but declines slightly more slowly afterwards .    due to the asymmetric ejecta structure ,",
    "our model lightcurves show a non - negligible sensitivity to line - of - sight effects . in the @xmath50 band , for example",
    ", we find peak magnitudes between -19.5 and -18.7 . at the same time @xmath55",
    "varies between 0.5 and 1.4 , roughly along the phillips relation @xcite . for the @xmath48 band ,",
    "the scatter is even larger while it decreases in the redder bands . for lower photon energies ,",
    "the asymmetry of the ejecta is less important , since the optical depths are smaller and photons probe a larger fraction of the total ejecta , thereby making the observables less sensitive to line - of - sight effects ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the angle - averaged lightcurve of our model in the @xmath56 band agrees well with the observations up to maximum light .",
    "afterwards it is between @xmath57 and @xmath58 magnitudes brighter than our comparison sne ia .",
    "this offset ( in the @xmath56 band after maximum ) can be attributed to a flux excess in the caii nir triplet in the synthetic spectra .",
    "this could point to an over - abundance of calcium in the model .",
    "however , it is more likely to be a shortcoming of our radiative transfer treatment , which uses the simple van regemorter approximation @xcite to treat collisional excitation .",
    "thus we likely underestimate the effectiveness of cooling by forbidden transitions of heavy elements and therefore predict that too much cooling occurs via the strong dipole transitions of caii .",
    "there is good agreement between model and data in the nir bands ( @xmath59,@xmath60,@xmath61 ) . in particular ,",
    "our model reproduces time and brightness of the second peaks and even the light curve decline at more than @xmath62 days after maximum quite accurately .",
    "however , high precision modeling of the nir lightcurves requires an extensive atomic data set to properly simulate flux redistribution by fluorescence @xcite . here , however , we have restricted ourselves for computational reasons to a simplified atomic data set ( cd23_gf-5 of @xcite ) with only @xmath63 lines .",
    "this has been shown to give reliable results in the optical bands but slightly underpredicts the nir brightness @xcite between the primary and secondary peaks .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the angle - averaged spectrum of our model one day after b - band maximum . for comparison",
    "we overplot an observed spectrum of the normal sn  2003du @xcite at the same epoch .",
    "our model shows most of the characteristic features of sne  ia , particularly the defining siii doublet at @xmath646347,6371 but also the weaker siii features at @xmath645958,5979 and @xmath654128,4131 , the mgii triplet at @xmath664481 and the caii h and k absorption .",
    "the sii w - feature at @xmath675400  ( which is a blend of several lines ) is also visible though it is weaker than in sn  2003du . in the red tail of the spectrum",
    "the caii nir triplet is clearly visible as well as some indication of the oi triplet @xmath647772,7774,7775 .",
    "moreover , the overall spectral shape and the velocity - shifts of most of the line features in the observed spectrum are well reproduced , indicating that the velocity structure of our model is a good representation of that in real sne ia .",
    "the dominant parameter that determines the brightness of the explosion in our model is the mass of the primary white dwarf . in the merger",
    "the primary remains mostly unaffected whereas the secondary white dwarf is destroyed .",
    "therefore , because the density profile of the primary white dwarf to first order only depends on its mass and the density stays high enough to burn to iron - group elements ( @xmath3 ) only in the primary white dwarf , the brightness of the supernova directly correlates with the mass of the primary white dwarf .",
    "physical parameters of secondary importance are the mass of the secondary white dwarf and the composition of both white dwarfs ( c / o - ratio and metallicity ) .",
    "the material of the secondary is burned only to intermediate - mass elements and oxygen and therefore only affects the brightness of the explosion indirectly .",
    "the metallicity of the two white dwarfs has only a small impact on the final composition of the ejecta by changing the mixture of iron - group elements synthesized @xcite .",
    "the moment at which the detonation forms is an artificial parameter of our model .",
    "physically it will be determined by the properties of the binary system discussed above .",
    "since we can not resolve the formation of the detonation microscopically , however , we have to infer the most likely place and time for it to form from macroscopic properties .",
    "once we assume that a detonation forms on the surface of the primary its exact place and time are only secondary effects : the choice for the moment of detonation affects the densities at which the material of the secondary white dwarf is burned ( since the detonation occurs while the secondary is being destroyed ) but it does not strongly affect the burning of the primary because it is not dynamically affected by the merger .",
    "compared to the merger of two @xmath68 white dwarfs @xcite the merger we present here mainly differs in the mass of the primary white dwarf .",
    "since it is considerably more massive , its central density is higher and its material is burned predominantly to iron group elements .",
    "in addition , the mass ratio of the binary system we model here is well below unity .",
    "therefore , the more compact primary is not subject to noticeable tidal forces from the secondary .",
    "in addition , although exact initial conditions may weaken the merger , we show that it still leads to the formation of hot spots on the surface of the primary , in which densities and temperatures are sufficiently high that a detonation is plausible .",
    "this is consistent with the properties of hot spots seen in previous studies with less relaxed initial conditions @xcite and also with very recent simulations by @xcite who found similar hot spots in calculations with relaxed initial conditions and only slightly smaller resolution than our simulation .",
    "note that @xcite do not find hotspots in similar systems with exact initial conditions but more than a factor of ten fewer particles .",
    "our model can be interpreted as a pure detonation of an isolated sub - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf as described in @xcite with an additional component from the remains of the secondary white dwarf surrounding the system .",
    "quantitatively , however , the color lightcurves of our model agree significantly better with observations than the toy models of @xcite .",
    "in particular , our model also shows good agreement in the nir - bands and reproduces the position of the secondary peaks in these bands very well .",
    "this difference to the toy models is likely to be associated with a different density profile and composition structure in the inner parts of the ejecta . as discussed in section [ sec : nucleosynthesis ] this is a result of the presence of the secondary white dwarf and its interaction with ashes of the primary when they expand . also , the asymptotic kinetic energy per mass of the ejecta is smaller for our merger model than for detonations of isolated sub - chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs , because the burning of the secondary white dwarf is less complete and hence the average energy release per mass is smaller .",
    "overall , our explosion reproduces observational data of normal sne ia of the same brightness reasonably well . since the time span from the onset of mass transfer between the two white dwarfs until the ejecta reach homologous expansion is very short ( only of the order of a few minutes ) there is no extended outer envelope the explosion ejecta interact with later than a few minutes after the explosion , in contrast to the model by @xcite .",
    "observational constraints @xcite on the number of double white dwarf binaries significantly more massive than a chandrasekhar mass are still not very restrictive .",
    "if violent mergers contribute noticeably to the total sne ia rate , our calculations suggest that it will be hard to distinguish the merger events from the bulk of normal sne ia via optical / nir lightcurves and optical spectra .",
    "further detailed work is therefore needed to investigate whether there are other characteristic properties of sn ia explosions from violent white dwarf mergers and to explore how the observational display changes with the properties of their progenitor system .",
