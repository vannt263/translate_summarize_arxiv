    "exactly solvable models of quantum mechanical systems provide an important insight into the nature of quantum physics , with the simple harmonic oscillator and the non - relativistic hydrogen atom serving as the archetypal examples .",
    "one method to solve these models is to exploit an underlying algebraic structure , well known to be the lie algebra @xmath0 for the harmonic oscillator and @xmath1 for the hydrogen model @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the lie algebraic structure plays the role of generating states of the system while at the same time providing state labels ( or quantum numbers )",
    ". a celebrated exact solution of a quantum many - body model is that for the one - dimensional heisenberg ( spin 1/2 ) chain , due to bethe @xcite . out of",
    "this work grew the concept of the bethe ansatz for the construction of the eigenvectors for an exactly solvable hamiltonian . in adopting this method , a general possible form for an eigenvector",
    "is assumed , dependent on several free parameters .",
    "constraints are then determined for the parameters which ensure that this vector is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian .",
    "the constraint equations are referred to as the bethe ansatz equations of the model .",
    "motivated by bethe s work the field of exactly solvable models flourished during the 1960s led by mcguire @xcite , lieb @xcite , sutherland @xcite , yang @xcite and baxter @xcite , amongst many others .",
    "out of this activity arose the yang - baxter equation , the solution of which provides a sufficiency condition to construct a model which is exactly solvable ( applicable to one - dimensional quantum spin chains , including quantum field theories as the lattice spacing goes to zero , and classical two - dimensional lattice systems ) @xcite .",
    "a fundamental feature of the yang - baxter equation is that it can always be used to construct a family of mutually commuting matrices , known as transfer matrices , which facilitates the application of the bethe ansatz .",
    "the method of the bethe ansatz can take a variety of forms , commonly known as the co - ordinate , analytic , functional and algebraic forms .",
    "it is this latter approach that will be the focus of our work here , as this is the most appropriate to serve our requirements .",
    "the algebraic formulation of the bethe ansatz , and the associated quantum inverse scattering method , was primarily developed by the group of mathematical physicists in st .",
    "petersburg @xcite .",
    "its applicability extends beyond the study of one - dimensional spin chains , quantum field theory and two - dimensional lattice models to systems of correlated electrons @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , as well as precipitating the notion of quantum algebras ( deformations of universal enveloping algebras of lie algebras ) @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the algebraic formulation of the bethe ansatz was not only for calculating the energy spectrum of a model , but to also accommodate the calculation of correlation functions .",
    "an initial step in this direction is to compute the form factors of an operator ( not necessarily observable ) . here",
    "the term `` form factors of an operator '' simply refers to the matrix elements of that operator in the basis of hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "expectation values of observable operators and general correlation functions are expressible in terms of form factors through completeness relations .",
    "the study of correlation functions in the context of exactly solvable models has its origins in baxter s corner transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "following on from this there has been a rich theory developed using ideas taken from affine quantum algebras , vertex operators , integrable field theories , the off - shell bethe ansatz and the knizhnik - zamolodchikov equation @xcite , as well as the algebraic bethe ansatz approach ( e.g @xcite ) . for the models we will study here the calculation of form factors",
    "will be undertaken through extensive use of the slavnov formula @xcite for the scalar products of bethe eigenstates .",
    "the slavnov formula provides an explicit determinant representation for the scalar products .",
    "a refined proof of this result was given by kitanine , maillet and terras @xcite , using the notion of factorising the solutions of the yang - baxter equation in terms of drinfeld twists @xcite .",
    "they applied this method to successfully compute form factors for the anisotropic ( @xmath2 ) heisenberg chain @xcite , and in a closely related work korepin and slavnov computed form factors for the quantum non - linear schrdinger equation @xcite . in both cases the results are valid for finite size systems , and thus this approach is appropriate for applications to nanoscale systems .",
    "the results presented here are largely inspired by these works .",
    "the need to appeal to the exact solution of a model has been well illustrated in the context of the energy spectrum of metallic grains of nanoscale size .",
    "experiments conducted by ralph , black and tinkham ( rbt ) @xcite using single electron tunneling spectroscopy on aluminium grains with mean radii in the range 5 - 13 nm indicated significant parity effects due to the number of electrons in the system . the electron number remains fixed due to the large charging energy of the grains , which is a consequence of their small size . for grains with an odd number of electrons , the gap in the energy spectrum reduces with increasing size of the system , in contrast to the case of a grain with an even number of electrons , where a gap larger than the single electron energy levels persists . in the latter case",
    "the gap can be closed by a strongly applied magnetic field .",
    "the conclusion drawn from these results is that pairing interactions are prominent in these nanoscale systems . for a grain with an odd number of electrons there will always be at least one unpaired electron , so it is not necessary to break a cooper pair in order to create an excited state . for a grain with an even number of electrons , all excited states have a least one broken cooper pair , resulting in a gap in the spectrum . in the presence of a strongly applied magnetic field ,",
    "it is energetically more favourable for a grain with an even number of electrons to have broken pairs , and hence in this case there are excitations which show no gap in the spectrum .    a nave approach to describe these nanograins is to apply the theory of superconductivity due to bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bcs model is appropriate for these systems but the associated mean - field treatment fails .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first is because the bcs analysis makes use of the grand canonical ensemble whereas in the experiments the electron number is fixed .",
    "second is because a mean - field theory approximates certain operators in the model by an average value . at the nanoscale level ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations are sufficiently large enough that this approximation is invalid . in systems where the mean single particle energy level spacing , which is inversely proportional to the volume , is comparable to the bulk superconducting gap , ( as is for metallic nanograins , )",
    "it was thought that pairing interactions would not correlate any energy levels .",
    "this was conjectured by anderson @xcite on the basis of the bcs mean - field analysis , but the experiments of rbt show this to not be the case . consequently ,",
    "an exact solution was desired in order to clarify the issue .",
    "remarkably , the exact solution of the reduced bcs model ( `` reduced '' refers to the fact that only zero momentum cooper pairs are considered and all couplings for scattering of cooper pairs are equal ) had been obtained and analysed many years earlier in a series of works by richardson and sherman @xcite using an approach equivalent to the co - ordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "the motivation for their work was for application of pairing interactions in nuclear systems , which involve fixed particle number , and thus the bcs analysis referred above is not valid .",
    "however , the condensed matter physics community was unaware of this earlier work at the time the results of rbt were communicated .",
    "it was subsequently shown that theoretical results obtained through an analysis of the exact solution for the reduced bcs hamiltonian were compatible with the experimental results of rbt @xcite .",
    "one of the most currently active fields is the study of bose - einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the bose - einstein condensed state is of a purely quantum mechanical nature and , in analogy with the phenomena of superconducting metallic nanograins discussed above , a mean - field analysis of small scale systems comprised of bose - einstein condensates is inadequate due to significant quantum fluctuations . while there are many novel physical properties to be explored in the study of bose - einstein condensates , there are three features that we will discuss here .",
    "the first is the phenomenon of josephson tunneling between two coupled bose - einstein condensates .",
    "recall that the josephson effect was first proposed in relation to the tunneling of cooper pairs through an insulating barrier separating two superconductors @xcite .",
    "( a very informative historical account is given in @xcite . )",
    "it has been proposed as a means to couple qubits for the purpose of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the experimental realisation of bose - einstein condensation in the atomic alkali gases provides a framework in which to observe macroscopic tunneling in a system with tunable couplings .",
    "an extensive account of this phenomenon can be found in @xcite , which discusses in detail the canonical josephson hamiltonian ( equivalent to a two site bose - hubbard model ) for the description of this effect .",
    "it is not well known that this model is exactly solvable through the quantum inverse scattering method , which was established about a decade ago in the context of the discrete self - trapping dimer model @xcite .",
    "below we show that a slightly more general model is also exactly solvable and we derive explicit exact form factors for the generalised model .",
    "the second aspect of bose - einstein condensation we will discuss is that of a condensate comprised of a coherent superposition of atomic and molecular states . this phenomenon has been predicted and studied by theorists ( e.g. ,",
    "see @xcite ) and recently realised experimentally @xcite . in particular , for the experiment of @xcite using @xmath3rb atoms , which are converted into diatomic molecules via a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the system was prepared , allowed to evolve , and then a measurement made to determine the number of atoms in the system . by performing this procedure over different evolution times",
    "it was established that the expectation value for the number of atoms displayed an oscillatory behaviour , indicating that the state of the system was a quantum mechanical superposition of atomic and molecular states , as opposed to a classical mixture .",
    "the result is significant in that the state of the system is comprised of a superposition of two chemically distinct components .    finally , we will also analyse the reduced bcs model , which is relevant not only for metallic nanograins as described above , but also the study of ultracold fermionic atomic gases @xcite . as is well known , for an ultracold fermionic gas the pauli principle prohibits all particles occupying the lowest energy level .",
    "the lowest possible energy of the system is obtained by filling the fermi sea . however , in analogy with metals it is believed that fermionic gases should be able to form cooper pairs , and as a consequence , undergo a phase transition at a suitably low temperature into a fermionic condensate @xcite .    the aim of this exposition is to illustrate that the algebraic approach to the study of exactly solvable models is a rich and elegant theory with wide applicability .",
    "in particular we show how the theory applies to the systems of bose - einstein condensates and the reduced bcs model discussed above .",
    "some of these results have already been communicated @xcite , while other results we will present are new . in each case",
    "we will determine the energy spectrum , as well as the form factors for the computation of correlation functions , in terms of the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "certain correlation functions can in fact be deduced directly from the energy spectrum through use of the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite .",
    "examples of this procedure applied to the models discussed here can be found in @xcite .",
    "typically however , the form factor approach is required to build general formulae for expectation values and correlation functions . as a potential application of these results we point to the problem of quantifying entanglement in the theory of quantum information .",
    "the role of correlation functions in the characterisation of entanglement has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "throughout , we have endeavoured to provide as much technical detail as possible for the benefit of non - experts .",
    "the exceptions are the slavnov formula for the scalar product of states , the proof of which is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "for the proof we refer the interested reader to @xcite . also , the orthogonality of the bethe eigenstates will not be proved .",
    "details of this result can be found in @xcite .",
    "the format of the review is as follows .",
    "we begin in section 2 with a description of the four models we will examine . in section 3 we recall the basic features of the quantum inverse scattering method for the construction of exactly solvable models .",
    "while there already exist several excellent surveys of this approach @xcite , we give a detailed account here in order to fix notations and conventions and make the review self - contained .",
    "the central aspect is the introduction of the yang - baxter algebra associated with the lie algebra @xmath4 , which is a quadratic algebra .",
    "several examples of realisations are given .",
    "we show that in a particular limit , called the quasi - classical limit , the yang - baxter algebra reduces to a lie algebra , called the gaudin algebra . through a realisation of the yang - baxter algebra ,",
    "the transfer matrix is constructed which leads to an exactly solvable model .",
    "we also discuss a natural @xmath5-graded structure of the yang - baxter algebra which will be exploited in later constructions .",
    "section 4 deals with the algebraic bethe ansatz method in a general context for the determination of the spectrum of the transfer matrix .",
    "section 5 presents the slavnov formula for the scalar products of the states which arise in the algebraic bethe ansatz method of solution .",
    "we also discuss how , through the use of the slavnov formula , the form factors for the elements of the yang - baxter algebra can be obtained .",
    "section 6 turns to calculating the explicit exact solutions for the models .",
    "formulae for the energy spectrum are determined , which are parameterised in terms of the roots of the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "section 7 deals with the computation of form factors for each of the models introduced . in all cases",
    "it is necessary to first consider the solution to the inverse problem , which involves expressing a given operator in terms of the elements of the yang - baxter algebra .",
    "this needs to be studied on a case by case basis .",
    "once this is achieved , the form factors for that operator can be determined .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 8 .",
    "here we present , and give a description of , three models for bose - einstein condensates and the reduced bcs model .",
    "our main objective is to establish that each model is exactly solvable through the algebraic bethe ansatz . throughout , there are no constraints imposed on the coupling parameters for all models other than they are real , which is to ensure hermiticity .        the above hamiltonian under the constraint @xmath13 has been studied widely using techniques other than the exact solution @xcite . for this case",
    "it is useful to divide the parameter space into three regimes ; viz .",
    "rabi ( @xmath14 ) , josephson ( @xmath15 ) and fock ( @xmath16 ) . in the rabi and josephson regions",
    "one expects coherent superposition of the two condensates to be possible whereas in the fock region the two condensates will be , in some sense , localised .",
    "there is a correspondence between ( [ jo ] ) and the motion of a pendulum @xcite . in the rabi and josephson regions",
    "this motion is semiclassical , ( i.e. , the energy level spacings are of order less than @xmath17 , ) in contrast to the fock case .",
    "for both the fock and josephson regimes the analogy corresponds to a pendulum with fixed length , while in the rabi regime the length varies .",
    "an important problem is to study the behaviour in the crossover regimes , particularly between the josephson and fock regimes which are the most likely to occur in an experimental context @xcite .",
    "a reliable method to do this is through the exact solution .",
    "the motivation to extend the solution to the case where the couplings @xmath18 for the @xmath10-wave scattering terms can be chosen arbitrarily is for the description of a pair of cooper pair boxes with capacitive coupling @xcite . in the limit @xmath19 , then @xmath20 , in which case the model can be considered as a single cooper pair box coupled to a reservoir .",
    "next we turn our attention to a two - mode model for an atomic - molecular bose - einstein condensate with identical atoms .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form h&= & u_aa n_a^2+u_acn_an_c+u_cc n_c^2 + _ a n_a+_c n_c + & & + ( a^a^c + c^a a ) [ acham ] which acts on a basis of fock states analogous to ( [ fock ] ) . here , @xmath21 is the creation operator for an atomic mode while @xmath22 creates a molecular mode .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 again describe @xmath10-wave scattering , @xmath11 are chemical potentials and @xmath23 is the amplitude for interconversion of atoms and molecules .",
    "the hamiltonian commutes with the total atom number @xmath24 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath25 this model was studied in @xcite , and analysed numerically in @xcite based on the bethe ansatz solution . however , in order to compare with experimental results , in which the @xmath10-wave scatterings are significant , one needs to analyse ( [ acham ] ) in its full generality .",
    "estimates for the @xmath10-wave scattering parameters in the case of @xmath26rb are given in @xcite .",
    "the previous model can be extended to describe an atomic - molecular bose - einstein condensate with two distinct species of atoms , denoted @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which can combine to produce a molecule @xmath29 . for this case",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form h&= & u_aa n_a^2+u_bb n_b^2 + u_cc n_c^2 + u_abn_an_b+u_ac n_an_c+u_bcn_bn_c + & & + _ a n_a+_b n_b+_c n_c + ( a^b^c + c^b a ) [ abcham ] which commutes with @xmath30 and the total atom number @xmath31 . here",
    "the model acts on the fock space spanned by the vectors @xmath32 let us point out that in the limit @xmath33 , equation ( [ abcham ] ) is the hamiltonian studied in @xcite modelling second harmonic generation in quantum optics .",
    "non - zero values of these parameters correspond to a kerr effect .",
    "the physical properties of a metallic nanograin with pairing interactions are described by the reduced bcs hamiltonian @xcite h=_j=1^_jn_j -g_j , k=1^c_k+^c_k-^c_j - c_j+ .",

    "the operators @xmath38 are the annihilation and creation operators for the fermions at level @xmath37 .",
    "the labels @xmath39 refer to time reversed states .",
    "one of the features of the hamiltonian ( [ bcs ] ) is the _ blocking effect_. for any unpaired fermion at level @xmath37 the action of the pairing interaction is zero since only paired fermions are scattered .",
    "this means that the hilbert space can be decoupled into a product of paired and unpaired fermion states in which the action of the hamiltonian on the space for the unpaired fermions is automatically diagonal in the natural basis . in view of the blocking effect ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce hard - core boson operators @xmath40 which satisfy the relations ( b^_j)^2=0 ,  [ b_j , b_k^]=_jk(1 - 2b^_jb_j )  [ b_j , b_k]=[b^_j , b^_k]=0 [ hcb ] on the space excluding single particle states . in this setting the hard - core boson operators realise the @xmath41 algebra in the pseudo - spin representation , which will be utilised below .    the original approach of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer @xcite to describe the phenomenon of superconductivity in a bulk system was to employ a mean - field theory using a variational wavefunction for the ground state |>=_i=1^(u_ii+v_ib_i^)|0 > [ bcswf ] which has an undetermined number of electrons .",
    "the expectation value for the number operator is then fixed by means of a chemical potential term @xmath42 ; i.e. the grand canonical ensemble is used .",
    "one of the predictions of the bcs theory is that the number of cooper pairs in the ground state of the system is given by the ratio @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bcs `` bulk gap '' and @xmath45 is the mean level spacing for the single electron energies . for nanoscale systems ,",
    "this ratio is of the order of unity , in seeming contradiction with the experimental results discussed above .",
    "the explanation for this is that the mean - field approach is inappropriate in this instance , as previously indicated .",

    "we have reviewed the theory of the quantum inverse scattering method and algebraic bethe ansatz for the computation of energy spectra and form factors in exactly solvable models , and demonstrated how it applies to several models of bose - einstein condensates and the reduced bcs model . throughout",
    "we have only used the specific example of the yang - baxter algebra associated with the lie algebra @xmath4 . however",
    ", a yang - baxter algebra can be associated with any simple lie algebra , lie superalgebra , and the @xmath376-deformations of these structures .",
    "hence the theory can be applied on a much wider level .",
    "for example , generalised bcs systems derived from yang - baxter algebras associated with the lie algebras @xmath377 and @xmath378 and the lie superalgebra @xmath379 were derived in @xcite respectively . the model obtained in @xcite",
    "was proposed by richardson in 1966 to describe proton - neutron pairing in nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "the case of a general lie algebra was examined in @xcite in the context of the knizhnik - zamolodchikov equation .",
    "one major challenge which remains is to extend the slavnov formula for the scalar products of states to the general case .",
    "in fact there has been little progress on this aspect with the exceptions of the work by reshetikhin on the norms of the wavefunctions for models derived from the @xmath0 yang - baxter algebra @xcite and by ghmann and korepin on the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "another approach based on the knizhnik - zamolodchikov equation for @xmath380 can be found in @xcite .    in the method we have described the exact solution",
    "is parameterised in terms of the bethe ansatz equations , which can not be solved analytically .",
    "consequently numerical analysis of the solutions must be undertaken .",
    "for the bcs model there have been quite a number of works on this topic ( e.g. see @xcite ) . for the models of bose - einstein condensates the only numerical analysis of an exact solution , of which we know , is in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to conduct an asymptotic analysis of the bethe ansatz equations to find the exact asymptotic behaviour of the energy spectrum and correlation functions .",
