    "it should be noted that this is possible due to the existence of the unique parameter @xmath37 associated with the scherk - schwarz mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the above discussion on low - energy effective theory is based on classical considerations of the mass terms ( except for the higgs scalar @xmath96 ) in the previous subsection . in general",
    "if we take into account quantum corrections for the mass terms , they suffer from the correction of order @xmath176 , like the higgs scalar .",
    "this may modify the massless modes at the tree level and make them superheavy .",
    "they are decoupled from low - energy physics .",
    "therefore , the effective theory may be different from the one obtained from the classical consideration .",
    "if @xmath16 is large , the quantum corrections are suppressed , so that the classical consideration may be a good approximation for the effective theory .",
    "the particle can still remain massless even after taking into account the quantum corrections if they are the nambu - goldstone boson , for example , associated with the breakdown of symmetry . and the limit defined in eq .",
    "( [ limitb ] ) is an example of obtaining massive particles at low energies .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of the nonintegrable phases in @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with @xmath6 numbers of massless adjoint matter .",
    "we have resorted to the scherk - schwarz mechanism , by which supersymmetry is broken softly , in order to obtain the nonvanishing effective potential for the phases in perturbation theory .",
    "we have found that the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken dynamically to its maximal commutative subgroup , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath2 . this result does not depend on the values of the supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath37 , which is the boundary condition of the fields @xmath81 for the @xmath11 direction .",
    "this is remarkable if we compare our model with nonsupersymmetric gauge theories , in which rich symmetry breaking patterns are possible , depending on the values of the boundary conditions of the fields .",
    "we have obtained the mass of the higgs scalar @xmath96 , which is originally the component gauge field for the compactified direction .",
    "the mass is generated through the quantum corrections in the extra dimensions .",
    "the mass term respects the residual gauge symmetry @xmath2 and explicitly depends on the gauge coupling @xmath21 , the supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath37 , and the number of flavor @xmath6 .",
    "the higgs boson mass suffers from a correction of @xmath133 .",
    "we have also obtained the mass spectrum in three dimensions and discussed the low - energy effective theory in the limit of the small extra dimensions .",
    "all the effects of the extra dimensions are decoupled from low energies in the naive limit of @xmath173 since the relevant mass scale is given by the compactification scale @xmath154 as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ gauge])-([quark ] ) .",
    "we have considered the nontrivial limit defined by eq .",
    "( [ limitb ] ) .",
    "the nontrivial limit is possible thanks to the supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath37 of the scherk - schwarz mechanism .",
    "the mass of the higgs scalar becomes finite in the limit , and the higgs scalar survives at low energies .",
    "this implies that the quantum corrections in the extra dimensions become manifest in the low - energy physics even in the limit of the small extra dimensions .",
    "the limit also makes the masses of the gaugino @xmath18 and squark @xmath38 finite , so that the superparticles come into play at low energies .    concerning the limit defined by eq .",
    "( [ limitb ] ) , let us comment on the gauge coupling constant in the low - energy effective theory . if we start with a space - time @xmath177 and assume that the size of the extra dimensions is equal to @xmath178 , then the dimensionless gauge coupling constant in @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 .",
    "the trilinear and quartic coupling constants arising from the covariant derivative have the form @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively . and",
    "the mass of the higgs scalar is scaled on the dimensional ground as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 . as long as @xmath185 is finite and",
    "we take the limit ( [ limitb ] ) , the coupling constants and the mass of the higgs scalar are finite at low energies",
    ".    it may be interesting to introduce the matter fields belonging to the fundamental representation under the @xmath0 gauge group in addition to the adjoint matter . then , unlike the present case , we may expect rich patterns of gauge symmetry breaking and realistic low - energy effective theories .",
    "these are under investigation .",
