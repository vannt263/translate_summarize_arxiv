    "transition metal surfaces are attracting a wide scientific and technological interest , especially because of their capability of reducing the activation barrier of many important chemical reactions . one particularly relevant example is the reaction 2co + 2no @xmath2 2co@xmath3 + n@xmath3 , which eliminates the two poisonous co and no gases from the exhaust gas of combustion engines .",
    "this reaction is catalysed by many transition metal surfaces , among which rhodium and platinum have been demonstrated to be the most efficient .",
    "adsorption of atomic or molecular species on surfaces modifies their electronic and structural properties , thus affecting their catalytic properties .",
    "recently , the ( 001 ) surfaces of rhodium and nickel have been studied with respect to their peculiar reconstructions upon oxygen , carbon and nitrogen adsorption @xcite .",
    "oxygen adsorption on rh ( 001 ) is known to be dissociative and to saturate at half a monolayer , independently of the adsorption temperature . at this coverage",
    "a @xmath4 reconstruction has been observed by leed @xcite and confirmed by stm @xcite .",
    "the oxygen atoms sit in the troughs formed by four first - layer rhodium atoms and fill these sites in a c(@xmath5 ) geometry .",
    "this structure may be seen as a chess - board whose _ black _ squares are occupied by oxygen atoms , while the _ white _ ones are empty . within this picture ,",
    "the reconstruction observed in ref .",
    "@xcite has been described as a rotation of the _ black _ squares , resulting in a ( @xmath6)p4 g symmetry ( see fig . [",
    "ricostruzione]a ) .",
    "this distortion preserves the shape of the _ black _ squares , while the _ white _ ones become rhomboid .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for nitrogen and carbon adsorbed on the ( 001 ) surface of nickel , where the rotation angle of the squares is much larger and the _ clock _",
    "reconstruction more evident @xcite .    in our previous work on rh(001)/o",
    "@xcite we pointed out that a different substrate reconstruction is actually compatible with leed and stm data . using only these two experimental techniques it is not possible to distinguish between the reconstruction described above and the one which results instead from the rotation of the _ white _ squares ( fig .",
    "[ ricostruzione]b ) .",
    "our calculations actually indicated that it is the _ white _ squares which rotate rather than the _ black _ ones .",
    "moreover , we predicted a reconstruction pattern with a slightly different symmetry from what appears in the stm pictures .",
    "we found that the ad - atoms get off the center of the distorted squares , thus resulting in an _ asymmetric clock _ reconstruction ( fig .",
    "[ nuovastruttura ] ) .",
    "the oxygen atoms can occupy two equivalent low - symmetry sites separated by a low energy barrier , of the order of the room thermal energy .",
    "this would give rise to an order - disorder transition , and we suggested that what is actually observed in the stm pictures is the average position of the oxygen atoms jumping back and forth between the two equilibrium positions , in the high - temperature disordered phase .",
    "the reconstruction of the ( 001 ) surface of nickel upon c and n adsorption is experimentally much better characterized since also leed - iv @xcite and sexafs @xcite data exist . in this case",
    "it is widely accepted that the reconstruction is of the _ black _ type , i.e. it is the filled squares which rotate ( fig . [ ricostruzione]a ) .",
    "no surface reconstruction is induced by oxygen adsorption on ni(001 ) @xcite , while as far as we know no experimental data exist for carbon or nitrogen adsorbed on the rh(001 ) surface .    in this paper",
    "we present an _ ab - initio _ study of the adsorption of carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen on the ( 001 ) surfaces of rhodium and nickel . on rhodium",
    ", we find that _ neither _ nitrogen , _ nor _ carbon , induce any reconstruction of the surface . on nickel , in agreement with the experiments , we find that _ both _ carbon and nitrogen induce a _ clock _ reconstruction , while oxygen adsorbs with no induced reconstruction .",
    "we discuss the interplay of the chemical and the steric effects which is at the root of these behaviors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ method ]",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : riassunto ]      results for the o / rh(001 ) surface have been reported and extensively discussed in our previous work @xcite . for this system we have found that oxygen induces an _ asymmetric clock _",
    "reconstruction of _ white _ type ( fig .",
    "[ nuovastruttura ] ) , where the oxygen - filled sites are deformed into rhombi , and the ad - atoms get off the center of the rhombi . the asymmetric position of the oxygen ad - atoms results in a buckling reconstruction of the first surface layer , and the rhodium rows are alternatively shifted up and down by @xmath20  .",
    "oxygen atoms tend to shorten the bonds with the neighboring rhodium atoms , and this results in a deformation of the oxygen site which becomes a rhombus .",
    "we argued that the driving mechanism for this reconstruction is the re - bonding of the oxygen with the first layer rhodium surface .",
    "this can be better understood by the inspection of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "the ldos is the projection of the density of states onto localized atomic orbitals . in fig .",
    "[ ldosrho]a we display the rh@xmath21 ldos of one rhodium surface atom resulting from a calculation with the clean surface ; this is degenerate with the rh@xmath22 orbital because of symmetry .",
    "the energy is referred to the fermi level . in the panel just below ( b ) we display the same two orbitals after half a monolayer of oxygen is deposited , without allowing the substrate to reconstruct .",
    "the rh@xmath21 orbital points towards the square site left empty , and its ldos is very similar to what it would be for the clean surface .",
    "the rh@xmath22 orbital is directed towards the oxygen adsorption site , and the shape of its ldos changes completely upon adsorption : the most important feature is the presence of two peaks , one at @xmath23 ev and the second above the fermi energy , at @xmath24 ev . in the ( c )",
    "panel we display the ldos projected onto o@xmath25 orbitals , which are degenerate with the o@xmath26 orbitals because of the symmetry of the oxygen site .",
    "this ldos is characterized by a bonding and an anti - bonding peak , at energies of @xmath23 ev and @xmath27 ev respectively , which are in the same positions of the peaks observed in the rh@xmath22 ldos .",
    "we interpret this fact as the evidence of the presence of a strong covalent bond between the oxygen atoms and the rhodium surface atoms .",
    "the different weight between the bonding and the anti - bonding peaks also indicates that there is a charge transfer from the substrate to the oxygen , so that the bond is partially ionic",
    ". this fact is also supported by work function calculations , which show an increase of @xmath28 ev when the surface is covered by oxygen .",
    "this imply that an excess of negative charge is present on the surface .",
    "in the last panel of the figure we display the ldos projected onto the o@xmath25 and o@xmath26 orbitals for the reconstructed surface .",
    "the reconstruction lifts the @xmath29 symmetry , and the o@xmath25 orbital  which corresponds to the shorter o - rh bond  becomes more occupied than the o@xmath26 orbital .",
    "we conclude that the mechanism of the reconstruction is due to the re - bonding of the oxygen with the surface atoms , which tend to shorten the o - rh bond .",
    "this shortening could also be realized by a penetration of the oxygen deeper into the site , but this does not happen .",
    "the reason is maybe the excess of negative charge on the oxygen atoms , which prevents their penetration into the electronic sea of the metallic surface .",
    "while the present work was being completed , we learnt that our theoretical predictions have been recently confirmed by leed i - v experiments @xcite . in particular , the analysis of the leed i - v spectra indicated that the reconstruction of the rh surface upon oxygen adsorption is indeed of the _ white _ type . furthermore , the stable adsorption site of the oxygen adatoms was found to be asymmetric with respect to the center of the rhombus , with a displacement @xmath30 , to be compared with our theoretical prediction , @xmath31 .",
    "these data are in partial agreement with the recently published results of an experiment based on a combination of leed with low - energy alkali ion scattering and recoil spectroscopy @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite no evidence was found of the _ asymmetric white _ clock reconstruction predicted by us and confirmed in ref .",
    "furthermore , the height of the o adsorption site off the metal surface was found to be smaller than our predictions which , however , are again in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .    at variance with oxygen",
    ", nitrogen does not induce any reconstruction upon adsorption on rh(001 ) .",
    "the equilibrium distance of the adatom from the metal surface is rather large , as it is the case for oxygen ( see table [ tab : riassunto ] ) . for carbon",
    "we have found a metastable state with a surface reconstruction of the _ black _ type ( fig .",
    "[ ricostruzione]a ) and a rather small distance between the ad - atoms and the metal surfaces ( see the discussion of the _ black _ reconstructions typical of ni in the next subsession ) . however , the energy of this local minimum is higher than that of the unreconstructed surface , which corresponds to a larger ad - atom / surface equilibrium distance .",
    "the presence of this second stable deep site , even though the energy is higher , suggests that the choice of the actual adsorption site is a tradeoff between the chemical energy gained due to the larger number of ad - atom - rh bonds in the deep site , and the elastic energy lost due the distortion of the surface when this site is occupied .",
    "we shall comment more on this issue in the next section .",
    "in agreement with experimental data @xcite , for o / ni(001 ) we did not find any reconstruction at all . in this case the only effect that has been observed is a buckling in the second metal layer , whose atoms are not all coplanar but shifted up or down according to whether the fourfold site lying above is empty or filled @xcite .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our interpretation of the o / rh(001 ) reconstruction : the nickel lattice parameter is quite smaller than that of rhodium , and therefore the adsorption site is already small enough for the oxygen ad - atoms to bind with neighboring metal atoms without inducing any reconstruction . for the carbon- and nitrogen - covered surface",
    "we have found a reconstruction where  contrary to o : rh(001 ) and in agreement with experiments findings @xcite  it is the _ filled _ squares which rotate , i.e. a _ black _ reconstruction ( fig . [ ricostruzione]a ) . in the case of carbon , we find that no energy barrier exists between the unreconstructed and the reconstructed structures , whereas such a barrier has been detected for n : ni(001)though its value has not been determined .",
    "going back to the results summarized in table [ tab : riassunto ] , an inspection of the results for @xmath32 ( the distance between the adsorbate atoms and the first metal layer ) is particularly instructive . in those cases where a _ black _ reconstruction occurs ( c : ni and",
    "n : ni ) , @xmath32 is small ( @xmath33 ) , thus indicating that the adsorbates penetrate the first metal layer .",
    "the penetration of the adsorbate into the metal determines an _ outward _ ( with respect to the center of the square ) force acting on the metal atoms at the corners of the _ black _ squares .",
    "this can be alternatively be described as an _ inward _ force as seen from the center of the _ white _ squares . in the case of a _ white _ reconstruction ( o : rh ) , instead , the ad - atom stays out of the surface ( @xmath34 ) , and they pull directly the neighboring atoms towards the adsorption site ( rather than pushing them away from it ) in order to strengthen the o - metal bonds . in both cases ,",
    "the square which is ` squeezed ' by the adsorption process ( _ black _ or _ white _ , depending on the case ) , displays an instability towards a rhomboid distortion which is partially opposed by the elastic reaction of the substrate .    it is worth noting that in the cases where a _ black _ reconstruction occurs  and , hence , @xmath32 is small  the unreconstructed structure is a metastable ( n / ni ) or unstable ( c / ni ) equilibrium structure characterized by a rather large value of @xmath32 ( equal to 0.48   for both n / ni and c / ni ) . in order to understand the chemistry of the bond between carbon and nickel we have analyzed the local density of states for the unreconstructed and reconstructed surfaces , which we display in fig .",
    "in the two upper panels we show the ldos projected onto the c @xmath35 or @xmath36 orbitals which are degenerate by symmetry ( left ) and onto the c @xmath37 orbital ( right ) . in both cases a bonding and an anti - bonding structure can be clearly identified .",
    "in the case of the c @xmath38 orbitals , the bonding structure is resonant with similar structures observed in the ldos projected onto the ni @xmath39 and @xmath40 orbitals , while the c @xmath37 bonding structure is resonant with ni @xmath41 ( middle panels ) . inspection of the difference between the c @xmath38 and c @xmath37projected ldos before and after reconstruction shows that the gain in binding energy upon reconstruction mainly comes from a shift of the c @xmath37 ldos towards lower energies , thus indicating the establishment of a covalent - like bond between the c @xmath37 and ni @xmath41 orbitals .",
    "the behavior of the two surfaces studied here ( ni(001 ) and rh(001 ) ) is apparently very similar  they have the same stm images and leed patterns  but a more accurate inspection of their structural and electronic properties reveals many interesting differences .",
    "the most important one is that , in spite of the fact that the adsorption site of the adatoms is the same , the kind of reconstruction induced by them is different for o / rh(001 ) and for c / ni(001 ) or n / ni(001 ) . in the first case the oxygen site is deformed into a rhombus ( _ white _ reconstruction ) , while in the second case the adsorption sites remain square , and it is the empty sites which are deformed into rhombi ( _ black _ reconstruction , see fig . [ ricostruzione]a ) .",
    "secondly , on rhodium the distance of the oxygen atoms from the surface is not appreciably different for the unreconstructed and the reconstructed surfaces , while on nickel we have found that when the reconstruction takes place carbon and nitrogen atoms become almost coplanar with the substrate ones , thus becoming essentially five - fold coordinated .",
    "the carbon atoms penetrate into the nickel substrate even at zero temperature , and they arrange themselves so as to be almost coplanar with the first nickel layer ; the nitrogen atoms behave similarly , but a barrier is found to exist which gives rise to a meta - stable equilibrium structure in which the ad - atoms do not penetrate and the surface does not reconstruct .",
    "these facts indicate that the mechanism of the reconstruction is related with the atomic penetration into the first surface layer : the sites which accommodate the ad - atoms tend to enlarge , and this results necessarily in a rhomboid distortion of the empty sites .",
    "this distortion has a cost in term of elastic energy .",
    "we argue that the surface reconstructs when the chemical effects are larger than the elastic effects . upon c or n adsorption , the ni(001 )",
    "surface reconstructs , while rh(001 ) does not .",
    "the reason is probably the different stiffness of the two metals : rhodium has larger elastic constants and thus it does not reconstruct . in the case of the oxygen",
    "the mechanism of the reconstruction is completely different , being due to the o  rh re - bonding , and results in a different reconstruction pattern .",
    "we are grateful to renzo rosei for inspiring this work and for making the results of ref .",
    "@xcite available to us prior to publication .",
