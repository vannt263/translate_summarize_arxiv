    "the purpose of any scattering experiment is to learn something about the dynamics of the total system consisting of projectile and target in situations , where the direct observation of the dynamics of this total system is not possible or difficult .",
    "then we need to evaluate the asymptotic scattering data to gain this desired insight .",
    "thereby we are lead to the inverse scattering problem .",
    "traditionally this expression is used for the reconstruction of the potential or of the hamiltonian . for chaotic systems , however , the reconstruction of other quantities like for example characteristics of the chaotic saddle or chaotic invariant set might also be worth while and more realistic @xcite . even if possible , reconstructing the potential first and using it to reconstruct the dynamics and then investigating this reconstructed dynamics to get the information on the chaotic saddle includes a lot of sources for errors and ambiguities .",
    "therefore it is attractive to develop strategies to extract the properties of the chaotic saddle directly from the scattering data . in this spirit",
    "the most complete information would be the reconstruction of the complete knowledge of all properties of the chaotic saddle of the system directly from asymptotic measurements .",
    "for system of two degrees of freedom ( including time - dependent systems with one degree of freedom ) this chaotic set might be represented by a horseshoe @xcite construction of an iterated map , typically on a surface of section appropriately chosen .",
    "the inverse problem turns into the problem of reconstructing the properties of this horseshoe from the knowledge of scattering data .",
    "first steps in this direction have been taken in @xcite for kicked systems in one dimension as well as for systems with one open degree of freedom and one closed vibrational degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "an independent alternative has been presented in @xcite .",
    "all this work is based on the evaluation of the fractal structure of scattering functions where the hardest problem is the recognition of the hierarchical level of all intervals of continuity .",
    "once we have done this step we can reconstruct the branching tree of the underlying fractal , measure all its scaling factors and apply the thermodynamical methods @xcite to extract quantitative measures of chaos .",
    "for the measurement of these scattering functions the simultaneous preparation and measurement of canonically conjugate variables is necessary . therefore all these methods are essentially classical and might at best work in the deep semi - classical domain of wave mechanics .",
    "in addition these methods are useful only for complete or near - complete horseshoes .",
    "in contrast in the present paper we present a completely different idea which is based on the self - pulsing effect of chaotic scattering systems with horseshoes of a low development stage . the present method has the pleasant property that it does not require the simultaneous measurement of conjugate variables .",
    "therefore it works similarly in classical and in quantum dynamics .",
    "the only important difference between the classical and the wave versions is , that due to tunneling in wave mechanics the interior of kam islands is also explored , which is inaccessible to asymptotic observation in the classical case . for our argument",
    "it is essential that the system can be described by an iterated map on a two - dimensional domain .",
    "this implies the same restriction to two dimensions , that we encountered in previous work@xcite .",
    "preliminary results along for the line of argument we shall present were given in a letter @xcite for kicked systems .",
    "at present experiments are in progress in darmstadt @xcite applying our idea to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an open superconducting cavity that can be viewed as an open two - dimensional billiard .",
    "we shall present both kicked systems for their simplicity and scattering billiards because of the ongoing experiments and because of their relevance for mesoscopic structures .",
    "the surface of section will be a stroboscopic map in the first case and a birkoff map in the second one .",
    "we shall concentrate on geometries that lead to low order horseshoes , in fact limiting our considerations to second and third order , though the basic idea is not subject to such a limitation .",
    "furthermore we shall make extensive use of the parametrization of the development of a horseshoe as given in @xcite , and we shall only be concerned by degrees of development considerably smaller than one half , which insures , that a large stable island around the inner fixed point still exists .",
    "we shall show , that this island with its characteristic fractal surroundings rotate at a rate defined by the formal development parameter of the horseshoe .",
    "this gives rise to the suspicion , that this time of revolution can be measured by studying pulsed reverberance of the scattering system , which we name scattering echoes ( to distinguish them from loschmidt echoes ) .",
    "numerical simulation shows , that it should be possible to measure such echoes .    in the next section we shall proceed to discuss the way such echoes may occur , and in the third section we derive the formulae for the relation between formal development parameters of the horseshoe and the period of the echoes .",
    "we then proceed to discuss examples leading to binary and ternary horseshoes . for kicked systems",
    "we discuss both the classical and wave - mechanical part , while we limit ourselves to a classical discussion of scattering billiards , as these present a fine example where reliable calculations are extremely expensive , and will not be able to replace the experiment in the microwave cavity .",
    "we will then draw some conclusions and give an outlook .",
    "in this section , we shall demonstrate the appearance of echoes in the scattering of any typical two degrees of freedom hamiltonian scattering system described by a binary or ternary horseshoe with a low degree of development , _ i. e. _ with a large central stable island .",
    "we first consider a scattering system whose chaotic saddle is described in some appropriate poincar map by a binary horseshoe , i.e. one having two fixed points .",
    "one of the fixed points is normal hyperbolic for any set of values of the physical parameters of the system .",
    "it couples the complicated dynamics inside the interaction region with the regular dynamics in the asymptotic region . for this reason , this unstable fixed point",
    "is usually called the _ exterior fixed point_. its invariant manifolds trace out the horseshoe , from whose topological structure at least an approximate symbolic dynamics can be obtained @xcite .",
    "this forms the core of the method presented in this paper .",
    "the intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds of the horseshoe form the so - called homoclinic tangle .",
    "the fractal and hierarchical arrangement of the homoclinic intersections are responsible for the chaotic motion inside the scattering region and surrounds the second fixed point of the poincar map , thus called the _ inner fixed point_. contrary to the exterior fixed point , the stability of the inner fixed point depends on the values of physical parameters of the system . for typical systems , the poincar map shows a complete kam scenario : first the inner fixed point is stable , surrounded by kam surfaces .",
    "eventually , those kam surfaces break into chains of secondary islands and chaotic layers which for higher levels of development fuse into one large homoclinic tangle .",
    "for some values of the parameters , the inner fixed point changes its stability through a period - doubling bifurcation .    for the method presented here",
    "the existence of an inner stable island is essential and therefore , we shall focus on a region in the parameter space for which the inner fixed point is stable and surrounded by a large primary island of stability with the generic region of secondary stable islands and chaos surrounding it . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sos-2 ] we show a schematic representation of the structure of the poincar map of a generic system in the situation just described .",
    "the exterior fixed point is represented by a cross and its unstable dynamics in its vicinity is indicated by the red arrows .",
    "the homoclinic tangle of the exterior fixed point surrounds the stable island . beyond the last kam surface of the primary island the non - trivial scattering trajectories traverse what we may call",
    "chaotic scattering layer_.    the scattering layer extends to infinity , covering the whole domain of the map outside of the last kam surface .",
    "however , the part of the scattering layer of interest for the scattering process corresponds to the one whose energy domain in the asymptotic region coincides with the energy domain for which the singular structure in scattering functions appear .",
    "this chaotic scattering layer is actually the region of the homoclinic tangle represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sos-2 ] , as the gray ring around the stable island .",
    "the gray strips that extend to infinity correspond to region in which the incoming and outgoing trajectories enter or leave the chaotic scattering layer and are the region over which the infinity of tendrils of the stable and unstable manifolds of the outer fixed point are spread .",
    "the incoming trajectories not belonging to this gray layer will either bounce back to the asymptotic region immediately or travel around the stable island without entering into the chaotic scattering layer .",
    "those trajectories will be scattered in what are usually called direct processes .",
    "schematic representation of the generic surface of section for a scattering system described by a binary horseshoe .",
    "the green arrow lines represent the flow of the trajectories over the surface of section . ]",
    "let us describe the scattering process as viewed on the poincar surface of section sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sos-2 ] .",
    "we focus on incoming scattering trajectories that start close to the stable manifold . when these trajectories enter the chaotic scattering layer they rotate around the stable island .",
    "this rotation is characterized by the winding number of the outermost kam surface .",
    "its effects are felt over the full scattering layer and as we shall show in the next section , it can be directly related to the topology of the underlying chaotic saddle .    as is well known @xcite , in their rotation around the island the trajectories always return to the vicinity of the exterior fixed point .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , after one revolution some of the trajectories will leave the homoclinic tangle along the unstable manifold .",
    "the rest will continue in their rotation to complete a second revolution around the island .",
    "when the remaining trajectories return to the vicinity of the exterior fixed point , part of them will in turn exit the chaotic scattering layer to the asymptotic region . this process will continue _",
    "ad infinitum_.    the key observation is the following : any trajectory starting close to the stable manifold will leave the chaotic scattering layer after an integer number of revolutions around the stable island . as a result ,",
    "if we measure the asymptotic outgoing flux resulting from a narrow packet of incoming trajectories , we shall observe that the flux intensity oscillates in time .",
    "clearly , the time between two successive maxima of the outgoing flux will correspond to the period of time a typical trajectory in the scattering layer needs to complete a rotation around the island or equivalently , to the return time to the neighbourhood of the exterior fixed point .",
    "the minimal return time corresponds to the trajectories close to the surface of the island which is most sticky and thereby , determines the time between the observed outgoing pulses , _ i.e. _ the scattering echoes . in a typical situation",
    "the return times of the trajectories in the chaotic scattering layer increase monotonously with the distance from the center of the stable island .",
    "therefore , the time between successive echoes will be determined by the mean orbital period of rotation of the trajectories rotating close to the surface of the island .",
    "the width of the echoes in the outgoing flux will be related to the intrinsic dispersion of the packet of incoming trajectories in the chaotic scattering layer .",
    "thus , the appearance of scattering echoes is typical for @xmath0-dimensional hamiltonian scattering systems , where the chaotic invariant set is represented by a horseshoe of low development stage .",
    "schematic representation of the generic surface of section for a scattering system described by a ternary horseshoe . ]    hamiltonian scattering systems in which the poincar map possesses 3 fixed points can be described by a ternary horseshoes .",
    "we concentrate on cases where there exist two exterior normal hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "this implies the existence of two fractal bundles of tendrils of stable manifolds along which trajectories can enter the chaotic layer and another two fractal consisting of unstable manifolds for the exit .",
    "we shall continue to call the tangle formed by the intersections of the invariant manifolds of the two exterior fixed points `` homoclinic tangle '' , though it clearly contains both homoclinic and heteroclinic intersections .",
    "it surrounds the inner fixed point whose stability is determined by the physical parameters of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sos-3 ] we show a schematic representation of the structure of the poincar map of a generic system described by a symmetric ternary horseshoe . in the region of parameter space where the inner fixed point gives rise to a well developed island of stability surrounded by a chaotic scattering layer , it is possible to follow the same line of argumentation as above .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the existence of scattering echoes remains generic .",
    "the time between echoes is again given by the return time in the chaotic scattering layer to the given exterior fixed point .",
    "the main difference with the binary case is that for the symmetric ternary case there are two outgoing manifolds near to which the self - pulsing can be measured .",
    "if we perform such an experiment with a narrow packet of incoming trajectories from one side the scattering echoes shall appear in both outgoing manifolds in counter - phase .    on the quantum level",
    "we expect to see the same scattering echoes . actually , we find that the echoes are more clean - cut in the quantum regime , and we shall see that this is due to tunneling . while forbidden for classical trajectories the quantum probability can penetrate kam surfaces and settle on inner regions of the classical island . therefore",
    ", if the quantum probability rotates around the island at a smaller distance from the center , the period of the quantum echoes will systematically differ from the classical one .",
    "the quantum probability will feel the winding number of inner kam surfaces and send this information out through the scattering echoes .",
    "this phenomenon is interesting by itself . by measuring the period of",
    "the quantum echoes we are able to probe regions in phase space that are inaccessible to classical scattering and obtain information about the topology of the classical chaotic saddle by controlling the limit @xmath1 .",
    "the central point of the method developed in this paper is the connection between the period of the scattering echoes and the development stage of the horseshoe .",
    "as has been discussed in the previous section , this time corresponds to the inverse of the mean winding number or orbital period in the chaotic scattering layer .",
    "thus the period of the scattering echoes is given in units of the mean return time to the surface of section . to unravel its connection with the topology of the underlying chaotic invariant set",
    "we shall use the formal development parameter @xmath2 as a measure of the development of the horseshoe .",
    "it measures the penetration depth of the tendrils into the interior of the fundamental area of the horseshoe and therefore contains the information on the primary homoclinic intersections .",
    "this tells us the universal aspects of the topology of the hyperbolic component of the horseshoe .",
    "the parameter takes values from @xmath3 corresponding to a separatrix loop , to @xmath4 when the horseshoe becomes complete . for a detailed definition of the development parameter and a discussion of the development stages of incomplete horseshoes as well as for the terminology we use ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the relation of the development parameter @xmath2 to the winding number in the chaotic scattering layer is most easily established if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the order of the horseshoe . thus , without loss of generality , we shall stick to this case and then invoke continuity arguments to close the gaps .    before continuing with the description of the method , there are some properties of the horseshoe construction , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] , we would like to point out :    1 .",
    "the horseshoe construction is created by the intricate intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds of the exterior fixed points .",
    "the horseshoe exists in a surface of section and its outer unstable part forms the chaotic scattering layer .",
    "the invariant manifolds of the exterior fixed points never enter any kam island .",
    "any point on the unstable invariant manifold converges to the exterior fixed point as time @xmath7 .",
    "any point on the stable invariant manifold converges to the exterior fixed point as time @xmath8 .",
    "the labeling of the different tendrils of the horseshoe is quite convenient as due to the invariance of the manifolds , each tendril is the image and the pre - image of other tendrils under the poincar map . for the unstable manifold tendril @xmath9 is the image of @xmath10 . for the stable manifold tendril @xmath9",
    "is the image of @xmath11 .    in what follows",
    "we shall stick to the binary horseshoe case and briefly discuss at the end the modifications of the method for the ternary case . by definition , if for a binary horseshoe @xmath12 , the first tendril of one of the invariant manifolds is intersected by the tip of the @xmath9-th tendril of the other one in two points only .",
    "we label the different tendrils starting from the so - called primary intersection indicated by the letter @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] .",
    "there we show schematically the topology corresponding to an incomplete horseshoe with @xmath14",
    ". thus , tendril @xmath4 of the unstable invariant manifold ( shown in red ) is intersected by the tip of the @xmath15-th tendril of the stable manifold ( in green ) in two points .",
    "topology of a horseshoe for @xmath16 .",
    "the point @xmath17 is the exterior fixed point .",
    "its invariant manifolds the unstable in red and stable in green , first intersect in the primary intersection point @xmath18 .",
    "the successive tendrils are labeled starting from @xmath18 .",
    "the tendrils of the stable manifold have been emphasized in black . ]    in fig .  [",
    "fig : method ] , we have emphasized the tendrils of the stable manifold in black . from property ( iii )",
    "the tendril @xmath4 of the stable manifold is the image of tendril @xmath0 and pre - image of tendril @xmath3 .",

    "ad infinitum_. due to this hierarchy , an intersection between tendril @xmath9 of the unstable manifold and tendril @xmath21 of the stable manifold labeled by @xmath22 is the image of the intersection @xmath23 and pre - image of @xmath24 .",

    "[ fig : method ] ) , after one iteration of the poincar map it will be in the vicinity of the unstable tendril @xmath0 . after a second iteration , the trajectory will be near the unstable tendril @xmath19 and so on . _ a priori _ , we do not know which of the unstable tendrils will be again in the vicinity of the unstable tendril @xmath4 , but we do know that this trajectory will have almost completed a revolution around the inner stable island when it reaches the vicinity of the stable tendril @xmath20 , and a little bit more than one revolution when it reaches the vicinity of the stable tendril @xmath25 .",
    "a development @xmath12 implies an intersection @xmath26 . since the stable tendril @xmath20 is the ( @xmath27)-th image of the stable tendril @xmath9 , the unstable tendril which intersects the stable tendril @xmath20 is the ( @xmath28)-th .",
    "thus , if the trajectory was started in the vicinity of the unstable tendril @xmath4 , and since the unstable tendril @xmath28 is the ( @xmath27)-th image of @xmath4 , this trajectory will have almost completed a revolution in @xmath27 iterations of the poincar map .",
    "equivalently , this trajectory will have completed a little bit more than one revolution after @xmath28 iterations of the poincar map .",
    "concerning our interest in the average behaviour of the trajectories close to the surface of the island , we have obtained the following : if the development of the underlying horseshoe is @xmath12 , the orbital period of the scattering trajectories is approximately @xmath29 and we cast this result into the form @xmath30    the mean period @xmath31 in eq .",
    "[ eq : magic_2 ] is given in units of the return time to the surface of section @xmath32 which corresponds to the time spend in one iteration of the poincar map .",
    "for time periodic systems , the poincar map is the stroboscopic map and thus , the return time to the surface of the section is constant . for systems which are not periodic in time",
    ", the units of @xmath31 can be taken as the mean return time to the surface of section in the chaotic scattering layer .",
    "the development of the horseshoe , related to the dynamics of the system , does not depend on the surface of section we select .",
    "this is tantamount to the fact that the mean @xmath32 does not depend on the surface we choose .    in the derivation of eq .",
    "[ eq : magic_2 ] we have not used any particular model . therefore , this relation between the mean orbital period and the topology of the hyperbolic component of the horseshoe given in terms of the development parameter @xmath2 is universal for hamiltonian scattering systems described by a binary horseshoe .",

    "[ eq : magic_2 ] we obtain @xmath33 however , since @xmath2 is given in terms of the revolutions of the scattering trajectories around the stable island , the application of eqs .",
    "[ eq : magic_2 ] and [ eq : inv_magic_2 ] is limited to the situation where a central stable island actually exist .",
    "this condition is formally fulfilled for @xmath34 @xcite , but practically this method is probably limited to cases in which the horseshoe is in a stage of low development say with @xmath35 or smaller .    for the case of hamiltonian scattering systems described by a symmetric ternary horseshoe , following the same arguments as for the binary case , the formal development parameter ( called @xmath36 to distinguish it from the binary case )",
    "is related with the orbital period by @xmath37 in eq .",
    "[ eq : inv_magic_3 ] , the base @xmath19 comes from the fact that the horseshoe is ternary and the @xmath38 in the exponent is due to the existence of two exterior fixed points .",
    "in this section we shall consider both binary and symmetric ternary situations in detail using kicked one - dimensional systems and open two - dimensional billiards as examples . on one hand we shall concentrate on a billiard that gives rise to a binary horseshoe , while another one corresponding to a ternary horseshoe will be presented in the context of a superconducting experimental realization performed presently at darmstadt @xcite . on the other hand we shall study in detail a kicked system that gives rise to a ternary horseshoe giving considerably more detail than in the short discussion of the binary horseshoe in ref .",
    "@xcite . for kicked systems",
    "classical and quantum dynamics are easily solved numerically . for billiards",
    "the classical analysis is simple , while the numerical analysis of the wave equation in scattering situations is more delicate , and little previous work has been done .",
    "here we shall limit our analysis of such systems to the classical case and leave the study of wave mechanics to the experimental analysis .      in this section we shall study the classical echoes that appear in the scattering of a classical open elastic billiard .",
    "for this we could think of using the well known three discs problem @xcite , but this system has serious disadvantages ; the principal one is that the low development degree of the horseshoe , that we desire can not be reached . while the shadowing of orbits from one disc to the next will lead to incomplete horseshoe scenarios due to pruning",
    ", stable islands do not develop .",
    "this can be intuitively understood from the fact that even when the circles osculate such islands are absent @xcite , and a numerical analysis confirms that the horseshoes we need are not obtainable .",
    "we therefore look for a bottle shaped billiard with a single opening .",
    "its boundary consist in an arc of ellipse to the left ( bottom of the bottle ) and a quartic polynomial curve properly connected ( for the neck of the bottle ) . for practical purposes we use only half the bottle split along its length .",

    "the bottle has two fundamental periodic orbits corresponding to trajectories , which are normal to both the upper and lower boundaries .",

    "[ fig : k - t - long - pulses ] , the position of this `` classical '' resonance is a distance of @xmath156 from the last resonance , thus confirming the association of the period of the quantum echoes to the energy separation between the last resonances .",
    "fourier transform of the quantum outgoing flux @xmath64 for the model system of eq .",
    "[ eq : k - t - potential ] for @xmath117 .",
    "the spectra correspond to initial wave packets with different incoming momenta , from bottom to top : @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the rest of the parameters are @xmath146 , @xmath97 and @xmath96 . in the inset",
    "we plot the first group of resonances appearing in @xmath157 , calculated at @xmath169 .",
    "the first resonance at @xmath170 corresponds to the classical resonance . ]",
    "we want to call attention to the possibility to apply quantum scattering echoes as a tool to explore the dynamics in the interior of the island inaccessible to classical scattering trajectories . for the model system eq .",
    "[ eq : k - t - potential ] we have performed the following numerical experiment : as before , we target the potential well with a short pulse @xmath171 with initial incoming momentum @xmath143 and measure the outgoing quantum flux @xmath64 as a function of time . applying a fourier transformation to @xmath64 we obtain its frequency spectrum @xmath172 .",
    "as @xmath64 corresponds to the decay of the quantum probability that stays rotating around the stable island its fourier spectrum simply tell us the frequency at which the quantum probability rotates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : beating ] we show @xmath172 for five initial wave packets with different incoming momenta .",
    "what we observe is that the probability trapped in the potential well , rotates with a period which depends on the incoming momentum of the packet . comparing the five spectra",
    "it is clear that the excited frequencies correspond to those of the quasibound states of the system .",
    "indeed this is the case as it is confirmed in the inset of the same figure where the resonance spectrum of @xmath173 as a function of the incoming momentum is shown .",
    "therefore , by measuring the period of the quantum echoes obtained from an incident packet that scans the incoming energy we can produce a map of the characteristic winding numbers in the interior of the island . in a sense , wave mechanics may be used as an `` x - ray device '' to study regions inaccessible in classical mechanics . under certain circumstances",
    "this may be a way to solve the problem of finding the return time to the classical surface of section we encountered above , because the differential rotation time will converge to the period of the inner periodic orbit , which has the value @xmath174 which we used successfully to approximate this time .",
    "similar results could be obtained by fourier transform of results in the energy domain , as touched upon in the conclusions .",
    "classical horseshoe and phase portrait for the knee billiard for @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the development of the horseshoe is @xmath178 .",
    "the shape of the billiard is shown at the top right of the figure where the dashed lines correspond to the unstable periodic orbits . ]    as a final example we briefly comment the classical scattering in a billiard giving rise to a symmetric ternary horseshoe .",
    "a study of this particular example and its experimental realization will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the billiard in question consist of two boundaries : a gaussian and a parabola given by @xmath179 both boundaries extend from @xmath180 to @xmath181 .",
    "the shape of this billiard is shown inside fig .",
    "[ fig : knee - horseshoe ] for some set of its parameters .",
    "this billiard has three fundamental periodic orbits , one in each neck and one in the center .",
    "the stability of the inner periodic orbit corresponding to a vertical trajectory at @xmath45 , depends on the values for the local curvature of the boundaries .",
    "the other two periodic orbits , indicated in the figure as dashed lines are unstable for any set of the billiard s parameters and thus , give rise to a symmetric ternary horseshoe . in fig .",
    "[ fig : knee - horseshoe ] we show this ternary horseshoe superimposed to the scattering layer given in birkhoff coordinates over the lower ( parabolic ) boundary .",
    "the phase portrait of this billiard shows a generic structure with an underlying ternary horseshoe .",
    "therefore , the appearance of echoes is guaranteed .",
    "again we have obtained the outgoing flux of classical trajectories as a function of time @xmath64 , measured at symmetric positions in the asymptotic region .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : knee - echoes ] in which the scattering echoes are evident . as before , the echoes emitted to the left",
    "are in counter phase with those emitted to the right .",
    "outgoing flux of classical trajectories as a function of time for the knee billiard , measured at @xmath138 ( blue ) and @xmath139 ( green ) . ]",
    "in a soft chaos scattering situation , where a large central island exists , we find a self - pulsing effect , which we call scattering echoes .",
    "they can be measured experimentally , and can be used to make significant progress in the inverse scattering problem for such situations .",
    "we understand the inverse scattering problem as the task to reconstruct information about the chaotic invariant set from asymptotic data .",
    "the approach presented is new in two aspects .",
    "first , it handles little developed horseshoes where a homoclinic tangle encircles a large kam island .",
    "second , to our knowledge it is the first method for the inverse chaotic scattering problem which works for classical and quantum ( wave ) dynamics along the same idea .",
    "we concentrate on systems described by binary and ternary symmetric horseshoes in a two dimensional poincar map .",
    "the generalization to asymmetric ternary horseshoes is simple and we have mentioned the essential equation for this case in eq .",
    "[ eq : magic_3as ] .",
    "more complicated generalizations would be necessary for billiards with more than two openings .",
    "such systems can serve as models for rearrangement scattering where each opening represents one arrangement channel .",
    "the corresponding poincar map has a more complicated domain of several connected components which can lead to horseshoes of essentially complex structure .",
    "the treatment of the inverse problem for such systems remains an interesting open question .",
    "another nontrivial generalization is the transition to systems with more than two important degrees of freedom . yet",
    "the theory of chaotic scattering in higher dimensions is incipient @xcite .",
    "the test of our ideas in laboratory experiments is in progress for the transmission of electromagnetic waves through open cavities @xcite .",
    "such experiments are typically done in the frequency domain , but if we use fourier transforms to pass to the time domain , the following fascinating possibility exists : we measure a very long sequence of echoes .",
    "the first ones correspond to components of the wave , which only visit the outer regions of the homoclinic tangle .",
    "after longer time we measure components , which tunneled into the outer regions of the stable island . signals leaving after ever longer times correspond to tunneling deep into the kam island . accordingly",
    "the change of the distances between adjacent echoes during the measurement reflects the differential rotation of the various layers inside of the island . in this type of measurement",
    "the absorption which exists in any real experiment will set a limit to the maximal time ( depth of penetration into the island ) which can be reached .",
    "the problem of absorption might be circumvented by placing antennae into the interior of the interaction region .",
    "of course , then the experiment is no longer a pure scattering experiment , and it would no longer be a testing ground for ideas for solving the inverse problem . however , it might be a worthwhile experiment for the analysis of tunneling of waves out of kam islands",
    ". the only problem could be the distortion of the horseshoe dynamics by the presence of the antenna .",
    "while microwave billiards present an obvious testing ground for our results , we expect , that scattering echoes of the type we discussed , will appear in other experiments in atomic and molecular physics , and that situations similar to the billiards can be set up in mesoscopics and for atoms in laser fields .",
