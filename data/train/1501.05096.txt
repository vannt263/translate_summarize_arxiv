    "the basic unit of quantum information is a two - level quantum system commonly known as a qubit .",
    "qubits can be implemented on physical objects such as polarisation of photons or intrinsic angular momentum ( spin @xmath0 ) of quantum particles .",
    "any quantum computation relies on precise preparations , transformations and measurements of such systems . before actual quantum computer is build , one has to master the ability to manipulate with single qubits and learn how to readout information encoded in them .",
    "the information readout from a quantum system is done via a measurement . in most common scenario one",
    "performs the von neumann measurement that projects a state of the qubit onto one of two perfectly distinguishable ( orthogonal ) physical states of the system .",
    "such measurements are sharp in a sense that once the measurement is done , the outcome of the measurement is determined and any repetition of exactly the same measurement would yield the same outcome value .",
    "physically , von neumann measurements are realised via interaction of the system with the measurement apparatus .",
    "the pointer of the measurement apparatus is represented via wave packed and the interaction causes this wave packet to move either to the left or right , depending on the value of the measured observable . in general , this value might be undetermined and the pointer goes into superposition of being to the left and to the right from its initial position .",
    "the actual collapse of wave function is usually attributed to the observer who reads out the measurement outcome from the pointer .",
    "the sharpness of the measurement comes from the fact that the initial spread of the pointer s state is assumed to be narrow and the translation caused by the interaction with the measured observable is large enough to prevent overlap between the part of the wave packed that was shifted to the right with the part that was shifted to the left .    on the other hand , there are generalised measurement scenarios , the so called positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) , in which one allows the principal system to interact with an ancillary system , whose state is known , and later performs a von neumann measurement on the joint system",
    "this effectively extends the dimensionality of the hilbert space and one can implement measurements of a quibit with more than two outcomes . as a result ,",
    "one gains a plethora of new possibilities .",
    "they allow one , for example , to perform a tomography of qubit with a single measurement setup @xcite , or to discriminate between non - orthogonal quantum states @xcite .",
    "povms were implemented in laboratories using various setups @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that they can be implemented via a discrete - time quantum walk which has been realised in a laboratory using various physical systems @xcite .",
    "quantum walks model an evolution of a particle in a discrete space .",
    "the particle moves either one step to the left or right , depending on a state of a two - level system known as a coin .",
    "quantum walks were originally proposed as an interference process resulting from a modified version of a von neumann measurement in which a pointer state distribution is much broader than the shift of its position @xcite .",
    "the position of the pointer plays the role of the quantum walker and the qubit that is measured plays the role of the coin .",
    "if the interaction between the pointer and the qubit occurs at the same time as the evolution of the qubit , the measured value changes during the process and the pointer starts to move back and forth .",
    "this movement leads to an interference and the interference pattern produced in this process can be interpreted as a povm .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that any povm can be implemented in such a way , provided a necessary evolution is applied to the qubit .    in this work",
    "we report an experimental implementation of the above quantum walk povm scenario . here",
    ", we use the optical setup in which the qubit is encoded in a polarization state of a single photon and the position of the quantum walker is implemented on a photonic path @xcite .",
    "we construct setups realising ( i ) three povm elements symmetrically distributed on an equatorial plane of the bloch sphere ( trine - povm ) ; ( ii ) symmetric - informationally - complete ( sic ) povm ; and ( iii ) unambiguous discrimination of two non - orthogonal quantum states .",
    "discrete - time quantum walks are quantum counterparts of classical random walks in which a particle takes a random step to the left or right . in the classical case",
    "the particle spreads in a diffusive manner ( a standard deviation of its position is proportional to @xmath1 ) and after many steps a spatial probability distribution is gaussian . in quantum case the system is described by two degrees of freedom @xmath2 : the position @xmath3 and a two - level internal degree of freedom known as a coin @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution is unitary and consists of two sub - operations @xmath5 , namely a unitary coin toss ( that is a @xmath6 unitary matrix acting only on the coin degree of freedom ) @xmath7 and a conditional translation operation @xmath8    quantum walks with uniform ( position - independent ) coin operation spread ballistically ( standard deviation proportional to @xmath9 ) and its probability distribution differs form the classical gaussian shape @xcite . on the other hand , quantum walks with position - dependent coin operation @xmath10 can be used to observe localisation @xcite , or to simulate physical systems with non - homogenous interactions @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that quantum walks with position and time - dependent coin operations @xmath11 can be also used to implement povms .",
    "the probability distribution of a quantum walk , that is initially localised at the origin @xmath12 , depends on the initial coin state @xmath13 and on the subsequent coin operations .",
    "a single application of the operator @xmath14 makes the particle to go into superposition @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the position measurement would correspond to a von neumann measurement of the coin in the basis @xmath16 , where the result @xmath17 corresponds to finding the particle at @xmath18 and @xmath19 to finding it at @xmath20 .",
    "however , if one allows quantum walk to evolve for more than one step and the coin operation to change from one step to another step , then the particle can spread over many positions and the measurement of its location at @xmath21 may correspond to a measurement of some povm element @xmath22 . indeed , a proper choice of coin operations can lead to an arbitrary qubit povm scenario @xcite .",
    "the povm elements @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are nonnegative operators obeying @xmath25 they differ from standard von neumann projectors @xmath26 in that they do not have to be orthonormal ( @xmath27 , but @xmath28 ) and that their number can be greater than the dimension of the system @xmath29 .",
    "the following quantum walk algorithm , proposed in @xcite , generates an arbitrary set of rank 1 povm elements @xmath30 ( rank 2 elements can be generated with a modified version of this algorithm ) .    1 .",
    "initiate the quantum walk at position @xmath12 with the coin state corresponding to the qubit state one wants to measure .",
    "2 .   set @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   while @xmath32 do the following : * apply coin operation @xmath33 at position @xmath34 and identity elsewhere and then apply translation operator @xmath14 . *",
    "apply coin operation @xmath35 at position @xmath36 , @xmath37 at position @xmath38 and identity elsewhere and then apply translation operator @xmath14 .",
    "* @xmath39 .",
    "since in this work we are only interested in the measurement statistics , and not in the post - measurement states , we simplified the algorithm in @xcite and omitted the last step .",
    "the povm elements that are generated depend solely on the form of operators @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
