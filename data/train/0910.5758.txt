    "we have found that , at sufficiently small collisional velocities is imprinted to each vortex by multiplying its corresponding steady state by @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",

    "[ collision_series ] we show the collision of vortices carrying charges @xmath73 and @xmath6 , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that , since the vortex with @xmath73 has opposite phase on the collision side , with respect to the vortex with @xmath6 , the interaction is repulsive since it locally emulates the interaction of two out - of - phase fundamental bright solitons @xcite . therefore , if the velocity is small enough , the mutual repulsion determines the result of the collision . on the other hand , when the vortex with charge @xmath73 is phase - shifted by @xmath81 ( or similarly , if the charge @xmath73 vortex were to be placed on the opposite side of the charge @xmath6 vortex ) , the adjacent sides of the colliding vortices are in phase .",
    "therefore , the interaction is similar to that between two in - phase bright solitons , which is _ attractive _ interaction , adhikari03 .",
    "this results in the merger of the two vortices and their eventual breakup into fragments .                                                    clearly , even when the repulsive force acts between vortices , but the collision velocity is sufficiently large , the vortices have enough momentum for causing them to merge and eventually break up as well .",

    "[ collision_series ] . in this panel",
    "we depict a  billiard \"- type example , in which one vortex collides with another , which in turn collides with a third one .",
    "all collisions in this case are elastic because the relative phases have been chosen such that the colliding sides are always out - of - phase , providing for the necessary repulsion .",
    "it is worthy to note that , although these collisions at low velocities seem to be elastic , the stable vortices clearly have internal breathing modes , that are excited during the collisions . therefore",
    ", a small fraction of the collisional energy is transferred to these internal modes , preventing the collisions from being completely elastic .",
    "a more in - depth analysis of the excitation of these internal modes and of the degree of the inelasticity of the collisions fall outside of the scope of the present work . nonetheless , in order to quantify the degree of the elasticity of the collisions , we have measured the critical velocity @xmath82 for the vortices to elastically bounce off each other : at @xmath83 the vortices bounce elastically , while at @xmath84 they merge and , most often , get destroyed .",
    "the crucial parameter that controls @xmath82 , for a particular combination of the charges of colliding vortices , is their phase difference @xmath85@xmath86 .",
    "different values of @xmath74  allow to have different relative phases at the colliding sides ( as discussed above ) , and thus ( partially ) repel or attract .",

    "finally , in panel ( c ) we present the results for two vortices with @xmath98 .",
    "the behavior is very similar to that in panel ( b ) : the same periodicity , shape and value of the optimal phase difference .",
    "however , since the vortices with @xmath73 vortices are less stable than those with @xmath6 , the critical velocity @xmath82 is lower for the @xmath90 charge combination than for the case of @xmath94 .    in order to fully characterize the collisions between vortices with different charges , we studied the scattering of a vortex of charge @xmath99 impinging at velocity @xmath100 upon another vortex of charge @xmath101 at rest ( @xmath102 ) , with impact parameter @xmath103 .",

    "we use a square domain of size @xmath136 with periodic boundary conditions , seeding 15 vortices of charge @xmath6 at random positions ( such that initially no two vortices were closer than twice the size of a single vortex ) , and with random phases . as seen from the figure , due to the random phase differences and collision angles , some vortex pairs experience elastic collisions , while others tend to merge and destroy each other .",
    "since the destruction of vortices is an irreversible process , all the vortices get eventually destroyed , leading to a seemingly disordered pattern of interacting intensity patches with an approximately constant phase inside each one ( see the correspondence between field patches in the top rows and the phase patches in the bottom rows , at the late stage of the evolution ) .",
    "the dynamics resembles the grain coarsening in typical chaotic spatiotemporal systems , see e.g. , review @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have revisited the issues of the existence , stability , and interactions of solitary vortices in the two - dimensional cqnls ( cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger ) equation , using both numerical and analytical methods .",
    "the latter one is based on the variational approach , that has been shown to be increasingly more accurate as the vortex topological charge increases .",
    "we have also developed the analysis of the azimuthal modulational ( in)stability of vortices , using the approximation originally proposed in other contexts in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which postulates the separation between the frozen radial profile of the vortex soliton and free evolution of azimuthal perturbations .",
    "this approach leads to an effectively one - dimensional equation for the azimuthal dynamics . examining the stability of the perturbed annulus within the framework of the latter equation , we were able to predict the stability of the vortices against the breakup .",
    "we then ran full 2d simulations to verify the semi - analytical predictions .    for azimuthally unstable vortices , our predictions of the largest growth rate",
    "are fairly accurate over a wide range of the vortex intrinsic frequency ( especially for the higher - order vortices , with topological charge @xmath137 )",
    ". the so developed semi - analytical technique may be useful for other applications .",
    "the analytical approach is less accurate in predicting the stability border ( intrinsic critical frequency of the vortex ) for @xmath138 .",
    "this discrepancy is due to deviation from the assumption admitting the separation of the perturbed evolution into radial and azimuthal parts , while the va proper , which was used to predict the radial shape of the stationary vortex solitons turns out to yield accurate results . comparing our numerical results for the critical frequency with previously published ones ,",
    "we have concluded that the most accurate findings were reported in ref .",
    "we have also found that higher - order vortices may be subject to a snaking radial instability .",
    "the semi - analytical approach developed in this work may be quite useful for other 2d models at least , for the description of the most stable vortex solitons with lowest values of the topological charge .",
    "we have also investigated , in detail , collisions between stable vortex solitons in the two - dimensional cqnls equation .",
    "the outcome of the collision crucially depends on the phase difference and relative velocity of the vortices .",
    "we have produced the results showing the critical velocity for elastic collisions as a function of the relative phase for all combinations of the vortices with @xmath6 and @xmath139 .",
    "we also studied the dependence on the scattering angles and post - collision velocities on the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "one relevant direction for the extension of the present analysis is to find accurate conditions for the stabilization of the nearly isotropic vortex solitons by an external spatially periodic ( lattice ) potential , see ref .",
    "sakaguchi and references therein .",
    "a challenging problem is to extend the semi - analytical considerations to _ three - dimensional _ solitons with embedded vorticity , in the model with the same cubic - quintic nonlinearity .",
    "in fact , it is not known if such 3d vortex solitons with higher vorticity ( @xmath140 ) may be stable @xcite .",
