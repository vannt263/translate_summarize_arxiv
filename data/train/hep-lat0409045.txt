    "the comparison of small dirac operator eigenvalues from lattice qcd to matrix models has been very successful at zero chemical potential  @xcite . at @xmath0",
    "detailed comparisons to the microscopic dirac operator origin spectrum have been few for two reasons .",
    "first , unquenched qcd suffers from a complex action problem and second , matrix model predictions where not available .",
    "very recently substantial progress has been made for complex chiral matrix models .",
    "quenched  @xcite and unquenched  @xcite predictions for qcd have been achieved , as well as results for adjoint gauge theories and staggered two color qcd  @xcite .",
    "they have been successfully tested for quenched qcd  @xcite , and our aim is to extend these results to other symmetry classes .",
    "the advantage of su(2 ) is to avoid the complex determinant of the action matrix  @xcite .",
    "already a few years ago , we computed the lowest eigenvalues of the unquenched su(2 ) dirac operator at @xmath0  @xcite , with low statistics though  @xcite .",
    "we redo the analysis as we can now compare to  @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we only present quenched results here .",
    "in ref .  @xcite a complex chiral matrix model with the same global symmetries as qcd at @xmath0 was introduced .",
    "its microscopic dirac spectrum was obtained only very recently @xcite , after previous asymptotic results in @xcite for a related model .",
    "although the presence of @xmath1 alters the chiral symmetry breaking patterns for su(2 ) and the adjoint representation , the symmetry analysis of dirac matrix elements being real , complex or quaternion remains valid  @xcite .",
    "following the two - matrix model approach @xcite new results for quaternionic matrices are now available @xcite .",
    "we only reproduce the quenched microscopic density here and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .    in qcd at @xmath2 , the lowest dirac eigenvalues scale with the volume @xmath3 to build up a finite condensate @xmath4 according to the banks - casher relation .",
    "at weak non - hermiticity , a concept first introduced in  @xcite , this scaling remains unchanged @xcite .",
    "the support of the density remains quasi one - dimensional as we send @xmath5 , keeping @xmath6 fixed . here",
    "@xmath7 is the size of the random matrix .",
    "in contrast to that , at strong non - hermiticity the eigenvalues fill a two - dimensional surface , and thus the scaling is modified to @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the quenched microscopic density at weak non - hermiticity in the sector of topological charge @xmath9 is reading  @xcite @xmath10 here , we have rescaled the complex eigenvalues according to @xmath11 .",
    "the limit of strong non - hermiticity can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ rhoweak ] ) .",
    "the resulting microscopic density is symmetric with respect to the axes @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the zero momentum sector of chiral perturbation theory with @xmath0 contains two parameters  @xcite , @xmath4 and the decay constant @xmath15 , with the relative rescaling between mass and @xmath1 term depending on the ratio only . in the weak limit",
    "( [ rhoweak ] ) becomes a function of @xmath16 only , by substituting @xmath17 .",
    "note that the first integral then runs to @xmath18 .",
    "however , at small @xmath19 this change of variables breaks down .",
    "the integral becomes approximately @xmath20-independent while the prefactor strongly varies with @xmath20 .",
    "thus in this regime eigenvalues @xmath21 ( or masses ) and @xmath1 can be rescaled independently with _ two _ parameters .",
    "our computations with gauge group su(2 ) on a @xmath22 lattice at @xmath23 have @xmath24 flavors of staggered fermions . for this system",
    "the fermion determinant is real and lattice simulations of the full theory with chemical potential are feasible . to compare with the quenched predictions from above",
    "we have chosen a large value for the quark mass @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the lattice spacing in physical units ) that effectively quenches the theory .",
    "we have checked this by comparing to simulations with @xmath27 , following exactly the same analytical curve as in fig .",
    "[ weakdata ] below .",
    "a phase transition occurs at @xmath28 where the chiral condensate goes to zero and a diquark condensate develops  @xcite .    at strong gauge coupling and thus away from the continuum limit , staggered fermions have the disadvantage of shifting the ( topological ) dirac zero modes and mixing them with the nonzero modes .",
    "we have accounted for this by setting @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ rhoweak ] ) above . only more sophisticated methods as improved actions  @xcite can recover topology in the staggered approach .",
    "we produced around 10000 configurations for two values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , corresponding to weakly and strongly non - hermitian lattice dirac operators , respectively .",
    "[ weakdata ] shows that the data agree very well to the functional form of eq .",
    "( [ rhoweak ] ) at weak non - hermiticity . after normalizing histograms and formula to unity",
    "we rescale the lattice eigenvalues @xmath21 by @xmath32 , with the spacing @xmath33 .",
    "the weak non - hermiticity parameter @xmath18 has been rescaled with a second parameter @xmath34 to match the data .",
    "in contrast to qcd with three colors  @xcite the symplectic symmetry class shows an additional suppression of eigenvalues along the real axis , resulting into the double peak structure .",
    "the zero modes are driven away from the real axis for @xmath1 as small as @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that the limit @xmath36 is discontinuous .     at @xmath30 vs.  eq .",

    "we have established the correct qualitative behavior from quenched data . a detailed analysis including different lattice volumes , scaling , and dynamical flavors with small mass is in progress .",
