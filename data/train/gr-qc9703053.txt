    "of late , there has been an increasing interest in numerical relativity and the application of numerical techniques to the study of dynamical gravitational objects .",
    "the reason for this is fairly clear : numerical relativity makes it possible to study physical situations that have defied analytic analysis .",
    "the nonsymmetric gravitational theory ( ngt ) ( see  , as well as  @xcite for the most recent discussion ) is an alternate theory of gravity that evolved from a re - interpretation of the einstein unified field theory ( uft ) ( see  ) , itself an extension of einstein s general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the theory proposes to do away with the assumption that the metric tensor describing spacetime is a symmetric , second - rank tensor , replacing it with a second - rank , nonsymmetric tensor .",
    "this tensor is typically written as the metric tensor in gr : @xmath0 . however , since a metric tensor is by definition a symmetric quantity , @xmath0 can not represent the metric of the ngt spacetime ; instead , we refer to it as the fundamental tensor ( see the discussion in   and in particular  @xcite ) .",
    "although on the surface the above - mentioned substitution appears innocuous , in reality it induces fundamental changes in the underlying structure of the theory , both physical and mathematical .",
    "indeed , because of the lack of a definite tensorial symmetry in the various quantities of the theory , the field equations of ngt are somewhat more complicated than the corresponding field equations of gr , as is the dynamical structure . for instance",
    ", it can be shown that a spherically symmetric gravitational field in gr is diffeomorphic to a static , spherically symmetric solution , so that all spherically symmetric stellar objects have a static exterior .",
    "this is known as birkhoff s theorem ( see for instance  @xcite , p.  372 ) .",
    "in contrast , it was demonstrated in  @xcite that there is no equivalent to birkhoff s theorem in ngt .",
    "hence , if we wish to study a stellar object even so simple as a spherically symmetric star in ngt , we must consider the full , time - dependent theory .",
    "the increased mathematical complication of the field equations of ngt _ versus _ those of gr has meant that ngt has been plagued since its inception by a distinct lack of exact , or in some cases even approximate , solutions .",
    "in particular , in addition to the ( trivial ) gr solutions , a single static solution to the spherically symmetric field equations is known to exist for massless ngt : the so - called wyman solution ( see  ) . the so - called papapetrou solution ( see  @xcite , in particular  ",
    "i ) has been formally eliminated from the theory ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the addition of terms to the action by moffat   does not simplify matters : exact solutions for the massive theory are even more elusive than for the massless theory .",
    "it therefore appears that ngt would be an ideal candidate for numerical investigations .    in this work , we begin the task of defining a formalism that will allow the application of the techniques developed in the field of numerical relativity to ngt ; the work was begun in  , where a hamiltonian formulation of ngt was derived from the action principle of the theory . it was found in these references that the antisymmetric degrees of freedom separate into two sectors , namely the wyman sector and the papapetrou sector .",
    "one of these sectors , specifically the papapetrou sector , is plagued with linearization instabilities ; this is , in fact , what motivated the work in  @xcite , which eliminates these degrees of freedom .",
    "however , since the two sectors of the theory are decoupled in evolution , by choosing wyman sector initial data , our results are equally applicable to most uft - like actions .",
    "the next section gives a brief overview of the coordinate choices and slicing conditions that allow us to rewrite the set of first - order field equations in a form appropriate for numerical study . in ",
    "[ sec : solvability ] we discuss the initial - value problem , as well as some difficulties that arise when dealing with a constrained set of field equations , in particular how those problems apply to ngt . in  [ sec : numerical_ngt ] we discuss the numerical techniques relevant to the solution of the initial - value problem of ngt .",
    "we also present one such generated solution and discuss its properties .",
    "the first appendix contains the spherically symmetric reduction of the field quantities , while the second appendix gives the conformal transformation rules of the field equations .",
    "the last appendix is a brief demonstration of two results used in ",
    "[ sec : solvability ] .",
    "early versions of ngt   consisted of a re - interpretation of uft , where the antisymmetric components of the fundamental tensor , originally introduced to represent the components of the electromagnetic field , were considered gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "the work in   necessitated the addition of two terms to the action .",
    "one of these , the so - called bonnor term ( see  @xcite ) , endowed the antisymmetric fields with a mass and introduced a parameter @xmath1 into the theory .",
    "this parameter is referred to interchangeably as the ngt mass parameter or the inverse of the ngt range parameter .",
    "the findings of  @xcite lead to a further modification of the theory , described in  @xcite .",
    "this left @xmath1 as a free parameter of the theory , with a potential phenomenological interpretation in applications such as galaxy dynamics ( see  @xcite ) .    rather than re - iterating the full set of four dimensional ngt field equations here",
    ", we will simply refer the interested reader to the literature ( see , for instance ,  , @xcite , and @xcite , among others ) .",
    "instead , we offer in appendices  [ sec : appendix_first - order_form ] and  [ sec : appendix_conformally - transformed_equations ] an overview of the spherically symmetric , wyman sector field equations written in first - order form ; these will be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "these appendices serve also to define the notation we use in this work .",
    "the goal of the current section is to make the coordinate choices and to choose the slicing conditions that will reduce the ngt field equations to a form amenable to numerical study .    upon performing a conformal transformation of the field variables : @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the inverse of",
    "the hypersurface metric and @xmath5 is its extrinsic curvature ( for details , see appendix  [ sec : appendix_conformally - transformed_equations ] ) , we find that , just as in gr , the hamiltonian and momentum constraints remain inter - twined . in order to make any headway in solving these constraints , we must find a way of decoupling them . in gr ,",
    "this is accomplished , for example , by using maximal slicing : @xmath6 = k^\\mu{}_\\nu = \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu } k_{\\mu\\nu } = 0 $ ] , which fully decouples the hamiltonian and momentum constraints . preserving this condition in time , @xmath7 = 0 $ ] ,",
    "yields a second - order elliptic equation for the lapse function : @xmath8 - nr^{(3 ) } = 0 $ ] ( see , for instance ,  ( 3.4 ) in ",
    "iii.b of  @xcite )",
    ". a similar approach can be taken in ngt ; however , the resulting `` lapse equation '' is not nearly as simple as its gr counterpart .",
    "instead , it turns out to be more profitable to take , @xmath9 } j_{[23]}$ ] and @xmath10 } k_{22 } - \\gamma^{22 } j_{[23]}$ ] . ]",
    "@xmath11 . in this case , the symmetric - sector components of the extrinsic curvature drop out completely from the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "although both the conformal factor and the extrinsic curvature still appear in the momentum constraint , it is only the @xmath12 component of the latter that appears .",
    "therefore , if a solution to the hamiltonian constraint can be found , this can be inserted into the momentum constraint , which can then be solved for the remaining component of the extrinsic curvature .    in",
    "spherical symmetry , there is only one coordinate choice to be made : a radial coordinate @xmath13 is chosen such that @xmath14})^2]^{1/2 } = r^{-2}(r)$ ] , where @xmath15 is some currently unspecified function ; we will choose @xmath16",
    ". this choice can obviously be satisfied by taking @xmath17 and @xmath18 } = r^{-2}(r)\\sin\\psi$ ] , or @xmath19 } / \\gamma^{22}$ ] .",

    "in fact , using the definition of the derivative operator @xmath23 $ ] given in  ( [ eq : derivative_definition ] ) , the hamiltonian constraint is written    [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint_both_forms ] @xmath24^{-1/2}\\phi [ 8\\delta_\\gamma[\\phi ] - \\phi r^{{\\rm ns}(3 ) } + 2 r^2\\phi^{-7}[(j^2{}_3)^2 - k^2{}_2(k^2{}_2 + 2 k^1{}_1 ) ] + \\case{1}{4}\\mu^2 r^2\\phi^5\\sin^2\\psi ] \\\\ & = & [ \\gamma^{11}]^{-1/2}\\phi [ 8r^2\\gamma^{11}\\partial_r^2[\\phi ]   + 16r\\gamma^{11}\\partial_r[\\phi ] + 4r^2\\partial_r[\\phi]\\partial_r[\\gamma^{11 } ] + \\case{1}{2}r^2\\phi\\gamma^{11}(\\partial_r[\\psi])^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq : hamiltonian_constraint } \\qquad\\hbox { } + 2r\\phi\\partial_r[\\gamma^{11 } ] - 2\\phi\\cos\\psi + 2\\phi\\gamma^{11 } + 2r^2(j^2{}_3)^2\\phi^{-7 } + \\case{1}{4}\\mu^2 r^2\\phi^5\\sin^2\\psi ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while the momentum constraint becomes @xmath25^{-1/2}(\\gamma^{11}k_{11}\\partial_r[\\ln(r^2\\phi^4 ) ] - j^2{}_3\\partial_r[\\psi ] ) = 0 $ ] .",
    "the latter one of these is solved for the sole remaining symmetric - sector component of the extrinsic curvature in a straightforward manner : @xmath26}{\\gamma^{11 }   \\partial_r[\\ln(r^2\\phi^4 ) ] } .\\ ] ] that the momentum constraint can be solved for @xmath12 in this fashion allows us to implement a `` semi - constrained '' evolution .",
    "what is more , by setting @xmath27 in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint ] ) , we obtain a first - order , ordinary differential equation for @xmath28 , whose solution on every time - slice would generate the evolution of that field variable .",
    "this would allow us to implement a fully constrained evolution , eliminating both the hamiltonian and momentum constraints , as well as the symmetric - sector evolution equations , hence by - passing the problems inherent in evolving a set of discretized field equations ( see , for instance , the discussion of the cauchy problem in  @xcite , as well as the issues raised in  @xcite and  @xcite on the maintenance of constraints during numerical evolution ) .",
    "however , at this time there does not seem to be any obvious advantage in doing this , and it would only further cloud the issue of the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint ( see   [ sec : solvability ] below ) . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen to implement the semi - constrained evolution mentioned above .",

    "this first - order , ordinary differential equation is solved on every time - slice for the lapse function . meanwhile , preserving the coordinate condition in time leads to an equation for the only non - trivial component of the shift function : @xmath32 - 2 n^1 \\partial_r[\\ln(r\\phi^2 ) ] - 2 n \\phi^{-6 } k^2{}_2 = 0 .\\ ] ] when @xmath11 , the solution of this is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a constant of integration ; here , we take @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 as @xmath37 , maintaining asymptotically flat spatial slices in evolution .",

    "in the words of york and piran , `` the initial value problem of a physical theory is ascertaining what data must be specified at a given time in order that the equations of motion determine uniquely the evolution of the system . ''",
    "( see  @xcite , p.  147 ) . in formulating ngt as a hamiltonian system , clayton ( see  @xcite ) laid most of the groundwork for the study of its initial - value problem .",
    "as with most lagrangian field theories , the field equations of ngt separate into a set of initial - value constraints that impose diffeomorphism invariance , and a set of evolution equations . in this section",
    ", we are concerned with the initial - value constraints of ngt , also known as the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "it was demonstrated in the previous section that the momentum constraint can be explicitly satisfied , as in  ( [ eq : solved_momentum_constraint ] ) , and we need not be concerned with it any further .",
    "meanwhile , the hamiltonian constraint is a second - order , ordinary differential equation for @xmath39 , the conformal factor . unlike the momentum constraint",
    ", the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint is by no means guaranteed .",
    "indeed , we can gain some insight by recognizing , as did wheeler ( see  ) the similarity between the hamiltonian constraint ( for a moment of time - symmetry ) and a scattering problem in non - relativistic schrdinger mechanics , with the curvature scalar playing the role of the potential .",
    "if @xmath40 is positive everywhere , then the hamiltonian will always have a solution , corresponding to scattering off a potential barrier .",
    "if the curvature scalar is negative but `` shallow '' enough , then a scattering solution will also exist .",
    "only if @xmath40 is negative and `` deep '' enough will a bound state begin to form , and hence no scattering solution will exist .",
    "this is the type of behaviour that will be manifest itself below : there are actually situations where the antisymmetric fields could be considered perturbations on a gr background , in the sense that they are by no means large , in which the hamiltonian constraint has no asymptotically flat solution . of course , the reason for this behaviour is that the derivatives of the antisymmetric variables enter the curvature scalar , along with the variables themselves .",
    "thus , one can choose values for the antisymmetric variables that are small in overall magnitude , but that are sharply peaked , causing a corresponding `` deepening of the well '' , which in turn causes the hamiltonian constraint to become unsolvable for an asymptotically flat spacetime .    in appendix  [",
    "sec : appendix_proof_of_criterion ] , we derive two results that are consequences of the existence of a solution to the hamiltonian constraint , given the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "in other words , the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint implies that the inequalities  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) and  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) are satisfied .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that these inequalities hold only for massless ngt , when @xmath41 .",
    "the mass term in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint_both_forms ] ) makes it considerably more difficult to generate similar inequalities for the case of massive ngt .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that these inequalities are consequences of the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint : to demonstrate that these inequalities actually imply that a solution to the hamiltonian constraint exists is a somewhat more involved process , and will be considered in the future .    given an initial data set , @xmath42 , we can use  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) to place a limit on the field variables that will allow us to solve the hamiltonian constraint for an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "the procedure is actually one of elimination : if we find values of the field variables for which  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) is not verified , then we may conclude that the hamiltonian constraint can not be solved for such an initial data set , as the proof in appendix  [ sec : appendix_proof_of_criterion ] concludes that if the hamiltonian constraint is solvable , then  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) is verified . )",
    "might very well be verified , yet the hamiltonian constraint might not possess a solution . ]",
    "this process is continued , making the initial data set evermore conservative , for instance by moving closer and closer to a minkowski space initial data set , until  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) is verified . at this point",
    ", we can not conclude that a solution of the hamiltonian constraint exists : rather , we conclude that a solution certainly _ does not _",
    "exist for less conservative initial data .    if this procedure is to help us in placing limits on the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint",
    ", then we require a ( non - trivial ) function @xmath43 that makes the left - hand side of  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) a minimum .",
    "this function is well - known  @xcite : @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath45 is a constant , and the factor of @xmath46 in the numerator is included to make the value of the left - hand side of  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) independent of @xmath45 ;  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) is obviously invariant under such a scaling of @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is then used to make the value of the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) as large as possible . note in particular that the maximum of @xmath43 occurs at @xmath47 .    as noted in appendix  [",
    "sec : appendix_proof_of_criterion ] , the two inequalities  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) and  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) are used to different ends .",
    "we mentioned above that  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) is used to find a _",
    "most _ conservative initial data set @xmath42 for which the hamiltonian constraint is guaranteed to be unsolvable . on the other hand ,  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) is used to find a _",
    "least _ conservative initial data set for which the hamiltonian constraint is guaranteed to be solvable . in a sense , the two inequalities ,  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) and  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) are used to `` sandwich ''",
    "the limiting initial data set where the hamiltonian constraint is just barely solvable .",
    "in this work , we are considering initial data sets in which @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and where @xmath50 has the form of a pulse : @xmath51 ^ 2 e^{-(r - r_0)^2 / \\sigma^2 } .\\ ] ] the dimensionless parameter @xmath52 gives the overall amplitude of the pulse , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 are lengths that fix the position and the width , respectively , of the pulse ; the location of the maximum of the pulse is @xmath55^{1/2}]$ ] .",
    "this particular function was chosen because the gaussian factor causes both @xmath50 and its derivatives to vanish quite rapidly away from @xmath53 , while the factor of @xmath56 ^ 2 $ ] ensures that the ricci curvature scalar in  ( [ eq : ricci_scalar ] ) remains finite as @xmath57 . in a sense ,",
    "the pulse is `` semi - localized '' about @xmath58 , allowing us to study the properties of ngt initial data without having to worry about this will affect the boundary conditions .",
    "for such an initial data set , the curvature scalar is more or less peaked about @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath60 , in order to maximize the value of the integrand , @xmath61 .",
    "the remaining three free parameters , @xmath52 , @xmath54 , and @xmath53 , are adjusted in the manner discussed above until the inequality in  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) is no longer verified .",
    "for instance , since taking @xmath62 reduces the initial data set to that of minkowski space , then we expect to find some maximum value @xmath63 which renders the hamiltonian constraint unsolvable .",
    "of course , this is intuitively obvious : if there is to be a data set for which the hamiltonian constraint can not be solved for an asymptotically flat spacetime , then we expect that data set to correspond to a strong - field region . however , as was mentioned above , it is not only the overall scale of the antisymmetric variables that affects the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint , but also the scale of their derivatives . in particular , smaller values of the width parameter @xmath54 will cause @xmath50 to become correspondingly more peaked , and the ensuing increase in its derivative could feasibly make the hamiltonian constraint unsolvable .    as we approach a region of unsolvability in the parameter space ,",
    "the mass of the system , as measured by an observer in the asymptotically flat region , begins to increase without bound .",
    "this is to be expected : a large value of the mass would arise out of a spacetime of such great curvature that it can no longer be represented by an asymptotically flat manifold .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to measure the mass of the system as a function of the parameters of the pulse defining @xmath50 . through an analysis of the surface terms that arise out of the canonical decomposition of the action",
    "@xcite , it can be shown that the adm mass ( see  @xcite ) for asymptotically flat initial data is @xmath64 \\ , ds_b\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the boundary of the spatial slice and where @xmath66 is the adm mass of the conformal metric and @xmath67 is the adm mass of the physical metric .",
    "for the conformally flat field variables we consider , and given the fall - off that we have assumed , it is a simple matter to demonstrate that  ( [ eq : adm_mass_in_ngt_in_general ] ) reduces to @xmath68 \\",
    ", r^2 dr % \\rightarrow -2\\int_0^{+\\infty } \\bigl[\\partial_r^2[\\phi ]   % + \\frac{2}{r}\\partial_r[\\phi]\\bigr]\\,r^2 dr , \\ ] ] where the derivative operator @xmath23 $ ] is defined in  ( [ eq : derivative_definition ] ) .",
    "once a solution to the hamiltonian constraint is found , it can be inserted into  ( [ eq : adm_mass_in_ngt ] ) , and the mass @xmath67 calculated ; note that this mass is guaranteed to be positive as @xmath40 and the bonnor term are negative definite .",
    "alternately , if we assume that @xmath69 asymptotically , where @xmath67 is a constant , we can read off the value of @xmath67 by inspecting the behaviour of @xmath39 in the asymptotic region .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a numerical scheme that can be used to analyze the initial - value problem of ngt .",
    "in addition to presenting a typical solution to the hamiltonian constraint , we use this scheme and the conditions discussed above to place limits on the solvability of the initial - value problem in ngt .",
    "as written , the hamiltonian constraint  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint ] ) is a second - order , ordinary differential equation for the conformal factor @xmath39 .",
    "there are two important points to note .",
    "firstly , suppose we choose gr initial conditions : _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath48 , @xmath70 ( standard spherical coordinates ) , and vanishing antisymmetric - sector data ( @xmath71 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint then reduces to @xmath72 + 2 r \\partial_r[\\phi ]   = \\partial_r[r^2 \\partial_r[\\phi ] ] = 0 $ ] , whose solution is @xmath73 , where @xmath67 is a constant of integration , physically interpreted as being the mass defined by  ( [ eq : adm_mass_in_ngt ] ) . secondly ,",
    "when @xmath74 , the hamiltonian constraint is a non - linear , second - order , ordinary differential equation for the conformal factor , in contrast to gr , where the hamiltonian constraint for a vacuum spacetime is linear in the conformal factor when the extrinsic curvature vanishes ( moment of time symmetry ) ; to see the non - linear behaviour , matter or energy of some kind must be added to the system .",
    "of course , this non - linearity in the hamiltonian constraint is a manifestation of the fact that , loosely speaking , the antisymmetric - sector fields behave like matter or energy to the symmetric - sector fields , albeit with a nontrivial interaction .",
    "fortunately , since the hamiltonian constraint in spherical symmetry is an ordinary differential equation , we can use a fairly simple scheme for its solution , and it is this procedure that we describe in this section .",
    "since we are considering initial data that are concentrated in an area of the initial slice , in those areas of the initial slice where the initial data of the antisymmetric sector are vanishing or nearly so , @xmath39 will be more or less approximated by its gr solution , @xmath75 , where @xmath67 is either some constant or a linear function of @xmath13 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a schwarzschild - like region of the initial slice , while the second case is physically equivalent to a flat , minkowski region of the initial slice .",
    "is a linear function of @xmath13 , then @xmath76 is some constant , and therefore @xmath39 is a constant other than unity .",
    "however , by rescaling the basis vectors , we can absorb this constant and make @xmath27 , just as in the case of minkowski space .",

    "however , what is somewhat more surprising is how quickly the solution to the hamiltonian constraint relaxes to its gr form outside the influence of the antisymmetric sector field variables .",
    "in fact , it is clear from figure  [ fig : conformal_factor_sample_blow - up ] that in the region @xmath121 , @xmath39 has essentially returned to its gr form : the difference between the two curves in the graph is at its greatest less than @xmath122 , and this despite the fact that this region lies within two widths of the central peak of @xmath50 . indeed , at @xmath123 , @xmath124 , which is hardly negligible .",
    "this demonstrates the rather surprising result that the antisymmetric field variables can very well be non - trivial , and yet the gravitational system as a whole still behaves very much like gr , at least as far as the initial - value problem is concerned .    in figures  [ fig : mass_versus_a_massless ] through  [ fig : mass_versus_position_massive ] we present plots of the measured mass of the gravitational field versus the various parameters of the pulse ; the value of the parameters that remain fixed for the plot are given in the figure caption .",

    "of particular importance is the behaviour of the mass as a function of the pulse width , @xmath54 , for the case of massive ngt .",
    "we see from figure  [ fig : mass_versus_sigma_massive ] that there is a _ maximum _ value of @xmath54 above which the hamiltonian constraint is no longer solvable . loosely speaking",
    ", this implies that the pulse  ( [ eq : not_so_gaussian_pulse ] ) must be sufficiently small _ and _ sufficiently peaked ( for a given amplitude ) in order for a solution to the hamiltonian constraint to exist .",
    "this seems somewhat counter - intuitive ; however , when @xmath74 , we see from  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint_both_forms ] ) that the term proportional to @xmath125 contains a factor of @xmath126 , and is also proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "an increasing value of the width causes the factor of @xmath126 to become non - trivial in a larger region of the spatial slice , thereby increasing the energy contained in the gravitational system .",
    "consequently , this forces @xmath39 to stray from its assumed @xmath100 fall - off , and the hamiltonian constraint becomes unsolvable .",
    "it therefore stands to reason that this highly non - linear term can affect the resulting solution to a great extent .",
    "of course , a similar behaviour can be observed in the abscence of this term : loosely speaking , increasing the width increases the amount of antisymmetric field that is present on the spatial slice , therefore adding to the energy of the system .",
    "however , we have found that this occurs at width values on the order of @xmath128 , where @xmath129 .",
    "the inequalities in appendix  [ sec : appendix_proof_of_criterion ] give @xmath130 .",
    "we conclude that the non - linear term in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint_both_forms ] ) simply compounds this problem .",
    "we note from the figures that there are clearly defined asymptotes in the mass as a function of the parameter being investigated ; these asymptotes correspond to the divergence of the mass as we approach a region of unsolvability of the hamiltonian constraint in the parameter space .",
    "in particular , the mass plots for massless ngt have asymptotes which respect the bounds set by the results of appendix  [ sec : appendix_proof_of_criterion ] .",
    "for instance , from figure  [ fig : mass_versus_a_massless ] we see that the asymptote of the mass as a function of the amplitude lies at @xmath131 .",

    "similarly , the asymptote of the mass as a function of the width squared ( see figure  [ fig : mass_versus_sigma_massless ] ) lies at about @xmath134 for @xmath107 .",
    "this is to be compared with the bounds of  @xmath135 and  @xmath136 obtained from  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) and  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) , respectively .",
    "finally , the asymptote of the mass as a function of the position of the pulse @xmath53 ( see figure  [ fig : mass_versus_position_massless ] ) lies at @xmath137 for @xmath138 , in comparison to the values of  @xmath139 and  @xmath140 obtained from  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) and  ( [ eq : strong_condition_on_phi ] ) , respectively .",
    "generically , the asymptotes of the mass are more clearly defined for massless ngt than for massive ngt .",
    "this is most pronounced when plotting the mass @xmath67 versus the position of the pulse @xmath53 : it is clear from figure  [ fig : mass_versus_position_massive ] that the asymptotic value of @xmath53 has not been reached .",
    "the reason for this is the same as mentioned above : the non - linear term in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint_both_forms ] ) begins to grow significantly , and the numerical code fails to find a solution .",
    "it is also interesting to note that when determining the bounds on the region of solvability for variations in @xmath54 ( see figure  [ fig : mass_versus_sigma_massless ] ) ,  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) seems to give particularly bad results , being off by a full order of magnitude .",
    "although the predicted bound does not contradict the actual result , and no claim was made as to the accuracy of  ( [ eq : weak_condition_on_phi ] ) , the reason for why there is such a large discrepancy is unknown at this time .",
    "when calculating the adm mass of a system , we must take into account the fact that our numerical grid is not of infinite size , whereas  ( [ eq : adm_mass_in_ngt_in_general ] ) implicitly assumes that the evaluation is performed at infinity . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_convergence ] we show how the adm mass varies as the size of the grid is increased , for the initial data @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 given by  ( [ eq : not_so_gaussian_pulse ] ) , where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "finally , it is important to verify that the solution @xmath39 obtained by numerical means actually satisfies the hamiltonian constraint , and if so , how well .",
    "this is somewhat of a thorny issue since , for a vacuum spacetime , the correct solution must make the hamiltonian constraint vanish .",

    "( see appendix  a.3 in  @xcite ) is to use the fact that in a non - vacuum spacetime , the hamiltonian must be equated to the matter contributions : @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the error in the determination of @xmath39 can be viewed as a `` matter contribution '' to the right - hand side of the hamiltonian constraint .",

    "the adm mass and the residual hamiltonian are given in the same units as @xmath83 , the grid spacing .",
    "we see that as the grid spacing is reduced , the adm mass converges to a definite value , in this case @xmath113 , and residual hamiltonian decreases roughly as @xmath152 .",

    "we have demonstrated that the initial - value problem of ngt can be solved by numerical means , and that the solutions behave essentially as one would expect , based on a careful physical analysis of the situation , as described at the beginning of   [ sec : numerical_ngt ] .",

    "what is surprising , however , is that certain seemingly acceptable configurations do not form a well - posed initial - value problem . in particular , for the case of the massive theory ( @xmath153 ) , it was found that the antisymmetric field variables had to have particularly rapid fall - off in the asymptotic region in order to guarantee that the initial slice be asymptotically flat ; otherwise , the final term in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_constraint ] ) , proportional to both @xmath154 and @xmath127 , would feed back into the solution and destroy the desired asymptotic behaviour .    the behaviour of the adm mass , or rather its ngt equivalent , was found to be a good indication of the solvability of the hamiltonian constraint . indeed , far from regions of unsolvability , the adm mass was very small , corresponding to a weak field rgime .",
    "on the other hand , near regions of unsolvability , the adm mass became very large .",
    "but in the latter cases , the mass always began to display signs of reaching an asymptote .",
    "again , this corresponds well with the underlying physical picture : a large mass can not be obtained from an asymptotically flat spacetime , so demanding that the mass be large by increasing the size of the antisymmetric field variables causes us to step off the constraint surface , thereby violating the hamiltonian constraint .    of course , there remains much to be explored .",
