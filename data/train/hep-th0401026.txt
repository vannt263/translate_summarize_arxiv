    "in the electromagnetism , oppositely charged particles under the uniform electric field separate from each other to cancel out the background flux .",
    "this is the well - known dielectric effect , and analogous phenomena can be observed in the type ii superstring theories and the m - theory@xcite .",
    "let us illustrate the dielectric phenomenon in the type iia superstring theory with the case where a spherical d2-brane is located in the background of coincident ns5-branes@xcite .",
    "ns5-branes carry the magnetic charge of the ns - ns 2-form potential , and its 3-from flux vertically penetrates three dimensional sphere @xmath0 which encloses ns5-branes in the transverse space .",
    "the d2-brane is assumed to be spherical in the @xmath0 . in case",
    "there is no magnetic flux on the d2-brane , it collapses because of its tension . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic flux exists on the d2-brane , the background ns - ns 3-form flux supports it against the collapse .",
    "notice that the number of the magnetic flux on the d2-brane is less than that of ns5-branes .",
    "this is the dielectric effect in the type iia superstring theory .",
    "interestingly the dielectric phenomena in the type ii superstring theories admit the dual descriptions .",
    "namely similar dielectric effects are observed from the dynamics of d0-branes , which are identical to the magnetic flux on the d2-brane@xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables of @xmath1 coincident d0-branes are @xmath2 gauge field and nine adjoint scalars , and the latter represent the position of d0-branes when they are simultaneously diagonalized . in the background of ns5-branes , d0-branes form a fuzzy ( noncommutative ) geometry in the @xmath0 because of the support from the ns - ns 3-form flux@xcite .",
    "in fact d0-branes compose a fuzzy sphere in the @xmath0 , which matches the d2-brane picture when the number of d0-branes or magnetic flux is sufficiently large .",
    "this is called the myers effect@xcite .    since the essence of the dielectric effect and the myers effect is the existence of the background flux , at first sight it seems impossible to observe these effects in purely gravitational backgrounds .",
    "note , however , that the ns5-brane is related via t - duality to a kaluza - klein monopole which forms the purely gravitational geometry@xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect gravitational versions of the dielectric effect and the myers effect in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the spherical d2-brane in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles in the type iia superstring theory .",
    "the geometry of the 10 dimensional kaluza - klein monopoles is described by @xmath3 , where the @xmath4 is equivalent to @xmath5 but the @xmath6 vanishes at the origin .",
    "the d2-brane is spherically wrapped around the origin of the @xmath7 and has momentum along the @xmath6 .",
    "then we will see that the spherical d2-brane with some finite radius becomes the classical solution of the d2-brane action .",
    "since the background is purely gravitational , this is exactly the case where the dielectric effect is induced via the gravity",
    ".    the above system is easily reinterpreted in the framework of the 11 dimensional m - theory .",
    "the 10 dimensional kaluza - klein monopole is just lifted to a 11 dimensional kaluza - klein monopole , @xmath8 , and the d2-brane is done to a m2-brane .",
    "of course the m2-brane moving along the @xmath6 in the @xmath4 is spherically stable around the origin of the @xmath7 .",
    "this is the gravitational dielectric effect in the m - theory .",
    "now we change the roles of the two @xmath6s in the above discussion , which is often called the 9 - 11 flip in the m - theory .",
    "after the dimensional reduction to the 10 dimensional spacetime , we obtain spherical d2-d0 bound state in the background of d6-branes in the type iia superstring theory@xcite . as discussed before , this system will admit the dual description of d0-branes , that is , the myers effect .",
    "we will see that the fuzzy sphere composed by d0-branes really becomes a classical solution of equations of motion in the background of d6-branes .",
    "this is the gravitational myers effect in the type iia superstring theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the gravitational dielectric effect in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles and d6-branes in the type iia superstring theory . in section 3",
    ", we observe the gravitational myers effect in the background of d6-branes .",
    "the stability of the spherical configuration of the d2-d0 bound state in the background of d6-branes is examined in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section we study the dielectric effects which are induced not by the background flux but by the gravitational force . at first sight",
    "it seems difficult to observe the gravitational dielectric phenomena in the absence of the background flux .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , the spherical d2-d0 bound state is stable in the background of ns5-branes , and by the t - duality transformation this background is related to the kaluza - klein monopoles which are purely gravitational objects . therefore it is interesting to study whether the gravitational dielectric effect can be observed in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles .    in the following we investigate a single d2-brane with @xmath1 units of magnetic flux on its world - volume in the background of @xmath9 coincident kaluza - klein monopoles .",

    "we assume that the d2-brane is spherical and moving along the @xmath13 direction in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles .",
    "so the world - volume coordinates @xmath29 are identified with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . now the d2-brane is located in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles which are purely gravitational objects , the relevant part of the d2-brane action is only the born - infeld part .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate born - infeld part of the d2-brane action . by substituting these assumptions for the action ,",
    "it becomes as @xmath32 in order to examine the stability of this system , it is convenient to switch to the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the canonical momentum conjugate to the variable @xmath13 is given by @xmath33 note that the @xmath13 direction is compactified with the circle , so the total momentum should be conserved as @xmath34 where @xmath1 is an integer .",
    "then we obtain the hamiltonian of the form @xmath35 the interpretation of this hamiltonian ( [ eq : e2 ] ) is as follows .",
    "the first square root part is the correction to the volume factor of the sphere @xmath36 , because of the nontrivial winding of @xmath37 along the compactified direction .",
    "terms in the second square root are the sum of the mass squared of the spherical d2-brane and the momentum energy squared along compactified direction .",
    "notice that the radii of sphere and compactified direction are affected by gravitational factor @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "these modifications are expected from the form of the metric ( [ eq : kkmono ] ) .",
    "let us examine the stability of the spherical d2-brane in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles . in the region of @xmath39 , the factor @xmath38",
    "is approximated as @xmath40 , and the spherical d2-brane shrinks to a point because of its tension .",
    "on the other hand , near the region of @xmath41 , the spherical d2-brane tends to expand because of the repulsive force between the momentum along the @xmath13 direction and the kaluza - klein monopoles .",
    "thus we obtain the gravitational dielectric effect .    in order to see this effect in detail , we focus on the neighborhood of the kaluza - klein monopoles . in this region , @xmath42 ,",
    "the factor @xmath38 is approximated as @xmath43 , and the conservations of the momentum ( [ eq : conmom ] ) and the energy ( [ eq : e1 ] ) are written like @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",

    ", the gravitational dielectric phenomenon of the spherical d2-brane with the momentum in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles is observed in the type iia superstring theory .",
    "this system is easily lifted to the 11 dimensional m - theory , and we obtain a dielectric effect of a spherical m2-brane with momentum along the compactified direction @xmath13 in the background of 11 dimensional kaluza - klein monopoles .",
    "again we reduce the 11 dimensional spacetime to the 10 dimensional one , by identifying the @xmath13 direction with the reduced 10th one .",
    "then the 11 dimensional kaluza - klein monopoles become d6-branes in the type iia superstring theory@xcite . and",
    "the m2-brane with the momentum along the reduced @xmath13 direction turns into a bound state of a d2-brane and d0-branes .",
    "consequently the dielectric effect of the spherical d2-d0 bound state in the background of d6-branes will be obtained in the type iia superstring theory . in this subsection",
    "we will see this phenomenon from the viewpoint of the effective theory on the d2-brane , where d0-branes are identical to the magnetic flux on it .",
    "the d6-brane is extending to @xmath51 dimensional spacetime and carries the magnetic charge of the r - r 1-form potential @xmath52 .",
    "the classical solution of @xmath9 coincident d6-branes is given by@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the r - r 2-form flux originating from the d6-branes .",
    "as in the previous subsection , the d2-brane is embedded into the background of d6-branes spherically , so the world - volume coordinates on the d2-brane @xmath29 are identified with @xmath30 .",
    "on the d2-brane we introduce electric field @xmath56 and magnetic field @xmath57 .",
    "total magnetic flux on the spherical d2-brane is given by @xmath58 .",
    "now it is straightforward to evaluate the d2-brane action , and the lagrangian density is given by @xmath59 the momentum conjugate to @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 and we obtain the hamiltonian of the form @xmath62 terms in the second square root are mass squared of the spherical d2-brane and @xmath1 d0-branes , respectively .",

    "far from the d6-branes the factor @xmath38 is approximated as @xmath40 , and the spherical d2-brane shrinks to reduce the total energy . on the other hand , near the d6-branes the factor @xmath38 is approximated as @xmath66 , and the d2-brane tends to expand to reduce the energy .",

    "the fuzzy sphere is unstable and shrinks to a point because of its tension .    on the other hand ,",

    "we consider another type of myers effect which is induced via the gravitational force . in the previous section we observed the gravitational dielectric phenomena in the background of kaluza - klein monopoles and d6-branes .",
    "since the dielectric effect admits the dual description , i.e. , the myers effect , the gravitational myers effect will also be observed in these backgrounds .",

    "the d2-brane will be deformed and decay through the tachyon condensation process .",
    "the numerical result on this deformation is shown in the appendix a.    to avoid the above instability , we just prepare more d6-branes around the original ones properly .",
    "d0-branes will meet the potential barrier before they go away from the original d6-branes .",

    "the spherical d2-brane with the momentum along the compactified circle becomes the classical solution .",
    "this phenomenon is occurred because the tension of the spherical d2-brane balances with the repulsive force between the kaluza - klein monopoles and the momentum along the circle .    as the kaluza - klein monopoles are related to the d6-branes via t - s - t duality",
    ", it is expected that the gravitational dielectric effect occurs in the background of d6-branes .",
    "in fact we find that the spherical d2-brane with magnetic flux on it becomes the classical solution with the finite radius .",
    "furthermore the similar effect is obtained from the viewpoint of d0-branes , that is , d0-branes compose the fuzzy sphere in the background of d6-branes .",
    "we called this phenomenon the gravitational myers effect . in the continuous limit",
    ", the gravitational myers effect coincides with the gravitational dielectric effect .",
    "the essence of both effects is the fact that the tension of the spherical d2-brane balances with the repulsive force between the d6-branes and the d0-branes .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the gravitational dielectric effect and myers effect are insensitive to the charges carried by kaluza - klein monopoles or d - branes .",
    "consequently , for instance , a bound state of an anti - d2-brane and d0-branes spherically expands in the background of d6-branes or anti - d6-branes .",
    "this is in contrast with the dielectric phenomena induced by the background flux .    by examining the fluctuations around the spherical d2-d0 bound state",
    "we see that this configuration is unstable and the final state is conjectured by employing the numerical analyses . to avoid this instability",
    ", we need more d6-branes around the original ones",
    ". then the dielectric d2-d0 bound state will be stable aginst collapse .",
    "let us consider generalization of the gravitational dielectric effect to other d@xmath136-branes background .",
