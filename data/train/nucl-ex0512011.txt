    "recently the possibility of extracting information on the symmetry energy and the isospin ( neutron - to - proton ratio ) of the fragments in a multifragmentation reaction has gained tremendous importance @xcite .",
    "such information is of importance for understanding some of the key problems in astrophysics @xcite , and various aspects of nuclear physics such as the structure of exotic nuclei ( the binding energy and rms radii ) @xcite and the dynamics of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the symmetry energy of nuclei has been extracted by fitting the binding energy in their ground state with various versions of the liquid drop mass formula @xcite .",
    "the properties of nuclear matter are then determined by theoretically extrapolating the nuclear models designed to study the structure of real nuclei",
    ". however , real nuclei are cold , nearly symmetric ( @xmath3 ) and found at equilibrium density .",
    "it is not known how the symmetry energy behaves at temperatures , isospin ( neutron - to - proton ratio ) and densities away from the normal nuclear matter .",
    "theoretical many - body calculations @xcite and those from the empirical liquid drop mass formula @xcite predict symmetry energy near normal nuclear density ( @xmath4 0.17 @xmath5 ) and temperature ( @xmath6 @xmath4 0 mev ) , to be around 28 - 32 mev .    in a multifragmentation reaction",
    ", an excited nucleus expands to a sub - nuclear density and disintegrates into various light and heavy fragments @xcite .",
    "the fragments are highly excited and neutron - rich ; their yields depend on the available free energy which in turn depends on the strength of the symmetry energy and the extent to which the fragments expand . by studying the isotopic yield distribution of these fragments",
    ", one can extract important information about the symmetry energy and the properties of the fragments at densities , excitation energies and isospin away from those of ground state nuclei .",
    "experimentally , the determination of fragment isotopic yield distribution is not straight forward .",
    "it is influenced by the complex de - excitation of the hot ( primary ) fragments into observed cold ( secondary ) fragments .",
    "theoretical calculations of the secondary de - excitations require accurate accounting of the feeding from the particle unstable states and are subject to uncertainties in the levels that can be excited , and the structure effects that govern their decay @xcite .    from various statistical model approaches @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the ratio of primary fragment yield for a given isotope or isotone produced in two different reactions with similar temperature , exhibit an exponential dependence on proton and neutron number , an observation known as isoscaling .",
    "the dependence has been interpreted in terms of a scaling parameter that is related to the symmetry energy of the primary fragment binding energy .",
    "the scaling parameter has been shown to be independent of the complex nature of the secondary de - excitation and is thus a robust observable for studying the fragment isotopic yield distribution .    in a recent work @xcite",

    "@xcite , in their recent work studied the fragmentation of excited target residues following collisions of @xmath7c on @xmath8sn , at incident energies of 300 and 600 mev / nucleon .",
    "they observed that the symmetry energy co - efficient deduced from the data are near 25 mev for peripheral collisions and lower than 15 mev for the central collisions .",
    "@xcite , studied the fragments produced in the multifragmentation of @xmath9xe projectiles in mid - peripheral collisions with a lead target at 1 gev / nucleon .",
    "they used both , the @xmath10 ratio and the isoscaling of the fragments and found that the experimentally determined value of the scaling parameter can be reproduced within the statistical model framework by lowering the symmetry energy to as low as 11 - 12 mev .",
    "the @xmath10 ratios of the fragments on the other hand , could be reproduced with symmetry energy co - efficient as low as 14 - 15 mev .    in this work ,",
    "we study the primary fragment yield distribution in a number of reactions at various excitation energies and isospins using the isoscaling approach and the equilibrium statistical multifragmentation model .",
    "it is observed that the isoscaling parameter @xmath2 for the hot fragments decreases with increasing excitation energy and decreasing symmetry energy",
    ". the alpha values also increase with increasing difference in the isospin ( neutron - to - proton asymmetry ) of the fragmenting system .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed for the cold secondary fragments .",
    "the secondary de - excitation is found to have very little influence on the isoscaling parameter at lower excitation energies and isospin of the fragmenting system .",
    "the symmetry energy however , strongly influence the properties of the hot fragments .",
    "the experimentally determined isoscaling parameters can be explained by symmetry energy that is significantly lower than that for the normal ( cold ) nuclei at saturation density , indicating that the properties of nuclei at high excitation energy , isospin and reduced density are sensitive to the symmetry energy .",

    "the experiments were carried out at the cyclotron institute of texas a@xmath11 m university ( tamu ) using the k500 superconducting cyclotron where targets of @xmath1fe ( 2.3 mg/@xmath12 ) and @xmath1ni ( 1.75 mg/@xmath12 ) were bombarded with beams of @xmath0ar and @xmath0ca at 25 , 33 , 45 and 53 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "the various combinations of target and projectile nuclei allowed for a range of @xmath13 ( neutron - to - proton ratio ) ( 1.04 - 1.23 ) of the system to be studied , while keeping the total mass constant ( @xmath14 = 98 ) .",
    "the beams were fully stripped by allowing them to pass through a thin aluminum foil before being hit at the center of the target inside the tamu 4@xmath15 neutron ball @xcite .",
    "light charged particles ( @xmath16 @xmath17 2 ) and intermediate mass fragments ( @xmath16 @xmath18 2 ) were detected using six discrete telescopes placed inside the scattering chamber of the neutron ball at angles of 10@xmath19 , 44@xmath19 , 72@xmath19 , 100@xmath19 , 128@xmath19 and 148@xmath19 . a schematic diagram of the setup showing placement of the telescopes within the scattering chamber of the neutron ball is shown in figure .",
    "each telescope consisted of a gas ionization chamber ( ic ) followed by a pair of silicon detectors ( si - si ) and a csi scintillator detector , providing three distinct detector pairs ( ic - si , si - si , and si - csi ) for fragment identification .",
    "the ionization chamber was of axial field design and was operated with cf@xmath20 gas at a pressure of 50 torr .",
    "the gaseous medium was 6 cm thick with a typical threshold of @xmath21 0.5 mev / nucleon for intermediate mass fragments .",
    "the silicon detectors had an active area of 5 cm @xmath22 5 cm and were each subdivided into four quadrants .",
    "the first and second silicon detectors in the stack were 0.14 mm and 1 mm thick , respectively .",
    "the dynamical energy range of the silicon pair was @xmath21 16 - 50 mev for @xmath23he and @xmath21 90 - 270 mev for @xmath7c .",
    "the csi scintillator crystals that followed the silicon detector pair were 2.54 cm in thickness and were read out by photodiodes .",
    "good elemental ( @xmath16 ) identification was achieved for fragments that punched through the ic detector and stopped in the first silicon detector .",
    "fragments measured in the si - si detector pair also had good isotopic separation .",
    "the trigger for the data acquisition was generated by requiring a valid hit in one of the silicon detectors .",
    "the calibration of the ic - si detectors were carried out using the standard alpha sources and by operating the ic at various gas pressures .",
    "the si - si detectors were calibrated by measuring the energy deposited by the alpha particles in the thin silicon and the punch - through energies of different isotopes in the thick silicon .",
    "the si - csi detectors were calibrated by selecting points along the different light charged isotopes and determining the energy deposited in the csi crystal from the energy loss in the calibrated si detector .",
    "neutrons were measured with the 4@xmath15 neutron ball that surrounded the detector assembly .",
    "the neutron ball consisted of eleven scintillator tanks segmented in its median plane and surrounding the vacuum chamber .",
    "the upper and the lower tank were 1.5 m diameter hemispheres .",
    "nine wedge - shaped detectors were sandwiched between the hemispheres .",
    "all the wedges subtended 40@xmath19 in the horizontal plane .",
    "the neutron ball were filled with a pseudocumene based liquid scintillator mixed with 0.3 weight percent of gd salt ( gd 2-ethyl hexanoate ) .",
    "scintillations from thermal neutrons captured by gd were detected by twenty 5-in phototubes : five in each hemisphere , one on each of the identical 40@xmath19 wedges and two on the forward edges .",
    "the efficiency with which the neutrons could be detected is about 83@xmath24 , as measured with a @xmath25cf source .",
    "the detected neutrons were used to differentiate between the central and peripheral collisions . to understand the effectiveness of neutron multiplicity as a centrality trigger ,",
    "simulations were carried out using a hybrid buu - gemini calculations at various impact parameters for the @xmath0ca + @xmath1fe reaction at 33 mev / nucleon .",
    "the simulated neutron multiplicity distribution was compared with the experimentally measured distribution . the multiplicity of neutron for the impact parameter _",
    "b _ = 0 collisions was found to be higher than the _ b _ = 5 collision . by gating on the 10@xmath24 highest neutron multiplicity events",
    ", one could clearly discriminate against the peripheral events .    to determine the contributions from noncentral impact parameter collisions , neutrons emitted in coincidence with fragments at 44@xmath19 and 152@xmath19 were calculated at _",

    "b _ = 0 fm , and the number of events with the same neutron multiplicity at _ b _ = 5 fm .",
    "the ratios were observed to    ca + @xmath1ni ( stars and solid lines ) , @xmath0ar + @xmath1ni ( circles and dashed lines ) and @xmath0ar + @xmath1fe ( squares and dotted lines ) reactions at various beam energies.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    be 19.0 and 11.1 at 44@xmath19 and 1.3 and 2.2 at 152@xmath19 for 33 and 45 mev / nucleon respectively . at intermediate angles , high neutron multiplicities were observed to be outside the region in which _ b _ = 5 fm contributes significantly . at backward angles the collisions at",
    "_ b _ = 5 fm made a larger contribution to the neutron multiplicity .",
    "in addition to the neutron multiplicity distribution , the charge distribution of the fragments was also used to investigate the contributions from central and mid - impact parameter collisions .",
    "the _ b _ = 5 collisions produced essentially no fragments with charge greater than three in the 44@xmath19 telescope .    in an earlier work @xcite",
    ", some analysis of the fragment kinetic energy and charge distributions were presented .",
    "it was shown that at a laboratory angle of 44@xmath19 the kinetic energy and the charge distributions are well reproduced by the statistical model calculation .",
    "using a moving source analysis of the fragment energy spectra , it was also shown that the fragments emitted at backward angles originate from a target - like source , while those emitted at 44@xmath19 originate primarily from a composite source . in this work",
    ", we will concentrate exclusively on data from the laboratory angle of 44@xmath19 to study the symmetry energy and the isoscaling properties of the fragments produced .",
    "the choice of this angle enables one to select events which are predominantly central and undergo bulk multifragmentation .",
    "the contributions to the intermediate mass fragments from the projectile - like and target - like sources can therefore be assumed to be minimal and the use of equilibrium statistical model appropriately justified .",
    "the experimentally measured relative isotopic yield distributions for the lithium ( left ) , berillium ( center ) and carbon ( right ) elements , in @xmath0ca + @xmath1ni ( star symbols ) , @xmath0ar + @xmath1ni ( circle symbols ) and @xmath0ar + @xmath1fe ( square symbols ) reactions , are shown in figure 2 for the beam energies of 25 , 33 and 45 mev / nucleon .",
    "the distributions for each element show higher fragment yield for the neutron rich isotopes in @xmath0ar + @xmath1fe reaction ( squares ) , which has the largest neutron - to - proton ratio ( @xmath13 ) , in comparison to the @xmath0ca + @xmath1ni reaction ( stars ) , which has the smallest neutron - to - proton ratio . the yields for the reaction , @xmath0ar + @xmath1fe ( circles ) , which has an intermediate value of the neutron - to - proton ratio , are in between those of the other two reactions .",

    "this is consistent with the prediction of phase coexistence of two conserved charges with isospin dependent interaction of lattice gas calculation @xcite .",
    "the large asymmetry or the strong enrichment of the gas phase can be understood in terms of an isospin dependent interaction between the protons and the neutrons . in the absence of an isospin dependent interaction , the fragments",
    "are populated close to the stability line and have similar @xmath13 ratio s as the initial source . with the inclusion of isospin dependence ,",

    "the fragment distribution is centered closer to the @xmath65 line resulting in a decrease in the asymmetry of the gas phase .",
    "the observed decrease in the relative neutron and proton densities with increasing beam energy may thus be attributed to the decrease in the sensitivity of the isospin effect with increasing temperature .",

    "were those of cold isolated nuclei .",
    "the fragments in their primary stage are usually hot and the properties of hot nuclei ( i.e. , their binding energies and masses ) differ from those of cold nuclei .",
    "if hot fragments in the freeze - out configuration have smaller @xmath79 , their masses at the beginning of the secondary de - excitation will be different , and this effect should be taken into account in the evaporation process . recently ,",

    "they assume a smooth transition to standard experimental masses with shell effects(@xmath94 ) using the following dependence ,    @xmath95    the excitation energy is determined from the energy balance taking into account the mass @xmath96 at the given excitation .",
    "the above corrections were incorporated in the statistical model calculations described in the previous section to study the effect of @xmath79 during the sequential de - excitation of the hot primary fragments .",
    "figure 13 shows the result of the statistical model calculation using the modified secondary de - excitation correction .",
    "the isoscaling parameter @xmath2 is plotted as a function of excitation energy for the two pairs of systems ( left and right column ) .",
    "the top panels show the calculations using symmetry energy value of 25 mev .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the new calculations are not able to reproduce the experimentally determined alpha for both pairs of systems . with decreasing values of the symmetry energy , the calculated @xmath2 values for the ar + ni and ca + ni pair ( left column ) decrease and are in better agreement with the experimental values at @xmath79 = 13 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculated values for the ar + fe and ca + ni reaction pair ( right column ) are in good agreement with the experimental values at @xmath79 = 10 mev . in general",
    ", one observes that the modified version of secondary de - excitation in smm leads to a symmetry energy value of 10 - 13 mev .",
    "this is slightly lower than the value of 15 mev obtained from the standard version of the smm calculation shown in figure 11 .",
    "the dependence of the isoscaling parameter as a function of the symmetry energy for primary and secondary fragments at various excitation energies are as shown in figure 14 .",
    "once again , the difference between the primary fragment @xmath2 and the secondary fragment @xmath2 are extremely small for the ar + ni and ca + ni pair of reaction ( which has the lowest difference in neutron - to - proton ratio ) , and only slightly larger for the ar + fe and ca + ni pair ( which has the highest difference in neutron - to - proton ratio ) . however , the main difference between the dependence shown in figure 12 and 14 is the rate at which the isoscaling parameter @xmath2 decrease with decreasing symmetry energy .",
    "the decrease is much slower in the calculation where the symmetry energy dependence of the mass is taken into account during the secondary de - excitation .",
    "the slower decrease in the isoscaling parameter results in the calculation being able to reproduce the experimental value at a slightly lower value of symmetry energy .",
    "one also observes that the primary fragment @xmath2 in the modified version of the secondary decay calculation are consistently smaller than the secondary fragment @xmath2 at lower symmetry energies .",
    "ar + @xmath1fe reaction at @xmath85 = 6 mev / nucleon .",
    "the left panels correspond to the old and the right to the new de - excitation prescription used in the smm calculation .",
    "the solid and the dashed curves correspond to the calculations using two different values of the symmetry energy.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in order to understand the difference in the symmetry energy , we show in figure 15 , the calculated isotopic yield distribution for the carbon element in @xmath0ar + @xmath1fe reaction at @xmath85 = 6 mev / nucleon .",
    "the figure shows the primary and the secondary yield distribution using two different prescriptions for the secondary de - excitations in smm .",
    "the left column in the figure corresponds to the smm calculations , where the fragment masses used are those of cold isolated nuclei , and the right column corresponds to the smm calculations , where the masses ( symmetry energy ) evolve with their excitation energy during secondary de - excitation .",
    "the panels on the top correspond to the primary yield distribution and those in the bottom to the secondary yield distribution .",
    "the dotted and the solid curves in each panel corresponds to the calculations assuming two different values of the symmetry energy , 15 and 25 mev respectively . from the figure , it is evident that there exist a subtle difference between the two final ( secondary ) distributions , shown by the dotted and the solid curves in the bottom panels .",
    "one also observes that the distribution depends on whether the mass ( symmetry energy ) evolves during the evaporation or not .",
    "the smm calculation with the standard de - excitation ( i.e the old de - excitation ) leads to a narrow final distribution and the isotopes are concentrated close to the @xmath27-stability line .",
    "the difference in the final yield distributions for @xmath79 = 15 mev and @xmath79 = 25 mev is very small .",
    "this difference is however much more pronounced in the new de - excitation calculation .",
    "the final isotope distributions in this case are considerably wider , and shifted toward neutron - rich side . the smm calculation assuming the mass ( symmetry energy ) evolution during the evaporation therefore leads to larger yields for neutron rich fragments .",
    "a similar observation was made by buyukcizmeci _",
    "@xcite in their calculation of the primary and secondary fragment isotopic distributions in @xmath97au , @xmath98sn and @xmath98la systems . by using the experimental masses during the evaporation from the primary fragments ,",
    "the emission of the charged particles are suppressed by the binding energy and the coulomb barrier . in the case of small @xmath79 ,",
    "the binding energy in the beginning of evaporation process essentially favors emission of charged particles .",
    "when the nucleus has cooled down sufficiently to restore the normal symmetry energy , the remaining excitation energy is rather low ( @xmath99 @xmath100 1 mev ) for the nucleus to evaporate many neutrons .",
    "the above comparison of the experimentally observed isoscaling properties with the statistical multifragmentation model shows that , irrespective of the secondary de - excitation , the final fragment distribution depends strongly on the available free energy and the strength of the symmetry energy",
    ". a significantly lower value of the symmetry energy than that assumed for cold isolated nuclei is required to explain the isotopic compositions of the fragments produced in multifragmentation reaction .",
    "the difference between the two kinds of evaporation calculations gives a measure of the uncertainty expected in the present analysis .",
    "the results above indicate that the properties of nuclei produced at high excitation energy , isospin and reduced density could be significantly different from those of the cold isolated nuclei .",
    "such information can provide important inputs for the understanding of the nuclear composition of supernova matter where hot and neutron rich nuclei are routinely produced @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have measured the isotopic yield distribution of the fragments produced in the multifragmentation of @xmath0ar , @xmath0ca + @xmath1fe , @xmath1ni reactions at 25 - 53 mev / nucleon .",
    "the symmetry energy and the isoscaling properties of the fragments produced were studied within the framework of statistical multifragmentation model .",
    "it is observed that the isoscaling parameter @xmath2 for the hot fragments decrease with increasing excitation energy and decreasing symmetry energy .",
    "the @xmath2 values increase with increasing difference in the isospin of the fragmenting system .",
    "similar behavior is also observed for the cold secondary fragments .",
    "the sequential decay of the primary fragments to secondary fragments is observed to have very little influence on the isoscaling parameter as a function of excitation energies and isospin of the fragmenting system .",
    "the symmetry energy however , strongly influences the isospin properties of the hot fragments .",
    "the experimentally determined scaling parameters could be explained by a symmetry energy that is as low as 10 - 15 mev , and significantly lower than that for the normal ( cold ) nuclei at saturation density .",
    "the present results indicate that the isospin properties of the fragments produced at high excitation energy and reduced density in multifragmentation reaction are sensitive to the symmetry energy .",

    "<S> the isoscaling parameters @xmath2 , from the primary ( hot ) and secondary ( cold ) fragment yield distributions , were studied as a function of excitation energy , isospin ( neutron - to - proton asymmetry ) and fragment symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the isoscaling parameter @xmath2 decreases with increasing excitation energy and decreasing symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath2 is also observed to increase with increasing difference in the isospin of the fragmenting system . </S>",
    "<S> the sequential decay of the primary fragments into secondary fragments , when studied as a function of excitation energy and isospin of the fragmenting system , show very little influence on the isoscaling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energy however , has a strong influence on the isospin properties of the hot fragments . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed scaling parameters can be explained by symmetry energy that is significantly lower than that for the ground state nuclei near saturation density . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the properties of hot nuclei at excitation energies , densities and isospin away from the normal ground state nuclei could be significantly different . </S>"
