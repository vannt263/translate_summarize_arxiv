    "massive o and b - type stars are born individually in molecular clouds or collectively within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , which contain substantial amounts of dust . from the collapse and fractionation of the gmc to the final product of a visible star ( or a cluster ) a number of physical processes are occurring .",
    "these include , but are not limited to , the following stages for the _ star _ : rapid accretion , the ( possible ) formation of a disk , slow accretion , the initiation of the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , and normal main sequence evolution . at the same time , but _ not _ with identical timescales , its surrounding _ environment _ is evolving : the molecular hydrogen is dissociated then ionized into a gradually expanding hregion ; the ice mantles of the dust are evaporated , and the natal cocoon expands , lowering its overall density and opacity . for a recent summary of this general topic , the reader is referred to _ the earliest stages of massive star birth _ ( crowther 2002 ) .",
    "the wavelength at which the material becomes optically thin to the stellar radiation shifts to shorter and shorter values from the ir .",
    "the dust in the cocoon and in the surroundings absorbs and reprocesses the stellar radiation and re - emits it in the far and mid ir ( fir  mir ) regions ( from  1 mm down to 10@xmath0 m ) . as this",
    "evolution proceeds , we would expect to _ observe _ the following phenomena for each individual stellar object :    @xmath2 a ` hot core ' phase ( e.g. , kurtz et al . 2000 ) in which a source of ir dust emission surrounding a buried star is found .",
    "the star is sufficiently luminous to heat the dust but it is not ( yet ? ) hot enough to produce sufficient lyman continuum photons .",
    "alternatively , the infalling material is `` quenching '' the formation of an h  region ( e.g. osorio et al . 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath2 the star forms an ultracompact h  ( uchii ) region ( e.g. , churchwell 1999ab ) which can be identified from its free - free radio emission . the ionized hydrogen is surrounded by a natal dust cocoon which radiates in the fir  mir .",
    "@xmath2 the uchii region expands , becoming a compact h   ( ch ) region , as the dust evaporates and the overlying cocoon expands and thins out ( as in , e.g. , w49a  conti & blum 2002 ) .",
    "mir emission gradually diminishes .",
    "@xmath2 the dust becomes optically thin at visible wavelengths .",
    "eventually the star no longer has any surrounding natal material ( e.g. , a disk ) .",
    "we will identify this time as the end of the birth process for an individual massive star .",
    "two key parameters of the birth processes for massive stars are those of the h  region and those of the dust emission .",
    "the former can be estimated from the lyman continuum luminosity , or extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation , which is highly dependent on the stellar temperature ( e.g. smith , norris & crowther 2002 ) ; the latter from the overall stellar luminosity ( primarily the uv radiation ) along with the dust properties ( thickness , extent , and distance from the star ) .",
    "as the birth process goes forward , we would expect both of these parameters to change in response to the stellar evolution and the varying dust in the surrounding cocoon .",
    "the dust emission will undergo the largest change as it responds to the evolution of the environment .",
    "the lyman continuum and the uv luminosity should not change dramatically as once the star `` turns on '' ( at the zams ) as one would expect that substantial accretion will come to a halt ( thus @xmath3 and @xmath4 constant ) . for cases in which the central o star is obscured by hundreds of magnitudes of visual extinction ,",
    "the situation is much simpler at mid - ir wavelengths , where the extinction is several hundred times lower .    until recently ,",
    "there had not been any mir galactic plane surveys of medium spatial resolution resolutions for the @xmath5 m , @xmath6 m , @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m filters , respectively ] .",
    "the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) remedied this situation , with a complete galactic plane survey within @xmath95@xmath10 ( price et al .",
    "2001 ) at 18@xmath11 spatial resolution .",
    "ultimately , the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) will achieve a much higher spatial resolution .",
    "for the moment , however , msx permits the comparison between radio and mir fluxes of almost all known massive star birth sites , so as to better understand the relationship between the h  regions and the dust cocoons . in this paper",
    "we shall begin with a study of a sample of the uchii regions in our galaxy , which are generally believed to be excited by one or a few dominant stars , and ought to represent the simplest cases to investigate .",
    "a subsequent paper will consider our results for h  and giant h  ( gh ) regions .",
    "we begin in section  [ obs ] by outlining the extraction procedure for obtaining mir data from the msx satellite . in section  [ sam ]",
    "we list the sample of uchii objects from the catalogs of wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) and kurtz , churchwell & wood ( 1994 ) that we have studied .",
    "we discuss in section  [ morph ] mir images at 21 @xmath0 m of the uchii regions , and comment on similarities and differences between the objects .",
    "many objects are multiple , with close ( within a few pc ) companions . in some of these , the iras fluxes of the uchii regions will have been affected by the nearby objects , in a few cases drastically so . in section  [ comp ]",
    "we first consider the relationships among the msx medium resolution and iras low resolution data for our sources .",
    "after accounting for the multiplicity of some sources in the iras data , and noting a `` colour '' term in the msx data , we recover the spectral type dependence of the euv to uv fluxes of the sources , as predicted by relatively simple models of uchii regions .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ dis ] .",

    "a well known model of the dust emission from an uchii region ( e.g. , churchwell 1999 ) is spherically symmetric ( 1d ) with two major constituents : the inner ionized hydrogen volume and an outer thick shell of molecular gas and dust .",
    "the outer boundary of the ionized hydrogen region is typically up to 0.1 pc in radius , the surrounding cocoon dust some ten times larger .",
    "the cocoon is optically thick to the visible  uv radiation of the exciting star and is thus heated by it ( kahn 1974 ; osorio et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the dust emission will dominate the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this typically has a broad peak , close to 100@xmath0 m , fortuitously coincident with the long wavelength iras filter .",
    "thermal radiation from the dust cocoon extends from about 1 mm down to a few microns .",
    "this dust is _ not _ at a single temperature but has a broader wavelength distribution than a black body .",
    "most of the dust is at a temperature of about 30k , although some of that nearest the star could be at 100k or more ( see discussion in wolfire & churchwell 1994 ) .",
    "their modelling of the iras seds indicated that the dust density distribution in the shell was more or less constant ( no fall off with radius ) . a more recent study by hatchell et al .",

    "these photons would not produce radio emission and would not be counted when one is trying to infer properties of the star from the h  region . whether this is an important problem for uchii regions",
    "will be discussed below .",
    "we are interested here in the relationship between the ir emission from the dust , which is determined by the stellar luminosity which for hot stars is the uv radiation , and the radio emission of the h  region , which is dependent upon the euv luminosity of the star .",
    "this ratio ought to be spectral type dependent , ranging from @xmath37 for early o type stars to @xmath38 for early b types ( churchwell 1999 )",

    "many of the latter have wildly different fluxes in the msx and iras filters . leaving these outliers aside",
    ", there is no trend of flux ratio with the strength of the mir flux , and the mean ratio ( not log units ) is 2.20@xmath190.46 .",
    "the differences in the iras and msx filter bandwidth alone accounts for a factor of 1.6 ( recall fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the rest is due to the iras filter being somewhat redwards of the msx filter , thus nominally brighter in these red sources . in the following figures we shall concentrate on those objects without bright companions ( filled circles ) although we will show all sources throughout",
    ".    one further note of caution is that for our comparison between msx and radio fluxes , we have limited the mid - ir flux to the spatial resolution of the instrument , such that the total mid - ir flux of extended sources is underestimated .",

    "fir fluxes , corrected to a uniform 10 kpc distance , may serve as a surrogate for the luminosity since nearly all of the stellar radiation has been converted to heating the dust cocoon .",
    "we can measure the color of the cocoon , an indicator of the dust temperature distribution , by obtaining the msx 21@xmath0m/12@xmath0 m flux ratio .",
    "[ fig10 ] presents an mir cmd , namely the msx 21/12@xmath0 m index versus the 21@xmath0 m flux , adjusted to a uniform distance of 10 kpc .",
    "we see a fairly wide scatter along the abscissa suggesting a large range of colours for the dust cocoons .",
    "this indicates that they do not all have the same slopes of the sed on the short wavelength side . the vertical extent ,",
    "of course , represents different luminosities of the dust , thus of the central exciting stars .",
    "we see that there is little if any dependence of the luminosity ( ordinate ) on the color .",
    "thus the dust luminosity and its sed are not correlated .",
    "the color of the dust cocoon will have to be accounted for in detailed modeling of individual sources .",
    "we have considered whether effects other than temperature might affect the 21/12@xmath0 m index , namely nebular contributions and extinction .",
    "many sources are strong emitters in mid - ir fine structure lines of neon and sulphur , of which [ neii ] 12.8@xmath0 m and [ siii ] 18.7@xmath0 m lie in the 12 and 21@xmath0 m filters . from inspection of a range of uchii regions observed with iso / sws ( e.g. g29.9560.016 in fig .",

    "there is increasing evidence in the literature that some lyc photons are finding their way out beyond the uchii region where they ionize the hydrogen found there .",

    "in most cases , the larger aperture leads to a higher radio flux , i.e. the commonly adopted radio fluxes ( dense , ionized components ) provide only a fraction of the total when the less dense , extended surrounding regions are considered .",
