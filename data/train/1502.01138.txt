    "for its remarkable high tensile strength and ductility  @xcite , mg - based long - period stacking ordered ( lpso ) structures are considered as light - weight structural alloy for next generation . in order to clarify relationship between thier formation process and resultant properties in terms of application for structural materials , considerable number of experimental as well as theoretical studies have been carried out .",
    "previous theoretical studies mainly address formation process and thermodynamic stability of mg - based lpso alloy , including ( i ) the tendency of phase separation confirmed by cluster variation method  @xcite , ( ii ) in - plane ordering of clusters consisted of y , zn substitutional atoms  @xcite , and ( iii ) systematic understanding of energetic stability with respect to variety of substitutional atoms into mg - based alloys  @xcite .",
    "although these previous theoretical works partly clarify themodynamic stability of lpso phases , they did not sufficiently discuss about ( i ) relative stability in terms of disordered phases or ( ii ) effect of lattice vibration on stability of lpso .",
    "the former one is considered essentially important , since well - established ordering energy , determining the thermodynamic stability of ordered phase with respect to temperature , is typically reffered to the difference in mixing energy between ordered ( here , lpso ) and disordered phases . for",

    "[ fig:18r ] is a schematic illustration of stacking sequence of 18r lpso structure , which includes mg hcp stacking and y , zn substitutional atom concentrated phase including l1@xmath1 cluster . to systematically evaluate thermodynamic stability of such structures , we need to consider energetics of multiple structures including different stacking sequence",
    "however , most calculations confine the structural model , so calculation that does nt confine experimentally reported structures is highly required .",
    "furthermore , it is fundamentally important to assess thermodynamic stability of lpso phase by competing disordered phase . in this study , based on dft calculation ,",
    "we systematically study thermodynamic stability of lpso structure in terms of disordered phases .",
    "to comprehensively address energetics of multicomponent system with various composition , we need to calculate tremendous number of structures of the system and computational cost therefore become large . in this study",
