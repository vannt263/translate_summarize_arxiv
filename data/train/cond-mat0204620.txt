    "recently barybin and santos  @xcite have applied a spectral approach to the theory of @xmath0-junctions in order to take into account the effect of a large ac signal in a rigorous theoretical manner .",
    "this approach is based on the general diffusion  drift equations for injected minority carriers , which is a standard practice for semiconductor electronics .",
    "the only specific feature distinguishing our approach from others is related to the initial representation of desired carrier concentrations in the form of fourier expansion over frequency harmonics .",
    "such harmonics are produced by nonlinear processes in @xmath0-junctions when a sufficiently large ac voltage amplitude @xmath1 is applied to the junction together with the dc bias voltage @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "spectra of both the excess concentration of injected carriers and the external circuit current have been derived ( see formulas ( 25 ) , ( 26 ) , and ( 32 ) of paper  @xcite ) .",
    "the use of appropriate terms in fourier series has given rise to new expressions for the dc component @xmath3 and ac component @xmath4 of the external circuit current which determine the static current ",
    "voltage characteristic @xmath5 and the dynamic admittance @xmath6 .",
    "they have both proved to be dependent not only on @xmath2 but also on @xmath1 , in the case of nonlinear ( in ac signal ) regime of operation of the @xmath0-junction .    below we shall experimentally verify the novel theoretical result concerning a dependence of the dynamic admittance on the amplitude of applied ac voltage @xmath7 .",
    "this dependence was missed by other authors beginning with shockley s original papers  @xcite .",
    "they all assume that the amplitude of the ac voltage is much smaller than @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this approximation is also used in popular books such as  @xcite .",
    "the basic model of a diode admittance is a parallel combination of the conductance @xmath10 and capacitance @xmath11 .",
    "based on the old theory , the dynamic admittance of the @xmath0-diode is derived in the form  @xcite @xmath12 with the following _ old _ expressions for the diffusion conductance and capacitance : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the minority carrier lifetime , and @xmath16 is an operating frequency of the applied ac voltage @xmath17 .",
    "expressions  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and  ( [ eq:3 ] ) are valid for the @xmath18-structures with a highly doped @xmath19-emitter when @xmath20 and the low - frequency diffusion conductance @xmath21 and capacitance @xmath22 are equal to  [ 5 ] @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diffusion length for holes with the equilibrium concentration @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a cross - section area of the diode .",
    "considering the low injection theory and applying the spectral solution approach , we have found that for arbitrary applied voltage levels expressions  ( [ eq:2 ] ) and  ( [ eq:3 ] ) should be modified to the following _ new _ form ( see eqs .",
    "( 48 ) and ( 49 ) of paper  [ 1 ] ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 so that instead of the old expression ( [ eq:1 ] ) for the dynamic admittance we have a new one : @xmath29    as follows from these formulas , the new diffusion conductance and capacitance depend not only on the frequency  @xmath16 given by the old formulas ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) but also on the ac voltage amplitude @xmath17 appearing in the modified bessel function of first order @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . in the low - frequency limit when @xmath32 , equations ( [ eq:2])([eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:5])([eq:6 ] ) reduce to the following normalized quantities : @xmath33    at low signal amplitudes when @xmath34 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) is approximately equal to 1 , which is the result usually found in the literature ( see , e.  g. , formulas ( 64)(66 ) and fig .  23 of book  [ 5 ] ) .",
    "based on the new theory , even at zero bias it is possible to get experimental evidence of the dynamic behavior predicted by formula  ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "our objective is to investigate a dependence of the new diffusion conductance on the ac voltage amplitude , @xmath35 , at low frequencies and zero bias .",
    "although the diffusion capacitance @xmath36 can also be measured , we shall not considered it here because at zero bias the total capacitance is dominated by the depletion capacitance . below we present the experimental results obtained from conductance measurements to corroborate the new large - signal theory of @xmath0-junctions  [ 1 ] .",
    "our theory developed in paper  [ 1 ] is based on the ideal shockley model of the abrupt @xmath0-junction with neglecting generation ",
    "recombination processes in the depletion layer  [ 3 ] .",
    "but in practice , such processes may be important for the actual @xmath0-diodes employed below in our experiment .",
    "so they have to be taken into account at least phenomenologically , as suggested by sze  [ 5 ] .",
    "let us follow him and correct our theoretical results by an empirical factor @xmath37 which is introduced so as to provide the following replacement : @xmath38    values of the factor @xmath37 lie between 1 and 2 : @xmath39 when a contribution of the generation ",
    "recombination processes is negligibly small , and @xmath40 if the recombination current dominates over the diffusion one  [ 5 ] .    by using the replacement ( [ eq:9 ] ) ,",
    "expression ( [ eq:8 ] ) for the low - frequency dynamic conductance can be rewritten in the following corrected form : @xmath41 where the correcting function @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43    in general , the modified quantity @xmath44 in expression ( [ eq:11 ] ) takes into account not only a contribution from the generation ",
    "recombination processes by means of the factor @xmath37 but also that from a priori unknown temperature @xmath45 of a @xmath0-junction under experimental investigation .",
    "hence , the product @xmath46 can be used as a fitting parameter to adjust the theoretical relations ( [ eq:10])([eq:11 ] ) with experimental results obtained below .",
    "the correcting function @xmath42 expressed by formula  ( [ eq:11 ] ) is plotted in fig .  1 for @xmath47k and five values of the fitting parameter @xmath48 , and 2.0 .",
    "to verify our theory , we built a simple apparatus using a dual - phase dsp lock - in amplifier , stanford research systems model sr830 , and a low noise electrometer grade operational amplifier , burr - brown opa128jm ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the operational amplifier is in the inverter configuration .",
    "the ac voltage from the lock - in amplifier is directly applied to the diode with no bias , and the output of the amplifier is connected directly to the lock - in .",
    "the lock - in amplifier has two displays  x and y which give the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of output signal at the excitation frequency @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to show that the lock - in output in the x and y displays is equal to @xmath49 , \\label{eq:12}\\ ] ] @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq:13}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is a feedback resistor , @xmath52 is the rms value of the lock - in oscillator voltage ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 is the internal phase of the lock - in oscillator signal connected to the phase detector , and @xmath55 is the phase of the lock - in oscillator signal after passing through an external circuit . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) it follows that the two displays are @xmath56 out of phase from each other .    to get correct experimental values ,",
    "it is necessary to adjust a phase @xmath54 of the lock - in local oscillator so that the x - display would be used for the conductance voltage @xmath57 and the y - display for the capacitance voltage @xmath58 . as follows from expressions  ( [ eq:12 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) , it can be realized only if @xmath59 .",
    "the phase @xmath54 is adjusted with a reference capacitor @xmath60 which is placed between the local oscillator and the minus input of the operational amplifier instead of diode  @xmath61 , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the phase adjustment is carried out until zero voltage is observed in the conductance x - display , i.  e. , when @xmath59 .",
    "then eqs .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) yield the required results : @xmath62    after the adjustment , the reference capacitor @xmath60 is replaced by a measured diode @xmath61 and the measurements are performed by varying the applied ac voltage .",
    "the operating frequency of the lock - in internal oscillator was chosen 1khz to surely provide the relation @xmath63 underlying the initial theoretical expression  ( [ eq:8 ] ) . to extract the conductance",
    ", one must normalize the data .    for our experiments",
    "we have employed two different diodes  the 1n914b , a common high frequency diode , and the 1n4007 , a diode used in power applications such as power supplies .",
    "all resistors and capacitors used in the experiment were measured with the stanford research systems model sr720 lcr meter .",
    "the measurement error is found to be below @xmath64 .",
    "the experimental results for two above - mentioned diodes are presented in figs .  3 and  4 .",
    "as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) , the low - voltage measurements ( when @xmath65 ) give values of the low - frequency diffusion conductance @xmath21 defined by formula ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "these values have proved to be equal @xmath66mho for the 1n914b diode and @xmath67mho for the 1n4007 diode .    from the experimental curves plotted in figs .  3 and  4 it follows that the modified factor @xmath68 should be equal to 20.6 for the 1n914b diode and 20.1 for the 1n4007 diode in order to fit the theoretical expression  ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "hence , the fitting parameter @xmath46 is respectively equal to 560k and 574k , which for the operating temperature @xmath69k provides the following values of the generation  recombination factor @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , both the diodes operate in a regime when the recombination current slightly dominates over the diffusion current .",
    "application of a spectral approach to the charge carrier transport in @xmath19-@xmath37-junctions with an arbitrary signal amplitude has allowed us to obtain new results which were previously lost by all the authors .",
