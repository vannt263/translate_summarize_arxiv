    "quantization of such a model in the coordinate representation leads to the schroedinger equation in finite differences .",
    "the shift in the argument is along imaginary axis which has very important consequences .",
    "one of them is that the wave functions which are the solutions to such an equation should be analytical functions on the appropriate riemannian surface .    in the ordinary quantum mechanics we are dealing with the second order differential equations .",

    "in @xcite it was the analyticity requirement that enabled us to find the mass spectrum in the limit of large black holes .",

    "let the function @xmath111 be holomorphic in a region @xmath112 . then in accordance with cauchy theorem @xcite equation ( [ schr ] ) has a solution regular in @xmath113 .",
    "we look for the approximate solutions of ( [ schr ] ) in the form of quasiclassical ansatze @xmath114 then substituting ( [ ansatze ] ) in ( [ schr ] ) we obtain in zero order on @xmath115 the hamilton - jacobi equation on @xmath116 : @xmath117 if @xmath118 in the neighborhood @xmath119 of some point @xmath120 then ( [ hj ] ) has two solutions corresponding to the two different branches of the function @xmath121 : @xmath122 and @xmath123    the coefficients of ( [ schr ] ) are analytical functions in the neighborhood of @xmath120 .",

    "the approximate expression ( [ ccc ] ) for the wave function is valid only in a certain sector @xmath129 in the neighborhood of @xmath120 .",

    "the explanation for the fact that the quasiclassical ansatze fails to be the correct approximation for the regular solution is that the coefficients @xmath148 ( [ ccc ] ) of expansion of the wave function on the system of solutions @xmath149 are different in the sectors * 1,2 * and * 3*. this fact was observed for the first time by stokes and the phenomenon is called the stokes phenomenon @xcite .",

    "<S> phys.rev._ , * d57 * , 1118 ( 1998 ) that consists of the selfgravitating dust shell . </S>",
    "<S> the schroedinger equation for this model is a finite difference equation with the shift of the argument along the imaginary axis . solving this equation in quasiclassical limit in complex domain leads to quantization conditions that define discrete quasiclassical mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> one of the quantization conditions is bohr - sommerfeld condition for the bound motion of the shell . </S>",
    "<S> the other comes from the requirement that the wave function is unambiguously defined on the riemannian surface on which the coefficients of schroedinger equation are regular . </S>",
    "<S> the second quantization condition remains valid for the unbound motion of the shell as well , and in the case of a collapsing null - dust shell leads to @xmath0 spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> resubmision to physical review d    manuscript code : dt6378 originally from : aneronov@mech.math.msu.su    figure updates : postscript figures included in this electronic submission    details of changes : 1 . </S>",

    "<S> fractions within fractions in formulas are removed almost everywhere in accordance with referees requirement , except for the expressions on pages 29 , 30 and 31 which describe the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is because in this unchanged ( although not very nice - looking ) form they are easily identified with expressions for spectrum obtained in phys.rev.d57,1118(1998 ) and i d like it to be clear </S>",

    "<S> the text has minor corrections in order to correspond to the reduced number of figures .    </S>",
    "<S> response to recommendations and criticisms : thank you very much for your kind letter and good assessment to my work . the remarks that you made consern the form and not the essence of the paper , </S>",
    "<S> so i have corrected the text and reduced number of figures following the recommendations made by referee .    </S>",
