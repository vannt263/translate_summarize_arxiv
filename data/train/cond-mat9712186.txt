    "as first conjectured by janssen and grassberger @xcite , many numerical and analytical studies have established clearly that all the systems exhibiting a continuous transition into an _",
    "unique _ absorbing state , without any other extra symmetry or conservation law , belong into the same universality class , namely , that of the contact process ( cp ) @xcite . that conjecture has been extended to include multicomponent systems @xcite , and also systems with an infinite number of absorbing states @xcite . among many other models in this broad class",
    "are the following : directed percolation @xcite , the contact process @xcite , catalytic reactions on surfaces @xcite , the spreading of epidemics , and branching annihilating random walks @xcite . the reggeon field theory ( rft )",
    "is the minimal continuous theory capturing the key features of this universality class @xcite , ( which is often referred to as directed percolation ( dp hereafter ) universality class ) .    despite of its theoretical importance",
    ", no experiment has succeeded so far in identifying critical exponents compatible with the predicted dp values",
    ". this could be due to the fact that real systems are never pure , i.e , they present impurities , dilution or other forms of disorder .",
    "the question arises of how disorder affects the critical behavior of dp - like systems .",
    "that problem was first posed by kinzel @xcite and studied numerically by noest @xcite who showed using a harris criterium @xcite that quenched disorder changes the critical behavior of dp systems in spatial dimensions below @xmath0 .",
    "he also demonstrated that in @xmath1 generic power law ( generic scale invariance ) can be observed , and that in @xmath2 a griffiths - like phase @xcite can appear when the impurities take the form of dilution @xcite . this same problem has been recently tackled by dickman and moreira in an interesting series of papers @xcite where they have pointed out the presence of logarithmic time - dependences in @xmath2 and a possible violation of scaling .    in any case , the dynamics in impure dp - systems is well established to be extremely slow : due to the presence of impurities , a system that globally is in the absorbing phase , can include regions that take locally parameter values that correspond to the active regime in the analogous pure system .",
    "the presence of these zones makes it difficult for the system to relax to the absorbing state , and consequently it decays in a slow fashion : i.e , exhibiting power laws in @xmath1 @xcite , and logarithmicly in @xmath2 @xcite , but not exponentially as generically occurs in pure systems away from the critical point .    the problem of temporally disordered systems with absorbing states has also been recently investigated , with apparently striking conclusions @xcite .",
    "at a theoretical level a field - theory analysis for this class of impure systems has recently been derived by janssen @xcite .",
    "his works corrects a previous incomplete analysis @xcite , and concludes from an epsilon expansion around the upper critical dimension , @xmath0 , that the renormalization group flow equations exhibit only runaway trajectories , and therefore there is no stable ( perturbative ) fixed point ( nothing can be concluded about non - perturbative fixed points ) .",
    "this can be seen as an evidence that no universal critical behavior is expected in this class of models .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the impure one - dimensional problem , and look at it within a new perspective .",
    "in particular , we analyze the presence or absence of scaling laws in analogy with the two - dimensional results recently presented by dickman and moreira , study the universality of critical exponents and the scaling relations they obey , and verify the presence of a sublinear regime predicted by bramson et al .",
    "on the other hand , we present a non - markovian representation of this class of systems that shows the same phenomenology , and derive from it a field theory that turns out to be equivalent to the one derived by janssen . from the field theory",
    "we obtain new relations among exponents .",
    "in the standard contact process @xcite each site of a d - dimensional lattice is either occupied or vacant. in its discrete - time version , an occupied site is extracted randomly at each time step ; it generates an offspring with probability @xmath3 , or disappears with complementary probability @xmath4 .",
    "the offspring occupies a randomly chosen nearest neighbor : if it was empty it becomes occupied , while the system remains unchanged if the neighbor was already occupied . in the disordered contact process the probability @xmath3 changes from site to site ,",
    "is fixed in time , and is extracted from a distribution @xmath5 . through this paper we consider in particular : @xmath6",
    "for which @xmath7 in this way @xmath8 acts as a control parameter . for large values of @xmath8 ,",
    "the creation probability is large , and the system is in the active phase .",
    "contrarily , for sufficiently small values of @xmath3 the system decays into the absorbing state .",
    "we have chosen the previous distribution for technical reasons : it simplifies the application of the run time statistic @xcite that we employ to study the model .",
    "the central magnitudes , usually considered in this kind of systems are of two types : magnitudes measured in analysis with homogeneous initial conditions , and those measured studying the spreading of a localized seed into the otherwise empty space @xcite .    in the first group ,",
    "we determine the stationary order parameter ( defined as the average density of particles in the stationary state ) , @xmath9 , the correlation time , @xmath10 , and the correlation length , @xmath11 .    in the second group",
    "we study : the total number of occupied sites in the lattice ( averaged over all the runs including those which have reached the absorbing state ) as a function of time , @xmath12 , the overall surviving probability @xmath13 , that is , the probability that the system has not reached the absorbing state at time @xmath14 , and the mean square distance of spreading from the origin of the surviving trials as a function of time , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "right at the critical point of pure systems , we have : @xmath16 and at a small distance @xmath17 from the critical point , @xmath18 which define the set of critical exponents we are interested in . in pure systems",
    "the following scaling relations hold :    @xmath19    some of these expressions have to be modified for the disordered model as we will show ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we start our analysis of the model by mapping it into a non - markovian model .",
    "the idea of representing a model with quenched disorder by means of an effective non - markovian equation , i.e. , with memory , including no disorder , is not a new one .",
    "a complete theory for doing so has been developed in @xcite : it has been named the run time statistic ( rts ) , and has proven to be an useful tool in the study of fractals with quenched disorder @xcite , and self - organized models with extremal dynamics @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the rts can be exemplified by its application to the random random walker ( rrw ) @xcite .",
    "the rrw is defined in the following way : a standard one - dimensional random walker is considered , with the only difference that the probabilities of jumping to the right , @xmath20 , or to the left , @xmath21 , change from site to site , are quenched , and extracted from a certain probability distribution @xmath22 . the probability that at a given site , characterized by a given value of @xmath20 , visited @xmath9 times by the walker , the walker has jumped @xmath23 times to the left is given by the binomial distribution : @xmath24 using the bayes inversion formula for the inversion of conditional probabilities one can calculate the probability that at a given site the probability @xmath20 takes a particular value between @xmath20 and @xmath25 from the knowledge of @xmath23 after @xmath9 jumps @xcite @xmath26 an effective transition probability can be accordingly defined as : @xmath27 this equation gives the effective probability for the walker to jump to the right in its @xmath28 visit to a given site , conditioned to the fact that in @xmath9 previous visits it jumped @xmath23 times to the right .",
    "observe that the distribution eq.([pcond ] ) changes with time ( with @xmath9 ) ; the information about the history of the system is contained in the effective transition probabilities ( that change from site to site ) .",
    "this is usually called _ run time statistic _ @xcite .",
    "let us now apply the previously described method to the disordered contact process .",
    "at each site the value of @xmath3 ( that plays now a role analogous to @xmath20 in the rrw ) , is extracted from the distribution eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) @xcite ; it is straightforward to verify that @xmath29 where now : n is the number of times that a given site has been chosen to try an evolution step , and @xmath23 is the total number of times in which an offspring has been generated ( obviously @xmath30 is the number of events in which the site has become empty ) .",
    "therefore the effective parameter @xmath3 at the site under consideration is : @xmath31 note that the distribution of effective values of the probability @xmath32 for any arbitrary @xmath9 as large as wanted does not collapse to a delta function , but converges asymptotically to the distribution ( [ prob1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "using the previously derived non - markovian approach we can easily derive an associate field theory .",
    "let us first consider the standard reggeon field theory describing the universality class of the pure contact process @xcite .",
    "@xmath33= \\int dr^d \\int_0^\\infty dt \\left [ \\lambda \\psi(x , t)^2 \\phi(x , t ) -\\psi(x , t )   \\left ( \\partial_t \\phi - \\mu^2 \\phi - \\lambda \\phi(x , t)^2 -\\nabla^2 \\phi(x , t ) \\right ) \\right ] . \\label{rft}\\ ] ] the coefficient of the linear term , @xmath34 ( the _ mass _ in a field theoretical language ) , depends linearly on the creation probability @xmath3 .",
    "a large @xmath3 renders the contact process supercritical , and so does a value of @xmath34 above its critical value .",
    "observe that at any time the renormalized value of @xmath34 at a given point @xmath35 is given by the expectation value of @xmath36 . in order to implement the dependence of p on the history at each point @xmath35",
    ", we can perform the following substitution : @xmath37 that is , at every time step , the _ modified _ value of the linear coefficient , @xmath38 , is given by its original value corrected by a time dependent term : the expectation value of @xmath39 over the previous history of the system .",
    "observe that @xmath40 acts as a normalization factor . in this way",
    "the action becomes : @xmath41=   \\int dr^d \\int_0^\\infty dt [ \\lambda \\psi^2 \\phi ) -\\psi ( \\partial_t \\phi - \\mu^2 \\phi - \\lambda   \\phi^2   -\\nabla^2 \\phi )   +   \\gamma   \\psi \\phi \\int_0^t d \\tau   \\psi(x , \\tau ) \\phi(x , \\tau ) ] \\label{rft2}\\ ] ] where the dependence of the fields on @xmath35 and @xmath14 has been omitted for the economy of notation .    on the other hand considering the standard reggeon field theory , eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) , with a site - dependent quenched mass coefficient , @xmath42 , and a gaussian distribution of masses with mean @xmath34 , and variance @xmath43 , one gets after averaging over the disorder ( for what one just has to perform a gaussian integral @xcite @xmath44=\\int dr^d \\left [   \\int_0^\\infty dt \\left [ \\lambda \\psi^2 \\phi -\\psi ( \\partial_t \\phi - \\mu^2 \\phi - \\lambda \\phi^2   -\\nabla^2 \\phi ) \\right ] \\right ]    + f   \\left [ \\int_0^\\infty dt \\psi(x , t ) \\phi(x , t ) \\right]^2 . \\label{j1}\\ ] ] observe that eq .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) coincides with eq . ( [ rft2 ] ) except for a time integration limit and the value of the coefficients .",
    "this difference states that the non - markovian approach reproduces the exact result in the large time limit .",
    "such a difference between the two field theories can be argued to be irrelevant .",
    "naive power counting arguments show that all the three non - linearities in eq .",
    "( [ rft2 ] ) can be renormalized in @xmath0 .",
    "this result is consistent with the harris criterium @xcite presented by kinzel and noest in @xcite , which states that quenched spatial disorder affects the critical behavior of the contact process and models in the same universality class below @xmath0 .    the detailed renormalization procedure of eq .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) can be found in @xcite , where it is concluded that no stable fixed point exits below @xmath0 .",
    "this result is found performing an epsilon expansion around the critical dimension , and is , therefore , valid only in a perturbative sense .",
    "the implication of this fact is that either there is a strong coupling fixed point , or there is no fixed point at all .",
    "this latter possibility could reveal the presence of discontinuous transitions ( that have never been observed numerically ) or , in any case , a lack of universality .",
    "more rigorous conclusions are not available at this point from the field theoretical analysis .",
    "the field theory we have written down can also be used as a starting point to derive scaling relations . from eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) ( or using other standard scaling arguments ) , it is easy to derive that in the active regime : @xmath45 let us derive it analogous for the impure ( non - markovian ) model here using simple arguments : as @xmath12 is obtained averaging over all the runs , it can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total number of particles calculated averaging only over surviving runs .",
    "consequently , one gets , @xmath48 . after creating a perturbation ,",
    "if a growing cluster of occupied sites is generated , the radius of such a cluster grows as @xmath49 and its volume as @xmath50 . from the two previous expressions , the density of particles inside the cluster goes like @xmath51 .",
    "but this density inside the cluster scales as @xmath52 by definition of @xmath53 , therefore we have obtained eq .",
    "( [ sr1 ] ) .",
    "the previous expression is valid only at the critical point in the pure model , where scale invariance is expected .",
    "contrarily in the impure model , where generic scale invariance is expected , the previous argument is valid in all the active phase , in which growing clusters are typically generated from localized seeds .    on the other hand , in the absorbing phase ,",
    "typically initial seeds are located in locally absorbing regions and die out exponentially . however , there is a probability for the initial seed of landing in a locally active cluster . when the perturbation gets out of these clusters dies out exponentially fast . but inside these finite clusters the local stationary density is reached in a finite time . therefore we can substitute formally @xmath53 by zero in eq .",
    "( [ sr1 ] ) and get : @xmath54 ( note that this does not mean that @xmath53 is zero ) .",
    "on the other hand using the symmetry of the lagrangean under the exchange of the fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 it is not difficult to get @xmath57 as in the pure model ( see @xcite for a review of the underlying ideas ) . observe that the previous symmetry , present in the reggeon field theory , is not broken by the introduction of the non - markovian term , i.e. by the quenched impurities .",
    "therefore : @xmath58 in the active regime of our model , as well as in the critical point of the pure model .    in the active phase , starting from an homogeneous distribution the system relaxes to its stationary state also as a power law . by definition of the active regime",
    "the surviving probability does not go to zero for large times , and as @xmath13 is a monotonously decreasing function of time , we get that @xmath59 all along the active phase . using the scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ sr3 ] ) we also get @xmath60 .",
    "this simplifies eq .",
    "( [ sr4 ] ) to @xmath61    for completeness let us point out that the exponent @xmath62 calculated in @xcite is easily found to be related to the exponents we have defined by @xmath63 for that it is enough to observe that @xmath62 is the exponent of a time integral of the total number of particles averaged over the surviving runs .",
    "summing up the main conclusions of this section are :    * in the active phase : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "* in the absorbing phase : @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we have performed extensive monte carlo simulations of the contact process with quenched impurities distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) , as well as of the associated non - markovian contact process defined by eqs .",
    "( [ md ] ) and ( [ md2 ] ) .",
    "spreading experiments have been performed in lattices large enough so the occupied region does not reach the system limits .",
    "experiments started with a random homogeneous initial condition have been performed in system sizes up to @xmath68 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "most of the results presented in what follows correspond to @xmath69 . at every time step a particle is randomly chosen and the dynamics proceeds in the way explained in the model definition section ; after each step the time variable @xmath14 is increased in @xmath70 ; i.e. when all the particles are updated once on average , the time increases in one unit .",
    "simulations are run long enough as to let the system relax to its stationary state in the active phase ( @xmath71 time steps ) .",
    "the different magnitudes are obtained by averaging over many independent runs ( from @xmath72 for large values of @xmath32 , where most realizations die at late times and we can easily collect a good statistics , to @xmath73 for small values of @xmath32 , where many realizations die at early times ) .",
    "all the forthcoming discussions are valid for both the model with quenched disorder and the non - markovian equivalent model : the results are identical within the numerical accuracy . in fact , as it is shown in fig .",
    "1 , the long time distribution of values of @xmath32 in the non - markovian model is verified to converge to the distribution in the quenched model , eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) . to avoid repetition we discuss both cases as a whole , and present figures for both the disordered and the non - markovian model .",
    "the main results we have obtained are the following :      the density of particles @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) decays in time as shown in fig.2 .",
    "observe that for large enough values of @xmath32 the curves converge to a stationary value , that is , their derivative with respect to time converges to zero asymptotically . on the other hand for small values of @xmath32 the curves decay like power laws with non - universal exponents that depends on @xmath32 ; @xmath76 . in fig.3",
    "we show the asymptotic exponent @xmath77 as a function of @xmath32 , for both the disordered and the non - markovian model .",
    "observe that it decays continuously from its maximum value in the absorbing state to a very small value ( compatible with zero ) , and it is zero in the active regime .",
    "observe also the difficulty to locate accurately the critical point .",
    "usualy , i.e. in pure systems , @xmath74 decays exponentially in the absorbing phase , converges to a constant in the active phase ; and decays as a power law only at the critical point .",
    "consequently there is a neat criterium to identify the critical point : power laws are the hall - mark of criticality . in the impure model , instead , the generic presence of power laws makes the determination of the critical point a more delicate issue , but at the same time a more irrelevant one .",
    "two possible scenarios are compatible with the data we have obtained : in the first one @xmath77 is a continuous function of @xmath32 and the point in which it touches zero for the first time corresponds to the critical point .",
    "the second possibility is that there is a discontinuous jump at the critical point ; i.e. the curves in fig .",
    "3 would not be continuous ; that would imply a non - zero value of @xmath53 at the transition point . even though from our numerics it is not possible to resolve the previous dilemma , we are tempted to conclude that the first possibility is the right one , based on the small values of @xmath77 we measure in the vicinity of the critical point , and to the fact that the slopes are always observed to change smoothly with @xmath32 , therefore , no jump is expected to occur . in any case , from the numerics @xmath53 can be expressed at the critical point as @xmath78 , with @xmath79 ( see below ) .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the asymptotic density @xmath9 as a function of @xmath32 , together with a power law fit .",
    "the best fit is obtained taking @xmath80 for the critical effective parameter , and gives @xmath81 for both the disordered and the non - markovian model . in fig .",
    "5 we check the consistence of our assumption on @xmath82 , by representing in a log - log plot @xmath83 as a function of @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "the extrapolation to zero of @xmath83 gives @xmath86 , consistent with our previous assumption .",
    "observe that the value of @xmath87 we find is very different from the one obtained by noest for a different distribution of impurities , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we interpret this fact as a consequence of the absence of universality predicted by the field theory analysis .    from the previous analysis ( which agrees perfectly with the theoretical predictions )",
    "we can extract the following striking conclusion : as @xmath87 assumes a finite value and @xmath53 is compatible with zero , using the scaling relation @xmath89 we get that either @xmath90 is infinity or takes an extremely large value .",
    "observe that noest measured @xmath91 @xcite which is an atypically large value .",
    "in fact , an analogous result has been obtained in the two - dimensional version of the model @xcite ; dickman and moreira showed that as a matter of fact the exponent @xmath90 is not even defined .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the fact that the correlation functions do not decay exponentially in the absorbing phase , but as power laws , i.e , there is no associated characteristic time , and therefore @xmath90 is undefined ( or formally @xmath92 ) .    in order to further explore this issue",
    "we have measured the two - time correlation functions , @xmath93 , for large times and different values of @xmath32 for the disordered model .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "first we observe that in all the cases , i.e. above , below and at the critical point , we get power law behaviors , therefore there is no characteristic time scale .",
    "second , for a fixed value of @xmath32 and varying @xmath94 we observe different transient regimes but the asymptotic behavior does not depend on @xmath94 for large enough times .",
    "this is a prove that the model does not exhibits aging @xcite ; therefore even though the field theory representing the model is non - markovian ( i.e. , the two - time correlation functions can not be expressed only as a function of the time difference ) , the system relaxes to an aging - free state .",
    "this analysis can be interpreted as further supporting the guess that @xmath60 at the critical point .",
    "otherwise , using the scaling relations , we would get a finite @xmath90 and consequently an exponential decay of the two - time correlation function .      in fig .",
    "7,8 and 9 we present the evolution of the magnitudes defined in eq .",
    "( [ expo ] ) for the spreading experiments , while in tables 1 and 2 we give a summary of the values of all the scaling exponents for the magnitudes we have studied , including the exponent @xmath53 , related to homogeneous initial conditions , together with a checking of the scaling relations between the exponents .",
    "observe that the three magnitudes @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 present generic power law decays . in table 1",
    "we show the values of the associated exponents @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for different values of @xmath32 . note that all the scaling laws predicted in the previous section are satisfied generically within the accuracy limits . in particular , observe that right at the critical point and in the active phase we get a value of @xmath96 compatible with @xmath59 , and therefore satisfying the predicted scaling relation : @xmath98 . as a byproduct",
    "we obtain a confirmation of a result obtained some time ago by bramson et al .",
    "@xcite . they demonstrated that an impure version of the one - dimensional contact process exhibits an intermediate phase , i.e. , a region in the active phase in which @xmath99 grows slower that @xmath100 .",
    "this is accordingly called the _ sublinear regime _ @xcite .",
    "we observe sublinear growth in all the active phase : only in the limit @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) we get linear growth : the intermediate phase covers the whole active phase .",
    "therefore the presence of such a sublinear regime seems to be a generic feature of impure one - dimensional systems with absorbing states .",
    "our results could be compared with those obtained by noest for a different impurity distribution .",
    "he got , at the critical point , @xmath103 , which using eq .",
    "( [ sr6 ] ) , implies @xmath104 , to be compared with the value @xmath105 that we measure ( tabb .",
    "[ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] ) . on the other hand for @xmath97 noest measured @xmath106 ( using the relation @xmath107 ) , and we get @xmath108 , indicating again a high degree of non - universality ( tabb .",
    "[ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] ) .    as a last observation we want to point out that the curves for @xmath109 in the absorbing phase ( see fig .",
    "9 ) do not seem to have reached their stationary value in the time scale under consideration .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath97 we give in the tables must be taken carefully , since the error bars on @xmath97 are quite large .",
    "in fact , our results seem compatible with @xmath110 , asymptotically .",
    "observe also , that the combination @xmath111 in the absorbing phase gives a small exponent that could also be compatible with zero asymptotically .    in any case",
    ", all the predicted scaling relations among exponents are perfectly satisfied at , above and below the critical point .",
    "we have studied under different perspectives the disordered contact process .",
    "first we have mapped it into a pure model with memory , that reproduces all the phenomenology of the original model . from this new non - markovian model",
    "we write down a simple field theory , that is in the same universality class as one presented previously for the model with gaussian - distributed quenched disorder . using the field theory",
    "we have derived a set of scaling relations not only at the critical point but also in the active and absorbing phases where scale invariance is also observed .",
    "our theoretical predictions are confirmed in extensive monte carlo simulations : in particular we have shown the equivalence of the disordered and the non - markovian model , the generic presence of scale invariance , the existence of a sublinear - growth regime , verified the absence of a characteristic time scale , and verified all the predicted scaling laws .    in a future work we plan to further exploit the mapping into the non - markovian model to obtain some other analytical results . in particular , we pretend to apply real - space renormalization methods to the one - dimensional model , and try to understand the generic scale invariance from a renormalization perspective .",
