    "dark energy , or a mysterious force propelling the universe , is one of the deepest mysteries in all of science .",
    "this mysterious force now thought to account for about 73% of the density of the entire universe  @xcite came to many s surprise in 1998 , when the supernova cosmology project and the high - z supernova search teams  @xcite independently announced their discovery that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating .",
    "one possible source of this late - time cosmic acceleration is a form of energy known as the einstein s cosmological constant @xmath0 - a vacuum energy of empty space , which acts like a perfect fluid with an equation of state @xmath13 .    in physics",
    ", it may be true that we do not have to go around a very complicated ( cosmological ) model to explain the concurrent universe . by somehow consistent with this idea ,",
    "it has often been argued by many that the mysterious dark energy we see today may well be the manifestation of the einstein s cosmological constant .",
    "however , although appealing , this simplest explanation is in blatant contradiction with all known calculations of zero - point ( vacuum ) energy in quantum field theories  @xcite .",
    "no theoretical model , not even the most sophisticated , such as supersymmetry or string theory  @xcite , is able to explain the presence of a small positive cosmological constant in the amount that our observations require  @xcite , @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 is to be interpreted as the present - day dark energy density , then the most pressing issue would be an understanding of why @xmath16 is fifteen orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale ( @xmath17 ) - the energy domain of major elementary particles in standard model physics , and also why @xmath18 now .",
    "needless to say , that the most popular alternative to the cosmological constant , which uses a dynamical scalar field @xmath19 with a suitably defined scalar field potential @xmath20  @xcite , predicts a small ( but still an appreciable ) deviation from the central prediction of einstein s cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "also , the models of holographic dark energy  @xcite and agegraphic dark energy  @xcite , which both appear to be consistent with quantum kinematics , in the sense that these models obey the heisenberg type uncertainty relation , predict a time - varying dark energy equation of state , @xmath22 .",
    "the cosmological observations only suggest that @xmath23 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . clearly , there remains the possibility that the gravitational vacuum energy is fundamentally variable . in this letter",
    "we discuss about this possibility in a framework of the model of ` agegraphic ' dark energy recently proposed by cai  @xcite . by adopting the viewpoint that the standard scalar field models are effective theories of an underlying theory of dark energy",

    "based on an intuitive idea developed by c. mead in 1960s and its generalization by krolyhzy  @xcite , ng and van dam  @xcite , maziashvili  @xcite , sasakura  @xcite and others , cai recently proposed a model of dark energy , which he called agegraghic  @xcite . in this proposal ,",

    "this idea per se is not totally new ; many cosmological models which involve discussion of a time - varying vacuum energy either predict or demand similar scaling solutions .",
    "although the expression  ( [ quantum - cc ] ) is based on a limit on the accuracy of quantum measurements  @xcite , or thought experiments , it can also be motivated by various field theoretic arguments , see , e.g.  @xcite . according to  @xcite the total quantum fluctuations in the geometry of space - time can be non - negligible ( as compared to the critical mass - energy density of the universe ) when one measures them on long distances , like the present linear size of our universe !    what may be particularly interesting in cai s discussion  @xcite is that one may take the cosmic time @xmath27 ( up to an arbitrary constant ) as the age of our universe , where @xmath28 is the scale factor of a friedmann - robertson - walker universe and @xmath29 is the hubble parameter ( the dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath30 ) .",

    "regardless of the choice of @xmath65 , it is not sufficient to concentrate only on the gravitational sector of the theory when studying the concurrent cosmology . in order to study the transition between deceleration and acceleration",

    "<S> recently a new model of dynamical dark energy , or time - varying @xmath0 , was proposed by cai [ arxiv:0707.4049 ] by relating the energy density of quantum fluctuations in a minkowski space - time , namely @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and t is the cosmic time , to the present day dark energy density . in this note , we show that the model can be adjusted to the present values of dark energy density parameter @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the equation of state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) only if the numerical coefficient @xmath7 takes a reasonably large value ( @xmath8 ) or the present value of the gravitational coupling of q - field to ( dark ) matter is also nonzero , namely , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the present value of dark energy density fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some of the difficulties of this proposal as a viable dark energy model with a constant @xmath7 ; especially , the bound imposed on the dark energy density parameter @xmath11 during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) requires @xmath12 . to overcome this drawback </S>",
    "<S> , we outline a few modifications where such constraints can be weakened or relaxed . finally , by establishing a correspondence between the agegraphic dark energy scenario and the standard scalar - field model , we also point out some interesting features of an agegraphic quintessence model .    </S>",
