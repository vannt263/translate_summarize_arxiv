    "central heavy ion collisions at relativistic incident energies represent an ideal tool to study nuclear matter at high temperatures .",
    "particle production is  at all incident energies  a key quantity to extract information on the properties of nuclear matter under these extreme conditions .",
    "particles carrying strangeness have turned out to be very valuable messengers .",
    "a specific purpose of this paper is the presentation of the evolution of strange particle production over a large range of incident energies .",
    "the data at low incident energies , i.e.  at and below the production threshold in @xmath7 collisions will be shown in more detail as these results are less presented in other works .",
    "many results are shown together with a theoretical interpretation .",
    "the attempts to describe particle production yields with statistical models  @xcite have turned out to be very successful over this large domain of incident energies .",
    "at incident energies around 1 @xmath4gev pion and kaon production is very different : pions can be produced by direct @xmath7 collisions but kaons not .",
    "the threshold for @xmath0 production in @xmath7 collisions is 1.58 @xmath4gev and only collective effects can accumulate the energy needed to produce a @xmath0 together with a @xmath8 ( or another strange particle ) for strangeness conservation .",
    "the measured multiplicities for pions and @xmath0 differ evidently by orders of magnitude .",
    "they exhibit a further very pronounced contrast : while the pion multiplicity per number of participating nucleons @xmath9 remains constant with @xmath9 , the @xmath0 multiplicity per @xmath9 rises strongly ( fig .  [ apart ] ) .",
    "the latter observation seems to be in conflict with a thermal interpretation , which  in a naive view  should give multiplicities per mass number @xmath10 being constant .",
    "usually , the particle number densities or the multiplicities per @xmath9 , here for pions , are described in a simplified way by a boltzmann factor @xmath11with the temperature @xmath5 and the total energy @xmath12 .",
    "the production of strange particles has to fulfil strangeness conservation .",
    "the attempt to describe the measured particle ratios including strange hadrons at ags and sps using a strangeness chemical potential @xmath13 is quite successful  @xcite . however , this grand - canonical treatement is not sufficient , if the number of produced strange particles is small .",
    "then , a statistical model has to take care of _ exact strangeness conservation _ in each reaction as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this is done by taking into account that e.g.  together with each @xmath0 a @xmath8 or another strange particle is produced : @xmath14,\\]]where @xmath5 is the temperature , @xmath6 the baryo - chemical potential , @xmath15 the degeneracy factors , @xmath16 the production volume for making the associate pair ( see  @xcite ) and @xmath17 the total energies .",
    "we note that this volume is not identical to the volume of the system at freeze out .",
    "the volume parameter @xmath16 is taken as @xmath18 with a common @xmath19 for all systems and all incident energies .",
    "this formula , simplified for demonstration purposes , neglects other combinations leading to the production of @xmath0 as well as the use of bose - fermi distributions , which are all included in the computation . the corresponding formula for @xmath1 production @xmath20.\\]]is similar , but does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "this point will become important later on .",
    "these formulae lead to a reduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields as compared to the numbers calculated without exact strangeness conservation  @xcite .",
    "two extreme conditions can be seen from these equations . in the limit of a small number of strange particles , the additional term ( due to the parameter @xmath16 ) leads to a linear rise of @xmath21 while @xmath22 remains constant .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement with the experimental observations shown in fig .",
    "[ apart ] .",
    "for very high temperatures or very large volumina , the terms in brackets approach unity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the formulae coincide with the grand - canonical procedure .",
    "this is much better seen in the exact formulae using modified bessel functions  @xcite .    at low incident energies , the particle ratios ( except @xmath23 )",
    "are well described using the canonical approach  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , even the measured @xmath24 ratio is described and this ratio does not depend on the choice of the volume term @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted that the statistical model uses normal masses of the particles while many transport calculation @xcite have to reduce the @xmath1 mass ( as expected for kaon in the nuclear medium ) in order to describe the measured yields .",
    "it is therefore of interest to see how the results of the statistical model appear in a representation where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities are given as a function of @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ kp_km_sthr_therm ] .",
    "the choice of the x - axis follows the idea to correct for the different energy thresholds to produce @xmath0 in @xmath7 collisions ( @xmath25 = 2.548 gev ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath25 = 2.87 gev ) .",
    "it turned out that in this representation the measured yields of @xmath0 and @xmath1 close to threshold in heavy ion collisions are about equal while they differ in pp collisions by factors of 10  100 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ kp_km_sthr_therm ] demonstrates that at values of @xmath2 less than zero , the excitation functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross leading to the observed equality of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at sis energies .",
    "the yields differ at ags energies by a factor of five .",
    "the difference in the rise of the two excitation functions can be understood by the formulae given above .",
    "the one for @xmath0 production contains ( @xmath26 ) while the other has @xmath27 in the exponent of the second term .",
    "as these two values are different , the excitation functions , i.e.  the variation with @xmath5 , exhibit a different rise .",
    "furthermore , the two formulae predict that the @xmath24 ratio for a given collision should not vary with centrality as @xmath16 cancels in the ratio .",
    "indeed , this has been observed in au+au / pb+pb collisions between 1.5 @xmath4gev and rhic energies  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ kpkm_sis_rhic ] .",
    "this independence of centrality is most astonishing as one expects at low incident energies an influence of the different thresholds and the density variation with centrality . at",
    "1.93 @xmath4gev the @xmath0 production is above and the @xmath1 production below their respective @xmath7 thresholds .",
    "transport - model calculations show clearly that strangeness equilibration requires a time interval of 40  80 fm/@xmath28  @xcite . on the other hand , the statistical models assuming chemical equilibration are quite successful in describing the particle yields , including strange particles .    in case of the @xmath0 production",
    ", no strong absorptive channel seems to be available which could lead to chemical equlibration . for @xmath1 production",
    "the situation is quite different . at low incident energies",
    "strange quarks are found only in a few hadrons .",
    "the @xmath29 quark is essentially only in @xmath0 , while the @xmath30 quark will be shared between @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( or other hyperons ) .",
    "this sharing of the @xmath30 quark might be in chemical equlibrium as the reactions @xmath31 are strong and have only slightly negative q - values of -176 mev .",
    "the idea that the @xmath1 yield is dominated by strangeness exchange via the @xmath32 channel has been suggested by  @xcite and has been demonstrated quantitavely in a recent theoretical study  @xcite .",
    "the direct @xmath33 pair production via baryon - baryon collisions has negligible influence as these @xmath1 are absorbed entirely . in these transport - model calculations",
    "the strangeness exchange is approaching equilibrium but does not fully reach it  @xcite .",
    "if these reactions are the dominating channel , the law of mass action might be applied giving for the respective concentrations  @xcite @xmath34 \\cdot [ \\lambda]}{[k^- ] \\cdot n } \\",

    "[ kpkm_sis_rhic ] ) as the pion multiplicity does not vary with centrality .",
    "figure  [ massaction ] demonstrates the constancy of the @xmath38 ratio and of the pion multiplicity with @xmath9 for ni+ni and au+au collisions at 1.5 @xmath4gev  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these ratios do not even depend on the choice of the collision system .",
    "the right part of this figure exhibits the double ratio @xmath39/[k^+])/([m(\\pi^0 + \\pi^-)]/a_{part})$ ] which shows only a minor deviation from a horizontal line .",
    "this result can be taken as an argument that this specific channel might be not far from chemical equilibrium .",
    "next we test in fig .",
    "[ massaction_sis_rhic ] the validity of the law of mass action by plotting the @xmath38 ratio as a function of the pion multiplicity @xmath40 at incident energies from sis up to rhic . at sis and ags energies",
    "the direct relation holds , i.e.  the @xmath38 ratio rises with @xmath40 . at sps and rhic energies @xmath1 are obviously produced by other channels , i.e.  @xmath33 pair production .",
    "this change of the dominating channel is well reproduced by the statistical model ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ massaction_sis_rhic ] ) .",
    "the experimental data from heavy ion collisions show that the @xmath3 ratio rises from sis up to ags but it is larger for ags than at the highest cern - sps energies @xcite and even at rhic @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ kp_pi_ratio ] .",
    "this behavior is of particular interest as it could signal the appearance of new dynamics for strangeness production in high energy collisions .",
    "it was even conjectured  @xcite that this property could indicate an energy threshold for quark - gluon plasma formation in relativistic heavy ion collisions .    in the following",
    "we analyze the energy dependence of strange to non - strange particle ratios in the framework of a hadronic statistical model . in the whole energy range ,",
    "the hadronic yields observed in heavy ion collisions resemble those of a population in chemical equilibrium along a unified freeze - out curve determined by the condition of fixed energy / particle @xmath42 1 gev @xcite providing a relation between the temperature @xmath5 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath6 . as the beam energy increases @xmath5 rises and @xmath6",
    "is slightly reduced . above ags energies",
    ", @xmath5 exhibits only a moderate change and converges to its maximal value in the range of 160 to 180 mev , while @xmath6 is strongly decreasing .",
    "instead of studying the @xmath3 ratio we use the ratios of strange to non - strange particle multiplicities ( wroblewski factor )  @xcite defined as @xmath43 where the quantities in angular brackets refer to the number of newly formed quark - antiquark pairs , i.e.  it excludes all quarks that were present in the target and the projectile .    applying the statistical model to particle production in heavy ion collisions",
    "calls for the use of the canonical ensemble to treat the number of strange particles particularly for data in the energy range from sis up to ags @xcite as mentioned before .",
    "the calculations for au - au and pb - pb collisions are performed using a canonical correlation volume defined above and given by a radius of @xmath44 fm determined in @xcite .",
    "the quark content used in the wroblewski factor is determined at the moment of _ chemical freeze - out _ ,",
    "i.e.  from the hadrons and especially , hadronic resonances , before they decay .",
    "this ratio is thus not an easily measurable observable unless one can reconstruct all resonances from the final - state particles .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ wrob_composition ] as a function of @xmath45 .    the solid line ( marked `` sum '' ) in fig .",
    "[ wrob_composition ] describes the statistical - model calculations in complete equilibrium along the unified freeze - out curve  @xcite and with the energy - dependent parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from fig .",
    "[ wrob_composition ] we conclude that around 30 @xmath4gev laboratory energy the relative strangeness content in heavy ion collisions reaches a clear and well pronounced maximum .",
    "the wroblewski factor decreases towards higher incident energies and reaches a limiting value of about 0.43 .",
    "for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the appearance of the maximum can be traced to the specific dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath5 on the beam energy .",
    "figure  [ wrob_t_mub ] shows values of constant @xmath46 in the @xmath47 plane . as expected @xmath46 rises with increasing @xmath5 for fixed @xmath6 . following the chemical freeze - out curve , shown as a full dashed line in fig .",
    "[ wrob_t_mub ] , one can see that @xmath46 rises quickly from sis to ags energies , then reaches a maximum around @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev .",
    "these freeze - out parameters correspond to 30 gev laboratory energy . at higher incident energies",
    "the increase in @xmath5 becomes negligible but @xmath6 keeps on decreasing and as a consequence @xmath46 also decreases .",
    "the importance of finite baryon density on the behavior of @xmath46 is demonstrated in fig .  [ wrob_composition ] showing separately the contributions to @xmath50 coming from strange baryons , from strange mesons and from hidden strangeness , i.e.  from hadrons like @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ wrob_composition ] , the origin of the maximum in the wroblewski ratio can be traced to the contribution of strange baryons .",
    "this channel dominates at low @xmath45 and loses importance at high incident energies .",
    "even strange mesons exhibit a broad maximum .",
    "this is due to the presence of associated production of e.g.  kaons together with hyperons .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath3 ratio measured at midrapidity is shown in fig .",
    "[ kp_pi_ratio ] .",
    "the model gives an excellent description of the data , showing a broad maximum at the same energy as the one seen in the wroblewski factor .",
    "in general , of course , statistical - model calculations should be compared with 4@xmath53-integrated results since strangeness does not have to be conserved in a limited portion of phase space .",
    "a drop in this ratio for 4@xmath53 yields has been reported from preliminary results of the na49 collaboration at 158 agev  @xcite .",
    "this decrease is , however , not reproduced by the statistical model without further modifications , e.g.  by introducing an additional parameter @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this point might be clearer when data at other beam energies will become available .",
    "strange particle production in heavy ion collisions close to threshold can be described by a statistical model in canonical formulation , i.e.  using local strangeness conservation .",
    "this approach is able to explain several features of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at sis energies .    while for @xmath0 production it remains open whether and how chemical equlibrium can be reached , the situation for @xmath1 is quite different .",
    "it is shown that the strangeness exchange process @xmath55 is the dominant channel for @xmath1 production at sis and likely also at ags energies .",
    "this is demonstrated by applying the corresponding law of mass action .",
    "theoretical studies confirm this interpretation .    using the energy dependence of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 we have shown that the statistical - model description of relativistic heavy ion collisions predicts that the yields of strange to nonstrange particles reaches a well defined maximum near 30 gev lab energy .",
    "it is demonstrated that this maximum is due to the specific shape of the freeze - out curve in the @xmath47 plane . in particular , a very steep decrease of the baryon chemical potential with increasing energy",
    "causes a corresponding decline of relative strangeness content in systems created in heavy ion collisions above lab energies of 30 gev .",
    "the saturation in @xmath5 , necessary for this result , might be connected to the fact that hadronic temperatures can not exceed the critical temperature @xmath56 170 mev for the phase transition to the qgp as found in solutions of qcd on the lattice .",
