    "recently , we reported energy levels and radiative rates ( @xmath0-values ) for transitions in cr - like co  iv and ni  v @xcite , and here we provide similar results for two other ions , namely cu  vi and zn  vii . generally , ions with @xmath1 are important for the study of astrophysical plasmas .",
    "however , they may also be relevant to research in fusion plasmas , because often some of them are constituent of the reactor walls as impurities .",
    "there are several observed lines of both cu and zn ions ( see for example the chianti database @xcite at @xmath2 ) , but we are not aware specifically of those for cu  vi and zn  vii . however , many of their lines in the 157243   wavelength range are listed in the _ atomic line list ( v2.04 ) _ of peter van hoof ( @xmath3 ) , because these are useful in the generation of synthetic spectra . inspecting the atomic and molecular database stout @xcite , one can see that there are only incomplete sets of level energies for both cu  vi and zn  vii , whereas radiative transition data are completely absent .",
    "additionally , ions of cu have been identified of particular interest to fusion studies @xcite , and hence their atomic data are required for the modelling of such plasmas .",
    "poppe et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to measure energies for levels of the 3d@xmath4 @xmath5d and 3d@xmath5(@xmath4s)4p @xmath5p@xmath6 configurations of cu  vi from a laboratory spectrograph .",
    "soon after , van kleef et al .",
    "@xcite extended their work to measure additional lines of the 3d@xmath5(@xmath7p)4p @xmath5p@xmath6 and 3d@xmath5(@xmath7d)4p @xmath5d@xmath6 multiplets , classifying 29 levels in total .",
    "based on these identifications , van het hof et al .",
    "@xcite calculated energies for the levels of the 3d@xmath4 @xmath5d term",
    ". they used _",
    "least square fitting _ of slater - condon parameters , and their calculations were biased towards the known ( observed or measured ) results and iso - ionic , iso - electronic and iso - nuclear trends . as a result",
    ", their theoretical energies differed between @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the measurements .",
    "however , they also predicted an energy for one additional level , i.e. 3d@xmath5(@xmath7s)4p @xmath10p@xmath11 .",
    "the work of @xcite was further extended by uylings and raassen @xcite who predicted energies for an additional 6 levels of the 3d@xmath54p configuration",
    ". however , the most extensive experimental and theoretical work has been performed by raaasen and van kleef @xcite who identified most of the levels of the 3d@xmath4 , 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p configurations of cu  vi .",
    "their listed ( and other ) energies have been compiled and assessed by sugar and musgrove @xcite , and their recommended values are also available on the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) website @xcite . however , there are a few gaps in the energy spectrum ( including the @xmath12s@xmath13 level of the ground configuration 3d@xmath4 )  see section  [ ene ] and table  [ ene - cu6 ]",
    ". furthermore , no @xmath0-values are available in the literature for transitions of cu  vi , and therefore the aim of the present paper is to complete the spectrum by predicting energies for the missing levels , as well as to calculate the @xmath0-values .    to date the most complete experimental investigation for the energy levels of zn  vii has been performed by van het hof et al .",
    "@xcite , whose results have been compiled , assessed and recommended by sugar and musgrove  @xcite , and are also available at the nist website @xcite .",
    "however , many levels ( in fact more than for cu  vi ) are missing from this compilation ( see section  [ ene ] and table  [ ene - zn7 ] ) , and therefore we have performed our calculations to predict energies for the missing levels as well as to report the @xmath0-values , which are not available in the literature .",
    "in this work , as in our other recent studies , we have employed the quasi - relativistic approximation ( qr ) , described in detail elsewhere @xcite , to determine level energies , radiative lifetimes ( @xmath14 ) and various transition parameters among the levels of the ground configuration 3d@xmath4 and two lowest excited configurations 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p in cu  vi and zn  vii .",
    "the calculations performed here are similar to those for co  iv and ni  v @xcite , and as for those ions , we have also made test calculations with the general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ( grasp ) and the flexible atomic code ( fac ) .",
    "however , energies obtained with both these codes show just as large discrepancies with measurements , in magnitude and orderings , as shown in table  a of @xcite for co  iv . therefore",
    ", we discuss our theoretical results generated only in the qr approximation .",
    "the one - electron radial orbitals ( ro ) for the electrons of the investigated configurations 3d@xmath4 , 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p , and for the 4d and 4f electrons , were determined from the quasi - relativistic hartree - fock equations described in @xcite . in the qr calculations",
    ", relativistic effects are included through the breit - pauli approximation adopted for the quasirelativistic approximation @xcite . to include the correlation , all one- and two - electron promotions from the @xmath15 and @xmath16 electron shells of the investigated configurations are considered in a large ci wavefunction expansion . for electrons with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which describe virtual excitations , the transformed radial orbitals ( tro )",
    "are employed @xcite .",
    "the admixed configurations generated in this way produce over @xmath19 configuration state functions ( csfs ) , which makes the further calculations of @xmath0-values intractable .",
    "therefore , we select only those admixed configurations that have the largest contributions to the ci wavefunction ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . following these procedures ,",
    "the resultant ci basis consists of 425 even and 256 odd configurations of cu  vi , producing 669075 and 991598 csfs , respectively . in the case of zn  vii ,",
    "we include 398 even and 241 odd configurations generating 648845 and 960686 csfs , respectively .",
    "as one can see from these numbers , the admixed configurations produce a very large set of csfs even after the reduction procedures , described in @xcite . because of this",
    ", we must limit the number of the admixed configurations by increasing the selection criterion to @xmath20 , and consequently some important configurations are omitted .",
    "therefore , we can not produce a satisfactory agreement of our results with the available measured energy levels for cu  vi and zn  vii . to improve the accuracy of the calculated data , all slater integrals describing the @xmath21-dependent interactions",
    "are ( slightly ) reduced by @xmath22 for cu  vi and by @xmath23 for zn  vii .",
    "the energies obtained in the qr approximation are listed in table  [ ene - cu6 ] for all 322 levels of the 3d@xmath4 , 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p configurations of cu  vi , along with the nist values . among the lowest 34 levels of the 3d@xmath4 ground configuration ,",
    "the maximum discrepancy between theoretical and experimental energies ( for any level ) is much less than 1% , except for the levels of the lowest term @xmath5d where it is above @xmath24 and reaches a maximum of @xmath25 for the level 2 ( @xmath5d@xmath26 )  but even in this case the absolute energy deviation is just 19@xmath27 .",
    "this is caused by insufficient accuracy in the calculation of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the accuracy achieved here is better than that achieved for co  iv and ni  v @xcite , because of the improvements made in our calculations .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental energies are much lesser  usually less than @xmath28 and not worse than @xmath29  for the remaining levels belonging to the excited configurations 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p .",
    "we note that energies for many levels are missing from the nist compilation ( or the literature ) and therefore , we have predicted energies for such levels  see e.g. , 6289 in table  [ ene - cu6 ] .",
    "since the maximum discrepancy with the measurements among the levels of the excited configurations is less than 0.3% , it should be a robust measure of accuracy for our predicted energies .",
    "finally , the energy orderings between theory and measurement are nearly the same , although there are a few minor differences for close - lying levels , such as 2829 and 3842 .",
    "however , the @xmath30 designations listed in the table are not always definitive , because we have performed just a formal identification based on the maximum percentage contribution of csf in the ci wavefunction expansion , and some levels are highly affected by csfs mixing .",
    "for this reason their description using just a @xmath30 notation is not definitive in all cases , and other level identification scheme have to be applied instead of an @xmath21 designation .",
    "all such levels are shown by a superscript  a \" or  b \"  see e.g. , levels 214 , 220 and 269 .",
    "however , we stress that this problem is not unique to our code or our qr approximation .",
    "it is a general atomic structure issue and applies to all such large calculations , by any code .",
    "this is why a large number of the 3d@xmath54p levels have no identified @xmath21 terms in the nist database @xcite .    in table",
    "[ comp ] we compare our calculated energies with the theoretical work of raaasen and van kleef  @xcite and uylings and raassen  @xcite for common levels , but only for those for which experimental results are not available  see their tables iii and iv . for all these levels",
    "there are no appreciable discrepancies among the three independent calculations .",
    "our calculated energies for the levels of zn  vii are listed in table  [ ene - zn7 ] along with those of the nist compilation , which are available for about 50% of the levels but cover almost the entire energy range . as for the cu",
    "vi results in table  [ ene - cu6 ] , the discrepancies with our calculations are smaller than @xmath24 for the lowest 34 levels of the 3d@xmath4 ground configuration , except for levels 25 , for the same reason as for the ground configuration levels of cu  vi .",
    "however , the agreement with measurement is significantly better  usually better than @xmath31 and no worse than @xmath32 ( in only a few cases ) for the levels of the excited 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p configurations .",
    "this should be indicative of the accuracy of our predicted levels , missing from the nist compilation .",
    "since data for the 3d@xmath54s level energies in the nist compilation are missing , we assume our calculated results can serve as benchmarks for these levels .",
    "to our knowledge , @xmath0-values are not available in the literature for radiative transitions in cu  vi and zn  vii .",
    "therefore , in table  [ tran - cu6 ] we list transition energies ( @xmath33 , @xmath27 ) , wavelengths ( @xmath34 ,  ) , emission radiative rates ( @xmath0-values , s@xmath35 ) , weighted oscillator strengths ( @xmath36 , dimensionless ) , and transition line strengths ( @xmath37-values in atomic units ) for the e1 ( electric dipole ) , e2 ( electric quadrupole ) , and m1 ( magnetic dipole ) transitions of cu  vi among all 322 levels summarised in table  [ ene - cu6 ] belonging to the lowest 3 configurations 3d@xmath4 , 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p .",
    "similar results for zn  vii are presented in table  [ tran - zn7 ] . only those @xmath0-values are listed in tables  [ tran - cu6 ] and [ tran - zn7 ] which are @xmath38 of the largest value for an emission transition probability @xmath0 from the upper level @xmath39 .",
    "this means that very weak transitions are not included to save on space , as their impact on the modelling of plasmas shall be negligible . due to this selection , the @xmath0-values for magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) and electric octupole ( e3 ) transitions are not included in tables  [ tran - cu6 ] and [ tran - zn7 ] , although their data are calculated . however , all the level energies and the radiative transition parameters , such as transition wavelengths , transition probabilities , oscillator strengths and line strengths for the e1 , e2 and m1 transitions determined in the qr approximation , along with electron - impact excitation data determined in the plane - wave born approximation , are freely available in the adamant database at vilnius university ( http://www.adamant.tfai.vu.lt/database ) .",
    "we note that the e3 and m2 transitions are very weak ( i.e. smaller than @xmath24 of the strongest transition ) , and therefore their transition parameters have no entries in this database .",
    "since no other data for @xmath0-values are available in the literature , it is difficult to assess the accuracy of our calculations .",
    "however , since our calculated energies are reliable to better than 1% for a majority of levels , the corresponding data for @xmath0-values are likely to be reasonably accurate . based on conclusions given in @xcite and the assessment of the radiative transition data determined in the qr approximation from our previous work , we are confident that the current @xmath0-values are reliable and can be adopted in plasma spectra modelling .    to allow the application of our data to the modelling of absorption spectra , in tables  [ abs - cu6 ] and [ abs - zn7 ] we list @xmath34 and @xmath40-values for all _ comparatively strong _ absorption e1 transitions ,",
    "i.e. those having @xmath41 .",
    "we note that not all important absorption transitions are present in tables  [ tran - cu6 ] and [ tran - zn7 ] .",
    "these transitions do not normally vary much with differing ci expansion basis .",
    "however , the remaining weak(er ) transitions may show large variations with other independent calculations , as they are more susceptible to changes arising from differing sizes of the ci wavefunction extension and varying the calculation method .",
    "also in tables  [ abs - cu6 ] and [ abs - zn7 ] we present @xmath34 and @xmath40-values for some weaker absorption lines originating from the lowest 5 levels of the ground configuration term 3d@xmath42d",
    ". these lines may be useful for modelling the absorption spectra of low - temperature plasmas , as all the lowest levels of the @xmath5d term are close .",
    "the radiative lifetime @xmath14 of a level @xmath39 is determined as 1.0/@xmath44 , where the sum is over all calculated radiative decay channels with @xmath45 . as for the @xmath0-values ,",
    "no prior theoretical or experimental results are available for @xmath14 for the two ions discussed here .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of our calculated @xmath14 should be no worse than that for the @xmath0-values .",
    "mainly it depends on the strongest emission transitions for a particular level , as the influence of ( numerically more ) weak(er ) transitions in the above sum is less important . for the convenience of future workers , in tables  [ ene - cu6 ] and [ ene - zn7 ] we summarise our values of @xmath14 for all levels .",
    "also listed in the tables are the land @xmath43-factors , which show how the energy levels split in a magnetic field .",
    "these are dimensionless coefficients describing the zeeman effect for a particular @xmath30 level . in the case of a multi - term , multi - configuration wavefunction ,",
    "the land @xmath43-factor is expressed as : @xmath46 here @xmath43 is the land @xmath43-factor , the sum is over all csfs for that level , @xmath47 represents the configuration , @xmath30 are total moments of the level , and @xmath48 is the percentage contribution of a particular csf for the level eigenfunction . comparing the theoretical values of @xmath43 with experiment , one can assess the quality of a multi - reference wavefunction .",
    "energy levels and radiative rates for transitions in cu  vi and zn  vii have been determined in the qr approximation . for the calculations ,",
    "a very large ci wavefunction expansion basis has been adopted which helped to reduce the discrepancies between theory and measurement for energy levels . for the cu  vi ion , based on comparisons with measured ( and limited theoretical ) results , our energy levels of the excited configurations",
    "are assessed to be accurate to better than @xmath28 for most levels . in the case of the ground configuration levels ,",
    "the accuracy usually is no worse than @xmath49 , only with data for the lowest 5 levels ( term @xmath5d ) being somewhat less reliable , but their absolute energy discrepancies do not exceed a few tens of @xmath27 . for the zn  vii ion ,",
    "these differences are even smaller , and do not exceed @xmath50 for the excited configuration levels .",
    "the accuracy of the ground configuration level energies is approximately the same as for cu  vi .",
    "our calculated energies are listed for all 322 levels originating from the 3d@xmath4 , 3d@xmath54s and 3d@xmath54p configurations , cover a much larger range than other available theoretical or experimental results , and is a complete set of energy levels for these three configurations .",
    "this is important as there are no available data for the 3d@xmath54s configuration of zn  vii , whereas only a few level energies have been determined for cu  vi to date .",
    "corresponding data for radiative transition rates have also been calculated and listed for the e1 , e2 and m1 emission transitions among these 322 levels . however , due to the paucity of prior results no comparisons ( and hence accuracy assessments ) can be made .",
    "nevertheless , the accuracy achieved in the determination of energy levels , as well as the good agreement of @xmath0-values for similar multi - electron systems demonstrated in our previous publications , indicate our @xmath0-values should be reliable , particularly for comparatively strong transitions .",
    "a significantly extended data set for the cu  vi and zn  vii energy levels , including not only their identification but also the wavefunction percentage composition , are freely available from our database adamant . in this",
    "we present much more extensive results on the radiative transition parameters , including weaker transitions with a selection criterium decreased by a factor of 10 .",
    "electron - impact excitation cross sections and rates are also tabulated in adamant .",
    "we believe our present data will be useful for the modelling of plasmas as well as for further accuracy assessments .",
