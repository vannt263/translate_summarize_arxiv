    "the gauge - fixing approach to lattice chiral gauge theories  @xcite is presented in our first contribution to these proceedings  @xcite , henceforth denoted by @xmath0 . here",
    "we discuss several issues in more detail .",
    "consider a continuum chiral gauge theory with a gauge group @xmath1 and a renormalizable gauge - fixing action , cf.eq .",
    "( we use ( i.n ) to denoted eq .",
    "( n ) in @xmath0 . )",
    "now take the limit @xmath2 , keeping the product @xmath3 fixed .",
    "this _ reduction _ leads to a free higher - derivative action for the the gauge degrees of freedom ( ) which are still propagating because @xmath4 is finite .",
    "( there are no faddeev - popov ghosts in the u(1 ) case . ) in addition , one obtains a set of free fermions in complex representations of u(1)@xmath5 , which are decoupled from the .",
    "this reduction is interesting for two purposes .",
    "first , it provides us with a well - defined procedure for assigning the fermions to representations of the gauge group .",
    "we can then inspect whether the fermion spectrum is vector - like or chiral .",
    "it also tells us what the continuum limit ( cl ) should be , if a similar reduction is applied to the lattice theory .    on the lattice , setting @xmath6 with fixed @xmath4 means that the link variables are constrained to @xmath7 in the action , and the integration measure @xmath8 is replaced by @xmath9 .",
    "this defines the _ reduced _ model , which on the lattice is an interacting theory involving the compact scalar field @xmath10 .",
    "we note that also the lattice momentum takes values on a compact space ( unlike its continuum counterpart ) .",
    "the lattice kinematics has the all - important dynamical consequence , that the  represented by the @xmath11 field _ couple _ to fermions even if we are careful to choose an anomaly - free spectrum .",
    "this coupling has led to the failure of many chiral fermion proposals ( for a review see  @xcite ) , which can be explained  @xcite by the applicability of the nielsen - ninomiya theorem  @xcite to a wide class of models .",
    "here we consider the reduced model of a u(1 ) lattice gauge theory with a lorentz gauge - fixing action and a mass counterterm .",
    "for the gauge theory , the bosonic and fermionic lattice actions are respectively eqs .",
    "( i.8 ) and  ( i.1 ) .",
    "the reduced model s action is eq .",
    "( i.11 ) , where @xmath12 .",
    "our main result is that the expected fermion spectrum is obtained in the cl of the reduced model .",
    "it consists of charged left - handed ( lh ) and neutral right - handed ( rh ) fermions , which are free and decoupled from the _ gdofs_. this reproduces correctly the @xmath2 limit of the target gauge - fixed continuum theory .",
    "if we now take @xmath13 , only the charged lh fermions will couple to the gauge field , and so we may expect that a u(1 ) chiral gauge theory will emerge in the scaling region of the full lattice gauge theory , provided the fermion spectrum is anomaly - free .",
    "we first consider the free wilson case ( dotted lines ) . here",
    "@xmath14^{-1}$ ] coincides with the lattice hamiltonian . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the two spin - up eigenvalues are @xmath16 in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "these describe a positive - helicity ( rh ) and a negative - helicity ( lh ) fermion , which together constitute a dirac fermion .",
    "we now turn to our model .",
    "the small figure shows that the two eigenvalues form a continuous curve that doubly covers the periodic brillouin zone . as in the free wilson case , this is a consequence of locality .",
    "@xmath18 has a positive - slope and a negative - slope zero .",
    "technically , this is in agreement with the nn theorem .",
    "nevertheless , our model evades the negative physical conclusion of the theorem . for @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath20 is linear .",
    "we can absorb the @xmath21 renormalization constant via @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 we obtain the relativistic relation @xmath25 in the limit @xmath19 , which corresponds to a ( charged ) negative - helicity fermion .",
    "the positive - slope eigenvalue @xmath26 in fig .",
    "5 is _ not _ linear : @xmath27 increases for small @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath26  is consistent with @xmath29 ( and a divergent slope @xmath30 for @xmath19 ) in the infinite volume limit for @xmath31 .",
    "this result is derived from the factorization formula eq .",
    "( [ fctr ] ) where @xmath32 . as discussed before ,",
    "it is consistent with the existence of a _",
    "neutral _ positive - helicity fermion .",
    "( the deviations from linearity of the data points are statistically significant .",
    "their smallness is explained by the smallness of the critical exponent @xmath33 . )",
    "if , instead of setting @xmath34 , we take the cl and analytically continue @xmath35 , we find in the lh charged channel a pole @xmath36 . in this limit @xmath37",
    "coincides with the lh weyl hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "this is not the case in the rh channel because of the @xmath39 factor .",
    "therefore @xmath40 is not a single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "this is a consequence of the infrared singularity @xmath41 of the goldstone field propagator for @xmath31 , for which no particle interpretation is known .",
    "fortunately , the physical fermions decouple from the unphysical sector .",
    "thus , for the first time , we obtain free chiral fermions in the cl of a four - dimensional lattice model ."
