    "large - scale explosive events which involve local violations of the null energy condition ( nec ) lead to the formation of `` islands '' of matter , one of which is our observed universe . the cause of these explosive events is attributed to quantum fluctuations in some field . while a complete calculation of density perturbations in this scenario ( which would require a proper treatment of the back reaction in quantum gravity ) is not attempted ,",
    "the authors show that any other free scalar field responding to the metric fluctuation would produce a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "in this paper we consider a special version of island cosmology where we model the behavior of matter during the nec - violating event as a classical phantom field in order to compute the perturbation spectrum .",

    "such a fluctuation necessarily violates the null energy condition within this volume . in this treatment",
    "we make the working hypothesis that during this phase the energy content within a ( current ) hubble sized volume of the universe behaves like phantom energy , i.e. , a classical perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for pressure and density respectively , and @xmath4 .",
    "the hubble length decreases sharply during this period , though the universe keeps expanding .",
    "the frw phase : _ after the explosive event , the hubble constant is large , and classical radiation fills the volume .",
    "rapid interactions thermalize this radiation , and this part of the universe then follows a radiation - dominated frw evolution leading to the universe that is observed today .",
    "the dilution phase : _ eventually cosmic expansion dilutes out this aggregation of matter , and the volume of space is restored to its initial de sitter state .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will show that this model predicts a ( nearly ) scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations with amplitude sufficient to seed structure , as well as a scale invariant spectrum of tensor perturbations of considerably smaller amplitude .",
    "a similar situation was studied by y.s .",
    "piao in ref .",
    "@xcite using a different calculational approach .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section [ the model ] describes the model in greater detail .",
    "section [ calculational strategy ] discusses the assumptions and outlines our calculational strategy .",
    "section [ the perturbation spectrum ] presents a detailed calculation of both the scalar and tensor power spectra , and section [ conclusions ] summarizes our findings .",
    "in the following subsections , we describe in more detail the three stages of the model , stating the assumptions involved in each stage .",
    "we set our notation as follows : let us choose our cosmic time coordinate @xmath5 such that the phantom phase ( described in section [ the phantom phase ] ) begins at @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we find it more convenient to work in conformal time ( @xmath7 ) where @xmath8 and @xmath7 ranges between @xmath9 as @xmath5 goes from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "we set our conformal time coordinates such that the period of phantom cosmology lasts between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the above choices of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are arbitrary and for convenience .",
    "primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time , and dots denote derivatives with respect to cosmic time .",
    "we adopt the convention that the suffix @xmath16 denotes the value of a quantity at @xmath17 and the suffix @xmath18 denotes the value at @xmath13 .",
    "this phase represents the initial state of the universe , before the onset of the phantom behavior . in this phase , we assume that the universe is de sitter space inflating due to the observed dark energy , which we assume is a cosmological constant .",
    "the hubble parameter ( @xmath19 ) has the same value that it has today , which we call @xmath20 .",
    "this expanding de sitter background can be part of a classical de sitter spacetime with no beginning and no end , with early contraction and then expansion .",
    "we will only consider the expanding phase of the de sitter spacetime in the following discussion .",
    "we assume that the matter content of the universe is a classical scalar field ( @xmath21 ) having a lagrangian @xmath22 given by :    @xmath23    and a stress tensor given by : @xmath24 @xmath25 represent the components of the metric , and @xmath26 represents the potential .",
    "for the sake of generality , we have inserted the constant @xmath27 which determines the sign of the kinetic term .",
    "obviously , @xmath28 for an ordinary classical scalar field , and @xmath29 for a phantom field .",
    "the equation of motion of the field is the klien gordon equation : @xmath30    the scale factor @xmath31 and hubble value @xmath32 during this period can be written as follows :    for @xmath33 :    @xmath34    in terms of conformal time , for @xmath35 :    @xmath36      in this phase , lasting between the times @xmath15 and @xmath37 , the universe undergoes an nec - violating quantum fluctuation .",
    "we model this phase by assuming that the matter content of the universe behaves like a phantom field @xmath38 for the duration of the fluctuation .",
    "we assume that this hypothetical phantom field @xmath38 is classical , i.e. , its lagrangian and stress tensor are given by eq .   and",
    "eq .  , and it satisfies the klien gordon equation eq .  .",
    "using the above equations , one can readily determine the pressure @xmath2 and energy density @xmath3 of the field .",
    "these work out to : @xmath39    clearly , @xmath40 indicating , as one would expect , that the nec is violated during this period if our matter field is phantom @xmath41 .    also during this phase , the hubble horizon size drops from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that this drop is linear in cosmic time , ending at time @xmath44 .",
    "the validity of this assumption , as well as its implications on the matter content of the universe are discussed later .",
    "thus ,    @xmath45    here @xmath46 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the rate at which the horizon size changes during the phantom phase .",
    "we assume that the quantum fluctuation is very abrupt , and hence @xmath46 is very large .    using the definition of conformal time ,",
    "it is easy to deduce that during this phase ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48^{-\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\\\    \\label{hamba } { \\cal h}(\\eta ) & = & \\frac{a'(\\eta)}{a(\\eta)}=\\frac{h_{\\lambda}}{[-\\alpha - h_{\\lambda}(1+\\alpha ) \\eta ] } \\\\   \\label{h } h(\\eta ) & = & \\frac{{\\cal h}(\\eta)}{a(\\eta)}=h_{\\lambda}\\left[a(\\eta)\\right]^{\\alpha }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we also need to address the nature of the back - reaction of matter on geometry .",
    "let us make the working hypothesis that the back - reaction is fully described by the friedmann equation .",
    "the actual time duration of this phase can be calculated by demanding continuity of the hubble value at @xmath49 ( or equivalently , @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus we require ( see eq .  ) , @xmath50 solving the above equation for @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath51\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath52 and since @xmath53 , the first term in the square brackets can be ignored leaving us @xmath54\\ ] ] from this we can compute the duration of the phantom phase in conformal time ( @xmath55 ) , as follows : @xmath56 again , since @xmath53 , this is a vanishingly small interval .",
    "in this epoch we have a volume of space of hubble length @xmath57 filled with classical radiation .",
    "rapid interactions thermalize the radiation , after which this volume follows a standard frw evolution .",
    "the scale factor in this radiation - dominated epoch can therefore be written as @xmath58 in terms of the conformal time , this reduces to @xmath59",
    "we make two key assumptions to facilitate our calculation , which we discuss below .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "[ phant]during the nec - violating explosive event the energy content of the universe behaves as a phantom field .",
    "2 .   [ slope]during the nec violation , the drop in the hubble scale is linear in cosmic time .",
    "assumption ( [ phant ] ) is an attempt to model the behavior of the matter field during the nec - violating event . to calculate density fluctuations due to fluctuations in the nec - violating field ,",
    "one needs a suitable model for the evolution of the field itself during the nec - violating fluctuation .",
    "this evolution is quantum and not described as a solution to some classical equation of motion . for the purpose of this calculation , we have made the simplifying assumption that the matter field behaves in the same manner as a classical object that would also violate the nec and produce the same effect on the spacetime .",
    "of course this purely classical treatment can not substitute for a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of the nec - violation , but we hope that it captures the essential elements of the physics involved .    assumption ( [ slope ] ) can be justified considering that the drop in the hubble length need not be linear throughout the explosive event , but only during the window of time @xmath60 that it takes for the scales observed today to leave the horizon . since the fluctuation itself is very short lived , the drop in @xmath61 over @xmath60 can be well approximated to be linear .",
    "we now turn our attention to computing the spectrum of perturbations that would be generated in this cosmological model .",
    "our plan of action is the following :    1 .   working in @xmath62 ( momentum or wavenumber ) space ,",
    "we first find expressions for the mukhanov variable @xmath63 in all the three stages of the model .",
    "the mukhanov variable is a gauge - invariant linear combination of matter and metric perturbations representing the true dynamical degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "it is fully described in @xcite .",
    "the unknown coefficients that arise in the above expressions are then determined by demanding continuity of @xmath63 and its time derivative @xmath64 at transition times @xmath15 and @xmath37 .",
    "3 .   the adiabatic density perturbation responsible for structure in the universe is conveniently characterized by the curvature perturbation @xmath65 seen by comoving observers .",
    "once we fully determine @xmath63 in the radiation dominated phase , we obtain the co - moving curvature perturbation spectrum from the relation ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath66 @xmath67 being defined by the relation @xmath68",
    "in the next three subsections ( [ de sitter phase perturbations ] , [ phantom phase perturbations ] and [ frw phase perturbations ] ) , we find expressions for @xmath69 in the three stages of the model .",
    "the unknown coefficients are determined in [ unknown coefficients ] , and the scalar and tensor power spectra are computed in [ scalar power spectrum ] and [ tensor power spectrum ] respectively .      for a scalar field in de sitter space",
    ", the gauge - invariant mukhanov variable @xmath63 can be shown to satisfy the equation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath70 v_{k}(\\eta ) = 0\\ ] ] the solutions to this equation are the bunch - davies mode functions : @xmath71      in this case we will calculate @xmath69 starting from first principles .",
    "the first step is to perturb the matter and metric . working in longitudinal gauge and assuming no anisotropic stress , the scalar metric perturbations are written as : @xmath72 given our choice of gauge , the metric perturbation @xmath73 coincides with the gauge - invariant bardeen potential ( see , for example @xcite ) .",

    "this is a surprising result , since all the equations used to derive eq .",
    "are @xmath27 dependent .",
    "physically , this result implies that the evolution of the metric perturbation is insensitive to whether the matter content of the universe is normal or phantom .    to solve eq .  , we need to determine the dynamics of the phantom field @xmath85 , which is in turn determined by the potential @xmath26 .",

    "a similar scenario was investigated by y.s piao @xcite , and while he obtains a scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations , the tensor perturbation spectrum in his calculation turns out to be blue - shifted .",

    "while an ideal approach would be a full quantum mechanical calculation , it is hoped that our classical calculation can capture the essential elements of the physics involved .",
    "our calculations yield , ( using an exactly solvable potential ) , an adiabatic spectrum of scale - invariant perturbations , whose amplitude is determined by the value of the hubble constant at the end of the nec - violating fluctuation . if we assume the latter to be approximately gut scale , the perturbation spectrum turns out to have an amplitude sufficient to seed the cosmological structure seen today .",
    "we also obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves of amplitude set by @xmath172 .",
    "the essential elements of island cosmology , namely , the @xmath0-sea and the scale invariant perturbation spectra , are supported by current observations .",
