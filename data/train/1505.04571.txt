    "as a forthcoming facility in future , the anti - proton annihilations at darmstadt ( @xmath6anda ) experiment will focus on the production of charmonium , which is govern by nonperturbative effect of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . before @xmath6anda run",
    ", there were pioneering theoretical studies of the charmonium production in the @xmath7 annihilation processes  @xcite . by calculating two hadron - level diagrams introduced by the born approximation ,",
    "gaillard and maiani firstly studied the differential cross section of the charmonium production plus a soft pion in the @xmath8 reaction  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross sections of the chamonium ( @xmath9 ) production accompanied by a light meson ( @xmath10 ) from the process of @xmath11 was calculated by combing with the measured partial decay widths of charmonium decay into @xmath12 .",
    "and then , barnes and li proposed an initial state light meson emission model for the near threshold associated charmonium production processes @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and the total and differential cross sections for these reactions were evaluated  @xcite .",
    "it is also found that the cross section of @xmath15 near threshold may be affected by the pauli @xmath16 coupling  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lin , xu and liu revisited the issue of the production of charmonium plus a light meson at @xmath6anda , where the contribution of form factors ( ffs ) to these processes are included  @xcite .",
    "recently , pire _",
    "_ studied the associated production of a @xmath17 and a pion in antiproton - nucleon annihilation in the framework of qcd collinear factorization  @xcite , while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exclusive charmonium production process @xmath18 was studied within a nucleon - pole exchange model by including off - shell hadronic ffs and a complete lorentz structure with a @xmath19 pauli strong coupling .",
    "the contributions from the intermediate @xmath1 states are also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was found that one can not ignore the contributions of the @xmath1 resonances in the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "the experimental activity on the charmonium decays have run in parallel .",
    "these decays are of interest because they can be used to study the associated charomonium production in @xmath21 annihilation . in 2014 ,",
    "the besiii collaboration reported the analysis of @xmath22 in the vicinity of @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the born cross section of @xmath24 , the corresponding @xmath25 and @xmath26 invariant mass distributions of @xmath27 process are also measured  @xcite . these new experimental information in ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to further perform a comprehensive study of @xmath28 , which stimulates our interest to study the contribution of excited nucleon resonances ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath29 and @xmath30 production from @xmath31 reaction .",
    "the nucleon is the simplest system in which the three colors of qcd can combine to form a colorless object , thus it is important to understand the internal quark - gluon structure of the nucleon and its excited @xmath1 states , and the study of excited @xmath1 states is an interested research field of hadron physics  @xcite , which can make our knowledge of hadron spectrum abundant .",
    "a very important source of information for the nucleon internal structure is the @xmath1 mass spectrum as well as its various production and decay rates , while the charmonium decay into @xmath32 is an ideal platform to study excited @xmath1 nucleon resonances , because it provides an effective isospin 1/2 filter for the @xmath33 system due to isospin conservation  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce excited @xmath1 nucleon resonances in the process of @xmath34 . by fitting the @xmath25 and @xmath35 invariant mass distributions of the cross section of @xmath36",
    ", we extract the information of couplings of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which not only reflects the inner features of discussed @xmath1 , but also helps us to learn the role played by @xmath1 in the @xmath39 .",
    "based on our studying on the @xmath40 process , we move forward to study the @xmath31 reaction , which is due to the cross relation between the @xmath41 decay and the @xmath42 reaction  @xcite . here",
    ", these extracted parameters from our study of @xmath39 will be employed to estimate the production rate of @xmath43 and relevant features .",
    "we calculate the total and differential cross sections of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "it is shown that the contribution of nucleon pole to this reaction is the largest close to the reaction threshold .",
    "however , the interference between nucleon pole and the other nucleon resonance affects significantly and could change the angle distributions clearly .",
    "additionally , there were abundant experimental data of @xmath44 given by besiii  @xcite , where besiii released the branching ratio @xmath45 and the measured @xmath46 and @xmath47 invariant mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "this experimental status related to @xmath48 makes us extend the above study to the @xmath49 decay , and also the @xmath50 reaction .",
    "our studies provide valuable information to future experimental exploration of @xmath30 and @xmath48 productions plus a pion through the @xmath21 interaction at @xmath6anda .",
