    "<S> theory and simulations show that the decrease in @xmath7 occurs on the time scale on the order of utmost @xmath8 20 @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the modest decrease in @xmath7 and the rapid collapse suggest that high spatial and temporal resolution , currently beyond the scope of most small angle x - ray scattering experiments , are needed to detect compaction in finite - sized proteins . </S>",

    "<S> based on the observation that the folding kinetics is mono - phasic , with no detectable burst phase in the initial fluorescence of the initial unfolding time course , it was surmised that there is no low energy intermediate in the unfolding of pdz2 . </S>",

    "<S> ( iii ) the high energy intermediate is non - detectable under stabilizing conditions , achievable in pdz2 domain by addition of modest amount of sodium sulfate . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> pdz2 folds thermodynamically and kinetically in a two - state manner . </S>",

    "<S> * collapse and folding transition : * is the size of the polypeptide chain of the unfolded state under folding conditions ( @xmath0 < c_m$ ] ) less than at @xmath0 > c_m$ ] ? </S>",
    "<S> theoretical arguments @xcite , simulations @xcite , and a number of single molecule fret and saxs experiments @xcite have answered the question in the affirmative whereas some saxs experiments on protein l suggest that there is no evidence for polypeptide chain collapse , which is manifestly unphysical . the arguments in favor of collapse preceding folding is based on the following observations . </S>",
    "<S> the random coil state of a polypeptide chain with @xmath183 residues is expected to be @xmath184 with @xmath185 2.0 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is likely to be an upper bound because even 8 m urea is not a good solvent because even at these elevated concentrations the unfolded state has residual structure . </S>",
    "<S> as the denaturant concentration decreases the maximum decrease in @xmath143 is likely to have a lower bound @xmath186 </S>",
    "<S> . it can not be maximally compact because if it were so then enthalpic interactions would drive these structures to the folded state for which @xmath187 with @xmath188 = 3.0@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we surmise that @xmath189 . the reduction in @xmath143 of the unfolded state for @xmath190 ( protein l ) </S>",
    "<S> is predicted to be between ( 5 - 10)% depending on the values of @xmath191 and @xmath192 . in pdz2 ( @xmath193 ) </S>",
    "<S> we find that the unfolded state @xmath143 decreases by only 9% as @xmath0 $ ] decreases ( figure 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , due to finite @xmath183 resulting in a small decrease in the unfolded state @xmath143 requires high precision saxs measurements to measure changes in @xmath194 as @xmath0 $ ] decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the errors in saxs for protein l are far too large to accurately estimate @xmath194 , especially under native conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the absence of detectable contracted form of the polypeptide chain in time resolved saxs experiments protein l was used as further evidence that compact states are not formed in the folding of any single domain protein . using theory @xcite it can be shown that collapse of the unfolded state occurs on time scales on the order of @xmath195 where @xmath11 is between 1.5 and 2.2 , and @xmath196 . </S>",
    "<S> for pdz2 we estimate that @xmath197 . </S>",

    "<S> . a larger value of @xmath202 , much shorter than the folding time , for reconfiguration time has also been reported for protein l @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the larger dhfr ( @xmath203 ) there is nearly a 23% reduction in @xmath194 in @xmath204 @xcite , which is also considerably shorter than the folding time . </S>",
    "<S> all the studies show that collapse of the unfolded state , which increases with @xmath183 , is on the order of at most tens of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the time resolution in the most recent saxs experiments on protein l ( 4 ms ) @xcite , which is comparable to the folding time , is too long to shed light on compaction of the polypeptide chain . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of 15 his tags in the first study @xcite makes it difficult to ascertain the relevance for protein l. indeed , the inability to accurately determine determine the characteristics of the unfolded state had also lead to erroneous conclusions about equilibrium collapse and kinetic foldability @xcite , which has been corrected recently using smfret experiments recently @xcite .    fast mixing experiments that simultaneously detect compaction and acquisition of structure on a number of proteins </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have produced ample evidence that collapse is an integral process of the folding process , as predicted by theory . </S>",
    "<S> although it is likely that the simplified analysis of smfret measurements overestimates the extent of collapse @xcite , fast mixing saxs experiments on a variety of proteins leave no doubt that the unfolded state is indeed more compact ( albeit by only about @xmath205 9% ) under native conditions despite persistent claims to the contrary based on saxs data based largely on one protein ( protein l ) with large errors . it is a pity that the erroneous conclusion has resulted in unnecessary obfuscation . </S>",
    "<S> what is needed are high precision data for single domain proteins spanning a range of @xmath183 ( say between 50 - 250 ) , which can not be easily obtained by saxs alone @xcite but is more readily available in smfret experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> * detection of @xmath1 in pdz2 in single molecule pulling experiments : * the downward curvature in the unfolding rate as a function @xmath0 $ ] in pdz2 implies that an intermediate is populated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> single molecule pulling experiments are well suited to explore this finding more readily . based on the free energy profile computed here and postulated elsewhere @xcite , we suggest that unfolding by mechanical force ( @xmath206 ) would give rise to downward curvature in a plot of @xmath207 versus @xmath206 . at low forces the inner barrier separating </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath110 and @xmath1 would dominate whereas at high forces the second outer barrier is relevant for mechanical unfolding . </S>",
    "<S> the two sequential barrier picture implies that there would be two transition state distances with a switch between the two occurring as @xmath206 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible support for this argument comes from the observation that the tanford @xmath208 as a function of @xmath0 $ ] exhibits a sigmoidal behavior ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) with @xmath208 changing from 0.35 at low @xmath0 $ ] to 0.85 at high @xmath0 $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to the conclusion in @xcite suggesting that in tse1 @xmath11 strands @xmath164 are structured whereas the other secondary structural elements are essentially disordered . although the agreement between the predicted structures in our work and those reported in @xcite in tse2 is better in that we find that it is native - like , there are crucial differences as well </S>",
