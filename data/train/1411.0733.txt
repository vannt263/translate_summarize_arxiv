    "the hormone auxin plays a central role .",
    "auxin was discovered over a half century ago along with some of its macroscopic effects on leaf and root growth @xcite .",
    "is actively transported the plant s",
    "architecture @xcite .    in the past decade , much has been learned about the molecular actors controlling auxin movement .",
    "first , cell - to - cell auxin fluxes depend on two classes of transporters @xcite : ( i ) pin , , that pumps auxin from inside to outside cells @xcite , and ( ii ) aux1 , , pumps auxin from outside to inside cells .",
    "second , auxin accumulation drives cell proliferation and differentiation .",
    "third , cells are polarized their pin content , that is pin transporters localize mainly to one side of cells @xcite . in addition , these polarizations are similar from cell to cell so that auxin is systematically transported along the direction of this polarization .",
    "that has major consequences for the morphogenesis because it affects the distribution of auxin , and auxin drives the initiation of new organs @xcite .",
    "much work has focused on how pin polarization patterns lead to auxin distributions , but two major questions remain unanswered concerning the emergence of pin polarization patterns : ( i ) can pin become polarized in cells in the absence of auxin gradients ?",
    "( ii ) can pin polarization patterns be coherent on the scale of many cells ?    to address these questions , we take a modeling approach here , incorporating the main ingredients of what is currently known about ( i ) intercellular auxin transport and ( ii ) intracellular pin dynamics .",
    "we will first provide a deterministic framework using differential equations for modeling the dynamics of auxin and of pin cellular polarization .",
    "our model exhibits multiple steady states we characterize , the simplest ones being translation - invariant with all cells having the same .",
    "we find that the emergence of polarization depends on the degree within the pin recycling dynamics .",
    "we then include molecular noise in this system coming from the stochastic dynamics of pin intra - cellular localization .",
    "interestingly , for biologically realistic values of the parameters , the system is driven into a state where cells coherently polarize in the same direction . in effect , the noise selects a robust self - organised state having homogeneous pin polarization , corresponding to a noise - induced ordering scenario .",
    "auxin transport of a single layer of cells . which is referred to as the l1 layer @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore work layer of cells . start with a lattice of cubic cells having edges of @xmath0 separated by apoplasts ",

    "[ fig : schematicmodel ] which represents a view from above of this system ) .",
    "tissues consist of closely packed cells so @xmath2 ; typical values are @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the hormone auxin @xcite is subject to different processes :    * production and degradation inside cells , with rate constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; * passive diffusion within cells , within apoplasts , and also between cells and apoplasts ; * active transport across cell membranes via transporters .",
    "since cell membranes form barriers to exchanges of molecules , taking a molecular species from one side to the other often requires dedicated transporters . in the case of auxin ,",
    "the cell membrane does allow some amount of diffusion of the hormone but much less than the inside of the cell or of the apoplast where diffusion is very rapid .",
    "we call @xmath7 the associated diffusion constant ( measured in @xmath8 ) _ within _ the membrane of thickness @xmath9 whereas formally we consider diffusion inside cells and inside apoplasts to arise infinitely quickly ; as a consequence , intra - cellular variations of auxin concentration are negligible and so are those within an apoplast .",
    "in addition , auxin is subject to active processes that transport it across the cell membrane .",
    "experimental evidence has shown that there are different molecular transporters for the in - going and out - going fluxes , transporters called respectively aux1 and pin @xcite .",
    "these transporters are normally localised on the cell membrane where they can play their role to actively transport auxin between the inside and the outside of the cell .",
    "the out - going transporters belong to a large family whose members specialize to different organs and tissues of the plant @xcite : in our context , we will refer to these transporters simply as pin @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of auxin concentration in each region ( cell or apoplast ) is specified by the trans - membrane along with production and degradation terms . in the case of cells",
    ", we have @xmath10 .",

    ". both concentrations will be specified in micro - moles per liter ( @xmath17 m for micro - molar ) .",
    "furthermore , only the diffusion constant of auxin _ within _ the cell membrane appears because it is far smaller than that within a cell or apoplast ; .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the auxin flux _ densities _ carried by the transporters through the `` face '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , the area of the membrane of cell @xmath15 that faces cell @xmath16 . by convention ,",
    "the sign of each flux is positive , the one for pin going from the inside to the outside of the cell , and the one for aux1 going from outside to inside .",
    "these flux densities have units of micro - moles per second per surface area ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the sum over cells @xmath16 is restricted to the neighbors of @xmath15 so in effect one sums over all sides of the cell @xmath15 under consideration that connect to the rest of the system .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath6 are the rates of auxin production and degradation . in addition , the factor @xmath0 appears because one goes from flux densities to effects on the concentrations inside cells .",
    "lastly , in our framework as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematicmodel ] , apoplasts connect only to cells and vice versa , there are cell - to - cell nor apoplast - to - apoplast contacts .    in a similar fashion , the concentration @xmath14 of auxin in the apoplast separating cells @xmath15 and @xmath16 obeys the differential equation : @xmath22 ~ . \\end{split } \\label{eq : auxindifferentialequation_apoplast}\\ ] ] note that there is neither production nor degradation of auxin in the apoplast ( it is a passive medium and auxin has a long lifetime in the absence of the active degradation processes present in cells ) .    in _ arabidopsis _ , which currently is the most studied plant , aux1 influx transporters seems to be several times higher than that passive diffusion @xcite , thus active processes are probably the main drivers of auxin distribution .",
    "furthermore , the transporters aux1 and pin are believed to be completely unidirectional ; the associated molecular mechanisms are unclear but involve first the binding of auxin and then conformational changes . because these processes are analogous to enzymatic reactions , we model the associated auxin fluxes via irreversible michaelis - menten kinetics : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are kinetic constants analogous to catalysis rates .",
    "the factor @xmath27 on the -hand side of these equations corresponds to the surface of the face of each cell , and connects the flux _",
    "density _ to the ( absolute ) flux . at a molecular level",
    ", @xmath28 ( respectively @xmath29 ) refers to the _ number _ of aux1 ( respectively pin ) transporters on the area of @xmath15 s membrane which faces cell @xmath16 .",
    "finally , @xmath30 and @xmath31 play the role of michaelis - menten constants associated with saturation effects ; these could have been taken to be different in eqs .  [",
    "eq : fluxaux1 ] and [ eq : fluxpin ] without any qualitative consequences for the .",
    "we are not aware of any experimental evidence that the distribution of aux1 transporters changes with time or that these transporters contribute to cell polarity .",
    "thus we shall assume that their numbers are constant on each face of the cell .",
    "in contrast , pin transporters are particularly important for driving morphogenesis through the formation of polarity patterns .",
    "often they define polarized fields in tissues @xcite where cells see their pins predominantly localised to one of their faces , the face being the same for many cells .",
    "that polarity leads to coherent auxin transport , @xcite . to take into account this possibility of pin , we introduce the four faces of a cell as .",
    "( the two faces parallel to the play no role in our simplified . )",
    "then each face of a cell has a potentially variable number of pin transporters :    @xmath32 ,    furthermore we impose the constraint @xmath33 , a cell - independent constant so each cell has the same number of pin transporters at all times .",
    "the dynamics of pin seem complex : it is known that pins are subject to `` recycling '' within a cell through different mechanisms including transport from the membrane to the apparatus and back to the membrane @xcite .",
    "most modeling takes pin dynamics to be driven by surrounding auxin concentrations @xcite .",
    "for instance it has been postulated that pin might accumulate to the membrane facing the neighboring cell with the highest concentration of auxin @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the presence of an auxin gradient becomes a necessary condition for pin polarization .",
    "here we consider instead dynamics based on _ flux sensing _ where pin recycling rates are modulated by the amount of auxin flux transported by those same pin transporters .",
    "mathematically , we take the pin dynamics on a face @xmath34 of a cell to be : @xmath35 differential equations model the competitive recycling of the pins amongst the faces of a given cell in a flux dependent manner .",
    "note that @xmath36 is the characteristic time scale of the recycling process and that the dynamics enforce the constraint of conservation of the total number of pin transporters inside each cell . also , in eq .",
    "[ eq : pinequation ] , @xmath37 is the flux through face @xmath34 while @xmath38 is a constant .    to understand the consequences of eq .",
    "[ eq : pinequation ] , consider first the low flux limit , @xmath37 being small for all faces , so that all denominators can be ignored . at a molecular level",
    ", each transporter leaves the cell membrane at a rate proportional to @xmath39 ; transporters are then brought into the cytoplasm or apparatus ; finally they get reallocated randomly to any of the 4 faces .",
    "in such a low flux regime , cells will show no pin polarization .",
    "second , consider instead the case where for at least one face @xmath34 , @xmath40 is large .",
    "that face will _ benefit _ from the recycling , recruiting more transporters from the other faces than it .",
    "( @xmath41 is just the scale at which flux sensing in this system becomes important ) . at an individual transporter level",
    ", the competitive recycling means that transporters which are actively shuttling auxin see their rate of recycling go down .",
    "how this happens depends on unknown molecular details , nevertheless , the rate of detachment of a transporter from the membrane probably depends on what fraction of the time it is binding auxin and thus the rate of detachment will show a dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "one may attempt to model this via a simple hyperbolic law to describe saturation effects . to be more general ,",
    "we have introduced a hill exponent , @xmath42 , eq .  [ eq : pinequation ] .",
    "such a functional form is often used @xmath42 is an integer related to the number of molecules that must co - localize , co - operative effects . in the absence of detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling pin recycling",
    ", we use this phenomenological form and will see whether or not @xmath42 plays an important role .",
    "the model is now completely specified and involves the 15 parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath25 , @xmath5 , @xmath26 , @xmath6 , @xmath43 , @xmath31 , @xmath41 , @xmath36 , @xmath44 , @xmath28 , @xmath7 , and @xmath42 .",
    "some of these parameters can be absorbed in scale changes .",
    "nevertheless , to keep the physical interpretation as transparent as possible , we stay with the dimensional form of the equations .",
    "whenever possible , we assign values to the parameters using published estimates or compilations thereof  @xcite . for instance , mass - spectrometry measurements @xcite in very young leaves quantify the concentration of auxin to be about 250 picograms per milligram of tissue . since the molecular mass of auxin is about 175",
    ", @xmath45 is of the order of 1 micro - molar . as we shall see , in the steady - state regime , @xmath46 , a relation providing a constraint on those two parameters .",
    "furthermore , a direct estimate of @xmath21 follows from isotopic labeling measurements @xcite which show that biosynthesis replenishes auxin within about one day ; we have thus set @xmath21=1/day .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , for other parameters no experimental data available . for most such cases , we use ball - park estimations that seem reasonable , . however ,",
    "for @xmath42 , which provides a phenomenological parameterization of effects in pin recycling , we have little choice but to study the behavior of the model as a function of its value .",
    "we use the same strategy for @xmath7 .",
    "thus , both @xmath7 and @xmath42 will be used as control parameters , allowing us to map out a two - dimensional phase diagram .",
    "for instance , when increasing @xmath7 , passive diffusion will overcome the effects of active transport , allowing one to probe the importance of active _",
    "vs_.  passive transport in the establishment of pin polarization . unless specified otherwise , all other parameter values are set as provided in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",

    "m stands for _ molarity _ , _ i.e. _ , number of moles per liter .",
    "l stands for liter . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     since our aim is to understand how polarity patterns arise in a system described by this model , it is appropriate to define an order parameter to quantify the ordering of flux directions or pin intra - cellular localisation .",
    "we thus introduce the two - dimensional _ polarization _ vector @xmath47 for a cell at position @xmath12 ; its components depend on the face - to - face difference of the number of pins along each direction ( say horizontal or vertical ) in the following way : @xmath48 the vector in eq .",

    "between two cells there is exactly one apoplast . in this one - dimensional model",
    ", pin is defined only on the left ( west ) and right ( east ) face of each cell .",
    "given the constraint of conservation of total pin transporters in each cell only two faces contribute , the dynamics of pin numbers are completely determined via the dynamics of @xmath54 and there is just one independent equation for each cell : @xmath55 @xmath56 . furthermore , polarization is no longer a vector but a scalar , given by the first component of eq .",

    "consider the steady - state solutions of the differential equations .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions , one expects some steady states to be translationally invariant .",
    "in that situation , all quantities are identical from cell to cell and from apoplast to apoplast .",
    "we can then drop all time and spatial dependence in the variables , e.g. , @xmath59 for all @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "we consider here an arbitrary translation - invariant configuration of pin transporters ( steady - state or not ) , one has the following equations for steady - state auxin concentrations : @xmath60 these two equations determine @xmath45 and @xmath61 . in apoplasts",
    "there is no source or degradation of auxin , in the steady state the total flux ( transport and diffusion counted algebraically ) through an apoplast vanishes and the same holds for cells . within cells",
    "auxin degradation must compensate exactly auxin production , leading to @xmath62 .",
    "this result , namely @xmath63 , is independent of all other parameters and in particular of the pin polarization and of @xmath7 as illustrated in fig .",

    ", the last equation shows that @xmath61 goes to a limiting value that is strictly positive.(a zoom of fig .",
    "[ fig : auxinvsda ] would also show this is the case . ) solving this equation using the values of the parameters in table  [ tab : parameters ] , one finds that the concentration of auxin in cells is much greater than that in apoplasts because @xmath65 , _ i.e. _ , auxin molecules are more easily transported by aux1 than by pin ( _ cf_. the left limit in fig .",
    "[ fig : auxinvsda ] ) .",
    "one may also consider what happens when diffusion is important ; clearly as @xmath66 , the transporters become irrelevant and the equations immediately show that @xmath45 and @xmath61 become equal . the overall behavior is displayed in fig .  [ fig : auxinvsda ] .     in @xmath8 .",

    "microscopic molecular events associated with auxin transport ( be they active or passive ) arise on very short time scales whereas the pin recycling requires major cellular machinery and so arises on much longer time scales .",

    "the main conclusion to draw from is that as one approaches @xmath76 the number of steady states diminishes .",
    "furthermore , one expects that this effect is accompanied by a reduction in both stability and size of basin of attraction of steady states having defects , leading to an increase of the coherence length ( or domain sizes where a domain is a block of cells having the same sign of polarization ) as one approaches @xmath76 .",
    "such properties naturally lead one to ask whether noise might enhance the coherence of polarization patterns , driving the emergence of order from disorder  @xcite .",
    "since the number of transporter molecules in our system is modest , noise in the dynamics may be important .",
    "the stochastic dynamics are ergodic , so given enough time the system will thermalize , there being a unique `` thermodynamic equilibrium state '' .",

    "nevertheless , here we see that , in the presence of noise , the system seems to have a global polarization , in agreement with the order from disorder scenario  @xcite .",
    "if one refers to the special translation - invariant steady state in the absence of noise , it seems at low @xmath7 that the presence of noise leads to almost exactly the same value of the order parameter , so noise can be thought of as `` selecting '' that particular ordered state .",
    "as @xmath7 grows , polarization intensity decreases and noise effects are amplified . as might have been expected ,",

    "this is inevitable in any one - dimensional system having short range interactions  @xcite , and so no true long - range order arises in this system if the number of cells is allowed to be arbitrarily large . to add credence to this claim , note that the polarization curves are slightly different for the different lattice sizes , the polarization _ decreasing _ as the number of cells increases .",

    "clearly , auxin concentrations are hardly affected at all by pin polarization .",
    "furthermore , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the situation is very close to that in the one - dimensional model .          in the one - dimensional model",
    ", we saw that translation - invariant dynamics of pin polarization followed from when auxin was assumed to be in the quasi - equilibrium state . in two dimensions , there are four dynamical variables which satisfy the conservation law @xmath116 .",
    "each @xmath117 obeys a first order differential equation ; the question now is whether these follow from @xmath70 : @xmath118 the answer is negative : no potential exists because the velocity field has a non - zero curl .",
    "nevertheless , if in the initial conditions the pins obey the symmetry @xmath119 ( or the symmetry @xmath120 ) , then this symmetry is preserved by the dynamics .",
    "( note that the symmetry is associated with reflecting the system of cells an axis . )",
    "then one sees that the differential equations for the two other pin numbers are nearly identical to those in the one - dimensional model .",
    "for instance , if @xmath119 , the equation for @xmath54 is that of the one - dimensional model if one substitutes @xmath44 by @xmath121 .",
    "the difficulty is that @xmath121 itself follows from solving the differential equations and thus can depend on time . although one does not have a true potential",
    ", the important property is that the instantaneous rate of change of @xmath122 can be mapped to its value in the one - dimensional model via the aforementioned substitution .",
    "we thus expect to have the same kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the unpolarized steady state goes from being stable at low @xmath42 to being unstable at high @xmath42 , with an associated appearance of stable polarized steady states .      to determine the translation - invariant steady states , one must solve six simultaneous non - linear equations , two of which give @xmath123 and @xmath124 in terms of the @xmath117 , the other four being associated with pin recycling .",
    "we using mathematica .",
    "qualitatively , one obtains the same behavior as in the one - dimensional model . as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasevsda]b , there is a continuous transition between a polarized state at low @xmath7 and an unpolarized state at large @xmath7 .",
    ", for low values of @xmath42 there is only one steady state and it is unpolarized .",
    "increasing @xmath42 , there is spontaneous symmetry breaking at a first threshold where the unpolarized state becomes unstable and a new polarized steady state appears .",
    "cells in that polarized state have a number of pin transporters on one face and no polarization in the perpendicular direction . because of this last property , the system effectively behaves as a stack of rows which do not exchange auxin , each row being like the polarized one - dimensional system .",
    "surprisingly , a second spontaneous symmetry breaking transition arises at larger value of @xmath42 translation - invariant steady states as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurcation2d ] .",
    "however these states are always linearly unstable and so will not be considered further .        to get a global view of the as a function of both @xmath7 and @xmath42 , we present via a heat map the complete phase diagram in fig .  [ fig : doublephasevsda]b where the norm of the polarization vector is given only for the ( unique ) stable ( and translation - invariant ) steady state .    [ [ section ] ]      the method of introducing molecular noise into the dynamical equations is oblivious to the dimensionality of the model .",
    "thus each dynamical equation can be rendered stochastic for the two - dimensional model without any further thought by following the procedure for the one - dimensional case .",
    "we study state .",
    "once equilibration was observed , we measured the average polarization vector @xmath125 , the average @xmath126 being taken over the whole lattice at one specific time .",

    ", pins tend to distribute quite evenly amongst the faces of a cell and this leads to a relatively flat histogram for the values of @xmath127 ( fig .  [ fig : ergodicityandconfigurations ] ) . however , histogram is a misleading because the polarization vectors @xmath125 have a very small magnitude and in effect each cell is depolarized .",
    ", in degrees , for the regimes of low ( left ) and high ( right ) @xmath7 , accumulated during a simulation of the model using a 10 @xmath129 10 lattice .",
    "bottom : typical equilibrium configurations in those same two regimes . left : @xmath130 @xmath131 .",
    "right : @xmath132 @xmath131 . ]    just as in the one - dimensional case , one may ask whether there is a true transition from a globally polarized state to an unpolarized state when @xmath7 goes from low to high values . a naive way to do so would be to average @xmath125 over the length of the simulation . however , because the dynamics is ergodic , this average should vanish in the limit of a long run .",
    "the same difficulty arises in all systems that undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it is necessary to first take the norm of @xmath125 , then average over time , and finally check for trends with the size of the lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasevsda]h we show this time average , @xmath133 , as a function of @xmath7 for lattices of different sizes . for comparison",
    ", we also show the corresponding curve in the absence of noise .",
    "the behavior displayed is compatible with a true ordering transition as might be expected from the analogy with the behavior of the ising model .",
    "such a behavior is also in agreement with the noise - induced ordering scenario  @xcite and related phenomena @xcite .",
    "although auxin transport in meristematic tissues ( roots , shoots and cambium ) has been actively studied in the past decade while associated molecular actors have been identified , the questions of how intra - cellular pin polarisation arises and how globally coherent polarization patterns emerge have not been sufficiently addressed .",
    "our work is based on modeling both auxin transport across cells and pin recycling within individual cells .",
    "the dynamics we use for pin recycling is modulated by an auxin flux - sensing system .",
    "such recycling allows pin transporters to move within a cell from one face to another .",
    "the pins can accumulate on one face if there is a feedback which allows to maintain itself .",
    "given this framework and estimates for a number of model parameter values , we mapped out a phase diagram giving the behavior in terms of specific parameters . the one - dimensional model , describing a row of cells in a , allowed for large scale pin polarization in the absence of any auxin gradient .",
    "furthermore that toy limit was analytically tractable and correctly described all the features arising in the two - dimensional model .",
    "revealed a particularly essential ingredient : pin polarization requires a sufficient level of _ non - linearity _ in the pin recycling rates . in terms of our mathematical equations ,",
    "this was parametrized by the hill exponent @xmath42 appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq : pinequation ] , .",
    "if michaelis - menten dynamics ( corresponding to @xmath96 ) , the system always goes to the unpolarized state .",
    "when @xmath42 rises above a threshold @xmath84 the homogeneous unpolarized state becomes unstable and polarized pin patterns spontaneously emerge .",
    "we showed that the same qualitative behavior occurs when using non - linearities based on stretched exponentials rather than hill equations ( _ cf . _ supplementary material ) .",
    "that result shows that our model s predictions are robust to changes in assumptions about the dynamical equations .",
    "in addition , by studying the feedback between auxin concentrations and pin recycling , we showed that nearby cells tend to polarize in the same direction .",
    "another particularly striking result found was that the molecular noise in the pin recycling dynamics seems to impose long range order on the pin polarization patterns .",
    "this `` noise - induced ordering '' could be the mechanism driving the ordering found for instance in the cambium , ordering that can span tens of meters in the case of trees .    given that these conclusions follow from our hypothesis that pin recycling is based on flux sensing , experimental investigations should be performed to provide stringent comparisons with our model .",
    "the most direct test of our hypothesis would be to determine whether cells depolarize when the auxin flux carried by pins is suppressed . in _ arabidopsis _ , the polarization of pin can be observed thanks to fluorescent pin transporters so what needs to be done is to apply a perturbation affecting auxin flux .",
    "one simple way to is to inject auxin into an apoplast ; the associated increase in auxin concentration will likely inhibit pin transport into that apoplast .",
    "if such an injection can not be without mechanically disrupting the cell membranes , a less invasive manipulation could be obtained if the aux1 transporters so that they may be locally photo - inhibited .",
    "exposure to a laser beam would then prevent the auxin from leaving a given apoplast , followed by a rapid increase in auxin concentration just as in the simpler experiment previously proposed . in both cases ,",
    "our model predicts that the pin recycling dynamics would lead to depolarization of the cell polarized _ towards _ the apoplast while the neighboring cell , polarized away from the apoplast , would hardly be affected .",

    "these features suggest that auxin steady - state concentrations might be only _ weakly _ dependent on the pin polarizations , whether these are translation - invariant or not , in which case the linearization of the equations should suffice for an accurate description of auxin dynamics .    in this linearization approach , we take pin polarizations to be arbitrary but fixed in time , and we introduce the ( small ) deviations of auxin concentrations compared to a reference state .",
