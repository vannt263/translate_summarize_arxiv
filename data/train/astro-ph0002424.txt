    "hot , massive stars have a major impact on the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , not only at the end of their life when they become supernovae but also throughout their more stable phases of evolution via their strong stellar wind",
    ". the winds of o - type stars can inject as much energy into the ism throughout their main sequence life as in their final explosion , and therefore should have an equally great impact on the structures in the ism and its energization .",
    "typically , wind - blown shells have been found by looking at the environments of stars known to have strong stellar winds , e.g.  o stars and wolf - rayet stars ( e.g.  benaglia & cappa 1999 , marston 1997 , miller & chu 1993 , dubner et al .",
    "1990 ) , but a neutral shell may continue to exist after the central star has evolved off the main sequence and has lost the power to ionize the shell .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are thought to be visible in the radio continuum for only a few to several tens of thousands of years ( braun et al .",
    "1989 , frail et al .",
    "as this is considerably less than the duration of their life before they merge with the ambient ism ( @xmath0 myr ) , there should be many snrs consisting of neutral gas shells .",
    "large scale , low resolution surveys have revealed the presence of supershells ( e.g.  heiles 1984 ) , most likely created by stellar clusters and associations , but could not bring to light the smaller but likely numerous neutral shells created by single stars which are an important part of the galaxy s zoology .    the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ; higgs 1999 and taylor 1999 ) offers the first opportunity to study a large collection of shells , as opposed to supershells , to determine their dynamics and how they relate to and impact on the surrounding ism .",
    "a few such objects were serendipitously discovered in the pilot project ( normandeau et al .",
    "1997 ; hereafter ntd97 ) .",
    "one of these , 132 , will be presented in detail here as an illustrative case study of this class of objects .",
    "it is a striking feature within the data cube , developing over several spectral channels , at velocities generally associated with interarm gas .",
    "the following section briefly outlines the observations and processing of the data .",
    "section 3 provides a description of the structure at several wavelengths . in  4 ,",
    "the possible location of the shell is discussed .",
    "the next section considers the stars present in this vicinity as possible energy sources for a wind - blown bubble . in  6 , all these elements are brought together for analysis and conjecture .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "radio continuum data at 408 mhz and 1420 mhz as well as 21 cm spectral line data were obtained at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) as part the cgps pilot project .",
    "the pilot project covered an 8@xmath1 6  area of the sky , encompassing all of the w3/w4/w5/hb3 galactic complex .",
    "observations were carried out in june , july , november and december of 1993 .",
    "details of observations and data reduction are given in ntd97 except for the 1420 mhz continuum polarisation data which are treated by gray et al.(1999 ) .",
    "table [ tb : obs ] summarizes the observational parameters for the drao data .",
    "the cgps also comprises other data sets which have been reprojected and regridded to match the drao images . among them",
    "is the fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy which is described by heyer et al .",
    "in the images at velocities of approximately 25 there is a well - defined ring of enhanced emission , presumably a shell of atomic hydrogen .",
    "this shell is centred at @xmath2 and will henceforth be referred to as g132.60.725.3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : my_shell ] presents a subsection of the mosaics for the relevant velocity interval .    for a complete expanding shell , the varying line - of - sight component of the expansion velocity from projected centre to rim will result in the constant velocity images in a data cube showing a progression from a small filled ellipse ( the receding cap ) , through annuli of progressively larger radii , then decreasing radii back to a small filled ellipse ( the approaching cap ) .",
    "132 appears to develop from a cap at @xmath3 to a complete ring at 25.27 .",
    "as velocities become more negative it does not progress back to a cap .    at maximum extent 132",
    "is approximately elliptical . the major axis , which is perpendicular to the galactic plane , measures 110.4 arcmin and the minor axis is 95.2 arcmin ; this is equivalent to 71 pc by 61 pc for a distance of 2.2 kpc ( but see  [ sec : distances ] for a discussion of possible distances ) .",
    "there is a hint that the structure is slightly ovoid , being wider nearer to the plane .",
    "for the half of the shell from @xmath4 to @xmath525.27 , the total flux above the background level is @xmath6 .    within the shell at velocities where it is at full extent",
    "there is a filament . at 25.27",
    "it diagonally traverses most of the shell . at more negative velocities",
    ", it persists along with a section of the western edge of the shell , forming a u - shaped structure .",
    "it is centred on ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : g132.60.7_cont ] shows the corresponding area from mosaics of the radio continuum emission at 408 mhz and 1420 mhz .",
    "there is no corresponding ring structure in the radio continuum at either frequency .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol ] shows images of polarized radio emission from the region of the shell .",
    "the emission is displayed in two equivalent forms : stokes q and u images , and polarized intensity and polarization angle .",
    "highly structured emission is seen within 132 . outside of the ring , to the northeast and",
    "northwest the polarised intensity vanishes .",
    "gray et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss the observations of the polarised emission from this region .",
    "polarized structures on arcminute to degree scales are shown to arise from line - of - sight variations in faraday rotation of the diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation field .",
    "the faraday screen of varying magentic field strength and ionized gas density is located primarily in the diffuse interstellar medium of the perseus arm .",
    "the emergent radiation exhibits angular structure in the polarisation angle of the polarised component .",
    "the area to the north of 132 is depolarized due to the high electron density ( and thus rotation measure ) in the ionized halo of the w3/w4 hii region complex ( gray et al .",
    "the appearance of polarised structures along lines of sight within the ring suggests that the bubble is isolated from the depolarising effects of w3/w4 , perhaps because of the surrounding protective shell of neutral gas at the rim .",
    "it is noteworthy that the polarised emission shows structures that are elongated in the northeast - southwest direction and coincident with the hi filament that crosses the centre of the bubble ( see figures 1 and 6 ) .",
    "this similarity suggests either a diffuse electron component mixed in with the hi filament or that magnetic fields play a role in the structure of this low - density environment .",
    "the iras infrared data have been searched for dust counterparts to the atomic hydrogen structure .",
    "the 60 @xmath9 m and 100 @xmath9 m images of this area are shown in figure  [ fig : g132.60.7_iras ] . within the shell , in projection",
    ", there is a clumpy plateau of infrared emission at 60 microns and 100 microns which falls off rapidly at the hi boundary .      within the velocity interval and region of the shell",
    "there are no extended molecular gas structures present in the fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy .",
    "there are relatively compact sources projected onto the eastern rim of the shell at ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) at velocities of approximately 25.2 .",
    "there is also a compact molecular cloud in the lower rim of the shell at ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , 28.5 ) .",
    "the velocities suggest that these are not merely along the line - of - sight towards the rim but are in fact within it .",
    "it can always be argued that any `` object '' seen in images is but a chance superposition of unrelated regions of emission however in this case the accumulated evidence is reassuring .",
    "the gradual progression from cap to full extent in the images , the fall - off of infrared emission outside the shell ( except to the northeast ) , and the signature in the polarisation images , particularly in the polarised intensity , of a clear difference between inside and outside the shell all combine to show that 132 is indeed a single , coherent structure .",
    "assigning a distance or even a relative position along the line - of - sight to 132 is not an easy task .",
    "different possibilities emerge depending on the observational facts considered and the assumptions made .    from the average velocity - longitude plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : vlplots ] ( top panel ) the shell s velocity would place it in the interarm region if each of the main bands of emission is identified with an arm .",
    "however the distribution varies significantly over the latitude range covered by the pilot project . judging from the velocity - longitude plot for @xmath16",
    ", the shell would be at the outer edge of the local .",
    "as for kinematic distances , the shell is completely developed at @xmath17 . assuming a flat rotation curve with @xmath18 and r@xmath19 = 8.5 kpc , one finds d@xmath20 = 1.7 kpc ( burton 1988 ) . using the best fit rotation curve from fich et al.(1989 ) ,",
    "one finds 2.0 kpc .",
    "as was mentioned in the previous section , 132 develops from a cap to full extent over a range of velocities but does not progress back to a cap , i.e.  only half a shell is seen .",
    "the missing second half implies that it must be on a density gradient along the line - of - sight .",
    "the location of 132 on the edge of a spiral arm could account for the absence of the second half : it would have expanded more freely in this direction and would have fragmented and dispersed into the less dense medium . in this context , if the shell is now static , the missing second half indicates that the shell is on the outer edge of the local arm .",
    "however , if the shell is expanding , then the less negative velocities correspond to material which is moving away from us , and the suggestion is then that 132 is on the near side of the perseus arm",
    ". alternately , the missing second half of the shell could be indicative of the expansion in that direction having been forestalled when it encountered a region of higher density .",
    "if this is the case then the shell would either be near the edge of the local arm , the higher density of which would have halted the expansion in that direction , or just past the high - density shocked region of the perseus arm .",
    "a cap would not be visible in this scenario because the material in the second half of the shell would be indistinguishable from the `` wall '' of higher density material which prevented its expansion .",
    "there is absorption associated with the w3 out to @xmath21 ( see e.g.  normandeau 1999 ) , approximately twice the velocity of the shell at full extent .",
    "if both the shell and the absorbing gas at 50 are following the rotation curve of the galaxy then w3 is further away and therefore 132 is at a distance of substantially less than 2.2 kpc , the distance adopted here for w3 . if , on the other hand , the gas producing the absorption at 50 is the shocked gas prescribed by the two - armed spiral shock model ( tass ; roberts 1972 ) then the shell is slightly further than w3 , assuming that it is following the rotation of the galaxy along with the gas at the position of w3 at these velocities . in the tass model ,",
    "the high density gas in the perseus arm has been accelerated from its standard rotation curve velocity of approximately 20 , and gas at 25 or so would be undisturbed gas that is located a little farther than the shocked gas ; the presence of emission rather than absorption at 25 in the spectrum towards w3 supports this idea ( normandeau 1999 ) .    at the velocity where the shell is most clearly seen",
    "there is also interaction between the western edge of the w5 region and the , and there is apparently associated with hb3 from 25.27 to 28.00 and perhaps at 30.21 ( see ntd97 ) .",
    "if this apparently interacting and the forming the shell is all at the distance of w5 and hb3 then 132 would be at @xmath222.2 kpc .",
    "table  [ tb : distances ] summarizes this rather confusing state of affairs . in what follows",
    ", all quantities shall be given with their dependance on distance expressely stated and with the value for a distance of 2.2 kpc in brackets .",
    "this value is preferred for a combination of reasons .",
    "kinematic distances have shown themselves to be unreliable towards the perseus arm ( eliminating entries i and ii of the table ) , tied to the fact that the standard rotation curve does not apply because of observed streaming motions ( eliminating entry iv , as well as vi and ix both of which implicitely assume that all the is following the rotation curve , that decreasing velocity corresponds to increasing distance ) . the tass model is a more promising description of the behaviour of gas towards these longitudes , favoring entry v ( slightly more than 2.2 kpc ) which places 132 slightly past the main ridge of the perseus arm ( entry xi ) .",
    "this is also in accord with the inference that it is at the same distance as w5 and hb3 ( entry iii ) .",
    "there are no visible , catalogued , energetic main - sequence stars within the shell at present ( according to the simbad data base ) .",
    "this is not surprising ; if there were energetic stars present , there should be an inner shell of ionized gas visible in the stokes i images .",
    "figure [ fig : g132.60.7_stars ] shows the positions of the 74 catalogued o and b stars in the vicinity ( in projection ) of 132 with reference to the shell at full extent .",
    "the area searched using the simbad data base was the one displayed in the figure .",
    "the concentration of stars in the lower left - hand corner of the plot is the open cluster stock 2 which is at 303 pc ( mermillod 1999 ) .",
    "a cautionary note should be sounded : if 132 is behind the main ridge of the perseus arm as argued above , then some stars may have been lost to obscuration . however , at these longitudes the plane is at higher latitudes , near @xmath23 , and most of the observed dust emission seems to be associated with the shell rather than being in the foreground .    the most promising candidate for energy source of the shell",
    "if it is wind - blown is bd+60 447 .",
    "this b1 ia star is almost exactly at the centre of the shell in projection , and according to humphreys ( 1970 ) it is at a distance of 1.55 kpc , determined spectro - photometrically from previously published data , which distance is not inconsistent with the various estimates for 132 .",
    "no uncertainty was quoted by humphreys and there was no radial velocity listed . while on the main sequence bd+60 447 was most probably a late o star , which means that it would have had sufficiently strong stellar winds to blow a bubble even though , in its present state , it is no longer capable of maintaining the growth of the shell or its ionization .",
    "other stars within the shell in projection include main sequence b9 and b7 stars , and four unclassified b stars . while these do not provide stellar winds , if they are inside the shell they may be contributing to the expansion of 132 through radiation pressure as discussed by elmegreen & chiang ( 1982 ) .",
    "these authors contend that once a shell has grown sufficiently that it includes many field stars , their radiation pressure will cause the shell s expansion to accelerate .",
    "based on the evolutionary tracks by maeder ( 1990 ) and using the luminosity and effective temperature given by lang ( 1991 ) for a b1 i star , it would appear that bd+60 447 had a mass between 20  and 25  while on the main sequence . according to table 3 of howarth & prinja ( 1989 ; hereafter hp89 )",
    "this implies that it was an o9.5 v or an o9.0 v star . as a lower limit for the energy that could have been input by stellar winds during its hydrogen burning phase , consider an o9.5 v star .",
    "based on the empirical relations derived by hp89 , such a star would have a mass - loss rate of @xmath24 yr@xmath25 and a terminal wind velocity of 2000 , giving a stellar wind luminosity of @xmath26 erg s@xmath25 . from stothers ( 1972 ) ,",
    "the main sequence lifetime of such a star would be 11.2 myr and therefore , the total kinetic energy output would be @xmath27 erg .",
    "it will be assumed that the shell is expanding .",
    "this is the most likely scenario in view of the varying morphology seen in the images .",
    "it is unlikely that there exists , in the ism , a long enough , stationary cylinder or funnel to account for the aspect of the in the different channels .      from its integrated flux , from which a twisted plane background was subtracted , the average column density for the well - defined first half of the shell is @xmath28 .",
    "this implies an mass of @xmath29 [ @xmath30 .",
    "this is in agreement with heiles ( 1984 ) s statistical observation that the mass swept up by a shell is very approximately @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is in parsecs , which in this case would predict @xmath33 [ @xmath34 .    assuming that the cap of the shell is seen at a velocity of @xmath4 and that it has reached full extent at @xmath17 , an expansion velocity of approximately 9.9 is found",
    "this is barely larger than the turbulent velocity standardly assumed for the ism , implying that the shell should soon begin to dissipate into the ambient gas , though the low density of the latter , as evidenced in the image of the shell at full extent , will cause the process to be slower than in denser surroundings . for a complete shell",
    " one with twice the mass of the fore half  to expand with this velocity would require the injection of @xmath35 erg [ @xmath36 erg ] . note that this is the same order of magnitude as the stellar wind kinetic energy of bd+60 447 during its main sequence life .",
    "also , it is low though not unreasonable for a supernova remnant , especially considering that it would have lost energy by now ; @xmath37 erg [ @xmath38 erg ] may have been lost to recombination if all the currently associated with 132 was previously part of an ionized shell .      if the winds from bd+60 447 created and sustained the shell , then 132 would be approximately the same age as the star .",
    "given that fusion stages past hydrogen burning are estimated to last 0.1 times as long as the main sequence ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) , the age of the bubble can not be much greater than the main sequence lifetime of bd+60 447 .",
    "this was earlier estimated to be 11.2 myr based on the assumption that it was of type o9.5 when on the main sequence .",
    "it should be noted that the shell s low expansion velocity and the current evolutionary phase of the central star are in accord with the fact that , in the standard model for wind - blown bubbles ( weaver et al.1977 ) , the time to dissipation into the ism is approximately equal to the main sequence lifetime of the source of the wind .",
    "the shell should at present be in the momentum driven bubble phase , but the transition to this phase would only have been a recent event and therefore it would be best to consider the previous phase , a bubble with a radiative outer shock . according to the standard model , for a bubble with a radiative outer shock the radius varies as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the wind luminosity in units of @xmath41 erg s@xmath25 and the time is given in units of @xmath42 .    by taking the derivative of the above equation and using the radius and age estimates",
    ", one can calculate an expansion velocity for the shell .",
    "a velocity of @xmath43 is predicted and the shell would only have slowed down further as it continued into the momentum driven bubble phase , barring other energy inputs . not only is this significantly less than the observed value but it is also less than the turbulent velocity of the ism and so the shell should have dissipated .",
    "this shell has too high an expansion velocity for its radius and assumed age if it is wind - blown .",
    "the kinematic age of the bubble ( @xmath44 ) , for a constant expansion velocity of 9.9 , is @xmath45 myr [ 3.1 myr ] .",
    "this should be an upper limit to the age of the bubble , unrelated to wind - blown models , as long as there has been no acceleration .",
    "the age estimated from main sequence lifetime of the assumed stellar wind source is much greater than the kinematic age stated above .",
    "bd+60 447 may have been of a somewhat earlier type when on the main sequence , perhaps as early as an o8 , but this does not solve the problem because the age estimate would still be too high , slightly greater than 7.1 myr ( stothers et al .  1972 ) which would require an uncertainty of over 100% on the kinematic age in order for there to be agreement .",
    "this is unlikely considering that there is little uncertainty in the radius , and as for the expansion velocity , the smooth variation of the morphology from channel to channel argues against the estimate of 9.9 being significantly off .",
    "this age disagreement indicates that the stellar winds from this star on its own can not be responsible for the present state of 132 .",
    "if 132 has been mainly formed by bd+60 447 s wind , some other factor must have caused it to accelerate .",
    "expansion into a density gradient and consequent acceleration ( see next section ) , may explain the discrepancy between the observed velocity and that predicted for expansion into a uniform medium .",
    "another possible contributing factor is the radiation pressure from ordinary stars now within the shell , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : stars ] .    for the snr hypothesis , there is no candidate energy source and therefore no presumed age for the 132 .",
    "thus the kinematic age and the expansion velocity do not pose a problem if the shell is a snr rather than a stellar wind bubble .      as stated in  [ sec : hi_descrip ] , 132 is elongated in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane , slightly wider at the base .",
    "this type of shape is expected for a bubble evolving in a density gradient .",
    "the minor axis is 95.2 arcmin ( 61 pc for 2.2 kpc ) .",
    "since any model of bubble evolution in a stratified atmosphere ( e.g.  kompaneets 1960 , tomisaka & ikeuchi 1986 , mac low & mccray 1988 ) predicts near spherical evolution at early times , and significant elongation only when the radius exceeds the scale height ( enabling the bubble to sense the ambient stratification ) , the observed elongation of this shell implies @xmath46 pc [ 30.5 pc ] .",
    "this extremely small value for the scale height is reminiscent of the low value of h ( 25 pc ) found by basu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the nearby ( in projection at least ) w4 superbubble , and of the scale height ( 22 pc ) used by shelton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) when modelling w44 .",
    "a more precise value for the scale height can be found by fitting the analytic kompaneets ( 1960 ) solution to the shell .",
    "the kompaneets solution consists of an analytic expression for the bubble shape at various stages of evolution in an exponential atmosphere .",
    "the observed ratio of major to minor axis can be matched to a kompaneets model at particular stage of evolution , yielding the ratio of the current radius to the ambient scale height .",
    "details of the kompaneets solution and this technique for determining the scale height can be found in basu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for 132",
    ", we find that the best fit kompaneets model has a semi - minor axis @xmath47 .",
    "this yields @xmath48 pc [ 17.3 pc ] .",
    "the general point is that the scale height must be 30 pc or less in this environment , if the elongation is due to a density gradient .",
    "this value is , of course , valid for the ism local to 132 , just as the values relating to studies of w44 and the w4 superbubble were applicable to the environment of these objects .",
    "they do not invalidate the much greater values ( @xmath49 100 pc ) found for the global , galactic scale height , though this is perhaps an indication that the global scale height is determined by very different processes than those that govern the equilibrium of gas on smaller scales .      as was noted in the description of the emission",
    ", there is an `` u '' within the shell . a partial shell within a shell as it were . in the crook of this `` u",
    "'' there is a compact radio continuum source which is positionally coincident with an iras compact source having the colours of an region ( see hughes & macloed 1989 for colour selection criteria ) , namely iras-02044 + 6031 .",
    "the infrared colours , the radio continuum spectral index of + 0.55 and the morphological indication of surrounding the compact source combine to suggest that this an region within a layer of dissociated gas , located on the periphery of the shell .    though originally thought to be a planetary nebula ( acker et al.1983 ) , this identification of iras-02044 + 6031 has since been found to be in error ( sabbadin 1986 , acker et al .",
    "1986 , zijlstra et al 1990 ) .",
    "no maser emission has been detected despite several searches ( 6.7 ghz methanol by macloed et al .",

    "1997 , h@xmath50o maser lines by codella et al .",
    "1996 and by brand et al .",
    "1994 ) , indicating that either the geometry is simply inappropriate for maser detection or that the region has evolved sufficiently that there is no longer maser activity . considering the possibility that the @xmath51 is related dissociated gas , the latter explanation is not unreasonable .",
    "however , it should be noted that the velocity interval sampled by the maser searches did not always cover velocities as high as for the discussed here .",
    "there is no indication of a bright star which could account for the ionized gas .",
    "in fact on the poss images , coincident with the iras source , there is a compact region of increased extinction .",
    "this suggests that this is a young region .",
    "perhaps its formation was triggered by the expansion of the 132 shell .",
    "it should be noted however that wouterloot & brand ( 1989 ) associate this iras source with co emission at 55.7 which would be unlikely to be related to the seen at 25.27 , and the geometry of the region of co emission at 55 is also not suggestive of an association with the .    to summarize , in the context of the larger shell described in this paper , this small u - shaped structure is proposed to be formed by the stars within a compact region through dissociation .",
    "the region itself was perhaps formed when the expansion of 132 compressed gas in its periphery sufficiently to induce star formation .",
    "the u would then be second generation gas related to 132 .",
    "an shell has been found near the very active w3/4 region complex .",
    "the lack of a radio continuum counterpart has been interpreted as indicative of the advanced age of the shell , be it a wind - blown shell or a snr .",
    "if it is a wind - blown shell then the most likely powering source is the b1 supergiant bd+60 447 .",
    "this is based on the position of the star ( at the centre in projection and at a reasonable distance ) and its spectral type ( strong enough stellar winds while on the main sequence to blow a bubble , no longer capable of maintaining the ionization of the shell which is in accord with the lack of a continuum counterpart ) .",
    "the age of the star and the kinematic age of the shell are however discrepant , the former being greater than the latter .",
    "this could point to the shell being a member of the observed class of `` high velocity '' shells ( oey 1996 ) , which have somehow been reaccelerated , but it could also be taken to indicate that the shell was not created by bd+60 447 ( and there are no other catalogued stars present which could have blown the shell through stellar winds ) but is in fact a snr .",
    "based on the available data , it is not possible to distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "regardless of the origin of the 132 , if the elongation of the shell is due to the density gradient of its surroundings , the kompaneets model can be used to determine the scale height of the ambient ism . in this case",
    ", the aspect ratio of the shell indicates that the local scale height is 17.3 pc for a distance of 2.2 kpc . while surprisingly low , analysis of other regions have also pointed to small scale heights ( w4 by basu et al .",

    "it has been hypothesized that this region could be the result of star formation triggered by the expansion of 132 .",
    "compact @xmath52co clouds at other locations along the shell s perimeter could also be triggered or enhanced condensations .",

    "<S> data from the canadian galactic plane survey reveal an abundance of shells and arcs in the disk of our galaxy . while their shape is suggestive of stellar winds or supernovae influence , very few of these structures </S>",
    "<S> have been examined in detail thus far . </S>",
    "<S> a fine example is an shell in the outer galaxy with no continuum counterpart discovered in the survey s pilot project . </S>",
    "<S> its size and kinematics suggest that it was created by the winds of a single late - type o star which has since evolved off the main sequence or by a supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> a b1 ia star at the centre of the shell , in projection , is a possible candidate for energy source if the shell is assumed to be wind - blown . </S>",
    "<S> the shell s shape implies a surprisingly small scale height of less than about 30 pc for the surrounding gas if the elongation is due to evolution in a density gradient .    </S>"
