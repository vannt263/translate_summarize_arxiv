    "the high - resolution blue and far red spectra were acquired as part of an observing run of three nights in 2000 .",
    "they were simultaneously obtained with isis , using the h2400b and r1200r gratings , respectively , on the 4.2 m william herschell telescope . in the blue arm",
    "the spectral range is 4780 - 5200  and in the red arm it is 8360 - 8760 .",
    "the width of the slit is 1  providing a resolution of  0.21 / pix and  0.39 / pix , respectively .",
    "the spatial resolutions are 0.4 and 0.39 arcsec / pix for the blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "three different slit position angles were chosen for ngc3351 to observe 5 cnsfrs and the nucleus ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". in the case of ngc2903 two different slit position angles allow us to study 4 cnsfrs and the nucleus ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for ngc3310",
    "we have observed in two slit positions but we only present preliminary results for one of them .",
    "the images were processed and analysed using iraf routines in the usual manner .",
    "in addition to the galaxy images , observations of 11 velocity template stars were made to provide good stellar reference frames .",
    "they are late type giant and supergiant stars which have strong cat features ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the different methods used to derivate the quantities presented here are explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions are between 30 and 68km / s , about 25km / s larger than those measured for the gas",
    ". however , the best gaussian fits involved two different components for the gas : a `` broad component '' with a velocity dispersion similar to that measured for the stars , and a `` narrow component '' with a dispersion lower than the stellar one by about 30km / s . this last component seems to have a relatively constant value for all the cnsfrs in each galaxy , with estimated values close to 25km / s for the two gas emission lines .",
    "the velocities of the two components of the fits in the cnsfrs of ngc3351 are the same within the observational errors , but in the cases of ngc2903 and ngc3310 we find a shift between the narrow and the broad component that vary between -10 and 35km / s in radial velocity .",
    "the dynamical masses estimated from the stellar velocity dispersion using the virial theorem for the cnsfrs of ngc3351 are in the range between 4.9@xmath4 and 4.8@xmath5m@xmath6 , and is 3.5@xmath5 for its nuclear region inside the inner 11.3pc @xcite . in the case of",
    "ngc2903 the masses are in the range between 6.4@xmath5 and 2.1@xmath7m@xmath6 for the cnsfrs and is 2.2@xmath5 for its nuclear region inside the inner 3.8pc @xcite .",
    "masses derived from the h@xmath1 velocity dispersions under the assumption of a single component for the gas would have been underestimated by factors between approximately 2 to 4 .",
    "masses of the ionising stellar clusters of the cnsfrs have been derived from their h@xmath8 luminosities @xcite under the assumption that the regions are ionisation bound and without taking into account any photon absorption by dust .",
    "their values for ngc3351 are between 8.0@xmath9 and 2.5@xmath4 m@xmath6 for the starforming regions , and is 6.0@xmath9 for the nucleus @xcite . and for the regions of ngc2903 they are between 3.3@xmath4 and 4.9@xmath4 m@xmath6 , and is 2.1@xmath9 for its nucleus @xcite .",
    "these values are comparable to that derived by @xcite for the circumnuclear region a in ngc7714 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the ionising stellar population to the total dynamical mass is between 0.01 and 0.16 .",
    "derived masses for the ionised gas vary between 7.0@xmath10 and 8.7@xmath11 m@xmath6 for the cnsfrs of ngc3351 @xcite , and is 2@xmath10 m@xmath6 for the nucleus , and between 6.1@xmath11 and 1.3@xmath9 m@xmath6 for the regions and is 2@xmath10 m@xmath6 for the nucleus of ngc2903 @xcite .",
    "these values are also comparable to that derived by @xcite .    for ngc3351 ,",
    "the rotation velocities derived for both stars and gas are in reasonable agreement , although in some cases the gas shows a velocity slightly different from that of the stars @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve corresponding to the position going through the centre of the galaxy shows maximum and minimum values at the position of the circumnuclear ring , as observed in other galaxies with cnsfrs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "the differences in velocity between gas and stars can be interpreted as motions of the ionised hydrogen deviating from rotation and consistent with a radial infall to the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "our results are consistent with those found by @xcite and would yield an infall velocity of about 25 km / s .",
    "on the other hand , the observed stellar and [ oiii ] velocities of ngc2903 are in good agreement , while the h@xmath1 measurements show shifts similar to those find between the narrow and the broad components @xcite . this different behavior can be due to that the position of the single gaussian fits are dominated by the broad component in the case of the [ oiii ] emission line while in the case of the h@xmath1 are dominated by the narrow one .",
    "again , the rotation curve corresponding to the position going through the nucleus shows maximum and minimum values at the positions of the circumnuclear regions .",
