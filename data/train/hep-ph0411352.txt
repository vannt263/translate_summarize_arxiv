    "the possibility of baryogenesis by means of electroweak phase transition has recently been widely examined , since the electroweak baryogenesis can in principle be tested in the future accelerator experiments [ 1 ] .",
    "if the electroweak phase transition is strongly first order , it can fulfil the departure from thermal equilibrium which is one of the three conditions required by sakharov that are necessary for the dynamic generation of the baryon asymmetry during the evolution of the universe [ 2 ] .",
    "it has already been observed that in the standard model ( sm ) the electroweak phase transition can not be strongly first order unless the mass of the scalar higgs boson is smaller than its lower bound set experimentally by lep [ 3 ] .",
    "the sufficient strength of the first order electroweak phase transition is essential for preserving the generated baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale . in the literature ,",
    "a number of articles have been devoted to study the possibility of accommodating the strongly first order electroweak phase transition in various models beyond the sm [ 4 ] .    among them",
    ", an interesting possibility has been investigated several years ago , where an extension of the sm with a real higgs singlet field has been adopted within the context of the electroweak phase transition [ 5 ] .",
    "we consider that model is inspiring , because adding a real higgs singlet field is the simplest extension of the higgs sector of the sm . in that model ,",
    "the strength of the first order electroweak phase transition has been stronger than that in the case of the sm . due to the presence of cubic terms in the tree - level higgs potential ,",
    "a strongly first order electroweak phase transition has been ensured for a scalar higgs boson mass of around 100 gev , for the top quark mass of 127 gev .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to reexamine the model in a more rigorous way , in the sense that we perform the full integration of the finite - temperature effective potential instead of approximating it up to second order in temperature , that we include the higgs contributions to the finite temperature higgs potential at the one - loop level , and that we take into account the zero - temperature one - loop higgs potential .",
    "as the experimental lower bound on the scalar higgs boson mass by now is improved to be more than 114 gev , and the top quark mass is usually set as about 175 gev , we would like to explore the parameter space of the model , with these new numbers in mind , where the first order electroweak phase transition may be strong enough . we find that the model is able to produce strongly first order electroweak phase transition for some parameter regions where a scalar higgs boson may have a mass larger than 114 gev .",
    "further , we calculate cross sections for scalar higgs productions in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "let us consider the higgs potential proposed by ref .",
    "[ 5 ] where one real higgs singlet field is introduced to the sm higgs sector .",
    "we follow the notations of ref . [ 5 ] . thus , the higgs potential consists of one complex higgs doublet field @xmath3 and one real higgs singlet field @xmath4 .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are parameters with mass dimension , and the rest are dimensionless .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 , and @xmath11 have a positive values .",
    "the real part of the neutral component of the higgs doublet field is , as in the sm , going to develop the non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath12 while the higgs singlet field @xmath13 .",
    "the tree - level values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 are determined by the extremum conditions @xmath16 where @xmath17 the above extremum conditions are satisfied if @xmath18 we denote the zero temperature values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath21 gev whereas @xmath20 is not fixed but variable .    in this model , there are two neutral scalar higgs bosons . at the tree level ,",
    "the masses for them are given by @xmath22 \\cr      & & \\mbox { }      \\pm \\left [ { 1 \\over 4 }          \\left \\ { - \\mu_{\\phi}^2 + \\mu_s^2 + ( 3 \\lambda_{\\phi } - \\lambda ) u^2      - ( 3 \\lambda_s - \\lambda ) v^2 - \\left ( { \\omega \\over 2 } - 2 \\alpha \\right ) v \\right \\}^2      \\right .",

    "the gauge bosons and the top quark mass are @xmath23 gev , @xmath24 gev , and @xmath25 gev .",
    "they are all defined in terms of @xmath19 , independently of @xmath20 .",
    "now , we consider the one - loop contributions . at the one loop level , the zero temperature effective potential [ 6 ] and the finite temperature one [ 7 ] are respectively given by @xmath26 \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath27 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 account for the degrees of freedom of each participating particles .",
    "the negative sign in @xmath32 is for bosons while the positive sign for fermions .    in @xmath33",
    ", we take the renormalization scale as @xmath34 gev .",
    "the @xmath35 dependence of the potential would disappear if all of higher - order contributions be taken into account .",
    "this is desirable since physical observable quantities should be independent of the renormalization scale .",
    "as we consider only the one - loop contribution in @xmath33 , the scale dependence remains .    in order to reduce the effect of the scale dependence",
    ", one may introduce appropriate counter terms to the one - loop contribution , after regularizing the relevant fields in the effective potential . in our model , the scale dependence on the mass of top quark or on the mass of weak gauge bosons can completely be eliminated in the one - loop contribution .",
    "this is possible because the higgs singlet in our model does not contribute to fermion masses or the weak gauge boson masses .",
    "thus , the one - loop contributions to these masses in our model are exactly identical to those in the sm .",
    "hence , the scale dependence of the one - loop contributions to these masses may disappear if @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is substituted by @xmath37 , where we can neglect @xmath38 .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to replacing @xmath35 by @xmath39 .",
    "the case of the higgs boson mass is more complicated than the case of the fermion masses or the weak boson masses , since the squared mass of the higgs boson at the tree level depends not only @xmath14 but also @xmath15 , and it is given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) which is not in the form of @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants ) . nevertheless ,",
    "comparing with the one - loop contribution to the top quark mass , we might effectively set @xmath35 in the one - loop contribution to the higgs boson mass by either @xmath43 or @xmath44 , in a similar way as @xmath45 in the case of top quark mass .",
    "if a model is related to a new physics at certain scale , the renormalization scale might be taken comparable to the energy scale of the new physics , in order to consider the higher - order effects of the model reasonably .",
    "for example , in a supersymmetric axion model , @xmath35 is taken to be @xmath46 gev in the one - loop effective potential , where new physics is expected to emerge at that energy scale [ 8 ] . in our study , we are interested in the tree - level mass of the higgs boson at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "thus , in our case , we might set @xmath34 gev .    for small @xmath47 , that is , at high temperature",
    ", @xmath32 can be expanded into the well - known form for the temperature induced effective potential .",
    "rather , we perform the integration without using the high temperature approximation in our analysis , in order to consider relatively large scalar higgs boson mass .",
    "the full effective potential that we consider therefore consists of @xmath48 note that the effective higgs potential possesses a symmetry under interchange @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we may confine ourselves within the region of @xmath50 .    in order for the first order electroweak phase transition to take place ,",
    "we need two separate vacua .",
    "the vacua are defined as the points in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath15)-plane at which the higgs potential has local minima .",
    "the two extremum conditions for the higgs potential may be expressed as @xmath51 where the first equation is decomposed such that it is explicitly satisfied by @xmath52 .    in the above expressions , @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "are given as @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath57 note that the negative sign in @xmath58 is for bosons whereas the positive sign is for fermions .",
    "since the first extremum equation is satisfied by either @xmath52 or @xmath59 , one of the two points in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath15)-plane which satisfy the two extremum equations is simply ( 0 , @xmath60 ) where @xmath60 is the solution of @xmath61 .",
    "this is the vacuum of the unbroken phase state .",
    "we solve @xmath61 to obtain @xmath60 numerically by the bisection method .",
    "let the other point in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath15)-plane which satisfies the two extremum equations be denoted as ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , where @xmath64 .",
    "this is the vacuum of the broken phase state .",
    "this point is obtained by the newtons s method .    in order to check that the extremum @xmath65 thus obtained",
    "is minimum indeed , we need a jacobian matrix @xmath66 this point is a minimum of the higgs potential if they satisfy @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the distance between the two minima in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath15)-plane is defined as @xmath69 .",
    "the nonzero @xmath70 ensures that the electroweak phase transition is discontinuous , that is , first order .",
    "the strength of the first order electroweak phase transition is measured by the critical temperature @xmath71 , which is defined as the temperature at which the values of the potential at the two minima are equal : @xmath72 .",
    "we determine @xmath71 by varying temperature @xmath73 until @xmath72 is met .",
    "if the ratio @xmath74 is larger than 1 , the first order electroweak phase transition is defined conventionally as a strong one .",
    "now , let us evaluate the masses of the two neutral scalar higgs bosons from the symmetric @xmath75 mass matrix at the one - loop level .",
    "the masses are evaluated at zero temperature .",
    "thus , @xmath32 does not contribute to the masses at the one - loop level , and we should take @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the final expressions .",
    "the elements of the mass matrix for the neutral scalar higgs bosons are given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are obtained from @xmath81 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "explicitly , they are obtained as @xmath82 and @xmath83 { \\log ( m_{s^0}^2 / m_{\\phi^0}^2 ) \\over ( m_{s^0}^2 - m_{\\phi^0}^2 ) }   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 @xmath85    in terms of these matrix elements , the neutral scalar higgs boson masses at the one - loop level are given as @xmath86 \\ , \\ ] ] which depend on the quartic coupling coefficients @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath11 , and three parameters @xmath20 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 , having mass dimension . here",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath89 .",
    "the quartic coupling coefficients satisfy the condition of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) for perturbation theory to work , in principle .",
    "thus , they are not large . in practice",
    ", we may set their values to be order of 1 or less .",
    "the value of @xmath20 should be comparable to that of @xmath21 gev , because it has a similar property as @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath14 is the higgs field in the sm for @xmath92 and @xmath19 in the sm is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "likewise , we assume that the other parameters @xmath7 and @xmath6 are not so much different from @xmath19 .",
    "since we are interested in the mass region of 200 to 400 gev for the upper bound on the higgs boson masses , we choose the values of the parameters such that they yield the higgs boson masses within this region .    for numerical study , we randomly search the parameter space by varying the relevant parameters within the ranges of @xmath93 , @xmath94 gev , and @xmath95 gev .",
    "starting with a set of relevant parameters whose values are chosen randomly within the allowed ranges , we examine if @xmath96 , which is the criterion for the first order electroweak phase transition to be strong .",
    "if this criterion is met , we continue to calculate the masses of the neutral scalar higgs bosons .",
    "this sequence of calculations produces a point in the ( @xmath97 , @xmath74)-plane or in the ( @xmath98 , @xmath74)-plane . in this way",
    ", we perform calculations to obtain 5000 points . figs .",
    "1a and 1b show the results of our numerical studies on the masses of the neutral scalar higgs bosons . in fig .",
    "1a , the 5000 points thus obtained are plotted in the ( @xmath97 , @xmath74)-plane , and in fig .",
    "1b in the ( @xmath98 , @xmath74)-plane .",
    "notice that the points in the ( @xmath98 , @xmath74)-plane are scattered slightly toward to the right of the plane , as compared to the points scattered in the ( @xmath97 , @xmath74)-plane , since we assume that @xmath89 .",
    "these figures , therefore , indicate that there are sufficiently wide regions in the parameter space where the first order electroweak phase transition is strong as well as the masses of the neutral scalar higgs bosons are relatively large .",
    "we now examine the possibility of detecting these neutral scalar higgs bosons in the future linear @xmath0 collider .",
    "the three main production processes for the neutral scalar higgs bosons in @xmath2 collisions are : @xmath99 where the higgs - strahlung process is dominant at the center of mass energy corresponding to that of lep2 whereas @xmath100 and @xmath101 fusion processes are comparable at much higher center of mass energy , such as that of the future linear @xmath0 collider with @xmath102 gev .    the cross section for @xmath3 or @xmath4 production via the higgs - strahlung process is related to the corresponding production cross section of the sm scalar higgs boson , @xmath103 , as @xmath104 and , similarly , the cross sections for @xmath3 and @xmath4 production via the @xmath100 fusion process or the @xmath101 fusion process are related to the corresponding production cross section of the sm scalar higgs boson , @xmath103 , as @xmath105 where @xmath106 or @xmath101 , and @xmath107 is the mixing angle between the two neutral scalar higgs bosons : @xmath108 these relationships hold because the coefficients for @xmath109 and @xmath110 coupling in our model are respectively @xmath111 and @xmath112 times the @xmath113 coupling coefficient in the sm .",
    "for a given set of parameter values in our model , the above relationships indicate that , in case of the higgs - strahlung process , although neither @xmath114 nor @xmath115 is larger than @xmath116 , they can not be simultaneously smaller than the sm value . if one becomes negligible , the other approaches to the sm value .",
    "the same argument holds in case of the fusion processes . if @xmath117 , the neutral scalar boson @xmath3 in our model would behave like @xmath103 in the sm .",
    "its properties would be identical to those for @xmath103 in the sm .",
    "in particular , if @xmath118 , the lower bound on the mass of @xmath3 would be the same as the lower bound on the sm higgs boson mass , 115 gev , which has been set by the lep experiments .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath119 , the neutral higgs boson @xmath4 in our model would behave like @xmath103 in the sm .",
    "let us consider the higgs - strahlung process .",
    "at the center of mass energy of lep2 , the higgs - strahlung process in the sm is dominant over the fusion processes .",
    "we first calculate both @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and then choose the larger one @xmath120 since at least one of them is comparable to @xmath116 .",
    "we calculate @xmath121 for the each of the 5000 sets of relevant parameter values which produce the points in figs",
    "we plot the result against @xmath97 in fig .",
    "2 . the number of points in fig . 2 is smaller than those in figs . 1 , because those points in figs .",
    "1 yielding @xmath122 gev are kinematically excluded from fig .",
    "2 .    from fig .",
    "2 , the lower bound on @xmath97 might be roughly estimated .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "2 that the lowest value for @xmath97 is about 20 gev .",
    "however , this lower bound on @xmath97 does not take into account the discovery limit . if the discovery limit of the neutral scalar higgs boson @xmath3 in our model via the higgs - strahlung process in @xmath0 collisions at the lep2 energy is , for example , 400 fb , those points above 400 fb should be excluded since lep2 had not discovered @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "then , the lower bound on @xmath97 is pushed upward to about 65 gev .",
    "it is known that the cross section for the sm higgs production via the higgs - strahlung process in @xmath0 collisions at the lep2 energy is about 200 to 250 fb for @xmath123 gev .",
    "assuming that the discovery limit of the @xmath3 production cross section in our model is roughly the same order of magnitude , namely , a few hundred fb , we might estimate that @xmath124 gev .",
    "similar argument would apply to the lower bound on the mass of the neutral scalar boson @xmath4 , if we plot @xmath121 against @xmath98 .",
    "the lep2 experiments have provided detailed , mass dependent , limits on the higgs production and decay cross sections , yielding a limit on the higgs mass as a function of the ratio of the cross section times the branching ratio of its decay into @xmath125 pairs to the sm value .",
    "combined with similar analyses for other decay modes , the lep2 experiments may exclude a higgs boson with mass of order 60 gev even if its production cross section is a tenth of the sm value . in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] , the same analysis has been done independently of the specific hadronic decay mode of the higgs boson . comparing the result of ref .",
    "[ 9 ] with our values , one can conclude that the bound on @xmath97 is indeed of order 60 gev . among the points in fig .",
    "2 , those points with @xmath124 gev and small cross section , lower than 100 fb , are consistent with lep data . however , the key point here is that the lep2 experiments can not exclude the whole points in fig .",
    "this implies that there are parameter regions in our model , where both the electroweak phase transition is strongly first order and the productions of the neutral scalar higgs bosons via the higgs - strahlung process in @xmath0 collisions are consistent with the lep2 experiments .",
    "now , we increase @xmath126 of the @xmath0 collisions up to the proposed ilc center of mass energy of 500 gev . at this energy , depending on the scalar higgs boson mass , the @xmath100 and @xmath101 fusion processes are comparable to the higgs - strahlung process . at this energy ,",
    "the search for the sm higgs boson via the higgs - strahlung process in @xmath0 collision may extend to the mass region up to about 400 gev .",
    "the discovery limit of the cross section for the sm higgs production via the higgs - strahlung process at the ilc of @xmath127 gev is about 3 fb . for our model ,",
    "taking the mixing angle factor @xmath128 or @xmath129 into account , the discovery limit would slightly be larger than the sm one .",
    "it is thus possible to assume that the discovery limit of the cross section for the higgs production via the higgs - strahlung process in our model is less than 10 fb .    at @xmath127 gev , all of the 5000 sets of parameter values we select in figs .",
    "1 are kinematically allowed to produce @xmath3 or @xmath4 in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we calculate the cross sections for @xmath3 and @xmath4 production via the higgs - strahlung process , the @xmath100 process , and the @xmath101 process , namely , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "we also choose in each channel the larger one between the @xmath3 production cross section and the @xmath4 production cross section : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "our results are plotted in figs .",
    "3 - 5 . figs .",
    "3 show the results for the higgs - strahlung process , fig .",
    "3a for @xmath114 , fig .",
    "3b for @xmath115 , and fig .",
    "3c for @xmath121 . for simplicity ,",
    "all of these figures are plotted against @xmath97 .",
    "3c suggests that , at @xmath127 gev , the production cross sections via the higgs - strahlung process are perceivably higher than the discovery limit of 10 fb , for 5000 sets of parameter values in our model .",
    "therefore , these sets of parameter values in our model may be explored at the ilc with @xmath127 gev .    figs .",
    "4 show the results for the @xmath100 fusion process , and figs . 5 for the @xmath101 fusion process .",
    "the production cross sections via the @xmath101 fusion process are generally smaller than those via the other channels .",
    "the production cross sections via the @xmath100 fusion process are considerably large for smaller scalar mass , but rapidly decrease as the scalar mass increases .",
    "these behaviors are expectably consistent with the sm predictions .",
    "successful baryogenesis requires the presence of cp violating sources beyond the ckm phase in the sm .",
    "this is because the ckm phase in the sm can not produce sufficient cp violation for the required amount of the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the higgs sector of our model can not accommodate cp violation since it consists of the sm higgs doublet and a real higgs singlet .",
    "thus , we need sources of cp violation other than its higgs sector . as possible sources of cp violation , scenarios for new physics are good candidate .",
    "assuming the existence of new physics have usually been induced to solve the hierarchy problem .    among various scenarios for new physics ,",
    "two of them can be incorporated with our model [ 10 , 11 ] . in one scenario",
    "[ 10 ] , higher - dimensional interaction terms associated with the higgs doublet may be introduced at the electroweak energy scale . in this case",
    ", the cp violation occurs at the electroweak scale , and the effective yukawa coupling for top quark is given by @xmath137 $ ] , where @xmath138 is a cp violating phase , @xmath139 is a real parameter , and @xmath140 is a cut off energy scale related to the new physics which is much larger than the electroweak energy scale .",
    "[ 10 ] suggests that the energy scale for the new physics might be the majorana mass scale of the right - handed neutrino in left - right symmetric models .",
    "another scenario is more realistic and suitable for our model [ 11 ] , where energy scale for the electroweak phase transition and the energy scale for the cp violation can be made different .",
    "the higgs sector of the model studied in ref .",
    "[ 11 ] has a conventional complex higgs doublet and an extra complex higgs singlet .",
    "the conventional complex higgs doublet play the role of the sm higgs doublet , introducing the sm higgs boson , and the extra complex higgs singlet introduces two additional neutral higgs bosons .",
    "both of the additional neutral higgs bosons are heavier than the sm higgs boson ; one of them stays at the electroweak scale whereas the other has a mass of high energy scale .",
    "thus , among the three neutral higgs bosons of the model , there are two neutral higgs bosons at the electroweak scale and the third one is decoupled from them .",
    "the model considered in ref . [ 11 ] introduces not only the extra complex higgs singlet but also extra vector - like down quark .",
    "the introduction of a vector - like quarks to the sm is attractive since they naturally arise in grand unified theories such as @xmath141 , noted ref . [ 11 ] . in the fermion sector of the model considered in ref .",
    "[ 11 ] , the sm fermions stay at the electroweak scale whereas the vector - like down quark stays at high energy scale",
    ". consequently , the electroweak phase transition occurs at the electroweak scale , whereas the cp violation occurs at high energy scale . in this case",
    ", therefore , the contributions of the heavy third neutral higgs boson and the vector - like down quark in the finite - temperature effective potential are boltzmann suppressed and thus negligible when the electroweak phase transition are considered at the electroweak scale . in other words , the model considered in ref . [ 11 ] becomes effectively identical to our model at the electroweak scale .",
    "actually , by suitably redefining the tree - level higgs potential , and decoupling the third neutral higgs boson , in the model considered in ref . [ 11 ] , it becomes exactly the tree - level higgs potential of our model .",
    "thus , our model for the electroweak phase transition may be extended naturally into the model considered in ref . [ 10 ] in order to accommodate the cp violation at high energy scale , without modifying our study at the electroweak scale .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the tree - level higgs potential come from @xmath142 symmetry breaking terms .",
    "if @xmath143 , these two terms are absent , and the parameter region allowing strongly first order electroweak phase transition disappears .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in fig . 2 of ref . [",
    "11 ] , where @xmath6 is the same and @xmath7 is @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the @xmath142 breaking terms with @xmath145 are crucial for the strongly first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "actually , there should be a potential barrier between two vacua in the tree - level higgs potential in order for the strongly first order electroweak phase transition to occur .",
    "as an example , in a nonminimal supersymmetric model , a trilinear term may be introduced in its tree - level higgs potential to replace the @xmath146-term .",
    "this term allows strongly first order electroweak phase transition in the nonminimal supersymmetric model . also , in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] , one can see that there are a global minimum and a local minimum in the tree - level higgs potential , which become two separate global minima by the contribution of the temperature dependent effective potential .",
    "the sm with an additional real higgs singlet in its higgs sector is studied within the context of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "radiative corrections by the one - loop contribution from gauge bosons , top quark , and the higgs bosons are included , as well as the finite temperature effects .",
    "the one - loop finite - temperature corrections are integrated numerically , instead of employing the high temperature approximation . by randomly choosing a large number of sets of the relevant parameter values within the ranges of @xmath93 , @xmath94 gev , and @xmath95 gev , we select those sets of parameter values that satisfy @xmath96 . for those particular sets of parameter values ,",
    "we calculate the masses of the two neutral scalar higgs bosons of the model and the production cross sections for them via three dominant processes in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we find that there are as much as 5000 sets of parameter values of this model that may accommodate the strongly first order electroweak phase transition , which yield reasonably large masses for the neutral scalar higgs bosons and large production cross sections in @xmath0 collisions with @xmath126 = 500 gev .",
    "thus , for certain parameter values , the prediction on the masses of the neutral scalar higgs bosons are consistent with the present experimental lower bound .",
    "the results of our calculations suggest that this model may be tested in the near future at the proposed ilc",
