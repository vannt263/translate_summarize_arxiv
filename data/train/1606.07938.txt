    "mott insulators with strong spin - orbit coupling can realize novel types of magnetic exchange and low energy hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "it was shown by jackeli and khaliullin@xcite that in materials with strongly spin - orbit entangled effective moments , the low energy effective magnetic hamiltonians would depend on the lattice geometry and could interpolate between purely isotropic heisenberg - like for corner shared octahedra with a @xmath9 transition metal - oxygen - transition metal ( tm  o  tm ) bond , to a bond - dependent quantum compass model for edge shared octahedra with a @xmath10 tm  o  tm bond . for the specific case of a honeycomb lattice , the quantum compass model becomes the kitaev model .",
    "the kitaev model is one of the simplest hamiltonians for spins @xmath11 on a honeycomb lattice which involves bond - dependent nearest neighbor interactions , is exactly solvable , and harbors a quantum spin liquid ground ( qsl ) state with majorana fermion excitations @xcite .",
    "the suggestion that the kitaev hamiltonian and the related kitaev - heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite could be realized in a family of honeycomb lattice iridates @xmath12iro@xmath1 ( @xmath13  na , li ) ) has led to a flurry of activity on these materials @xcite as well as recent work on the honeycomb lattice ruthenate @xmath14rucl@xmath1 @xcite . while the spin - liquid state expected in the strong kitaev limit",
    "has not been found experimentally for @xmath12iro@xmath1 or for @xmath14rucl@xmath1 there has been recent experimental work demonstrating the presence of dominant bond - dependent magnetic exchange and spin - space and real - space locking in na@xmath15iro@xmath1 @xcite , both of which are direct consequences of the presence of kitaev - like magnetic exchange . additionally ,",
    "raman scattering measurements on na@xmath15iro@xmath1 @xcite , li@xmath15iro@xmath1 @xcite and @xmath14rucl@xmath1 @xcite have revealed a broad , quasi - continuous polarization independent response similar to that predicted for the kitaev spin liquid @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a feature in these magnetically ordered materials was interpreted as evidence for proximity to the kitaev spin liquid @xcite .",
    "the novel magnetic properties of these honeycomb lattice iridates and ruthenate most likely arise from the presence of dominant kitaev - like interactions in competition with other residual heisenberg - like or further neighbour interactions .",
    "we recall that bond dependent interactions arise due to the strong spin - orbit coupling and edge shared to@xmath16 ( @xmath17  transition metal ) octahedral geometry .",
    "however , this geometry is common to several other structures and in particular is found in pyrochlore , spinel , and hyperkagome lattices . interestingly ,",
    "iridate compounds are known for each of these structures : @xmath18ir@xmath15o@xmath19 , cuir@xmath15s@xmath0 , and na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this work focuses on the hyperkagome iridate na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 which is a candidate for 3-dimensional quantum spin liquid @xcite .",
    "no long ranged magnetic order was found@xcite down to @xmath20  mk despite strong antiferromagnetic exchange ( @xmath21  k ) between effective spins @xmath11 .",
    "magnetic irreversibility below @xmath22  k hints at a glassy state @xcite which is confirmed by @xmath23sr and neutron diffraction measurements @xcite and by @xmath24na and @xmath25o nmr measurements @xcite .",
    "however , properties above the freezing temperature are consistent with a spin liquid state @xcite . whether the spin - glassy state is a result of disorder or due to several competing magnetic states is yet to be ascertained .",
    "the ground state of ideal na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 samples may yet be a qsl .",
    "there have been several attempts@xcite to arrive at a minimal spin model that would best describe na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 . in most of these works",
    "predominantly the heisenberg model on the hyper - kagome lattice has been explored .",
    "a recent study@xcite has explored the kitaev - heisenberg model on various lattices with edge shared octahedra including the hyperkagome lattice relevant for na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it is found that while the kitaev spin - liquid exact solution does nt generalize to this lattice , a quantum phase with extensive degeneracy is found in both limits of strong kitaev or strong heisenberg , with a 3d stripy order in between @xcite .",
    "the stripy magnetic order has clearly not been found in experiments on na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "however , most thermodynamic measurements suggest proximity to a spin liquid state . which limit ( kitaev or heisenberg ) is more appropriate for the real material is thus still an open question .",
    "we have measured the raman response of high quality polycrystalline pellet samples of na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "in addition to first order phonons we find a broad band with a maximum at @xmath3  3500 @xmath4 and with a band - width @xmath5  @xmath4 .",
    "the broad band has some additional structure in contrast to the featureless response found earlier for na@xmath15iro@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "to understand these observations and to try to throw light on whether heisenberg or kitaev like interactions are dominant in na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 we have computed the raman response for the nearest - neighbour kitaev - heisenberg model in both the strong heisenberg and kitaev limits .",
    "the raman response was calculated using the majorana mean field framework assuming a spin liquid ground state for both limits . for the heisenberg limit",
    "we find two peaks with relative intensity that does not match the experimentally observed raman response",
    ". even on introducing small kitaev terms as perturbation does not give results which match our experiments .",
    "for the pure kitaev limit we obtain a broad band response .",
    "there are however , additional features in the experiments which suggest the presence of other terms .",
    "hence we finally added small heisenberg terms and find that additional peaks which develop , match the experimental observations .",
    "although the kitaev limit is not exactly solvable for the hyperkagome lattice we find a spin - liquid state for the parameters used to calculate the raman response which match the experiments .",

    "raman spectra recorded with a different laser line ( 488 nm ) at 300k shows the same mode without any frequency shift as shown in figure  [ fig - raman-77k ] ( b ) and hence rules out the broad band to be related to photoluminescence .",

    "the possibility of the brb being a two magnon peak is unlikely since the system does not order magnetically .",
