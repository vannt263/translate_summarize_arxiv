    "the deepest extragalactic surveys for infrared luminous galaxies have been carried out at 15@xmath0 m with iso and 24@xmath0 m with spitzer , due to the fact that the confusion of point sources and of background cirrus emission is more serious in longer wavelengths . a key result from iso surveys",
    "may be summarised in the differential number counts at 15@xmath0 m , which have a characteristic bump at around 300@xmath0jy . with these number counts",
    ", pure density evolution models are clearly rejected , and strong luminosity evolution with @xmath9 is suggested at @xmath10 .",
    "recently , this strong luminosity evolution at @xmath10 has been confirmed by spitzer with much greater statistical significance @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength surveys at _ both _ 15 and 24@xmath0 m are not just redundant observations , but reveal the problems in our understanding of distant infrared galaxies .",
    "although the differential number counts at 24@xmath0 m are found to be similar in shape to the 15@xmath0 m counts , it is not straightforward to explain the 24@xmath0 m counts with the phenomenological models of galaxy counts constrained to fit the multi - wavelength counts prior to the spitzer results .",
    "the peak in the 24@xmath0 m differential counts is found at 200  300@xmath0jy ( in @xmath11 ) which is fainter than expected from models of galaxy counts .",

    "since at 15 and 24@xmath0 m we observe the pah emission features of galaxies at @xmath121  3 , we need sed templates with realistic pah emission features as a function of luminosity for galaxies at @xmath13 . unfortunately ,",
    "such sed templates are not yet available .    with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) onboard spitzer , mir features of high-@xmath8 galaxies , such as the pah emission feature and silicate absorption feature , become accessible @xcite , although the observed samples are still very limited .",
    "the highest redshift pah detection has been reported in an infrared - luminous lyman break galaxy at @xmath14 @xcite , which is likely to be a hyperluminous infrared galaxy .",
    "currently , the prime high-@xmath8 targets for irs seem to be submm galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is rather surprising that pah emission features are detected in most submm galaxies , given that they are typically hyperluminous ( @xmath15 ) galaxies which are in the local universe generally agn - dominated galaxies .",
    "there is already a hint that the mir properties of high-@xmath8 galaxies are systematically different to those in the local universe .",
    "more systematic studies on this issue are clearly needed .    with spitzer surveys ,",
    "the majority of hyper- and ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( hy / ulirgs)lirgs defined with @xmath16[@xmath17 , 12  13 ] , where @xmath18 is the luminosity in the wavelength rage from 8 to 1000@xmath0 m . ] targets at high redshifts may be derived from the 24@xmath0 m source catalogues .",
    "this may result in incomplete samples of ulirgs specifically at @xmath19 , at which ulirgs with strong silicate absorption become very faint in the 24@xmath0 m band @xcite . @xcite",

    "see @xcite for details on the survey design of the nep - deep and nep - wide surveys .    with this comprehensive wavelength coverage ,",
    "one clear benefit for extragalactic mir surveys is that a more reliable selection for high-@xmath8 ulirgs becomes possible , as noted above . in a flux limited sample with spitzer mips 24@xmath0 m ,",
    "it is likely that some fraction of ulirgs at @xmath19 are missed , owing to redshifted silicate absorption features .",

    "this parameter setting for sextractor is a result of our optimization to detect reliable point sources and avoid fainter extended sources which are likely to be residuals of the background subtraction .",
    "we have detected 72 sources in the area of 50.2 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "since all of the 18@xmath0 m sources are found to have a counterpart at other irc bands , the reliability of the detected sources is very high .",
    "we applied the same source detection method for the negative @xmath37 image , and detected only 5 sources . from an inspection of the negative image , it is obvious that they are not point sources like those detected in the positive image , but rather a result of the negative extended pattern caused by the residuals of the sky subtraction .",
    "we also used the negative @xmath37 image to estimate the typical photometric error . on the negative @xmath37 image",
    ", we performed aperture photometry at random source - free positions ( determined in the positive image ) using the same procedure as with detected sources ( see below ) .",
    "the distribution of flux measured at random positions has the standard deviation of 25@xmath0jy , which represents a typical photometric error .",
    "we note that the faintest source in our catalogue has the flux of 129@xmath38@xmath0jy . in the other irc bands",
    ", we identified the counterparts of the detected 18@xmath0 m sources by using the sky coordinates from sextractor .",

    "if the newly - determined centroid is shifted from the original position by @xmath39 , we rejected such a source as the counterpart of the 18@xmath0 m source .",

    "we visually inspected the result of the cross - identifications in postage stamp images ( shown in figures [ image1 ] & [ image2 ] for the colour selected sample , see below ) , and verified the correctness of the cross - identifications .",
    "we performed aperture photometry at the centroid positions of the 18@xmath0 m sources and their counterparts in our irc images .",
    "we used aperture radii of 2 and 3 pixels for the nir and the mir - s / l images , respectively . note that in the flux calibration of the irc images with standard stars , aperture radii of 10 and 7.5 pixels were used for the nir and mir - s / l channels , respectively .",

    "have been used which are detected in the observations for the nep - wide survey .",
    "we found that the measured fluxes in the coadded nir and mir - s images are systematically lower than those before coaddition .",
    "this is because we coadded the images , which have elongated psfs , with various position angles using a simple median . using the empirical psfs , we generated ` coadded ' psfs adopting the same position angle of the actual observations .",

    "the irc monitor field lies inside the nep - deep survey area and is covered by the deep @xmath43 optical observations with subaru / s - cam , reaching @xmath44 to @xmath45 ab mag in @xmath46 ( wada et al .",

    "we analyse the seds of both 14 normal star - forming galaxies and 11 agn candidates using the sed model of starbursts with radiative transfer ( sburt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the contribution from agn is not taken into account in sburt , it is expected that the seds of agn candidates show an excess in the mir , owing to hot dust around the central massive black hole , while the best - fit model for normal star - forming galaxies would be largely acceptable .",
    "we find the best - fit sed model from the prepared set of 540 sed models at various redshifts with different starburst age ( 0.01  0.6 gyr ) , the compactness of the starburst region @xmath67 and the extinction curve ( mw , lmc and smc type ) .",
    "the compactness of starbursts is defined by @xmath68 [ kpc ] , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the radius and stellar mass of the starburst region , respectively .",
    "note that the attenuation due to dust or @xmath71 is a function of starburst age , peaking at @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an evolutionary time - scale of starbursts taken to be 100 myr .",
    "also , the more compact the starburst region , i.e.  smaller @xmath74 , the larger the attenuation .",
    "the adopted sed models are the same as those used in @xcite for the sed analysis of submm galaxies .",
    "we searched for the best - fit sed model by @xmath75-minimization .",
    "considering the flux uncertainty with the irc images and systematic errors between ground - based and space photometry , we set minimum flux errors at each photometric band , i.e.  5% for optical bands ( @xmath43 ) , 10% for @xmath47 and @xmath52 , 15% for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , 30% for @xmath42 and @xmath76 , and 20% for the other longer irc bands .",
    "we have put larger minimum errors on @xmath42 and @xmath76 bands , since a systematic error on calibration is indicated from the sed of stars in our field ( see also lee et al .",
    "since these minimum errors are chosen as the most conservative limit , the derived values of @xmath75 can be regarded as the lower limits .    at rest frame uv wavelengths ,",
    "the seds of starbursts could depend on the small scale geometry of gas / dust and stars resulting in the leakage of uv photons and affecting the resulting sed ( c.f .",
    "also note that the extinction curve is not well understood in starbursts in the uv .",
    "therefore , considering these uncertainties in the sed model , we quadratically added an additional 20% error for data at rest - frame uv wavelengths , @xmath774000 , in order to reduce the statistical weight of data at the rest - frame uv .",
    "the adopted flux errors for the sed fitting are shown in figure [ sed1 ] and [ sed2 ] .",
    "we reject the sed model if the value of @xmath75 is significant at @xmath78% level .",
    "figures [ sed1 ] and [ sed2 ] show the best - fit sburt model for normal star - forming galaxies and agn candidates respectively , including those rejected with a large @xmath75 value ( shown as dotted lines ) . as expected , most of the agn candidates have power - law - like seds ( see however id25 as discussed below ) . according to the @xmath75 values",
    ", sburt has no acceptable best - fit model for 4 out of 14 star - forming galaxies , while 7 out of 11 agn candidates can not be explained by sburt . for the majority of galaxies with no acceptable sed model ,",
    "the large @xmath75 is attributed to the excess of observed fluxes in more than 2 mir bands , compared to the best - fit sed model .",
    "the detection of the mir excess , probably due to the hot dust component around the central massive black hole , is reliable , thanks to the comprehensive wavelength coverage in the mir .",
    "all the accepted models for agn candidates ( id14 , 35 , 64 , and 72 ) underestimate the mir fluxes as well , but this does not much contribute to the @xmath75 value , due to the large minimum error ( 30% ) for @xmath42 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , if more accurate photometry becomes possible for these bands , the rejection rate for agn candidates could reach @xmath79100% .",
    "this result indicates that the simple colour selection of agn candidates with akari bands is consistent with the more sophisticated diagnostics using the sed fitting .",
    "assuming all of the agn candidates selected with @xmath3 and @xmath65 are indeed agn , we estimate the agn fraction of 18@xmath0m - selected galaxies to be 15@xmath80% ( 11/72 ) in number or @xmath7912% in total flux .",

    ", galaxies with anomalous pah inter - band ratio may exist in greater number than expected from the local universe .",
    "* id25 : * although this galaxy is classified as an agn candidate , its sed is not characterized by a simple power - law .",
    "the 1.6@xmath0 m bump falls in between @xmath96 and @xmath42 bands , suggesting that stellar emission dominates in this wavelength range . from 7@xmath0 m",
    ", there is a very steep rise in flux towards longer wavelengths which can not be reproduced with the sburt models .",
    "* id26 : * this is an extremely red object with @xmath97 ( 6.3 in vega ) , and too red for the sburt models within the reasonable parameter range for the sed fitting .",
    "interestingly , the sed fitting with _",
    "hyperz _ indicates that this is a young ( 40 myr ) and heavily obscured ( @xmath98 ) galaxy at @xmath99 . also , this galaxy has the bluest @xmath100 colour in our sample , i.e.  good candidate of silicate - break galaxy at @xmath101 ( see section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "* id65 : * this galaxy has a very steep power - law sed with the optical - to - ir slope of @xmath102 when @xmath103 .",
    "this is very close to the maximum limit on the steepness for agn seds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed a new selection technique of high-@xmath8 ulirgs by using the akari / irc multi - wavelength survey , in which the colour anomaly in the mir bands due to the silicate absorption feature is used .",
    "galaxies found with this method are called silicate - break galaxies . @xcite adopted this technique by using spitzer 16@xmath0 m ( irs ) and 24@xmath0 m ( mips ) observations .",
    "they found 36 candidate silicate - break galaxies probably at @xmath104 in 0.0392deg@xmath1 , corresponding @xmath105 sources deg@xmath1 .",
    "here we attempt to identify silicate - break galaxies with our data . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the key wavelength for this selection method is 24@xmath0 m .",
    "unfortunately , our 24@xmath0 m image is not deep enough to employ the silicate - break technique .",
    "instead , we use @xmath95 and @xmath37 .    in figure [ sbg ] , we show the colour - colour plot of @xmath6 vs.  @xmath100 . according to @xcite , we could select ulirgs at @xmath101 with @xmath106 , but we would suffer from the contamination from normal spiral galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "we use a colour cut of @xmath3 again to exclude the contamination from low-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "we find that seven 18@xmath0m - selected galaxies satisfy @xmath3 and @xmath107 .",
    "five out of seven , id15 , 16 , 26 , 58 and 60 , have @xmath108 , and are likely to be star - forming galaxies . except for id16 and 58 , photometric redshifts ( from both sburt and _ hyperz _ ) are consistent with the redshift expected from the silicate - break selection , i.e.  @xmath101 . id16 and 58 have @xmath109 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "these low-@xmath8 contaminants are expected , since the single colour cut @xmath3 is only useful for a rough selection of galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "such contaminations would be reduced if we use a colour selection with 18 and 24@xmath0 m as suggested by @xcite .    as noted in section [ nature ] , no best - fit sed models for silicate - break galaxies have strong silicate absorption .",
    "so , they are not silicate - break but ` pah'-break galaxies . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "show that the sed of a silicate - break galaxy selected with the spitzer irs peak - up imager can be reproduced by an sed model with a strong silicate absorption feature .",
    "this galaxy is a submm galaxy and therefore more luminous than our 18@xmath0m - selected galaxies . with deeper and wider mir - l observations",
    ", we would find ulirgs at @xmath5 with silicate absorption , i.e.  true silicate - break galaxies .",
    "more studies on the nature of silicate - break galaxies will be given elsewhere using the main nep survey .",
    "we investigated akari 18@xmath0m - selected sources by using all nine irc photometric bands , as a pilot study for the main akari nep survey . by using the irc observations for the monitor field",
    ", we detected 72 18@xmath0 m sources from the area of 50.2 arcmin@xmath1 . in order to select galaxies at @xmath2 , i.e.  the main targets for the nep survey , we employed a simple colour selection , @xmath110 and obtained a sub - sample of 25 .",
    "agn candidates in this sub - sample are identified with another colour cut , @xmath111 , which implies a hot dust component .",
    "the resulting sample has 14 star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 and 11 agn candidates with power - law like seds .",
    "we analysed both star - forming galaxies and agn candidates with a radiative transfer sed model of starbursts , sburt @xcite . since the sburt model does not include an agn component , the presence of an agn can be assessed by the excess of observed flux at the mir wavelengths due to hot dust around the central massive black hole .",
    "we found that our agn candidates show mir excesses compared to the best - fit sed models , most of which are rejected at the significance of @xmath112 by the resulting large @xmath75 value .",
    "this means that the simple colour selection for agn candidates is consistent with the more sophisticated diagnostics with the sed model .",
    "an interesting future project would be sed analysis with more complicated models having both starbursts and agn .    with the sed fitting",
    ", we obtained photometric redshifts using optical - to - mir seds , which are largely consistent with ground - based optical - nir photometric redshifts .",
    "we demonstrated that the steep rises in flux corresponding to the blue - side of the pah 6.2@xmath0 m feature and also the flux dip between the pah 7.7 and 11.2@xmath0 m features are recognizable in the resulting seds by irc .",
    "the irc all - band photometry is probed to be useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies using the mir spectral features .",
    "typically , @xmath6-selected 18@xmath0 m sources are ( u)lirgs at @xmath5 with masses @xmath113 . no ulirg in our sample has strong silicate absorption according to the best - fit sed model .",
    "this may suggest a systematic difference in the nature of ulirgs at low and high redshifts , or may be a simple selection effect , owing to the faintness of ulirgs with strong silicate absorption .",
    "we could test these hypotheses with deeper irc all - band surveys such as the nep - deep survey .",
    "this pilot study demonstrates well the interesting new capabilities of the akari nep survey , compared to the existing infrared surveys by spitzer .",
    "the irc all - band photometry would be a powerful and unique tool to constrain the redshifts of optically faint heavily obscured galaxies .",
    "we may find many candidate examples of infrared galaxies with anomalous pah inter - band strength ratio .",
    "furthermore , unique samples of ulirgs at @xmath101 will be constructed with the silicate - break selection technique .",
    "such samples could play an important role in revealing the nature of high-@xmath8 ulirgs , which should provide vital clues on the process of galaxy formation .",
