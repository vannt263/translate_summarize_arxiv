    "the principal aim in introducing nonlinear electrodynamics was to eliminate the coulomb divergences that arose in maxwell electromagnetism .",
    "one such prominent member of this class of theories was introduced by born and infeld ( bi ) in 1934 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic action of the bi theory consisted of a square root term under which the electromagnetic field strengths admitted automatic upper ( lower ) bounds .",
    "this is reminiscent of the relativistic particle lagrangian where the upper bound turns out to be the speed of light . in the proper limiting procedure",
    "one naturally recovers from the bi formalism the linear electromagnetism of maxwell as expected .",
    "one problem that was invited with the bi theory was the double - valued behavior of the displacement vector @xmath1 as a function of the electric field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "that means , with the same @xmath2 value at a particular point one could obtain two different values for @xmath3  ; a totally unacceptable situation from the physics standpoint . to resolve this problem , shortly after the introduction of bi theory , hoffmann and infeld introduced a supplementary term to the bi lagrangian @xcite which came to be known as the hoffmann term. this amounted to a pair of lagrangians matching at a natural boundary , removing the double - values in @xmath4  , but all at the cost of two lagrangians in the same theory .",
    "these novel ideas of 1930s may find appropriate arena now in the geometric theory of einstein , namely the general relativity since boundaries / intersections of different spacetimes are encountered therein naturally . from this token we developed a geometric model of a particle",
    "where the outside and inside of the particle correspond to different spacetimes matching consistently at the radius of the particle @xcite .",
    "this took place in the @xmath5 dimensional @xmath6 spacetime , but naturally we can extend the investigation also to nowadays fashionable @xmath7 spacetimes @xcite . in this paper instead of",
    "@xmath7  we shall go the opposite route , namely to @xmath8 spacetimes and investigate in the presence of the hoffmann term the impacts of the bi electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this suggests that beside its historical importance the bi and hoffmann terms together constitute viable a physical model .",
    "our lagrangian is shown ( in the appendix ) to satisfy the weak ( wec ) and strong ( sec ) energy conditions .",
    "gravity coupled bi electrodynamics in @xmath9-dimensions alone is known to be singular @xcite .",
    "some other forms of the non - linear electrodynamics coupled with gravity in @xmath0dimensions , also reveal that the possible black hole solutions are singular @xcite .",
    "our model consists of the einstein - hilbert , cosmological @xmath10 and bi terms which are supplemented by the logarithmic hoffmann term .",
    "as we had shown in our particle model @xcite the hoffmann term serves to introduce a natural boundary term so that the spacetime can be considered divided in two different regions . the inner part which is singularity - free turns out to contain a uniform electric field in addition to the cosmological constant overall which is nothing but the anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "the outer part is an entirely different spacetime which matches according to the israel s junction conditions @xcite on the circle , identified as the @xmath11 dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .    an important result that we obtain within the context of einstein - hoffmann- born - infeld ( ehbi ) theory in @xmath8",
    "is that we can construct regular , charged black hole solutions .",
    "this particular point constitutes the main motivation for this letter .",
    "let us note that cataldo and garca @xcite found a regular , charged btz black hole without identifying an initial lagrangian for the nonlinear electromagnetism . unlike the bi case in the absence of such a lagrangian we ca nt investigate its implication in a flat spacetime limit as well as the underlying thermodynamic properties . for the latter analysis we appeal to the @xmath12-dimensional dilaton gravity model within the kaluza - klein formalism . in this sense our work can be considered as an alternative , charged singularity - free construction of the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "as the charged btz black hole has singularity at @xmath13 , with the bi and hoffmann terms in the action , it eliminates the singularity to yield a regular black hole solution .",
    "expectedly , in proper limits the boundary circle is removed and our spacetime reduces to the uncharged , non - singular btz black hole . although , it does not allow us to interpret such a solution as a particle model it may serve as a toy model in @xmath8 , which can be extended to higher dimensions as a tool to eliminate naked singularities and restore the cosmic conjecture hypothesis , for instance . further ,",
    "inclusion of the hoffmann term may constitute an attractive field theory model of elementary particles .",
    "technically , by the choice of parameters of the theory ( i.e. bi parameter @xmath14 , electric charge @xmath15 , mass @xmath16 and the cosmological constant @xmath17 ) we can adjust the event horizon to be located inside / outside the circle whose radius is at @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( 7 ) below ) . for @xmath19 @xmath20",
    "the spacetime is regular with negative scalar curvature @xmath21 . by numerical analysis",
    "we obtain solutions with single / double ( or no ) horizons which are displayed in fig .",
    "our @xmath22dimensional action in einstein - hoffmann - born - infeld ( ehbi ) theory , is given by ( @xmath23)@xmath24 in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 in which @xmath14 is a real parameter ( hbi - parameter ) .",
    "the additional @xmath27 term is known as the hoffmann term which supplements the more familiar bi lagrangian .",
    "also the limit of the lagrangian once @xmath28 yields the einstein maxwell linear electrodynamics as@xmath29and in the other limit once @xmath30 it goes to gr limit .",
    "the metric ansaetze are axially symmetric which are given by @xmath31 in which @xmath20 is the constant boundary to be determined .",
    "we comment here that these two spacetimes are glued at @xmath32 the electric field two - form is chosen as@xmath33and the nonlinear maxwell equation implies@xmath34    consistent solution in both regions for the electric field is given by @xmath35 in which @xmath15 is the electric charge and @xmath18 is the radius of a circle dividing the regions .",
    "let us also add that for @xmath36 the square - root term vanishes and @xmath37 reduces to a constant which may be added to the cosmological constant @xmath38 that is , for @xmath39 we have the anti - de sitter spacetime . from the expression ( 6 )",
    "it can be seen that the electric potential is    @xmath40    it is seen that @xmath41 at @xmath42 @xmath43 is also zero ( and similar result holds when @xmath44 ) which means that @xmath43 in terms of @xmath45 is single valued .    the energy density @xmath46 @xmath47 can be integrated to find the total energy , which diverges for  @xmath48    variation of the action with respect to @xmath49 yields the einstein equations@xmath50where @xmath51and in a closed form it reads@xmath52 .\\]]for @xmath53 the only nonzero component of the einstein tensor @xmath54 is @xmath55 in which the @xmath56 and @xmath57 parts of the einstein equations simply read @xmath58which clearly imposes @xmath59 or equivalently @xmath60since @xmath61 and this will be used wherever necessary .",
    "let us note that the relation between the two constants @xmath62 and @xmath14 is not a choice but is a direct consequence of the einstein equations .",
    "the other @xmath63 component of the einstein equation for @xmath64 admits a solution which takes the form@xmath65on the other hand the einstein equations for @xmath66  give the metric function@xmath67 , & r\\geq r_{0}% \\end{array}%\\]]in which @xmath16 is the adm mass of the black hole and @xmath68 is a constant introduced for dimensional reasons and , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are integration constants to be found below .",
    "once more we note that    @xmath71    which removes the inner region automatically since @xmath72 and leaves us with the charged btz ( cbtz ) black hole .",
    "the other limit is given by @xmath73 which is the non - rotating btz ( nbtz ) black hole , namely @xmath74    now , the boundary surface @xmath75 can be considered as a @xmath11dimensional frw circular spacetime i.e.,@xmath76 in which @xmath77 is the proper time on the circle .",
    "furthermore , the two metric functions in ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) must fulfill the israel junction conditions @xcite reading@xmath78where @xmath79 is the stress energy tensor on the boundary , @xmath80 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath81 is the trace of it and @xmath82 one can show that the israel equations read@xmath83where a prime is a derivative with respect to @xmath84 . a smooth transition from @xmath85 into @xmath39",

    "our metric gives rise , through numerical analysis to different black holes ( see fig .",
    "the interesting case is the one with event horizon from @xmath94 and an inner horizon from @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "the fact that our darkness function for the common parameters satisfies black hole condition , both outside and inside , can be seen from the numerical plots .",
    "as we found at the end of the previous section , the origin is nonsingular .",
    "it should be noted that the tidal force may reveal a singularity even when the curvature invariants are finite .",

    "in this section we follow @xcite to study the thermodynamics of the ehi black hole found above . to do so we derive the solution ( 15 ) for @xmath104 from the dilaton gravity .",

    "efectively , this restricts our analysis to the fixed charge ( canonical ) ensemble , as that parameter can no longer be varied @xcite . to have at least one horizon one should set @xmath146 so that @xmath147 indicates the outer horizon at which the hawking temperature is defined by@xmath148    the heat capacity and free energy",
    "are given respectively by@xmath149and@xmath150which complete the thermodynamical analysis of our ehbi black hole .",
    "we note that , in this stage we can not take the limit @xmath151 ( which is cbtz limit ) because we have set some of our constants in terms of each other to satisfy the israel boundary conditions . instead , to use these results we may keep our parameters as they appeared before our conditions are imposed and then our results provide the correct cbtz limit i.e. , @xmath152and the same for the other cases .",
    "nevertheless with the limit @xmath153 ( i.e. @xmath72 ) it automatically removes the inner space .",
    "this leads to the case that we do nt need to consider any boundary conditions and therefore the relation between @xmath154 and @xmath14 will no longer be needed . under these circumstances",
    "we can use the above limits .    through the explicit expressions of @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157",
    "one simply finds that by a rescaling @xmath158 one can eliminate @xmath14 from the expressions .",
    "this means that the different values for @xmath14 ( with fixed @xmath159 does not change the general behavior of the thermodynamical properties .",
    "in such case we set @xmath160 and plot fig.s 1 and 2 without loss of generality of the problem .",

    "now , with the additional hoffmannn term in the bi lagrangian an alternative method of gluing different spacetimes renders construction of regular black holes possible . as explained , the role of the hoffmann term , is to introduce a natural circle as boundary with radius @xmath168(with @xmath169electric charge and @xmath170bi - parameter ) which divides spacetime into inside ( @xmath53 ) and outside ( @xmath104 )  regions . in the process of matching of spacetimes at the junction",
