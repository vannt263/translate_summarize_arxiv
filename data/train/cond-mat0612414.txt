    "thermoelectric materials are the subject of intense research because of their potential for efficient power generation and cooling .",
    "the efficiency of the thermoelectric material is measured by the figure of merit , @xmath5 , defined by several interdependent physical parameters.@xcite it is difficult to get a high zt material due to the competing requirements for optimizing the interdependent parameters .",
    "many efforts have focused on reducing the thermal conductivity @xmath6 , without sacrificing electrical conductivity , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 is the sum of the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath8 and the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath9 .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies suggest that materials that show nano - phase separation appear to be promising in achieving high performance.@xcite    the material with composition pbte@xmath10s@xmath11 shows a very low room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 0.4  w / m  k and a @xmath5 value significantly higher than that of pbte and pbs.@xcite the thermal conductivity is only 28% of that observed in the pbte system , which is remarkable given that the two are isostructural and pbte@xmath10s@xmath11 has only 16 at .",
    "% of s substituted on the te site .",
    "understanding the origin of this remarkable reduction in @xmath6 for a small doping change should give important insights into the thermoelectric problem .",
    "early studies on the ( pbte)@xmath0(pbs)@xmath1  system showed that phase separation occurs at low temperature over almost the whole composition range.@xcite a miscibility gap exists over a wide range of composition and extends almost up to the melting point of the alloy .",
    "there are no apparent intermediate compounds and the phase separation occurs into phases which are almost pure pbte and pbs over the whole alloy range .",
    "theoretical work@xcite supports such a picture and the calculated phase diagram using a thermodynamic model agreed with the previous experimental data .",
    "earlier work@xcite suggested a smaller range for the miscibility gap in the phase diagram and this discrepancy was attributed to the subtle difference in chemical processing@xcite and quenching rate .",
    "it is apparent from the high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) images is that phase separation occurs on several different length - scales in pbte@xmath10s@xmath11  and that naturally forming striped nanostructures due to spinodal decomposition are evident in portions of the sample .",
    "here we investigate this question further using bulk diffraction probes of the average and local atomic structure .",
    "we address two questions .",
    "first , can we confirm that the nano - scale phase separation is a bulk property and can we characterize the average chemical composition and structure of the spinodal domain ?",
    "we have also extended the study to other compositions in the phase diagram to see how these effects evolve with changing composition .",
    "the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis of x - ray diffraction data is a useful method for studying nano - phase separated samples.@xcite in the pdf approach both bragg and diffuse scattering are analyzed and it yields the bulk average local atomic structure .",
    "recently it was successfully used to study the thermoelectric material , ag@xmath1pb@xmath12sbte@xmath13 , where silver and antimony rich nano - scale clusters were found to be coherently embedded in the pbte matrix as a bulk property.@xcite    we have used both pdf and rietveld methods to study the ( pbte)@xmath0(pbs)@xmath1system .",
    "we find phase separation occurring over the whole composition range .",
    "refinements from both rietveld and pdf methods show that the @xmath14 , 0.5 , and 0.75 samples are macroscopically separated into phases that are almost pure pbs and pbte .",
    "this does not happen in the important 16% pbs doped sample .",
    "however , taking all the evidence together we suggest that the 16% sample is a nanoscale mixture of a pbte rich phase with a partially spinodally decomposed phase of nominally 50% composition .",
    "such a phase was stabilized and observed in a quenched @xmath3 sample in this study .",
    "this offers the opportunity in the future for engineering nano- and micro - structures with favorable thermoelectric properties by controlling the thermal history in these materials .",
    "powder samples in the ( pbte)@xmath0(pbs)@xmath1  series were made with different compositions : @xmath15 , 0.16 , 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 and 1 .",
    "the samples were produced by mixing appropriate ratios of high purity elemental starting materials with a small molar percentage of pbi@xmath16 , an @xmath17-type dopant .",
    "the initial loads were sealed in fused silica tubes under vacuum and fired at 1273  k for 6  h , followed by rapid cooling to 773  k and held there over a period of 72  h. one @xmath3 sample was also quenched rapidly to room - temperature . more details of sample synthesis can be found elsewhere.@xcite    finely powdered samples were packed in flat plates with a thickness of 1.0  mm sealed between kapton tape windows .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction data were collected using the rapid acquisition pdf ( ra - pdf ) method,@xcite which benefits from very high energy x - rays and a two - dimensional detector .",
    "the experiments were conducted using synchrotron x - rays with an energy of 86.727  kev ( @xmath18   ) at the 6-id - d beam line at the advanced photon source ( aps ) at argonne national laboratory .",
    "the data were collected using a circular image plate camera ( mar345 ) 345  mm in diameter .",
    "the camera was mounted orthogonally to the beam path with a sample - to - detector distance of 210.41  mm .    in order to avoid saturation of the detector ,",

    "one of the main outcomes of this study is to determine the phase composition of the phase - separated sample as a function of composition . when phase separation is long - ranged , rietveld refinement can be used to estimate the relative abundance of the phase components@xcite .",
    "phase segregation can also be determined from the pdf.@xcite in pdffit2 , each phase in a multi - phase fit has its own scale - factor in the refinement .",
    "the scale factor reflects both the relative phase - fraction of the phases and the average scattering power of each phase , which depends on the chemical compositions of each phase .",
    "the conversion from scale - factor to atomic - fraction is done using the equations derived in ref .  .",
    "for each sample , we explored different models .",
    "the structure is of the rock - salt type , space group fm-3 m .",
    "first we start from a homogeneous ( solid solution ) model where the anions are assumed to randomly distributed on the sites of the anionic sublattice . in this model ,",
    "s atoms substitute the te site randomly without breaking the symmetry .",
    "the only structural parameters refined are the lattice constants and the atomic displacement factors .",
    "the next model we tried was a simple two - phase model in which a phase separation into a pbte - rich and pbs - rich phase was assumed .",
    "the phase diagram for this system shows a miscibility gap at low temperature over a wide composition range.@xcite the two phases that coexist have compositions rather close to the pure end - members and there is limited solid solubility .",
    "based on this , and in an effort to keep the modeling as simple as possible , we modeled the phase separation as a mixture of pure pbte and pbs ; however , allowing the lattice constants to vary as would be expected if the phases were not the pure end - members .",
    "the parameters that were allowed to vary in these fits were lattice constants , atomic displacement factors and phase specific scale factors which reflect the relative abundance of each phase .",
    "more complicated phase separated models were also tried where the composition of the phases was varied as described below .",
    "first we carried out pdf and rietveld refinements on the undoped end - members of the series , pbs and pbte .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab;compare - threemodels ]    as expected from the qualitative analysis of the data discussed above , the single - phase solid - solution model ( model a ) provides acceptable fits to the data .",
    "the refined lattice parameters are shorter than pure pbte . according to the vegard s law analysis",
    ", the refined lattice parameter gives a nominal composition for this sample of 0.14 ( rietveld)/0.12(pdf ) , in reasonable agreement with the actual composition .",
    "enlarged adps are found on the pb sublattice with smaller adps on the te lattice , as was the case for the pbte end - member . as expected for a solid - solution ,",
    "the adps are enlarged with respect to pbte .    for completeness",
    ", we also tried the simple model of phase separation into pure pbte and pbs end - members .",
    "the results appear in table  [ tab;compare - threemodels ] as model b. the rietveld fit is significantly worse as measured by @xmath34 . in the case of the pdf",
    "fit the @xmath34 is comparable but the refinement reduced the phase fraction of the second phase and adjusted the lattice parameter of the majority phase , moving the refinement back towards the solid - solution result .",
    "this refinement also returned unphysical negative atomic displacement factors on the minority phase .",
    "the solid - solution model is clearly preferred over full phase separation from the bulk diffraction measurements .    the tem images from the 16% sample ( ref .   and",
    "[ fig;hrtem](a ) ) suggest that it is two - phased , with one phase being homogeneous and the other resembling the quenched @xmath3 sample with arrested spinodal decomposition . a model that simulated this situation was successful compared to the pdf data , as shown from model c in table  [ tab;compare - threemodels ] .",
    "this model assumed that the nominally 16% sample is phase separated into regions that are pure pbte and regions that resemble the quenched 50% sample , i.e. , they are nominally @xmath3 solid - solutions but also exhibiting spinodal decomposition as suggested by the tem images . thus , model c is a phase separation into pure pbte and a solid solution of composition pbte@xmath19s@xmath19 .",
    "this model gives the lowest @xmath34 s for fits to the 16% compound in both the rietveld and pdf refinements .",
    "the phase fractions were free to vary but refined to values that are close to those expected .",
    "the lattice constants refined to reasonable values .",
    "the majority phase lattice constant was close to that of the pbte rich phase in the two - phase refinements in table  [ tab;pdf - rietveld - nominal ] . in the case of the minority phase , the lattice constant lay between pure pbte and pbs consistent with a nominal 50% composition .",
    "the adps are slightly large in the pbte - rich phase but physically reasonable . in the minority phase the adps are unphysical in the rietveld refinement suggesting that this parameter is not well determined in the refinement .",
    "however , in the pdf refinement they are more reasonable , but very large .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the fact that this minority phase itself actually has a compositional variation due to the spinodal effects .",
    "this work confirmed the phase separation tendency of the pbte / pbs system .",
    "it also showed that phase separation can be effectively , but not completely , suppressed by quenching at 50% composition , where a partial spinodal decomposition appears to be taking place , at least in a portion of the sample .",
    "however , the main result is an improvement in our understanding of the state of the thermoelectrically promising 16% sample .",
    "measurements of the bulk average structure , and the bulk local structure , indicate that it is not phase separated into pbte - rich and pbs - poor end - members like the other similarly processed samples in the series .",
    "the best explanation of all the data at hand is that this sample prefers a phase separation into a pbte - rich phase and a phase that is nominally 50% doped , but which has a partial spinodal decomposition reminiscent of the quenched 50% sample .",
    "such a nano - scale phase separation is thought to be important in producing the very low lattice thermal conductivity @xmath6 that is observed in this material@xcite .",
    "interestingly , in this case the effect appeared not after a quench , but after an anneal , suggesting that it is the thermodynamically preferred state , though this needs to be investigated further .",
    "also of interest is to explore further the nature of the pbte - rich component , which preliminary tem investigations@xcite indicate also contains nanostructured regions with nano - scale nuclei of a second phase present .",
    "the other important observation from this work is that quenching is very important in determining the phase separation and resulting nano - scale microstructure .",
    "this suggests that in this system it may be possible to engineer @xmath6 , and therefore @xmath5 in the bulk material by appropriate heat treatments .",
    "this is a promising route for future research ."
