    "wave interference patterns indicate the current density reflected off the junction , which then exits out the contacts on the left side of the device .",
    "the transmitted current predominately focuses into a caustic which enters contact four .    at low magnetic fields , a significant portion of the current injected from contact one hits the top edge of the device before crossing the junction , as seen for _ p - n _ junction in fig .",

    "this is a consequence of the device geometry studied by chen _",

    "there is a significant portion of current which is incoming normal to the junction and transmits to the other side , focusing on contact 4 .",
    "due to the filtering effect of a smooth _ p - n _ junction , the second tmf resonance is significantly weaker .    to further understand the local particle current density of the devices in fig .",

    "[ fig : mode_by_mode ] we resolve the characteristic by each propagating mode . by resolving each mode which contributes to the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] , we observe a combination of features reminiscent of semi - classical skipping orbits and quantum mechanical interference patterns .",
    "the lowest mode is injected straight into the device , perpendicular to the semi - infinite contact . in the first resonance of the _ p - p _ and _ p - n _ junction , shown in columns one and three of fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_by_mode ] , respectively , the lowest mode is bent so that the wave is propagating approximately normal to the junction when it crosses it .",
    "thus , the lowest mode is nearly perfectly transmitted , with very few reflections ( indicated by interference fringes ) visible .",
    "higher modes are injected into the device with non - zero angles and arrive at the junction traveling at oblique angles .",
    "for the first resonance of the _ p - p _ , the beam is noticeably refracted as it crosses the junction . in the _ p - n _ junction ,",
    "the higher order modes have significant components which are reflected off the junction , due to the angle dependent transmission across the junction .    for the second resonance of the _ p - p _ and _ p - n _ configurations , the local particle current density patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] are more complex than the first resonance . by resolving each mode , we are able to develop a better picture of the important transport mechanisms",
    ". the higher order modes for the _ p - p _ junction have a component which transports nearly parallel to the lower edge of the device .",
    "this is particularly evident in the fourth and fifth modes .",
    "most of the carriers which transport in this manner will miss contact two and transmit out contact three , resulting in a weaker signal for the second focusing resonance .",
    "the second focusing resonance of the _ p - n _ displays the most complex characteristics of the device , with predominant quantum characteristics not present in the other configurations . at the higher magnetic field ,",
    "the first and second modes appear to begin to form landau levels when they collide with the junction , similar to what we have studied in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the higher order modes , however , instead show a more complex , swirling pattern .",
    "the carriers transport in skipping orbits which partially reflect of the junction , interfering with themselves .",
    "a portion of each orbit transmits across the junction , contributing to the second _ p - n _ resonance .    as mentioned previously , the dephasing edge contacts ( labeled contact zero and three ) are critical to attaining the results presented in this paper . to demonstrate this importance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephase_comparison ] we plot the local particle current density for the device configured as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd]b both with and without the dephasing contacts . when the dephasing contacts are removed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephase_comparison]b , the portions of the wave which normally exit contacts zero and three , instead scatters around the edge of the device .",
    "the wave will continue to scatter around the device , interfering with itself , until exiting out one of the small contacts .",
    "this process occurs until the device reaches steady state , resulting in the extremely chaotic pattern shown and the destruction of any resonance characteristics .",
    "[ fig : linescan ] shows the non - local resistance ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) and selected transmission coefficients ( [ eq : transmission ] ) as a function of applied magnetic field for an asymmetric _ p - p _ junction and a symmetric _ p - n _ junction .",
    "the two junction configurations are doped the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd]a and b , respectively .    it is non - trivial to extract specific terms from ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) , in terms of transmission functions , which result in the final form of the non - local resistance .",
    "the final magnitude and shape of the curve consists of permutations of transmission functions between every contact combined together .",
    "however , we are able to target specific transmission functions which are important in understanding the problem .    in the unipolar _ p - p _ configuration , we observe three well defined tmf resonances .",
    "we are able to match the first two tmf resonances to a peak in the transmission from contact one into two , @xmath61 . when the junction is switched to the _ p - n _ configuration , when in resonance , carriers are now focused from contact one into contact four .",
    "this results in a negative peak in resistance at @xmath62 t , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : linescan]b . the important transmission function for understanding the resonance condition of the _",
    "p - n _ junction is @xmath63 , which is peaked while the device is in resonance .    each subsequent tmf resonance of the unipolar junction configuration decreases in magnitude . for higher order tmf resonances ,",
    "an increase in @xmath64 indicates that the focusing effect is diminished .",
    "this is due to interference caused by the increased number of scattering events off the edges of the device .",
    "when either configuration of junction is not in resonance , there is an increase in the transmission from contact one into contact three , @xmath64 . in the off - resonance state of",
    "the _ p - p _ junction , carriers which are not focused from contact one into two will hit the bottom edge of the device and skip into contact three .",
    "to maintain current conservation , the carriers will be re - injected by the floating contact three and the magnetic field will direct the carriers towards contact four , resulting in the negative off - resonance resistance in fig .",
    "[ fig : linescan]a .",
    "conversely , in the _ p - n _ junction , carriers which miss contact four will skip along the top edge of the device . again",
    ", they will be dephased by contact three , except this time the re - injected carriers will be directed towards contact two , which results in the positive off - resonance resistance in fig .",
    "[ fig : linescan]b . in fig .",
    "[ fig : off_resonance_map ] we illustrate the off - resonance particle current density for a symmetric _ p - n _ junction .    .",
    "our results show exceptional agreement with ( b ) experimental measurements of chen _ et al _ @xcite , reproduced with copyright permission . ]",
    "the junction filtering effect , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] , results in significantly weaker and fewer tmf resonances when the device is in the _ p - n _ configuration . for the symmetric _ p - n _ junction , in fig .",
    "[ fig : linescan ] , only a single well defined resonance is observed . at higher magnetic fields the beam of carriers skips along the edge of the junction ; each time the beam hits the junction only a very small amount will leak through . since , in our model , no dephasing happens along the junction , the reflected wave of carriers will interfere with itself , further disrupting any resonance from setting up .",
    "in addition , the non - local resistance tends towards zero for each configuration at around @xmath65 t. this is due to the carriers being forced into edge states as the device enters the quantum hall regime .",
    "this effect is also the reason why we do not see a well defined peak in @xmath61 for the third tmf resonance of the _ p - p _ junction configuration . capturing this feature highlights the power of quantum transport modeling , where our simulations smoothly transition between carriers occupying semi - classical skipping orbits and edge states .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , we compare our model with the recent experimental data of chen _ et al _ @xcite , reproduced with copyright permission . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map]a , we fix the doping of the left side of the junction to @xmath59 mev ( p - type ) and vary the doping of the right side of the junction and applied magnetic field simultaneously . for each configuration",
    "we calculate the non - local resistance ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) as before .",
    "we report the doping of the right side in terms of carrier density @xmath7 , which has a similar functional form to the gate voltage applied in experiment .",
    "our simulation results show a striking similarity to the experimental data , capturing all of the major features .",
    "these include the four unipolar junction tmf resonances , the first ambipolar tmf resonance , and the negative / positive peaks in resistance when the unipolar / ambipolar configurations are not in resonance , respectively .",
    "we also are able to explain a number of subtle features seen experimentally which are due to the transitions between different types of junctions .",
    "the second negative peak in the unipolar junction configuration begins to disappear as the right side of the device is more strongly doped _",
    "this transition occurs when the doping of the right side of the junction exceeds the doping of the left side .    the second ambipolar junction tmf resonance in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] is extremely weak until the _ n_-type doping of the right side of the junction exceeds the fixed _ p_-type doping .",
    "this effect is enabled by the increased number of modes available to conduct on the right side of the junction as the doping is increased . the filtering effect due to the large junction width present in our model and in experiment",
    "@xcite prohibits the traditional picture of the carrier density snaking across the junction several times in the second tmf resonance . instead , the resonance has the characteristic of the flow map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd]d .    in our simulation a larger magnetic field must be used , since our simulated hall bar is about a factor of ten smaller than the experimental device .",
    "the difference in device size and contact dimensions also accounts for the difference in magnitude of our simulated resistance .",
    "using larger contacts will result in smaller values of resistance .",
    "however , the concepts we have discussed may still be applied to understand the experimental measurements of chen _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we demonstrate a quantum transport model for a tmf experiment on graphene _ p - n _ by chen _ et al _ @xcite . spatially resolved particle current density flow maps reveal the behavior of carriers in the first and second resonances of _ p - p _ and _ p - n _ junctions .",
    "our results demonstrate the importance of wave interference and junction filtering effect for understanding tmf experiments . a combination of dephasing edge contacts and use of the landauer - bttiker formula supplementing the standard tight - binding model yield extremely close agreement with experiment .",
    "our non - local resistance simulations show well defined positive and negative peaks , which are due to enhanced transmission into contacts three or four , respectively . many of the features seen by chen _",
    "et al _ @xcite have been explained , including the transition into the quantum hall regime for high magnetic fields and the transitions between different _ p - p _ and _ p - n _ doping regimes .",
