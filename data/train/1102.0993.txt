    "this paper was motivated by an observation during the research of @xcite , namely that e.h .",
    "spanier , when writing his celebrated book on algebraic topology @xcite , apparently made an oversight in the statement which immediately precedes corollary 2.5.14 .",
    "that statement , in which he characterizes semilocal simple connectivity in terms of vanishing of a certain group @xmath0 for at least one open covering @xmath1 of the space , turns out to be correct only if one additionally assumes local path - connectedness .",
    "of course , one may wonder if this assumption was perhaps not implicitly made .",
    "however , in view of the author s great attention to details in this book in general , our ultimate conclusion was that spanier would have mentioned this additional assumption had he been aware of the phenomena and examples that we shall expose below .",
    "roughly speaking , a problem occurs for spaces which are not locally path - connected .",
    "this is because the fundamental group uses base points , whereas the subgroup of the fundamental group which spanier associated with a covering ( and which we henceforth call the _ spanier group _ ) does not use base points in a similar way . of course",
    ", this group is defined as a subgroup of the fundamental group and therefore it depends on the same base point as the fundamental group , but the concept of spanier groups refrains from using base points for each set of the covering separately .",
    "therefore spanier s characterization of semilocal simple connectivity ( cf",
    ".  immediately before corollary 2.5.14 ) matches his definition ( cf .  immediately before theorem 2.4.10 ) only in the locally path - connected case .",
    "the main purpose of our paper is to :    * confirm this assertion by constructing a space @xmath2 which is semilocally simply connected in the sense of spanier , but its spanier group is non - trivial ( cf .",
    "proposition [ y ] ) ; * confirm the  if \"-",
    "part of the claim preceding corollary 2.5.14 , for all spaces and the  only - if \" part for locally path - connected spaces ( theorem [ properties](3)(4 ) ) ; * propose a modification of spanier groups so that the corresponding claim will be correct for all spaces ( theorem [ properties](2 ) ) and * propose a modification of the definition of semilocal simple connectivity and prove that with this modified definition and with the original definition of spanier groups the claim preceding corollary 2.5.14 is also correct ( theorem [ properties](1 ) ) .    accordingly , there will be two concepts of semilocal simple connectivity and two versions of spanier groups  one which depends on base points and one which does not . in order to avoid ambiguity in the terminology of the present paper",
    ", we will from now on speak of these concepts using the attributes  based \" and `` unbased '' ( cf .",
    "definitions [ basedslsc][unbasedspaniergroup ] and [ basedspaniergroup ] ) .",
    "while semilocal simple connectivity is a crucial condition in classical covering space theory , the generalized covering space theory treated in @xcite mainly considered the weaker condition called  homotopically hausdorff \" .",
    "the paper @xcite also studied two versions of this condition , one which depends on base points and one which does not .",
    "however , in our case we will adopt the notation from @xcite and use the attributes  weak \" and  strong \" ( cf .",
    "definition [ homhaus ] ) , respectively .",
    "when base points are treated correctly , the conditions of semilocal simple connectivity can be equivalently described by properties of spanier groups ( theorem [ properties](1)(2 ) ) .",
    "however , we only know sufficient conditions on spanier groups which imply homotopic hausdorffness ( section 6 , ( 11)(12 ) ) . in this context it should also be pointed out that even the weakest of these conditions for spanier groups implies a condition that we will call  homotopically path - hausdorff \" .",
    "this condition was not mentioned in @xcite or @xcite , but is similar to a condition that appeared under a different name in @xcite , a preprint preceding @xcite .",
    "therefore the concept of based spanier groups , introduced in this paper , also apparently yields the weakest currently known algebraic sufficient condition for the existence of generalized universal covering spaces ( theorem [ covering ] ) .",
    "we also wish to point out that we are not aware of the above described incorrectness in spanier s book leading to a false theorem therein .",
    "all places that we found , where the crucial remark preceding corollary 2.5.14 has been applied , were statements where local path - connectedness of the underlying topological space has been an assumption , and in this framework the crucial statement is correct .",
    "our paper will in section  6 also briefly discuss known implications among all the mathematical concepts mentioned so far .",
    "all topological spaces in this article are assumed to be path - connected .",
    "since we need to consider the fundamental group , it does not seem necessary to consider more general spaces .",

    "instead , the following procedure is apparently in general necessary :    * for each @xmath17 take @xmath31 copies into @xmath30 ; and * define each of those copies as @xmath32 , i.e.  use the same set @xmath29 as first entry , and let the second entry run over all points @xmath33 .",
    "when constructed with this procedure , coverings by neighbourhood pairs offer in principle the same options for refinements as coverings by open sets . vice versa note , that this procedure will usually generate such coverings by pointed sets , where a lot of @xmath34 occur as base points for different sets @xmath29    .",

[ remark ] recall that all topological spaces in this paper are assumed to be path - connected . despite discussing the properties  based \" and  unbased \" , by definition the fundamental group and ( since they are defined as subgroups ) also all spanier groups formally depend on a base point .",
