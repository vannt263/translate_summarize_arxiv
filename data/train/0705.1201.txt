    "a new superfluid ground state originally named interior gap or breached pairing ( bp ) superfluidity has been recently investigated @xcite .",
    "this state presents a homogeneous mixture of normal and superfluid properties and should occur in fermionic systems with different fermi surfaces .",
    "superfluidity develops at the fermi surface of the quasi - particles with the smallest fermi momentum . since its proposal",
    "much work has been done in understanding the nature of this state and in particular its stability @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the possibility of interior gap superfluidity in systems where the quasi - particles can transmute into one another and only their total number is conserved .",
    "our results are directly relevant for condensed matter systems , cold - atom systems @xcite in the presence of rabi coupling @xcite and should be of interest for the study of color superconductivity on the core of neutron stars with quarks that can interchange their flavors @xcite . for concreteness",
    "we focus in the former problem .",
    "specifically , on superconductivity in transition metals ( tm ) or rare earth inter - metallic systems where a large @xmath0-band of conduction electrons ( @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ) coexist with a narrow @xmath3-band of @xmath4 or @xmath5-electrons .",
    "we consider inter and intra - band attractive interactions . in both cases",
    "we show that a finite interaction is necessary to give rise to superconductivity , differently from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite case . for inter - band attraction the transition into the superconducting state",
    "is first order .",
    "we find a new superconducting state with features of the internal gap or breached pairing state @xcite including _ fermi surfaces _ with gapless excitations . in the intra - band case",
    "there is a superconducting quantum critical point ( qcp ) that can be probed in experiments under pressure .",
    "finally , we include both inter and intra - band interactions and show that in this case gapless excitations are generally suppressed .",
    "we consider initially a model with two types of quasi - particles , @xmath0 and @xmath3 , with an attractive interaction @xcite @xmath6 and a hybridization term @xmath7 that mixes different quasi - particles states .",
    "this one - body mixing term @xmath7 arises from overlap of different orbitals either in the same , or different sites .",
    "it is a useful control parameter since it can be varied by external pressure allowing to explore the phase diagram and quantum phase transitions of the model .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are creation operators for the light @xmath0 and the heavy @xmath3-quasi - particles , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath11 .",
    "the dispersion relations @xmath12 and the ratio between effective masses is taken as @xmath13 . when @xmath14 this model requires a critical value @xmath15 of the order parameter , @xmath16 , to sustain bcs superconductivity @xcite ( we neglect spin indexes here ) .",
    "the instability of the bcs phase for @xmath17 is associated with a soft mode at a wave - vector @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) which suggests a transition to a fulde and ferrel , larkin , ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite with a characteristic wave - vector @xmath20 .",
    "however the window of parameters for which this phase is stable is very narrow @xcite and a bp or sarma phase @xcite has also been considered . since",
    "this corresponds to a maximum of the free energy , a mixed phase with normal and superconducting regions @xcite was proposed as an alternative ground state for @xmath17 .    in order to obtain the spectrum of excitations of eq.[lw ] within the bcs ( mean - field ) approximation",
    ", we use the equation of motion method to calculate standard and anomalous greens functions .",
    "excitonic type of correlations that just renormalize the hybridization @xcite have been neglected .",
    "the order parameter @xmath21 is obtained self - consistently from the anomalous greens function , @xmath22 } { ( \\omega ^{2}-\\omega _ { 1}^{2})(\\omega ^{2}-\\omega _ { 2}^{2})}.   \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] besides , hybridization combined with the interaction @xmath6 can give rise to a net attraction between the @xmath3 quasi - particles , even in the absence of such interaction in the original hamiltonian .",
    "this becomes manifest in the calculations where we find a finite anomalous greens function @xmath23 given by , @xmath24 it turns out however that the anomalous correlation function @xmath25 is identically zero in the present calculation .",
    "the poles of the greens function occur for @xmath26 , where , @xmath27with , @xmath28and @xmath29 in the calculations below we take @xmath30 since the relevant parameter is the mass ratio @xmath31 .",
    "energies are normalized by the fermi energy @xmath32 of the light quasi - particles , such that , in all figures the quantities in the axis are numbers .",
    "the original band dispersion relations are then written as , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . assuming all states with negative energy",
    "are filled , we have @xmath35 .",
    "we take @xmath36 , @xmath37 , such that , @xmath38 as in ref .",
    "caldas for cold atomic systems @xcite .",
    "these numbers are also appropriate to describe transition metals ( tm ) for which typical values of the bandwidths ( @xmath39 ) are a few electronvolts with @xmath6 and @xmath7 both of order @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath31 ranges from @xmath40 for tm to @xmath42 for heavy fermions ( hf ) @xcite .",
    "the general features of the solutions we obtain are however independent of a particular set of parameters .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the dispersion relations of the excitations . differently from the case",
    "@xmath14 , there are no negative values of the energy @xcite for any @xmath43 .",
    "however , the dispersion relations vanish at two , two - dimensional _ fermi surfaces_@xcite determined by , @xmath44for @xmath45 where , @xmath46 with @xcite @xmath47 . as @xmath21 , i.e. , the coupling g increases and reaches @xmath48 , the two gapless fermi surfaces ( fs ) merge at a critical fs .",
    "for @xmath49 the dispersion relations are bcs - like with a finite gap for excitations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the instability of the bcs phase can also be triggered by the hybridization which increases the mismatch of the fermi surfaces due to a _ repulsion _ between the bands @xcite .",
    "it occurs at a critical value , @xmath50 for a fixed @xmath51 .",
    "both instabilities , due to increasing hybridization , or by decreasing the coupling @xmath6 ( or @xmath52 ) , belong to the same universality class and are associated with a soft mode at a wave - vector @xmath53 .",
    "dispersion relations with similar features of those shown in fig.[fig1 ] were obtained for color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "an additional p - wave instability at the new fs@xcite , which is outside the scope of the present mean - field approach , has been investigated . in the metallic problem",
    "there is the possibility of additional pairing in the s - wave channel of the same type of particles due to the extra spins degree of freedom ( see eq . [ bb ] ) .",
    "however , as pointed out before , the relevant anomalous correlation function associated with this greens function turns out to be identically zero .",
    "notice that the dispersion of the fermions close to the new fs are linear and at least in d=2 , this requires a finite interaction for pairing to occur @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to consider other types of instability at these fermi surfaces , as spin density wave ordering .    from the discontinuity of the greens functions on the real axis",
    "we can obtain the anomalous correlation function characterizing the superconducting state .",
    "the self - consistent equation for the order parameter @xmath54 at @xmath55 is given by , @xmath56    \\label{op}\\]]where @xmath57 . this equation can be written as , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the density of states at the fermi level of the @xmath0-band . the function @xmath60 is plotted in fig.[fig2 ] for several values of the hybridization parameter . for @xmath14",
    "a solution with a finite order parameter @xmath21 only exists for @xmath61 with @xmath62|\\sim 0.123 $ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is a small cut - off energy around the fermi energy where the integrals in energy are performed .",
    "still for @xmath14 there is another characteristic value of the coupling @xmath64 , such that , for @xmath65 the system presents a bp or a mixed phase @xcite .",
    "for @xmath66 superconductivity is of the bcs type @xcite . since the bp phase appears as a maximum of the free energy , an alternative state for @xmath65 is a mixed phase with coexisting normal and superconducting bcs - like regions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath66 the superconducting bcs is the stable ground state @xcite .",
    "as hybridization is turned on at zero temperature a stronger value of the coupling @xmath6 is necessary to obtain a superconducting solution , since @xmath67 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath68 normalized by its value for @xmath14 is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "although hybridization acts in detriment of superconductivity we notice that , at least for small values of @xmath7 , a weak coupling approximation is still justified , as for @xmath14 treated in ref .",
    "the function @xmath69 is flat up to @xmath70 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , such that , when the coupling @xmath6 is strong enough to stabilize a superconducting solution it occurs already at a finite value of the order parameter .",
    "consequently , for @xmath71 the quantum , normal to superconducting phase transition as a function of the coupling @xmath6 is first order .",
    "for @xmath72 there is a superconducting solution , the gs phase in fig.[fig2 ] , with the spectra of excitations shown in fig.fig1 as full lines .",
    "this solution corresponds to a metastable minimum of the free energy .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig3 ] where we plot the zero temperature free energy for a fixed hybridization , @xmath73 , and different values of the coupling parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the metastable minima appear for @xmath74 and occur at values of the order parameter @xmath75 , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . for these values of @xmath21",
    "the gaps in the lower branch of the dispersion relations vanish at two two - dimensional _ fermi surfaces _ ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this superconducting phase has similarities to the bp superconductor @xcite in that both have gapless excitations , but with the difference that the present one corresponds to a minimum , even though metastable , of the free energy .    at @xmath76 the normal and superconducting phase exchange stability at a quantum first order phase transition .",
    "the critical value @xmath77 for a fixed @xmath7 is given by the condition @xmath78=e[\\delta_{ab}(v ) , g = g_{2,v}^{c}]$ ] where @xmath79 is the zero temperature free energy .",
    "as the coupling @xmath6 increases beyond @xmath80 , the first solution for this equation is obtained for @xmath81 ( see eq .",
    "[ critical ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the first order transition _ as a function of the coupling strength _ occurs together with the change in the excitation spectrum .",
    "for @xmath82 the stable ground state is a bcs type of superconductor with gapped excitations since the stable free energy minimum occurs for values of the order parameter @xmath83 ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the dispersion relations are like those shown as dashed lines in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we point out that for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) the metastable minimum of the free energy disappears ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "then , the value @xmath86 marks the limit of stability of the bcs - like superconducting phase into the normal phase .",
    "the other limit , of the metastable normal phase in the superconducting phase is not shown .",
    "then , as one increases hybridization in a two - band bcs superconductor with attractive inter - band interactions , two main effects take place",
    ". first , hybridization increases the mismatch between the fermi surfaces giving rise to a first order transition from the bcs - superconductor to the normal state . at",
    "this transition appears a metastable gs phase with two two - dimensional fermi surfaces with gapless excitations . differently from the breached pairing state , in this gs phase pairing takes place among quasi - particles with momenta between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the mixing of the quasi - particles allow them to take advantage of the condensation energy in this range of k - space reducing the energy of the gs phase with respect to the bp state .",
    "next we consider a closely related model which is relevant for many physical systems of interest as inter - metallic compounds , high @xmath89 and heavy fermion materials @xcite .",
    "it consists of a narrow band of quasi - particles with an attractive interaction that hybridizes with another band .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath90 in this case we have to keep track of the spin indexes since the operators associated with the particles forming the pairs do not necessarily anticommute .",
    "the dispersion relations of the quasi - particles in the bcs approximation are obtained , as before , from the poles of the greens functions .",
    "they are given by , @xmath91 with , @xmath92 and @xmath93\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is a new order parameter associated with superconductivity in the narrow b - band . for @xmath95 , the dispersion relations above do not vanish for any value of @xmath96 , as can be verified from the condition , @xmath97 which has no real solution .",
    "these new dispersions are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the lower branch of the dispersion has dips for wave - vectors close to the original fermi wave - vectors .",
    "the gaps at the dips vary linearly with the order parameter @xmath98 , for fixed @xmath7 , as shown in the inset .",
    "this suggests that the modes at the dips behave as roton - like excitations with a roton gap proportional to the superconducting order parameter . for fixed @xmath98",
    "changing the hybridization , the gap close to @xmath87 can become arbitrarily small ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . as shown in this figure",
    "this gap may be smaller than the gap at @xmath88 associated with superconductivity .",
    "this has experimental consequences as the activated behavior of thermodynamic properties will be dominated by the smaller gap due to hybridization .",
    "the gap equation at @xmath99 is given by , @xmath100\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the density of states of the narrow b - band at the fermi level .",
    "for @xmath14 this reduces to the bcs gap equation for a single @xmath3-band . in fig.[fig5 ] we show @xmath102 as a function of @xmath98 for several values of the hybridization .",
    "we find that @xmath103 is finite for values of @xmath95 showing that in this case a finite interaction @xmath104 is necessary for the appearance of superconductivity differently from a single bcs - band .",
    "notice that for physical values of the hybridization , @xmath105 the condition for superconductivity @xmath106 is still in the weak coupling regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "then for small but reasonable values of @xmath7 the present bcs approach yields useful results . as in the previous section , we get in this intra - band case a finite greens function @xmath107 , but we find that the anomalous correlation function @xmath108 is identically zero .",
    "the quantum phase transition at @xmath109 is second order , as can be seen from fig.[fig5 ] , since the condition @xmath110 is first satisfied for @xmath111 . besides the free energy curves in the inset of this figure show directly the continuous nature of the transition .",
    "quantum fluctuations as coupling to the electromagnetic field @xcite could eventually drive this transition first order , but this is outside the scope of the present bcs approximation . since in real multi - band systems",
    "some hybridization always occurs the existence of a quantum critical point should be ubiquitous in superconducting compounds with intra - band attractive interactions .",
    "this qcp can be reached applying pressure in the system to vary the overlap of the atomic orbitals and consequently @xmath7 , as is common , for example , in the study of hf materials @xcite .",
    "finally , we address the general case of attraction among the heavy @xmath3-quasi - particles and the @xmath0 and @xmath3 fermions ( inter and intra - band attractive interactions ) .",
    "the calculations are long but can be carried out analytically .",
    "the new excitations are obtained from the equation , @xmath112 \\omega^2 + 4   v \\delta \\delta_{ab }   \\omega + \\nonumber   \\\\ & \\left[\\epsilon_k^a \\epsilon_k^b - ( v^2 - \\delta_{ab}^2)\\right]^2 + \\delta^2 \\epsilon_k^{a2 } = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the frequency of these excitations to vanish it is required that @xmath113 ^ 2 + \\delta^2 \\epsilon_k^{a2 } = 0 $ ] .",
    "this can occur by tuning the hybridization parameter , such that , @xmath114 in which case gapless excitations appear at @xmath115 where @xmath116 . without this fine tuning",
    "there are no gapless modes .",
    "if , for symmetry reasons , we neglect the term linear in @xmath117 , we obtain the energy of the excitations in the form @xmath118 with , @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are given by eqs .",
    "[ ak ] and [ bk ] respectively . in the appropriate limits",
    "these equations reduce to the cases we studied before .",
    "notice that in this case there are two order parameters in the problem , @xmath98 and @xmath52 , both defined before .",
    "the dispersion relations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . excluding the fine tuned case @xmath114 , any attractive interaction among the @xmath3-quasi - particles removes the gapless modes in the dispersion relations independently of @xmath52 or fermi - surface mismatch .",
    "the order parameters are determined by two coupled equations which for finite temperature are given by , @xmath123\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath124\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "[ gg ] and [ gbg ] define the gap functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "adding these equations we get , @xmath128 .",
    "this function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for @xmath129 and",
    "small values of @xmath98 there is a region of first order transitions and this remains valid even as @xmath130 .",
    "the existence of an intra - band interaction and two order parameters makes this case qualitatively different from the pure inter - band interaction even in the limit @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "we have investigated superconductivity in two - band systems with mismatched fermi surfaces in the presence of hybridization using a mean - field approximation . for inter - band interactions we found a phase with gapless excitations on two two - dimensional _",
    "fermi surfaces_. this replaces the bp phase in the case the quasi - particles can transmute into one another .",
    "this phase corresponds to a metastable minimum of the free energy for a constant q - independent interaction .",
    "differently from the bp phase pairing occurs between the fermi surfaces and this results in a net gain of energy due to the condensation of these quasi - particles . in the intra - band case",
    "we have shown the existence of a qcp at which superconductivity is destroyed as hybridization ( pressure ) increases beyond a critical value .",
    "the phase diagram and quantum phase transitions can be explored either by changing the strength of the attractive interactions or the hybridization .",
    "hybridization among other things varies the mismatch of the fermi surfaces . since in real systems",
    "it can be controlled by external pressure it is a useful parameter to investigate the effects of fermi surface mismatch in multi - band superconductors .",
    "our mean - field approach is more appropriate to treat weak coupling systems with @xmath132 , although even in this case it can miss effects due to fluctuations , as an additional p - wave instability @xcite . in the metallic problem ,",
    "the quasi - particles have spins as extra degrees of freedom and in principle there is the possibility of an additional s - wave pairing between quasi - particles at the gapless fermi surfaces .",
    "this is taken into account in the mean - field approach even if the interaction between these quasi - particles is not included in the hamiltonian .",
    "this manifests through the appearance of anomalous greens functions involving these quasi - particles .",
    "however , only in the case @xmath6 and @xmath133 are finite we find two order parameters , with none being identically zero .    in heavy fermion materials @xcite hybridization plays an important role and they could display the effects and phase transitions discussed above .",
    "as hybridization ( pressure ) increases giving rise to fermi surface mismatch , we expect a qcp associated with vanishing superconductivity for predominant intra - band interactions .",
    "if inter - band coupling is stronger an fflo or other exotic superconducting phases are expected with increasing hybridization .",
    "the origin of the attractive interaction , whether due to phonons or spin - fluctuations does not affect the present results , although the use of a mean - field approximation appears questionable to treat these strongly correlated materials .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , for fixed @xmath134 and inter - band interactions , the critical coupling @xmath135 , as the mass ratio @xmath136 . since this holds in the presence of hybridization , hf materials which are characterized by small mass ratios @xmath31 fall in the weak coupling regime for which the present mean - field is appropriate .",
    "multi - band superconductors as @xmath137 are also candidates to investigate the effects discussed here @xcite .",
    "pressure decreases the temperature of the superconducting transition although in actual experiments in these systems it is not enough to drive them to a qcp .",
    "evidence of topological electronic transitions has been found in these experiments .",
    "these transitions involve changes in fermi surfaces and bear some resemblance @xcite with those we studied here .",
    "we hope the results presented in this paper will stimulate further experimental work in multi - band superconductors .",
