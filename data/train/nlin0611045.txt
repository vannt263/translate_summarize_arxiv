    "the difference of two trajectories starting from infinitesimally nearby initial conditions , which is called the lyapunov vector , plays an essential role in the description of stability or instability in dynamical systems .",
    "the exponential rate of expansion or contraction of the absolute value of the lyapunov vector is the lyapunov exponent , and its positivity means that the system has a dynamical instability and is called chaotic .",
    "the lyapunov vector is introduced in each independent direction of phase space , so in general we have to consider a set of lyapunov exponents , called the lyapunov spectrum , and the corresponding lyapunov vectors in a high - dimensional chaotic system .",
    "an algorithm to calculate the lyapunov exponents and vectors in many - body systems has been developed by benettin et al .",
    "@xcite , and shimada and nagashima @xcite , and the behavior of lyapunov vectors has been investigated from various points of view , for example , the conjugate pairing rule for lyapunov spectra in some thermodynamic systems @xcite , and the localization behavior of lyapunov vectors @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , wavelike structure of lyapunov vectors , called lyapunov modes , and the corresponding stepwise structure of lyapunov spectra has drawn attention in many - particle chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "this structure appears in the region of lyapunov exponents with small absolute values .",
    "lyapunov exponents have the dimension of inverse time , so the structure in the small lyapunov exponents is supposed to be a reflection of the slow and macroscopic behavior of many - particle systems . since the first observation of lyapunov modes in computer simulations of hard disk systems @xcite",
    "they have been found in systems with soft potentials , independent of dimensionality and system geometry .",
    "it is now believed that the zero modes arise due to the presence of conserved quantities @xcite , and the spatial dependence of the non - zero modes is essentially analogous to higher order fourier components .",
    "it has been shown that the breaking of conserved quantities , by for example a change from periodic to hard wall boundary conditions , leads to the absence of particular modes .",
    "it is also known that there are stationary modes and time - oscillating modes among the non - zero lyapunov modes , and the time - oscillating period of the lyapunov modes is connected to that of an equilibrium momentum auto - correlation function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of breaking energy conservation by adding energy at one end of the system and removing it at the other .",
    "although this leads to a flow of heat energy through the system , this is not intended to be a realistic model of low dimensional heat flow .",
    "quasi - one - dimensional systems have been extensively used to investigate lyapunov modes and the localization or delocalization of lyapunov vectors for many - particle systems at equilibrium @xcite , and these systems can easily be adapted to maintain a heat flow .",
    "using such a system , we investigate nonequilibrium effects of the lyapunov modes and the momentum auto - correlation functions .",
    "we consider a quasi - one - dimensional many - hard - disk system with a mechanism to insert energy at one end of the system and to remove energy from the other end .",
    "it consists of @xmath0 hard disks of radius @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 in a two - dimensional rectangular region of length @xmath3 and width @xmath4 , with @xmath5 so that the disk order remains invariant .",
    "we choose periodic boundary conditions in the transverse @xmath6-direction , and in the longitudinal @xmath7-direction we use a special boundary condition that allows the transfer of energy between the system and walls : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 is a parameter ( @xmath12 ) . in a collision , @xmath13 is the incoming momentum of the particle and @xmath14 is the outgoing momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 controls the strength of the coupling to the  heat reservoir \" of temperature @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is either @xmath17 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "when @xmath18 the incoming momentum @xmath19 is completely replaced by the mean thermal momentum @xmath20 of the reservoir and all information contained in the incoming momentum is lost . at @xmath21 the connection with the reservoir is removed and the collision process is hard wall . here",
    "we consider values of @xmath11 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 so that the reservoir is coupled to the system but the loss of information is not complete .",
    "we choose the temperatures of the reservoirs independently , so the temperature of the left - hand side reservoir is @xmath24 , and the right - hand side reservoir is @xmath25 . a schematic illustration of this system is given in fig .",
    "[ figb1qua1dim ] . for the numerical results that are shown in this paper",
    ", we use the values @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .     from left to right ) .",
    "when disks collide with walls at either end of the system energy is transferred between the disks and walls depending upon the values of the temperatures @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ]",
    "note that boundary condition ( [ boundcondi2 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath6-direction guarantees that the total momentum in the @xmath6-direction is conserved .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 determines the strength of the coupling between the reservoir and the system , and specifies the fraction of incoming momentum @xmath19 that is retained after the collision . if @xmath33 and @xmath34 then an energy transfer ( heat ) occurs across the system , and a nonequilibrium steady state is established after a long time .",
    "disks with @xmath35 . the reduced lyapunov exponents ( @xmath36 ) with smallest magnitude are shown in the main plot .",
    "the inset is a plot of the positive exponent region of the full lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the circles are the smallest positive exponents , while the crosses are the absolute values of the conjugate negative exponents .",
    "the horizontal axis is the exponent number @xmath37 , numbered from @xmath23 ( the largest ) to @xmath38 ( the smallest ) . ]",
    "figure [ figc1lyapu ] is a graph of the absolute value of the normalized lyapunov spectrum @xmath36 with @xmath39 . here",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent is @xmath40 . from this figure",
    "we see that the positive branch and the negative branch of the lyapunov spectrum are not symmetric , namely @xmath41 particularly for the exponents of smallest magnitude near @xmath42 .",
    "this is different from the equilibrium case ( @xmath43 ) where the dynamics is hamiltonian with the symplectic structure guaranteeing the conjugate pairing rule for the lyapunov spectra @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the system has 3 zero - lyapunov exponents , due to total momentum conservation and spatial translational invariance in the @xmath45direction , and time - translational invariance . in the nonequilibrium case ( @xmath34 )",
    "the total energy of the system is no longer conserved and this is the reason that @xmath46 , although it is zero at equilibrium .",
    ".classification of the exponents in the lyapunov spectrum for the quasi - one - dimensional system of @xmath47 particles .",
    "the four zero exponents are 199 , 200 , 201 and 202 at equilibrium . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ default2 ]    the period @xmath48 ( in numbers of collisions ) of the auto - correlation function ( acf ) @xmath49 for the longitudinal component of the momentum increases , and the amplitude decreases as a function of @xmath11 ( see table [ default2 ] ) .",
    "the time oscillating period @xmath50 of the lyapunov vectors for the @xmath51-th longitudinal ( and the momentum proportional ) mode in the positive branch of the lyapunov spectrum decreases slightly as a function of @xmath11 , whereas in the negative branch the period increases slightly as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "such changes of @xmath52 are especially large for small @xmath51 s , which correspond to the ones close to the zero - lyapunov exponents .",
    "the relation @xmath53 is not correct away from equilibrium , while it is justified in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this does not contradict the proof of this relation as that required equilibrium and is based on the functional form of the lyapunov modes , in particular that they are purely sinusoidal .",
    "the changes in the structure of the lyapunov modes for a system maintained away from equilibrium by a boundary imposed heat flow are described in detail .",
    "the breaking of conservation of energy is shown to introduce systematic effects , changing the number of zero exponents , and modifying the form of other modes , with the basic structure of transverse , longitudinal and momentum proportional modes remaining .",
    "this work is largely descriptive and the theoretical origin of the changes in modes is yet to be developed , as it is for the equilibrium case .",
    "however , it is clear that the modes are not only equilibrium properties of many - particle systems , but also fundamental for nonequilibrium steady states .    the original purpose in introducing the nonequilibrium boundary conditions [ i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ boundcondi1 ] ) and ( [ boundcondi2 ] ) ] was to keep dynamical properties , like the momentum conservation in the transverse direction and deterministic property of orbit , etc .",
    ", in a nonequilibrium dynamics while breaking energy conservation .",
    "the equilibrium case is recovered in the limit as @xmath54 .",
    "therefore this choice of the boundary conditions was not intended to provide a realistic model for the interaction between a heat reservoir and a particle system .",
    "for example , a consequence of these boundary conditions is that the momentum distribution function for a particle in contact with the reservoir is very different from a gaussian .",
    "indeed , we found that the incoming momentum is close to gaussian but the outgoing momentum is strongly peaked around the mean momentum of the reservoir , with the width of its distribution determined by the degree of mixing with the incoming momentum ( that is , determined by the value of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the authors appreciate a careful reading of the manuscript by e. g. d. cohen , and the financial support of the japan society for the promotion of science .",
