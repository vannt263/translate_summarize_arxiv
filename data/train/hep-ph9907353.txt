    "our main source of information about two photon interactions is the classic weizscker - williams process @xmath0 , where for exclusive channels @xmath1 is typically two to six mesons or a baryon - antibaryon final state .",
    "the bulk of the data is obtained without tagging .",
    "then , thanks to the behaviour of the photon propagator , the photons are almost on - shell . by factoring off the known @xmath2 vertices , we learn about real @xmath3 reactions",
    " see for example [ 1 ] . with tagging one can , of course , also investigate important @xmath4 collisions .",
    "i will not review these , but rather refer to the later talk of bernard pire  [ 2 ] .",
    "we can also study the time reversed process , as in e835 at fermilab , by looking at @xmath5  [ 3 ] .       now consider the @xmath6 cross - section as a function of the @xmath3 c.m .",
    "energy @xmath7 .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "there one sees the cross - section rise from threshold , then have structure and subsequently decline .",
    "this cross - section naturally divides into three kinematic regions which correspond to three different dynamical regimes . in each case",
    "the photon couples to the electric charge of a point - like object , but what it sees as point - like changes with energy . at low energy , close to threshold",
    ", the photon has long wavelength and sees the whole of the final state hadron and couples to its electric charge .",
    "this teaches us about _",
    "hadron dynamics_. as the energy increases and the wavelength of the photon shortens , it sees the charged components of the hadron , the constituent quarks . coupling to them",
    ", it causes them to resonate , so we can learn about _ resonance dynamics_.",
    "lastly , as the energy rises still further , the photon sees charged point - like objects inside the constituent quarks , the current quarks , and we can learn about _",
    "quark dynamics_. the extent of the three kinematic regions depends on the final state . for pions ,",
    "the three regions are well - separated , for kaons the near threshold region is foreshortened and the resonance regime more structured . in all three cases , the dynamics",
    "is governed by qcd .",
    "region 3 is the perturbative  non - perturbative interface , while the lower two depend wholly on the strong physics aspects of qcd . for charmonium and charmed particle production ,",
    "regions 2 and 3 merge with each other , both being amenable to perturbative treatment .",
    "let us discuss region 3 , the higher energy regime first , as that is the easier to explain .",
    "above a few gev , when two photons collide in the centre - of - mass frame , they deposit all of their energy in a region the size of a fraction of a fermi .",
    "this creates a @xmath8 pair moving back - to - back .",
    "these radiate soft gluons , until they reach separations of the order of a fermi , when the quarks and gluons fragment .",
    "this produces two back - to - back jets of hadrons that dominate the inclusive high energy cross - section . to produce an exclusive final state like two mesons , the initial @xmath8 pair must radiate at least one hard gluon , which in turn creates another @xmath8 pair , moving back - to - back parallel to the initial quarks , so that these can get together to form a meson",
    "it was brodsky and lepage  [ 7 ] , who long ago , recognised that such processes can be divided into a short - distance part governing the emission of the hard gluon and a long distance component determined by the wavefunction of the hadron final state .",
    "thus they predicted that the differential cross - section for @xmath9 should be given by @xmath10 where the wavefunction of the pion is related to the pion s electromagnetic formfactor @xmath11 .",
    "this prediction ( fig .",
    "2 ) is in reasonable agreement with data from mark ii  [ 1,8 ] , tpc / two - gamma  [ 1,9 ] , cleo  [ 6 ] , et al . to form baryons in the final state",
    ", a further hard gluon has to be radiated , to produce yet another back - to - back @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it was farrar , maina and neri  [ 11 ] , who first extended this discussion to @xmath14 production , by building in the proton s three quark wavefunction of chernyak and zhitnitsky  [ 12 ] .",
    "as seen in fig .  2 , this makes a prediction well below the data .",
    "though baryons are built of three valence quarks , they spend part of their time in a quark - diquark configuration .",
    "perhaps baryons are produced by hard gluons creating just one diquark - antidiquark , instead of two @xmath8 pairs .",
    "this gives the predictions  [ 13 ] shown in fig .  2 , for both the energy and scattering angle dependence , in far better agreement with data .",
    "unfortunately , this detailed modelling is at variance with more recent cleo data on @xmath15 production  [ 14 ] .",
    "if we now look at the energy region of @xmath16 gev , we see distinct resonance structures , for instance in @xmath17  [ 15 ] in fig .",
    "three well - known spin two resonances , the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 appear .",
    "tensor mesons always appear strongly in vector - vector interactions . in the @xmath21 channel ,",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 overlap , so the data display an interference effect .",
    "we know these mesons belong to an almost ideally mixed quark model multiplet , but nevertheless we can use the two photon data to test this . the photons couple to the electric charges of the quarks .",
    "thus the two photon amplitude , fig .",
    "4 , measures their mean charge squared and the cross - section ( and radiative width ) gives the square of this .",
    "thus @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the probability that the quarks annihilate .",
    "it is natural to assume for such a multiplet that the @xmath23 are the same for each member",
    ". then the quark model simply predicts @xmath24 which is sensitive to small deviations from ideal mixing .",
    "experiment confirms the closeness to this pattern with @xmath25 .",
    "so much for relative rates , but what about absolute predictions for the radiative widths .",
    "for these one needs a modelling of the dynamics .",
    "the simplest to imagine is by analogy with positronium decay .",
    "we begin with a fermion - antifermion bound state with definite quantum numbers @xmath26 .",
    "this decays by one fermion exchange , as shown in fig .",
    "this is readily calculated as shown by godfrey and isgur  [ 16 ] , ackleh and barnes  [ 17 ] , klempt et al .  [",
    "18 ] , resag and mnz  [ 19 ] , schuler et al .",
    "[ 20 ] , and many others .",
    "the result simplifies for heavy fermion systems , where one can safely take the non - relativistic limit .",
    "then the bound states formed by the interquark potential have radial wavefunctions @xmath27 that can be straightforwardly calculated using the schrdinger equation .",
    "this gives , for instance , for spin singlet states        this involves the @xmath29th derivative of the wavefunction at the origin , which is computable for charmonium , assuming the form of the interquark potential , coulombic plus linear confinement , for example .",
    "note that the mass of the fermion enters , but not the mass of the bound state . while for heavy flavour systems it may seem eminently sensible to assume the _ effective _ mass of the quark is half that of the bound state , for light quark mesons , this is not so obvious . the relativistic analogue of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is given in [ 17 ] for instance . from this one",
    "would expect the radiative width of the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 to be roughly the same , taking into account merely differences in their @xmath33 , since they are made of quarks with constituent masses of 330450 mev ( depending on their strange quark component ) .",
    "in contrast , experiment gives @xmath34 the recipe for rescuing this potential disaster was suggested long ago by hayne and isgur  [ 21 ] .",
    "they proposed multiplying by a factor of the mass of the meson cubed .",
    "this has been justified by ackleh and barnes  [ 17 ] by noting that if one considers the point interaction of a pseudoscalar with two photons , then the gauge invariant form of the interaction lagrangian is @xmath35 this gives @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a pseudoscalar meson and @xmath38 its mass .",
    "if we take it that what we have calculated by considering the fermion exchange graphs of fig .  4a is some effective coupling @xmath39 , then this has to be corrected by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is typically 1 gev for light hadrons  [ 21,16,17 ] .",
    "whilst such factors bring agreement with experiment for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 , they also affect predictions for the @xmath42 , @xmath43 too , because these mass terms appear cubed . in tables",
    "1,2 we show the predictions for radiative widths for different modellings for a handful of charmonium and light quark states .",
    "we will hear at this meeting , new results to compare with these .",
    "the absolute rates for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 look good .",
    "of course , the quark model not only predicts ground states , but radial excitations too . whilst some , like the @xmath44 , have been seen in hadronic reactions for almost twenty years",
    ", it is only very recently that a candidate , the @xmath45 , has been observed in two photon channels by l3  [ 22 ] at lep . for light quark systems , in particular ,",
    "what is needed are calculations beyond the free quark exchange model .",
    "quarks are confined .",
    "there are no poles in their propagators and the bound state dynamics more complicated ( fig .",
    "meaningful non - perturbative computations should be possible soon .",
    ".radiative widths of some charmonium states predicted by variations on the modelling  [ 16,17,19 ] described in the text compared with the pdg98 average  [ 23 ]  in the case of the @xmath46 this is just one experiment . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < \" , ]      what about the higher mass scalars ? in @xmath47 elastic scattering , the @xmath48 and @xmath49 appear as dips in the cross - section .",
    "it is quite possible that these feed through into the two photon reaction too ( through eq .",
    "if this is the case , then the idea of deducing an upper bound on the radiative width of the @xmath49 by the surplus of events over a smooth background used by aleph  [ 43 ] to obtain @xmath50 kev looks highly questionable . only by extending the amplitude analysis",
    "i have just described to higher @xmath47 masses can one be certain of separating an @xmath51wave signal out from under the larger @xmath52wave components and so deduce meaningful results for the radiative widths of the glueball candidates @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",
    "clearly a pure glueball would have a very tiny @xmath3 width ( coming wholly from higher order graphs in perturbative qcd ) .",
    "consequently , its _ stickiness _ ( defined earlier in this section ) would be large .",
    "large _ means has always been problematic .",
    "stickiness  [ 32 ] is conventionally normalized so that it is 1 for the @xmath54 , a typical quark model state .",
    "however , for its @xmath55 partner , the @xmath56 , the stickiness is @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath20 is not _",
    "sticky _ in the sense of gluey .",
    "this large value happens because its two photon width is small : a result of it being made of charge 1/3 quarks , while the @xmath18 has both @xmath58 and @xmath59 quarks .",
    "the cleo group  [ 44 ] have sought to address this problem .",
    "they define a quantity _ gluiness _ , which is roughly equal for the @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , gluiness  [ 44 ] suffers from the drawback that one has to assume in advance what the charged components of the meson are  something , of course , we want to use the two photon width to determine .    as already remarked the scalar glueball candidates , primarily the @xmath49 and @xmath53 ,",
    "are unlikely to be pure glue , but inevitably mix with the nearby @xmath8 multiplet(s ) .",
    "as soon as this happens , these states cease to have tiny radiative widths , but have those typical of @xmath8 scalars , cf .",
    "table  4 .",
    "stickiness then has much less relevance .",
    "the branching ratio to glue of akir and farrar  [ 36 ] is far more useful , as is the absolute value of their two photon widths .",
    "the predictions for the latter depend very strongly on the assumed mixing scenario as illustrated by comparing the results of close , farrar and li  [ 45 ] with those of jaminon and van den bosche  [ 46 ] and with burakovsky and page  [ 47 ] .",
    "these vary by large factors .",
    "the challenge for the near future is for experiment to deliver accurate measurements , from which the two photon widths of the @xmath49 and @xmath53 can be deduced , and for theory to make reliable predictions for these same states . combining this information we can determine the composition of these key hadrons .",
    "only then will we understand the nature of the light scalar mesons , a nature and composition that is intimately tied to the structure of the qcd vacuum  both @xmath8 and glue .",
    "after decades of promise and years of effort , there may be light at the end of the tunnel ."
