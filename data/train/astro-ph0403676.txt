    "the @xmath1 energetic gamma  ray experiment telescope ( egret ) catalogue of high  energy ( e@xmath4100 mev ) @xmath0ray sources ( hartman et al . 1999 ) refers to the observations carried out by the egret experiment onboard the compton gamma  ray observatory ( cgro ) between april 1991 and october 1995 .",
    "it contains 271 point sources , including : 1 solar flare , the large magellanic cloud , 5 pulsars , the radio galaxy centaurus a , and 66 high  confidence identifications of blazars .",
    "in addition , 27 lower  confidence blazar identifications are included in the catalog , which leaves 170 sources unidentified . since the publication of the catalog",
    ", a lot of effort has been dedicated to the identification of the 170 unidentified egret sources ( grenier 2003 ) . while most of the extragalactic counterparts are blazars , two possible identifications of egret sources with radiogalaxies",
    "have been recently proposed ( combi et al . 2003 , mukherjee et al . 2003 ) , in addition to the well known radiogalaxy cen a. however , the multiwavelength counterpart search is hampered by the limited egret point spread function , which gives error radii of @xmath5 .",
    "one of the two main telescopes on board integral ( winkler et al .",
    "2003 ) is the ibis imager ( ubertini et al .",
    "ibis combines for the first time broad band high energy coverage ( @xmath6  kev ",
    "@xmath7  mev ) with imaging capability .",
    "ibis has a large field of view ( @xmath8 at half response ) , and a fine angular resolution of @xmath9 , sampled in @xmath10 pixels in the low energy ( @xmath11  mev ) layer isgri ( lebrun et al .",

    "isgri reaches a point source location accuracy better than @xmath14 for a @xmath15 detection ( gros et al .",
    "these unprecedented characteristics for a @xmath0ray telescope clearly make ibis one of the best instruments available to date to search for counterparts of unidentified egret sources . within the framework of the core programme ( cp ) observations",
    ", a project has been set up to systematically search for associations between integral sources and egret unidentified error sources .",
    "a first possible identification of an egret source has already been found ( see di cocco et al .",
    "2004 , a&a submitted , for details ) .",
    "every single pointing ( science window , scw ) of the integral core programme observations is progressively analysed , and all the sources detected with signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) greater than @xmath16 are cross  correlated with the @xmath1 egret catalogue to look for possible identifications .",
    "all the integral data analysis described in the present work has been done with the latest version of the offline standard analysis ( osa ) available through the integral science data centre ( isdc ) and whose algorithms are described in goldwurm et al .  ( 2003 ) .    during these scans ,",

    "the source position ( @xmath30% confidence radius = 1.2@xmath31 ) obtained with this longer exposure , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( j2000 ) , is fully compatible with the single scw detection , while the detection significances increased to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in the @xmath23 and @xmath25 kev , respectively .",

    "the results shown in fig .

    "the only other egret source coincident with an ibis source is a known blazar , pks @xmath41 which lies within the error circle of 3eg j@xmath42 .",
    "we presented the first results of the early activity in the search for counterparts of the unidentified egret sources in the framework of the integral core programme .",
    "one candidate counterpart has been found close to the galactic centre and the identification with the active galaxy grs@xmath3 has been proposed .",
    "the cross  correlation of the 2  ms mosaic of the central radiant ( revnivstev et al .",
    "2004 ) with the @xmath1 egret catalog has not produced other possible counterparts .",
