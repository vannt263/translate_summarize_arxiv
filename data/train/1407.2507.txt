    "feynman diagrams are a pictorial way of describing integrals predicting possible outcomes of interactions of subatomic particles in the context of quantum field physics .",
    "if at all possible , evaluating these integrals tends to be challenging and usually produces rather cumbersome expressions .",
    "moreover , many feynman diagrams result in integrals that are divergent in mathematical sense .",
    "physicists have various techniques called `` renormalizations '' of feynman integrals which `` cancel out the infinities '' coming from different parts of the diagrams .",
    "( for a survey of renormalization techniques see , for example , @xcite . ) however , these renormalization techniques appear very suspicious to mathematicians and attract criticism from physicists as well .",
    "for example , if different techniques yield different results , how do you choose the `` right '' technique ? or , if they yield the same result , what is the underlying reason for that ?",
    "if one can find an intrinsic mathematical meaning of feynman diagrams and the corresponding integrals , most of these questions will be resolved .",
    "a number of mathematicians already work on this problem , mostly in the setting of algebraic geometry .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a summary of these algebraic - geometric developments as well as a comprehensive list of references . on the other hand",
    ", igor frenkel has noticed that at least some types of feynman diagrams can be interpreted in the context of representation theory and quaternionic analysis . in @xcite",
    "we successfully identified the three feynman diagrams shown in figure [ basic ] with intertwining operators of certain representations of @xmath0 in the context of quaternionic analysis .",
    "then we raised a natural question of finding mathematical interpretation of other feynman diagrams in the same setting .",
    "0.25     0.25     0.35     this paper deals with conformal four - point integrals described by the box diagrams .",
    "they play an important role in physics , particularly in yang - mills conformal field theory . for more details see @xcite and references therein .",
    "these diagrams have been thoroughly studied by physicists .",
    "for example , the integral described by the one - loop feynman diagram is known to express the hyperbolic volume of an ideal tetrahedron , and is given by the dilogarithm function @xcite ; there are explicit expressions for the integrals described by the ladder diagrams in terms of polylogarithms @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important property of the conformal four - point integrals are the `` magic identities '' due to j.  m.  drummond , j.  henn , v.  a.  smirnov and e.  sokatchev @xcite .",
    "these identities assert that all @xmath1-loop box integrals for four scalar massless particles are equal to each other .",
    "we will discuss these `` magic identities '' in subsection [ magic - id - subsect ] .",
    "the original paper @xcite gives a proof of the magic identities for the euclidean metric case only and claims that the result is also true for the minkowski metric case . in the euclidean case ,",
    "all variables belong to @xmath2 and there are no convergence issues whatsoever . on the other hand ,",
    "the minkowski case ( which is the case we consider ) is much more subtle . in order to deal with convergence issues",
    ", we must consider the so - called `` off - shell minkowski integrals '' or perturb the cycles of integration inside @xmath3 .",
    "then the relative position of the cycles becomes very important .",
    "in fact , choosing the `` wrong '' cycles typically results in integral being zero . in this paper",
    "we specify the `` right '' choice of cycles and find the representation - theoretic meaning of all conformal four - point integrals . to each such",
    "integral , we associate an operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the space of harmonic functions on the algebra of quaternions @xmath2 .",
    "we prove that the operator @xmath4 is @xmath7-equivariant , sends @xmath5 into itself and , in particular , that the result is a function of two variables that is harmonic with respect to each variable , which is not at all obvious from the construction .",
    "we have a decomposition of @xmath7-representations into irreducible components : @xmath8 then , by schur s lemma , @xmath4 acts on each irreducible component @xmath9 by multiplication by some scalar @xmath10 , and we can find these scalars .",
    "this is the essence of the main result ( theorem [ main - thm ] ) . as an immediate corollary",
    ", we obtain the `` magic identities '' for the operators @xmath4 : any two box diagrams with the same number of loops produce the same operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 .",
    "if one can prove that each conformal four - point integral is harmonic with respect to each variable , then one easily obtains the original `` magic identities '' for the conformal four - point integrals .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main - thm ] is essentially by evaluating the operators @xmath4 on a suitably chosen set of generators of @xmath5 .",
    "it is pretty elementary , and we think that it is an advantage of this approach .    for example , the integrals described by the ladder diagrams have been evaluated explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the two most simple conformal four - point integrals are the one- and two - loop ladder integrals @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which can be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the polylogarithm function : @xmath17 the expressions for the other ladder integrals are similar .",
    "by contrast , we have very simple expressions for the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 on @xmath5 .",
    "the operator @xmath18 is just the projection of @xmath5 onto its first irreducible component @xmath20 in the decomposition ( [ decomp - intro ] ) . and",
    "@xmath19 acts on each irreducible component of @xmath5 by multiplication by a scalar , so that if @xmath21 belongs to an irreducible component isomorphic to @xmath22 in the decomposition ( [ decomp - intro ] ) , then @xmath23    thus we have a representation - theoretic interpretation of an infinite family of feynman diagrams , and it is reasonable to expect that an even larger class of feynman diagrams can be interpreted in the same context .",
    "finally , we comment that it is not really necessary to use quaternionic setting to interpret the box diagrams and the corresponding integrals ",
    "one could do the same in the setting of analytic functions of four variables instead .",
    "however , the vacuum polarization diagram does require quaternionic analysis .",
    "also , this article uses results that have already been stated and proved in quaternionic setting . for these reasons we continue to use quaternions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    "we establish our notations and state relevant results from quaternionic analysis . in section [ results - summary ]",
    "we state more recent results from @xcite and @xcite that are used in the proofs . in section [ fd - section ]",
    "we review the box diagrams and the corresponding conformal four - point integrals , state the magic identities and the main result ( theorem [ main - thm ] ) . in section [ proof - section ] we prove theorem [ main - thm ] , first , in the case of ladder diagrams , and then in general .",
    "in this section we establish notations and state relevant results from quaternionic analysis .",
    "we mostly follow our previous papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a contemporary review of quaternionic analysis can be found in @xcite .",

    "we recall some notations from @xcite .",

    "first , we prove the following symmetry property for @xmath297 ( when @xmath299 it is a direct analogue of equation ( 8) in @xcite ) .            similarly to the proof of lemma [ gen - val - lemma ]",
    ", we first integrate over @xmath406 .",
    "it is easy to see that the number of solid edges at @xmath209 is one more than the number of dashed edges .",
    "thus the integral over @xmath209 is very similar to the integral ( [ z_1-integral ] ) with variable @xmath210 replaced with @xmath209 ; this integral is 1 .",
    "hence , for the purposes of evaluating @xmath407 , in diagram @xmath231 we can delete the solid edge joining @xmath209 and @xmath232 and the dashed edge joining @xmath209 and @xmath211 ( see figure [ simplified - fig ] ) .",
    "when we integrate out the @xmath210 variable , by proposition [ quotient - prop ] , we get @xmath409 then we integrate out the @xmath232 variable : @xmath410 using ( [ 1/n - expansion ] ) , we expand @xmath411 and @xmath412 in terms of basis functions ( [ zh - basis ] ) : @xmath413 @xmath414 for some functions @xmath415 . in the diagram @xmath229 , the number of solid edges at @xmath210 is one more than the number of dashed edges .",
    "this implies that only the terms with @xmath416 appear in the expansion of @xmath412 .",
    "thus the integral ( [ t_n - integral ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath417 by corollary [ z^p - cor ] , these terms are zero unless @xmath418 , @xmath419 , @xmath420 and @xmath421 , and ( [ t_n - integral ] ) becomes @xmath422 this proves that @xmath423 where @xmath424 denotes the integral operator corresponding to @xmath229 . by induction hypothesis , corollary [ ladder - recursive - cor ] and lemma [ symmetry - lem ] , this implies ( [ gen - equal - eqn ] ) .    from this point on",
    ", the proof proceeds as in the ladder case , with trivial modifications . because of the way the last slingshot is attached",
    ", we know that the function @xmath208 is harmonic in @xmath210 . then the pairings ( [ h - pairing ] ) and ( [ h - pairing2 ] ) agree , and we can rewrite @xmath4 as @xmath425 where @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , as before .",
    "we introduce a closely related integral operator @xmath426 @xmath427 where @xmath357 , @xmath356 .",
    "the @xmath73-equivariance of this operator follows from the @xmath73-invariance of the bilinear pairings ( [ pairing ] ) , ( [ pairing2 ] ) and lemma [ conformal ] . clearly , we have @xmath428      as we have observed earlier , the number of solid edges at @xmath209 is one more than the number of dashed edges . using this observation , one proceeds exactly as in the proof of lemma [ annihilator - lem1 ] with the roles of the variables @xmath210 and @xmath209 switched .",
    "combining lemmas [ annihilator - lem1-gen ] and [ annihilator - lem2-gen ] , we see that @xmath359 descends to a well - defined @xmath73-equivariant quotient map @xmath435 clearly , this quotient space is a @xmath73-invariant subspace of @xmath436 . by proposition [ quotient - prop ] and lemma [ product - lemma ] , we have the following isomorphisms of representations of @xmath73 : @xmath437 from ( [ ll2-gen ] ) and lemma [ gen - val - lemma ] we conclude that the operator @xmath4 has image in @xmath5 and the map ( [ ln ] ) is @xmath73-equivariant . by ( [ gen - equal - eqn ] ) , the maps @xmath4 and @xmath297 coincide on the generators of @xmath5 . since theorem [ main - thm ] is already established for @xmath297 , it follows that the result holds for @xmath4 as well .",
