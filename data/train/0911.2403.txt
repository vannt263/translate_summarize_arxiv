    "there are many contexts in which rotating flows arise and their instabilities are naturally of interest . for an axisymmetric , incompressible ,",
    "inviscid flow with no variation along the axis of symmetry , rayleigh ( 1916 ) provided a necessary and sufficient condition for stability against axisymmetric perturbations ( chandrasekhar , 1961 ) .",
    "rayleigh also showed that a necessary criterion for the instability of such flows to non - axisymmetric perturbations is an analogue to his classic inflection point criterion for plane flows .",
    "he expressed this criterion in words but the correct mathematical expression is easily worked out following rayleigh s lead ( spiegel and zahn , 1970 ) . for the study of the effect of viscosity on these results , the taylor - couette configuration of flow between coaxial cylinders provides a good proving ground ( chandrasekhar , 1961 ) , although shear and rotation come together in other contexts as well ( yecko and rossi , 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "when criteria for the simplest two - dimensional circular shear flows indicate stability , the question naturally arises whether some simple extraneous effects may be destabilizing . in the case of the linearly stable plane shear flow , magnetic fields ( stern , 1963 and",
    "chen and morrison , 1991 ) , rossby waves ( lovelace _ et al . _ , 1999 ) and suction ( hocking , 1974 ; doering _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) have been found to be destabilizing mechanisms , given suitable conditions . in the case of a stable taylor - couette flow ,",
    "it had been seen even earlier that a magnetic field may be destabilizing ( e.g. chandrasekhar , 1961 ; balbus and hawley , 1998 ) . in an attempt to add to this compendium of instabilities , we here investigate the instability that arises when a formerly circular flow is turned into a spiralling flow by the imposition of continous suction on the inner cylindrical boundary with a compensatory injection of fluid on the outer boundary . for brevity",
    ", we shall hereinafter refer to the induced radial inflow as _ accretion _ and the mechanism driving it as _",
    "suction_.    a practical example of the conversion of differential circular flow to spiraling motion , or _ swirl _",
    ", arises in the study of drag reduction on a cylindrical airfoil ( batchelor , 1967 ) . in that case ,",
    "when suction is imposed on the central cylindrical airfoil , the drag is reduced because boundary layer separation is inhibited .",
    "spiralling flows are also central to the structure and dynamics of accretion disks that form in a great variety of astrophysical situations such as binary stars ( which are often x - ray sources ) , flows around massive black holes at the centers of galaxies , and in the disks around newly born stars where planetary systems are thought to form .    of course , accretion disks are more complicated than the simple model that we consider here . in most astrophysical cases",
    "there is ionization so hydromagnetic effects become important and can produce the magneto - rotational instability ( see balbus and hawley , 1998 ) .",
    "however , protoplanetary nebulae such as the primitive solar nebula are believed to have been cool so that other mechanisms may need to be considered to get the full picture ( for at least some phases ) of the turbulent dynamics of planet formation .",
    "the feature of the present study that may have relevance to the fluid dynamics of astrophysical disks is the radial inflow , or accretion that , in some astrophysical examples , is fed by inflow from an external mass source .",
    "a similar combination of motions occurs also in the terrestrial polar vortex that may play a role in the transport of ozone in the upper atmosphere ( mcintyre , 1995 ) .    with these motivational examples in mind ,",
    "we turn to an idealized pilot problem to learn what may happen when rotation and accretion combine to produce a spiralling motion as in taylor - couette flow with suction .",
    "although we can not draw immediate conclusions about the applications of our results to the motivational examples just described , especially to accretion disks , we regard it as suggestive that the combination of rotation and accretion ( i.e. , radial injection and suction ) in a flow leads to instability .",
    "as we shall see in what follows , taking into account both accretion and rotation leads to very different stability properties of the flow than when only one of these effects alone is included .",
    "for example , in the classical problem of the linear and nonlinear stability of taylor - couette flow between concentric cylinders , the system is linearly stable when the outer cylinder is rotating and the inner one is stationary .",
    "likewise , simple radial accretion without rotation is linearly stable .",
    "however , we find that , at sufficiently large rotational reynolds numbers in a stable tc flow , small accretion rates lead to linear instability",
    ". moreover we find that the rotational motion , rather than simple plane shear , plays a major role in the stability characteristics .",
    "an initially plane - parallel shear layer perturbed by transverse suction may also exhibit a small - suction instability ( hocking , 1974 ) , while larger suction rates absolutely stabilize the corresponding laminar flow for arbitrarily large reynolds numbers ( doering _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "this strong stabilizing effect of suction for even very high reynolds numbers in the plane case does _ not _ carry over to the rotational case ; in the cylindrical geometry transient growth of perturbations is generally encouraged by strong suction .",
    "the following discussion of these issues is organized as follows . in section [ secform ]",
    "we describe taylor - couette flow with suction .",
    "then we treat the linear stability of this flow in section [ seclin ] where we find linear instabilities in the simple flow of the model problem . in section [ secnarrow ] the asymptotic behavior of the onset of linear instability",
    "is computed for different limits in the narrow - gap approximation .",
    "we next go on to consider some nonlinear aspects of the instability .",
    "first , in section [ secenergy ] we describe the energy stability method and then derive some rigorous bounds on the energy stability limit of the flow in section [ secbounds ] .",
    "that limit is computed numerically in section [ secnumc ] .",
    "the concluding section [ conclusion ] summarizes the results and mentions some possible implications . in an appendix",
    "we note that physically relevant bounds on the mean energy dissipation rate for non - steady flows ( including statistically stationary turbulence ) remain unknown in the taylor - couette geometry with suction .",
    "consider the incompressible flow of a newtonian fluid between two coaxial porous cylinders .",

    "to study the destabilizing effect of the inward suction on the stability properties of taylor - couette flow , we perform a linear stability analysis .",
    "it is already known from work by min and lueptow ( 1994 ) that , for axisymmetric disturbances to taylor - couette flow , suction is stabilizing and so increases the critical taylor number at which taylor vortices first appear .",
    "therefore we here consider the linear stability theory for non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we continue to keep the inner cylinder stationary , so that the flow without suction is linearly stable according to rayleigh s criteria for inviscid perturbations .    in most instability mechanisms , only one symmetry of the initial problem",

    "as we mentioned at the outset , there are several interesting problems where differential rotation plays an important role .",
    "we have not hidden our particular interest in the situation of accretion disks where matter rotates differentially around a central gravitating body . these disks are often quite luminous and the source of their emissions has been thought to be in the dissipation of the turbulence that they had long been assumed to sustain .",

    "moreover , turbulence in the disk , if it occurred , was supposed to transport angular momentum out of the disk .",
    "this would allow the purely circular motion to begin to turn inward so that the gas in the disk could fall onto the central object and be accreted .",
    "the resulting spiral motion , or swirl , is then a central feature of the accretion disks yet its dynamical role has been largely glossed over in the discussions of disk instabilities .    for us ,",
    "the intriguing feature of the instability of swirling ( a.k.a . spiraling )",
    "flows in disks is that their instabilities may promote accretion that may in turn enable the inward flow that was the source of instability .",
    "this is positive feedback * par excellence * and we may reasonably anticipate that the instability treated here is likely to cause subcritical bifurcation in disks , though we have not yet shown that .",
    "nevertheless , this physical argument leads us to suppose that rather than thinking of a competition among instability mechanisms , we may imagine a cooperation amongst them .",
    "thus in the linear study of the magneto - rotational instability kersale _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) find that the resulting fluid stresses drive accretion for suitable boundary conditions .",
    "this self - induced accretion means that a swirl is produced that is likely to contribute to the instability we consider here .",
    "this interaction of instabilities in the fully nonlinear regime bids fair to give rise to many of the processes that have been sought to explain the observed wealth of behavior in swirling flows .",
    "however , the work reported here does not treat disks explicitly .",
    "we have chosen instead to consider a fluid flow field that is well known to be stable and to show that by converting it from purely circular to swirling motion by the agency of accretion we could render it linearly unstable .",
    "this required only a simple change in the boundary conditions to vitiate the applicability of rayleigh s inflection point theorem for circular motion .",
    "it remains to learn whether this destabilization will apply to keplerian flows , though the mechanism seems generic and we do think the instability is inherent to physically realistic , spiraling flows . as to real disks , there we are in the domain of shallow gas theory and that will lead to a more difficult investigation , but in the beginning it will be a linear one .",
    "in the meantime , it could well be that other instabilities will be uncovered as other variations on disk flows are examined .",

    "<S> our results , though specialized , may have implications for drag reduction by suction , accretion in astrophysical disks , and perhaps even in the flow in the earth s polar vortex . </S>"
