    "the natural inclinations of alternative theories of gravity , beside capturing those solar system ( and standard cosmic ) predictions of general relativity , is to generate a self contained theory of gravitation , applicable to comprehend the universe without relying on dark energy or dark matter .",
    "however talking about matter , somehow arises the necessity of matter - gravity coupling which has not been yet achieved in the shape of a fully re - normalizable theory of gravitation . to do so",
    ", such theory may become impregnated by massive gravitational quanta ( gravitons ) , not unlike that of fierz and pauli in 1939 @xcite .",
    "the lorentz invariant fierz - pauli massive spin-2 theory however appears to suffer some shortcomings , preventing it of becoming a reliable massive gravity theory ; like strong coupling in infrared ranges @xcite which necessitates a uv completion to be presumable within small ranges like the solar system .",
    "in fact it is well - known that if gravitation were to describe massive gravitons of mass @xmath0 , then the resultant perturbations would be so small and negligible inside the compton wavelength @xmath1 , with @xmath2 to be the speed of light .",
    "intuitively , the mass of gravitons are included through adding a term to the gravitational action , implying non - zero mass in the linearized level",
    ". however what is mostly observed in massive theories of gravity is that the gravitons become massive through the higgs mechanism , under the impact of scalar fields induced in a gauge - invariant gravitational action @xcite .",
    "however besides the above lorentz - invariant theories , the lorentz - violating massive gravity theories have also appeared to be in the focus of a large amount of research and discussions . in these theories ,",
    "the mass is acquired through the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( for very expressive notes on lorentz - invariant / violating massive theories please see ref.s  @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we also consider a lorentz - violating massive theory , and now that these theories do assign non - zero mass to the gravitational particles , it makes sense to investigate the way that such particles move on time - like trajectories on the geometric background described by the theory .",
    "indeed one can consider the time - like gravitons moving on black holes , formed in massive gravity .",
    "such black holes were discussed in ref.s  @xcite and also the effective potentials and their corresponding orbits of test massive particles moving on a lorentz - violating massive gravity black hole has investigated in ref .",
    "however the very concept of a typical black hole is usually granted by the formation of a singularity , mostly discussed on the premise of hawking - penrose singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "traditionally , such theorems are approached by the time - like and null - like combinations of raychaudhuri s kinematical decomposition and his famous equation @xcite .",
    "indeed the raychaudhuri equation is also of great significance in treating the ( an)isotropic cosmological models based on a vorticity - free fluid , and also performs a key role in examining the focusing of a congruence of particle trajectories while falling onto singular regions such as black holes . in the case of massive gravity however , those time - like congruences falling onto black holes are essentially consisting of massive gravitons . in this regard ,",
    "the congruence basically holds a mixture of quantum particles moving in a gravitational field .",
    "a way to dealing with this , goes through the bohmian behaviour of quantum particles in a curved spacetime , while they are affected by a bohmian quantum potential ( for a very good review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . accordingly",
    ", a congruence of massive gravitons can be decomposed into spacetime and quantum kinematical characteristics . to include this",
    ", one has to modify the raychaudhuri equation in order to contain both of these categories .",
    "it was das @xcite , who applied such a modification and later it was shown that this modified version results in the correctly evaluated graviton mass in the limit of the associated compton wave length @xcite",
    ". therefore it makes sense to regard time - like trajectories in massive theories of gravity , as those under the influence of a bohmian quantum potential , and decompose them by means of a quantum corrected raychuadhuri equation ( qre ) . in this paper",
    "we also consider such a situation in the context of a lorentz - violating massive theory of gravity .",
    "these steps are tackled : in sec .",
    "[ sec : time - like general ] we calculate a radially propagated time - like congruence of massive particles in a general spherically symmetric background spacetime geometry and impose the results in the qre to obtain a general framework for the quantum potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : massive gravity ] we consider the special case of a lorentz - violating massive theory of gravity and exploit its spherically symmetric solution in order to specify the quantum potential for two different cases of study .",
    "there , and for each case , we discuss the energy conditions upon which the graviton congruence can avoid any geodesic incompleteness ( focusing ) .",
    "such condition is crucial to bohmian trajectories .",
    "determination of such quantum potentials helps us to study each case separately . furthermore and in sec .",
    "[ sec : frequency ] , we switch to a klein - gordon type equation to rule a non - geodesic congruence of gravitons , bounded by a quantum potential .",
    "this way we can replicate the procedure of finding divergence , in a way that instead of geodesic equations , the trajectories are essentially emerge from their confinement to the bohmian quantum potential .",
    "we apply this to find conditions on the associated frequency to the gravitons .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . throughout this paper",
    "we denote overdots for differentiation with respect to the congruence parametrization and primes for differentiation with respect to radial coordinate . also 4-dimensional indices are presented by @xmath3 , whereas those 3-dimensional ones , by @xmath4 .",
    "assume a congruence of massive particles falling onto a region , geometrically described by the line element @xmath5 with @xmath6 to be the proper time and here , the congruence parametrization .",
    "now if a radially propagated time - like congruence is generated by a time - like vector field @xmath7 , then it is governed by the condition @xmath8 , characterizing the light cone structure by @xmath9 defining the 4-momentum @xmath10 , then it is straightforward to write down the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath11 the motion of massive particles on such congruence can be also expressed in terms of the particles energy @xmath12 , as a constant of motion .",
    "indeed one can define @xmath13 @xcite , giving @xmath14 with @xmath15 to be a dimensionless ratio , illustrating that to what extent the energy of a test particle can approach to that in the asymptote .",
    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ eq : timelike condtion - general ] ) yields @xmath16 it is straightforward to show that @xmath17 is parallel - transported along the congruence it generates ( @xmath18 ) , so the congruence is a geodesic congruence . now",
    "if we consider a cross - sectional 3-surface , transverse to the congruence generated by @xmath17 , then one can define the transverse expansion @xcite @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is the metric describing the cross - sectional surface .",
    "accordingly , for a radially propagated bohmian congruence of massive gravitons ( axions ) under the influence of the quantum potential @xmath21 , the transverse expansion evolution is governed by the rotation - less qre , which in the @xmath22 sign convention is of the form @xcite @xmath23 in the above equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the symmetric trace - less shear tensor .",
    "also @xmath26 is the ricci tensor and @xmath27 .",
    "the congruence avoids geodesic incompleteness ( convergence or focusing ) if @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "moreover the dimensionless coefficient @xmath29 is supposed to be @xmath30 for conformally invariant theories describing massless particles , whereas for massive dirac particle it is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the quantum potential is indeed the rate of change of the amplitude @xmath32 of an associated flat wave function @xmath33 with respect to the background spacetime and has been essentially defined by @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : metric - general ] ) .",
    "we will do this in the next section to derive specific quantum potentials in the case that the metric potential is expressed in a massive theory of gravity .",

    ", we go through this approach to reconcile our treatment onto the behaviour of non - geodesic graviton congruence . therefore , and to obtain appropriate conformity with the usual formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics in the literature and also with ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the @xmath98 sign convention throughout this section ( the metric associated to eq .",

    "using eq.s  ( [ eq : expansion - general ] ) and ( [ eq : solution ] ) , the mentioned scalar for @xmath55 becomes @xmath121 one can examine its dependence on @xmath105 in the solar system scale , as we have shown in the previous section .",
    "it can be observed form fig .",
    "[ fig : quantum - lambda=1 ] that for any typical value of @xmath105 , the divergence is guaranteed . in this case , the gravitons are in need of attaining very small values of energy .",
    "however everything changes once we turn to the strong gravitational effects on gravitons . in this case , namely for @xmath56 , the scalar @xmath122 becomes rather complicated and is indeed of order 20 in distance . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : quantum - lambda=4 ] which has been plotted for the cosmological range we considered in the previous section , no quantum potential can confine gravitons to exist on diverging congruences ; they will eventually converge .",
    "it is observed that they obtain much greater values of energy .",
    "one if the essential features of qre is that it prevents any congruence of massive gravitons from crossing .",
    "on the other hand , all theories with massive gravitons agree upon extremely weak couplings of matter and gravity , which becomes even completely negligible inside associated compton wavelength . in this paper",
    "we examined one lorentz - violating massive theory by finding the quantum potential , needed by the graviton congruence to avoid convergence .",
    "being rather sensitive to the parameter @xmath53 , the spherically symmetric background spacetime was applied by splitting up to two distinct categories @xmath123 which inspections revealed that divergence becomes possible when the test particles energies do not exceed those in the asymptote . for the case of @xmath55 and under the solar system conditions , it became clear that as it was expected , very small amounts of quantum potential can provide permanent divergence .",
    "such values show that the applied massive theory of gravity with @xmath55 is totally consistence with qre , even in the regions inside the associated compton wavelength .",
    "however for the case of @xmath56 , the qre results in huge values of quantum potential within such conditions .",
    "in fact it turns out that @xmath93 is only reasonable on the compton wavelength , and inside , it is not .",
    "hence , one can infer that the applied massive theory for @xmath56 will indeed break down its integrity with the qre since it shows strong coupling to matter .",
    "one reason , appears to be because of the strong gravitational field in the case of @xmath56 , provided by the black hole solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) . in such situations",
    ", we can no longer consider linearized couplings of matter fields and gravitational action .",
    "in fact the vigorous gravitational force violates weak coupling between gravity and matter .",
    "because of such conditions , the massive theory fail to conform to the qre for higher values of @xmath53 .",
    "this was also shown through another approach , where the gravitons were considered to be initially bounded by a confined hamilton - jacobi condition , to the quantum potential .",
    "this provided us a relativistic quantum viewpoint for bosons like graviton which were regarded as a wave function described on a fixed background .",
    "this way , we discussed the validity of diverging non - geodesic time - like congruences in both cases of @xmath124 . there",
    ", once again , it appeared that the strong gravitational effect will break the conformity with the necessity of divergence , because the @xmath56 case shows permanent convergence .",
    "it should be noted that , even though the hamilton - jacobi equation for free particles may confirm possible divergence in large scales , however it is not still the case once the particles are supposed to originate from a quantum potential and move on non - geodesic trajectories . in conclusion , if qre is supposed to be exploited to investigate congruence evolutions in black hole regions , one should be aware of possible extensions and the capabilities of the gravitational theory , in generating extremely strong fields ."
