    "recent experiments at jlab have yielded beautiful data for the @xmath0he@xmath1@xmath2 cross section and longitudinal - transverse asymmetry up to missing momenta @xmath6 and 0.6 gev / c  @xcite , respectively , and the three - body breakup cross section @xmath0he@xmath1@xmath7@xmath8 for missing momenta and energies ( @xmath9 ) in the range @xmath3 up to 0.84 gev / c and @xmath9 up to 140 mev  @xcite .",
    "these data have spurred renewed interest in these reactions , which has led to a series of papers  @xcite , dealing with the theoretical description of the proton - knockout mechanism and , in particular , with the treatment of final state interactions ( fsi ) at gev energies .    in the present work ,",
    "we contribute to this effort . as in refs .",
    "@xcite we adopt the glauber approximation to describe the rescattering processes between the struck proton and the nucleons in the recoiling deuteron .",
    "however , in contrast to the studies of refs .",
    "@xcite , we retain the full spin and isospin dependence of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath10@xmath10 ) scattering amplitude from which the glauber profile operator is derived , and do not make use of the factorization approximation , which allows one to write the @xmath1 cross section on a nucleus in terms of a proton cross section times a distorted spectral function .",
    "a number of issues pertaining to the parameterization of the @xmath10@xmath10 amplitude , and its boosting from the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame to the frame in which rescattering occurs , are discussed in considerable detail .",
    "the spin dependence of the @xmath10@xmath10 amplitudes will turn out to play an important role in the high @xmath3 region where double rescattering effects become dominant .",
    "it is not clear that one is justified in ignoring it , particularly in the analysis of experiments , such as the @xmath11he@xmath12@xmath0h reaction  @xcite , in which the polarizations of the ejected proton are measured  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wcss ] we briefly review the bound - state wave functions and the model for the electromagnetic current operator , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : glb ] the glauber approximation , the profile operator , and the parameterization for the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude are discussed .",

    "[ sec : res ] we present a detailed discussion of the results , including a critical comparison between the present and earlier studies , while in sec .  [",
    "sec : concl ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the @xmath0he wave function and the model for the nuclear electromagnetic current .",
    "the discussion is rather cursory , since both these aspects of the calculations presented in this work have already been reviewed in considerable detail in a number of earlier papers .",
    "references to these are included below .",
    "the ground states of the @xmath13=3 nuclei are represented by variational wave functions , derived from a realistic hamiltonian consisting of the argonne @xmath14 two - nucleon ( @xmath10@xmath10 )  @xcite and urbana - ix three - nucleon ( @xmath10@xmath10@xmath10 )  @xcite interactions  the av18/uix hamiltonian model  with the correlated hyperspherical - harmonics ( chh ) method  @xcite .",
    "the high accuracy of the chh wave functions is well documented  @xcite , as is the quality of the av18/uix hamiltonian in successfully and quantitatively accounting for a wide variety of three - nucleon bound - state properties and reactions , ranging from binding energies , charge radii , and elastic form factors  @xcite to low - energy radiative and weak capture cross sections and polarization observables  @xcite , to the quasi - elastic response in inclusive @xmath15 scattering at intermediate energies  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic current includes one- and two - body terms ,    @xmath16    the one - body current and charge operators have the form recently derived by jeschonnek and donnelly  @xcite from an expansion of the covariant single - nucleon current , in which only terms dependent quadratically on the initial nucleon momentum ( and higher order terms ) are neglected . in momentum space , they are explicitly given by    @xmath17    @xmath18 \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the virtual photon three - momentum ( energy ) transfer , @xmath21 is the four - momentum transfer with @xmath22=@xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the nucleon mass , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the momentum and spin operators of nucleon @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the nucleon sachs form factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined as    @xmath33 \\ , \\ ] ]    where the @xmath22 dependence is understood , and @xmath34 is the @xmath35-component of the isospin .",
    "the hhler parameterization  @xcite is used for the proton and neutron electric and magnetic form factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the form adopted above for the one - body currents is well suited for dealing with processes in which the energy transfer may be large ( i.e. , the ratio of four- to three - momentum transfer @xmath38 is not close to one ) and the initial momentum of the nucleon absorbing the virtual photon is small .",
    "thus , its use is certainly justified in quasi - elastic kinematics for moderate values of the missing momentum .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath39 one recovers the standard non - relativistic expressions for the impulse - approximation currents ( including the spin - orbit correction to the charge operator ) .",
    "the two - body charge , @xmath40 , and current , @xmath41 , operators consist of a model - independentpart , that is constructed from the @xmath10@xmath10 interaction ( the av18 in the present case ) , and a model - dependentone , associated with the excitation of nucleons to @xmath42 resonances ( for @xmath43 only ) and @xmath44 and @xmath45 transitions ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "improvements in the construction of the model - independent two - body currents originating from the momentum - dependent terms of the @xmath10@xmath10 interaction have been recently reported in ref .  @xcite . in this latter work , three - body currents associated with @xmath10@xmath10@xmath10 interactions have also been derived .",
    "both these refinements , however , are expected to have little impact on the results of the present study , and therefore are not considered any further .",
    "the present model for two - body charge and current operators is quite realistic at small momentum transfers .",
    "however , for processes involving momentum and energy transfers of order 1 gev , such as the @xmath0he(@xmath46)@xmath2 reaction under consideration here for which @xmath47=1.50 gev / c and @xmath20=0.84 gev , it is likely to have additional corrections .",
    "in the kinematics considered in sec .  [ sec : res ] , the proton lab kinetic energies are typically of the order 0.5 gev or larger .",
    "these energies are obviously beyond the range of applicability of @xmath10@xmath10 interaction models , such as the av18 , which are constrained to reproduce @xmath10@xmath10 elastic scattering data up to the pion production threshold . at higher energies ,",
    "@xmath10@xmath10 scattering becomes strongly absorptive with the opening of particle production channels .",
    "indeed , the @xmath7@xmath7 inelastic cross section at 0.5 gev increases abruptly from about 2 mb to 30 mb , and remains essentially constant for energies up to several hundred gev  @xcite .    on the other hand , the small momentum transfer which characterizes scattering processes at high energies makes the glauber approximation  @xcite particularly well suited in this regime .",
    "another advantage is its reliance on a @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude , which is fitted to data .",
    "it is the approach we adopt in the present work to describe the wave function of the final @xmath7+(@xmath48 ) system as    @xmath49    where @xmath50 represents a proton in spin state @xmath51 , @xmath52 denotes the wave function of the ( @xmath48)-system with spin projection @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the center - of - mass position vector of the @xmath48 nucleons in this cluster .",
    "the sum over permutations @xmath55 of parity @xmath56 ensures the overall antisymmetry of @xmath57 .",
    "the operator @xmath58 inducing final - state - interactions ( fsi ) can be derived from an analysis of the multiple scattering series by requiring that the struck ( fast ) nucleon ( nucleon @xmath13 ) moves in a straight - line trajectory ( that is , it is undeflected by rescattering processes ) , and that the nucleons in the residual system ( nucleons @xmath59 ) act as fixed scattering centers  @xcite ( the so - called _ frozen approximation _ ) .",
    "it is expanded as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 represents the @xmath62 rescattering term , and therefore for an @xmath13-body system up to @xmath48 rescattering terms are generally present .",
    "the leading single - rescattering term reads    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the longitudinal and transverse components of @xmath66 relative to @xmath67 , the direction of the nucleon momentum ,    @xmath68    and the step - function @xmath69 , @xmath70 if @xmath71 , prevents the occurrence of backward scattering for the struck nucleon .",
    "the profile operator@xmath72 , to be discussed below , is related to the fourier transform of the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude at the invariant energy @xmath73 .",
    "the double - rescattering term , relevant for the present study of the @xmath0he(@xmath46)@xmath2 reaction , is given by    @xmath74    where the product of @xmath75-functions ensures the correct sequence of rescattering processes in the forward hemisphere .",
    "for example , if @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then nucleon @xmath13 scatters first from nucleon @xmath78 and then from nucleon @xmath30 . note that the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 do not generally commute .      at this stage",
    "it is useful to specify the kinematics of the various rescattering processes occurring in the glauber expansion .",
    "specializing to the @xmath0he(@xmath46)@xmath2 reaction of interest here , the single- and double - rescattering terms are illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : glb ] . in this figure ,",
    "nucleon 3 denotes the knocked - out nucleon with momentum @xmath82=@xmath83 and energy @xmath84=@xmath85 in the lab frame , while nucleons 1 and 2 , making up the deuteron , have momenta @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , with @xmath86+@xmath87=@xmath88 ( again , in the lab frame ) .",
    "the black solid circle represents the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude . in the single - rescattering case , the @xmath10@xmath10 amplitudes in the two terms ( panel a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : glb ] only shows one of them ) are evaluated at the invariant energies @xmath89 , @xmath30=1,2 , with    @xmath90    where in the second line it has been assumed that i ) the nucleons are on their mass shells , and ii ) nucleons 1 and 2 in the recoiling deuteron share its momentum equally , @xmath91 .",
    "the momenta of nucleon 3 and nucleon @xmath30 , @xmath30=1,2 , after rescattering are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denotes the momentum transfer . the spectator nucleon ( @xmath95 ) has momentum @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the rescattering framewe refer to in the following is defined as that in which nucleon 3 ( nucleon @xmath30 ) have initial and final momenta @xmath83 and @xmath92 ( @xmath96 and @xmath93 ) , respectively .    in the case of double rescattering , panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : glb ] , a similar analysis can be carried out .",
    "in particular , it leads in the eikonal limit to the approximation in which both @xmath10@xmath10 amplitudes are evaluated at the invariant energies @xmath97 , as obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kin ] ) .",
    "the profile operator @xmath81 is related to the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude in the rescattering frame , denoted as @xmath98 , via the fourier transform    @xmath99    where , in the eikonal limit , the momentum transfer @xmath94 is perpendicular to @xmath83 .",
    "the isospin symmetry of the strong interactions allows one to express @xmath100 as    @xmath101    where the @xmath102 are related to the physical amplitudes for @xmath7@xmath7 and @xmath7@xmath8 scattering via    @xmath103    available parameterizations of the @xmath7@xmath7 and @xmath7@xmath8 amplitudes are given in the c.m .",
    "frame  @xcite , and therefore one needs to boost these from the c.m .  to the rescattering frame . in the discussion that follows , the general form of the c.m .  amplitude and its parameterization",
    "are described first , while the boosting procedure adopted in the present work is illustrated next .",
    "it is well known that the most general form for the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude in the c.m .",
    "frame reads ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein )    @xmath104    where @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the initial and final nucleon momenta , respectively , the @xmath107 s are functions of the invariant energy @xmath108 and momentum transfer @xmath109 ( with @xmath110 ) , and a possible choice for the five operators @xmath111 , especially convenient for our present purposes , is that given in ref .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath112    here the unit vector @xmath113 is defined as @xmath114 ( @xmath115 in the eikonal limit ) , and the overline on the various quantities in the equations above is to indicate that they are given in the c.m .",
    "frame . the factor @xmath116 in the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnn ] ) is conventional .",
    "the functions @xmath117 are parameterized as    @xmath118 \\ , \\ ] ]    where the @xmath119 and @xmath120 coefficients depend on @xmath121 and are generally complex ; in particular , the forward , spin - independent amplitude @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 ( an invariant quantity ) , where @xmath124 is the total cross section and @xmath125 is the ratio of the imaginary to the real part of @xmath122 . in the present work",
    "these coefficients are taken from tables iii and iv of ref .",
    "@xcite : they were obtained by fitting @xmath10@xmath10 amplitudes derived from the phase - shift analysis of the vpi group  @xcite .",
    "the tabulations are for @xmath121 values in the range ( 3.925.09 ) gev , corresponding to lab kinetic energies ( 210831 ) mev , for both @xmath7@xmath7 and @xmath7@xmath8 scattering .",
    "a detailed assessment of the accuracy and limitations of these parameterizations ( of course , in relation to the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering data available up to 1981 ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", it suffices to note only that they are reasonably accurate for the central and single spin - flip terms for @xmath126 up to @xmath127 ( gev / c)@xmath128 ; however , double spin - flip terms are not well fitted by ( single ) gaussian functions",
    ".    it would be desirable to update and improve the parameterizations of ref .",
    "@xcite by using phase - shift analyses based on the current @xmath10@xmath10 database .",
    "unfortunately , at the higher lab energies of interest here ( say , above 500 mev ) the increase in the size of this database has been rather modest since the early 1980 s .",
    "it is worth pointing out that all previous glauber calculations of @xmath13(@xmath129 processes we are aware of have ignored the double spin - flip terms in the scattering amplitude , corresponding to @xmath27=2 , 4 , and 5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnn ] ) ; indeed , most have only included the spin independent term ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , note that , if the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnn ] ) were to consist only of the scalar term ( @xmath27=1 ) , then the transformation to the lab frame would be unnecessary , since @xmath130 would be an invariant function of @xmath121 and the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath131=@xmath132 .",
    "however , the presence of the spin - dependent terms spoils this simplicity .      in order to boost the @xmath10@xmath10 scattering amplitude from the c.m .  to the rescattering frame",
    ", we adopt the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , although its practical implementation in the present work is approximate for reasons discussed below .",
    "first , an invariant representation of the amplitude is introduced in terms of scalar , vector ( @xmath133 ) , tensor ( @xmath134 ) , pseudoscalar ( @xmath135 ) , and axial vector ( @xmath136 ) combinations of dirac matrices :    @xmath137    where the five operators @xmath138 are defined as    @xmath139    the relation between the functions @xmath140 and @xmath107 in the c.m .",
    "frame follows by noting that    @xmath141   \\chi_{\\sigma_i } \\chi_{\\sigma_j } \\ , \\ ] ]    where the @xmath142 are ( positive - energy ) dirac spinors with @xmath143 , and @xmath144 are two - component pauli spinors .",
    "this leads in the eikonal limit @xmath145 to    @xmath146    where the matrix @xmath147 is the inverse of that given in tables i and ii of ref .",
    "in fact , the @xmath109 dependence in the matrix @xmath147 is neglected , i.e.  @xmath148 , in the present work , which allows one to write @xmath140 , @xmath149 , as a linear combination of terms , each having , as far as the momentum transfer dependence is concerned , the same gaussian functional form as @xmath150 .",
    "this turns out to be convenient when performing the fourier transform in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prof ] ) .    next , having determined the functions @xmath140 , the scattering amplitude in the rescattering frame is obtained from    @xmath151 \\chi_{\\sigma_i } \\chi_{\\sigma_j}= \\overline{u}_{\\sigma_i^\\prime}({\\bf p}-{\\bf k } ) \\overline{u}_{\\sigma_j^\\prime}({\\bf p}_d/2+{\\bf k } ) { \\cal f}^{nn}_{ij } u_{\\sigma_i}({\\bf p } ) u_{\\sigma_j}({\\bf p}_d/2 ) \\ , \\label{eq : fres}\\ ] ]    where in practice",
    "the dependence upon @xmath96 in the spinors of particle @xmath78 has been neglected ( in this limit , the rescattering and lab frames coincide ) .",
    "this approximation is justified at low @xmath152 ( corresponding to low missing momenta ) , but is clearly unsatisfactory at high @xmath152 ( @xmath153 gev / c in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the resulting @xmath154 has central , single and double spin - flip terms .    the approximations above  neglecting the dependence of the matrix @xmath147 on the momentum transfer in eq .",

    "this latter task , however , is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "to set the stage for the discussions that follow in later sections , it is helpful to give the expression of the five - fold differential cross section for the @xmath155@xmath1@xmath156 process ( for a derivation , see ref .",

    "<S> the @xmath0he@xmath1@xmath2 reaction is studied using an accurate three - nucleon bound state wave function , a model for the electromagnetic current operator including one- and two - body terms , and the glauber approximation for the treatment of final state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier studies , the profile operator in the glauber expansion is derived from a nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude , which retains its full spin and isospin dependence and is consistent with phase - shift analyses of two - nucleon scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude is boosted from the center - of - mass frame , where parameterizations for it are available , to the frame where rescattering occurs . </S>",
    "<S> exact monte carlo methods are used to evaluate the relevant matrix elements of the electromagnetic current operator . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted cross section is found to be in quantitative agreement with the experimental data for values of the missing momentum @xmath3 in the range ( 0700 ) mev / c , but underestimates the data at @xmath4 gev / c by about a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> however , the longitudinal - transverse asymmetry , measured up to @xmath5 600 mev / c , is well reproduced by theory . </S>",
    "<S> a critical comparison is carried out between the results obtained in the present work and those of earlier studies . </S>"
