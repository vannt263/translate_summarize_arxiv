    "the isogal programme ( omont et al . 1999 , 2001 ) has made use of the iso satellite to obtain detailed surveys of sample areas of the inner bulge and the galactic plane at two mid - infrared wavelengths , 7@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m , with the intention of investigating the longitude and latitude variations of stellar properties and their bearing on galactic structure .",
    "because many of the fields are highly obscured , parts of the relatively clear baade s windows were included for comparison purposes ( glass et al .",
    "1999 ) . by studying the contents of the latter at infrared and visible wavelengths",
    "one obtains a picture of the basic stellar population in the bulge , to which more heavily obscured fields , observable only in the infrared , can be compared .",
    "fields of 15 @xmath5 15 arcmin@xmath6 from each of sgr i and ngc6522 were thus included in the isogal work .",
    "these were centred at @xmath7 = + 1.37@xmath8 , @xmath9 = 2.63@xmath8 and @xmath7 = + 1.03@xmath8 , @xmath9 = 3.83@xmath8 respectively .",
    "near - infrared data at @xmath10(0.79@xmath0 m ) , @xmath11(1.22@xmath0 m ) and @xmath3(2.14@xmath0 m ) , where the subscript @xmath12 denotes ` short ' , for both windows are now available from the denis survey ( epchtein , 1998 ) and for the sgri window only at @xmath11(@xmath131.22@xmath0 m ) , @xmath14(1.65@xmath0 m ) and @xmath3(2.16@xmath0 m ) from 2mass ( skrutskie , 1998 ) . in addition , photometry on the caltech - ctio system by frogel and whitford ( 1987 , hereafter fw ) was obtained for many of the m stars in the objective prism survey of the ngc6522 field by blanco , mccarthy and blanco ( 1984 ) and blanco ( 1986 ) . a comparison of stars detected by isogal with the latter survey indicates that , except for a few probable foreground stars , none with spectral type earlier than m2 were seen .",
    "the rate of detection increased with sub - type , reaching 100% at m6 .",
    "several previous surveys of these fields for variable stars have been made .",
    "@xmath10-band photography by lloyd evans ( 1976 ) yielded identifications and periods of many miras . a search for the near - infrared counterparts of iras sources ( glass 1986 ) revealed some additional long - period , large - amplitude variables that were not found in the @xmath10-band survey .",
    "infrared observations of nearly all the long - period , large - amplitude variables in sgr i were obtained by glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , so that the sample is probably complete and the period distribution , period - luminosity relation and period - colour properties of miras in sgr i may be regarded as known .",
    "the sgri and ngc6522 windows formed part of the macho gravitational lens survey .",
    "alard et al . ( 2001 ) present variability information for all 332 stars that have been detected at both isogal and both macho wavelengths : @xmath15(@xmath130.54@xmath0 m ) , @xmath16(@xmath130.70@xmath0 m ) , 7@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m .",
    "nearly all of the 332 objects were found to be semi - regular variables ( srvs ) with periods of from 10 to 230 days and amplitudes @xmath17 1 mag . and will be referred to collectively here as the isogal / macho sample .",
    "the srvs in the present fields outnumber the miras by a factor of about 20 .",
    "note that the area surveyed by macho omits about 10% of each isogal field .",
    "we have assumed that the interstellar absorption is @xmath18=1.5 mag for both fields .",

    "all objects falling in the isogal fields have been extracted from the denis and 2mass databases as well as the fw work .",

    "the denis observations form part of a dedicated survey of the galactic bulge ( simon et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the 2mass observations are limited to sgri and a small part of ngc6522 with the consequence that only 225 of the 332 isogal / macho stars fall within the common area . in this and the following section we show by direct comparisons that the available information is consistent .",
    "firstly , it is necessary to consider what effect the different filter systems may be expected to have on the photometry .",
    "the denis filters have been convolved with the typical atmospheric transmission at la silla ( fouqu et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the survey was made .",

    "the effective long wavelength end of the @xmath11-band is determined by atmospheric transmission at about 1.35@xmath0 m .",
    "important differences between systems occur in the @xmath11- and @xmath24-bands .",
    "the caltech - ctio system as used by fw has an effective @xmath11 wavelength ( see @xmath25 in fig .  4 of persson et al .",

    "the two surveys were conducted during the same year and season .",
    "we have also plotted the differences between the denis and 2mass photometry for all stars in common in the isogal field against ( j  k ) and find no significant trend .",
    "fig 2 shows histograms of the differences between the denis and the fw data for ngc6522 in the sense ( denis  fw ) .",
    "it should be noted that the size of the sample is small and some degree of variability is likely in almost all the stars .",

    "the corresponding figures for 2mass are 13 pixels / object in @xmath11 and @xmath3 and 12 pixels / object in @xmath14 . almost certainly , the reliability of detection and the accuracy of the photometry decreases towards the faint end , but a full discussion of these issues awaits the publication of the catalogues .",
    "there are 201 isogal / macho stars in sgri , of which 196 were detected by denis and 187 ( of which 185 were in common with denis ) by 2mass .",
    "the two 2mass stars not detected by denis lay along the edge of the field and may have been lost due to slightly different astrometric solutions .",
    "= 8.3 cm    fig 5 shows the @xmath39 diagram for the 2mass data from sgr i. although the 2mass data show smaller scatter , the denis data show fewer objects with outlying high @xmath40 colours .",
    "an investigation of such objects from the general field of sgri showed that in denis some were not recorded , some had @xmath11 but not @xmath24 detections and the remainder had ordinary @xmath41 colours .",
    "we distinguish with special symbols the isogal / macho variables with high mass - loss , defined by [ 7 ] - [ 15 ] @xmath38 0.6 and [ 15 ] @xmath17 7.5 , the latter criterion being used to eliminate objects with high probable errors .",

    "i.e. , they are macho stars not identified with reliable mid - infrared sources .",
    "in what follows we include some solar neighbourhood giants for comparison purposes .",
    "these have been derived from the spectrophotometric atlases of lw and pickles ( 1998 ) .",
    "their colours have been calculated assuming the eso and denis photometric response functions .",
    "recourse to this ` synthetic ' photometry , based on spectrophotometry , is necessary because no data that combine the @xmath10 band with @xmath45 exist outside the denis work .",

    "there is a continuous well - defined sequence from left to right .",
    "the lw and pickles ( 1998 ) stars cover the giants from medium to late spectral types . by comparison with the colours of the latter ,",
    "it is apparent that the clumped denis objects are predominantly of k- and early m - type , with smaller numbers of earlier and later types .",
    "the isogal / macho stars without dust show a rapid increase in @xmath46 with @xmath42 colour as the @xmath10-band strength decreases due to increasing tio and vo absorption at lower temperatures .",
    "finally , the most extreme colours are shown by the stars with dust excesses that are also the most luminous .",
    "the sequence shows much greater scatter about a given point in @xmath47 and @xmath46 than in @xmath42 .",
    "fig 7 shows the @xmath48 diagram .",
    "again a clear sequence is seen from the lw and pickles ( 1998 ) stars through the great mass of 2mass objects , to the isogal / macho stars .",
    "the average colours of miras in sgr i from glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , computed for various period groups and shifted to the right by 0.07 mag , to allow for the difference in the @xmath24 filters , are also shown as a solid line .    in general , the @xmath4 and @xmath49 colours , which are sensitive to metallicity ( see comparison of lmc and sgri miras in glass et al . 1995 ) and atmospheric extension ( bessell et al .",
    "1989 ) , of the srvs and miras of the baade s window population agree closely with the solar neighbourhood sample .",
    "the periods of the srvs are by their very nature not very well - defined .",
    "the techniques for determining them from the macho data and their limitations have been described by alard et al .",
    "essentially , the periods given here are those that were dominant during the years of the macho observations . in some cases , other ( usually nearby ) periods had nearly equal fourier amplitudes .",
    "fig 8 shows the colour - period plots for the available samples .",
    "one should recollect that appreciable mass - loss is only seen for those stars that have periods in excess of 70d ( alard et al .",
    "2001 ) , but a longer period does not guarantee that it will occur .",
    "this is also true of field srvs , as found from co observations ( kerschbaum olofsson & hron 1996 ) .",
    "the colours of miras can vary by 0.1 mag or more around a cycle .",
    "note that an individual variable star from lw may be represented by more than one point in these diagrams since their observations were often made at more than one phase .      in all",
    "colours it is apparent that the colours of the srvs increase on the average with period .",
    "however , it is noticeable that the scatter in @xmath10 at a given period is 34 mags whereas in the other colours it is much less ( up to 0.7 ) .",
    "alvarez et al . ( 2000 ) show that there is a close relationship ( s.d .",
    "= 0.09 mag ) of wide validity between @xmath51 and @xmath52 colour for o - rich stars .",
    "the miras do not show any clear colour - period relation .      because of the poor overlap between the available 2mass data and the ngc6522 isogal field , most of the stars in the diagrams involving the @xmath14-band are from sgri .",
    "it is expected that the observed @xmath53 colours will not differ significantly between the 2mass and eso or saao systems .",
    "the semiregulars show a moderate increase in @xmath54 colour with period .",
    "they overlap , particularly at the longer - period end , the field srvs ( e.g. , kerschbaum & hron 1994 , not shown in the figures in order to avoid confusion ) .",
    "our knowledge of the statistics of short - period field srvs is limited at present by their small amplitudes and the consequent difficulty of detecting them by traditional methods .",
    "only recently have systematic studies become possible using photometry from the hipparcos satellite ( bedding & zijlstra 1998 ; koen & laney , 2000 ) .    that the miras are displaced from the region of srvs in the @xmath4 , @xmath49 diagram has been known for many years ( see e.g. feast et al , 1982 , and references therein ) .",
    "the lw atlas shows definitively that stars which exhibit strong h@xmath32o absorption bands during their pulsation cycles have large amplitudes .",
    "now that this effect can be displayed on a @xmath4 , log@xmath43 diagram ( fig .",
    "8b ) , the displacement caused by the water - vapour absorption bands is seen to be quite dramatic at periods of about 150200 days . in this connection , it is also interesting to note that that the spectra of bulge miras can be matched very closely by non - mira spectra differing only by the absence of h@xmath32o features ( lw ) .",
    "the observed @xmath4 colours from glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are slightly redder on average than the points derived from the lw spectrophotometry of field miras , though similar to the colours obtained by kerschbaum ( unpublished ) and others for field miras .",
    "this difference may reflect the difficulty of allowing for the terrestrial atmospheric water vapour absorption in deriving the synthetic photometry .",
    "we also comment that the lw points representing t cen , classed as a srv ( open circles ) with period 90d ( log @xmath43 = 1.95 ) , are unusually low in this and the other colour - period diagrams .",
    "its visual amplitude of 3.5mag is excessive for a srv , suggesting that it is a mira variable of unusually short period .",
    "the @xmath56 colours of the srvs increase with period in much the same way as the @xmath54 .",
    "it is more noticeable in this diagram than in the @xmath53 vs log @xmath43 that the srvs with [ 7 ] [15 ] excesses are redder than those without , at a given period .",
    "the lw points for field srvs are in agreement with the srvs of similar period with low mass - loss .",
    "the miras form a well - defined sequence which , however , starts below the average @xmath56 of the srvs at the same period ( @xmath13180d ) .",
    "the sgri relation appears to straddle the lw field miras satisfactorily , though the scatter of the latter is rather large .      the @xmath42 index , like the others , increases steadily with period for the srvs , especially those with strong mass - loss from [ 7 ] [15 ] photometry .",
    "the redder colours of the mass - losing objects are even more obvious .",
    "a version of this diagram , based on transformed 7@xmath0 m mags , was presented by alard et al .",
    "it is given here with @xmath3 mags directly from 2mass .",
    "the conclusions of alard et al .",
    "remain unchanged .",
    "absolute @xmath24 magnitudes of srvs with periods are available for only a few other samples .",
    "they include nearby objects with parallaxes from the hipparcos catalogue ( bedding & zijlstra , 1998 ) and those in the large magellanic cloud ( wood , 2000 ) with periods also derived from macho .",
    "whitelock ( 1986 ) showed that srvs in low - metallicity galactic globular clusters exhibit a p - l sequence that falls about 0.8 mag below that of bedding & zijlstra .",
    "= 8.3 cm    in the large magellanic cloud the miras , the srvs and the small - amplitude srvs seem to form distinct parallel sequences c , b , a etc ( see fig .",
    "9 ) which have been identified by wood ( 2000 ) as pulsators in the fundamental , first and the next two higher overtones respectively .",
    "the present data do not show such clearly separated sequences except perhaps between the miras and the others .",
    "the effect may be blurred in the galactic centre relative to the large magellanic cloud by the depth in the line of sight of the bulge .",
    "for example , the scatter of the _ averaged _ @xmath24 mags of miras about the p - l relation is 0.35 mag for the latter as compared to 0.13 for the lmc ( glass et al .",
    "1987 ) .    included in the diagram is a p - l sequence for the hipparcos ( nearby ) srvs from bedding and zijlstra ( 1998 ) .",
    "similar lines , which cross the loci of the various pulsation modes , were predicted by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) as evolutionary sequences , their absolute luminosity depending on initial mass and metallicity .",
    "the position of the line suggests that there is little difference between the bulge and local samples .",
    "the spectra of mira variables in the bulge can also be matched well by local miras ( lw ) .",
    "in the baade s windows @xmath3 , @xmath41 diagram the most luminous stars are the miras and srvs . the srvs with significant mass - loss are generally more luminous than those without .",
    "the average @xmath50 , @xmath4 , @xmath49 and @xmath41 colours of the srvs increase with period but the effect is much less pronounced if the mass - losing stars are omitted .",
    "the scatter in the colours of srvs is greatest in @xmath50 . in all the colours considered here , scatter increases with period .",
    "the average @xmath4 colours of the shorter - period bulge miras ( @xmath13 200d ) are much bluer than the average of the srvs with similar periods .",
    "a similar but less conspicuous discontinuity occurs in the @xmath49 and @xmath41 colours .",
    "this effect is attributed to the onset of h@xmath32o absorption , which affects @xmath14 and @xmath24 more than @xmath11 . in each of @xmath4 , @xmath49 and @xmath41 ,",
    "the average mira colours show steeper rates of increase with period than the srvs .",
    "the colours of solar neighbourhood srvs and miras , derived for the denis and 2mass systems from the lm spectrophotometry , agree with those of the bulge .",
    "in addition , the locations in the @xmath24 , log@xmath43 diagram of the srvs , which should be sensitive to any differences in initial mass and metallicity , are in good agreement .",
