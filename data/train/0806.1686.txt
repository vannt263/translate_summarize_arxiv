    "it is well - known that the luminosity @xmath1 of luminous spiral galaxies correlates tightly with their rotation velocity @xmath2 , as called the tully - fisher relation ( hereafter tfr , * ? ? ?",
    "the tfr is usually described as a power - law scaling relation @xmath3 , and the rms scatter of the tfr is smaller for optical passbands of longer wavelengths . in particular , the i - band tfr is significantly tight and its scatter is approximately as small as 0.4 mag @xcite , with a power - law index @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "light at longer wavelengths from galaxies traces old late - type stars , unaffected by sporadic formation of young stars , and represents the mass of luminous matter .",
    "thus , the tightness of the i - band tfr suggests the existence of some driving mechanism that depends on mass of galaxies in processes of their formation .",
    "the current standard model of cosmology is the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "since the initial spectrum of density fluctuations has larger amplitudes for smaller scales in this model , the scenario of structure formation is hierarchical clustering , in the sense that smaller dark haloes cluster to form larger dark haloes hierarchically , thereby creating a scaling relation between mass @xmath5 and circular velocity @xmath6 of dark haloes @xcite .",
    "high - resolution @xmath7-body simulations , based on a power spectrum @xmath8 with an index @xmath9 appropriate for galaxy scales or reciprocal of wavenumber @xmath10 , have provided @xmath11 , reminiscent of the tfr if a constant mass - to - light @xmath12 ratio is assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the cdm model naturally involves a tfr - like scaling relation as observed for luminous spiral galaxies , because a constant @xmath12 is indeed known to be a good approximation to such galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    when studying the formation of galaxies originated from the growth of density fluctuations in the early universe , however , it is also necessary to take into account the effects of star formation and supernova ( sn ) explosions in individual galaxies .",
    "in particular , dwarf galaxies have shallow gravitational potential wells , so that energy feedback from sn explosions significantly affects their evolution and hence scaling relations that follow . in a framework of monolithic collapse scenario of galaxy formation",
    ", several authors studied scaling relations for dwarf galaxies in two extreme cases , i.e. , the dark matter dominated case in which dark halo dominates the gravitational potential @xcite , and the baryon dominated case of self - gravitating galaxies without dark matter @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived , for the first time by numerical simulations , the tfr for luminous spiral galaxies in the cdm model , using a method of @xmath7-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) combined with star formation and sn feedback explicitly .",
    "they also showed that the star formation rate is regulated for @xmath12 to be almost constant .",
    "however , the zero - point of the tfr turned out to differ from that observed , so that the simulated spiral galaxies were too faint to be consistent with observations at the same circular velocity .",
    "it was therefore pointed out that processes of star formation and sn feedback in current @xmath7-body / sph simulations have to be improved ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "semi - analytic ( sa ) models of galaxy formation have been invented as a complementary approach to numerical simulations , in which complex processes such as star formation and sn feedback are simply modeled on galaxy scales .",
    "sa models have indeed succeeded in reproducing many observational results , for example , the luminosity function of galaxies as well as the tfr , by suppressing the formation of dwarf galaxies owing to sn feedback @xcite .",
    "recent progress in observational techniques has enabled to see much more properties of distant galaxies and faint dwarf galaxies beyond the limit of magnitude attained so far .",
    "in contrast to the success of sa models in accounting for luminous galaxies , they came to face a serious discrepancy between predicted and observed dynamical properties of dwarf galaxies , while reproducing their photometric properties quite well ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    here",
    "we would like to stress that the dynamical response to gas removal induced by sn explosions , which has been overlooked in most sa models , is unavoidable in dwarf , less massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite formulated how the structure of spherical galaxies responds to sn - induced gas removal in a gravitational potential of dark halo , and @xcite incorporated this effect into a sa model to show that many properties of elliptical galaxies , including the faber - jackson relation @xcite , can be reproduced to faint magnitudes of dwarf ellipticals .",
    "a more sophisticated sa model associated with high - resolution @xmath7-body cosmological simulations also provides a good agreement between predicted and observed properties of galaxies @xcite . accordingly , as a natural extension of nagashima & yoshii s trial , it is worth investigating whether such a dynamical effect could also reproduce the observed tfr down to faint magnitudes in spiral galaxies .    in this paper , using the kuzmin disc @xcite as a galaxy disc embedded in a spherical dark halo , we present in section 2 the general formulation for the dynamical response in size and rotation velocity of discs . in section 3",
    "we examine such effect for several choices of density distribution of dark halo . in section 4",
    "we derive the resulting tfrs and disc size versus magnitude relations . in section 5",
    "we summarize the results of this paper .",
    "detailed derivations of analytic expressions are given in appendix .",
    "in this section , we formulate the dynamical response accompanied by sn feedback to a spiral galaxy consisting of baryons and dark matter .",
    "we consider a thin baryonic disc or the kuzmin disk embedded in an non - rotating spherical dark halo whose density profile is either nfw , homogeneous or @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the thin disc is axisymmetrical and rotation - dominated with negligible velocity dispersions .",
    "note that the density profile of the kuzmin disc is more or less similar to the exponential disc except for the central region .    the gas of low angular momentum in an extended halo collapses towards the galaxy centre on a dynamical timescale and dissipates the energy to cause a burst of star formation in the central region . on the other hand",
    ", the gas of higher angular momentum gradually falls onto a disc plane on a longer timescale and settle on a circular annulus of the disc at the radius according to the value of angular momentum of the gas .",
    "this fallen gas is converted into stars to form a stellar disc .    if the kinetic energy , which is released by sne following the star formation , exceeds the binding energy of the disc , the remaining gas is removed out of the disc .",
    "this disc dynamically recovers a final equilibrium . in general",
    ", the final state could be either a puffed - up disc where velocity dispersions dominate over the rotation , or a thin disc where the rotation remains to dominate with negligible velocity dispersions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", it is enough to consider only the latter , because we are primarily interested in scaling relations in spiral galaxies .",
    "first , we consider that the gas removal occurs after all the material falls in to form the disc . in this case",
    ", the disc achieves a centrifugal equilibrium with the mass @xmath13 and the angular momentum @xmath14 as an initial state .",
    "since the gas removal accompanies the simultaneous losses of mass and angular momentum , the disc should newly recover a centrifugal equilibrium with the mass @xmath15 and the angular momentum @xmath16 as a final state , depending not only on the amount of such losses @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but also on whether the time scale of such losses is longer or shorter than the dynamical scale @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gas removal may well occur while the material is still falling into the disc . in this case",
    ", only a part of the material falls in to form the disc and almost no gas removal occurs afterwards .",
    "the disc would then be settled in centrifugal equilibrium with the mass @xmath15 and the angular momentum @xmath16 throughout from the beginning .",
    "this situation is formally equivalent to the case such that the gas removal occurs on much shorter timescale compared to the dynamical timescale .",
    "therefore , the related formula below in this section could also apply to the situation considered here .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath19 due to rotation , the gravitational self plus interaction potential energy @xmath20 , and the total angular momentum @xmath21 of the kuzmin disc of baryons in a dark halo are given by @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and @xmath26 is the constant dependent on density distribution , @xmath5 is the mass , @xmath27 is the characteristic rotation velocity , and @xmath28 is the characteristic radius .",
    "the subscripts `` @xmath29 '' and `` @xmath30 '' refer to the baryonic and dark matter components , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath31 has a form dependent on density distribution , and the argument @xmath32 is a radius @xmath33 normalized by @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "hereafter , the quantities of baryons with the subscript `` @xmath36 '' in place of `` @xmath29 '' are designated as an initial state before the gas removal , and those with the subscript `` @xmath37 '' as a final state after the gas removal .",
    "note that the quantities of dark matter with the subscript `` @xmath30 '' are assumed not to change throughout the gas removal .",
    "first , we describe the initial state expressing the total energy of the disc as @xmath38 provided that the virial equilibrium @xmath39 holds , and the angular momentum as @xmath40    next , assuming that the disc profile does not change just after the gas removal , we express the total energy as @xmath41 then , conserving this energy , the disc dynamically responds towards recovering a virial equilibrium as the final state : @xmath42 and @xmath43    we here consider an extreme approximation of impulsive mass loss such that the gas removal is faster than the dynamical relaxation . from equations ( [ eq : e - initial ] ) and ( [ eq : e - final ] ) , we express the final quantities in terms of the initial quantities as @xmath44}{2-z_i / z_f } , \\ ] ] and @xmath45^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we consider another extreme approximation of adiabatic mass loss such that the gas removal is slower than the dynamical relaxation .",
    "the total change from the initial to final states is a sum of consecutive infinitesimal changes . substituting @xmath48 and @xmath49 in equation ( [ eq : mfmi - in ] ) and linearizing it",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 where the subscript `` @xmath36 '' is omitted for simplicity .",
    "the first term comes from the self - gravitating baryons alone , and the second term from the gravitational interaction of baryons with dark halo . solving this differential equation , we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is an integration constant or an adiabatic invariant here .",
    "then we express the final quantities in terms of the initial quantities for the adiabatic mass loss : @xmath54 together with the same form of equation ( [ eq : vfvi - in ] ) for the rotation velocity .",
    "it is apparent from equations ( [ eq : mfmi - in ] ) , ( [ eq : vfvi - in ] ) , and ( [ eq : mfmi - ad ] ) that the ratios of dynamical quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are obtained when the ratios of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are given .",
    "in other words , given @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the ratios of @xmath62 and @xmath56 are formally written as a function of @xmath63 : @xmath64 and @xmath65    for the impulsive and adiabatic approximations of mass loss , the change of specific angular momentum is given by @xmath66 from equations ( [ eq : ami ] ) and ( [ eq : amf ] ) .",
    "when the gas removal occurs from the central region of the disc where the mass is concentrated but the rotation velocity is small , @xmath67 should exceed unity .",
    "on the other hand , when the gas removal occurs from the outer region of the disc where the mass is small but the rotation velocity is large , @xmath67 is less than unity",
    ". therefore we use the value of @xmath67 to discuss where in the disc the site of efficient gas removal is located .      in this subsection , before studying more general gas removal , we examine two limiting cases of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    in the baryon dominated case of @xmath68 , we have for the impulsive mass loss @xmath70 and for the adiabatic mass loss @xmath71 the fact that the value of @xmath67 is always larger than unity for the impulsive mass loss suggests that the gas removal should preferentially occurs from the central region of the disc , whereas the fact of @xmath72 for the adiabatic mass loss yields that the same fraction of mass is lost across the disc over its entire radial range .    in the dark matter dominated case of @xmath73 , the disc size and rotation velocity of the initial disc hardly change during the gas removal , because the dominant gravitational potential of dark halo allows almost no response in structure and dynamics of the disc .",
    "in this section , based on the analytic expression of @xmath31 for the kuzmin disc embedded in a dark halo with the nfw , homogeneous , and @xmath74 density distributions , we calculate the strength of dynamical response for @xmath62 , @xmath56 , and @xmath67 as a function of @xmath63 for several combinations of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the range of @xmath60 explored is based on the following consideration .",
    "we assume that all the baryonic matter is distributed in the same way as the dark matter initially and falls in to make up the disc .",
    "then the upper bound of @xmath60 is set by the current estimate of density ratio @xmath77 in the universe .",
    "considering a possibility that not all of the baryonic matter falls into the initial disc , we rather arbitrarily adopt a range of @xmath75 for the initial mass ratio .",
    "the range of @xmath78 is based on the following consideration . from the observed luminosity profile and rotation curve of dwarf spirals ,",
    "the scale radius of dark halo of @xmath79 is estimated as @xmath80kpc , and the corresponding rotation velocity is estimated as @xmath81km@xmath82s@xmath83 @xcite , where @xmath84 is the hubble constant @xmath85 defined as @xmath86km@xmath82s@xmath83mpc@xmath83 . in addition , the radial exponential scalelength of such dwarf spirals is estimated as @xmath87kpc @xcite , thus giving the scale ratio of @xmath88 as observed in the local universe . regarding this ratio",
    "as obtained after the initial disc expands by a factor of several due to the gas removal ( see below ) , we adopt a range of @xmath76 for the initial scale ratio .",
    "we examine the dynamical response to the kuzmin disc embedded in the nfw halo .",
    "the surface mass density distribution of the kuzmin disc is given by @xmath89 with the gravitational potential @xmath90 as for the nfw halo , the density distribution is given by @xmath91^{-1 } , \\ ] ] with the gravitational potential @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a concentration parameter .",
    "since the essential characteristic length of the nfw halo is @xmath94 instead of @xmath34 , we hereafter define @xmath95 .",
    "figure [ fig : res - nfw - mz ] shows the dependence of dynamical response on @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath96 for the impulsive mass loss in the left column , and for the adiabatic mass loss in the right column . in each of the columns ,",
    "the strength of dynamical response for @xmath62 , @xmath56 , and @xmath67 is shown in order from top to bottom panels as a function of @xmath63 for several combinations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the dynamical response monotonically increases as @xmath63 decreases and asymptotically reaches a constant level at @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , given @xmath63 , the dynamical response is stronger for increasing the ratio of surface mass densities of initial disc and dark halo projected onto the disc plane or @xmath98 .",
    "such a tendency holds irrespective of either the impulsive or adiabatic mass loss .",
    "however , comparing the left and right columns , we find that the dynamical response is greatly suppressed for the adiabatic mass loss , in particular , even by a factor of ten or so within the range of @xmath98 and @xmath99 considered .    figure [ fig : res - nfw - c ] shows the dependence of dynamical response on @xmath93 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "there is a tendency such that the dynamical response is stronger for increasing @xmath93 , or equivalently decreasing @xmath102 because @xmath103 is fixed here .    the specific angular momentum after the gas removal @xmath104 is always larger than that before the gas removal @xmath105 , which suggests that the gas removal occurs from the central region of the disc where specific angular momentum is small",
    "this is the condition that the disc should remain thin and rotation dominated before and after the gas removal .",
    "we examine how the kuzmin disc responds depending on the density distribution of dark halo . here",
    "we consider the homogeneous and @xmath74 density distributions in a spherical halo truncated at @xmath106 : @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively , where @xmath109 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the results for these two distributions are shown in figures [ fig : res - homo ] and [ fig : res-1r ] , respectively .",
    "we see from these figures that , given @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the dynamical response for the homogeneous density distribution is stronger than that for the @xmath74 density distribution with which dark matter is more confined inside the characteristic radius of the initial disc @xmath110 .",
    "we also see that , given @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the dynamical response for the nfw halo ( figure [ fig : res - nfw - mz ] ) is even stronger than those considered here .",
    "this is because , adopting @xmath96 in the definition of @xmath103 , the nfw halo is more extended beyond the truncation radius @xmath34 , thereby dark matter is less confined inside the initial disc radius @xmath110 as far as the value of @xmath60 is fixed .    furthermore , the dynamical response for the impulsive mass loss is much stronger than that for the adiabatic mass loss , which is also the case of the nfw halo ( figures [ fig : res - nfw - mz ] and [ fig : res - nfw - c ] ) .",
    "it is instructive here to additionally examine the dynamical response of an exponential disc for which the surface mass density distribution is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the scale length of the disc .",
    "this choice of @xmath113 , which allows no analytic expression of @xmath20 , is known to be more appropriate to spiral galaxies than the kuzmin disc .",
    "for the purpose of comparison , we equate the effective radius of the exponential disc to that of the kuzmin disc , or @xmath114 . then , the dynamical response of the exponential disc embedded in the nfw halo is calculated by numerically integrating @xmath20 , and the result is shown in figure [ fig : exp ] in the same way as in figure [ fig : res - nfw - mz ] .",
    "it is evident from these figures that , given @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the dynamical response of the exponential disc is only slightly stronger than that of the kuzmin disc .",
    "namely , the difference is very small for the impulsive mass loss and is much smaller for the adiabatic mass loss .",
    "this is understood , because the kuzmin disc is more or less similar to the exponential disc except for the central region .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we use the kuzmin disc in section 4 for the study of dynamical response in spiral galaxies over a full range of magnitude observed .",
    "in this section , using the kuzmin disc , we investigate the effects of dynamical response in predicting the rotation velocity versus magnitude relation ( tfr ) and the disc size versus magnitude relation .",
    "we begin with the assumption that dark matter haloes in the cdm universe obey the scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath115 the baryonic matter in an individual halo falls in to form the galaxy disc and a part of such fallen gas goes back to the halo region owing to the gas removal induced by sne in the disc .",
    "cosmological @xmath7-body / sph simulations have shown that along this scheme of galaxy formation the above scaling relations of dark matter haloes almost hold in bright spiral galaxies where the effect of sn feedback is minimal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , in this paper , we assume that initial discs before the gas removal obey the same scaling relations as dark matter haloes , instead of entering into detailed discussions of physical processes involved .",
    "this assumption accords with our use of @xmath116 and @xmath78 as constant parameters , yielding @xmath117 where the subscript `` @xmath36 '' stands for the quantities of initial discs before the gas removal as in previous section .",
    "next , we express the quantities of final discs after the gas removal , to which the subscript `` @xmath37 '' is attached . considering that disc mass is a sum of remaining gas and stars @xmath118 before the gas removal and is left with stars @xmath119 after the gas removal , and introducing the strength parameter for sn feedback @xmath120 for which @xmath121 for massive and normal galaxies and @xmath122 for dwarf galaxies , we obtain @xmath123 following the definition in equation ( 10 ) of @xcite",
    ", we set @xmath124 where @xmath125 is an effective sn - feedback strength in units of velocity , and @xmath126 is a constant power index .    our analysis below confines to the nfw halo , because the homogeneous and @xmath74 density distributions are of academic interest only .",
    "values of the parameters used are @xmath127km@xmath82s@xmath83 and @xmath128 and 4 for the sn - feedback strength , while @xmath100 and @xmath101 , 0.1 , and 0.2 for the initial disc .",
    "theoretical tfr or the @xmath129 relation is obtained by a set of the following equations : @xmath130 and @xmath131 &      { \\rm ( with~ response ) } , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is given in equation ( [ rel : vfvi ] ) .",
    "this relation is compared with the data of rotation velocity @xmath133 and absolute magnitude @xmath134 of spiral galaxies in the i band taken from the table of @xcite , and the results are shown in figure [ fig : tfr - nfw - alpha2 ] for @xmath128 and in figure [ fig : tfr - nfw - alpha4 ] for @xmath135 , together with the data . in each of these figures",
    "the left and right panels are for the impulsive and adiabatic mass losses , respectively .    here , assuming a constant baryonic mass to i - band light ratio @xmath136 and equating @xmath137 to the observed rotation velocity @xmath133 for bright galaxies , we have set the power index @xmath138 in equation ( [ eq : sn - mimf ] ) by adjusting the @xmath129 relation along the horizontal axis in figures [ fig : tfr - nfw - alpha2 ] and [ fig : tfr - nfw - alpha4 ] to fit to the observed tfr in the bright end .",
    "our setting of @xmath138 is consistent with the scaling relation of dark haloes obtained by @xmath7-body cdm simulations @xcite as well as the scaling relation of spiral galaxies obtained by @xmath7-body / sph cdm simulations @xcite .",
    "we see from these figures that the @xmath129 relations with no dynamical response and with no dark halo deviate significantly from the faint data , while the dynamical response with dark halo improves the fit to the data .",
    "in particular , the @xmath129 relations that well agree with the data over the full range of @xmath134 observed are those of @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the impulsive mass loss , and those of @xmath141 and @xmath128 as well as @xmath139 and @xmath135 for the adiabatic mass loss .",

    "so far we have used the characteristic radius @xmath33 to represent the disc size .",
    "however , we hereafter use the effective radius @xmath149 of the kuzmin disc to be consistent with the usual observational definition .    this relation",
    "is then compared with the data of effective disc radius @xmath150 and absolute magnitude @xmath151 of spiral galaxies in the b band taken from the table of @xcite , and the results are shown in figure [ fig : mr - alpha2 ] for @xmath128 and in figure [ fig : mr - alpha4 ] for @xmath135 , together with the data . in each of these figures",
    "the left and right panels are for the impulsive and adiabatic mass losses , respectively .    in order to avoid any systematics arising from our use of the velocity data in the i band and the size data in the b band",
    ", we first transform the theoretical relation from the i band to the b band by applying the empirical formula @xmath152 , then we compare it with the data of @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the b band .",
    "such a transformation formula is obtained by eliminating @xmath133 from the observed tfrs in the b and i bands @xcite , and gives b@xmath153i@xmath154 for dwarf galaxies with @xmath155 , and b@xmath153i@xmath156 for bright galaxies with @xmath157 .",

    "applying the above transformation formula and allowing a small , constant offset of @xmath163b@xmath164i@xmath165 between the effective radii in the b and i bands , we have set the power index @xmath166 in equation ( [ eq : sn - mimf2 ] ) by adjusting the @xmath142 relation along the horizontal and vertical axes in figures [ fig : mr - alpha2 ] and [ fig : mr - alpha4 ] to fit to the observed disc size versus magnitude relation in the bright end .",
    "our setting of @xmath166 is consistent with the scaling relation of dark haloes predicted by a power - law spectrum of initial density fluctuations with an index @xmath167 which is a reasonable approximation to the cdm spectrum on galaxy scales @xcite .",
    "we find that the @xmath142 relation is much more sensitive to the parameters than the @xmath129 relation , and many of the predicted relations can not reproduce the faint data at all . in particular , all the relations considered for the impulsive mass loss should be rejected by the data .",
    "on the other hand , for the adiabatic mass loss , the relations of @xmath141 and @xmath128 agree with the data over the full range of @xmath151 observed , and the relation of @xmath139 and @xmath135 agrees with the data brighter than @xmath168 only .",
    "current sa models , where the mass loss from individual galaxies by sn feedback is taken into account without considering dynamical response , are known to overpredict the rotation velocity of dwarf spiral galaxies ( thick solid lines in figures [ fig : tfr - nfw - alpha2 ] and [ fig : tfr - nfw - alpha4 ] ) and at the same time underpredict their disc size ( thick solid lines in figures [ fig : mr - alpha2 ] and [ fig : mr - alpha4 ] ) .",
    "we could easily imagine that such discrepancies are resolved by the dynamical response of a virialized system associated with weakening of the gravitational potential , most likely owing to the mass loss that we consider in this paper .",
    "in fact , there exist several solutions with dynamical response that account for the observed relation between rotation velocity and absolute i - magnitude ( subsection 4.1 ) and the observed relation between disc size and absolute b - magnitude ( subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "however , these two relations can only be reproduced simultaneously in a limited range of parameter space for the adiabatic mass loss , namely @xmath100 and @xmath141 .",
    "for the sn feedback , the weak case of @xmath169 is preferable to the strong case of @xmath170 .",
    "such an almost unique solution with @xmath169 for the adiabatic mass loss gives the final ratio of @xmath171 for dwarf galaxies .",
    "this value of @xmath172 agrees with observations in the local universe ( see section . [",
    "sec : response ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath67 beyond unity suggests that the mass loss does not accompany the loss of angular momentum .",
    "the results above are obtained for dark haloes with a concentration parameter of @xmath96 , but it is known that @xmath93 is predicted to vary from 10 for large haloes to significantly larger values of @xmath173 for small haloes @xcite .",
    "it is then worth examining this dependence with other parameters fixed .",
    "the results by varying @xmath93 for the tully - fisher relation and the disk size versus magnitude relation are shown in figures [ fig : tfr - alpha2-c ] and [ fig : mr - alpha2-c ] , respectively .",
    "as seen from these figures , contrary to the case of impulsive mass loss , the variation in @xmath93 does not make much difference in the results for the adiabatic mass loss , which validates our conclusion in favor of adiabatic mass loss , irrespective of concentration of the mass included in dark haloes .",
    "the angular momentum distribution in dark haloes is well established theoretically based on the cdm model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is natural to assume that the baryonic components acquire the same amount of specific angular momentum as that of their host haloes , because the cosmic tidal field provides the angular momentum to dark matter and baryons in the same manner @xcite .",
    "this assumption has been a basis of most theories of galaxy formation .    from observations of dwarf spiral galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that their mean ( or _ total _ ) specific angular momenta are very similar to those of their host haloes predicted by those theories .",
    "moreover they found that the the disc to halo mass ratio is smaller than the baryon fraction in the universe .",
    "this means that only a part of baryons forms discs whereas it keeps an amount of specific angular momentum similar to that of host haloes .",
    "they also examined the specific angular momentum distribution in individual haloes , and surprisingly found that it is inconsistent with theoretical prediction by @xcite based on high - resolution @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "secondly , the observed surface density distribution of dwarf spiral galaxies is described as an exponential distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , different from that expected from the cdm model which provides much more centrally concentrated discs when compared with the exponential distribution .",
    "this can not be solved even if sn feedback is simply considered @xcite .",
    "one possible solution to the above discrepancies should be obtained by considering the mass loss from the central region of discs , where the gas should have the specific angular momentum lower than that in the outer region .",
    "sn feedback driving the mass loss without the loss of angular momentum leads discs to increasing their specific angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath174 .",
    "this situation is consistent with that considered in this paper , as shown in the previous section .",
    "so far we have assumed rotation - dominated discs throughout gas removal . with this assumption",
    ", the specific angular momentum always increases after the mass loss , yielding @xmath174 . on the other hand , the transformation of rotation - dominated discs to velocity dispersion - dominated discs , which is the puff - up transformation , leads discs to decreasing the specific angular momentum , yielding @xmath175 @xcite",
    "this situation should occur when the gas in the outer region is removed where the specific angular momentum is large .",
    "such a way of gas removal would be caused by the tidal stripping in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed that this mechanism should be of lenticular galaxy formation .",
    "if so , the fraction of s0 galaxies in clusters will be higher than in fields , and the rotation velocity of dwarf galaxies in clusters will be systematically lower than that in fields .",
    "this should be observationally clarified in future .",
    "we have assumed three types of density profiles of dark haloes , such as the nfw profile with an inner slope of -1 and an outer slope of -3 ( equation [ eq : density - nfw ] ) , and two power - law profiles with a slope of 0 ( homogeneous ) and -1 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the nfw profile is suggested by @xmath7-body simulations , and many authors claim that the inner slope will become even steeper after the condensation of baryons owing to the cooling @xcite , which is called as the adiabatic contraction ( but see @xcite for the effects of random motions ) .",
    "in fact , this implicitly assumes that the cooling timescale is longer than the relaxation timescale for dark haloes to settle into the nfw profile , that is , baryons cool and shrink after virialisation . on galaxy scales",
    ", however , this would not be the case .",
    "the cooling timescale is much shorter than the dynamical timescale , and the relaxation timescale is similar to or longer than the dynamical timescale .",
    "thus it is not unnatural to assume that a mixture of dark matter and cooled baryons virializes . in this case",
    ", there would be galaxy discs within dark haloes with the nfw profile , without undergoing the adiabatic contraction .",
    "this might be an opposite limiting case to the adiabatic contraction , but recent x - ray observation of the intracluster medium has found that there is no evidence of contraction of the dark halo @xcite . since the central cd galaxy is massive enough to suppress the sn feedback , we do not need to expect the expansion due to dynamical response to sn - induced gas removal .",
    "thus it is possible to say that a simple assumption of adiabatic contraction does not work in reality .",
    "this should justify our use of the nfw profile for dark haloes that surround galaxy discs .",
    "to clarify this , of course , high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations including the gas cooling processes are required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in section 4 , our results of dynamical response to sn - induced gas removal within dark haloes",
    "are applied to scaling relations for galaxies , under the assumption that simple scalings among mass , velocity , and size of baryonic components have been set up _ before _ the gas removal .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that these are inferred from observations of scaling relations for massive galaxies where sn feedback is not effective owing to their deep gravitational potential wells .",
    "this seems to be somewhat in contrast to the approach of , for example , @xcite , in which the direction of angular momentum vector is assumed to be invariant .",
    "however , it has been shown that the direction can be moved by contiguous accretion of dark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not assured that the specific angular momentum of discs is similar to that of host haloes averaged over whole regions .",
    "we thus believe that it is reasonable to use the scaling relations for massive galaxies as the initial state for the dynamical response to gas removal ,",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical response to sn - induced gas removal on rotation velocity and disc size of spiral galaxies , explicitly taking into account the underlying gravitational potential wells made by dark matter .",
    "this is an extension of @xcite in which spherical galaxies were considered , but for thin discs in spherical dark haloes to describe spiral galaxies realistically .",
    "similarly , expansion of discs decreases their rotation velocity and increases their size owing to the dynamical response to gas removal even within dark haloes . as shown in section 3 , the dynamical response provides unavoidable effects on the evolution of spiral galaxies , particularly on dwarf spiral galaxies because of their shallow gravitational potential wells .",
    "we have examined the effects of dynamical response on scaling relations among mass , rotation velocity , and disc size of spiral galaxies . since it is complicated to make such relations within a framework of hierarchical formation scenario of galaxies as discussed in section 6 , we use scaling relations which massive galaxies satisfy as the initial state before the gas removal .",
    "the sn - induced gas removal decreases the mass particularly of dwarf galaxies , thus distorting their scaling relations significantly .",
    "such a distortion in the tfr as well as the disc size versus magnitude relation has been pointed out by many papers working on sa models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the dynamical response on spiral galaxies is not taken into account .",
    "we have shown that the dynamical response considered in this paper is able to reproduce the scaling relations as observed .",
    "the hierarchical clustering scenario provides complicated galaxy formation processes .",
    "there are many physical processes such as radiative gas cooling , star formation and sn feedback , within merging dark haloes .",
    "furthermore , while the gas removal occurs mostly due to sn feedback in massive galaxies , other processes including photoheating by the uv background may unlikely scale the same way in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the formation history is also complicated .",
    "for example , discs accrete the gas which is once expelled from galaxies .",
    "it means that discs get bigger even after the dynamical response has exerted upon them .",
    "then , luminous discs tend to cause large extinction by dust , which would bend the tfr .",
    "to investigate the observed properties of galaxies , therefore , we need to fully incorporate the effects of dynamical response into realistic models of galaxy formation like our sa models .",
    "we will study the physical origin of scaling relations including the tfr in more realistic situations in a forthcoming paper .",
