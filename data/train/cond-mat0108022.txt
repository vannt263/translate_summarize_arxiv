    "nonequilibrium systems may be defined as systems evolving according to dynamics that are not constructed from any detailed balance condition . thus their steady states are not described by gibbs - boltzmann statistical mechanics . in particular , such a steady state is characterised by nonvanishing currents of probability between configurations .",
    "these nonequilibrium steady states have been the subject of much attention for some years now and their properties are of fundamental interest @xcite .",
    "for example , generic long - range correlations and nonequilibrium phase transitions , even in one dimension , may be exhibited @xcite ; such behaviour is in contrast to that of equilibrium steady states .",
    "one class of nonequilibrium systems are driven diffusive systems ( dds ) . as well as",
    "probability currents existing these systems also have a mass current of a conserved quantity driven through the system .",
    "dds lend themselves to the modelling of a variety of phenomena such as super - ionic conductors , traffic flow and biophysical transport problems @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest dds is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) . here",
    "particles hop in a preferred direction on a one - dimensional lattice with hard - core exclusion ( at most one particle can be at any given site ) .",
    "the open system where particles are injected and extracted at the boundaries was first studied by krug@xcite and boundary - induced phase transitions shown to be possible . since then our understanding of phase transitions in one - dimensional dds has deepened through exact solutions of this model being worked out @xcite@xcite and further examples being studied .",
    "of particular interest have been phase transitions manifesting spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , phase transitions and phase separation induced by defect particles or defect sites @xcite , phase separation in multicomponent systems @xcite and further examples of boundary - induced phase transitions @xcite . clearly",
    "the presence of conserved quantities and a drive , leading to non - zero current @xmath2 is crucial to all these phase transitions .",
    "exact results have provided us with a particularly good understanding of the asep with open boundary conditions .",
    "let us summarise some of the results here .",
    "the open system is defined on a lattice of @xmath3 sites where at the left boundary a particle is introduced with rate @xmath4 if that site is empty , and at the right boundary site any particle present is removed with rate @xmath5 .",
    "these boundary conditions force a steady state current of particles @xmath6 through the system .",
    "phase transitions occur when the current in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath7 , exhibits non - analyticities .",
    "the steady state of this system was solved exactly first for the totally asymmetric hopping case @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram comprises three phases : a high - density phase where the system is controlled by the low exit rate @xmath5 ( @xmath8 , the current takes the value @xmath9 and the bulk density is @xmath10 ; a low - density phase where the system is controlled by a low injection rate @xmath4 ( @xmath11 ) , the current is @xmath12 and the bulk density is @xmath13 ; a maximal - current phase where both @xmath14 and the current is @xmath15 and the bulk density @xmath16 .",
    "the exact solution has been generalised to partially asymmetric hopping and retains the same three generic phases @xcite .",
    "indeed , the qualitative phase diagram appears robust for one - dimensional , open , driven systems @xcite .",
    "the phase transitions from the high density or low density phases to the maximal - current phase are both _",
    "continuous_the density is continuous at the transition but has a discontinuity in its first derivative and the current has a discontinuity in its second derivative .",
    "however the transition from the high density to the low density phase is _ discontinuous_the density is discontinuous and",
    "the current has a discontinuity in its first derivative at the transition . on the coexistence line between the high and low density phases the system consists of a low density region adjacent to the left boundary and a high density region adjacent to the right boundary .",
    "the currents within the two domains are equal ( otherwise one phase would be driven out of the system ) and domains are separated by a shock , i.e. a sharp domain wall that performs diffusive motion due to fluctuations in the number of particles entering and leaving the system @xcite .",
    "the above observations suggest an analogy between the role of the current for a driven system and the role of the chemical potential in an equilibrium system .",
    "that is , whereas in equilibrium the condition for phase coexistence is that the chemical potential of the two phases must be equal , in the present case one must have that the currents in the two phases are equal .",
    "indeed , the exact solution @xcite revealed that the current is expressed as the ratio of partition sums for systems of size @xmath17 and @xmath3 yielding an explicit identification of @xmath2 as a fugacity ( i.e. the exponential of a chemical potential ) .    a further kind of boundary - induced phase transition , manifesting spontaneous symmetry breaking , is found when the model is generalised to two oppositely moving species of particle : one species is injected at the left , moves rightwards and exits at the right ; the other species is injected at the right , moves leftwards and exits at the left @xcite .",
    "intuitively one can picture the system as a narrow road bridge : cars moving in opposite directions can pass each other but can not occupy the same space .",
    "the model has a left - right symmetry when the injection rates and exit rates for the two species of particles are symmetric .",
    "however for low exit rates ( @xmath5 ) this symmetry is broken and the lattice is dominated by one of the species at any given time .",
    "this implies that the short time averages of currents and bulk densities of the two species of particles are no longer equal . over longer times",
    "the system flips between the two symmetry - related states . in the @xmath18",
    "limit the mean flip time between the two states has been calculated analytically and shown to diverge exponentially with system size @xcite .",
    "thus the ` bridge ' model provided a first example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a one dimensional system .    of particular interest",
    "is the transition from the low @xmath5 regime where the symmetry is broken to the high @xmath5 regime where the steady state is symmetric .",
    "a mean - field theory @xcite(to be reviewed in section  [ mft ] ) predicts the following scenario in terms of the phases of the single species model . for low @xmath5 one species of particles ( the dominant one )",
    "is in a high density phase whereas the other is in a low density phase .",
    "this will be referred to as the _ hd / ld _ phase .",
    "as @xmath5 is increased a discontinuous transition occurs to another asymmetric phase where both particles are in single species low density phases ( _ ld / ld _ phase ) i.e. the density of each species is less than 1/2 but the densities are different . as @xmath5 is increased further a continuous transition occurs to a symmetric phase wherein the species have the same density with value less than 1/2 ( _ ld _ phase ) .",
    "thus , in this scenario , there is a sequence of _ two _ transitions with the _ ld / ld _ phase appearing as the intermediate phase .",
    "the intermediate phase occupies a very narrow region of the mean field phase diagram , nevertheless in @xcite , monte carlo simulations provided some evidence supporting its existence .",
    "however , arndt _ et al _ @xcite have argued on the basis of numerical studies that there is a _ single _ discontinuous transition and that the _ ld / ld _ phase does not exist . in order to draw their conclusions arndt _",
    "et al _ used the concept of a nonequilibrium free energy .",
    "this simply involves calculating the probability distribution of the particle densities in the steady state .",
    "et al _ then converted this into a ` free energy density ' as a function of particle densities by taking the logarithm of the distribution and dividing by @xmath3 .    in order to clarify the discrepancy between the results of @xcite and @xcite we further investigate in this work the transition from the asymmetric state to the symmetric state .",
    "we present extensive numerical studies and theoretical arguments that suggest that the intermediate _",
    "ld / ld _ phase does indeed exist .",
    "however , our numerics indicate that the sequence of transitions is distinct from both the mean - field prediction and the scenario proposed in @xcite . instead",
    ", we observe a third scenario in which as @xmath5 is increased a discontinuous transition occurs from the _ hd / ld _ to the _ ld / ld _ phase , then a further discontinuous transition occurs from the _ ld / ld _ to the symmetric phase .    the two first order transitions displayed by this model are found to be of a different nature .",
    "in the transition between the _ hd / ld _ and the _ ld / ld _ phases , the two phases have the same currents , and thus they may _ coexist _ in the same system with one fraction of the system occupied by one phase and the rest of the system by the other . this is closely analogous to ordinary first order transitions in equilibrium where the phases involved in the transition have the same chemical potential . on the other hand the first order transition from the asymmetric _",
    "ld / ld _ to the symmetric phase is found to be of a different nature , which has no equilibrium analogue . here",
    "the currents of the two phases are not equal to each other and thus the two phases can not coexist in the same system for a long time .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we define the model and review the mean - field theory . in section  3 our numerical simulations are presented , in particular we provide numerical evidence for two discontinuous transitions . in section  4",
    "we discuss a simplistic ` blockage ' picture that captures some features of the simulations . in section  5",
    "we conclude and resolve the discrepancies between our conclusions and those of @xcite .",
    "we now define the bridge model described in the introduction .",
    "we indicate the presence of a hole by ` 0 ' , and of a positive or negative particle by ` @xmath19 ' and ` @xmath20 ' respectively .",
    "the site is denoted by an index .",
    "the possible configuration changes that may occur in time @xmath21 can be described as follows :    left end : @xmath22 ( -)_1 \\to ( 0)_1 & \\mbox{with probability } & \\beta \\ ; \\mbox{d}t \\end{array}\\label{left}\\ ] ] right end : @xmath23 ( + ) _",

    "we will consider only the case @xmath26 .",
    "here we review the mean - field theory and associated phases @xcite . the mean - field theory is implemented by approximating two - point correlation functions by products of one - point correlations functions .",
    "let @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) denote the average positive ( negative ) particle density at site @xmath29",
    ". in a stationary state , the positive ( negative ) particle currents @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) through the system are site independent and satisfy , in the mean - field theory , @xmath32 for the bulk ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath33 for the boundaries .",
    "we will denote the limiting bulk densities far away from the boundaries as @xmath34 so that in the limit of large @xmath3 @xmath35    notice that the two systems of particles are only coupled by the boundary conditions ( [ jp_boundary],[jm_boundary ] ) .",
    "the mean - field theory solves for the currents through the definition of effective boundary rates @xmath36 then the equations for the currents of each species can be solved self - consistently by using the solutions of the mean - field theory for the single species model @xcite .",
    "depending on the feeding and output rates @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( superscript `` s '' denoting the single species quantities ) there exist three different phases in the single species model :    * the maximal - current or power - law phase with current @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "there is a continuous transition to the _ ld _ symmetric phase at @xmath70    thus , as we increase @xmath5 from zero the mean - field theory predicts the following sequence of transitions : at @xmath71 a discontinuous transition from _ hd / ld _ to _ ld / ld _ ; at @xmath72 a continuous transition from the _ ld / ld _ asymmetric to the low - density symmetric phase ; at @xmath73 a continuous transition from the _ ld _ phase to the maximal current phase .",

    "quantitatively , the values differ from the mean - field results which predict the transition from the _ hd / ld _ to the _ ld / ld _ for @xmath80 and the transition to the symmetric phase for @xmath70 .     as a function of the particle densities",

    "1 @xmath87 and the system is in the _ hd / ld _ phase .",
    "the probability distribution shows two well - separated peaks at @xmath88 and @xmath89 which correspond to the densities @xmath90 and @xmath91 predicted by mean - field theory in section [ mft ] .",
    "a transition occurs at @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ transition ] ) .",
    "one observes the ` boomerang ' shape described by arndt _ et al _ : in the two arms of the boomerang of the probability distribution the density of one particle type is constant and the density of the other fluctuates strongly .",
    "this behaviour corresponds to coexistence of the _ hd / ld _ and _ ld / ld _ phases in the same system with a wandering domain wall or shock that is equally likely to be at any position separating the regions of different density .",
    "however , there is a clear saddle point separating the two arms of the boomerang .",
    "this is in contrast to the first order transition proposed by arndt _",
    "in which @xmath74 is supposed to be constant along the whole structure . at @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we observe evidence for a _ ld / ld _ asymmetric phase .",
    "the probability distribution shows two peaks at values which are @xmath94 for both @xmath75 and @xmath76 confirming the existence of a _",
    "ld / ld _ asymmetric phase .",
    "however note that the saddle point separating the two peaks itself has a high probability .",
    "when @xmath5 is increased to 0.284 ( fig .",
    "4 ) the probability appears to have a flat top indicating that one is at the transition to the symmetric phase .",
    "finally , for @xmath95 the system is in the symmetric phase with @xmath96 .",
    "the maxima in the probability distribution , corresponding to a second symmetry broken phase , are clearly visible for @xmath93 , but there remain some questions about the nature of this _ ld / ld _ phase .",
    "first of all , the location of the peaks is not correctly described by mean - field theory ; the minority density is @xmath97 as for the _ hd / ld _ phase , but the majority species is found to be present with density @xmath98 which does not agree with the mean - field value .",
    "furthermore , it is striking that the maxima are not only separated by a very high saddle , but also have long tails in the _ hd / ld _ region of the distribution that are a vestige of the transition from the _ hd / ld _ phase ( fig .  2 ) .    to gain a deeper understanding of these features , we explicitly illustrate the time evolution of the densities at @xmath99 close to the transition from the _ hd / ld _ phase ( figs .",
    "the sequence shows different periods of a single simulation run .",
    "the positive and negative particle densities @xmath75 and @xmath76 and their difference are plotted .",
    "different types of behaviour are clearly observed as time evolves . in fig .",
    "6 the simulation begins with densities corresponding to the arm of the boomerang : the density of the majority phase fluctuates strongly , while that of the minority phase is relatively constant . in fig .",
    "7 the simulation moves into a short period of symmetric densities corresponding to the _ ld _ phase then progresses to a symmetry broken period corresponding to the _ ld / ld _ phase .",
    "finally figure  [ oscil ] illustrates curious oscillations in the densities about the symmetric value that can sometimes be observed .",
    "thus in the _ ld / ld _ region there appear to be different behaviours competing for the true phase behaviour .",
    "one might expect this to be a finite size effect and that for @xmath100 one behaviour dominates .",
    "we will provide evidence for this below .",
    "another consequence of competing behaviours is that they do not coexist in a system , rather the system switches from one behaviour to another .",
    "this implies that although the transition to from the _ ld / ld _ phase to the symmetric is discontinous there is no coexistence between the phases .",
    "this is in contrast to the discontinous transition from the _ hd / ld _ to the _ ld / ld _ phase where there is coexistence .",
    "one can also rule out coexistence at the _ ld / ld _ to symmetric phase transition on theoretical grounds : it is not possible for a phase with symmetric currents to coexist with a phase with asymmetric currents in the same system .",
    "curiously , although coexistence does not occur , figure  [ beta_0284 ] , appears to have a flat - topped distribution .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether this is just a finite size effect .",
    "we defer the introduction of a more intuitive description than mean - field theory , which will explain some of the findings described above , to the next section .",
    "we first have a closer look at how the behaviour near the transitions changes with increasing system size .",
    "to provide a more convenient two - dimensional representation of @xmath74 , we will plot in the following the maximum of @xmath74 as seen along diagonals satifying @xmath101 . as the probability distribution is symmetric around the @xmath102 ,",
    "it is sufficient to restrict the plot to @xmath103 .    for increasing system size @xmath3 , the peaks corresponding to a _",
    "ld / ld _ asymmetric region become more pronounced as is shown in figure [ ld_phase ] for system sizes of @xmath104@xmath105 and for an exit rate @xmath106 . to quantify the sharpening of the peaks we plot the ratio of the height of the peak to the height of saddle    in figure [ peak_saddle ] .",
    "although the increase is slow , it is monotonic and can be fitted by a power law ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this indicates that the peaks corresponding to a _",
    "ld _ phase should dominate the probability distribution in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "figure  [ peak_saddle ] thus provides strong evidence that the _ ld / ld _ phase does truly exist .",
    "however , one should note that the power - law scaling of the peak to saddle ratio is unusual  within an equilibrium free energy picture ( where @xmath108 ) one would expect the ratio to scale exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "conversely the power - law scaling implies that the escape time or flip time from the _ ld / ld _ phase does not increase exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "we will return to this point in the conclusion .",
    "in the previous section the simulations provided evidence for a _ ld / ld _ asymmetric phase but with values of the densities different from those predicted by mean - field theory .",
    "we also saw coexistence between the _ hd / ld _ and _ ld / ld _ phases at the transition .    here",
    "we draw on the simulations to give a more intuitive description of the _ ld / ld _ phase that we will refer to as the blockage picture .",
    "this picture builds on observations of @xcite and @xcite , the exact results for @xmath109 @xcite and general theoretical considerations of @xcite .",
    "first we sketch the qualitative features of the _ hd / ld _ phase as predicted by mean - field theory and confirmed by the exact results for @xmath109 .",
    "schematically the instantaneous picture is as in fig .  [ asym_dens ]  a ) : the bulk of the lattice is occupied by a blockage of positive particles . in the figure",
    "@xmath110 denotes the density of the majority species ( travelling from left to right ) in the blockage and @xmath111 denotes the density to the left of the blockage ( the upper index ` bp ' denotes blockage picture ) .",
    "similarly @xmath112 denotes the density of the minority species near the left boundary and @xmath113 denotes the density away from the left boundary . near the left boundary there is a small blockage of negative particles .",
    "this blockage is unstable in the sense that the domain wall between it and the bulk region drifts to the left . averaging over the positions of the domain wall results in the exponential decay of the mean field density profile from the left boundary @xcite .",
    "now we summarise some important features of the _ ld / ld _ phase that we have observed in simulations .",
    "the simulations show that small blockages are formed by the majority species at its output end .",
    "this prevents the other particle species from entering and leads to the symmetry breaking .",
    "however for finite size systems these blockages are not stable for long times ( at least not for times exponential in the system size ) which contrasts with the _ hd / ld _ phase .",
    "these observations lead us to the following blockage picture for the _ ld / ld _ phase as illustrated in figure  [ asym_dens ]  b ) .",
    "there is a small blockage of positive particles at the right end of the system .",
    "thus the domain wall of figure  [ asym_dens ]  a ) is now pushed to the right end of the system . in order to obtain the currents and the densities in the _ ld / ld _ phase we assume that the blockage of the majority species is stable in the sense that the current into the blockage equals the current out .",
    "we also assume that the the densities of both species are basically constant within each domain .",
    "this is backed up by our numerical results .",
    "this assumption of a stable blockage and constant density at the output side of the majority species implies using the mean - field equations ( [ jp_bulk][jm_boundary ] ) that @xmath114 thus @xmath115 since the current into the blockage is equal to the current out one obtains @xmath116 the blockage also controls the input of the minority species and we can determine @xmath113 from the condition @xmath117 and one finds @xmath118 note that these results for the bulk densities ( [ llrhop],[llrhom ] ) differ from the mean - field theory predictions ( [ pmft],[mmft ] ) . also observe that ( [ jpbp],[llrhom ] ) are the same as the corresponding mean - field expressions for the _ hd / ld _ phase ( [ mfdensity ] ) .",
    "thus one can think of the blockage picture as being an extension of the mean - field theory into the _",
    "ld / ld _ regime .",
    "finally observe that the majority and minority densities given by the blockage picture for the _ ld / ld _ phase do not coincide ( except at @xmath119 or 0 ) thus the blockage picture is consistent with a discontinuous transition to the symmetric phase at some lower value of @xmath5 .",
    "to summarise , in the case of the _ hd / ld _ phase the blockage occupies the bulk of the system , the bulk density for the majority species is given by @xmath120 . the bulk density for the minority species",
    "is given by @xmath121 .",
    "at the transition from the _ hd / ld _ to the _ ld / ld _ phase the domain wall may be found anywhere in the system .",
    "this corresponds to a shock , that is a sudden change in density over a microscopic region .",
    "the wandering of the shock produces the arms of the boomerang on the plots of @xmath74 presented in figure  [ transition ] . in the _ ld / ld _",
    "phase the domain wall is localised at the right end of the system .",
    "the bulk densities are given by ( [ llrhop],[llrhom ] ) as @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the blockage picture explains the qualitative features of the phases and predicts quantitatively the densities in the _ ld / ld _ phase .",
    "however , it does not make any further quantitative predictions e.g. for the values of @xmath5 at the transition points . also some features remain unexplained . for example in the _ ld / ld _ phase a stable blockage ( as defined above )",
    "is assumed at the right hand boundary .",
    "for such a blockage , one would expect a diffusive motion of the domain wall leading it to explore the whole system . yet",
    ", this only occurs at the transition from _ hd / ld _ to _ ld / ld _ ; in the _ ld / ld _ phase the blockage is pinned near that boundary .",
    "this suggests that the blockage is only stable over short times",
    ". it would be interesting to understand this more fully .",
    "in this paper we studied a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process for two species which exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular we have made a detailed study of the transition from the symmetry broken regime to the symmetric regime .",
    "we carried out monte carlo simulations to investigate the transition between the previously studied high - density / low density asymmetric phase @xcite and a symmetric phase .",
    "we found evidence for the existence of a second asymmetric phase .",
    "however although the observed particle densities in this region are unequal and both smaller than @xmath42 , they do not correspond to the predictions of the mean - field _",
    "ld / ld _ asymmetric phase .",
    "instead a simplistic description of this phase is provided by the ` blockage picture ' .",
    "it ascribes the symmetry breaking in the two species system to the buildup of blockages at the output end of one particle type due to the low output rate .",
    "these blockages then prevent the other particle species from entering which results in a lower density .",
    "this picture is in accord with mean - field theory for the _ hd / ld _ phase ; it gives new insight into the observed _ ld / ld _ asymmetric phase .",
    "interestingly , although both transitions ( from _ hd / ld _ to _ ld / ld _ and from _ ld / ld _ to symmetric ) are discontinuous , they are of different types . at the first transition one",
    "has coexistence between the _ hd / ld _ and _ ld / ld _ phases .",
    "this is manifested by the presence of a shock in the density of the majority species wandering through the system . at the _ ld / ld _ to symmetric transition , however , one can not have coexistence simply because a phase with symmetric currents of particles can not coexist in the same system with a phase where the currents are not symmetric .",
    "thus we have a discontinous transition without coexistence .      the approach of arndt _",
    "et al_@xcite is to assign a free energy density to the probability distribution of the steady states .",
    "it is defined as the negative logarithm of a probability distribution @xmath124 which depends only on the density difference ( and implicitly on the system size @xmath3 ) : @xmath125 however in that work @xmath124 is calculated by integrating @xmath74 along diagonals satisfying @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath124 therefore does not distinguish between the rather narrow peaks and the lower but wider saddle between them .",
    "considering the logarithm of this function to calculate the free energy will flatten any remaining maxima of @xmath124 in the _ ld / ld _ phase even further .",
    "this explains why arndt _",
    "et al _ concluded the _ ld / ld _ phase was absent . in fig .",
    "[ ld_phase ] , on the other hand , we project @xmath74 onto a two dimensional representation by taking the maximum along the diagonals @xmath126 . for the finite size systems considered",
    "this preserves more faithfully the three dimensional structure of @xmath74 and we clearly see the _ ld / ld _ phase .",
    "finally , we would like to mention the flip time in the asymmetric phases . for finite",
    "system sizes the blockages in the _ ld / ld _ asymmetric phase are only stable for short times implying that the flip time in this asymmetric phase is in turn small . for @xmath5 vanishingly small ( i.e. in the _ hd / ld _ phase )",
    "it is known that the flipping time grows exponentially with @xmath3 @xcite , whereas in the symmetric phase the flipping time increases linearly with @xmath3 . both of these dependences have been confirmed by simulations which we do not present here .",
    "it would be of interest to determine the scaling of the flip time with @xmath3 in the _ ld / ld _ phase . a dependence on @xmath3 distinct from the _ hd / ld _ and symmetric phase would provide further understanding of the _ ld / ld _ phase . in the _ ld / ld _ regime ,",
    "however , the instabilities of the blockages make it difficult to observe distinct non - linear behaviour for system sizes accessible by simulations .",
    "we found instead that the _ ld / ld _ phase is strongly dominated by symmetric behaviour for small systems .",
    "this simply reflects that the maxima of the probability distribution are not very pronounced for the _ ld / ld _ asymmetric phase . a peak - to - saddle ratio of one order of magnitude which should be a threshold for a crossover to such non - linear behaviour corresponds to system sizes several orders of magnitude larger than the ones investigated here .",
    "it remains a numerical challenge to go to such large system sizes .",
