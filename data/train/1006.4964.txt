    "at high - energy colliders such as the @xmath0 collider hera at desy and the @xmath1 collider tevatron at fermilab , diffractive processes are known to constitute an important fraction of all scattering events .",
    "these events are defined experimentally by the presence of a forward - going hadronic system @xmath2 with four - momentum @xmath3 , low mass @xmath4 ( typically a proton that remained intact or a low - lying nucleon resonance ) , small four - momentum transfer @xmath5 , and small longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath6 from the incoming proton with four - momentum @xmath7 to the central hadronic system @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the case of @xmath9 ) .",
    "diffractive scattering process @xmath10 , where the hadronic systems @xmath8 and @xmath2 are separated by the largest rapidity gap in the final state . ]",
    "experimentally a large rapidity gap separates the hadronic system @xmath8 with invariant mass @xmath11 from the final - state system @xmath2 .",
    "theoretically diffractive interactions are described in the framework of regge theory @xcite as the exchange of a trajectory with vacuum quantum numbers , the pomeron ( @xmath12 ) trajectory .",
    "then the object exchanged between the systems @xmath8 and @xmath2 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , is the pomeron ( or additional lower - lying regge poles ) , and the upper vertex of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 , can be interpreted as deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) on the pomeron target for the case that the virtuality of the exchanged photon @xmath15 is sufficiently large . in analogy",
    "to dis on a proton target , @xmath16 , the cross section for the process @xmath17 in the dis region can be expressed as the convolution of partonic cross sections and universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the pomeron .",
    "the partonic cross sections are the same as for @xmath0 dis .",
    "the pomeron pdfs are usually multiplied with vertex functions for the lower vertex in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , yielding the diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) .",
    "the @xmath18 evolution of the dpdfs is calculated with the usual dglap @xcite evolution equations known from @xmath16 dis . except for the @xmath18 evolution",
    ", the dpdfs can not be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd and must be determined from experiment .",
    "such dpdfs @xcite have been obtained from the hera inclusive measurements of the diffractive structure function @xmath19 @xcite , defined in analogy with the proton structure function @xmath20 .",
    "the presence of a hard scale such as the squared photon virtuality @xmath21 in deep - inelastic scattering or a large transverse jet energy @xmath22 in the photon - proton center - of - momentum frame should then allow for calculations of partonic cross sections for the central system @xmath8 using perturbative qcd .",
    "such diffractive processes with the presence of a hard scale are usually called hard diffractive processes .",
    "the central problem in hard diffraction is the problem of qcd factorization , i.e.  the question whether diffractive cross sections are factorisable into universal diffractive parton density functions and partonic cross sections .    for dis processes ,",
    "factorization has indeed been proven to hold @xcite , and dpdfs have been extracted at low and intermediate @xmath18 @xcite from high - precision inclusive measurements of the process @xmath13 using the usual dglap evolution equations .",
    "the proof of the factorization formula , usually referred to as the validity of qcd factorization in hard diffraction , also appears to be valid for the direct part of photoproduction @xmath23 or low-@xmath18 electroproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "however , factorization does not hold for hard processes in diffractive hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the problem is that soft interactions between the ingoing hadrons and their remnants occur in both the initial and final states .",
    "this agrees with experimental measurements at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "predictions of diffractive dijet cross sections for collisions as measured by cdf using dpdfs determined a few years ago @xcite and more recently @xcite by the h1 collaboration at hera overestimate the measured cross section by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this suppression of the cdf cross section can be explained by the rescattering of the two incoming hadron beams which , by creating additional hadrons , destroy the rapidity gap @xcite .",
    "diffractive production of dijets with invariant mass @xmath24 in direct ( left ) and resolved ( right ) photon - pomeron collisions , leading to the production of one or two additional remnant jets.,title=\"fig : \" ] diffractive production of dijets with invariant mass @xmath24 in direct ( left ) and resolved ( right ) photon - pomeron collisions , leading to the production of one or two additional remnant jets.,title=\"fig : \" ]    jet production with real photons involves direct interactions of the photon with quarks or gluons from the proton ( or in our case from the pomeron ) as well as resolved photon contributions , leading to parton - parton interactions and an additional remnant jet coming from the photon as reviewed in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . for the direct interactions",
    ", factorization is expected to be valid as in the case of dis , whereas we expect it to fail for the resolved process as in hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "for this part of photoproduction one would therefore expect a similar suppression factor due to rescattering effects of the ingoing partons . introducing vector - meson dominance photon fluctuations ,",
    "such a suppression by about a factor of three for resolved photoproduction at hera was predicted @xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the first measurements of dijet cross sections in diffractive photoproduction have been presented by the h1 collaboration as contributions to two conferences @xcite .",
    "the kinematic range for these data were @xmath25 gev@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 gev and @xmath30 gev , where jets were identified using the inclusive @xmath31-cluster algorithm .",
    "the measured cross sections as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 were compared to leading - order ( lo ) qcd predictions , using the rapgap monte carlo model @xcite . for the dpdfs the lo ` h1 2002 fit ' was used @xcite .",
    "it was found that these two cross sections were well described by the predictions in normalization and shape over the whole range of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , showing no breakdown of factorization in either the resolved or in the direct photoproduction .",
    "in addition , normalized cross sections as a function of various other variables were compared to the predictions with the result that all measured distributions were in good agreement .",
    "subsequently we calculated the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections for the cross section of diffractive dijet production using the same kinematic cuts and with the same dpdfs as in the first h1 analysis @xcite on the basis of our previous work on nlo corrections for inclusive direct @xcite and resolved @xcite dijet photoproduction .",
    "while at lo good agreement with the h1 data @xcite was found , consistent with the finding in the h1 analysis @xcite , it was found that the nlo corrections increase the cross section significantly @xcite and require a suppression factor of the order of @xmath34 . since on theoretical grounds only a suppression of",
    "the resolved cross section would be acceptable , we demonstrated in @xcite that by multiplying the resolved cross section with a suppression factor of @xmath35 , reasonably good agreement with the preliminary h1 data @xcite could be achieved .",
    "this value for the suppression factor turned out to be in good agreement with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "the first experimental data from the zeus collaboration were presented at the dis workshop in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the dijet cross sections were obtained in the kinematic range @xmath36 gev@xmath26 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 gev . for these kinematic constraints nlo calculations were not available in 2004 .",
    "so , the measurements were compared to lo calculations , unfortunately with previous h1 dpdfs @xcite with the result that good agreement in the shape was achieved . however , the normalization was off by a factor of @xmath40 , which was attributed later to the older dpdf input @xcite , so that the h1 and zeus results were consistent with each other .",
    "the situation concerning the agreement of h1 and zeus data and the influence of nlo corrections improved already considerably in the fall of 2004 . at",
    "the ichep 2004 both collaborations presented their new data and compared them with nlo cross section calculations .",
    "h1 compared their data with the predictions from the program of frixione @xcite and zeus with our calculations along the lines of @xcite , where now only the different kinematic cuts of the zeus analysis had to be incorporated .",
    "both collaborations also used the same dpdfs , namely the ` h1 2002 fit ' @xcite .",
    "the conclusion from the comparison of the respective nlo calculations with the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite measurements were very similar .",
    "both collaborations observed from their data that good agreement was achieved with the global suppression ( of direct and resolved contribution ) by a factor @xmath41 . concerning the model with suppression of the resolved contribution only , the h1 collaboration concluded that this model was disfavored compared to the global suppression model .",
    "this result was obtained by comparing the differential cross sections @xmath42 and @xmath43 to a calculation , in which the partonic cross sections were suppressed for @xmath44 by a factor of @xmath45 . in the zeus contribution to the ichep 2004 , differential cross",
    "sections of several observables had been shown and compared with our calculations .",
    "all five comparisons , namely for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath33 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , showed very good agreement both in shape and normalization of the cross section with the resolved photon suppression ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the only exception was the comparison of @xmath42 , which did not show agreement with the resolved photon suppression only . here",
    "the suppression factor varied as a function of @xmath32 between 0.5 and 0.75 and the description of the shape was better without any suppression , which would signal a global suppression .",
    "we emphasize that at this stage of the analysis at the end of 2004 , both the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations showed that their data were consistent with a global suppression of about a factor of two against the sum of direct and resolved nlo qcd predictions .",
    "in addition , in the h1 contribution @xcite it was claimed explicitly that there was evidence for factorization breaking also in direct photoproduction . in 2005",
    "the zeus collaboration presented a more detailed comparison by dividing their data sample into two subsets , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in order to be more sensitive to the suppression of the direct ( @xmath52 ) and the resolved ( @xmath51 ) components . together with the result of h1",
    "the overall conclusion at the dis 2005 workshop was the same as at the end of 2004 , namely , that good agreement was achieved with the global suppression of @xmath41 , while a suppression of only the resolved contribution at nlo was disfavored by the data @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the zeus data with respect to the samples enriched in direct and resolved processes was continued in a contribution to the uppsala lepton - photon conference in 2005 @xcite . for @xmath53",
    "the nlo predictions gave a good description of the shape of the measured cross section , although the absolute normalization was a factor of two above the data .",
    "for @xmath51 the nlo calculations were again above the data when no suppression ( @xmath54 ) was applied and below the data by a factor of two when a suppression with @xmath55 was applied to the resolved photon processes .",
    "the ratio of the resolved - enriched to the direct - enriched samples was reasonably well reproduced by the nlo predictions with @xmath54 , indicating that a suppression of the resolved sample with respect to the direct sample was not seen in any particular kinematic region .",
    "this agreed with the earlier findings that a uniform suppression for both resolved and direct process gives a better description of the data .",
    "of course , all these conclusions relied on the fact , that the dpdfs as evaluated by h1 @xcite are really the correct ones .",
    "the analysis in @xcite was based on the largest selection of variables so far , namely @xmath56 and @xmath49 .    the conclusions above concerning the global overall suppression versus a suppression in the resolved contribution only based solely on preliminary data from h1 and zeus and the preliminary ` h1 2002 fit ' @xcite for the dpdfs remained also after 2005 until the final publications of the h1 and zeus analysis appeared in 2007 .",
    "the comparison between the final experimental results and the nlo theory used the new and final dpdfs constructed by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "this analysis was based on the larger sample of the years 1997 - 2000 as compared to the previous published pdf sets . in @xcite",
    "two nlo fits , ` h1 2006 fit a ' and ` h1 2006 fit b ' were presented , which both give a good description of inclusive diffraction .",
    "these two sets of pdfs differ mainly in the gluon density at large fractional parton momentum , which is poorly constrained by the inclusive diffractive scattering data , since there is no direct coupling of the photon to gluons , so that the gluon density is constrained only through the evolution .",
    "the gluon density of fit a is peaked at the starting scale at large fractional momentum , whereas the fit b is flat in that region .",
    "the differential cross sections as measured in diffractive photoproduction by h1 @xcite were compared with the nlo predictions obtained with the frixione program @xcite , interfaced to the ` h1 2006 fit b ' dpdfs . in this publication @xcite ,",
    "the conclusions deduced earlier from the comparison with the preliminary data and the preliminary ` h1 2002 fit ' @xcite are fully confirmed , now also with the new dpdf fits @xcite .",
    "in particular , the global suppression is obtained , independent of the dpdf fits used , i.e.  fit a or fit b , by considering the ratio of measured dijet cross section to nlo predictions in photoproduction in relation to the same ratio in dis . in this comparison",
    "the value of the suppression is @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , by using the overall suppression factor 0.5 , h1 obtained a good description of all the measured distributions in the variables @xmath33 , @xmath32 , @xmath47 , @xmath58 , @xmath48 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath24 interfaced with the ` h1 2006 fit b ' dpdfs and taking into account hadronization corrections @xcite .",
    "finally , the h1 collaboration investigated how well the data are describable under the assumption that in the nlo calculation the cross section for @xmath61 is not suppressed . the best agreement in a fit was obtained for a suppression factor 0.44 for the nlo calculation with @xmath44 , based on fitting the distributions for @xmath62 and @xmath48 . in this comparison",
    "they found disagreement for the largest @xmath32-bin and the lowest @xmath63-bin ( which are related ) , but better agreement in the @xmath48-distribution . in @xcite",
    "this leads to the statement , that the assumption that the direct cross section obeys factorization is strongly disfavored by their analysis . in total , it is obvious that in the final h1 analysis @xcite a global suppression in diffractive dijet photoproduction is clearly established .",
    "just recently also the zeus collaboration presented their final result on diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite .",
    "as in their preliminary analysis , the two jets with the highest transverse energies @xmath22 were required to satisfy @xmath64 @xmath39 gev , which is higher than in the h1 analysis with @xmath65 @xmath66 gev @xcite .",
    "zeus compared their measurements with the nlo predictions for diffractive photoproduction of dijets based on our program @xcite .",
    "three sets of dpdfs were used , the zeus lps fit , determined from a nlo analysis of inclusive diffraction and diffractive charm - production data @xcite , and the two h1 fits , ` h1 2006 fits a , b ' @xcite . the nlo results obtained with the two h1 fits were scaled down by a factor of 0.87 @xcite since the h1 measurements used to derive the dpdfs include low - mass proton dissociative processes with @xmath67 gev , which increases the photon - diffractive cross section by @xmath68 as compared to the pure proton final state as corrected to in the zeus analysis .",
    "the comparison of the measured cross sections and the theoretical predictions was based on the differential cross sections in the variables @xmath46 , @xmath11 , @xmath47 , @xmath33 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath32 .",
    "the data were reasonably well described in their shape as a function of these variables and lay systematically below the predictions .",
    "the predictions for the three dpdfs differed appreciably .",
    "the cross sections for the ` h1 2006 fit a ' ( ` h1 2006 fit b ' ) were the highest ( lowest ) , and the one for the zeus lps fit lay between the two , but nearer to the fit a than the fit b predictions . for",
    "@xmath42 zeus also showed the ratio of the data and the nlo predictions using the zeus lps fit .",
    "the ratio was consistent with a suppression factor of 0.7 independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this suppression factor depended on the dpdfs and ranged between 0.6 ( ` h1 2006 fit a ' ) and 0.9 ( ` h1 2006 fit b ' ) .",
    "taking into account the scale dependence of the theoretical predictions the ratio was outside the theoretical uncertainty for the zeus lps fit and the ` h1 2006 fit a ' , but not for the ` h1 2006 fit b ' . in their conclusions the authors of the zeus analysis @xcite made the statement that the nlo calculations tend to overestimate the measured cross section , which would mean that a suppression is present .",
    "unfortunately , however , they continued , that , within the large uncertainties of the nlo calculations , the data were compatible with the qcd calculations , i.e.  with no suppression .",
    "such a statement clearly contradicts the result of the h1 collaboration @xcite and casts doubts on the correctness of the h1 analysis .",
    "the authors of @xcite attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the h1 measurements @xcite were carried out in a lower @xmath22 and a higher @xmath47 range than those in the zeus study @xcite .",
    "besides the different @xmath22 and @xmath47 regions in @xcite and @xcite the two measurements suffer also from different experimental cuts of some other variables which makes it difficult to compare the two data sets directly ( note also the lower center - of - mass energy for the h1 data ) . with this in mind",
    "the h1 collaboration has done a second analysis , in which most of the experimental cuts are taken as in the zeus @xcite analysis , i.e.  the cuts on @xmath47 , @xmath69 and on @xmath70 . in addition",
    "they analyzed data sets also with the lower @xmath22 cut , namely @xmath71 @xmath66 gev and with @xmath27 as in the previous h1 dijet analysis @xcite .",
    "starting from these recent data @xcite we have performed a new calculation of the nlo cross sections on the basis of @xcite for the new h1 @xcite and the latest zeus @xcite analyses with the same dpdfs as input , in order to see whether we can confirm the different conclusions obtained from the older h1 @xcite and the zeus @xcite measurements . in this new comparison between the experimental and the theoretical results we shall concentrate on using the ` h1 2006 fit b ' as dpdf input , since it leads to smaller nlo cross sections than the dpdfs based on the ` h1 2006 fit a ' or the zeus lps fit .    in section 2",
    "we shall present , after defining the complete list of cuts on the experimental variables and giving all the input used in the cross section calculations , the comparison with the new h1 experimental data @xcite . in this comparison",
    "we shall concentrate on the main question , whether there is a suppression in the photoproduction data at all .",
    "in addition we shall investigate also whether a reasonable description of the data is possible with suppression of the resolved cross section only , as we studied it already in our previous work in 2004 @xcite . in section 3 the same comparison with the zeus data",
    "@xcite will be performed . in section 4",
    "we shall finish with a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the recent h1 data for diffractive photoproduction of dijets have several advantages as compared to the earlier h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite analyses . first , the integrated luminosity is three times higher than in the previous h1 analysis @xcite comparable to the luminosity in the zeus analysis @xcite .",
    "second , h1 took data with low-@xmath22 @xcite and high-@xmath22 @xcite cuts , which allows the comparison with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the exact two kinematic ranges are given in tab .",
    "1 .       high-@xmath22 analyses of h1 , the zeus analysis ( multiplied by a factor of 1.15 to allow for proton dissociation ) , and the zeus analysis renormalized by a factor of @xmath72 for @xmath73 gev and correspondance with the h1 measurements and dpdf fits @xcite .",
    "the first , second and third factors agreed very well with those found by the experimental collaborations when fitting multiple distributions or total cross sections .",
    "the fourth factor ( ` zeus renormalized ' ) agrees better with the second factor , relevant for the similar high-@xmath22 h1 analysis .",
    "we also tested the hypotheses that factorization breaking is only present in the resolved ( third line ) or the resolved and the related initial - state singular part of the direct photoproduction cross sections ( fourth line ) .",
    "both hypotheses gave very similar results and described the data sets almost as well as the predictions with global factorization breaking .",
    "the suppression factors applicable to just the resolved cross section are shown in the third line of tab .",
    "as observed previously @xcite , they agree very well with absorptive - model predictions @xcite .",
    "we conclude that in this case the suppression factors do not show a significant @xmath22-dependence , in particular when renormalizing the zeus data as described above .",
    "the fact that no @xmath22-dependence is visible here can , of course , be explained by the fact that the resolved cross section falls more steeply with @xmath22 than the direct one @xcite . finally , we investigated whether these conclusions depended on the diffractive pdfs by comparing the results with resolved - only suppression of the ` h1 2006 fit b ' to those obtained with the ` h1 2006 fit a ' ( last line in tab .  3 ) .",
    "since the latter has a larger gluon density at large momentum fraction , the suppression had to be more important .",
    "the fit a results then tended to describe the high-@xmath22 h1 data and the zeus data slightly better , in particular in the @xmath33-distribution , which should be directly sensitive to the dpdfs , but the low-@xmath22 h1 data slightly worse .",
    "unfortunately the experimental and theoretical errors are still too large to draw any strong conclusions .",
    "while the epoch of hera experiments has now ended and an international linear collider may not be built in the near future , it will be very interesting to investigate diffractive physics at the lhc .",
    "suprisingly , proton - proton and heavy - ion collisions at the lhc can also be a source of high - energy photon collisions , and this may open up a whole new field of investigation for diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite .",

    "<S> after new publications of h1 data for the diffractive photoproduction of dijets , which overlap with the earlier published h1 data and the recently published data of the zeus collaboration , have appeared , we have recalculated the cross sections for this process in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of perturbative qcd to see whether they can be interpreted consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these calculations are compared to the data of both collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nlo cross sections disagree with the data , showing that factorization breaking occurs at that order . </S>",
    "<S> if direct and resolved contributions are both suppressed by the same amount , the global suppression factor depends on the transverse - energy cut . </S>",
    "<S> however , by suppressing only the resolved contribution , also reasonably good agreement with all the data is found with a suppression factor independent of the transverse - energy cut . </S>"
