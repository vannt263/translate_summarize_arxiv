    "these curves are called the rectifying curves which are not plane curves . they can be equivalently defined as the twisted curves whose osculating planes are at the same distance from a fixed point . here",
    "we consider the curves whose all normal planes are at the same distance from a fixed point and obtain some characterizations of them in the 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we first review the results on the rectifying curves in the 3-dimensional euclidean space , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a unit - speed curve with the position vector @xmath1 .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is the natural parameter of @xmath0 .",
    "frenet formulas follow as    @xmath3    where@xmath4 and @xmath5 are frenet vectors and @xmath6 the curvature and @xmath7 the torsion of the curve.a rectifying curve can be defined by the equation    @xmath8    by means of ( [ 11 ] ) we can write it as    @xmath9    accordingly @xmath10 and so @xmath11integrating  ( [ 14 ] ) we have    @xmath12    where @xmath13is a constant . without loss the generality we can write ( [ 15 ] ) as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a positive number.([12 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) imply that the position vector can be written as @xmath16differentiating ( [ 17 ] ) we have@xmath17and so@xmath18this implies that a rectifying curve is a twisted curve , that is @xmath19on the other hand , from ( [ 17 ] ) we have@xmath20so if a curve is a rectifying curve , then its osculating planes are at the same distance from the origin .",
    "conversely , let us assume that osculating planes of a twisted curve are at the same distance from the origin . differentiating ( [ 19 ] ) we get ( [ 12 ] ) and so it is a rectifying curve .",
    "therefore we have the following property :    _ a twisted curve is a rectifying curve if and only if its osculating planes are at the same distance from a fixed point . _    on the other hand , if a unit spherical curve @xmath21 is defined by the equation    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the position vector of a rectifying curve @xmath24 with the natural parameter @xmath2 , it can be show that the position vector of a rectifying curve @xmath0 can be represented as    @xmath25    where @xmath26is the natural parameter of the spherical curve @xmath27 then the tangent unit vector of the curve @xmath0 can be written as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the tangent unit vector of the spherical curve @xmath30differentiating the last equation we have    @xmath31    @xmath32 is the curvature of the spherical curve @xmath27from ( [ 23 ] ) we find the following relation between the curvatures of the curves @xmath33and @xmath21 associated with each other : @xmath34the last relation can be written , in terms of the natural parameter @xmath2 of the rectifying curve , as    @xmath35",

    "we denote frenet vectors and the curvature and the torsion of @xmath0 by @xmath37 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "we can choose the fixed point as the origin .",
    "therefore our condition becomes    @xmath38    by the integration we find that    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a constant.since the case of @xmath41 corresponds to a spherical curve , we can assume that @xmath42 .",
    "then , without loss the generality , we can write ( [ 32 ] ) as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a positive constant",
    ". then ( [ 31 ] ) reduces to    @xmath45    ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) imply @xmath46differentiating ( [ 34 ] ) we have    @xmath47    or    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the radius of curvature.from ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 37 ] ) we can write the position vector as @xmath50differentiating ( [ 38 ] ) we have    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    therefore we first have@xmath53so the curve is a plane curve if and only if @xmath54without the generality , for case of a plane curve we can write@xmath55then from ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 401 ] ) @xmath56accordingly the natural equations of the curve are    @xmath57    we can now assume that our curve is a twisted curve , that is @xmath58 .",
    "then@xmath59where @xmath60is the radius of torsion .",
    "hence ( [ 38 ] ) can be written as@xmath61therefore , according to ( [ 33 ] ) we have@xmath62on the other hand , from ( [ 402 ] ) we can write@xmath63we can show that ( [ 311 ] ) and ( [ 312 ] ) are equivalent equations .",
    "in fact , the equation ( [ 312 ] ) can be written as    @xmath64[rr^{\\prime } -2\\epsilon c^{2}]=0   \\label{313}\\ ] ]    because of @xmath65 , corresponds to the plane curve .",

    "let us define a unit spherical curve @xmath21 by the equation    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the position vector of a curve with normal planes at constant distance from a fixed point.so we have    @xmath72    differentiating we get    @xmath73    from the last equation we find    @xmath74    for the speed of the spherical curve . and",
    "so the natural parameter of the unit spherical curve@xmath75 , from @xmath76 is obtained as    @xmath77    since    @xmath78    there exists a function @xmath79 which satisfies the equation ( [ 44 ] ) therefore ( [ 41 ] ) can be written as    @xmath80    so for a given curve @xmath0 with normal planes at constant distance from a fixed point , whose position vector is@xmath81 , we have a unit spherical curve @xmath21 whose position vector @xmath82 is defined by ( [ 46 ] ) with the natural parameter @xmath83 .",
    "we call @xmath84the unit spherical curve associated with the curve @xmath0 with normal planes at constant distance from a fixed point",

    "let @xmath87 and @xmath32 and@xmath88 be frenet vectors and the curvature and the torsion of @xmath21 respectively.according to ( [ 44 ] )    @xmath89    differentiating ( [ 47 ] ) with respect to @xmath83 we have    @xmath90    since @xmath91 and @xmath92 from ( [ 49 ] ) we have    @xmath93    so the unit tangent vector of @xmath0 is found as    @xmath94    since @xmath95and @xmath96    @xmath97    this means that the curve @xmath0 is a curve with normal planes at constant distance from a fixed point .",

    "in fact , we can choose the equation of a great circle of the unit sphere as @xmath109since @xmath110@xmath111and@xmath112then from ( [ 42 ] ) we obtain the cartesian equations of the plane curve with normal planes at constant distance from the origin as@xmath113this curve is a plane curve with normal planes at a distance @xmath114 from the origin .",
    "this means that all normal lines of the curve are at a distance @xmath115 from the origin .",
    "so it is an involute of the circle of radius @xmath116 centered at the origin .",
    "since it is an involute of a plane curve , it is also a plane curve ( * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the position vector of an involute @xmath0 of the curve @xmath117 whose position vector is@xmath118can be written as@xmath119where @xmath120is constant and @xmath121 is unit tangent vector to the curve @xmath117 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
