    "the minority game ( mg ) is an adaptive game introduced by challet and zhang @xcite to study competitive systems whose available resources are finite ( ecology , financial systems , traffic in internet , etc ) .    at every step of the game",
    ", the @xmath1 participants ( agents ) must choose one of two alternatives ( 0 or 1 , to buy or to sell , to choose one of two possible routes , etc . ) , and the winners will be those who turn out to be in the minority . each agent decides her move based on the _ history _ of the game ( a string of @xmath2 bits with the information about the @xmath2 previous minority sides ) , using one of her set of @xmath3 prescriptions or _",
    "strategies_. feedback is established by a reward system whereby every winner agent gets a point ; moreover , out of all the strategies in the game , those that correctly predicted the minority side also get a ( so - called virtual ) point .",
    "the game is adaptive , because an agent will make her choise using the strategy that at this particular time has more points .    for every time step ,",
    "let us call @xmath4 ( @xmath5 the number of agents choosing side 0 ( 1 ) , such that @xmath6 .",
    "the main variable that is usually considered is @xmath7 , the standard deviation of the difference ( @xmath8 , as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the number of steps of the game .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath7 is a measure of the form in which the resources ( points ) of the population are used : whenever @xmath11 is small , more agents get a point , implying a better utilization of the resources .",
    "the model has attracted some attention because for certain values of @xmath12 @xmath3 and @xmath1 , @xmath7 turns out to be smaller than @xmath13  the standard deviation of a random - choise game , where the @xmath1 agents choose sides randomly .",
    "this result implies that althought there is no agent - agent interaction in the mg , there is some kind of emergent coordination ; in other words , there is an effective interaction that appears through global magnitudes of the system .",
    "this collective behavior motivated a diversity of studies of the mg , with a variety of techniques : numerical simulations @xcite , @xcite ; mean - field approximations @xcite ; equivalence with spin - glass models @xcite ; thermal treatments @xcite , etc .",
    "manuca et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the complete succession of minority sides , and used a specific mean - field to calculate @xmath7 . in the present work",
    "we calculate @xmath7 for the same set of values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 used by these authors , obtaining a somewhat better agreement with numerical results .",
    "the public information on which strategies are based is the record of the last @xmath2 minority sides ( that is why @xmath2 is called the _ memory _ of the game ) .",
    "then , there are @xmath14 @xmath15 different histories , the history at time @xmath16 being the string @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the minority side ( 0 or 1 ) which results after time @xmath16 . in the following",
    "we will write @xmath19 as an integer between 0 and @xmath20 .",
    "every strategy is a function that assigns _ outputs _ ( predictions of the following minority side ) for every one of the @xmath21 possible _ inputs _ .",
    "hence , there are @xmath22 @xmath23 different strategies in a game of memory @xmath2 ; at the beginning of the game each agent is randomly assigned @xmath3 strategies , from the pool of @xmath22 ( with replacement ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that data for @xmath24 displays scaling for every value of @xmath3 when plotted as a function of  @xmath25 .",
    "in fact the plot of @xmath24 vs @xmath26 has two different regions , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] : _",
    "@xmath27 , which is an informationally efficient phase . here",
    "@xmath24 is a decreasing function of @xmath28 showing a change of behavior  around @xmath29 ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath24 increases and asymptotically approaches the line @xmath31 .",
    "this line corresponds to the random - choise game .",
    "our calculation is appropriate within a good part of the first region .",
    "usually , numerical simulations are carried over for a game of t time steps , and afterwards  the results are averaged over several independent runs of the game . in every run there are @xmath32 strategies distributed between the agents , out of the pool @xmath22 .",
    "there are two points worth noticing : the pool @xmath22 of _ all _ the strategies is _ symmetrical _ , in the sense that for every possible history , the number of strategies predicting @xmath33 is equal to the number of strategies predicting @xmath34 ; on the other hand , every set of @xmath35 strategies used in each run is only _",
    "approximately _ symmetrical , because it is just a finite sample of @xmath22 .",
    "when the sample is only of a moderate size , however , the difference between the properties of the sample and the pool is small , and the corresponding uncertainty is known .",
    "indeed , this is widely used in standard ` sampling ' techniques @xcite : for instance , the uncertainty associated with samples of size @xmath36 is less than @xmath37 .",
    "these considerations are at the base of our calculation , as we now explain .    in the following",
    "we will make analytic calculations over the whole pool @xmath38 , rather than over samples of size @xmath39 . in this form",
    "we will benefit from its symmetry , and also will be able to calculate several magnitudes  by simply counting different sets of pairs of strategies ( for @xmath40 ) . in this sense",
    "we are using sampling techniques the other way around :  we start from the pool , to find the samples properties . as it will be clear below ,",
    "this is a mean - field - like approach .    equation ( [ dispersion ] ) calculates @xmath7 as a time average over @xmath10 time steps . we will replace this by an ensamble average over a ( restricted ) set of states of the system . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the states and describe how a _ period - two dynamics _ observed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to substantially reduce the number of states needed . in sec",
    "iii we write down @xmath7 in terms of the new variables ; to carry out the actual calculation of @xmath7 we found it useful to make use of some ad - hoc diagrams that are also explained . in the final section",
    "we offer some conclusions .",
    "in this work we will only consider games where @xmath41 _ i.e_. every agent has two strategies to choose from . to find @xmath7 from eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) we need to write down expressions for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that the values of these ratios will fluctuate with the actual numerical realization .",
    "we now _ assume _ that we can obtain approximate values for these variables by using not @xmath44 the actual number of agents , but rather a game with @xmath45 , the maximum amount of ( virtual ) agents that can originate in the pool .",
    "@xmath45 is equal to @xmath46 , the number of pairs of strategies that it is possible to make from the pool @xmath22 ( with replacement ) . ] . within this approximation",
    ", we will calculate @xmath42 as @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of virtual agents choosing side 0 ( 1 ) .",
    "we now describe the _ states _ to be used in our ensemble average .",
    "it is convenient to begin by introducing",
    "_ microstates _ of the system . for each time step @xmath16",
    ", we define @xmath50 , the accumulated difference between the number of times that after the appearance of string @xmath51 , the resulting minority side was 1 ( @xmath52 ) or 0 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "a microstate @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 has the information of the net amount of virtual points assigned to the pool of strategies , and @xmath57 is the string containing the history that effectively showed up at time @xmath58 .",
    "the set of microstates is rather complex and very big . in order to get simpler expressions",
    ", we now turn back to the other approximation in which this work is based on , the period - two dynamics observed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a game with @xmath41 @xmath59 ; in this case there are only four strings @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 representing all possible results for the last two minority groups . in their study of the time series of minority groups , manuca et .",
    "al . kept a record of all the times when a given string @xmath64 for instance @xmath65 , appeared .",
    "this record shows a most remarkable behavior : odd occurrences of @xmath19 are followed by a minority side @xmath66whose value is essentially random ( e.g. @xmath67 , while for the next ( even ) occurrence of @xmath19 the result is deterministic , being the opposite of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 in this example ) .",
    "this behavior was described as a period - two dynamics ( ptd ) by those authors , and can be seen to be essentially true for @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , we found that a plot of the probability that the data follows this rule , as a function of @xmath70 displays scaling as can be seen in fig.[regla_savit ] , where one can also see that this probability is greater than 0.5 if @xmath71 0.7 .    the simultaneous use of the pool @xmath22 _ and _ ptd allows a dramatic simplification of the ensemble of states .",
    "to understand this point , let us consider one step @xmath16 of the game where a minority string @xmath19 is followed by a minority side @xmath18 ; as mentioned above , @xmath72 strategies predict this output , and therefore get a point .",
    "now , the next time that the string @xmath19 appears , because of ptd , the _ other _ half of the strategies ( predicting the opposite minority side ) should get a point .",
    "therefore , after an even appearance of @xmath19 , _ all _ strategies will have one extra point . but remember that these points are assigned so that one can choose the more succesfull strategies , simply by picking up that with the greatest amount of points ;  in this sense , nothing should change if , rather than _ adding _ a point to the second half of strategies , we _",
    "remove _ the point we already assigned to the first part .",
    "the implication of this procedure is great : we need to consider only those microstates where @xmath73 in the following , we will always refer to this subset of microstates , and the corresponding states .",
    "a state is defined as the set of microstates that have the same value of the variables  @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath79 can take the values 0 or 1 , while @xmath80 can be equal to 0 or \\{1 , -1 } , respectively ; @xmath81 is the set of all values of @xmath82 it is of some help to think of @xmath83 as an spin and its projection . in the future",
    "we will need to write down the number of microstates of the set , _",
    "i.e. _ the degeneracy of the state , @xmath84    in fig.[diagrama ] we show a diagramatic representation of the microstates , that is also helpful to visualize the states .",
    "each diagram has @xmath85 rows , one for every possible history of @xmath2 bits ; the first column shows the value of @xmath86 ( the values 1 , -1 and 0 are represented by an up or down arrow , and an empty site , respectively ) , and the second column simply displays the actual string @xmath87 there can only be one arrow for row , and up to @xmath88 arrows in the diagram . hence , the maximun number of points that the pool @xmath22 can have is @xmath89 . ; he concluded that memory is irrelevant in the mg , and should not be used to explain its behavior . on the contrary",
    ", savit argued that `` the dynamics and the information structure in the two versions are fundamentally the same '' .",
    "our diagrams are particularly useful to shed some ligth on this point . to choose a string randomly , simply means to choose in this form the row in the _ rigth _ column of our diagrams ; this eventually will change the ` microscopic ' behavior of the model , but the register of what happens after the appearance of any history is not changed , because the rules that govern the _ left _ column of the diagram are not changed . ]",
    "we now have completed the characterization of the states , and can come back to the calculation of  ( @xmath90 as our approach is based on all the pairs of strategies ( _ i.e. _ virtual agents ) that can be formed out of the pool , there are three rather natural magnitudes to consider : @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) the number of agents whose response to a given microstate will be to choose @xmath93(@xmath94 ) with certainty , hence the nickname ` decided ' agents ; and @xmath95 those agents that under the same circumstance can not make up their minds , thus the nickname ` undecided ' . clearly , @xmath45 @xmath96 @xmath97 + @xmath92 + @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , after establishing a method to know how @xmath98 will split into those choosing 0 ( @xmath99 or 1@xmath100 we can write @xmath101    recalling that every possible pair of strategies corresponds to one virtual agent , to obtain the @xmath102 is convenient to know @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the number of strategies with @xmath105 virtual points predicting @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively , as the following minority side after the string @xmath19 . using @xmath108 and @xmath109 as a shortand notation for @xmath103 and  @xmath104 , it is    @xmath110    the last two terms of @xmath91 and @xmath92 are equal to @xmath111 ( where @xmath112 @xmath113 , and are related with those agents for which both of their strategies predict the same side for the string @xmath19",
    ". as we are interested in the difference ( @xmath114 these factors will cancel out , and do nt need to be considered in the following .",
    "microstates @xmath115 , @xmath116 obtained one from the other by interchanging one or more rows in the diagrams of fig.([diagrama ] )  are symmetrical , in the sense that they have the same values @xmath117 : @xmath118 , @xmath119 or @xmath120.this , in turn , implies @xmath121 and similarly for all terms of eq .",
    "( [ enes ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the values of these magnitudes depend only on @xmath122 i.e are state dependent .",
    "therefore , we will only need to consider the @xmath123 for different _ states , _",
    "together with the corresponding degeneracies @xmath124 thus , the expression for the standard deviation becomes    @xmath125 ^{2 }   \\label{dispersion2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath126    for every state , we assume that each undecided agent chooses randomly between @xmath94 and @xmath127 moreover , @xmath128 will be averaged over a certain number of independent runs ; hence , we only need the average values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 that are given by the standard expressions of the random walk , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "then    @xmath133   \\label{dispersion3}\\ ] ]    the calculation of the different terms of eq.([enes ] ) , and the corresponding calculation of @xmath7 ( eq.([dispersion3 ] ) ) is straigthforward , but rather lengthy and cumbersome .",
    "we have displaced to an appendix some of the details ;  on the other hand it is useful to use a graphic representation to find @xmath134 @xmath135 , and show how to obtain these terms .",
    "notice that , regardless of which microstate we are looking at , the set of @xmath136 possible strategies will always split into two groups of @xmath72 strategies each , predicting @xmath94 or @xmath137 respectively ; therefore , we just have to find how each one of these groups will split into smaller subgroups characterized by the number of points .",
    "let us consider , to be specific , the case @xmath59 . in this case , we only need to know the @xmath138 s for ( @xmath139 to @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 and for ( @xmath143 to @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 in fig.([tartaglia ] ) we show these values for the case @xmath145 @xmath147 for strategies predicting @xmath94 as the following minority side .",
    "being @xmath148 implies that we have to consider microstates having @xmath149 .",
    "the simplest form to find the @xmath138 s in this case , is by using the diagrams with one to four arrows .",
    "thus , it is clear that there are @xmath72 strategies with one point ( @xmath150 predicting @xmath94 ) . with @xmath151 ( i.e. @xmath152 )",
    ", there will be @xmath153 strategies predicting only one of the minority sides ( having one point ) , and @xmath153 predicting both minorities correctly ( thus having two points ) ; analogously , for @xmath154 there will be three groups of @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 strategies , with 1 , 2 and 3 points , respectively ; finally , for @xmath158 there are four groups with @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161 and @xmath162 ,  with 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 points respectively .",
    "graphically , this gives rise to a tree , as that shown in fig.[tartaglia ] , in which every row corresponds to a given value of @xmath163 and in every site of the tree one writes @xmath164 in fact , introducing @xmath165 by writing @xmath166 with @xmath167 or @xmath168 it is possible to see that the tree associated with @xmath169 turns out to be tartaglia s triangle , whose analytic properties are well known .",
    "the cases including states where @xmath170  can be handled in the same form .",
    "the difference between states with @xmath171 and @xmath148 it is apparent in the schemes ( a ) and ( c ) of fig.[diagrama ] , but from the point of view of the trees , it simply implies that when @xmath172 the values of @xmath173 are ` shifted ' ; thus the ` upper ' row has @xmath139 , and the  ` lowest ' one has @xmath174 moreover in row @xmath173 , say , the different terms will have 0,1, ... ,@xmath173 points .",
    "all terms needed to calculate @xmath7 are simply related with different sums and products of terms of these trees , without mixing factors from different rows .    to carry out the calculation of @xmath128 we use  @xmath98 , @xmath175  and @xmath176 , as obtained in the appendix .",
    "the actual expressions for @xmath98 and @xmath177 are functions of the value of @xmath178 namely    @xmath179    for @xmath141 and    @xmath180    for @xmath148 .",
    "the state degeneracy is ) is only approximated ]    @xmath181    where @xmath182    two points are worth mentioning , in relation with @xmath183 first , using eq.([n1-n0 ] ) in eq.([dispersion3 ] ) , we verify that @xmath184 can be written just in terms of @xmath98 s factors .",
    "furthermore , this expression can be factored out as follows : @xmath185 @xmath186 .",
    "notice that our general assumptions require to consider @xmath1 big enough , so that the replacement of the samples by the whole pool makes sense ; hence , the factorization should also be valid in the same limit .",
    "our results are presented in fig.[calculo ] .",
    "we have done numerical simulations of the mg for @xmath1 from @xmath187 up to 1001 , 50000 time steps , and @xmath188 up to 13 ; the results where averaged over 32 independent runs .",
    "we show both the usual simulation data , as well as the results of the calculation with the equations derived in this work . as it can be seen , if @xmath189 ( and @xmath190 @xmath191 there is an excellent agreement between these two sets of data .",
    "for @xmath190 between 0.1 and 0.7 we only have a qualitative agreement , and for @xmath192 our results ( not shown ) are clearly inadequate.this coincides with the range of validity of the results of manuca et al .",
    "@xcite , i.e we only cover the informationally efficient phase .",
    "it is to be noticed that in the first region our results can be fitted to a high degree of accuracy by a straight line with slope -1 .",
    "we have made a mean - field - like calculation of @xmath7 , the standard deviation of the mg .",
    "our approach is based on two approximations : on the one hand , rather than using the properties of the actual samples used to calculate , we consider the whole pool of strategies , @xmath22 ; in this form we benefit from the symmetry of the histories . it should be noticed that we actually quote results that are averages over several independent runs , so that it is reasonable to expect that they should be near to the symmetry of the pool . on the other hand",
    ", we considered that the period - two dynamics introduced by manuca et.al @xcite is correct within the range of validity of our work .",
    "we used these approximations to replace the time averages appearing in eq.([dispersion ] ) , by ensemble averages over the states .",
    "our results show an excellent agreement with data from the simulation in the region @xmath193 the calculation embraces an important part of the informationally efficient region , but the agreement is lost when @xmath194 is near of its minimun value .",
    "the values of @xmath197 ( for @xmath198 ) , that we have already identified with the coeficients in tartaglia s triangle , are state dependant ( remember that in site @xmath199 , the coeficient of the tree is the combinatorial @xmath200      where @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 in eq.([allequations]a - c ) , respectively . in the first equation @xmath172 and",
    "therefore @xmath207 , while the last two equations correspond to states with @xmath148 , then @xmath208 .",
    "notice that this ` nasty ' collection of coefficients can be identified with combinations of elements of the trees .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath98 in eq.([enes ] ) ; in this case both trees ( for @xmath94 or @xmath137 ) are equal , and @xmath98 is given by the sum of the squares of the factors in row @xmath173 of the tree .        where @xmath226 the first factor counts the number of ways that @xmath173 arrows can be distributed into @xmath88 places , the second is the number of strings available for being the actual history ( @xmath227 in the diagrams ) , and the third takes into account that each arrow can be up or down ."
