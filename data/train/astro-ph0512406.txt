    "one of the most interesting observational discoveries in the past decade has been the evidence that the expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down .",
    "a currently accelerating universe is strongly favored by type ia supernova data @xcite .",
    "recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite and of the large scale structure by redshift surveys e.g the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the 2-degree field ( 2df ) redshift survey @xcite have further strengthened this result .",
    "this result together with the observational evidence that we are living in a low matter density ( around @xmath2 of the critical density ) flat ( @xmath3 ) universe , suggests the existence of a relatively smooth component called `` dark energy '' which dominates the energy density of the universe and also has a large negative pressure .",
    "although a simple cosmological constant @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) can serve the purpose of this dark energy , it faces a serious problem of fine tuning ( for details , see recent review by padamnabhan @xcite ) .",
    "the alternative possibility called quintessence @xcite , is a varying @xmath4 model , where dark energy arises from a minimally coupled scalar field rolling over its potential . for a sufficiently flat potential , the potential energy term dominates and the scalar field can mimic @xmath4 .",
    "recently , an alternative possibility , that of an effective scalar field theory governed by a lagrangian containing a non - canonical kinetic term ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ) has been proposed .",
    "such a model can lead to a late time acceleration in the present universe and is named as `` k - essence '' @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the generalized chaplygin gas model @xcite and the tachyon dark energy models @xcite may be seen as special cases of k - essence ( e.g k - essence with a constant potential can mimic simple chaplygin gas ( cg ) model @xcite ) .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "it is not only important to check whether dark energy is a constant or dynamical , but also if dynamical , it is equally important to know the lagrangian for the underlying field . for a minimally coupled scalar field model , a number of studies",
    "have been done for reconstructing the potential for this scalar field in a model independent way by using observational data @xcite .",
    "recently tsujikawa has studied the reconstruction of the potential function @xmath8 in the k - essence lagrangian once one assumes a certain form for the kinetic energy function @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "but until now , there is no attempt in the literature to reconstruct in a model independent way the function @xmath9 in the k - essence lagrangian .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a algorithm ( similar to that proposed by simon et al .",
    "@xcite for a minimally coupled scalar field model ) to reconstruct @xmath9 in a model independent way . for present purposes ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the potential @xmath8 is a constant . using this algorithm and three specific ansatzes for the hubble parameter @xmath0 ( consistent with the supernova observations ) ,",
    "we reconstruct @xmath9 in the redshift range between @xmath10 and @xmath11 which is the current range for the supernova data .",
    "in a spatially flat frw universe , the luminosity distance @xmath12 and the coordinate distance @xmath13 to an object at redshift @xmath14 are related as    @xmath15    where we have assumed the speed of light @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the scale factor and quantities with subscript zero denote the values at present time ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this defines uniquely the hubble parameter    @xmath19^{-1}.\\ ] ]    this is a purely kinematic relation and does not depend on the choice of the matter part or the model of gravity . hence knowing @xmath12 from observations",
    ", one can unambiguously determine the hubble parameter @xmath0 .",
    "next , analogous to the inflationary hubble - flow parameter , we define the quantity @xcite ,    @xmath20    for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 $ ] is the number of e - foldings from some initial epoch @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "one can now calculate @xmath25 as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the deceleration parameter .",

    "we should emphasize that current supernova data can constrain up to the third derivative of the scale factor which means the deceleration parameter @xmath27 and the jerk parameter @xmath32 can be determined .",
    "next , we define the energy density and pressure for a k - essence fluid . for a k - field @xmath33 with a lagrangian @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , the energy density and pressure are given by @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ p_{\\phi }     &",

    "one can always make a taylor expansion of @xmath51 around the present epoch @xmath10 :    @xmath56    .",
    "hence it is always possible to determine the approximate behavior of @xmath51 around the present epoch by knowing @xmath0 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 etc at present ( @xmath10 ) from supernova observations even if one does not know the full evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "current supernova data can only determine up to @xmath60 @xcite , hence in this way one can determine @xmath51 around the present epoch up to only linear order .",
    "but as future observations start probing the universe at higher redshifts , one can determine the higher derivatives of @xmath57 , and hence the higher order behavior of @xmath51 .",
    "this provides a nice and useful method of determining the behavior of @xmath51 around the present epoch from future distance - redshift observations .",
    "but our goal is to reconstruct @xmath9 , which is not what eqn ( 11 ) or ( 15 ) provides . for this",
    ", we consider the energy conservation equation for the k - field :    @xmath61    which gives a first integral for @xmath9 as @xcite    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is an arbitrary integration constant .",

    "( 19 ) gives @xmath66 as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "hence together , they determine @xmath9 .",
    "this is important as we want to know @xmath9 not @xmath51 .",
    "as mentioned above , our method of successful reconstruction of @xmath9 depends on a sufficiently versatile fitting function for @xmath0 . for our purpose we shall use the following flexible and model independent ansatzs :    * ansatz 1 * : @xmath71^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this has been proposed by alam et al .",
    "for a flat universe , the model has three independent parameters as @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "the ansatz becomes an exact @xmath4cdm model .",
    "for @xmath74 and for @xmath75 , it gives a dark energy model with @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "it has also been shown by alam et al .",
    "@xcite that even for models where this ansatz is not exact , like tracker quintessence models , supergravity models or k - essence models like the chaplygin gas , one can recover the luminosity distance to within @xmath78 accuracy using this ansatz in the redshift range that is relevant for supernova observations .",
    "hence one can trust this ansatz to recover cosmological quantities to a high degree of accuracy for a large class of models .",
    "best fit values for the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , for the sn1a gold dataset @xcite and will be used for subsequent reconstruction .    .",
    "* ansatz 2 * : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants .",
    "this ansatz was first discussed by chevallier and polarski @xcite and later studied more elaborately by linder @xcite . for low redshifts",
    ", the ansatz reduces to the conventional first order expansion to the equation of state @xmath87 .",
    "it is also well behaved and bounded for high redshifts and can mimic several scalar field equations of state .",
    "for example , for the supergravity model , the ansatz can mimic the distance - redshift behavior to @xmath88 up to redshift @xmath89 .",
    "the best fit values for this model while fitting with the sn1a gold dataset are @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we shall use these values for the parameters for the reconstruction .",
    "* ansatz 3 * : @xmath92^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are constant .",
    "this ansatz for the hubble parameter @xmath0 can be obtained by modeling the dark energy as generalized chaplygin gas with an equation of state @xmath95 @xcite . by choosing different ranges for the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 ,",
    "this ansatz can behave as standard dark energy model with asymptotic de - sitter phase , early phantom model , late phantom phantom model as well as transient model where the present acceleration of the universe is only temporary as it again enters the dust - dominated decelerating phase in future .",
    "recently it has been shown that current sn1a gold data can allow all four behaviors of this model with suitable choice of the matter density parameter @xmath67 @xcite . for our analysis ,",
    "we have considered four combinations of ( @xmath96 ) : ( 0.95 , 0.2 ) , ( 0.85 , -1.2 ) , ( 1.1 -0.8 ) and ( 1.5 , -1.7 ) , which result in the standard , transient , early phantom and late phantom phases respectively for @xmath67 = 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 and 0.35 .",
    "all these combinations for ( @xmath96 ) are within the @xmath97 confidence contour for sn1a gold dataset @xcite .    .",
    "* results * :    in fig 1 , we have plotted the reconstructed @xmath1 as a function of @xmath98 for ansatz 1 and 2 . for both of these ansatzes , the reconstructed f(x ) is a double - valued function of x. this behaviour of @xmath9 is not what one should expect for any physically realistic lagrangian . to see the reason behind this pathological behaviour for @xmath9 , one has to carefully study the equations .",
    "first of all , one can see both of these ansatzes allow the crossing of the phantom divide ( @xmath99 ) @xcite .",
    "also @xmath100 has a minimum in both cases with @xmath101 and the minimum occurs precisely when the equation of state crosses the phantom divide @xmath5 ( see fig 2 and 3 ) . on the other hand , @xmath1 is a monotonically decreasing function with @xmath14 within the relevant redshift range .",
    "this forces @xmath1 to be a double - valued function of @xmath66 when @xmath1 doubles back on itself at @xmath102 .",
    "hence one might suspect that this unphysical behaviour of @xmath9 is due to the crossing of phantom divide .    .",
    "to see that this is actually the reason , let us consider the equation of state of the k - essence fluid : @xmath103    in order to have @xmath5 , one should have @xmath102 , or @xmath104 , or both . but looking at the equation of motion ( eqn 17 ) , one concludes that it is not possible ( except at future infinity @xmath105 ) , unless @xmath102 and @xmath106 as @xmath107 , so that the l.h.s of eqn .",
    "17 remains finite . also ,",
    "to cross the boundary @xmath5 , @xmath108 should change its sign at @xmath102 . these two conditions ( e.g @xmath108 diverges and changes sign at @xmath102 ) together single out the sole possibility of @xmath9 being a double - valued function and crossing back on itself at @xmath102 , the point of phantom crossing .",
    "this rules out any physically realistic lagrangian @xmath9 for a k - essence field which allows phantom crossing .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results by vikman @xcite and caldwell and doran @xcite who have made a more elaborate study for phantom crossing with a k - essence field and arrived at similar conclusions .",
    "( see also the more recent investigation @xcite . )    but one can check that restricting the equation of state from crossing the phantom divide can result in a well - behaved reconstructed @xmath9 .",
    "this happens for our ansatz 3 which although perfectly consistent with the recent sn1a data , never crosses the phantom divide . in this case",
    "the reconstructed @xmath9 is shown in fig 4 for four different models and it can be seen that @xmath9 is a perfectly well - behaved single valued function for all four cases .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for standard and transient models ( non - phantom cases ) , @xmath1 is a monotonically decresing function of @xmath66 whereas for early and late phantom models , it is an increasing function of @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . this is because for @xmath109 , the sign of @xmath110 is related to the value of @xmath111 ( see eqn.(23 ) ) and for phantom models , @xmath112 , whereas for non - phantom case , @xmath113 as @xmath9 is always positive for all four cases in the relevant redshift range ( see fig 5 ) .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath100 and @xmath51 for this ansatz are shown in fig 5 .    .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a method for reconstructing the k - essence lagrangian for constant potential . in doing so",
    ", we have defined the parameters @xmath114 , which are similar to the horizon - flow parameters for inflation . using these parameters ,",
    "we have related @xmath51 and @xmath115 to the directly observable quantities like @xmath116 , @xmath57 , @xmath0 .",
    "equations ( 11 ) and ( 19 ) are the core of our reconstruction program . by knowing @xmath0 from distance - redshift measurements like snia observations , one can reconstruct @xmath1 as a function of redshift @xmath14 and @xmath66 , the kinetic energy .",
    "later , we have used three well known ansatz for @xmath0 , in order to reconstruct @xmath1 for @xmath10 to @xmath11 which is the current redshift range for snia data .",
    "we should emphasize that our reconstruction program only involves that portion of @xmath9 over which the field evolves to give the required @xmath0 and is insensitive to certain ranges in @xmath66 .",
    "our study shows that in order to have a physically realistic k - essence lagrangian @xmath9 , the crossing of the phantom boundary @xmath5 is forbidden . for ansatzes 1 and 2 , which allow the phantom crossing ,",
    "the reconstructed @xmath1 s are physically unrealistic double - valued functions of @xmath66 .",
    "this result is consistent with earlier investigations with similar conclusion @xcite .",
    "for ansatz 3 , which is also consistent with sn1a data but does not allow phantom crossing , the reconstructed @xmath9 is a well - behaved , single valued function .",
    "the result also shows that one has to be careful while choosing different ansatzes for @xmath0 or @xmath117 for dark energy to fit different observational data . while some of them are perfectly consistent with observation , it may not be possible to relate them to any physically realistic theory",
