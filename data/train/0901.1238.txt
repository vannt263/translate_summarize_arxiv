    "stellar mass black hole binaries ( bhb ) are generically very variable on timescales of 100 - 0.1s ( 0.01 - 10 hz ) .",
    "a power spectral analysis of the light curve shows that there are often quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) superimposed on a broad band noise continuum .",
    "there are several distinct types of qpo , but the most prominent is at low frequencies . this qpo frequency _ moves _ from @xmath2  hz in a way which is tightly correlated with changes in the energy spectrum of the source , with both being dependent on the ( average ) mass accretion rate . at low luminosities ,",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a hard ( photon index @xmath3 ) power law tail , peaking at  100 kev ( low / hard state ) and the qpo is a weak and broad feature at low frequencies .",
    "as the source brightens , there is an increasing contribution from the disc at low energies and the tail softens towards @xmath4 ( intermediate state ) as the qpo increases in frequency and becomes more coherent .",
    "the tail can then either remain strong as the source flux increases , giving a very high state with @xmath5 , and strong qpo at @xmath6  hz , or it can carry only a very small fraction of the luminosity , giving the high / soft state with @xmath7 and a weak or often non existent qpo ( e.g. the reviews by remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 , hereafter dgk07 ) .    despite this qpo being known for many decades ( e.g. van der klis 1989 ) , its origin is still not understood .",
    "the frequency is far too low to be associated with the orbital ( keplarian ) timescale at the last stable orbit , and the change in frequency also rules out any association with a fixed radius .",
    "instead , the correlation of the qpo frequency with the spectral properties suggests another possibility .",
    "the current best models for the hard spectra seen in the low / hard state require that the cool , geometrically thin , optically thick disc is truncated at some radius , @xmath8 , which is larger than the last stable orbit .",
    "the inner accretion flow instead forms a hot , geometrically thick , optically thin configuration .",
    "the spectral evolution within the low / hard state can be explained if the truncation radius of the thin disc moves inwards with increasing mass accretion rate , leading to greater illumination of the hot flow by the cool disc photons , and hence to steeper spectra .",
    "this gives a physical basis for the hard - soft transition when the disc finally reaches the last stable orbit ( esin et al 1997 ; dgk07 ) and is supported by direct observations of the disc receding in the soft - hard transition ( gierlinski , done & page 2008 ) .",
    "the inner radius of the thin disc _",
    "moves _ in these models , giving a possible origin for the moving qpo frequency .    however , this only gives a qualitative association for the characteristic frequency .",
    "a quantitative model linking the changing truncation radius @xmath9 to the qpo frequency is required .",
    "fundamentally , there are 3 frequencies associated with a given radius , @xmath10 , namely that of a circular orbit in the equatorial plane , @xmath11 , a circular orbit inclined at angle @xmath12 to the equatorial plane , @xmath13 , and an elliptical orbit in the equatorial plane with mean radius @xmath10 , @xmath14 . in general relativity ( as opposed to newtonian gravity ) @xmath15 , giving precession of the periastron of a radially perturbed ( elliptical ) orbit .",
    "this returns to its original azimuth on the pericenter precession frequency @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , tilted orbits have @xmath17 if the black hole is spinning , leading to a lense - thirring precession frequency of @xmath18 .",
    "relativistic precession models use these frequencies directly in order to produce the observed qpos , identifying the low frequency qpo ( lf qpo ) with lense - thirring precession ( stella & vietri 1998 ; stella et al 1999 ; psaltis & norman 2000 , fragile et al 2001 ) .",
    "however , there are several problems with such an identification .",
    "firstly , this associates the frequency with the inner edge of the thin ( cool ) disc , yet the qpo ( and all the rapid variability ) are associated with the tail , not the disc ( churazov et al 2001 ; sobelewska & zycki 2006 ) . secondly , and more fundamentally",
    ", it requires that all bhb are spinning .",
    "given their birth in the collapsing core of a massive star this is not surprising , with estimates of @xmath19 ( gammie , shapiro & mckinney 2004 ) .",
    "however , this allows for a _ range _ of spins in the bhb , as is also suggested by observations ( davis , done & blaes 2006 ; shafee et al 2006 ) .",
    "the lense - thirring precession timescale depends strongly on spin , so predicts that the same truncation radius in bhb of different spin should give different qpo frequencies .",
    "yet observations seem to show little difference in qpo frequencies from object to object ( sobczak et al 2000 ; pottschmidt et al 2003 , kalemci et al 2004 , belloni et al 2005 ) .",
    "this makes any lense - thirring model appear uncomfortably fine - tuned , especially in the light of tight correlation between the low frequency break in the power spectrum and qpo frequency which extends across both black hole _ and _ neutron stars ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "the low frequency break is most plausibly from the viscous timescale at @xmath9 ( psaltis & norman 2000 ; dgk07 ) , so does not depend on spin , unlike a lense - thirring model for the qpo .",
    "any range in spin between different objects ( and neutron star spins are _ known _ to range between @xmath20 , while the black hole spins can plausibly be significantly larger ) should then give rise to a large dispersion in the break - qpo relation , yet the data limit this to less than a factor of 2 ( klein - wolt & van der klis 2008 ) .",
    "here we show how lense - thirring models can match the observations by considering the physical interpretation of recent numerical simulations . specifically , we suggest that the _ shape _ of the warped , geometrically thick accretion flow which fills the region inside @xmath9 affects the frequency at which it precesses .",
    "we discuss how this precession can modulate the hard x - ray emission in order to produce the observed energy dependence as well as frequency behaviour of the qpo .",
    "the lense - thirring precession frequency for pro - grade orbits in the limit of a small perturbation with respect to the equatorial plane is @xmath21 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath1 is the dimensionless spin per unit mass and @xmath10 is the dimensionless orbital radius ( in units of @xmath23 ) .",
    "we assume a black hole mass of @xmath24 throughout this paper .",
    "figure [ fig : point ] shows the precession frequency for a variety of black hole spins from @xmath25 as a function of radius down to the last stable orbit , @xmath26 .",
    "this clearly shows that the highest frequency predicted is heavily dependent on spin , and that these are well in excess of the @xmath27hz maximum observed qpo frequency for @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding keplarian frequencies ( upper lines ) plotted for comparison trace out even higher values .",
    "= 8.5 cm      the simple estimates in the previous section assumed single particle orbits at the truncation radius of the thin disc , @xmath9 .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the qpo clearly associates it with the hot flow rather than the disc .",
    "thus we consider lense - thirring precession of the geometrically thick , hot flow interior to the truncated disc as illustrated in figure [ fig : schem ] .",
    "fragile et al . ( 2007 ) estimate the associated frequency assuming that the black hole torque from the misalignment makes the entire flow precess as a solid body between an inner and outer radius , @xmath29 and @xmath9 ( again scaled in units of @xmath30 to make them dimensionless ) .",
    "this gives @xmath31 } { r_o^{5/2-\\zeta}r_i^{1/2+\\zeta } [ 1-(r_i / r_o)^{5/2-\\zeta}]}\\frac{c}{r_g } \\label{eqn : tprec}\\ ] ] where the moment of inertia of the disc is calculated assuming a surface density of the form @xmath32 .",
    "classical advection dominated accretion flows give @xmath33 , while thin discs have @xmath34 , and the numerical simulations give @xmath35 .",
    "we choose @xmath36 , but note this makes less than a factor of 2 difference from the other prescription for the resultant qpo frequency even at the largest radii , and that this difference decreases monotonically as @xmath9 decreases .",
    "figure [ fig : torlso ] shows the precession frequency plotted against @xmath9 for a number of spins with @xmath37 .",
    "these frequencies are always higher at a given @xmath9 as the effective radius is a surface density weighted average from @xmath29 to @xmath9 we still , however , see the same two problems encountered in section [ sec : testmass ] , namely , that the peak frequency is too high and varies too strongly with spin .",
    "-90 = 3.0 cm    = 8.5 cm      so far we have considered a flow with its inner radius at the last stable orbit . instead , the precession timescale is set by where the surface density drops significantly , as the region interior to this will not contribute significantly to the moment of inertia .",
    "full general relativistic simulations of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , the underlying source of the stresses which transport angular momentum ) show that this drops sharply at around @xmath38 ( e.g. fig 4 . in krolik , hawley & hirose 2005 ) for thick flows aligned with the black hole spin .",
    "however , we are considering lense - thirring precession so the key issue is that the flow is _ misaligned_. the extra torques on the flow give extra contributions to the stresses . simulations ( e.g. fragile et al 2007 ) have shown this to increase the inward velocity , and therefore decrease the density of the flow .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma ] shows the surface density profile obtained from two simulations , both of a flow misaligned by @xmath39 but with differing black hole spin .",
    "the blue points are for @xmath40 ( fragile et al 2007 ) and the red points are for @xmath41 ( fragile et al 2009 ) .",
    "we have fit the data with a smoothly broken power law function @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , while @xmath48 controls the sharpness of the break .",
    "we fix @xmath36 ( see section [ sec : torlso ] ) and obtain @xmath49 for @xmath40 and @xmath50 for @xmath41 , both of which are significantly larger than @xmath51 for untilted flows .    ideally , we would now like to re - plot figure [ fig : torlso ] using the inner radius for a misaligned flow .",
    "however , we only have two simulation points for @xmath29 which is clearly inadequate for our purposes .",
    "we therefore make an analytical approximation in the next section in order to address this point .",
    "= 8.5 cm      the additional torques will be strongest where the flow is most misaligned , so these should track the _ shape _ of the flow .",
    "this is set by bending waves , which communicate the warp and twist in initially circular and coplanar orbits , against viscous damping .",
    "analytic approximations to the resulting shape can be calculated assuming linear perturbations in an initially thin disc ( e.g. ferreira & ogilvie 2008 ) .",
    "the global structure then depends on the ratio of the viscosity parameter , @xmath52 , relative to the disc semi - thickness , @xmath53 . for @xmath54 ,",
    "warped disturbances via lense - thirring precession are propagated by viscous decay which eventually drags the inner disc into alignment with the black hole spin , while the outer disc aligns with the orbital plane of the companion star ( bardeen & peterson 1975 , king et al 2005 ) .",
    "the bardeen - petterson transition radius can be roughly defined as the point where viscosity can no longer propagate warps in the disc outward quickly enough to prevent a twisting of the disc due to differential precession .",
    "however , we are considering instead a hot inner flow which is geometrically thick so @xmath55 . in this case , the warp is propagated via bending waves .",
    "the local sound crossing timescale is shorter than the precession timescale throughout the flow allowing the material to be strongly coupled by pressure waves .",
    "consequently , the flow precesses as a solid body ( fragile et al 2007 ) with its shape influenced by the bending waves ( ferraria & ogilvie 2008 ; pringle 1992 , lubow et al .",
    "undamped bending waves have a characteristic wavelength of @xmath56 these waves are , therefore , smooth at large radii and oscillatory at small radii due to the strong @xmath10 dependence of the wavelength .",
    "figure 12 in fragile et al ( 2007 ) and figure 10 in fragile et al ( 2009 ) show the tilt angle of the flow at varying radii for @xmath40 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "this tilt angle increase dramatically at small radii in a manner similar to that of the bending waves .",
    "it could be that this rapid change in disc tilt gives rise to additional stresses which lead to the observed drop off in surface density .",
    "it is encouraging that figure 13 in fragile et al ( 2007 ) seems to support this assertion as it shows that the viscosity parameter of the disc , @xmath52 , increases rapidly at small radii .    the largest radius at which the rate of change of disc tilt is significant is @xmath58 i.e. at @xmath59 (",
    "using equation [ eqn : lambda ] ) as this is the first point at which the bending waves have room to turn over . a more rigorous treatment by lubow et al ( 2002 ) gives @xmath60 .",
    "both of these expressions give @xmath27 and @xmath61 for @xmath40 and @xmath57 , respectively , for @xmath62 , in agreement with the simulations ( see section [ sec : beta ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nuprecro ] shows the precession frequency recalculated assuming the inner radius as above .",
    "we see that the expected decrease in qpo frequency with spin is offset by the increase in inner radius with spin .",
    "counter - intuitively , the qpo probes smaller radii in the flow for lower black hole spins ! figure [ fig : nuprecro ] is in fact remarkably like the observed data in that it predicts a maximum frequency of @xmath27  hz for all spins considered here ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it also predicts the frequency to be mostly dependent on the outer radius of the flow , not spin , which allows the qpo frequency to tightly correlate with any other frequency picked out by this radius , e.g. the low frequency break in the broad band power spectrum ( psaltis et al 1999 ; wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; psaltis & norman 2000 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    this is a very encouraging result , but we caution that many more simulations are needed to quantify the behaviour the inner radius as a function of spin , and to assess the effect of misalignment angle ( both current simulations are for @xmath63 ) .",
    "such simulations also mean that the simplified form of the surface density profile in equation 2 can be replaced by the _ observed _ precession frequency of the flow . however , the two current simulations show the drawback of this approach as this is also sensitive to the _ outer _ boundary condition .",
    "our model sets the outer radius of the precessing flow by the inner edge of the truncated disc .",
    "the flow can only freely precess in the region where there is no thin disc blocking the mid - plane .",
    "instead , the current simulations only include the hot flow , and its effective outer radius is larger for the @xmath41 run than in the @xmath40 and the precession frequency directly observed from the simulations is roughly a factor of two higher for @xmath40 than for @xmath57 .",
    "thus the simulations need also to include an outer boundary condition in order to properly explore parameter space , and to consider the additional torque on the flow from the interaction between the thin disc and hot flow which adds a great deal of complexity .",
    "the lense - thirring frequency of the inner flow precessing as a solid disc does not match observed lf qpo frequencies if we assume the inner radius of the flow is set by the last stable orbit .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations show that the surface density profile of a misaligned flow drops substantially at radii which are significantly larger than @xmath26 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we postulate that this radius is set by the shape of the bending waves which distort the disc .",
    "this radius increases with @xmath1 in a way that counteracts most of the expected increase in qpo frequency with spin at a given @xmath9 .",
    "this results in a maximum value of @xmath64 for a @xmath65 black hole of almost any spin , as observed .",
    "clearly this conclusion depends on the outcome of future numerical simulations .",
    "it also depends on the flow being misaligned !",
    "the bardeen - peterson effect dictates that a misaligned thin disc will gradually align with the black hole at small enough radii ( bardeen & peterson 1974 ) .",
    "most analytical estimates predict that the disc should be more or less aligned at typical values of the truncation radius ( e.g. fragile et al 2001 ) .",
    "this , therefore , implies that the flow should be aligned if most of the material for the hot flow accretes through the outer disc which , in turn , implies that it should nt precess",
    "! however , the thin disc alignment should be rather different for a truncated thin disc .",
    "we intend to explore this effect in future work .",
    "these caveats aside , we have a very attractive model for the origin of the low frequency qpo in black hole binaries .",
    "this is made even more compelling as it ties the qpo to the hot flow , so should directly modulate the comptonised tail , as observed , even though the outer radius @xmath9 is determined by the thin disc .",
    "there are several processes which can imprint the modulation on the spectrum .",
    "the flow is translucent ( optical depth , @xmath66 ) so there can be weak projected area effects .",
    "more importantly , the flow can self - occult causing a dip in the flux of maximum depth @xmath67 when the flow is aligned with the observer s line of sight .",
    "there should also be a variation in the number of seed photons from the disc irradiating the flow which , for example , will give maximum flux when the flow is maximally misaligned with the disc .",
    "relativistic effects can also contribute to the modulation ( schnittman , homan & miller 2006 ; schnittman & rezzolla 2006 )    these effects will give a stronger modulation for higher inclination angles , and higher optical depth .",
    "there is observational evidence for both of these , with a compilation of bhb showing that the maximum qpo r.m.s .",
    "strength increases with inclination , and with mass accretion rate i.e. optical depth of the hot flow ( schnittman , homan , & miller 2006 ) .",
    "this can also explain why the qpos appear stronger on the hard  to  soft transition during the rapid rise to outburst than on the soft  to  hard transition on the decline .",
    "the hysteresis effect ( plausibly caused by the rapid rise driving the disc into a non - steady state configuration : dgk07 ) means that the luminosity during the rise is higher , so the mass accretion rate through the hot flow and hence its optical depth are both also larger , giving stronger modulation .",
    "this all fits well with the observations that broader , weaker qpos are seen in the low inclination systems such as 4u  1543 - 47 ( schnittman , homan & miller 2006 ) .",
    "our model also _ predicts _ that cyg x-1 should have the weakest qpos , as observed , as it is both at low inclination _ and _ is stable to the hydrogen ionisation instability which drives the enhanced optical depth seen during hysteresis ( dgk07 ) .",
    "the physical processes in our model are scale invariant ,",
    "so predict that the frequencies for a given black hole spin , @xmath1 , depend linearly on mass , as generally assumed ( vaughan & uttley 2005 ; gierlinski et al 2008 ; middleton et al 2008 ) .",
    "the bhb alone probably span @xmath68 ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) , so this predicts a factor of 2.3 variation in frequency which may be detectable .",
    "lense - thirring precession of a radially extended section of the hot inner flow in the truncated disc models can match the properties of the low frequency qpo in bhb .",
    "the outer radius of the precessing flow is set by the truncation radius of the cool disc .",
    "this sweeps inwards as the source makes a transition from the low / hard to high / soft state ( dgk07 ) .",
    "the surface density of a misaligned flow drops off at an inner radius greater than the last stable orbit ( fragile et al 2007 ) .",
    "the expected increase in qpo frequency with spin is mostly counteracted by the increasing inner radius in our ( albeit speculative ) models for @xmath29 .",
    "this gives a maximum predicted qpo frequency of 6 - 10  hz irrespective of spin , as observed in all bhb .",
    "thus while the qpo mechanism fundamentally depends on black hole spin , the behaviour of the inner radius of the hot flow means that it does _ not _ give a simple diagnostic of @xmath1 .",
    "the qpo arises from the hot flow , so naturally modulates the hard x - ray flux through a combination of self occultation , projected area and relativistic effects .",
    "these become stronger as a function of inclination and optical depth , as observed .",
    "this gives the first mechanism for the qpo which predicts both its frequency and spectral behaviour , and embeds it firmly in the models for the accretion flow and associated jet .",
    "if confirmed by further numerical simulations , this solves the 20 year mystery of how these characteristic frequencies arise in the accretion flow .",
