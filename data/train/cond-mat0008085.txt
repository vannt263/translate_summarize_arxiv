    "when a system is in contact with a heat bath , in the most common situation it relaxes toward the equilibrium state rather rapidly , typically in a manner characterized by exponential decay , except at a phase transition point .",
    "for instance , a hot particle in cold water generally loses its energy very quickly . however , does such rapid relaxation of a high - energy state hold generally ?",
    "consider , for example , a system composed of several elements that is in contact with a heat bath only through its outer part .",
    "a protein molecule in water represents such an example , since the hydrophobic part of a protein molecule will be segregated from an aqueous solution @xcite . in such a situation , the relaxation process of the internal part naturally depends on the dynamics of the whole system , including the temporal and spatial relationship between the internal and external parts . indeed , it has been reported that proteins excited into high - energy states , exhibit very slow relaxation , compared with that seen in standard dissipation processes in systems of similar size @xcite .",
    "such long - term energy storage may be necessary for proteins to work functionary .",
    "for instance , consider a thermal ratchet model @xcite for motor proteins that work in a heat bath . in the model , the existence of both high and low temperature domains in proteins",
    "are assumed , to generate a directive motion .",
    "then , for such a mechanism to work , it should be answered how the proteins maintain a high energy ( i.e. , keep an effectively high temperature state ) at a localized domain within them .    in connection with this long - term energy storage in proteins ,",
    "two of the present authors @xcite have studied a model of a coupled pendulum in partial contact with a heat bath .",
    "it was found that when a pendulum that is not in contact with a heat bath is highly excited , the energy dissipates only slowly , approximately with logarithmic decay .",
    "this slow relaxation seems to be consistent with the boltzmann - jeans conjecture @xcite for very slow relaxation in hamiltonian systems without contact to a heat bath . in such systems ,",
    "the relaxation time increases exponentially of some positive power of the injected energy @xcite .    when all elements in a hamiltonian system are in full contact with a heat bath , the mechanism allowing for slow relaxation may be destroyed completely . on the other hand ,",
    "when a system contacts a heat bath only through an external part , the internal part can evolve according to its ` own ' dynamics .",
    "for this reason , the internal hamiltonian dynamics may have a strong influence on the relaxation process , and this can lead to a slow relaxation process and long - term energy storage .",
    "it is thus important to study how a system in partial contact with a heat bath insulates its internal part from the effect of the heat bath .    to study such behavior of hamiltonian systems in partial contact with a heat bath ,",
    "we adopt a simple model , introduced in  2 , consisting of two coupled elements : the first element is in direct contacted with a heat bath to allow for the dissipation of the energy , while the second element interacts only with the first element , and not directly with the heat bath .",
    "we study relaxation from a far - from - equilibrium state by preparing the second element in a highly excited state with a large kinetic energy .",
    "the first element , on the other hand , remains always in near - equilibrium with the heat bath .",
    "it should be noted that , without the heat bath , the presently studied hamiltonian system is always integrable and does not relax , even when prepared in a highly excited state",
    ". therefore the relaxation of the second element to thermal equilibrium is due to the indirect effect of the heat bath . in  3 , the relaxation equation for the underdamped limit",
    "is obtained , while the case of the overdamped limit is studied in  4 .",
    "the validity of these equations is confirmed by numerical simulations discussed in  5 .",
    "relaxation in the intermediate damping case is examined in  6 .",
    "the results of numerical experiments for this case are also reported there . from these analytical and computational studies , two kinds of power law",
    "are obtained for the underdamped and overdamped cases , respectively .",
    "it is found that these power laws are independent of the temperature .",
    "to study relaxation of a system with internal degrees of freedom that is in partial contact with a heat bath , we consider a hamiltonian system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom of the general form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a periodic function of period @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 . considering the system to be in partial contact with a heat bath , and adopting the standard representation of the heat bath , we take the motion of the elements to be given by the following langevin equations : @xmath5 here the random force @xmath6 due to the heat bath consists of a gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 representing the temporal average .",
    "( we use units in which @xmath10 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the dissipation coefficient characterizing the dissipation to the heat bath , and @xmath12 is the temperature of the heat bath . with such contact to a heat bath , it is generally expected that a system of this kind will relax to equilibrium .",
    "the change of the total energy @xmath13 due to dissipation to the heat bath can be written @xmath14 and we see that @xmath13 remains constant if there is no contact ( @xmath15 ) with the heat bath .    using the set of variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath18 when there is no heat bath ( i.e. , for @xmath15 ) , the equation of motion is completely separable in these variables : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "thus we see that in this case this system is completely integrable , and the total momentum @xmath21 is a conserved quantity .    in the following sections , we study this system analytically to elucidate the relaxational behavior in certain limits .",
    "the results of numerical simulations of some models are given in  5 and  6 .",
    "in this section we consider ( 2 ) in the underdamped limit , i.e. with a small value of @xmath11 . with the presence of this weak damping term ,",
    "the total energy @xmath13 and total momentum @xmath21 , which are conserved quantities for @xmath22 , become slow variables .",
    "let us consider the situation in which the system is initially far from equilibrium , with very large @xmath23 .",
    "the rotation of @xmath24 , accordingly , is much faster than its change due to dissipation .",
    "then , the terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 in ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) change so fast that their effects on the dynamics of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are averaged out over a time scale relevant for these slower variables .",
    "here we have to distinguish the orders of characteristic time scales .",
    "we have the following relations : ( the time scale of @xmath6 ) @xmath29 ( the time scale of rotation @xmath30 ) @xmath29 ( the time scale of relaxation @xmath31 ) .",
    "now , we introduce a slower time scale @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 , and consider averages over this time scale , @xmath34 . using variables averaged over this time scale ,",
    "the mode of fast rotation is eliminated .",
    "the equations of motion for the slow time scale are obtained by integrating ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42-function here is defined with respect to the time scale @xmath32 .    in the limit @xmath43 ,",
    "the averaged variables can simply be replaced by their uniform averages over @xmath24 , defined generally by @xmath44 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 for periodic potentials .",
    "then , as the lowest - order estimation in this limit , we have @xmath47 starting in a state far from equilibrium with large values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "beginning in such a state , after a time scale of @xmath50 , the first element approaches thermal equilibrium ( @xmath51 ) , while , within this lowest - order approximation , the second element continues to satisfy @xmath52 and does not evolve toward equilibrium .    to observe the relaxation process of the second element , we need the next order estimation . since @xmath53 is finite and can depend on @xmath24 , in general the value of a time - averaged variable @xmath54 deviates from that of the corresponding phase - averaged variable @xmath55 .",
    "we now derive the correction to the equations of motion that this deviation introduces to first order in @xmath56 , and thereby obtain the relaxational equations for the second element and the total energy @xmath13 .",
    "after the exponential decay derived by ( [ eqn : decay ] ) occurring on a time scale @xmath50 , @xmath27 is approximately equal to its equilibrium value while @xmath28 is still large .",
    "then the relations @xmath57 hold , where @xmath21 is the total momentum of the system and is large enough for the fast rotational motion of the second element to be maintained . from ( [ eqn : order ] )",
    ", we straightforwardly obtain @xmath58 .",
    "the total energy @xmath13 of the system can then be expressed by the variables @xmath21 , @xmath24 and @xmath27 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are much smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 is sufficiently large and @xmath11 is sufficiently small , @xmath13 and @xmath21 are almost conserved over the time scale @xmath32 . to consider the slow evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath21 , we eliminate the fast variable @xmath24 , using the time averaged variables @xmath54 . within the slow time scale , the value of @xmath13",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is approximated by @xmath67 on the time scale @xmath68 . from the relation between ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eqn : meanh ] ) , the value of @xmath69 is estimated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the last expansion is valid if the conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are satisfied .",
    "the momenta of the two elements are then given by @xmath74 this result reveals that both elements oscillate rapidly around their averages @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we see that the amplitude of oscillation becomes smaller as the second element rotates faster ( i.e. , for larger @xmath28 and @xmath21 ) .    in order to obtain the relaxation equation for @xmath13",
    ", we substitute ( [ eqn : p1-u ] ) into ( [ eqn : relax - e ] ) . by considering only the case with a sufficiently low temperature , and neglecting terms of @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79 this equation includes fast variables , while the total energy @xmath13 is a slow variable .",
    "it is thus appropriate to average out the fast change in this equation .",
    "doing so , we obtain @xmath80 by using ( [ eqn : langevin - u ] ) . to first order in @xmath56",
    ", we can replace the time average of @xmath81 by the cycle average @xmath82 : @xmath83 applying this approximation , we obtain @xmath84    since @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , ( [ eqn : under - e-2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath88 : @xmath89 this equation describes the relaxation to thermal equilibrium for the second element .",
    "to consider only the long - time ( @xmath90 ) behavior at the current order of approximation , it can be written as @xmath91      when @xmath92 , @xmath6 vanishes , and @xmath75 is negligible ( or , more precisely speaking , it is @xmath93 )",
    ". then we obtain the following relations from ( [ eqn : phi ] ) and ( [ eqn : p1-u ] ) @xmath94 the relaxation equation for the total energy @xmath13 , ( [ eqn : under - e-2 ] ) , is then simplified as @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( that is @xmath97 ) .",
    "the relaxation equation for the second element is now given by @xmath98 these relaxation equations reveal that a coupled system in partial contact with a heat bath exhibits non - exponential , slow relaxation after excitation to a high - energy state . indeed , from ( [ eqn",
    ": under - e-0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : under - p-0 ] ) , the form of relaxation is obtained as @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the initial total energy and momentum of the second element at @xmath102 , which is defined as a time at which the first element reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , the characteristic time @xmath103 for the relaxation of @xmath28 is given by @xmath104 with an increase in the injected energy ( or momentum ) , the relaxation time increases in proportion to @xmath105 . this increase is slower than the @xmath106 form obtained from the boltzmann - jeans conjecture @xcite , but even here , there is a rapid increase of @xmath103 with the injected energy . comparing the characteristic time ( [ eqn : result-0 ] ) to that of the standard dissipation processes exhibited by systems in full contact with a heat bath ( where @xmath107 )",
    ", it is confirmed that partial contact indeed results in long - time relaxation behavior .      using the expression ( [ eqn : under - p2 - 3 ] )",
    ", we derive a relaxation equation for finite temperature . the solution of ( [ eqn : under - p2 - 3 ] )",
    "can be written @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "we next take an ensemble average ( indicated by @xmath110 ) of ( [ eqn : under - sol ] ) , in order to see the averaged behavior for the long - time profile of the relaxation .",
    "although the ensemble average of the third term , @xmath111 , can not necessarily be decomposed into the product of the average of each quantity , such a decomposition is valid at the current order of approximation , as discussed in appendix 1 .",
    "hence we get @xmath112 since @xmath113 for @xmath114 , this result leads to @xmath115 thus the relaxations of the mean values of @xmath116 and @xmath117 exhibit the same forms as these in the case with @xmath92 .",
    "the validity of the approximations used to obtain these forms have been confirmed numerically , as discussed in  5 , where ( [ eqn : under - e - sol - av ] ) to be valid over a sufficiently long interval .",
    "furthermore , we can approximate the evolution of the variance of @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) around the mean value , @xmath118 where we have again used the decomposition discussed in appendix 1 .",
    "if the time @xmath35 is not too large , this variance can be approximated by @xmath119 this form for the increase of the variance has also be shown to agree with numerical results , as discussed in  5 .    from ( [ eqn : under - e - sol - av ] ) , we obtain the mean relaxation time @xmath120 as @xmath121 we thus find that the value of the temperature has little effect on the nature of the relaxation from a high - energy state , as long as the temperature is sufficiently small .",
    "when the dissipation is sufficiently large , the inertial force can be neglected . in this overdamped limit , the equations of motion ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) can be written @xmath122 then , for sufficiently large @xmath11 , the equation for the energy dissipation is obtained straightforwardly as @xmath123 where @xmath124 . solving this equation",
    ", we have @xmath125 with the initial energy @xmath100 at @xmath102 .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath126 .",
    "in other words , that in which the time scale of dissipation from the first element is much faster than the rapid rotation of the second element . here",
    ", we are interested in relaxation from a high - energy state ( with very large @xmath49 ) taking place over a much longer time scale than the rotation time ( @xmath127 ) . in this case",
    ", the integration over time can be approximated by the cycle average : @xmath128 by using this approximation , ( [ eqn : over - e - sol ] ) can be replaced by @xmath129 an intuitive explanation for this approximation is as follows : in the limit @xmath130 , the change of @xmath24 is expected to be uniform in time",
    ". then relaxation on the slower time scale can be approximated by using the uniform average of @xmath131 over @xmath24 , to lowest order in @xmath31 and @xmath132 .",
    "for @xmath92 , there is no random force , and the relaxation is obtained directly as @xmath133 since @xmath113 , this leads to relaxation of the second element given by @xmath134 in which @xmath101 is the initial momentum .    from ( [ eqn : over - p2 - 0 ] ) , the characteristic time @xmath103 for the relaxation is obtained as @xmath135 thus in the present case , the dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath101 is different from that in the underdamped case , where @xmath136 .",
    "we remark that even in this overdamped case , the relaxation is much slower than in the case of full contact with the heat bath ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the crossover between the two limiting cases is discussed on the basis of numerical computations in  6 .",
    "taking an ensemble average of ( [ eqn : over - e - sol2 ] ) , we consider the relaxation of the mean value of @xmath13 : @xmath138 here @xmath139 has been decomposed as @xmath140 , as is justified at the present order of approximation . this relation can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "the quantity @xmath131 changes due to the brownian motion of @xmath24 in a manner that is independent of @xmath13 , because the dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath13 appears only at a higher order of @xmath141 . equation ( [ eqn : over - e - sol - av ] ) leads to an equation for the relaxation of the second element : @xmath142 it is noted that this form is independent of the temperature of the heat bath .",
    "fluctuations around the average relaxation path , which depend on the temperature , can be straightforwardly estimated from ( [ eqn : over - e - sol2 ] ) as follows : @xmath143 thus , the distribution of @xmath13 becomes broader with time , and this variance is proportional to the temperature @xmath12 of the heat bath .",
    "the results represented by ( [ eqn : over - e - sol - av ] ) and ( [ eqn : over - e - var ] ) agree well with the numerical results given in  5 .    the ensemble average for the relaxation time @xmath103 is obtained from eq.([eqn : over - e - sol - av ] ) @xmath144 this is again independent of the temperature .",
    "thus the discussion given in  4.1 is also valid at finite temperature .",
    "in this section , we check the validity of our analytical approximations , using results obtained by numerically integrating the langevin equation ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) directly . in order to demonstrate the generality of our results",
    ", we adopted three forms of the potential @xmath145 with @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) : @xmath148 here , @xmath149 is the golden mean @xmath150 , and the parameter @xmath151 represents the steepness of the potential @xmath152 . @xmath153 and @xmath152 are periodic functions with period @xmath3 , while @xmath154 is quasi - periodic with two incommensurate frequencies .",
    "@xmath152 possesses a steeper form as @xmath151 increases , and it approaches a train of @xmath42-functions with period @xmath3 as @xmath155 .",
    "we set @xmath156 to realize a sufficiently steep shape of the potential .",
    "the values of @xmath157 and @xmath158 are given in table i for each potential form .",
    "the relaxation at a finite temperature @xmath12 was studied by taking an ensemble average .",
    "we integrated ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) for almost @xmath159 samples with random seeds for each set of parameters , and thereby obtained a distribution @xmath160 of the variable @xmath161 , and thus an ensemble average @xmath162 over this distribution . for every sample in a given ensemble",
    ", we used the same initial conditions ( given below ) , and thus the differences among paths for individual samples resulted only from the effect of the random force .    in this section ,",
    "we study the scaling form for the relaxation of the total energy @xmath13 ( not @xmath28 ) by considering variations of @xmath11 , @xmath2 and @xmath12 . for this purpose",
    ", we chose an initial conditions at a given value of @xmath12 with initial energy @xmath100 as @xmath163 here , @xmath100 is a constant value , independent of @xmath12 . by using these initial conditions ,",
    "the total energy @xmath13 was evaluated with the initial energy @xmath100 for a number of temperatures , after a time to allow for the relaxation of the first element .",
    "after this relaxation , it is obtained that @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( i.e. , @xmath166 ) .",
    "we first give the numerical results for @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig : under-0 ] displays the energy relaxation for the three kinds of potentials described in table i. for the underdamped case , the values @xmath167 in table i were used for each potential . the relaxation profile obtained from the numerical experiments is fit well by @xmath168 , for @xmath169 corresponding to each potential form .",
    "thus the numerical results confirm the analytical expression ( [ eqn : under - e - sol0 ] ) .    as a next step ,",
    "we examine the relaxation process at finite temperature . in fig.[fig : under - av](a ) , ensemble averages @xmath170 are displayed as functions of time @xmath35 during the relaxation process .",
    "this figure includes numerical results from six different set - ups , using the two potential forms @xmath171 and @xmath172 each with three different temperature @xmath173 and @xmath174 . for a small time @xmath35 , the means @xmath170 exhibit the same scaling relation as in the @xmath92 case : @xmath175 .",
    "this is consistent with ( [ eqn : under - e - sol - av ] ) .",
    "as the time increases , the mean begins to deviate slightly from the line defined by ( [ eqn : under - e - sol - av ] ) . at higher temperature",

    "for this reason , we confine our study of the crossover regime to the case @xmath92 .",
    "the result we obtain here is expected to hold at a finite temperature also .",
    "recall the relaxational behavior at @xmath92 obtained for the underdamped and overdamped limit : @xmath185 here @xmath97 and @xmath96 . in appendix 2",
    ", we obtain more general approximations of @xmath27 and @xmath186 , for any values of @xmath11 and @xmath21 . here",
    "we give an intuitive description of the change in the relaxational behavior with the decrease of @xmath21 for a fixed value of @xmath11 .    the first element is driven by the second element and damped by the frictional effect of the heat bath .",
    "when @xmath11 is sufficiently small , and @xmath21 is sufficiently larger than @xmath187 , this damping due to friction is negligible , and the dynamics of the first element are approximately determined solely by its interaction with the second element .",
    "this leads to @xmath188 . from this",
    "we obtain the upper form in ( [ eqn : dissipation ] ) .",
    "as the momentum @xmath21 decreases , the interaction between the first and the second element becomes stronger , and this is accompanied by the growth of @xmath27 .",
    "due to this input of energy to the first element , it rapidly dissipates energy to the heat bath .",
    "in such a situation , the value of @xmath27 can not be estimated as @xmath189 , due to the large friction .",
    "instead , it is estimated as @xmath190 for sufficiently small values of @xmath21 .",
    "the relaxation equation in this case thus assumes the lower form in ( [ eqn : dissipation ] ) .    from the above picture",

    "the effect of the heat bath on the first element is comparable to that of the second element when the energy @xmath13 ( @xmath191 ) satisfies the condition @xmath192 . taking this into consideration ,",
    "we define the crossover energy for the relaxation behavior , @xmath193 this represents the energy at which the two relaxational forms are equal . by introducing @xmath194 defined by @xmath195 the normalized energy @xmath196 , and the normalized time @xmath197 , ( [ eqn : dissipation ] )",

    "this figure shows that the relaxation form changes smoothly between the two limiting regimes .",
    "we also remark that the nature of potential form @xmath2 seems to affect the sharpness of the crossover near @xmath204 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the relaxational behavior from a far - from - equilibrium ( highly excited ) state for a system consisting of internal and external elements in which only the external element is in contact with a heat bath . in spite of the simplicity of the model , our system exhibits a power - law - type slow relaxation when the potential is bounded , i.e. , for @xmath4 .",
    "this slow relaxation is observed when the inner part of the system is excited to a high - energy state , with energy much greater than @xmath205 . the slow relaxation of the internal part results from its indirect contact with the heat bath . in spite of the system s contact with the heat bath , guaranteeing its approach to equilibrium , the observed",
    "slow relaxation is in a strong contrast with the rapid exponential decay exhibited by systems in full contact with a heat bath .",
    "we therefore find that a hamiltonian system in partial contact with a heat bath can maintain its own internal dynamics for a much longer time than one in full contact with a heat bath .",
    "if a system has an internal part further separated from the heat bath , the hamiltonian dynamics of this part can be preserved much longer .",
    "suppose the momentum of the second element @xmath28 is constant in time",
    ". then the present model becomes @xmath206 .",
    "the brownian motion of a particle in a periodic potential @xmath60 in thermal equilibrium has been analyzed using the fokker - planck equation for this model @xcite in the contexts of josephson tunneling junction @xcite , super - ionic conductors @xcite , and two - mode lasers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we are interested in the autonomous relaxation of @xmath28 from a highly excited state , through the internal dynamics obeying ( [ eqn : langevin ] ) .",
    "this autonomous change of @xmath28 , due to the internal dynamics of the composite system , brings about slow relaxation characterized by power laws , even though the system is neither subject to special conditions , such as being placed at a phase transition point , nor exists in a glassy state involving many degrees of freedom .",
    "while our interest in hamiltonian systems in partial contact with a heat bath originates in our desire to gain an understanding of the long - term maintenance of high - energy states , such systems have also been studied in relationship with thermal conduction @xcite , for example , in the situation that two ends of a chain are in contact with two heat baths at different temperatures . according to several simulations performed on systems of this type , the fourier law of thermal conduction is not always obeyed .",
    "it appears that certain conditions concerning the internal dynamics , as well as a suitable relation of the system with the heat baths , are required in addition to ergodicity ( or mixing ) , in order for the fourier law to be obeyed .",
    "these studies also suggest that parts of systems in indirect contact with heat baths can maintain over extended periods of time the characteristic dynamics of isolated hamiltonian systems .    in a class of hamiltonian systems in the absence of a heat bath , very slow relaxation to equilibrium",
    "was suggested in the form of the ` boltzmann - jeans conjecture ' @xcite , and such behavior was reported in refs .",
    "long - term storage of a large amount of energy within a degree of freedom through this mechanism has also been studied in a hamiltonian system with chaotic behavior @xcite , in which localized energy is transferred to other degrees of freedom only after a very long time . in that case",
    ", the energy dissipates logarithmically in time .",
    "we have reported in this paper that situations exist in which localized energy in a system dissipates slowly , according to power laws , and that long - term energy storage is possible even if the system is integrable and in contact with a heat bath . from this point of view , our result can be regarded as an extension of the boltzmann - jeans conjecture to include dissipation , while the relaxational behavior itself is modified from the logarithmic form of the boltzmann - jeans conjecture . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", long - term energy storage has been reported in some protein molecules @xcite , and the relevance of this storage to molecular motors ( for muscle contraction ) has been discussed .",
    "to apply the present ideas regarding slow relaxation to proteins , we need to examine relaxation from a high - energy states for a system with more degrees of freedom .",
    "this problem will be studied in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the main question to be addressed is whether the relaxational behavior exhibits a power - law - form or a logarithmic form when hamiltonian systems more complex than that considered in the present study are in partial contact with a heat bath .",

    "in this appendix , an expression for the ensemble average @xmath207 is derived from ( [ eqn : under - p2 - 3 ] ) . since",
    "this equation is a langevin equation with multiplicative noise , the drift term of the corresponding fokker - planck equation is not necessarily @xmath208 .",
    "we carry out the kramers - moyal expansion @xcite for the evolution of the variable @xmath209 to obtain the fokker - planck equation for the probability @xmath210 in the form @xmath211 . computing straightforwardly from ( [ eqn : under - p2 - 3 ] ) , we obtain the drift term @xmath212 and the diffusion term @xmath213 where the second term of @xmath214 comes from the multiplicative noise .",
    "since we confine our study to the situation with sufficiently large @xmath28 and sufficiently small @xmath12 , this second term of @xmath214 can be ignored .",
    "thus we have @xmath215 to the order of approximation of the current analysis .",
    "hence , the ensemble average @xmath216 can be decomposed as @xmath217 .",
    "in this appendix , we give another derivation of the relaxation equation and a more precise expression of the crossover condition at @xmath92 . solving the equation of motion for the first element ( @xmath218 ) , we obtain @xmath219 we write the periodic potential @xmath60 as a fourier series : @xmath220 where we assume @xmath221 without loss of generality . then , assuming that @xmath222 , ( [ eqn : sol1-appendix ] ) can be written , @xmath223 here @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the @xmath226th components of the expressions in ( [ eqn : fourier ] ) .",
    "this solution implies that @xmath227 and @xmath228 these equations are equivalent to those obtained in  6 , but in the presents derivation , the crossover condition is more explicitly represented as @xmath229 . since @xmath230 , this crossover condition can be expressed as @xmath231 which is consistent with the condition discussed in  6 .",
    "one might think that for any part of a protein molecule , the remaining parts play a role of a heat bath , since the molecule has always large degrees of freedom .",
    "this is not always the case , or even if it is true , the ` heat bath ' there can not be regarded as a random process without any structure .",
    "it is known that a class of hamiltonian systems with large degrees of freedom exhibits spatially or temporally correlated motion .",
    "indeed , there appears some order such as clustered motion @xcite , or some part , highly excited , can be isolated from the other part with very slow relaxation @xcite .",
