    "the top quark is currently known from direct production at the fermilab tevatron to weigh @xmath8gev  @xcite , and an increase in precision to about @xmath9gev is expected soon from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . from a threshold scan of the @xmath10",
    "cross section at the planned international linear collider ( ilc ) , however , a precision of @xmath11mev can be achieved experimentally  @xcite . aside from determining a fundamental parameter of the standard model , accurate top - mass measurements constrain the quantum fluctuations from non - standard interactions in electroweak precision measurements . other characteristics of the top quark such as its width and yukawa coupling provide information about its coupling to other particles and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . for these reasons ( and perhaps also because it represents the cleanest non - relativistic system bound by the colour force ) top - quark pair production near threshold in @xmath12 annihilation has been thoroughly investigated following the non - relativistic approach of  @xcite , which treats the leading colour - coulomb force exactly to all orders in perturbation theory . in this framework , where the strong coupling @xmath13 is of the same order as @xmath14 , the small relative velocity of the top and anti - top , next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections have been available for some time  @xcite , next - to - leading and some higher - order logarithms of @xmath14",
    "have been summed to all orders  @xcite , and the third - order ( nnnlo ) cross section is now known almost completely  @xcite , which requires input from three - loop matching coefficients  @xcite , potentials  @xcite , and third - order s - wave energy levels and residues  @xcite .",
    "the full nnnlo result should finally clarify the question whether the qcd corrections can be calculated with the required precision .",
    "here we focus on a different issue , non - resonant production of the physical final state after top decay , which though known for some time ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) has been left aside up to now .",
    "the top quark is unstable with a significant width @xmath15 of about @xmath16gev due to the electroweak interaction .",
    "the width is essential in threshold production , since it prevents the top and anti - top from forming a bound state  @xcite and causes a broad resonance structure in the energy dependence of the cross section on top of the increase due to the opening - up of the two - particle phase space .",
    "however , once the top width is included , due to top decay , the physical final state is @xmath17  at least if we neglect the decay of top into strange and down quarks , as justified by @xmath18 , and consider @xmath19 bosons as stable , which we may assume for the purpose of discussion in the present paper .",
    "the @xmath17 final state can be reached through non - resonant top production or background processes containing no or only single top quarks .",
    "both effects are not included in the non - relativistic treatment . adopting a standard counting scheme where @xmath20",
    ", we find that the leading non - resonant and off - shell effects are next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for the total cross section , since there is an additional power of @xmath21 but no phase - space suppression , hence the relative correction is @xmath22 .",
    "we note that some of the higher - order nnlo corrections due to the finite top width have already been calculated in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the complete nlo `` electroweak '' contributions to the @xmath23 process in the @xmath3 resonance region , for the total cross section as well as including invariant - mass cuts on the @xmath24 pairs .",
    "the calculation is performed with unstable - particle effective field theory  @xcite , which provides the framework for consistently including resonant and non - resonant effects while maintaining an expansion in the small parameters of the problem .",
    "there are many similarities with @xmath19-pair production considered in  @xcite , though the top - quark case is technically more complicated due to the presence of a massive particle ( the @xmath19 boson ) in top decay .",
    "we note that an alternative approach has been developed in parallel  @xcite that includes the effects of invariant - mass cuts on the @xmath24 pairs entirely through calculations in non - relativistic effective theory .",
    "this works if the invariant - mass cuts around @xmath25 are neither very loose nor very tight , and provided that the non - resonant background processes are small , which must be checked by other means .",
    "the present approach removes both these restrictions and can be used in particular for the total cross section .",
    "we shall see that when both approaches are applicable , they agree well for top - quark production",
    ".    there is an interesting conceptual issue concerning the pure qcd calculation of the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "it exhibits an uncanceled ultraviolet divergence ( here regularized dimensionally ) @xmath26 at nnlo , which arises from the logarithmic overall divergence in the two - loop non - relativistic correlation function , whose imaginary part gives the cross section .",
    "the overall divergence is polynomial in the non - relativistic energy @xmath27 of the top quarks , but contributes to the cross section , since the correlation function is evaluated at complex values @xmath28 . as discussed in @xcite this divergence cancels with an infrared divergence that appears in the non - resonant term in unstable - particle effective theory from the diagram corresponding to off - shell top - quark decay .",
    "the lesson from this is that the pure qcd result alone that is usually shown in the literature is inconsistent theoretically and must be embedded in the systematic calculation of the @xmath23 process . in the present paper , however , we are concerned with nlo accuracy , where no explicit divergence arises in dimensional regularization .",
    "but the problem at nlo is in fact worse .",
    "inspection of the one - loop non - relativistic correlation function shows that it is linearly ultraviolet divergent , or more generally exhibits a cut - off dependence of the nlo order , just as the non - resonant contribution that we calculate below has a linear infrared divergence .",
    "both require regularization and as usual dimensional regularization yields finite ( but regularization - dependent ) values in four dimensions for linearly divergent integrals .",
    "the conclusion is that the non - resonant nlo contribution that we consider here is mandatory to obtain a regularization - independent result for top anti - top production , more precisely @xmath17 production in the @xmath3 threshold region , at nlo .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : method ] we briefly review unstable - particle effective theory .",
    "we list the terms that contribute at nlo to the @xmath23 process , when counting @xmath29 , and explain that the non - resonant electroweak contribution is obtained from the @xmath30 amplitude and its charge - conjugate with the top - quark width set to zero . the computation is described and the results are summarized in section  [ sec : nonresonant ] and appendix  [ sec : appendix ] . in section  [ sec : invmasscuts ] we discuss the implementation of invariant - mass cuts in the effective - theory calculation and validate our result by comparing it to the born cross section for the @xmath31 process computed numerically with madgraph / madevent .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : results ] we combine the new non - resonant contributions with the resummed leading - order qcd result and the electromagnetic correction due to the electromagnetic coulomb potential , which constitutes another electroweak nlo effect , and discuss the top anti - top line - shape as seen in the energy - dependence of the physical @xmath17 final state compared to the pure qcd calculation of @xmath3 production .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath23 process ( inclusive but also in the case where we allow for cuts in the invariant masses of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 subsystems ) is obtained from the @xmath32 cuts of the @xmath0 forward - scattering amplitude . in the energy region",
    "@xmath33 close to the top anti - top production threshold , the amplitude is dominated by the production of resonant top quarks with small virtuality .",
    "this allows us to integrate out hard modes with scale @xmath25 and represent the forward - scattering amplitude as the sum of two terms  @xcite , @xmath34 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the subsequent discussion of top - quark pair production near threshold we follow closely the formalism described in  @xcite for four - fermion production in @xmath12 collisions in the energy region of the @xmath19-pair production threshold , and refer to that paper for further details on the method .    the matrix elements in ( [ eq : master ] )",
    "are evaluated in the `` low - energy '' effective theory , which includes elements of soft - collinear and non - relativistic effective theory .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : master ] ) describes the production of a resonant @xmath3 pair in terms of production ( decay ) operators @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) with short - distance coefficients @xmath37 .",
    "the second term accounts for the remaining non - resonant contributions .",
    "note that there is no separate term for the production of one resonant and one off - shell top  @xcite , since such configurations are not sensitive to the particular low - energy dynamics that develops at the pair - production threshold .",
    "they are effectively short - distance and included in the coefficient functions @xmath38 of non - resonant production - decay operators @xmath39 .    the standard pure qcd calculation of top - pair production near threshold is entirely contained in the resonant term .",
    "in this paper we are mainly concerned with the calculation of the leading contribution to @xmath38 , which represents an nlo correction to the forward - scattering amplitude @xmath40 , since the first term in ( [ eq : master ] ) is of order @xmath41 , while the second is @xmath42 . nevertheless , for comparison and to discuss other nlo non - qcd effects",
    ", we briefly summarize the expressions relevant to the leading - order resonant term .",

    "we drop the wilson lines required to make the operators gauge - invariant , since they do not contribute to our calculation .",

    "( the dependence on @xmath71 and the regularization drops out in @xmath73 . )    the leading contribution from non - resonant production - decay operators @xmath74 to ( [ eq : master ] ) arises from four - electron operators of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 are dirac matrices .",
    "the calculation of the short - distance coefficients @xmath78 is performed in standard fixed - order perturbation theory in the full electroweak theory . in particular ,",
    "the top propagator is the free propagator not including the top width , which ensures that the amplitude depends only on the short - distance scales .",
    "self - energy insertions are treated perturbatively and are not resummed into the propagators . the leading contribution to",
    "the forward - scattering amplitude arises from the one - loop diagrams with two top propagators . just as in the case of @xmath19-boson pair production",
    "@xcite the imaginary part of these diagrams vanishes in dimensional regularization to all orders in the expansion in @xmath79 in the hard region .",
    "thus the leading imaginary parts of @xmath78 arise from two - loop diagrams of order @xmath80 shown in figure  [ fig1 ] below .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the cross section is @xmath81\\ , { \\langle e^- e^+|i { \\cal o}_{4e}^{(k)}(0)|e^- e^+ \\rangle}.\\ ] ] it is convenient not to calculate the @xmath38 separately , but directly the sum ( [ eq : nonres ] ) when one considers the unpolarized cross section .",
    "technically , this simply amounts to the calculation of the spin - averaged tree - level processes @xmath82 and @xmath83 with no width supplied to the intermediate top - quark propagators . instead ,",
    "the divergence from the top - quark propagators going on - shell is regularized dimensionally .      in the following we list the nlo corrections to the @xmath23 process in the top anti - top resonance region @xmath33 .",
    "we do not discuss in this paper the pure qcd nlo corrections consisting of the one - loop qcd correction to the @xmath84 vertex and the one - loop correction to the qcd coulomb potential , since they are standard and included in the pure qcd calculations in the literature .",
    "instead we focus on nlo corrections which arise once we consider the @xmath17 final state ( as required by the top instability ) , and other electroweak effects :    * the single insertion of the ( leading - order ) electromagnetic coulomb interaction instead of the colour coulomb interaction is an nlo effect , since @xmath85 .",
    "this is trivially accounted for , including some higher - order terms , by replacing @xmath86 in ( [ coulombgf ] ) .",
    "this effect has already been studied in @xcite . *",
    "the one - loop qcd correction to the on - shell top width @xcite is also trivially included by using the one - loop corrected expression for @xmath15 in the variable @xmath65 in ( [ coulombgf ] ) .",
    "we do not discuss this effect further in this paper , however , since in the pure qcd calculation the top width is considered as an adjustable input parameter , and thus may be thought of as representing the one - loop corrected expression .",
    "* corrections coming from gluon exchange involving the bottom quarks in the final state ( qcd interference effects ) appear at nlo but vanish at nlo for the total cross section @xcite .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : invmasscuts ] that they are parametrically suppressed in the presence of invariant - mass cuts , provided the cuts are loose in the sense defined below ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since we focus on loose cuts in the final results , no calculation of interference effects is required . *",
    "non - resonant contributions start at nlo , as discussed above .",
    "they arise from the hard contributions to the born cross section for @xmath87 , which determine the matching coefficients of the four - electron production - decay operators .",
    "we calculate this contribution in section  [ sec : nonresonant ] .",
    "we should note that any three - particle final state produced through the electroweak interaction in @xmath12 annihilation contributes at nlo ( namely @xmath42 ) provided the @xmath17 final state can be reached through the resonant decay of one of the three particles with a significant branching fraction of the decaying resonance .",
    "the obvious relevant cases are @xmath88 and @xmath89 considered in section  [ sec : nonresonant ] ; others are @xmath90 for low higgs masses , when @xmath91 is the dominant decay mode , and @xmath92 , when the higgs decays resonantly to @xmath93 with a large branching fraction .",
    "the process @xmath94 with @xmath51 decaying to @xmath95 is less prominent , since the @xmath96 branching fraction is only about 15% . we do not compute these additional three - particle processes in the present paper , since they are further suppressed when invariant - mass cuts in the top anti - top signal region are applied",
    ". moreover , in a realistic analysis these contributions would be eliminated anyway by invariant - mass cuts on the resonance ( higgs or @xmath51 ) decay products .",
    "the four - electron matching coefficients @xmath97 originate from the hard contributions of the @xmath0 forward - scattering amplitude .",

    "the extraction of these imaginary parts is more conveniently performed by evaluating the relevant cuts of the hard @xmath0 forward - scattering diagrams directly .",
    "the leading contribution arises from the cut one - loop diagram with a top and anti - top propagator ; however , the hard region of this diagram vanishes in dimensional regularization to all orders in the @xmath101-expansion .    a non - zero imaginary contribution to the short - distance coefficients @xmath97 arises ,",
    "in the unitary gauge , from the cut two - loop diagrams shown in figure  [ fig1 ] expanded near threshold ( in @xmath102 ) . including cuts of the top lines is consistent with the expansion of the imaginary part of the resummed top - quark propagator in the hard region  @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath1 cross section from diagrams @xmath103@xmath104 can be interpreted as the @xmath105 pair originating from a nearly on - shell anti - top decay , while the @xmath106 pair is produced non - resonantly , either from a highly virtual top ( diagrams @xmath103@xmath107 ) , or without an intermediate top as in the truly single - resonant diagrams @xmath108@xmath104 .",
