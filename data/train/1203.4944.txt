    "for example , they frequently present interesting catalytic properties .",
    "our choice of a finite size system as target in the photoemission process simplifies the theoretical analysis , but some of our conclusions are expected to remain valid in extended systems such as metal surfaces .",
    "we consider the case where one of the atoms in the metallic cluster undergoes core - electron photoemission .",
    "we focus our attention on the combined dynamic screening of a static localized core - hole and the photoemitted electron .",
    "we show that the presence of the hole left behind affects the many - body electronic dynamics in the cluster and therefore the emission dynamics of the photoelectron . for the description of the many - body response of the valence electrons in the cluster we use time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) ",

    "the motion of the photoemitted electron is described classically .",
    "this approximation is justified , provided that typical energies of the photons are in the 100 ev range ( xuv ) , resulting in relatively high energies of the photoemitted electrons , as the ones considered here . to analyze the role of the many - body screening effects",
    "we perform calculations using various approximations for the classical trajectory of the electron , including constant velocity studies and calculations with and without direct interaction between the ejected electron and the hole left behind .",

    "the dynamic relaxation of the fermi sea after creation of a hole was analyzed in the context of x - ray photoemission by several authors @xcite . within the framework of linear response theory , noguera _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the effective interaction between the core - hole and the photoemitted electron changes continuously from a statically screened potential for low - energy electrons to a completely unscreened potential for high - energy electrons  @xcite .",
    "they also showed that the double screening of hole and electron can occur with or without creation of plasmons according to the kinetic energy of the emitted electron . here",
    "we go beyond linear theory in the description of the dynamic screening of charges in the photoemission process by using propagation of electronic wave - packets with tddft to compute the response of the valence electrons .",

    "thus , the direct interaction between the electron and the hole is not taken into account in this case .",
    "however , as we will see below , the screening of the hole still has an important influence on the energy loss by the photoemitted electron . in this case",

    "in what follows , we center our discussion on the force experienced by the photoemitted electron due to the interaction with the cluster .",
    "this force is given by eq . and allows to study important aspects of the electron density dynamics in the cluster .",
    "we study such force in the two approximations mentioned in the previous section for the motion of the ( classical ) photoemitted electron . in the first approximation ,",
    "in which the electron moves with constant velocity , we can conveniently identify the effect of the hole screening on the movement of the photoemitted electron . to quantify the effect of the dynamic screening of the hole we calculate the work performed by the force @xmath45 along the electron trajectory .",
    "this quantity is directly linked with the energy loss of the ejected particle . in the second approximation",
    ", the velocity of the electron is allowed to vary according to newton laws .",
    "this approximation might be closer to the real photoemission process .",
    "also in this case we find an important influence of the hole - screening dynamics on the force experienced by the emitted electron and , thus , on the energy loss during the photoemission process .      in the constant velocity approximation",
    ", we calculate the cluster induced force in two different cases , namely with a localized hole at the center of the cluster ( potentials in eqs . and",
    "are included in the calculations ) and without the hole ( only the potential in eq . is included ) . in this approximation the direct interaction between hole and electron is not included . in spite of this",
    ", we find that the presence of the hole modifies the electron dynamics in the cluster because there are two different charges to be screened .",
    "we have studied four na clusters ( @xmath46 ) with 20 , 58 , 106 and 556 electrons .",
    "we consider three different velocities of the photoemitted electron : 1 a.u , 1.5 a.u . and 2.5 a.u .     acting on the electron moving away from the center of the cluster ( n=20 , @xmath47=4 ) as a function of the electron position .",

    "from the present results it follows that , in the case of the presence of the hole , the cluster induced force on the photoemitted electron has positive value at short times for the two chosen velocities .",
    "this indicates that the cluster response tends to accelerate the electron at the very beginning of its movement .",
    "the repulsive cluster induced force is related to the screening of the hole .",
    "more precisely , at the beginning of its movement , when close to the hole , the electron is repelled from the hole vicinity by the cluster electrons that arrive to screen the hole . when the hole is not included in the calculation , the above effect is not observed and the emitted electron is mainly decelerated all along its trajectory  @xcite .",
    "this deceleration is due to two effects .",
    "first , within the cluster , the electron suffers the stopping characteristic of any charged particle moving in an electron gas  @xcite .",
    "second , as the electron approaches the cluster surface , we can clearly see the contribution to the forces associated with overcoming the surface potential step .",
    "these two decelerating contributions are difficult to disentangle for very small clusters , like those in the main panels of figure  [ force-1st ] .",
    "however , the force experienced by a particle moving inside a large jellium cluster reaches a stationary regime and oscillates around a mean value .",
    "this can be seen in the inset of figure  [ force-1st ]  ( a ) for a cluster containing 556 electrons .",
    "the mean value of the force is the so - called stopping power and only depends on the electron density . in our case , for @xmath49=4 , is around 0.055 a.u . for a negatively charged particle moving with a velocity of 1 a.u .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the influence of the hole screening on the moving electron can be better analyzed if we look at the difference of forces shown in the figure  [ force-1st ] : @xmath52 . here , @xmath53",

    "vertical dashed lines correspond to the radii of the clusters .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as it is seen from the graphs , the effect of the screening of the hole is larger in the case of the smaller electron velocity 1 a.u .",
    "- figure  [ fig : dforce](a ) .",
    "this is related to the time that the photoelectron spends in the neighborhood of the hole and to the characteristic time of the hole screening .",
    "the slow photoelectron stays near the hole long enough for the screening of the hole to be performed .",
    "therefore , it experiences a large force due to the piling up of electronic charge around the hole .",
    "the fast electron , however , leaves the hole at short times , which are not enough for a significant piling up of screening charge .",
    "hence , the effect associated with the hole screening becomes smaller the higher the electron velocity .",
    "it is worth noting that , for the slow electron , @xmath55 is almost identical for the two largest clusters considered here and it is very small for @xmath59  a.u .",
    "both observations indicate that the screening of the hole is well established and basically reaches its stationary value at the corresponding time scale . for the faster electron",
    ", however , the value of @xmath55 at large @xmath60 is different for different cluster radii .",
    "this is linked to the time - evolution of the screening density which still goes on by the time the electron reaches the cluster boundary .",
    "these conclusions are corroborated by the induced electron density dynamics plots ( figure  [ fig : dens - z - t - cont ] ) discussed below .    in order to quantify the effect of the hole screening , we calculate the electron energy loss due to the interaction with the cluster electrons for the case of @xmath61 and for the velocities 1 a.u , 1.5 a.u . , and 2.5 a.u . of the photoemitted electron .",
    "the energy loss @xmath35 , given by eq .  , is defined as the work performed by the cluster induced force acting on the moving electron .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ loss ] , in which the difference in the cluster induced energy loss @xmath62 , with and without the hole , is also shown .",
    "cc|c|c|c|l & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + & & 0.60 & 0.44 & 0.22 + & & 0.37 & 0.30 & 0.16 + & 0.23 & 0.14 & 0.06 +    [ loss ]    the presence of the hole reduces the cluster induced energy loss for all velocities .",
    "the value of @xmath62 also shows that the effect of the hole screening is more significant the slower the electron . the energy loss of the electron moving at 1 a.u",
    ". decreases almost by a factor of 2 when we include the hole screening in the process .",
    "an interesting consequence is that , at low velocities , the effects associated with the hole screening might become crucial to determine if the photoemission process can indeed take place or not .",
    "for example , the kinetic energy of the slowest electron considered in table  [ loss ] is 0.5 a.u .. since the energy loss in the case without hole is 0.6 a.u .",
    ", this electron can not be photoemitted from the cluster .",
    "however , in the presence of the hole the photoemission becomes possible .",
    "the study of the electron dynamics during photoemission in the constant velocity approximation leads us to two conclusions : 1 ) the screening of the hole by the cluster electrons leads to a repulsive ( accelerating ) force acting on the photoemitted electron at the beginning of its movement ; 2 ) the effect of the hole screening is reduced for faster ( more energetic ) photoemitted electrons .",
    "the results discussed so far are obtained using a simple model in which the photoemitted electron moves with a constant velocity . in a real photoemission process , however , the velocity varies due to the different elastic and inelastic forces acting on the electron . in order to be sure that none of the effects discussed above is an artifact of the model and to prove our conclusions",
    ", we simulate the photoemission process in a more realistic second approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the velocity and coordinate of the electron are dependent on time , according to equations , , and .",
    "electron and hole interact via a regularized coulomb potential .",
    "acting on the electron moving away from the center of the cluster ( n=20 , @xmath46 ) , as a function of the electronic position in three cases : 1 ) there is no hole at the center of the cluster and the initial velocity of the electron is 1.5 a.u .",
    "( green line ) ; 2 ) there is a hole at the center of the cluster , but the photoemitted electron does not interact directly with the hole .",
    "the initial velocity of the electron is 1.5 a.u .",
    "( red line ) ; 3 ) there is a hole at the center of the cluster and a direct electron - hole interaction ( eq .",
    "[ e - h - int ] ) is included .",
    "the initial velocity of the electron is 2.25 a.u .",
    "( red line ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the radius of the cluster , @xmath51 a.u.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in figure  [ force-2nd ] we show the results for the small cluster with 20 electrons in this varying velocity approximation .",
    "the force felt by the moving electron due to the interaction with the cluster electrons [ eq .  ]",
    "is calculated for three different cases . in the first case",
    ", we do not include the hole in the cluster . in the second case , there is a hole to be screened , but we do not include the direct interaction between the hole and the photoelectron when performing the trajectory calculation . in the third case , the direct interaction between photoelectron and hole is included .",
    "in the first two situations , the initial velocity of the electron is set to 1.5 a.u , while in the third situation is set to 2.25 a.u .",
    "this difference in velocity corresponds to the energy of the electron - hole interaction . indeed , with the parameter @xmath43 a.u .",
    "used here in eq .",
    ", the  binding energy \"  @xcite of the electron is around 1.4 a.u . taking into account this binding energy , the initial velocity 2.25 a.u . for an electron photoemitted in vacuum and interacting with the hole",
    "leads to a final velocity @xmath66  1.5  a.u .",
    "therefore , our choice of initial velocities allows a direct comparison of the two cases , with and without direct electron - hole interaction in the case of photoemission inside the cluster .",
    "one can see from figure  [ force-2nd ] that the behavior of the cluster induced force in this more realistic model is similar to that of the simple model considered before ( figure  [ force-1st ] ) .",
    "whenever the hole screening is taken into account , there is an acceleration force acting on the electron at the beginning of its trip .",
    "similarly to the constant velocity approximation , performing calculations along a more realistic trajectory with different launch velocities , we also found that the effect of the hole screening decreases when the initial velocity of the electron increases .",
    "moreover , we found that the cluster induced force is very similar independently on whether electron and hole directly interact with each other or not .",
    "however , this is valid only if the final velocity of the photoemitted electron interacting with the hole is equal to the final velocity of the electron not interacting with the hole .",
    "this shows that , as far as the final energy of the photoemitted electron is the same , the cluster induced force acting on the photoemitted electron is mainly affected by the presence or absence of the hole screening and not by the details of the electron trajectory nearby the hole .",
    "continuing the discussion on the electron density dynamics in the cluster , we illustrate the effect of the coupling of both processes  dynamic screening of the hole and dynamic screening of the moving electron .",

    "similarly , @xmath80 is the tddft result for the induced electron density in response to a photoelectron moving from its center , where no hole is present .",
    "therefore , panel ( b ) shows a linear superposition of the electronic charges screening the static hole and the moving photoelectron . in the inset of both graphs",
    "we show the time evolution of the electronic density at a given point ( @xmath72=0.02 a.u . , @xmath24=0.2 a.u .",
    "the white area in the main plots shows a depletion of the electronic density in the cluster that roughly follows the trajectory of the electron .",
    "it is due to the coulomb repulsion between the moving electron and the rest of the electrons in the cluster .",
    "black arrows indicate the time at which the screening of the hole is fully developed , i.e. , the induced electron density in the close vicinity of the hole roughly integrates to one .",
    "this time is also shown in the inset of each plot and is equal to 11 a.u . and 8 a.u . for the cases ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "thus , there is a delay in the tddft screening of the hole as compared to the linear superposition case .",
    "moreover , comparing the charge distribution for negative and positive values of @xmath24 , we can see a clear asymmetry in the screening charge for the tddft calculation with both hole and electron simultaneously included .",
    "this asymmetry is absent in panel ( b ) , corresponding to the linear superposition of electron and hole separate screenings , and clearly indicates that the dynamics of the hole screening is affected by the presence and movement of the emitted electron .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the tddft calculation , considering both the hole at the center and the electron photoemitted from the center of the cluster , includes a combined effect of the dynamic screening of both particles in the relaxation processes in the cluster .",
    "this combined effect is also visible in the oscillations of the electronic density , where the periods of these oscillations are slightly different for the two cases considered .",
    "in this study a semi - classical model was used to describe the dynamic screening of a moving photoelectron and that of the localized core - hole left behind as a result of interaction of xuv pulses with small metal clusters .",
    "the motion of the photoemitted electron is described classically and the electron dynamics in the clusters is studied using the time - dependent density functional theory , tddft .",
    "we have shown that , when the hole is explicitly included in the calculation , the photoemitted electron is accelerated by the cluster electrons that pile up nearby the cluster center to dynamically screen the hole .",
    "this effect is observed by comparing the forces acting on the photoemitted electron due to the interaction with the cluster in which a hole is present or absent at the center . in order to quantify the effect of the hole screening we have calculated the energy loss of the photoelectron .",
    "we have shown that the presence of the hole reduces significantly the cluster induced energy loss and that this effect is velocity dependent .",
    "the higher is the energy of the photoemitted electron the smaller is the effect induced by the hole screening .",
    "these conclusions were obtained using a relatively simple approximation in which the photoemitted electron moves with constant velocity .",
    "the conclusions are proven to remain valid when the interaction between photoemitted electron and core - hole left behind is included in the calculation and the velocity of the electron is allowed to vary with time .",
    "we have illustrated the time evolution of the electron density in the cluster during the photoemission process and we have shown that the tddft calculation allows us to see the coupled effect of the screening of both the hole and the electron in the relaxation processes inside the cluster .",
    "the semi - classical model used here allows for a detailed analysis of the effect of the dynamic screening of the hole .",
    "however , the simplicity of the model and the classical treatment of the photoemitted electron also prevents a direct translation of our findings to the experimental situation .",
