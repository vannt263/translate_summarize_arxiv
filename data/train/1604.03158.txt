    "the stellar population in the galactic halo is distinct from the populations in the thin and thick disks . without evidence for ongoing star formation , halo stars are in general metal - poor and hence much older than their disk counterparts .",
    "those so - called population ii stars also show peculiar kinematics .",
    "while disk stars are orbiting around the galactic center with velocities around @xmath7 for the solar neighborhood , the orbits of halo stars are more diverse , usually tilted against the disk and sometimes retrograde .",
    "the typical distribution for their three - dimensional galactic rest - frame velocities ( @xmath8 ) ranges from about @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "objects with even higher @xmath8 and peculiar kinematics are known among halo stars .",
    "runaway stars reach velocities of up to @xmath11 , while the so - called hyper - velocity stars ( hvs ) travel with velocities , that can even exceed the escape velocity of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and reach more than @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "since most of the known runaway and hvs stars are young , early - type main - sequence stars , they can not belong to the old halo population ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "those objects must have been formed in the galactic disk , accelerated , and eventually injected into the halo .",
    "however , the acceleration mechanisms still remain unclear .",
    "runaway stars might be the remnants of binary systems where the more massive component exploded as a core - collapse supernova ( sn , @xcite ) or they might have been ejected by dynamical interactions in dense star clusters .",
    "hvs stars can be generated when a close binary is disrupted by the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the center of our galaxy and one component is ejected @xcite .    a peculiar sub - population of these extreme halo stars consists of o - type and b - type hot subdwarf stars ( sdo / bs ; see @xcite for a review ) . one of those stars ( us708 , hvs2 ) turned out to be the fastest unbound star in our galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . hot subdwarfs form if the progenitor loses its envelope almost entirely after passing the red giant branch and the remaining hydrogen - rich envelope has not retained enough mass to sustain a hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "mass - transfer in a binary system is considered to be the most likely mechanism to remove the envelope and form a hot subdwarf @xcite .",
    "it is challenging to explain the acceleration of such stars to high velocities , because the most plausible scenarios are only able to explain the acceleration of single stars .",
    "@xcite explained the extreme velocity of us708 by proposing that this star is the ejected companion of a very tight binary system where the massive white dwarf primary exploded as a thermonuclear type ia sn . in this scenario",
    "mass - transfer from the hot subdwarf to the white dwarf triggered the sn explosion . since the properties of such ejected companions allow us to put constraints on the yet unknown parameters of the progenitor systems of sne ia , it is crucial to find more objects like us708 .",
    "several other hot subdwarfs with high @xmath8 have been discovered by @xcite .",
    "the fastest object in this sample is the sdb star sdssj121150.27 + 143716.2 ( also pb3877 ; here j1211 for short ) with @xmath13 , which is predominantly a tangential velocity .",
    "@xcite found j1211 to most likely be unbound to the galaxy .",
    "they traced the trajectory of this star back to the outskirts of the galactic disk and showed that this star could not have been ejected by the smbh in the galactic center .",
    "those properties made j1211 an excellent candidate for the sn ia ejection scenario and a prime target for our follow - up campaign with 8m - class telescopes .",
    "to improve the atmospheric parameters of j1211 and measure the rotational broadening of the lines , we obtained medium - resolution spectra with the esi spectrograph ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) at the keck telescope and the xshooter spectrograph ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) at the eso - vlt between 2014 june 1 and 11 .",
    "to our surprise , the better resolutions and s / ns of these spectra , compared to the sdss and eso - vlt fors1 spectra used by @xcite , immediately revealed the unseen weak lines of a cool companion in the spectrum .",
    "we performed a model atmosphere analysis and fitted the composite spectra with the steepest - descent spectral analysis program xtgrid @xcite .",
    "this fit procedure allows the separation of the members in composite spectra binaries and employs tlusty / synspec ( @xcite ; @xcite ) model atmospheres for the hot subdwarf , and atlas9 models for the cool companion .",
    "the plane - parallel , non - lte tlusty model atmospheres are calculated in a hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium that is appropriate for hot subdwarfs .",
    "our models include h , he , c , n , o and si opacities that are consistently in the model atmosphere calculations and in the spectral synthesis .",
    "xtgrid starts with an initial model and iteratively updates the parameters of the binary along the steepest - gradient of the global chi - squared ( @xmath18 ) surface .",
    "tlusty models are calculated in every iteration and the spectrum of the cool companion is regularly extracted from the bluered high - resolution synthetic stellar spectral library @xcite .",
    "the bluered grid allows to fit the temperature , gravity , and scaled - solar metallicity of the cool companion using interpolated models .",
    "the fit was based only on spectral lines because a reliable flux calibration was not available for the higher quality keck and vlt data .",
    "the best fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and the final parameters together with error bars are listed in table[tbl : one ] . for a better representation of the observed data the continuum of the keck observation was adjusted to the composite model in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "no attempt has been made to include parameter correlations in the error calculations .",
    "our fit confirmed the sdb classification of the primary and provided a k3v type main - sequence companion .",
    "the revised sdb temperature is systematically lower by @xmath192000 k , while the surface gravity and he abundance are within error bars of the previous analysis by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy originates from the different data set used in the analysis .",
    "@xcite used the sdss - i dr7 spectrum that shows significant differences compared to the sdss - iii , keck , and vlt data analyzed here .",
    "we note that the @xmath18 map of a composite spectrum model resembles a valley , or canyon , with a flat bottom due to strong correlations between the atmospheric and binary parameters .",
    "therefore , a @xmath20 k , @xmath21 cms@xmath3 or a @xmath22 k , @xmath23 cms@xmath3 solution gives only a 10% higher @xmath18 minimum .",
    "similar degeneracies have been reported in other composite spectra binaries @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to determine the orbital parameters of the binary system with the available data .",
    "we measured the radial velocities ( rvs ) of two sdss spectra taken in 2005 and 2012 , an eso - vlt fors1 spectrum taken in 2008 , seven esi spectra , and eight xshooter spectra taken in 2014 .",
    "no significant rv shift was detected over the timebase of nine years .",
    "furthermore , the rv from the spectral lines of the sdb primary closely matches the one of the k - star ; they both are shifted by @xmath24kms@xmath25 with respect to the barycentric reference frame .",
    "a chance alignment can therefore be excluded and the two components visible in the spectra indeed form a binary system .",
    "about 20 - 30% of sdb stars are in composite spectrum binaries with f - g - k type companions .",
    "the orbital periods for about a dozen of these systems could be determined only recently ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they turned out to lie between @xmath19700 and @xmath191300 days , which is consistent with the roche - lobe overflow evolution channel @xcite .",
    "stable mass transfer to the main - sequence companion most likely removed the envelope of the red giant and led to the formation of the sdb @xcite .",
    "typical rv semi - amplitudes of those binaries are smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "although the low resolution of our data did not allow us to find rv variations , the rvs of the sdb and the k - star differ by @xmath27kms@xmath25 in the coadded keck spectrum , which is consistent with such wide binaries .",
    "therefore , assuming an inclination of @xmath28 , we expect that j1211 is a typical sdb+ms binary with an orbital period of several hundred days and a separation of several au .",

    "the neglect of the companion flux and the different flux calibration of the sdss - i dr7 spectrum provided a large distance in the previous analysis .",

    "we approximated the subdwarf mass with the canonical mass of 0.48@xmath51 and used the surface gravity from spectroscopy to find the radius @xmath52 , which is a typical value for similar hot subdwarfs .",
    "next , we used the surface flux of the subdwarf model to find the absolute contribution of the companion ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "then , from the ratio of the observed flux ( @xmath54 ) and the composite model , the flux scale factor ( @xmath55 ) and the distance can be calculated : @xmath56    the different radii of the subdwarf and the cool companion are implicitly included in the composite model and set up by the fit procedure through the flux ratio .",
    "the synthetic composite spectrum based on the keck observation fits the slope of the boss spectrum well , also suggesting a relatively low reddening toward j1211 in agreement with the low interstellar extinction in its direction ( see sect .",

    "the unexpected discovery of a cool companion in a wide orbit around j1211 has severe consequences when trying to explain the extreme kinematics of this object . along with the sn ejection scenario , which predicts the ejection of a single hot subdwarf star ,",
    "essentially all other acceleration mechanisms discussed for hvs and runaway stars can be immediately excluded .",
    "a wide binary system like j1211 is too fragile to survive any kind of close encounter with another object that might lead to such an acceleration .",
    "a close encounter with a supermassive or intermediate - mass black hole would rip the binary apart .",
    "the same would happen during a dynamical interaction in a dense stellar population or could be caused by the kick of a core - collapse sn . only very close",
    "binaries might survive such interactions .",
    "a globular cluster tidal tail origin is not likely either , as it would require a high - velocity cluster , and due to the low binary fraction in globular clusters we would expect more single hvs stars to be on similar orbits than binaries",
    ".    should j1211 be unbound to the galaxy , the origin of the system is an interesting question .",
    "half of the known hvs stars concentrate in the direction of the constellation leo @xcite .",
    "j1211 is in this direction , but its velocity vector is perpendicular to those of the known early - type hvs stars , suggesting a different origin . although we could not associate j1211 with any of the known stellar streams , it may be the first evolved hvs system discovered from the tidal debris of a disrupted dwarf satellite galaxy .",
    "if j1211 has a bound orbit , it must have formed with the galaxy or accreted later . due to the extreme kinematics of the system , a bound orbit requires a massive dark matter halo , therefore j1211 is particularly well suited to probe the galactic potential and constrain the mass of the dark matter halo as described in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the kinematic properties of j1211 are most likely primordial and that the binary must be an extreme halo object , which was either born in the halo population or accreted later from the debris of a destroyed satellite galaxy .",
    "the low metallicity of the k - star companion is consistent with both scenarios .",
    "the progenitor of the sdb was most likely a main - sequence star more massive than the halo turnoff mass of about @xmath92 .",
