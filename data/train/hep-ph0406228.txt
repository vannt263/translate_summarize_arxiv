    "the charm - beauty ( @xmath1 ) quarkonium states provide a unique window into heavy quark dynamics and therefore an important test of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "although they are intermediate to the charmonium and bottomonium systems the properties of @xmath1 mesons are a special case in quarkonium spectroscopy as they are the only quarkonia consisting of heavy quarks with different flavours .",
    "because they carry flavour they can not annihilate into gluons so are more stable with widths less than a hundred kev .",
    "excited @xmath1 states lying below @xmath2 ( and @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) threshold can only undergo radiative or hadronic transitions to the ground state @xmath1 which then decays weakly .",
    "this results in a rich spectroscopy of narrow radial and orbital excitations below @xmath5 threshold which are more stable than their charmonium and bottomonium analogues : there are two sets of @xmath6-wave states , as many as two @xmath7-wave multiplets ( the 1p and some or all of the 2p ) and one @xmath8-wave multiplet below @xmath2 threshold . as well , the @xmath9-wave multiplet is sufficiently close to threshold that they may also be relatively narrow due to angular momentum barrier suppression of the zweig allowed strong decays .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath1 meson by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration @xcite in @xmath10 collisions at @xmath11  tev has demonstrated the possibility of the experimental study of this system and has stimulated considerable interest in @xmath1 spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "calculations of @xmath1 cross sections at hadron colliders predict that large samples of @xmath1 states should be produced at the tevatron and at the lhc opening up this new spectroscopy @xcite . at the tevatron",
    "it is estimated that @xmath12 @xmath1 mesons should be produced for 1  fb@xmath13 of integrated luminosity while at the lhc @xmath14 @xmath1 mesons are expected to be produced for @xmath15  fb@xmath13 .",
    "these numbers are highly sensitive to the @xmath16 and rapidity cuts used to extract the signal @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 cross sections are expected to be 50 - 100% larger than the @xmath1 cross sections @xcite and cheung and yuan @xcite predict excited p - waves to contribute 20% of inclusive @xmath1 production while d - wave states are expected to contribute about 2% @xcite .",
    "chang and chen @xcite and cheung @xcite estimate that the @xmath18 states will be produced in roughly the ratio of @xmath19 .",
    "it should therefore be possible to start exploring @xmath0 spectroscopy at the tevatron , producing the @xmath20 and @xmath18 states and possibly even some @xmath21 and @xmath22 states with sufficient rate to be observed . at the lhc , with its higher luminosity , the @xmath8-wave @xmath0 states should be produce in a sizable number so that the lhc should allow the study of the spectroscopy and decay of @xmath1 mesons .",
    "in this paper we study the spectroscopy , including radiative transitions , of charm - beauty mesons using the relativized quark model @xcite .",
    "the model includes one - gluon exchange with a running coupling constant and a linear confining potential .",
    "it uses relativistic kinematics and momentum dependent and nonlocal interactions .",
    "although this model is not a rigorous calculation from first principles it gives a good account of most known mesons and baryons with only a few free parameters @xcite so that it provides a useful guide to missing states .",
    "we compare its predictions to those of other models with the aim of highlighting which predictions are most sensitive to details of the models and therefore the most useful in distinguishing models .",
    "however , we are also interested in pointing out which predictions give the greatest agreement between models and therefore offer the most robust signatures for experiments to look for .",
    "observation of these states and measurement of their properties would provide valuable information distinguishing details of the various models .    we start with a brief outline of the relativized quark model and comment on its similarities and differences with other quark model calculations .",
    "the spectroscopic predictions are given and compared to those of other models in the literature .",
    "this is followed by predictions for e1 and m1 radiative transitions and estimates of hadronic transitions based on the kuang - yan approach @xcite .",
    "we summarize existing predictions for some of the more prominent weak decays of the @xmath1 ground state as final states are an important ingredient in reconstructing the @xmath1 mesons .",
    "in addition , leptonic decays measure the wavefunction at the origin and are therefore an additional test of the model @xcite .",
    "we end by discussing some strategies for searching for excited @xmath1 mesons and studying their spectroscopy .",
    "in this section we give the mass predictions of the relativized quark model @xcite for the charm - beauty mesons and compare those predictions with the predictions of other calculations .",
    "this model has ingredients common to many quark potential models @xcite .",
    "almost all such models are based on some variant of the coulomb plus linear potential expected from qcd .",
    "an interesting observation is that all recent models have arrived at the same slope for the linear confining potential of @xmath23  gev@xmath24 .",
    "most models , as does ours , also include the running constant of qcd , @xmath25 . and finally , relativistic effects are often included at some level .",
    "the relativized quark model has been reasonably successful in describing most known mesons .",
    "although cracks have recently appeared with the discovery of the @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 states @xcite , these point to the need to include physics which has hitherto been neglected such as coupled channel effects @xcite .    in the relativized quark model mesons",
    "are approximated by the @xmath28 sector of fock space , in effect integrating out the degrees of freedom below some distance scale , @xmath29 .",
    "this results in an effective potential , @xmath30 , whose dynamics are governed by a lorentz vector one - gluon - exchange interaction at short distance and a lorentz scalar linear confining interaction .",
    "the basic equation of the model is the rest frame schrdinger - type equation @xcite : @xmath31 \\vert \\psi \\rangle = e \\vert \\psi \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath32 the effective quark - antiquark potential , @xmath33 , was found by equating the scattering amplitude of free quarks , using a scattering kernel with the desired dirac structure , with the effects between bound quarks inside a hadron @xcite . due to relativistic effects",
    "the potential is momentum dependent in addition to being co - ordinate dependent .",
    "to first order in @xmath34 , @xmath33 reduces to the standard non - relativistic result : @xmath35 where @xmath36 includes the spin - independent linear confinement and coulomb - like interaction , @xmath37 is the colour contact interaction , @xmath38 \\ ; \\;\\ ] ] is the colour tensor interaction , @xmath39 is the spin - orbit interaction with @xmath40 its colour magnetic piece arising from one - gluon exchange and @xmath41 the thomas precession term . in these formulae @xmath42 is the running coupling constant of qcd .    to relativize the @xmath28 potential , the full dirac scattering amplitude was used as a starting point which for on - shell @xmath28 scattering is exact .",
    "however for a strongly interacting system there will in general be off - shell behavior which we did not consider in addition to other simplifications such as neglecting more complex components of fock space .",
    "we therefore built a semiquantitative model of relativistic effects by smearing the co - ordinate @xmath43 over the distances of the order of the inverse quark mass by convoluting the potential with a gaussian form factor and replacing factors of @xmath44 with , roughly speaking , factors of @xmath45 .",
    "the details of this _ relativization _ procedure and the method of solution can be found in ref .",
    "it should be kept in mind that because we neglected coupled channel effects and the crudeness of the relativization procedure we do not expect the mass predictions to be accurate to better than @xmath46  mev .    for the case of a quark and antiquark of unequal mass charge conjugation parity",
    "is no longer a good quantum number so that states with different total spins but with the same total angular momentum , such as the @xmath47 and @xmath48 pairs , can mix via the spin orbit interaction or some other mechanism .",
    "[ eqn : socm ] and [ eqn : sotp ] can be rewritten to explicitely give the antisymmetric spin - orbit mixing term : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , the physical @xmath51 @xmath7-wave states are linear combinations of @xmath52 and @xmath53 which we describe by : @xmath54 with analogous notation for the corresponding @xmath55 , @xmath9 , etc . pairs . in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] @xmath56 designates the relative angular momentum of the @xmath57 pair and the subscript @xmath58 is the total angular momentum of the @xmath57 pair which is equal to @xmath59 .",
    "our notation implicitely implies @xmath60 coupling between the quark spins and the relative orbital angular momentum . in the heavy quark limit",
    "in which the heavy quark mass @xmath61 , the states can be described by the total angular momentum of the light quark , @xmath62 , which couples to the spin of the heavy quark and corresponds to @xmath63 coupling .",
    "this limit gives rise to two doublets , one with @xmath64 and the other with @xmath65 and corresponds to two physically independent mixing angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "some authors prefer to use the @xmath63 basis @xcite but since we solve our hamiltonian equations assuming @xmath60 eigenstates and then include the @xmath68 mixing we use the notation of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] .",
    "it is straightforward to transform between the @xmath60 basis and the @xmath63 basis .",
    "it will turn out that radiative transitions are particularly sensitive to the @xmath69 mixing angle with predictions from different models in some cases giving radically different results .",
    "we also note that the definition of the mixing angles are frought with ambiguities .",
    "for example , charge conjugating @xmath0 into @xmath70 flips the sign of the angle and the phase convention depends on the order of coupling @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian problem was solved using the following parameters : the slope of the linear confining potential is 0.18 gev@xmath24 , @xmath74 gev , and @xmath75 gev .",
    "the predictions of our model are given in fig .",
    "1 and are compared to the predictions of other calculations in table [ tab : masses ] . because the mixing angles defined in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] are important for predictions of radiative transitions those predictions are also given in table [ tab : masses ] .",
    "although i have attempted to consistently give the masses and the mixing angles of the predicted eigenstates in the convention of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] , because not all authors have unambiguously defined their phase conventions i can not guaranty that these results are free of inconsistantcies .",
    "the different models are in remarkable agreement with the differences , for the most part , within the expected accuracy of the models .",
    "this almost certainly indicates how the various models have converged to using similar confining potentials and including a strong running coupling constant in the coulomb piece of the potential .",
    "the only significant difference is the larger spread ( @xmath76  mev ) for the @xmath21 multiplet centre of gravity predictions .",
    "the spin - dependent splittings are also in reasonable agreement .",
    "potential models can therefore be used as a reliable guide in searching for the @xmath1 excited states .",
    "an important difference in the predictions is that in the eichten - quigg calculation @xcite the @xmath77 states are almost pure @xmath52 and @xmath53 with little mixing while in other models there is significant mixing .",
    "this arises from the much smaller expectation value of the off - diagonal mixing term ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : somix ] ) in the eichten - quigg calculation @xcite compared to the other models . since ,",
    "after rotating from the @xmath63 basis to the @xmath60 basis , the @xmath60 mixing term given by eichten and quigg is in agreement with eqn .",
    "[ eqn : somix ] , the differences in expectation values can only be attributed to differences in the cancellations between the short and long distance pieces in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : somix ] , i.e. between the @xmath78 and @xmath79 pieces .",
    "this reflects subtle differences in the @xmath28 potentials of different models .",
    "because the e1 radiative transitions are sensitive to the @xmath80 mixing , the measurement of radiative transitions can be used to distinguish between the different models .",
    "the study of the @xmath1 spectroscopy will help test and refine the quark potential models but more importantly will test lattice qcd , nrqcd , and pnrqcd etc . which are more directly connected to qcd .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to calculate @xmath1 masses and radiative transitions in the relativized quark model . for the most part the mass predictions are consistent with other models , within the accuracy of these models .",
    "the largest discrepancy in predictions is for the triplet - singlet mixing angles .",
    "this has implications for transitions between states so can be tested with appropriate measurements . combining the br s we have calculated with @xmath1 production cross sections from the literature we see that the @xmath81 , @xmath20 , and @xmath18 states should be produced in sufficient numbers to be observed at the tevatron . with the higher statistics of the lhc , it should also be possible to observe the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states",
    ". it will be a significant experimental challenge to extract the signals for these states from the large background but their observation would add considerably to our knowledge of quarkonium spectroscopy and discriminate between the various models that exist in the literature .",
