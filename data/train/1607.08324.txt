    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous events ever known in the universe by far .",
    "traditionally , the relativistic fireball model is proposed to interpret the observational phenomenon of grbs ( mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ; kumar & zhang 2015 ) . within this scenario , the observed prompt gamma - ray emission",
    "is explained by the internal shocks ( mszros & rees 1993 ) . despite its attractive features ,",
    "the internal shock model is suffered with some severe problems , such as inefficiency problem ( kumar & zhang 2015 for a review ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the outflow is dominated by poynting flux , significant magnetic energy is dissipated to produce non - thermal emission , a fraction of the dissipated energy is converted to kinetic energy ( zhang & yan 2011 ) .",
    "after the internal dissipation , the deceleration of the jet by the ambient medium excites a long term external shock with synchrotron emission which powers the broad band afterglow emission ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; gao et al .",
    "2013 ) . in _ swift _",
    "era , the shallow decay ( or plateau ) segment is usually seen in the xrt light curves ( liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the widely discussed model for this component is energy injection into the external forward shock either from an long lasting central engine or from an ejecta with a wide distribution of lorentz factors ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand , in rare cases",
    ", x - ray plateaus of long grbs can be followed by a very steep decay ( e.g. @xmath11 ; grb 070110 , troja et al .",
    "2007 ; l & zhang 2014 ) for temporal and spectral power law models . ] , and in some short grbs as well ( rowlinson et al . 2010 , 2013 ; l et al . 2015 ) , which called an @xmath0internal plateau@xmath1 ( lyons et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this is more difficult to be explained by standard external afterglow fireball model , and an internal dissipation process need to be invoked ( fan & xu 2006 ) . from theoretical point of view , such behavior could be naturally explained when a rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized neutron star called @xmath0millisecond magnetar@xmath1 being invoked as the central engine of grb ( dai & lu 1998a , b ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; gao & fan 2006 ; metzger et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the internal plateau feature is also @xmath0smoking gun@xmath1 signature for magnetar collapsing into black hole ( kumar & zhang 2015 for review ) .    previous work have shown that rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized ns could produce both prompt emission and later plateau of afterglow with proper parameters ( usov et al .",
    "1992 ) . under this framework ,",
    "two different physical process are proposed to produce grb jet .",
    "one is that a new - born neutron star surrounded by hyper - accreting and neutrino cooling disk , which is similar to disk cooling of black hole central engine via neutrino annihilation ( zhang & dai 2008 , 2009 ; lei et al .",
    "2009 , 2013 ) , but the structure of a hyper - accretion disk may be different .",
    "zhang & dai ( 2008 , 2009 ) divide the disk of neutron star into two regions ( e.g. inner and outer disks ) , and studied physical properties of disk structure .",
    "the grb hot jet can be powered by neutrino annihilation following the spin axis .",
    "later , the magnetar would release its rotation energy via magnetic dipole radiation to produce the observational plateau in x - ray afterglow .",
    "alternative , a differentially rotating millisecond pulsar was formed due to different angular velocity between the interior core and outer shell parts of the neutron star .",
    "it wind up toroidal magnetic fields to about @xmath12 g , and release the corresponding magnetic energy via magnetic reconnection or magnetic dissipation instabilities when each buoyant magnetic field torus floats up to break through the stellar surface ( kluniak & ruderman , 1998 ; dai et al .",
    "this released energy can be satisfied with prompt emission requirement of grbs observations .",
    "after that , magnetar continuously spin down , residual rotational energy would be dissipated by magnetic dipole radiation to power the x - ray internal plateau .",
    "also , similar physical process was proposed to produce relativistic jet and later x - ray plateau with a varying @xmath13 value in different phase ( metzger et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "one interesting question is that how to distinguish the origin of its prompt emission , which is important for understanding the composition of the jet . within those two different physical process , from the theoretical point of view , if the grb hot jet powered by neutrino annihilation , it predicts a lower radiative efficiency , typically a few percent ( kumar 1999 ; panaitescu et al . 1999 ; kumar & zhang 2015 ) . in contrary ,",
    "if the magnetic dissipation is dominated in the prompt emission , it is along with high efficiency , as high as @xmath14 depending on the @xmath13 value ( zhang & yan 2011 ) . to distinguish these two models",
    ", we suggest to compare the radiation efficiency between the prompt emission phase and internal plateau phase .",
    "it is wildly accepted that the internal plateau phase is from magnetar wind dissipation process , so that if the radiation efficiency of the prompt phase is similar to the plateau phase , magnetic dissipation of magnetar is favored , otherwise neutron star surrounded by a hyper - accreting would be favored .",
    "this paper is to address this interesting question through analyze the data of grb 070110 .",
    "the xrt data reduction and fitting are presented in  2 . in  3 , we show detail calculations of radiation efficiency . finally ,",
    "the conclusions and discussion are given in  4 . throughout , a concordance cosmology with parameters @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are adopted .",
    "so far , more than 120 grbs have been observed with shallow ( or plateau ) decay segment in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "however , if a normal decay is followed the plateau , it can not be confident to show that the shallow decay is originated from the internal dissipation of magnetar spin - down ( panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to find out the magnetar signature , which typically invokes a shallow decay phase ( or plateau ) followed by a steeper decay segment ( steeper than @xmath19 ) .",
    "one requires three independent criteria to define our sample .",
    "first , it displays an @xmath0internal plateau@xmath1 .",
    "second , after the sharp decay following with plateau , another power - law component is appeared with decay index less than 1.5 , which is contributed by the external shock emission .",
    "third , the redshift of the burst need to be measured , in order to estimate the gamma - ray energy and kinetic energy .",
    "we systematically process the xrt data of more than 1250 grbs observed between 2005 january and 2016 march . only grb 070110 , with duration",
    "@xmath20s , is satisfied with those three requirements in our entire sample .",
    "we next perform a temporal fit to the plateau behavior of grb 070110 with a smooth broken power law @xmath21^{-1/\\omega},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] add single power - law function @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the break time , @xmath24 is the flux at the break time @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are decay indices , respectively , and @xmath29 describes the sharpness of the break",
    ". the larger the @xmath29 parameter , the sharper the break .",
    "we also collect the optical observational data from troja et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "both x - ray and optical light curve are shown in figure 1 , and fitting result is presented in table 1 .",
    "another two important parameters are the isotropic gamma - ray energy ( @xmath30 ) and kinetic energy ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "@xmath30 was measured from the observation flunce and distance , read as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the redshift , @xmath34 is the luminosity distance , @xmath35 is gamma - ray fluence in bat band , and @xmath36 is the @xmath36-correction factor from the observed band to @xmath37 kev in the burst rest frame ( e.g. bloom et al .",
    "more details , please refer to l & zhang ( 2014 ) .",
    "the @xmath38 , is isotropic kinetic energy of the fireball .",
    "it could be estimated by standard forward afterglow model ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; fan & piran 2006 ) . for the late time",
    "x - ray afterglow data ( @xmath39s ) , one has decay slope @xmath40 , and the spectral index @xmath41 in the normal decay segment . approximately , they are satisfied @xmath42 in the spectral regime @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the typical and cooling frequencies of synchrotron radiation , respectively . following the equations and methods of yost et al ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the flux was recorded in xrt ( 0.3 kev - 10 kev ) as , @xmath46 in this calculation , the compton parameter ( y ) is assigned to a typical value @xmath47 .",
    "combine with the observational data , one obtain @xmath48 , the physical parameters of forward shock model are shown in table 1 , and the fitting result is presented in figure 1 .",
    "since the internal plateau of grb 070110 was explained by invoking magnetic dipole radiation of spin - down magnetar central engine . in this section ,",
    "we use data to derive relevant physical magnetar parameters of grb 070110 ( e.g. the initial spin period @xmath49 and the surface polar cap magnetic field @xmath50 ) .",
    "the energy reservoir is the total rotation energy of the millisecond magnetar , which reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the moment of inertia , @xmath53 is the initial angular frequency of the neutron star , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is radius of ns , and the convention @xmath56 is adopted in cgs units for all other parameters throughout the paper . assuming that the magnetar with initial spin period @xmath49 is being spun down by a magnetic dipole with surface polar cap magnetic field @xmath50 , the characteristic spin - down luminosity and spin - down time scale are @xmath57 @xmath58 the internal plateau energy of grb 070110 from internal dissipation ( @xmath59 ) is calculated based on the lightcurve fitting result and redshift information ,",
    "read as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath25 is the starting and end time of internal plateau . here , we adopt @xmath62 .",
    "actually , the starting time is not effect the result too much because @xmath61 is much less than @xmath25 .    on the other hand , two additional constraints are required to be satisfied in this situation .",
    "firstly , the spin - down luminosity of magnetar should be brighter than observational internal plateau luminosity of grb 070110 if internal plateau emission is contributed from magnetic dipole radiation , namely @xmath63 .",
    "another one is that spin - down time scale is larger than duration of internal plateau ( maybe collapse time of magnetar into black hole ) , @xmath64 .",
    "use those two constraints with lower limit of initial period ns survived , the region of initial period and surface polar cap magnetic field of ns are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the result is shown in figure 2 ( gray region ) .",
    "one interesting question is that what is the radiative efficiency of grb 070110 for prompt emission and internal plateau within the grb jet produced by neutrino annihilation scenario .",
    "the grb radiation efficiency of prompt emission is defined as ( lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "one has @xmath70 .",
    "another radiative efficiency is from internal dissipation of internal plateau , which is defined as the ratio between internal plateau energy and total magnetic dipole radiation energy of magnetar ( @xmath71 ) , read as @xmath72 it reflects how efficient the internal dissipation converts the total magnetic dipole energy into radiation during the x - ray internal plateau phase .",
    "the total magnetic dipole radiation energy @xmath71 should be less than @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 , one can get the lower limit of efficiency of internal plateau @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the clear difference between the radiation efficiencies of prompt emission and internal plateau implies that they may be originated from different components , e.g. prompt emission from the relativistic jet powered by neutrino annihilation , while the internal plateau from the magnetic outflow wind .",
    "an internal dissipation process of magnetar with poynting - flux dominated outflow was invoked to interpret internal plateau phase of grb afterglows .",
    "we suggest that comparing the radiation efficiency of prompt emission and internal plateau phase could help to investigate the composition of grb jet .",
    "we focus on analyzing the data of grb 070110 which exhibits internal plateau feature following a normal decay .",
    "we firstly estimate the physical parameters of magnetar based on the observational feature of internal plateau , the parameter regime of initial period ( @xmath78 ) and surface polar cap magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) of ns are @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . in this case",
    ", the radiation efficiency of prompt emission would be @xmath70 if the grb jet was powered by neutrino annihilation .",
    "on the other hand , the lower limit of internal plateau radiative efficiency is estimated as @xmath81 with @xmath9 and @xmath82 .    since the standard internal shock model and magnetic dissipation model for prompt emission predict lower and higher radiation efficiency , respectively ( kumar 1999 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "1999 ; usov 1992 ; zhang & yan 2011 ) .",
    "also , it is wildly accepted that the internal plateau phase is from magnetar wind dissipation process , and the prompt emission radiation efficiency ( @xmath83 ) is much less than the minimum efficiency of internal plateau ( @xmath81 ) , so that the prompt emission and later internal plateau of grb 070110 may be from different origin , e.g. , a new - born neutron star surrounded by a hyper - accreting disk generates the prompt emission , while the magnetic dipole dissipation is account for the later internal plateau .",
    "one suspicion is that whether the neutrino annihilation of ns cooling can power the prompt emission of grb 070110 . if neutron star surrounded by a hyper - accreting model was accepted to power the grb jet , the neutrino annihilation luminosity ( @xmath84 ) is contributed by neutrinos emitted from both disk and neutron star surface layer .",
    "following zhang & dai ( 2009 ) method , there is no analytical solution of @xmath84 , but related to several parameters , e.g. accretion rate ( @xmath85 ) , outflow index ( @xmath86 ) , viscosity ( @xmath87 ) , energy parameter ( @xmath88 ) and efficiency factor to measure the surface emission ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "therefore , we have to use numerical method to get the solution with right parameters to compare with observational prompt emission luminosity .",
    "since @xmath84 are not sensitively depending on the @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath86 ( see figure 7 and 8 in zhang & dai 2009 ) , we fix the typical value of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . assuming @xmath93 and @xmath94 , one has @xmath95 .",
    "however , it is isotropic energy instead of true energy . due to lack observation of jet break feature",
    ", one can estimate lower limit of the jet opening angle with the last observed point ( @xmath96 days ) in x - ray afterglow , read as @xmath97 the prompt emission energy of grb jet after beaming - corrected is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is beaming factor of the grb 070110 @xmath100 and the luminosity of prompt emission is @xmath101 .",
    "one has @xmath102 with typical value of parameters and @xmath94 , namely , neutrino annihilation of ns can provide enough energy to power the grb jet .",
