    "although little is known about the fate of a planetary system when a main - sequence star eventually becomes a white dwarf , we can now detect with modern instrumentation indirect signatures of disrupted comets and asteroids in the atmospheres and circumstellar environments of cool white dwarfs . here , we report infrared observations of gd 362 that strengthen the argument that this star is orbited by debris from a tidally disrupted asteroidal - size body .    gravitational settling of elements heavier than the dominant light gas  either hydrogen or helium  through the relatively thin outer convective zones of white dwarfs occurs rapidly ( paquette et al .",
    "therefore , the atmospheres of the stars which are cool enough that radiative levitation is unimportant are anticipated to be metal - free . in agreement with this expectation , @xmath175% of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs with effective temperatures",
    "less than 10,000 k have calcium abundances below 10@xmath2 solar ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , some cool white dwarfs do display atmospheric metals , and these stars are almost certainly externally - polluted .",
    "one of the most remarkable metal - bearing cool white dwarfs is gd 362 which has approximately solar abundances of calcium , magnesium and iron ( gianninas et al .",

    "( 2005 ) independently reported ground - based observations showing that gd 362 has an infrared excess produced by circumstellar dust which is likely to be the source of the external - pollution required to explain the star s photospheric composition .",
    "after g29 - 38 ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ) , gd 362 is the second single white dwarf discovered to display an infrared excess .",
    "here we report _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( werner et al . 2004 ) observations of gd 362 to study better its infrared emission and to constrain models for the origin of the circumstellar dust .    a promising model to explain both the infrared excesses and the relatively high metal abundances within both gd 362 and g29 - 38 is that these stars accrete from an opaque dust disk , reminiscent of saturn s rings , produced by the tidal - disruption of an asteroid ( jura 2003 , becklin et al .",
    "a somewhat different approach was taken by reach et al .",
    "( 2005b ) who proposed that the infrared data for g29 - 38 can be explained by an optically thin cloud .",
    "these two different models for the infrared excesses around white dwarfs can imply dramatically different amounts of mass in the circumstellar environment .",
    "if there is an opaque disk , there may be in excess of @xmath110@xmath3 g of circumstellar dust , comparable to the mass of ceres , the largest asteroid in the solar system .",

    "the extractions were performed twice : first with the default aperture function ( 8 pixels at 12 @xmath0 m ) in order to assess the proper calibration level , which does not exist for custom ( non - default ) aperture extractions ; and second with a smaller aperture function ( 4 pixels at 12 @xmath0 m ) which yielded a higher snr extraction .",
    "the custom extraction was scaled appropriately to match the overall level of the default extraction and all the orders were combined ( and averaged in regions of overlap , including the short - low 1 bonus section which has a spectral range of 7.3 @xmath0 m to 8.7 @xmath0 m ) . in our data",
    "we clearly detect only silicate emission ; higher signal to noise is required to determine if other features are present .",
    "the spectrum and the associated errors are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the _ spitzer _ data show a strong silicate feature near 10 @xmath0 m , consistent with the ground - based photometry presented by becklin et al .",
    "the profile of the silicate emission from gd 362 resembles the emission feature seen by reach et al .",
    "( 2005b ) for g29 - 38 , and it is distinctly different from the profile of interstellar silicates ( kemper et al .",

    "bd + 20 307 notably exhibits a strong silicate feature from grains at a temperature near 650 k ( song et al . 2005 ) , and we see from figure 1 that the spectra of gd 362 and bd + 20 307 agree fairly well except that the blue wing of the feature is stronger in gd 362 , which , as described below , can be understood if the grain temperature is near @xmath11100 k.",
    "becklin et al . ( 2005 ) found that their ground - based continuum data from 1.2 @xmath0 m to 11.3 @xmath0 m for gd 362 could be moderately well matched with a geometrically - thin , flat , opaque disk whose total thickness is much less than the diameter of the star and where the dust temperature is a function only of the radial distance from the star . the flux in the @xmath13 ( 11.3 @xmath0 m ) filter in the michelle instrument on the gemini north telescope was substantially above the prediction of the model disk .",
    "this discrepancy is now understood as a result of the very strong silicate emission ( see figure 1 ) entering into the @xmath13 filter which has a full - width half - maximum of 2.4 @xmath0 m . without any temperature gradient vertical to the disk ,",
    "this model can not , by itself , explain the strong silicate emission .",
    "therefore , we present a more sophisticated disk model .",
    "we assume a passive disk with three regions so that at every radius , the disk re - radiates the flux incident upon it . a schematic edge - on view of our model is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the inner region has sufficient surface density that it is opaque at all wavelengths of interest .",
    "furthermore , thermal conductivity is sufficiently great in this region that the disk is vertically isothermal .",
    "further out , the disk is still opaque , but thermal conductivity is less important , and there is a temperature gradient in the disk .",
    "the outer region of the disk is thick enough to absorb most of the incident radiation , but it is optically thin in the infrared .",
    "this outermost portion of the disk has relatively little mass , and therefore it can be warped .",
    "our model is somewhat artificial since the three regions are distinct , and therefore it has unrealistic temperature jumps at the boundaries between the regions .",
    "these temperature jumps are most important in the midplane of the disk which emits little light and thus the model predictions are not strongly affected by our overly simplified description of the disk temperature variations .",
    "if @xmath14 denotes the distance from the star and @xmath15 denotes the optical depth from the top of the disk measured downwards , then as with a stellar atmosphere , the emergent intensity , @xmath16 , for a disk seen at inclination angle @xmath17 defined such that a face - on disk has @xmath17 = 0@xmath18 , is @xmath19)\\,\\exp(-{\\tau}_{\\nu}/\\cos\\,i)\\,\\left(d{\\tau}_{\\nu}/\\cos\\,i\\right)\\ ] ] if @xmath20 denotes the distance to gd 362 , the flux received at earth , @xmath21 , is @xmath22 to model the observed flux , we compute the temperature at all locations within the disk .",
    "close to the star , unshielded grains can get very hot and rapidly sublimate",
    ". however , if thermal conductivity between a grain and the surrounding gas is important in regulating a grain s temperature , then the disk can be approximately vertically isothermal .",
    "consequently , even close to the star , grains at the top of the disk can survive .",
    "the importance of thermal conduction depends upon the amount of gas in the disk . in the solar system ,",
    "ceres has a mean density of 2.1 g @xmath23 and an estimated water content between 17% and 27% by mass ( mccord & sotin 2005 , thomas et al .",
    "the tidal destruction of an analog to ceres could thus provide the disk with gaseous hydrogen , and a gas to dust ratio by mass between 0.02 and 0.03 .",
    "additional elements such as sodium and potassium can be gaseous at 1300 k in metal - enhanced environments ( ebel & grossman 2000 ) , but we ignore this contribution to the gas composition .",
    "thermal conduction is important in determining the grain temperature , @xmath12 , when the rates of energy exchange from the grain surface to its surroundings by gas particles and photons are comparable .",
    "this situation occurs when ( burke & hollenbach 1983 ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the stephan - boltzmann constant , @xmath26 is boltzmanns s constant , @xmath27 is the gas number density in the midplane of the disk and @xmath28 is the mean atomic weight of the gas .",
    "if @xmath29 denotes the mass surface density of the gaseous fraction of the disk and with the usual assumption that the disk is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , then at distance @xmath14 from the star of mass @xmath30 : @xmath31 from equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , thermal conduction is important if : @xmath32 adopting very approximate values of @xmath14 @xmath1 10@xmath33 cm , @xmath12 @xmath1 1000 k , @xmath30 @xmath1 0.8 m@xmath34 , and @xmath28 = 3.3 @xmath35",

    "therefore , in regions where the gas density is @xmath4010@xmath41 of the grain density as expected from the disruption of an analog to ceres ( see above ) , thermal conduction is important . for a flat disk where the thermal conduction inhibits any vertical thermal gradient ,",
    "the temperature is ( see , for example , chiang & goldreich 1997 ) : @xmath42      beyond the innermost region , grains at the top of the disk can survive even without efficient thermal conduction , and there may be a vertical temperature gradient . to compute the grain temperature as a function of location ,",
    "we adopt a model similar to that of a planetary atmosphere goody & yung ( 1989 ) or a disk around a pre - main - sequence star ( calvet et al . 1991 ) .",
    "we define @xmath43 as ratio of the planck mean opacities in the optical , @xmath44 and infrared , @xmath45 : @xmath46 in this approach , we assume that the grains are heated by optical light and re - radiate infrared light .",
    "we assume that all of the dust particles at a given distance from gd 362 have the same radius , @xmath47 , and therefore at each location a single temperature characterizes the material .",
    "we also assume that the spectral character of the incident stellar radiation does not vary with optical depth so that @xmath44 is constant throughout the atmosphere .",
    "we further neglect the temperature variations in @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , @xmath43 depends only upon the grain size , and it varies as a function of its distance from the star since we allow for different - size grains at different radial locations .",

    "( 2005b ) fit the observations of g29 - 38 with a combination of amorphous silicate ( to account for the peak of the feature ) and forsterite ( to explain its red wing ) . here , for simplicity , to derive @xmath43 , we include only glassy silicate grains with an olivine stoichiometry described by dorschner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the case with equal abundances of magnesium and iron .",
    "as shown below , we find a satisfactory fit to the silicate feature without any forsterite because we include relatively large grains .",
    "our model for the grains is similar to that used by chen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to account for the silicate emission from the debris disk which emits near 360 k around the main sequence star @xmath71 crv .",
    "we adopt model parameters to match the data ; a summary of the dimensions and temperatures of our model disk is given in table 2 .",
    "following gianninas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we assume that the effective temperature of the star is 9740 k , but this value may be revised upwards perhaps as much as @xmath110% with a better measure of the atmospheric helium abundance .",
    "we assume that the temperature of the grains is less than approximately 1200 k so that they do not rapidly sublimate ; this choice for the maximum grain temperature is consistent with the spectral energy distribution of the infrared excess excess near 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "given this maximum grain temperature , we adopt an inner disk radius of 12 @xmath51 .",
    "the relatively low flux at 24 @xmath0 m means that the disk can not extend too far outwards , for otherwise there would be more cool dust and therefore more emission at this wavelength than measured .",
    "we therefore assume that the opaque disk is truncated at 50 @xmath51 .",
    "to fit the entire infrared continuum , we adopt a transition between region i and region ii at 30 @xmath51 , although the overall fit is insensitive to this choice and region i could extend between 12 @xmath51 and 50 @xmath51 . in order that the grains at the top of the disk in region ii not exceed 1200 k , we adopt @xmath43 = 1.5 which is achieved by our model glassy grains with radii of 2 @xmath0 m .    in our model , the silicate emission is largely produced in region iii , the optically thin outer portion of the disk beyond 50 @xmath51 .",
    "so that the grain temperature lies below about 1200 k , we adopt @xmath43 = 5 which is characteristic of our model glassy grains with a radius of 1 @xmath0 m . to enable the very strong silicate feature to reprocess about 1% of the total luminosity of the star , we assume region iii is warped because a flat disk can not intercept enough light from the illuminating star . the maximum fraction of the star s luminosity that a flat disk of inner radius @xmath14 can re - emit is @xmath72 , and with @xmath14 = 50 @xmath51 , the outer portion of the disk can reprocess at most 1% of the energy of the star .",
    "since the dust might emit only @xmath150% of its light in the silicate feature , the outer portion of a flat disk can not account for the strength of the feature .",
    "there is a degeneracy between the warp angle and the outer radius of region iii of the disk . since the grains that produce",
    "the silicate emission can not also produce much emission at 24 @xmath73 , we infer that these particles are relatively warm .",
    "we therefore , adopt 70 @xmath51 as the outer radius of the warped thin disk .",
    "with this outer radius , the strength of the silicate feature is reproduced with a mean warp angle of 7.5@xmath18 .",
    "we display in figure 3 a comparison between the data and the reasonably - fitting model .",
    "we somewhat overestimate the flux at 24 @xmath0 m , but this measurement is only a 4@xmath74 result and therefore somewhat uncertain . also , the width of the peak in the model spectrum is somewhat narrower than that shown by the data so that other materials besides glassy silicates might be present in the disk .",
    "crystalline material may contribute to the shape of the silicate emission , and a spectrum longward of 15 @xmath0 m can test this possibility ( jaeger et al .",
    "regardless of these uncertainties , it seems that the dust lies fully within the star s tidal radius of @xmath11 @xmath75 , consistent with the hypothesis that the dust disk around gd 362 was created by tidal disruption of an asteroidal - size parent body .",
    "our results constrain possible models for the origin of the dust near gd 362 . for optically thin emission ,",
    "the mass of circumstellar dust , @xmath76 , is : @xmath77 where f@xmath78 is the flux . consider the silicate feature .",

    "2004 ) , then the star may have already accreted more than 10@xmath3 g. consequently , it is plausible that there is much more circumstellar mass than inferred from the silicate emission feature . supported by our modeling of the infrared spectral energy distribution , we suggest that the bulk of the circumstellar mass resides in an opaque , flat disk .",
    "garcia - berro et al . ( 2006 ) proposed that gd 362 is the result of the merger of two lower mass white dwarfs and that the circumstellar disk is a remnant of this event ( see also livio et al . 2005 ) .",

    ", even young massive white dwarfs do not characteristically display infrared excesses from dust ( hansen et al .",

    "an indirect measurement that constrains the dust geometry in g29 - 38 , a white dwarf that bears many similarities to gd 362 , is given by the periodic intensity variations in the infrared disk emission which are driven by the non - radial optical - light variations of this zz ceti class star ( graham et al .",

    "2006 , in preparation      following pringle ( 1991 ) , we present a simple description of a dust disk to assess whether it can be warped . we assume that the disk is formed from an asteroidal - size body that is initially disrupted at its periastron , @xmath86 and relatively quickly forms a thin ring which then expands under the action of its own viscosity to form an orbiting disk with mass @xmath87 .",
    "after the initial conditions damp out , the surface density , @xmath88 , is conveniently expressed ( jura et al .",
    "2002 ) as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the radial flow speed due to viscosity and @xmath91 is the age of the disk .",
    "we define @xmath92 as : @xmath93 so that @xmath92 measures the ratio of the spreading distance of the disk compared to its initial location .",
    "because the value of @xmath90 is not well measured , we use @xmath92 to characterize a mature disk . if @xmath92 @xmath60 1 , then the disk has not had much time to evolve from its initial configuration while if @xmath92 @xmath40 1 , the disk may have largely dissipated .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath94 @xmath1 1 for the systems of interest .",
    "while a warp might be driven by hydromagnetic ( quillen 2001 ) or magnetic ( lai 1999 ) torques , we consider radiative - driven warping . according to pringle ( 1996 ) ,",
    "if the disk is opaque in the infrared , it is unstable to self - induced warping if the star s luminosity , @xmath95 , is large enough so the backreaction of radiation leaving the surface of the disk can induce a sufficiently strong torque , which occurs if : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the azimuthal viscosity . making the uncertain extrapolation that the azimuthal and radial viscosities are equal , we write @xmath97 = @xmath98 , and then using equation ( a1 ) , warping occurs where : @xmath99 for gd 362 the relevant parameters are very uncertain .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we adopt @xmath95 = 2 @xmath100 10@xmath101 l@xmath34 , @xmath30 = 0.8 m@xmath34 , and @xmath87 = 10@xmath3 g. given that the accretion rate might be @xmath110@xmath102 g s@xmath81 ( becklin et al .",
    "2005 ) , we estimate @xmath91 = 10@xmath103 yr , @xmath92 = 1 and @xmath86 = 3 @xmath35 10@xmath33 cm . in this case , the disk is warped for @xmath14 larger than @xmath150 r@xmath104 .",
    "the disk is unstable to radiative warping only where it is optically thick .",
    "we assume that such warping occurs , and then the disk then expands further and becomes optically thin . in this very outermost region ,",
    "the decay time for the warp can be as long as the disk expansion time ( armitage & pringle 1997 ) , and therefore the optically thin portion of the disk effectively retains the warp it acquired when it was more compact ."
