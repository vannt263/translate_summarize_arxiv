    "this has been interpreted as the presence of high clouds or haze with a cloud - top at around 0.1 - 0.01 mbar , depending on the atmospheric metallicity @xcite .",
    "a titan - like organic haze may be photochemically produced , but the actual mechanism is not yet known for such a warm atmosphere .",
    "condensate clouds of potassium chloride or zinc sulfide ( kcl and zns ) may also form @xcite , but would form deeper in the atmosphere , at 0.1 - 1 bar ( see fig . [",
    ". a featureless transit spectrum due to condensate clouds would therefore require a strong atmospheric circulation , lofting particles to lower pressures .",
    "here we use the observed spectra of gj1214b as a test case to constrain mechanisms for the possible formation of high condensate clouds on gj1214b and similar exoplanets .",

    "the composition is assumed to be at thermochemical equilibrium in each gcm cell .",
    "we used the same orbital , physical and stellar parameters as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we assumed that gj1214b is synchronously rotating .",
    "we ran simulations with a 64@xmath348 horizontal resolution and with 50 layers equally spaced in log pressure , spanning 80 bars to 6@xmath310@xmath4 bar .",

    "we considered only kcl and zns clouds , although na@xmath2s and other iron or silicate clouds could form in the deeper atmosphere and be removed @xcite .",
    "we fixed the radius of cloud particles everywhere in the atmosphere , and treated the cloud particle radius as a free parameter .",
    "we ran simulations with cloud particle radii from 0.1 to 10 @xmath0 m , with the same radii for kcl and zns clouds .",

    "the formation of kcl and zns cloud occurs through the thermochemical reactions @xcite :",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7    we used the saturation vapor pressures of kcl and zns from @xcite and @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we considered only the transport of atomic zn ( the limiting element in equation 2 ) as an idealized zns vapor .",
    "we then considered both reactions as simple gas - solid phase changes with no supersaturation and with a latent heat of 2923 kj / kg for kcl and 3118 kj / kg for zns .",
    "we fixed the abundance of kcl vapor to 2.55@xmath310@xmath8 mol / mol ( 4.3@xmath310@xmath9kg / kg ) and the abundance of zns vapor to 8.5@xmath310@xmath4 mol / mol ( 1.8@xmath310@xmath9kg / kg ) in the deep atmosphere , corresponding to values from @xcite for a 100@xmath3solar metallicity .",

    "[ figure_1]a ) .",
    "the altitude above which clouds form drops from around 40 mbar at the equator to around 200 mbar at the poles because of latitudinal temperature gradients ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] ) . above this condensation altitude , temperatures are never high enough to significantly evaporate clouds .",
    "cloud particles are therefore stable and act as simple tracers . because the sedimentation timescale is generally much longer than the advection timescale , their distribution is mostly driven by the zonal mean circulation . for a synchronously - rotating planet ,",
    "the circulation is shaped by the strong day - night temperature contrast and standing planetary waves @xcite .",
    "this pattern is globally associated with upwelling on the dayside and equatorial downwelling on the nightside @xcite .",
    "the latter is mostly produced by two very strong equatorial downdrafts close to the terminators and dominates below 1 mbar for 100@xmath3solar metallicity .",
    "therefore , the zonal mean circulation globally exhibits an anti - hadley circulation below 1 mbar and a hadley circulation above @xcite .",
    "this anti - hadley circulation occurs in the region where clouds form , and strongly impacts their global distribution , leading to a cloud minimum at the equator and a maximum between 40 - 60@xmath11 latitude in both hemispheres for pressures lower than 0.1 mbar ( see top left panel in fig [ figure_2 ] ) .",

    "the 3d modeling of radiatively active clouds in gj1214b s atmosphere is challenging .",
    "because of cloud opacity , the atmospheric radiative timescale becomes shorter in the upper atmosphere and the condensation occurs deeper in the atmosphere , where the sedimentation timescale is longer . with the current computational resources , it is impossible to obtain a fully converged 3d simulation at pressure significantly greater than around 1 bar .",
    "however , all results ( e.g. cloud vertical mixing , thermal structure and observational spectra ) for the upper atmosphere can be valid .",
    "we ran simulations with radiatively active clouds for 300 days , accelerating thermal convergence ( see section [ model ] ) .",
    "these simulations were thermally converged up to around 1 bar and the cloud distribution is locally at equilibrium up to 10 mbar ( see @xcite ) . since the simulations were not converged in the deep atmosphere , they may overestimate cloud abundance in the upper atmosphere .    with radiatively active clouds , the planetary albedo increases from almost 0 to 0.4 for 3 @xmath0 m particles , and up to 0.6 for 0.1 @xmath0 m particles .",
    "stellar radiation penetrates less deeply in the atmosphere , cooling pressures higher than @xmath121 mbar ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_1]a ) .",
    "consequently , clouds form deeper , at around 0.6 bar for 0.5 @xmath0 m particles . at this pressure",
    ", there is almost no latitudinal temperature variation and so clouds form at the same altitude globally ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] ) . above 10 mbar ,",
    "the cloud vertical mixing is similar with and without cloud radiative effects ( see fig . [",
    "figure_1]b ) . with radiatively active clouds",
    ", the anti - hadley circulation appears reinforced with a clear minimum of cloud at the equator ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] ) .    above 10 mbar ,",
    "the absorption of stellar radiation by zns clouds forms a stratospheric thermal inversion on the dayside . at the substellar point ,",
    "the difference between the maximal and the minimal stratospheric temperature reaches around 350 k , 225 k and 50 k for particle radii of 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "in contrast , the temperature at the anti - stellar point is not affected by the presence of clouds , which are optically thin to the thermal emission . for 0.1 @xmath0 m particles ,",
    "the heating by zns is strong enough to evaporate kcl clouds in the dayside above 1 mbar ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_1]a and fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] ) .",
    "the evaporation of zns clouds stops this heating , producing a strong negative feedback which stabilizes the temperature below the zns evaporation curve ( see fig .",

    "is limited to pressures lower than 0.1 mbar .",

    "we computed spectra using hitran 2012 and using gcm temperature and cloud profiles , averaged at the limbs . because the cloud inhomogeneities are weak at limbs , these averaged profiles are an excellent approximation to more accurate spectra obtained by combining apparent planetary radii from each latitudinal point at the limb ( see fig [ figure_3]a ) .    fig [ figure_3]a shows transit spectra with a cloud particle radius of 0.5 @xmath0 m for the 100@xmath3solar metallicity case .",
    "differences between transit spectra from gcm simulations with radiatively and non - radiatively active clouds are negligible .",
    "the reference case ( non - radiatively active cloud ) always matches the data at less than 2@xmath13 ( reduced @xmath14=1.3 compared to 1.0 for a perfectly flat spectrum ) . in these simulations , the cloud - top pressure ( @xmath15 )",
    "is around 0.02 mbar , 10 - 100 times higher than retrieved by @xcite for the same metallicity . yet",
    ", there are several differences between these studies .",
    "unlike our study , they use a gray cloud opacity , and their temperature and gravity are different ( 580 k and 8.48 m / s@xmath16 versus our @xmath12460 k at limbs and 8.9 m / s@xmath16 ) .",
    "they also only consider water as a heavy element , so their mean molecular mass is smaller than ours ( 3.6 versus our 4.38 g / mol ) .",
    "these changes make their atmosphere scale height 60@xmath5 higher than ours , requiring higher clouds to get a flat spectrum .",
    "[ figure_3]b shows transit spectra for the 100@xmath3solar metallicity case without cloud , and with cloud particle radii of 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 @xmath0 m .",

    "appear at wavelengths longer than around 3 @xmath0 m ( e.g. peak of co@xmath2 at 4.3 @xmath0 m ) where the clouds are optically thin .",
    "in addition , a slope can be clearly identified between 3 and 10 @xmath0 m for 0.5 @xmath0 m particles , whereas it remains very weak for 1 @xmath0 m particles . according to our model",
    ", the cloud particle radius of 0.5 @xmath0 m is the optimal size , allowing both strong mixing and a flatter transit spectrum with a reduced slope .    in fig .",
    "[ figure_3]c , we tested deviations of cloud abundances compared to the reference case , assuming that it is proportional to kcl and zns vapor abundances in the deep atmosphere ( as suggested by the limited impact of latent heat and cloud radiative effects on the vertical mixing ) .",
    "an enhancement by a factor 3 slightly flattens the spectrum .",
    "however , cloud abundances could be strongly limited by condensation occurring below 10 bars ( see fig [ figure_1]a ) .    finally , fig .",

    "a secondary peak is present at 4.5 @xmath0 m and a third one at 8.2 - 10 @xmath0 m corresponding to other spectral windows .",
    "the thermal emission strongly varies between the dayside and nightside in the water and methane absorption bands between 5.2 and 8.2 @xmath0 m . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the photosphere is located at around 0.5 mbar , where the temperature variations are strong ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_1]a ) .",
    "0.5 @xmath0 m cloud particles strongly impact the emission spectra .",
    "the thermal emission is generally reduced with clouds , except in the atmospheric absorption bands ( e.g. 5.2 - 8.2 @xmath0 m ) where it is slightly enhanced .",
    "clouds cool the atmosphere below 1 mbar and so the brightness temperature never exceeds 600k .",
    "the emission peaks at 4 , 4.5 and 10 @xmath0 m are reversed on the dayside because of the stratospheric thermal inversion .",
    "globally , the presence of clouds has a limited impact on the amplitude of the phase curves ( see fig [ figure_4]b ) , which primarily depends on the atmospheric metallicity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of thermal emission variations , in particular in the 6.3 @xmath0 m water band ( between 5.2 and 7.3 @xmath0 m ) , is an excellent probe of the atmospheric metallicity of gj1214b .",
