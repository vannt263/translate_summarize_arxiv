    "recent experimental and theoretical works have shown that introducing lattice matched nanocrystals into an alloy can further reduce its thermal conductivity , in what has been termed `` beating the alloy limit''@xcite .",
    "this has a very important practical application in the field of thermoelectric materials , in which a major goal is to obtain low thermal conductivities without affecting electronic properties .",
    "the fact that clusters of scatterers can scatter phonons more efficiently than they would if they acted separately has been known for some time  @xcite . however , combining atomic and cluster scattering effects in order to minimize the thermal conductivity had not been clearly achieved until recently , and only for three dimensional systems  @xcite .    in confined systems , such as nanowires or nanotubes , there appear to be no experimental reports on this approach .",
    "the case of isotopic scattering in carbon nanotubes is especially interesting in this respect .",
    "first , it represents a well defined system , where theory  @xcite has been successful in explaining measurements  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the use of isotopic disorder means that electron transport will not be affected at all .",
    "this means that the thermal conductivity could be tailored independently of the electrical properties of the system , which is especially attractive to nanoelectronics .",
    "in contrast , we do not think carbon nanotubes may be used for thermoelectric applications , due to their still too large thermal conductivity .",
    "one problem is how to create nanostructures with isotopes .",
    "isotopes of different masses are chemically identical , so thermodynamically speaking it is in principle not possible to arrange them inside the solid into anything other than an uncorrelated alloy . nevertheless , there are ways to achieve nanotubes where the isotopic concentration is distributed in a segmented way",
    ". one of them consists in synthesizing nanotubes from c@xmath0 peapods  @xcite .",
    "in particular , c@xmath0 buckyballs can be synthesized with different isotopic concentrations .",
    "for example , pure @xmath1c buckyballs , pure @xmath2c buckyballs , and @xmath2c@xmath3@xmath1c@xmath3 buckyballs could be produced separately .",
    "these different buckyball types can then be mixed together and get to form nanopeapods , with the buckyballs encapsulated into nanotubes . once there , they can be heated up until they coalesce to form an inner nanotube . in absence of carbon diffusion ,",
    "the isotope concentration of the inner tube keeps a segmented distribution in accordance with the distribution of the original buckyball types .",
    "a detailed comparison between the measured and simulated raman spectra of heated nanopeapods has clearly demonstrated that it is indeed possible to obtain segmented isotope distributions  @xcite .",
    "the outer nanotube that has been used to hold the buckyballs can subsequently be removed by , e.g. , burning the outer tube with an electrical current  @xcite . a possible alternative route that may enable the growth of isotopically segmented carbon nanotubes is via chemical vapor deposition techniques @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study thermal transport in isotope engineered carbon nanotubes .",
    "we show that the thermal conductivity can be significantly reduced below the random isotope alloy limit in nanotubes produced from buckyball nanopeapods in which the isotopic disorder is nanostructured .",
    "we consider ( 5,5 ) armchair nanotubes , that have a diameter of 0.68 nm , close to that observed experimentally for the inner tubes produced by the coalescence of buckyball peapods  @xcite .",

    "we assume that the probability to have an isotopically - pure or a mixed section is the same .",
    "finally , for sliced disorder , we also addressed the effect of section size ( 20 , 60 , 120 and 240 atoms ) on the mean free paths .",

    "in general , random disorder scatters short wavelengths ( high frequencies ) quite efficiently , but it does not affect long wavelengths ( low frequencies ) as strongly . on the other hand , larger inhomogeneities comparable in size to the wavelength are much more effective in scattering the low frequency phonons . this can be seen in the plot of the mean free paths in fig .",

    "sliced disorder yields shorter mean free paths than the other disorder types . on the other hand , at high frequency it has longer",
    "mean free paths than the other two types .",
    "in the sliced case , the figure also shows two clearly differentiated dependences with cluster size : at the lower frequencies , the larger the slice , the shorter the mean free path ; for higher frequencies on the other hand , the shorter the slices , the shorter the mean free path .",
    "the latter behavior is a result of the larger density of interfaces when the slices are small .",
    "the low frequency phonons carry most of the heat , due to their much longer mean free paths .",
    "therefore , by employing sliced disorder , it is possible to decrease the thermal conductance of the nanotube below the random disorder value .",
    "figure  [ fig : harmonic_mfp ] also shows an enhanced mean free path at a frequency window around 1100 @xmath14 for the segmented case .",
    "this is the result of angular momentum conservation which forbids many scattering processes .",
    "we verified that such resonance decreases dramatically if the symmetry of the segments is broken by making their edges irregular .",
    "this feature turns out to give a negligible contribution to the thermal conductance .",
    "we have checked that its presence or absence makes no difference in the final thermal conductance , which is determined by the much longer mean free paths of the lowest frequencies .    in order to estimate the temperatures at which the disorder pattern has an influence , we combine , by mathiessen s rule , the mean free paths computed above , and a rough estimate of anharmonic relaxation length in graphite materials  @xcite : @xmath15 , with @xmath16  k@xmath17 @xmath18 m .",

    "[ fig : anharmonic ] compares the conductance computed with mixed or sliced disorder , to the conductance obtained with random mass disorder , as a function of temperature , for different lengths of the tube , with and without the contribution of anharmonic scattering .",
    "the segments in the sliced case considered are 60 atoms in size .",
    "nanostructured disorder can reduce the thermal conductivity of the nanotubes as much as 50% below the isotope alloy limit for low enough temperatures .",
    "therefore , it is possible to obtain thermal conductivities clearly lower than those of the random disorder nanotube .",
    "the observed reductions depend on the temperature and also on the nanotube length . at temperatures",
    "high enough to have important anharmonic scattering , isotope scattering becomes of secondary importance , and nanostructured disorder has a smaller influence .",
    "similarly , if the nanotubes are very short , transport becomes ballistic , and the effect of isotopes on the thermal conductance becomes less apparent .",
    "lowering the temperature increases the impact of nanostructuring , down to a certain minimum at a particular temperature .",
    "below this temperature , the reduction decreases because heat is increasingly carried by low frequency modes , which have very long mean free paths .",

    "thermal conductivity reductions of 50% have been reported for bn nanotubes in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the phonon structures of bn and c nanotubes are rather similar , and the isotope effect at the same concentrations affects them in a similar way @xcite .",
    "thus , carbon nanotubes with sliced disorder at 50% isotope concentration can display even larger reductions than those reported for bn .",
    "the additional effect of segmentation reported here implies that it might be possible to reduce the low temperature ( 50k ) thermal conductivity of long ( 10 @xmath24 m ) pristine carbon nanotubes to less than 30% of the isotopically pure value .",
    "such strong effects are also suggested by the theoretical mean free paths in fig .",
