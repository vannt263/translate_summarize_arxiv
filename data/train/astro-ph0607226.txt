    "a small class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emit broad , double - peaked , low - ionization lines , which most likely originate directly from the agn accretion disk .",
    "the frequency of double - peaked lines is high ( 20% ) among the radio - loud equivalents of seyfert galaxies , broad - line radio galaxies ( blrg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and much lower ( 3% ) among the general population of low - redshift , optically selected agn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s03 ) .",
    "the class of double - peaked emitters is diverse  it includes both radio - loud ( rl ) and radio - quiet ( rq ) agn with luminosities ranging from low - luminosity low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxies to low - luminosity quasars .",
    "the optical spectra of double - peaked emitters are sometimes dominated by the featureless continuum of the agn , but in a significant fraction of cases starlight from the host galaxy makes a dominant contribution to the observed optical continuum .",
    "the handful of double - peaked emission - line blrg with reliable black - hole mass measurements ( 10 black hole masses measured via the triplet velocity dispersion and the relation between stellar velocity dispersion and black - hole mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have @xmath0 and range from low - to - moderate eddington - ratio agn ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the originally studied double - peaked emitters were associated with low optical luminosity agn . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sample , which increased the number of medium - luminosity agn ( see figure  [ luvz ] ) , also showed that the optical luminosity distributions of double - peaked emitters and normal agn at @xmath2 are not substantially different .",
    "this suggests that the apparent lack of double - peaked emitters among the most optically luminous agn is a selection effect related to the rarity of very luminous sources and the small volume of space considered to date .",
    "the large range of eddington ratios observed in agn with double - peaked emission lines together with their large range of luminosities ( which probably translates into a large range of eddington ratios ) suggest that the existence of strong balmer - line emission from the accretion disks of agn is either independent of the eddington ratio of the source , or that there are different explanations for the presence of double - peaked balmer lines in agn with different eddington ratios .",
    "in addition to a large range of eddington ratios , the known double - peaked emitters tend to have broader balmer lines ( @xmath3 the full width at half maximum of normal agn ) and stronger low - ionization narrow lines ( e.g. , [ ]  6300 ) than similar agn without double - peaked lines . as a class ,",
    "the double - peaked emitters possess a diverse set of optical / uv properties but most do not appear remarkably different in their other properties from the general agn population .",
    "based on the prototype double - peaked emitter , arp102b , and the initial sample of double - peaked blrg and liner galaxies , there were reasons to believe that disk emission in agn is associated with low - luminosity , low eddington - ratio accretion in which the inner parts of the accretion disk ( less than a few tens of gravitational radii , @xmath4 ) became geometrically thick and optically thin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , emitting energetic x - rays which illuminate the outer ( outside a few hundred gravitational radii ) regions of the disk @xcite .",
    "since most of the initially known double - peaked emitters had strong balmer lines , which could not have been produced by the release of gravitational energy locally without invoking an unrealistic radiative efficiency , the x - ray illumination from the thick inner disk was necessary to produce strong disk - emission signatures .",
    "the theoretical model presented above remains the best explanation for low - ionization broad - line disk emission in low - luminosity , low eddington - ratio agn . in its original form ,",
    "however , it is not applicable to higher eddington - ratio ( and luminosity ) double - peaked emitters . as the eddington ratio and luminosity of the agn increases , the structure of the inner disk and the illumination pattern of the outer disk change .",
    "in addition , line - driven winds could become important , filling - in the low - velocity minima of the double - peaked emission lines until the profiles are effectively single peaked ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if we can establish clearly the need for external illumination in higher luminosity ( and presumably eddington ratio ) sources , we can revise the theoretical picture of their central regions by exploring evidence for the presence of a different kind of disk - illuminating structure  for example  a `` flared '' disk , a scattering corona , vertically extended wind , or a radiation supported torus .    in search of clues that might reveal the mechanism responsible for the existence of double - peaked balmer lines in agn",
    ", we decided to study in more detail the 0.510kev x - ray properties of this class .",
    "if additional illumination is necessary to produce significant disk line - emission signatures in agn , their high - energy emission and their overall spectral energy distributions might be expected to differ from those of single - peaked agn .",
    "s03 and @xcite calculated the uv - to - x - ray slopes ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) of double - peaked emitters with _",
    "rosat _ all sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) detections and concluded that they do not differ strongly from those of other agn .",
    "these rough comparisons , however , included only x - ray detected subsamples of double - peaked emitters , which are not representative of the full double - peaked sloan digital sky survey sample and the general double - peaked line population .",
    "they also did not take into account the dependence of @xmath5@xmath6 on agn luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present a detailed investigation of the x - ray properties ( soft x - ray luminosities , uv - to - x - ray slopes , x - ray power - law photon indices , and x - ray absorption whenever available ) of a sample of double - peaked emitters serendipitously included in pointed _ rosat _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the sample of double - peaked emitters with x - ray observations is presented in   [ sample ] , followed by the study of their uv - to - x - ray slopes and x - ray spectral shapes in   [ sec3 ] .",
    "  [ ebudget ] discusses the evidence for external illumination , followed by the summary and conclusions in   [ sec4 ] .",
    "in the appendix we comment on the variability of mrk926 , a double - peaked emitter from our sample with several optical and x - ray observations . throughout this work",
    "we use the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ cosmology parameters from @xcite to compute the luminosities of agn : @xmath7 , flat cosmology , with @xmath8=72kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 .",
    "our sample consists of 29 double - peaked emitters selected from the sdss and serendipitously observed or previously targeted by _",
    "rosat _ , _ xmm - newton _ , or _ chandra _ ( hereafter the main sample ) .",
    "we add to this sample 10 blrg , liner galaxies , and rl quasars with good uv and x - ray observations ( hereafter the auxiliary sample ) .",
    "a total of 16 of the 39 double - peaked emitters are rl ( 6 main - sample objects and 10 auxiliary sample objects ) , and the remaining 23 ( main - sample objects ) are rq .      in order to increase the number of sdss double - peaked emitters with sensitive x - ray observations , we start with a sample of sdss agn with @xmath10 ( which guarantees that the h@xmath5 line is observed ) selected from data release 3 ( dr3 , * ? ? ? * ) which fall in pointed _ rosat _ , _ xmm - newton _ , or _",
    "observations that are publicly available .",
    "the effective exposure times ( i.e. , after accounting for the off - axis angle , x - ray background flares , etc . ) of these observations are all @xmath11ks and are @xmath12ks for 80% of the objects ; the median exposure time is 4.2ks . using sdss - rass matches would have substantially increased our sample size but decreased our detection fraction and the total x - ray counts of detected objects ( limiting our ability to extract x - ray spectral information ) . using only the s03 double - peaked emitter sample , which was selected from sdss observations performed prior to march 2003 ,",
    "would have decreased the number of sources , thus weakening the significance of our statistical inferences .    since the double - peaked emitters are a subsample of the asymmetric broad - line agn ( see s03 for more details ) , we start by selecting a subsample of the sdss agn with _ rosat _ , _ xmm - newton _ , or _ chandra _ observations and asymmetric broad h@xmath5 emission lines .",
    "we fit the h@xmath5 line region of each spectrum with a combination of gaussians .",
    "these gaussian representations of the h@xmath5 line region allow us to isolate the broad h@xmath5 line component ( excluding the narrow h@xmath5 , [ ] , and [ ] lines ) and to select the agn with double - peaked broad lines .",
    "in addition , obtaining a smooth representation of the broad h@xmath5 line component allows easy measurement of a set of model - independent parameters : ( 1 ) the rest - frame full width at half maximum , fwhm , ( 2 ) the rest - frame full width at quarter maximum , fwqm , ( 3,4 ) the centroids of the line at half and quarter maximum , fwhmc and fwqmc ( measured with respect to the rest - frame narrow h@xmath5 line ) , ( 5,6 ) the rest wavelengths of the red and blue peaks with respect to the narrow h@xmath5 line , @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath13@xmath15 , and ( 7 ) the peak separation , @xmath16 .",
    "more details on the broad - line parameter measurements and the double - peak selection criteria can be found in  3.2 of s03 ; the h@xmath5 line measurements for the selected objects are reported in table  [ tab7 ] .",
    "eight of the resulting 29 main - sample double - peaked emitters are part of the s03 sample . for consistency with the rest of the sample",
    ", we used the newest sdss spectroscopic reductions currently available and obtained new h@xmath5-line parameter measurements for these eight objects .",
    "the results are consistent with those reported in the s03 paper , within the errors quoted in table  4 of s03 .",
    "the h@xmath5-line luminosities of the eight new reductions were found to be slightly higher on the average ( by 20% ) .",

    "the evidence for this difference is however very weak , relying on the two double - peaked emitters with the flattest values of @xmath85 , both of which are limits .",
    "if these two double - peaked emitters are removed from the comparison , the peto & prentice test gives a 8% probability that the remaining double - peaked emitters are indistinguishable from the normal agn .",
    "the estimates of the spectral shapes in the _ rosat _ band , which are based on hardness ratios , depend sensitively on the assumption that the double - peaked emitters have no intrinsic absorption above the galactic values . as reported in ",
    "[ spgamma ] , we saw no evidence of intrinsic absorption in four of the seven main - sample double - peaked emitters .",
    "the remaining three cases ( sdssj918@xmath175139 , sdssj0938@xmath170057 , and sdssj1111@xmath174820 ) show good evidence of intrinsic absorption , but the @xmath207 estimates are not robust , owing to the small number of counts available and the degeneracy between intrinsic absorption and spectral index in these cases .",
    "the prototype double - peaked emitter arp102b , has a confirmed intrinsic absorbing column , equivalent to @xmath208@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "in fact , significant intrinsic neutral absorbing columns are a general characteristic of nearby blrg ( see figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore plausible that the very hard power - law slope estimates obtained for some double - peaked emitters from the observed hardness ratios are a result of intrinsic absorption that was not taken into account .",
    "for example , sdssj1617 + 3222 ( 3c332 ) , one of the six double - peaked emitters with power - law slope upper limits , has hr1@xmath209 , which , for a galactic obscuration of @xmath210 corresponds to @xmath211 .",
    "the 3c332 _ rosat _ observation was previously studied by @xcite , who conclude that the hard spectral slope obtained by assuming galactic absorption is probably an indication of an intrinsic absorber .",
    "assuming @xmath137 , @xcite derive an obscuring column of @xmath212 .",
    "the uv - to - x - ray spectral - index of 3c332 is @xmath213 , while the value expected for a rl agn with comparable uv monochromatic luminosity is @xmath214 , indicative of weaker x - ray emission than expected and suggestive of intrinsic absorption .",
    "there are a total of four double - peaked emitters in panels a and b of figure  [ gamma1 ] with lower @xmath215 than expected , two rl agn ( 3c332 and sdssj0921 + 4538 ) with @xmath216 , and two rq agn ( sdssj1101 + 5122 and sdssj1150 + 0208 ) with @xmath215 upper limits ( @xmath217 ) . the two rq double - peaked emitters with low @xmath215 upper limits have @xmath60 values consistent within 0.05 with the @xcite relation ( indicating no intrinsic absorption ) , while sdssj0921 + 4538 has @xmath218 , with an expected value of @xmath219 ( indicating @xmath220 stronger x - ray emission than expected and no intrinsic absorption ) . taking into account the fact that three of the four double - peaked emitters with lower than expected @xmath215 upper limits have small numbers of counts and only -band detections , and that the observed scatter in the relation ( @xmath221 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider the above results , with the exception of those for 3c332 , to be inconclusive .",
    "longer observations are necessary to measure accurately the power - law slopes and intrinsic absorption columns for double - peaked emitters with unusually low spectral index estimates in the 0.12kev band .",
    "using the inner ( @xmath222 ) and outer ( @xmath223 ) radii of the h@xmath5 emission region we can estimate the amount of energy available locally in the disk due to viscous stresses and compare it to the luminosity of the h@xmath5 line .",

    "the h@xmath5-line luminosities together with @xmath225 are listed in table  [ tab7 ] .",
    "since only six objects admit axisymmetric - disk profile fits , and only these allow unique estimates of the emitting region , we have no direct measurements of @xmath222 and @xmath223 for each agn in the main sample",

    "figure  [ diskpower ] shows the results assuming a typical double - peaked emitter with @xmath237 and @xmath238 for each of the 23 objects ( i.e. , @xmath240ergs@xmath9 ) .",
    "only two of the 29 ( @xmath241% ) double - peaked emitters would generate enough power locally to produce h@xmath5 lines of the observed strength ( assuming that as much as 20% of the power were radiated in the h@xmath5 line ) . under the above assumptions for the extent of the emission region , the h@xmath5 line luminosity in fact exceeds the power produced locally in the disk in 16 of the 29 cases . even if all double - peaked emitters without axisymmetric - disk fits had @xmath242 ( and @xmath243 ) , @xmath244ergs@xmath9 ;",
    "i.e. , at most 13 out of the 29 ( @xmath245% ) have enough energy generated locally to produce h@xmath5 lines of the observed strength .",
    "we conclude that the majority of double - peaked emitters require external illumination of the disk to account for the strength of the observed h@xmath5 line emission .",

    "the main sample consists of 29 objects selected from the sdss which are representative of the sample of double - peaked emitters studied by s03 .",
    "the remaining 10 objects ( the auxiliary sample ) are the best - studied double - peaked emitters ( eight low optical - luminosity blrg and liner galaxies , and two rl quasars ) with targeted and serendipitous observations .",
    "the total sample includes 16 rl and 23 rq double - peaked emitters .",
    "based on a comparison of the uv - to - x - ray index , @xmath60 , we find that rq double - peaked emitters as a class have comparable emission levels to those of normal rq agn of similar uv luminosity .",
    "rl double - peaked emitters tend to be brighter in the band in comparison with similar - luminosity normal rq agn , as observed for rl agn in general .",
    "the spectral shapes of the double - peaked emitters studied here are consistent with those of normal broad - line agn with similar radio - loudness , with the possible exception of four rl double - peaked emitters with unusually flat soft - band spectra .",
    "three double - peaked emitters observed above 2kev show signs of large intrinsic absorption ( @xmath246 in two of the three cases ) .",
    "the majority of the double - peaked emitters require external illumination of the accretion disk , as the power generated locally is insufficient to produce lines of the observed strength .",
    "this result is more general and was used as an argument against the accretion - disk origin of broad emission lines in agn , irrespective of their profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for agn in which the balmer - lines are double - peaked , this external illumination could be associated with an elevated structure in the inner disk ( e.g. , an emitting corona , jet , or vertically extended torus ) .",
    "however , the fact that the emission of double - peaked emitters as a class does not differ from that of normal agn with similar properties , suggests that a peculiarity of the emission structure and/or mechanism is not responsible for the occurrence of double - peaked balmer lines in agn . despite the importance of illumination for the majority of double - peaked emitters ,",
    "the strength of the emission relative to the optical and uv emission can not be used to predict if the broad , low - ionization lines are double - peaked . by extension ,",
    "the structure of the inner disk is unlikely to be the only ( or the dominant ) reason for the observed double - peaked profiles .",
    "given the fact that double - peaked emitters as a class appear indistinguishable in their x - ray properties from normal agn , the best course for the future might be to study in detail extreme cases of double - peaked emitters .",

    "observations , for example , include one of the most luminous known double - peaked emitters  an agn with a double - peaked line .",
    "in addition , we hope to obtain high - quality hard - band x - ray observations of the broadest double - peaked h@xmath5-line emitters , for which the emission region of the disk is likely to be in the immediate vicinity or even coincident with the x - ray emitting structure .",
