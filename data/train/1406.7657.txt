    "first proposed over 40 years ago , the collisional thick - target model ( cttm ; @xcite ) has come to underpin much of our current knowledge of solar flare physics , from the transport of energy from the corona to the chromosphere by means of a beam of electrons , to impulsive hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission , and the heating of the lower atmosphere .",
    "however , it has recently been called into question , and alternative theories are currently being proposed . for example , @xcite propose that energy is transferred from the corona via alfvn waves , while @xcite suggest that the electrons are accelerated at the location of the hxr footpoints themselves . @xcite",
    "also recently presented evidence of hxr emission emanating from the same ` height ' as the corresponding white light ( wl ) emission during a limb flare , in apparent violation of the cttm prediction .",
    "it is believed that the bulk of a flare s energy ( that deposited by the nonthermal electrons ) is radiated via emission emanating from the lower atmosphere , largely in the form of optical continuum radiation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the extreme ultra - violet ( euv ) component of this radiated emission is believed to be a major energy input into the earth s upper atmosphere and the geospace environment , heating the thermosphere and generating the ionosphere @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , not possible to truly understand the flaring process ( including electron acceleration and energy transport ) and its consequences without understanding the behavior of the chromosphere during these explosive events .",
    "simulations have been made by @xcite using the radyn code of @xcite , which models the chromospheric response to both electron beam heating and backwarming from x - ray and euv photons .",
    "they suggest that chromospheric flare emission is energetically dominated by various recombination ( free - bound ) continua , in particular the lyman , balmer , and paschen continua of hydrogen , plus the he i and he ii continua , as opposed to line ( bound - bound ) emission . however , definitive observations of free - bound emission during solar flares have been scarce in recent years as most modern space - based instruments have not had the sensitivity , wavelength coverage , or duty cycle required to capture unambiguous continuum enhancements during flares . understanding how different continua contribute to the overall energy of flares , including the depth of the atmosphere at which they are emitted and the mechanisms by which they are generated , are crucial for testing solar flare models .",
    "recent observations of solar flares in the total solar irradiance ( tsi ; @xcite ) have placed constraints on the total energy emitted during the largest events ( at a few times 10@xmath3  erg for @xmath4x10 flares ) .",
    "the authors suggested that about 70% of this energy comes from wavelengths longer than 270 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , who used a superposed epoch analysis of flares over a range of magnitudes . these and other studies conclude that the bulk of a flare s energy is radiated by the wl ( `` blue '' ) continuum during the impulsive phase , although they lacked complementary hxr observations to confirm that the energy radiated matched the energy of the nonthermal electrons deemed to be responsible .",
    "however , @xcite concluded that there was sufficient energy in nonthermal electrons above 48  kev to drive the associated optical emission for a wl flare that occurred on 1989 march 7 .",
    "similarly , @xcite used time - dependent beam parameters from hxr observations in an attempt to recreate observations using hydrodynamic modelling ; reasonable agreement was found .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that the electron beam power derived from hxr observations ( assuming thick - target collisions ) could account for the uv , euv , and soft x - ray ( sxr ) components of flare ribbons during an m - class flare , as long as the low energy cutoff was set at 45  kev .",
    "this paper examines how the energy deposited in the lower solar atmosphere by energetic electrons during the impulsive phase of an x - class solar flare , as determined from hxr observations , gets redistributed across the optical , uv , and euv portions of the spectrum throughout the duration of the event , with particular emphasis on continuum processes .",
    "the details of the parent electron distribution are provided as input parameters for numerical simulations that can model the response of the lower solar atmosphere to an injection of energy . the output generated by such models",
    "can then be directly compared with the observed chromospheric response .",
    "such comparisons provide a better understanding of the dominant radiation processes during flares @xcite and information on the depth at which various line and continuum emission processes take place , and the mechanism(s ) responsible for generating them .",
    "section  [ data_anal ] describes how the data from each instrument were analyzed .",
    "the findings from this analysis are presented in section  [ results ] , while their implications are presented and discussed in section  [ conc ] .",
    "on 2011 february 15 the first x - class flare of solar cycle 24 , an x2.2 flare that began at 01:44  ut ( sol2011 - 02 - 15t01:56 ) , occurred in noaa active region 11158 ( solar x = 417 , solar y = -433 ) .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves of the event are shown in figure  [ goes_hsi ] .",
    "this event and its parent active region were extensively observed by a broad range of space - based solar observatories , resulting in over 30 published papers to date .",
    "it is this extensive coverage that makes it an ideal candidate for studying the atmospheric response to an injection of energy , assumed to be in the form of a beam of nonthermal electrons .",
    "data from the ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; @xcite ) were used to measure the energy flux of the electrons assumed to be responsible for driving the enhanced chromospheric emission ( section  [ rhessi ] ) . the euv variability experiment ( eve ; @xcite )",
    "instrument onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; @xcite ) provided full - disk observations of the free - bound euv continua ( lyman , , and ) , as well as the chromospheric 304  and 1216  lines at 10  s cadence ( section  [ eve ] ) , while the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) , also on sdo , provided measurements of the uv continuum in its 1600  and 1700  passbands at 24  s cadence ( section  [ aia ] ) .",
    "finally , the optical continuum at 4504 , 5550 , and 6684 , as well as the h line at 3968 , were recorded by the solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) onboard hinode at 20  s cadence . in this section",
    "the data analysis techniques for each instrument are described .",

    "rhessi was designed to provide high - resolution imaging and spectroscopy of these emissions .",
    "if the hxr emission is chromospheric , it is reasonable to assume thick - target interactions , and under this assumption the parameters of the electron spectrum can be deduced from the measured photon spectrum . the total power contained in the electron distribution ( @xmath62 ) can be calculated using : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the electron distribution in the form of a power - law given by @xmath65  ( electrons  s@xmath6  kev@xmath6 ) .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath66 , is proportional to the total injected electron rate , @xmath67 is the electron energy , @xmath68 is the low - energy cutoff , and @xmath69 the spectral index of the electron distribution .",
    "the expression for @xmath62 therefore becomes :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the conversion factor from kev to erg ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "while rhessi can be used to deduce the electron spectral index very accurately , there are large uncertainties associated with the values determined for the low - energy cutoff because the dominance of thermal emission at low energies makes it harder to identify @xcite .",
    "this leads to a lower limit on the total energy contained in the electron distribution , due to the value of @xmath68 being taken as an upper limit .        the impulsive phase of the 2011 february 15 event lasted for @xmath7310 minutes .",
    "rhessi spectra were compiled for ten 60  s integrations ( denoted by the vertical dashed lines in figure  [ goes_hsi ] ) for each of the nine germanium detectors individually , and were fitted with the sum of a thermal component that dominated at low energies and a collisional thick - target model with a power - law electron spectrum at higher energies ( thick2_vnorm ) .",
    "the thermal component was assumed to be isothermal for the rise phase and decay phase of the event .",
    "however , for the 5 time bins around the peak of the flare ( 01:51:4801:56:48 ut ) the count spectra were better fit with a multi - thermal component with a dem of power law in log t ( see sample rhessi spectrum in figure  [ hsi_spec ] ) .",
    "a similar technique was employed by @xcite .",
    "taking the mean and standard deviation of each fit parameter across individual detectors currently provides the best estimates of the spectral parameters and their uncertainties ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite ) . compiling spectra for each of rhessi s detectors individually also allows the most up - to - date albedo @xcite , pulse pileup , and gain offset estimates currently available in the ospex software package to be used .",
    "dividing the power contained in the electrons by the footpoint area over which their energy is deposited allows the electron energy flux ( in ) to be determined .",
    "it is assumed that rhessi hxr images of flare footpoints are largely unresolved , similar to flare ribbons @xcite , in contrast to wl images of flare ribbons which are resolved @xcite .",
    "figure  [ hsi_sot ] shows an image of the flare ribbons for this event as observed by sot in the h line at 01:53:39  ut . overlaid are the contours of the concurrent 2550  kev emission observed by rhessi , reconstructed using the clean algorithm ( detectors 28 , with a clean beam width factor of 2 ) .",
    "sot images were manually shifted by solar x = + 28  and solar y = + 22  to align with those from rhessi .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the area obtained from rhessi images would be an overestimate of the true region over which the beam energy was deposited .",
    "therefore , the pixels with intensities @xmath480% of the peak emission in each h image ( black contours around the brightest emission in figure  [ hsi_sot ] ) were summed to give a more realistic estimate of the footpoint area for use in determining the electron beam flux density as a function of time ( see below ) .        figure  [ ebeam_params]a shows the count rate of hxr emission ( corrected for changes in attenuator states ) in five energy bands as observed by rhessi .",
    "panels b  d show the evolution of the total electron rate , spectral index , and low - energy cutoff , respectively , as determined from the thick - target model fitted to the rhessi spectra over the course of the flare for detectors 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 individually ( colored symbols ) .",
    "the solid black dots denote the mean value of each parameter by averaging over these six detectors at each time ( these values are also listed in table  [ hsi_beam_params ] along with their 1@xmath74 uncertainties ) .",
    "figure  [ ebeam_params]b reveals that the mean total electron number rate increased by almost 2 orders of magnitude during the first 3 minutes of the event , after which it began to decrease .",
    "the low - energy cutoff ( upper limit ; figure  [ ebeam_params]d ) stayed between 21  kev and 26  kev for the duration of the event .",
    "also plotted are the footpoint areas from sot ( figure  [ ebeam_params]e ) .",
    "sot was not observing at the beginning of the impulsive phase , so the first two data points were estimated by extrapolating back in time linearly from the first two measured data points . the total area derived from sot images",
    "was found to increase until the end of the impulsive phase , while the corresponding area returned from rhessi images remained fairly constant over the course of the flare ( @xmath75  @xmath7 ) .",
    "figure  [ ebeam_params ] ( bottom panel ) shows the evolution of the electron energy flux ( in ) by taking the mean power derived at each time interval ( from equation  [ p_nth ] ) and dividing by the associated footpoint area from sot .",
    "these values are also listed in table  [ hsi_beam_params ] .",
    "the electron energy flux appeared to mimic the total electron rate , peaking 3 minutes into the event , after which it decreased back to its initial value .",
    "error bars denote the 1@xmath74 standard deviations of the total power across all six detectors , although in actuality , the values quoted ought to be considered as lower limits given that the low - energy cutoff values are upper limits , as are the footpoint areas , assuming a filling factor of unity .",

    "the megs - b component ( 3701060 ) , which covers the he i and lyman continua , and the megs - p broadband diode centred on the line at 1216 , have a reduced duty cycle due to unforeseen instrument degradation .",
    "although eve was primarily designed to monitor changes in the sun s euv irradiance over multiple timescales , several studies have shown that its data can be utilized to probe the physical parameters of solar flare plasmas at high cadence ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this section describes how eve data were used to quantify the energy emitted in euv lines and continua formed in the chromosphere over the course of the flare .    , before ( top panel ) and after ( bottom panel ) background subtraction .",
    "grey shaded areas are bounded by fits to the upper and lower limits of each continuum , using the uncertainty estimates from the eve database.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]          @xcite initially presented observations from eve that showed unambiguous , spectrally and temporally - resolved detections of enhanced free - bound ( and free - free ) continua during the flare presented here .",
    "that study was conducted using version 2 of eve data , and an _ ad hoc _ method was employed to obtain time profiles of the free - bound emission .",
    "line - free portions of the eve spectra based on a synthetic flare spectrum from chianti were averaged and fit with an exponential function . in this revised analysis ,",
    "a more robust technique was developed and applied to version 4 data along with the associated uncertainties as provided by the eve database .    as the and lyman continua ( megs - b ) are both evident in quiet - sun spectra",
    ", they were both fit with a power - law function in wavelength using the random sample consensus ( ransac ) method ( @xcite ; see appendix for details ) .",
    "ransac is a method to determine the parameters of a function used to represent an observational dataset that includes outliers .",
    "this approach is best suited for fitting the continua in the megs - b spectral range as it treats the emission lines superimposed on the continua , which vary in intensity throughout a flare , as outliers .",
    "a straightforward , least - squares fit to all the data points in this part of the spectrum would be biased by these lines and would not give a true representation of the continuum alone .",
    "the inliers for the continuum were fitted between 470  and the recombination edge at 504 , and then extrapolated down to 370 , while the lyman continuum inliers were fitted from 700  to the lyman edge at 912 , and then extrapolated down to the edge at 504  ( see figure  [ eve_megsb_cont_fits ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the eve megs - b data are shown in figure  [ eve_megsb_cont_fits ] in grey .",
    "the upper and lower boundaries to each continua were also fit using the ransac method . by integrating under these fits , lightcurves of the ( full - sun ) free - bound continua and their uncertainties",
    "were derived ( top panel of figure  [ eve_megsb_cont_ltc ] ) . subtracting out a pre - flare background and converting from flux values ( w  m@xmath76 ) to power ( ) revealed how the energy radiated by these continua changed as a function of time during the flare ( bottom panel of figure  [ eve_megsb_cont_ltc ] ) .",
    "the lyman continuum had a peak radiative loss rate of @xmath77  , while the continuum peaked around @xmath78  .",
    "the continuum ( megs - a ) , on the other hand , is not immediately evident outside of flaring conditions as it is inherently weak .",
    "it also competes with the free - free ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) continuum , which is also brighter during flares , and therefore required a different fitting technique . @xcite",
    "used eve megs - a data ( version 3 ) to quantify the amount of free - free emission ( and free - bound in the case of the 211  channel ) that contributed to each of the euv passbands on aia .",
    "they were able to fit an exponential function to the lower envelope of the eve spectra by differentiating twice with respect to wavelength to identify the local minima ( essentially , the ` turning points ' between emission lines ) .",

    "there have been relatively few flares reported in the literature ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "although the megs - p response function is 100  wide , more than 99% of the detected emission is solar after accounting for non - solar sources ( e.g. , geocoronal emission ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the channel is a photodiode versus a ccd for the other megs channels , so the high - energy particles in the sdo orbit cause spikes in the data time series as opposed to just affecting a pixel or two on the ccd sensors . the data processing algorithms attempt to make a correction for these spikes in the data time series , but",

    "the observations of the h line show two clearly defined flare ribbons that had already brightened by the time that observations began ( figure  [ hsi_sot ] ) .",
    "these ribbons evolve as the flare progresses , with the brightest part of the eastern ribbon moving northward , and that of the western ribbon moving southwards .",
    "the western ribbon appears brightest in two portions , with a region of lower intensity between the two . in the later stages of the observations there",
    "also appears to be some low intensity flows between the ribbons .",
    "flaring sources were identified by selecting pixels with an intensity greater than the mean - plus-10@xmath74 , where the mean and standard deviation , @xmath74 , were defined from a region of quiet sun ( the area between @xmath73160  and @xmath73240  in the solar x - direction and between @xmath73 - 200  and @xmath73 - 180  in the solar y - direction ) .",
    "the total instantaneous power emitted by flare - enhanced sources was calculated by summing the power emitted by each flaring pixel using the same expression for @xmath101 quoted in section  [ optical_continuum ] .",
    "background intensity was measured by taking the mean intensity of the same quiet sun region defined above .",
    "the power emitted is shown in figure  [ sot_caii_ltc ] , and is generally on the order @xmath7310@xmath102  erg s@xmath6 . integrating over time",
    ", the energy radiated as h line emission was determined to be @xmath103  erg .    by the time that sot began taking data in response to the flare trigger",
    ", the calcium ribbons were already flaring , which is why the background - subtracted power is significantly above zero at the beginning of the observations .",
    "the h line intensity had not returned to background levels before the end of the sot observations , with material continuing to radiate while cooling , so the value of energy quoted above is a lower limit on the total energy .",
    "in this section , the energetics derived from each emission process analysed individually in section  [ data_anal ] are combined and compared . figure  [ flare_ltc]a shows the corrected count rate hxr time profiles as measured by rhessi for the main phase of the event to guide the reader .",
    "the evolution of the power contained in the nonthermal electrons , as derived from rhessi data using the methods described in section  [ rhessi ] , is shown in figure  [ flare_ltc]b .",
    "power derived from each individual detector ( 36 , 8 , and 9 ) is shown as a colored histogram , while the mean value at each time interval is plotted as a thick , solid black curve .",
    "this profile shows a rapid increase in electron power over the first 3 minutes of the flare , peaking at @xmath104  . by integrating under this curve ,",
    "the total energy contained in the electron beam that was deposited in the chromosphere over the 10-minute impulsive phase was found to be @xmath105  erg , which should be taken as a lower limit as the low - energy cutoff is an upper limit .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ flare_ltc ] shows each of the lightcurves ( also in units of ) derived in sections  [ eve ] , [ aia ] , and [ sot ] .",
    "almost all of the profiles peak around the time of maximum energy deposition .",
    "the curve peaked @xmath735  minutes later , while the continuum had a more gradual rise phase due to the presence of a strong , underlying free - free continuum in the flare s early stages .",
    "hinode / sot was not observing at high cadence in its white light channels during the early impulsive phase and so data were only available from 01:5002:00  ut . by summing the integrals under each lightcurve ,",
    "the total energy radiated by the chromosphere as measured by eve , aia , and sot was calculated to be @xmath106  erg .",

    "the sed plots of the flare excess energy for the 2011 february 15 flare are shown in figure  [ flare_energy_spec ] with both linear and logarithmic y - axes .",
    "the advantage of such a plot is that equal areas denote equal energies , for a linear y - axis , so that the dominant contributions appear at a glance .",
    "figure  [ flare_energy_spec ] shows that a blackbody interpretation of the broad - band visible continuum might dominate , but that there are substantial gaps in the infrared , visible , and uv range that might turn out to be important .",
    "this paper presents a multi - wavelength analysis of the energy radiated by the lower solar atmosphere in response to energy deposited by nonthermal electrons during the impulsive phase of an x - class flare .",
    "the parameters of the nonthermal electrons assumed to be driving chromospheric heating and radiation were obtained using hxr data from rhessi , while the corresponding response as determined from euv , uv , and wl emission was measured by sdo / eve , sdo / aia , and hinode / sot , respectively . the total energy contained in the nonthermal electrons ( @xmath0  erg ) could comfortably account for that radiated away by the chromosphere over all passbands ( @xmath106  erg ) . by comparison , the amount of energy liberated by the eruption of this event has been calculated using non - linear force free field extrapolations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who found that @xmath123  erg , @xmath124  erg , and @xmath125  erg were released , respectively .",
    "each of these values can satisfactorily account for the amount of energy that went into the accelerating the nonthermal particles .    while this study illustrates",
    "how energy deposited in the chromosphere during a major flaring event is re - radiated across the visible and e / uv parts of the solar spectrum , it says nothing about how the electron energy is transferred to the lower layers in particular , nor the depth at which the various line and continuum emissions originate .",
    "this can only be determined through imaging of near - limb events or advanced numerical modelling .",
    "the nonthermal electron parameters plotted in figure  [ ebeam_params ] and tabulated in table  [ hsi_beam_params ] therefore offer observational constraints with which to generate a chromospheric heating function based on actual measurements .",
    "the simulated solar atmosphere can then be directly compared with the observed lightcurves ( and intensities ) of chromospheric emission from sdo / eve , sdo / aia , and hinode / sot to reveal the physics of energy transport .",
    "there are , of course , several limitations to this approach .",
    "current models are not yet capable of solving the equations of non - equilibrium and non - lte optically - thick radiative transfer in multiple dimensions , and do not attempt to follow the structural changes ( e.g. , in mhd ) of the flaring atmosphere . in reality",
    ", flares are complex and dynamic three - dimensional structures . large x - class flares often comprise an arcade of loops , each heating a different part of the lower atmosphere .",
    "this is evident from footpoint motions such as those shown in figure  [ sot_wl_image ] .",
    "the observations presented here have been spatially integrated for ease of comparison .",
    "eve does not provide any spatial information , and rhessi does not resolve individual footpoints .",
    "nonetheless , it would be informative to undertake such a comparison to see if any current models are capable of reproducing the observed lightcurves .",
    "significant departures from observations may be attributed , first of all , to the uncertainty in the low - energy cutoff determined from rhessi spectra . as mentioned in section  [ rhessi ] , this is an upper limit and therefore may be treated as a ` free parameter ' when used in modelling to bring the synthetic time profiles in - line with observations .",
    "consequently , such an analysis could be seen as a consistency check on fits to rhessi spectra : a match between theory and observations would imply that the measured value of @xmath68 was accurate .",
    "another significant uncertainty lies in the area over which the energy is deposited . as can be seen in figure  [ ebeam_params]e",
    ", areas derived from rhessi and sot images can differ by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this can lead to similar discrepancies in the electron energy flux .",
    "if filling factors were revealed to be much less than unity in sot images , then the energy fluxes could be in excess of 10@xmath126  , perhaps even closer to 10@xmath127  .",
    "if predicted and measured chromospheric emission still differ having exhausted some or all of these factors , then alternative energy transport mechanisms may need to be considered ( e.g. alfvn waves ; @xcite ) .",
    "multi - wavelength studies such as that presented here illustrate the value of bringing together observations over a broad spectral range , but also highlight the need for the inclusion of additional coverage , particularly those from ground - based instruments such as rosa (  k , , blue continuum , g - band ; @xcite ) .",
    "information on the doppler velocity of the evaporating ( or condensing ) plasma from instruments such as the euv imaging spectrometer @xcite onboard hinode , or the recently launched interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ; @xcite ) would give a more complete picture of the response of the lower solar atmosphere during solar flares .    despite this flare having great spectral coverage from space - based instrumentation , and at high cadence , only 15% of the energy deposited in the lower solar atmosphere was observed .",
    "the inclusion of additional observations for future events would allow a more comprehensive sed plot to be compiled , and ideally , compared with bolometric measurements .",
    "this would help point to the ` missing ' 85% of the energy and reveal how it is distributed throughout the solar atmosphere .",
    "numerical modelling could also help in this regard ; by accurately reproducing the observations that were available , they should be able to predict those that were not .",
