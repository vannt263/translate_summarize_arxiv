    "one of the active areas of high energy physics research has been exploration of the so called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram . in particular , with the advent of ultrarelativistic heavy ion beams at rhic and cern and with the upcoming facilities of gsi where compressed baryonic matter is expected to be produced , such studies have assumed special importance . beside the laboratory experiments , various astrophysical objects like neutron stars , quark stars ,",
    "provide natural sites where many of the theoretical conjectures about the various phases of quark matter can be tested .",
    "the latter , in the present context , is more relevant here , as we study the possibility of para - ferro phase transition in dense quark system interacting via one gluon exchange .",
    "the original idea about para - ferro phase transition in quark matter was proposed recently in @xcite where the possibility of bloch like phase transition @xcite was studied and it was shown that spin polarized quark matter might exist at low density @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of such a phase transition is analogous to what was originally proposed for the degenerate electron gas @xcite .",
    "there , for coulomb interaction , it was shown that the exchange correction to the energy is attractive which at the low density wins over the kinetic energy giving rise to a ferromagnetic state @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a variational calculation has been performed to show that it is indeed possible to have a spin polarized quark matter at low density of strange quark system , while for light quark it never happens @xcite .",
    "similar difference of the light and strange quark matter , albeit in a different context , was observed earlier @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite , it was shown that both the light and heavy flavor systems can exhibit such phase transitions although the critical density for the strange matter is higher than the light quark systems .",
    "such investigations , have also been performed in @xcite and also in @xcite where the calculation has been extended to include thermal effects .",
    "the bloch like phase transition , for strange quark , has also been reconfirmed in @xcite .",
    "one shortcoming of all these works including @xcite , has been that the calculations were restricted to the hartree fock level and the terms beyond the exchange diagrams , commonly termed as correlation energy @xcite were ignored . without such corrections , however , the calculations are known to remain incomplete as the higher order terms are plagued with infrared divergences arising out of the exchange of massless gluons , indicating the failure of the naive perturbation series .",
    "we know that this problem can be cured by reorganizing the perturbation theory where a particular class of diagrams , _ viz . _",
    "the bubbles are resummed in order to obtain a finite result .",
    "originally , as is well known , this was done by gell - mann and brueckner @xcite while calculating the ground state energy of degenerate electron gas .",
    "the contribution of the bubbles involve terms of @xmath5 indicating non - perturbative nature of the correction @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "as announced , we calculate the spin susceptibility @xmath6 of dense quark system with corrections due to correlations _",
    "i.e. _ containing terms upto @xmath5 .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the ground state energy ( gse ) of spin polarized matter with inclusion of bubble diagrams .",
    "the gse of the polarized quark matter has been calculated only recently in @xcite which is the starting point of the present paper .",
    "this work is very similar to that of brueckner and swada @xcite and those of @xcite , applied to the case of qcd matter .",
    "unlike , degenerate electron gas , however , we have both the electric and magnetic interactions and the calculation is performed relativistically , while the non - relativistic results appear as a limit .",
    "the spin susceptibility @xmath0 , for quark matter upto @xmath7 has already been calculated in ref.@xcite which we only briefly discuss .",
    "subsequently , the non - fermi liquid corrections to @xmath0 has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "these studies provide further motivation to undertake the present endeavor to include correlation corrections , without which , as mentioned already , the perturbative evaluation of @xmath8 remains incomplete .",
    "in addition , we also calculate incompressibility and sound velocity for spin polarized quark matter with corrections due to correlations which involve evaluation of single particle energy at the fermi surface .",
    "these quantities are of special interests for applications to astrophysics .",
    "moreover , we also evaluate the exchange energy density at non - zero temperature and determine the corresponding corrections to the spin susceptibility .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we calculate spin susceptibility with correlation correction for degenerate quark matter .",
    "analytic expressions are presented both in ultra - relativistic ( ur ) and non - relativistic ( nr ) limit . in sec .",
    "iii , we evaluate exchange energy density and spin - susceptibility at non - zero temperature . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize and conclude .",
    "detailed expressions of the intermediate expressions , from which @xmath0 is derived , have been relegated to the appendix .",
    "the spin susceptibility of quark matter is determined by the change in energy of the system as its spins are polarized @xcite .",
    "we introduce a polarization parameter @xmath9 with the condition @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to densities of spin - up and spin - down quarks respectively , and @xmath13 denotes total quark density .",
    "the fermi momenta in the spin - polarized quark matter then are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , is the fermi momentum of the unpolarized matter @xmath17 . in the small @xmath18 limit , the ground state energy behaves like @xcite    [ xi_expan ] e()&= & e(=0)+_s^2+o(^4 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath19 , defined to be the spin stiffness constant in analogy with @xcite .",
    "the spin susceptibility @xmath0 is proportional to the inverse of the spin stiffness , mathematically @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that in eq.([xi_expan ] ) , the first term corresponds to unpolarized matter energy .",
    "now , the leading contributions to the ground state energy are given by the three terms _ viz .",
