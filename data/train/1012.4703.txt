    "the investigation of fluctuations and correlations , i.e. an event - by - event analysis , of high energy heavy ion collision data has been ongoing for several years  @xcite .",
    "recently , this discussion was refreshed  @xcite in the view that ( event - by - event ) fluctuations of multiplicity , or of ratios of multiplicities , might serve as an observable to pin down the critical behavior of the collective , and potentially at some point of its evolution thermalized , system created when two heavy ions collide .",
    "thus , the measurement of ratio fluctuations might make it possible to fix the values of temperature and baryon chemical potential of a critical point ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in the phase diagram of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss the problems and possible caveats of such an analysis .",
    "an event - by - event analysis ultimately deals with ( joint ) distributions of a certain set of observables .",
    "parameters such as mean value , variance , skewness and kurtosis can be employed to describe the shape of a distribution obtained .",
    "their values , as the distribution obtained itself , will depend on many experimental factors .",
    "more complicated measures are often lacking a clear interpretation .",
    "in particular we will investigate the commonly used measure of dynamical ratio fluctuations .",
    "it is not the aim of this paper to suggest an improved observable or method capable of locating a critical point of strongly interacting matter , or one that could potentially be indicative of new physics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to discuss caveats of the existing methods which are usually not mentioned in the literature .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_generalcons ]",
    "we formulate some rather general statements about the particularities of an event - by - event analysis . in section  [ sec_ratiofluc ]",
    "we then focus on a particular method and discuss some difficulties one might face with its interpretation .",
    "a discussion of specific experimental and theoretical studies can be found in section  [ sec_discussion ] .",
    "some concluding remarks are summarized in section  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "let us start by making a rather general observation .",
    "the statistical properties of a sample of events depend on the rules chosen to select this sample from an even larger sample of events , and on the degree of completeness of the information available about each member of this sample . in the context of heavy ion collision physics",
    "these two aspects translate into centrality class construction from minimum bias data , and an experiments capabilities of particle identification and momentum measurement .",
    "we will elaborate on these aspects in the following .",
    "we first discuss centrality selection .",
    "two heavy ions collide with relativistic momenta .",
    "being extended objects , they can do so in a variety of different ways . roughly the following rule should apply ( in the average sense ) : the larger the interaction region , the more particles of each species are produced . however , the initial state of the collision can not be observed directly .",
    "all that can be observed is the final state . from this one",
    "can then infer the likelihood of a certain initial state . yet , each single possible final state observable will generally suggest a slightly different initial state .",
    "hence , the need arises to average over centrality classes .",
    "the problem is then : within any such a centrality class will be events with rather different initial states , altering the true correlation between two observables .",
    "results will depend on , in particular , which trigger was chosen to construct these centrality classes , or sub - samples , of events .    to illustrate this point we refer to fig .",
    "[ hsd_centrality ] .",
    "shown is a result of a hsd transport simulation , taken from  @xcite .",
    "the two observables shown in fig .",
    "[ hsd_centrality ] are the number of participating ( or wounded ) nucleons  @xmath0 , and the multiplicity of charged final state hadrons  @xmath1 in a mid - rapidity acceptance window .",
    "this analysis is somewhat hypothetical , but serves to illustrate a crucial point : depending on which one of the two observables is used to define the sample of  @xmath2 most central events , two rather different sub - samples , indicated by the vertical and horizontal lines , are created .",
    "these two samples could possibly have rather different statistical properties .",
    "the two methods are hence not equivalent , and both introduce their very own bias .",
    "it deserves to be stressed that the smaller the centrality class intervals ( here  @xmath3 ) are chosen the more distinct are the sub - samples obtained from two different trigger conditions .",
    "the second aspect we want to discuss is particle acceptance . by this we mean particle identification , momentum measurement , and ultimately the geometric coverage of the interaction region by the detector .",
    "we ignore for now centrality selection and think of a perfectly prepared initial state , and explore two limiting cases .",
    "the first one being the ideal detector .",
    "all final state particles are observed , and any correlation can be measured to any degree .",
    "the opposite limit would be a very bad detector , capable of only detecting a particle every once in a while .",
    "such a detector could surely measure the ratios of the occurrence of particles of different species ( provided sufficient particle identification capabilities ) and hence allows for a comparison of model results for ratios of averaged particle multiplicities to actual data  @xcite",
    ". however it would be completely unable to inform us how the multiplicities of different particle species within one event are correlated or how this correlation would change in different segments of momentum space .",
    "any realistic detector is in between these limits .    also here fig .",
    "[ hsd_centrality ] can serve as an illustration . changing the acceptance window for charged final state hadrons  @xmath1 , which was for",
    "the purpose of this analysis located around mid - rapidity ( while assuming that  @xmath0 can still be measured with the same accuracy ) , will change the marginal distribution  @xmath4 .",
    "in particular mean value , variance , skewness , and kurtosis of the marginal distribution  @xmath5 are affected .",
    "the distribution  @xmath5 is often used as a reference distribution for construction of centrality classes by collider experiments . that means , depending on the value  @xmath1 of a particular event , one assigns this event to a certain centrality class .",
    "above considerations served to emphasize the importance of the way by which a certain data set was constructed and the degree of completeness of the information available about each element of ones data set .",
    "these two aspects also determine whether two data sets can really be compared to each other .",
    "we now focus on one method , the measurement of the fluctuations of the ratio of particle multiplicities , while leaving it to the reader to decide whether or not some aspects of this discussion could be shared by other methods .",
    "firstly a plain observation : independent of a particular analysis technique , what is considered here is the ratio of two observables .",
    "each of which will have a certain value in each event . directly",
    "( as done e.g. in the star experiment  @xcite ) or indirectly ( as done e.g. in the na49 experiment  @xcite ) one can obtain then the ratio of these two observables . in the following",
    "we will focus on the numbers of particles of a certain species in each event .",
    "we again consider construction of centrality classes and the window of particle acceptance available . in general",
    "one can conclude that the joint ( 2 dimensional ) distribution  @xmath6 of the multiplicities of the two species @xmath7 and @xmath8 of particles will be determined by the choices of solutions to the two aforementioned aspects , i.e. acceptance and centrality selection .",
    "the distribution of ratios ,  @xmath9 , being constructed from the joint distribution , is then certainly no exception .    a measure for quantifying the width of the distribution of ratios  @xmath9 , similar to the ones used by the star @xcite and na49 collaboration @xcite , could read : @xmath10    here  @xmath11 denotes the variance of observable  @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 denotes the mean value of the observable  @xmath12 , and  @xmath14 denotes the co - variance of the observables  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 .",
    "the above discussion about centrality selection and particle acceptance certainly does not do justice to all the technical details which will ultimately determine the shape of the joint distribution  @xmath6 of the two observables  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 .",
    "yet , all five terms , which make up the measure depend strongly on many of these aspects . hence , there is no reason to believe that the measure  @xmath17 , given in eq .",
    "[ themeasure ] , would not depend on them .",
    "the need arises then to remove the bias introduced .",
    "the mixed event background subtraction should remove all `` trivial '' correlations due to acceptance and centrality selection , while leaving all `` physical '' correlation unchanged .",
    "note , that different mixing procedures have been suggested  @xcite , but since they do not change the argumentation of our analysis we do not comment on them separately . before focusing on the mixed event background , let us make another observations about the measure  @xmath17 .",
    "this measure , being so general , could be applied to any sample , as long as the observables  @xmath18 are positive integers .",
    "independent of what  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 may represent .",
    "this implies that also the event mixing procedure , once it is specified , could be applied to a more general ( or plainly different and  [ thedynamicalmeasure ] . ] ) system with observables  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider a particular event mixing procedure similar to the one used by the na49 collaboration .",
    "firstly a reference distribution  @xmath19 of the observable  @xmath20 is constructed : @xmath21    a mixed distribution  @xmath22 can be obtained by sampling the reference distribution  @xmath19 and assigning the values for  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 according to a binomial distribution .",
    "the mixed event background distribution is then : @xmath23 where  @xmath24 is the probability that a randomly drawn particle is of species  @xmath7. the distributions  @xmath19 and  @xmath25 are then identical",
    ".    stated differently , once the distribution  @xmath6 is chosen ( or fixed ) , then also the new mixed background @xmath22 is similarly determined .",
    "this is to say , for any generic distribution  @xmath26 a mixed background and the measure of dynamical ratio fluctuations @xmath27 are equally determined .",
    "this is independent of what  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 represent , and independent of how the original data set came about .",
    "we are considering the example of a bi - variate normal distribution ( bnd ) , with five parameters : marginal variances  @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , their co - variance  @xmath30 , and two mean values ,  @xmath31 , and  @xmath32 . having specified these values , and having decided which event - mixing procedure should be applied , the measures ,  @xmath33 ,  @xmath34 , and  @xmath35 , can be straightforwardly obtained .",
    "this implies the existence of a four - dimensional hyper - surface in this parameter space representing bnds with an equal amount  @xmath35 of dynamical ratio fluctuations .",
    "let us explore the limit of a bnd , fig .",
    "[ mixed_event_correlations ]  ( _ left _ ) , with completely correlated observables  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath36 between them is then  @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio of  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 here in this example is then always equal to unity .",
    "the same will not be true for the mixed event background , fig .",
    "[ mixed_event_correlations ]  ( _ right _ ) , where the correlation will be weaker ,  @xmath38 . following above event mixing procedure , one then quickly finds  @xmath39 ,  @xmath40 , and  @xmath41 . in words , despite the fact that the ratio is always one , the measure , discussed in eqs .",
    "[ themeasure ] and  [ thedynamicalmeasure ] , suggests a degree of negative dynamical ratio fluctuations for this distribution .    also other limiting cases could be explored .",
    "here we mention the class of bnds with co - variance  @xmath42 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 3d_correlations ] .",
    "the distribution  @xmath6 then factorizes into the product of two normal distributions  @xmath43 . for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ 3d_correlations ] , a bnd with mean values  @xmath44 , and co - variance  @xmath45 was chosen . in fig .",
    "[ 3d_correlations ] the resulting co - variance of the mixed event background  @xmath46  ( _ left _ ) and the measure . ] of dynamical ratio fluctuations  @xmath47  ( _ right _ ) are shown in their dependence on the variances  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 .",
    "in general one finds  @xmath48 after event mixing , i.e. the mixed event background now contains correlations , which the original sample did not .",
    "having formulated rather general statements about the particularities of an event - by - event analysis of heavy ion collision data , and having discussed a specific fluctuation measure , we feel the need to add a few more specific comments .",
    "measurements of fluctuations and correlations of particle multiplicities are often mentioned with regard to the detection of a critical point in the qcd phase diagram or other predictions for the properties of yet to be observed new states of matter .",
    "certain aspects of distributions are supposed to shed light on their ( temporary ) formation . given the caveats discussed throughout this paper the authors are less optimistic .",
    "the effects discussed above are hard to quantify as this would have to be done specifically and systematically .",
    "the biases introduced by a particular centrality selection criterion and a given particle acceptance would have to be studied separately for each observable .",
    "focus should be put on the different solutions realized in the two main groups of experimental set - ups , fixed target and collider geometries .",
    "this was not the aim of this paper . yet some examples can be quoted .",
    "here we want to refer to a recent review paper  @xcite , summarizing the phd thesis of v.  konchakovski .",
    "in particular we mention sections 6 and 8 .",
    "the first example we want to quote is the correlation coefficient  @xcite between the multiplicities of charged hadrons in two narrow symmetrically around mid - rapidity arranged acceptance intervals , usually termed ",
    "forward - backward correlations  .",
    "these correlations have been studied in their dependence on choice of centrality trigger and size of centrality classes  @xcite .",
    "a wider definition of centrality classes leads to a stronger correlation between forward and backward hemispheres .",
    "a larger system will have lots of particles in both acceptance windows .",
    "a smaller system will obviously have less particles .",
    "combining systems of different sizes into one sample will lead to ( strong ) correlations in this sample from geometric considerations alone .",
    "a different choice of the centrality trigger will results in a different centrality dependence of ones observable .",
    "no unambigous ( final state ) measure is available to select only events of the  same ( initial ) system size  into one sample .    for the second example we want to return to the fluctuations of hadron multiplicity ratios .",
    "an hsd simulation of heavy ion collisions has been performed for several center of mass energies . at low center of mass energy",
    "the data was analyzed twice .",
    "once for the na49 acceptance for 3.5% most central collisions selected via the projectile spectator nucleon signal , and once for the star acceptance for 5% most central collisions selected via the reference charged hadron multiplicity distribution . from above considerations differences between these two set - ups are to be expected",
    "the situation is summarized as follows  @xcite : for some ratios of the multiplicities of selected hadrons stronger differences between the two samples emerge than for others .",
    "given our difficulty to interpret the measure of dynamical ratio fluctuations , we find it hard to make a positive conclusion about the apparent numerical similarity of the results of the na49  @xcite and star  @xcite collaborations .",
    "it is equally hard to disentangle different contributions to ones fluctuation and correlation signals .",
    "the fact remains that correlation must not be confused with causation .",
    "we cordially acknowledge the commonly quoted motivation for performing statistical analysis of heavy ion collision data .",
    "however the ( conjectured ) effects to be investigated , or hoped to be discovered and established , are not the only factors determining the statistical properties of ones data sample .",
    "the view that a ( sharp ) non - monotonic behavior of a suitably chosen observable evaluated on a suitably constructed and modified data set can straightforwardly be taken as evidence for new physics ( e.g. the detection of a critical point ) is not held by the authors .",
    "this discussion largely fell into two parts , each of which tried to raise two points .",
    "firstly the results of any event - by - event analysis do depend strongly on how one constructs sub - samples from minimum bias data .",
    "minimum bias data from different experimental set - ups can vary quite strongly , and no initial state can be observed . secondly , and",
    "equally important , is an experiments capability to record accurate and detailed information about each event .",
    "the patchier the data set the less detailed and conclusive any analysis of it , or comparison to another data set , can be .",
    "we then discussed a particular procedure . also here",
    "we tried to raise two points .",
    "firstly a lot of information is discarded in favor of a single number ,  @xmath49 .",
    "this number might not be very indicative of a systems properties . secondly , plainly constructing a reference distribution from a given data distribution according to some set of rules does not necessarily help to subtract correlations .",
    "unfortunately no reference ( data ) sample ( where a certain effect is simply not contained ) is available in high energy heavy ion collision physics .    given above considerations we find it hard to compare and interpret results from different experiments .",
    "especially the dependence on the center of mass energy of the colliding ions might then carry little information .",
