    "recently , there has been much progress in our understanding of the process of nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations agree well with the rhic @xmath1 data of the elliptic flow at low transverse momentum @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "however , they can not predict the saturation of @xmath1 at higher @xmath3 @xcite and the rhic hbt puzzle of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the hbt puzzle is contrary to many earlier theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "various models have been put forth to explain the hbt puzzle @xcite .",
    "there have also been many attempts to provide a consistent explanation for both the elliptic flow and hbt measurements at rhic @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a granular particle - emitting source of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) droplets evolving hydrodynamically was put forth to explain the rhic hbt puzzle .",
    "the suggestion was based on the observation that in the hydrodynamical model @xcite , the particle emission time scales with the initial radius of the droplet .",
    "particles will be emitted earlier if the radius of the droplet is smaller , as in a source of many droplets .",
    "an earlier emission time will lead to a smaller extracted hbt radius @xmath5 , while the extracted hbt radius @xmath6 is determined by the scale of the distribution of the droplets . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath7 can be close to @xmath6 for a granular quark - gluon plasma source @xcite .",
    "further suggestions of using the single - event intensity interferometry to search for the signature for granular structures have also been presented @xcite .    motivated by the successes of our previous analysis of the hbt puzzle using a granular droplet model , we examine in this paper the theoretical basis for the possible occurrence of granular structure in the evolution of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in addition , we wish to refine the granular source model of ref .",
    "@xcite by considering more reasonable anisotropic velocity distributions of the droplets instead of a constant radial velocity assumed in @xcite .",
    "we would like to investigate the pion elliptic flows as well as hbt radii as functions of the pion transverse momentum .",
    "the agreement both of the @xmath1 and hbt radii with experimental data concurrently will gives strong constrains for the granular model and its parameters and will provide a useful insight into the initial state and the evolution of the particle - emitting source produced in high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "based on the recent results of high - energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic , the matter ( presumably qgp ) produced in the collisions may be a strongly - coupled medium with a very high energy density @xcite .",
    "they are thermalized within about 1 fm / c @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to study its subsequent evolution and see whether granular structures may play a role in the space - time development of the presumed quark - gluon plasma matter .",
    "although a granular structure was suggested earlier as the signature of a first - order phase transition @xcite , the occurrence of granular structure may not be limited to the occurrence of a first - order phase transition .",
    "there are additional effects which may lead to the dynamical formation of granular droplets .",
    "because the qgp is a strongly interacting dense medium , a surface tension arises at a boundary due to the presence of a strong interaction in the dense phase on one side of the boundary and the absence ( or weakening ) of the strong interaction with no density ( or diminishing density ) on the other side @xcite .",
    "this imbalance of the forces acting on different parts at the boundary leads to the surface tension , while the detail profile of the boundary may depend on the nature and the order of phase transition . due to the presence of this surface tension",
    ", there may be instability against surface shape changes and bulk density oscillations .",
    "the quark gluon plasma that may be produced in the laboratory is spatially bounded by various boundaries .",
    "furthermore , in many simulations of the heavy - ion collisions on an event - by - event basis , the initial transverse energy density is far from being uniform .",
    "it exhibits large transverse density fluctuations with a large peak - to - valley ratio @xcite .",
    "a large number of transverse density domains are clearly visible in the initial transverse density distribution of the produced matter in fig .",
    "21 of @xcite or fig . 4 of @xcite .",
    "because of these highly fluctuating initial transverse density distribution forming `` lumps '' in different regions , the probability for the occurrence of granular structure may be enhanced .",
    "we can present an approximate scenario to discuss the evolution of matter with a large transverse density fluctuations , in a central collision of two heavy and equal nuclei of radius @xmath8 .",
    "because of lorentz contraction , the longitudinal length @xmath9 of the produced matter is much smaller than the transverse length , which is of the order @xmath8 .",
    "initially as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) , density fluctuations in the transverse plane manifest as a number of transverse lumps characterized by a radius @xmath10 , which one can also see from the results of @xcite and @xcite . from such an initial data",
    ", we can consider the evolution according to landau hydrodynamics @xcite , which gives a good description of the longitudinal distribution of the produced particles @xcite .",
    "in such a description , because the initial longitudinal length is much smaller than the transverse length , the hydrodynamical force per unit volume in the longitudinal direction , @xmath11 , is much greater than the hydrodynamical force per unit volume in the transverse direction , @xmath12 .",
    "the subsequent expansion in the longitudinal direction proceeds much faster than in the transverse direction , as pointed out by landau and belenkii @xcite .",
    "the expanding matter develops into tubes of radius @xmath10 [ fig .",
    "1(@xmath13 ) ] and the density of matter in the tube decreases as a function of the proper time .",
    "schematic description of the matter distribution under a rapid longitudinal expansion in the @xmath14-direction , for a highly fluctuating initial transverse density distribution [ fig .  1@xmath15 .",
    "the system evolves into many longitudinal tubes at fig .",
    "1@xmath13 and later at fig .",
    "sausage instabilities lead to the production of droplets along the longitudinal tubes as depicted in fig .",
    "1@xmath16 . ]",
    "as is well known , a long tube of matter is unstable against `` sausage '' perturbations that tend to make the tube narrow in some regions and thicker in other regions .",
    "the sausage instability leads to the break - up of the long tube of matter into many approximately equal spherical droplets , as in the break - up of toroidal liquid droplets @xcite .",
    "we can examine the sausage instability for a cylinder with a length @xmath17 and a radius @xmath10 , with @xmath18 .",
    "we consider `` sausage '' perturbations @xmath19 about the cylinder of matter , @xmath20 in order to have a positive slope @xmath21 at @xmath22 and a negative slope at @xmath23 , we need to limit ourselves to perturbations with odd values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . by the condition of volume conservation , the quantity @xmath26 is @xmath27 the surface energy of the cylinder is then @xmath28 the cylinder is unstable against perturbations of order @xmath24 if @xmath29 is negative",
    ". we can evaluate @xmath29 and obtain @xmath30 thus , @xmath31 is negative for all odd integer values of @xmath24 . as an unrestrained growth of the perturbation of order",
    "@xmath24 leads the formation of @xmath32 droplets , we find that the cylinder is unstable against perturbations leading to the formation of @xmath33 approximately equal droplets .",
    "thus , when the length @xmath17 of the tubes are stretched , sausage ( granular ) instability will develop and the long tube will fragment into approximately equal - size droplets , as depicted in fig .",
    "2@xmath16 . large density fluctuations in the transverse direction ,",
    "together with the surface tension effects , favor the formation of granular droplets .    in our simplified description , we have ignored the effects of the perturbation on the variation of the transverse surfaces at the two ends of the cylinder .",
    "a refinement on the description of the end surfaces will not modify significantly the question of the instability of the cylindrical matter , for cylinders with @xmath17 substantially greater than @xmath10 .    in conclusion",
    ", we find from the above analysis that the occurrence of granular droplets may be more common than previously thought .",
    "it is of great interest to explore the subsequent dynamics in a granular model for the description of various observables measured in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this is particularly relevant because a granular droplet model can explain the occurrence of early emission of particles and a small value of @xmath5 @xcite .      to carry out the analysis of the effects of surface tension on the stability of density oscillations , we consider the following simple model of the surface tension , as represented by a finite - range interaction",
    "the equation of hydrodynamics without a finite - range interaction is @xcite @xmath34 u^k \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x^k } = -    \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x^i }    -    u_i u^k   \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x^k } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the energy density and pressure . in this hydrodynamical equation ,",

    ". it will be useful to relate @xmath70 to the surface tension coefficient @xmath71 .",
    "for such a purpose , we study the energy of a system with a numbers density profile given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number density in the interior dense region of a surface and @xmath74 is the number density in the outer dilute region . the energy of the system due to the residual interaction of eq .",

    "as is well known , the presence of dynamical quarks has important influences on many thermodynamical properties of the plasma .",
    "the phase transition temperature is altered from 269 mev for quenched qcd without dynamical quarks to 154 mev for full qcd with 3 flavors of quarks @xcite , whereas the surface tension coefficient @xmath71 depends on the temperature approximately as @xmath88 .",

    "its decrease at high @xmath3 is sensitive to the exponential power parameter of the droplet velocity @xmath135 in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the value of @xmath135 is much smaller than that of @xmath134 , indicating different dynamical behaviors in longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "our hbt results further indicate that the granular source has a small lifetime and a possible shell - type spatial distribution .",
    "further studies on the origin of the difference in the transverse and longitudinal dynamics as well as the spatial distribution in the transverse direction will be of great interest .",

    "<S> in many simulations of high - energy heavy - ion collisions on an event - by - event analysis , it is known that the initial energy density distribution in the transverse plane is highly fluctuating . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent longitudinal expansion will lead to many longitudinal tubes of quark - gluon plasma which have tendencies to break up into many spherical droplets because of sausage instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore motivated to use a model of quark - gluon plasma granular droplets that evolve hydrodynamically to investigate pion elliptic flows and hanbury - brown - twiss interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the data of pion transverse momentum spectra , elliptic flows , and hbt radii in @xmath0 gev au + au collisions at rhic can be described well by an expanding source of granular droplets with an anisotropic velocity distribution . </S>"
