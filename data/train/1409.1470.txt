    "the global resurgence of vector - borne diseases is a growing concern for public health officers in many countries @xcite .",
    "diseases like dengue and chikungunya continue to spread all over the world , hand in hand with the spread of their associated vectors ; cf . @xcite . thus , in the united states the _ aedes albopictus _ , the tiger mosquito , is fixating very rapidly , while in europe _ ae . albopictus",
    "_ is also spreading at a fast rate ",
    "the result of this fixation is already evident : italy and the south of france have already had documented cases of chikungunya @xcite , and there is a growing number of dengue cases detected in the us @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dengue is now the leading cause in us of acute febrile state of travelers returning from asian , south american and caribbean countries @xcite . in the particular case of dengue , the main vector , _ ae .",
    "aegypti _ , is anthropophilic , and it lives only on urban or semi - urban areas .",
    "it is also a very sedentary mosquito : it will usually fly no more than about five hundred meters from its birth place , unless in extreme adverse conditions .",
    "these observations suggest that one should not expect that dengue will spread through the diffusion of the vector .",
    "indeed a number of such resurgent diseases occur in highly urban areas and are transmitted by vectors that do not disperse very far compared to other species  cf . @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , in the case of a urban area with an efficient transportation system , movements from one location to another",
    "then , for a given individual , disease transmission will mostly likely happen either at its home region or at its usual destination location .",
    "in this scenario , susceptible individuals can become infected in areas that are geographically apart from their residence area , and infected individuals can travel quite long distances and be able to infect vectors in very distinct areas were they themselves infected . since the disease dynamics is likely to be largely dependent on whether one has a homogeneous or a heterogeneous population , with heterogeneity favoring the establishment of epidemics  cf .",
    "@xcite  this suggests that in areas with significant population movement , the epidemiological dynamics can be strongly influenced by the circulation of human hosts .",
    "the link between host circulation and the disease dynamics seems to be first pointed out by @xcite in slightly different frameworks . in any case , circulation naturally segregates host and vector by their registered and current location , and it is then natural to consider the so - called meta - population models as candidates for modeling the disease dynamics .",
    "such meta - population models can be either of multi - patch or of multi- group type . in some regimes",
    ", the latter can arise as a limit model of the former  eg . in the case of fast sojourn times ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the previous discussion suggests that the use of multi - group models might become a valuable modeling tool for understanding the disease dynamics in urban settings , and indeed there is a growing interest in the literature on these models .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review on such models , and for a discussion on their importance in the epidemiological modeling , and @xcite for a study in a star network .",
    "in addition , see also @xcite for empirical studies on the impact of human movement on the disease dynamics and @xcite for complementary views to @xcite . for",
    "a theoretical review on multi - group models , see @xcite .",
    "the overall interest in these epidemic models have , in turn , raised a natural interest in understanding their qualitative dynamical properties .",
    "this has fostered a considerable literature addressing this problem , and which we now briefly review .      from the point of view of epidemiological mathematical modeling",
    ", the first natural question about any disease - dynamics model is what are its stability features as a function of the basic reproduction number , @xmath0 .",
    "following @xcite , we say than an epidemic model has the _ sharp @xmath0 property _ if the following holds : when @xmath2 , the only feasible equilibrium is the so - called disease free equilibrium ( dfe ) , and it is globally asymptotically stable ( gas ) ; when @xmath1 , there is a single interior equilibrium , the so - called endemic equilibrium ( ee ) , which is then gas .",
    "the literature on mathematical epidemiology and the study of sharp @xmath0 property is long and large , particularly for directly transmitted diseases , but it is considerably smaller for vector - borne diseases . the development of the models for indirectly transmitted diseases can be traced back to ross malaria model as discussed in @xcite  see also the recent review in @xcite and the classical monographs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the bulk of the theory in the literature is leaned towards directly transmitted diseases and uniform populations ",
    "see @xcite for instance . for vector - borne diseases ,",
    "a very natural model is the coupling of a sir model for the humans with a si model .",
    "this model is reasonable for mosquito borne diseases , since they do not have a well developed immunological system , while most of the arboviruses confer lifetime stability .",
    "this model seems to be first suggested in @xcite and it is now known as the bailey - dietz model .",
    "the global dynamics of this model was first studied in @xcite using a lyapunov function argument for the stability of the dfe , while the poincar - bendixson property for 3-d competitive systems is used to show the stability of the ee ; see also @xcite for later similar studies . a global stability analysis using only lyapunov functions",
    "has been obtained only recently@xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for various results on global stability of epidemiological models .    in the framework of multi - group epidemic models for directly transmitted diseases ,",
    "the first paper was probably by rushton and mauser @xcite , but seminal results are in lajmanovich and yorke @xcite and in the book of hethcote and yorke @xcite ; but see also @xcite .",
    "stability results can be found in thieme @xcite ; see also chapter 23 of @xcite .",
    "global stability of multi - group sir model is due to @xcite by using a combinatorial argument arising from graph theory ; see also @xcite for a more extensive presentation of their method . for indirectly transmitted diseases",
    ", the first global stability result seems to be due to @xcite , who observed that a monotone dynamics argument of @xcite was also applicable to a si - si multi - group model .",
    "more recently , general global stability results were obtained by @xcite ; see also @xcite for results on multi - stage models . none of these results , however , cover the case of vector - borne diseases , since vector and host populations might follow different dynamics .",
    "additional references in meta - population models for vector - borne diseases , but without studying the sharp @xmath0 property are @xcite for models with heterogeneous populations and @xcite for a numerical study of a multi - patch model with spatial heterogeneities .    for higher dimensional systems , global stability of endemic equilibrium",
    "is usually done by finding an appropriate lyapunov function@xcite being a notable exception .",
    "the use of lyapunov functions to study the global dynamics of ecological and epidemiological models can be traced at least to the works in the late seventies of goh @xcite , harrison @xcite and hsu @xcite . since then",
    ", it has been successfully used in many studies , and even rediscovered @xcite .",
    "recent applications of lyapunov functions in epidemic and ecological models with meta - populations include @xcite .",
    "see also the recent surveys on the construction and use of lyapunov functions in models of population dynamics by @xcite .",
    "additionally , there is also recent work aiming to obtain similar results for multi - group models , but without recurring to graph theoretic arguments @xcite .",
    "shuai and van den driessche  @xcite discuss two systematic approaches ( graph - theoretic and matrix - theoretic ) to guide the construction of lyapunov functions . for results towards infinite dimensional problems , see @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the sharp @xmath0 property holds for a very natural multi - group extension of the bailey - dietz model  that has been used to model , _",
    "inter alia _ , the dynamics of dengue @xcite .",
    "this extension also accommodates a large number of choices for the modeling of the infection - force , including the most popular ones  see  [ sec : prelims ] for an additional discussion on this issue .",
    "a special case within the class of models discussed here was studied in @xcite which , however , present an incorrect proof of the global stability of the endemic equilibrium . for @xmath3 ,",
    "a careful checking shows that the claimed cancellation properties do not hold . ] . this work can also seen as an extension of the multi - group framework for direct - transmitted diseases in @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : prelims ] we introduce the relevant class of multi - group models and identify the relevant network structure , which is a bipartite graph , that we term the host / vector network",
    ". this bipartite graph can be reducible , even when the group network is strongly connected .",
    "this is markedly different from directly transmitted diseases . on the assumption that the host / vector network is strongly connected , we can meaningfully define an @xmath0 . for the models discussed here , the existence and uniqueness of the endemic equilibrium ( ee ) , when",
    ", @xmath1 is not obvious from the governing equations , and these issues are tackled in section  [ sec : eqstab ] , where the local stability is also established .",
    "we then study the global dynamics in section  [ sec : global ] : when @xmath2 , we show that the disease free equilibrium ( dfe ) is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "we then address the global stability of the ee and , we then show that it is globally asymptotically stable when @xmath1 using a `` vectorial '' extension of the lyapunov function used in @xcite together with an extension of the graph - theoretical approach developed in @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the following , we provide the basic set up for a class of multi - group models for indirectly transmitted diseases . these models are built upon the classical single - patch / group model by @xcite , and include some of the models studied in @xcite and the models studied in @xcite .",
    "we consider the classical bailey - dietz model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote , as usual , the class of susceptible , infections and removed , respectively .",
    "the superscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate that the quantity refers to the host or to the vector .",
    "also , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the total host and vector , respectively , populations .",
    "although they are not necessarily constant , they are taken as so in many applications .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is a composite biological constant that embodies all the biological processes relating to transmission from mosquito to man , from the biting rate of the mosquitoes through the probability to develop and infection after a bite .",
    "analogously @xmath13 captures the effect of transmission from man to mosquito .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is the per capita human mortality , @xmath15 denotes the per capita rates at which infectious individual recover and are permanently immune .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the constant recruitment of mosquitoes and @xmath17 is the per capita vector mortality .",
    "let @xmath18 using the techniques in @xcite , it is straightforward to see that the reproduction number of ( [ 1patch ] ) is    @xmath19    with @xmath20 , the classical vectorial density .",
    "the basic reproduction ratio @xmath21 is the same than for a classical ross s model @xcite .    as for ross s model we will use the prevalences , i.e. , defining @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26",
    "then , two equilibria are possible : the disease free equilibrium @xmath27 and , when @xmath28 , a positive endemic equilibrium @xmath29 .",
    "the global stability of was originally studied by @xcite , who showed that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when @xmath30 , and that the disease - free is the global attractor when @xmath31 .",
    "using the so - called poincar - bendixson theorem for competitive systems  cf .",
    "more recently , @xcite has obtained a proof using only lyapunov functions      we consider that both host and vector populations are divided in @xmath32 groups , where each group @xmath33 has a host population of @xmath34 and a vector population of @xmath35 . at each node @xmath33 , we assume a generalized form of by allowing that the susceptible of group @xmath33 to have contact of mosquitoes of group @xmath36 .",
    "this is specified by an infection term for the host @xmath37 , of the form @xmath38 analogously , we allow susceptible mosquitoes of each group @xmath33 to have contact with infected hosts group @xmath36 , with an infection force for the vectors , @xmath39 , of the form : @xmath40 these assumptions then lead to the following multi - group epidemic model : @xmath41   \\dot i_{h , i}= & s_{h , i } \\ , \\sum_{j=1}^n \\ , l_{i , j}(n_h , n_v)i_{v , j }   - \\gamma_{h , i } \\ , i_{h , i}- \\mu_{h , i } \\ , i_{h , i } \\\\[2 mm ]   \\dot r_{h , i}= & \\gamma_{h , i } \\ ,",

    "these are mild assumptions , and they can accommodate a variety of functional forms for the infections force ",
    "see @xcite for a discussion on the different conclusions implied by different assumptions on the infection force ; see also @xcite for a discussion on the different transmission force related to dengue .",
    "these functions also encode the cross - infection information among all the groups , which will depend on the modeling assumptions that led to the multi - group structure .",
    "similar models have been considered in the literature .",
    "see @xcite for a multi - group sis - si model and @xcite for a multi - group seir - sei model , obtained as the fast sojourn limit of a more general model .",
    "while model can be easily modified to include disease induced death , the analysis carried out in the sequel can not be extended to such models , except in the case of constant population . however , for diseases as dengue or chikungunya , this is not a very restricting assumption , as their morbidity is , generally , not high .",
    "dengue can be an exception to that , if there are two epidemics in a row with an intermediate time spacing . in this case ,",
    "enhanced immunological reaction can cause the so - called severe dengue fever , previously known as haemorraghic dengue , which can be highly fatal if not treated appropriately @xcite .",

    "also , let @xmath50 then , it is clear that , for , the set @xmath51 is a compact absorbing and positively invariant set .",
    "also , notice that the system is of triangular form , and hence its stability analysis can be considerably simplified .",
    "there are a number of results that allow for such a simplification in the study of global stability of systems of this kind@xcite . for the convenience of the reader , we recall the following result :    [ vid : theo ] :    consider the following @xmath52 system : @xmath53    if @xmath54 is globally asymptotically stable ( gas ) in @xmath55for the system @xmath56 , and if @xmath57 is gas in @xmath58 , for the system @xmath59 , then @xmath60 is ( locally ) asymptotically stable for ( [ triang ] )",
    ". moreover , if all the trajectories of ( [ triang ] ) are forward bounded , then @xmath60 is gas for ( [ triang ] ) .",
    "since @xmath61 is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium for the first two equations of , we can use theorem  [ vid : theo ] to reduce the study of the stability properties of to the study of the stability of @xmath62 in what follows , we shall denote by @xmath63 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the vectors of @xmath64 whose components are respectively @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . we shall also write @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "system   can then be written in the following vectorial notation : @xmath70 where for @xmath71 , @xmath72 denotes the @xmath73 diagonal matrix whose main diagonal is @xmath74 .",
    "we shall need an assumption about the network topology in system  . for a matrix @xmath75",
    ", we write @xmath76 for the associated graph . we begin with a definition    [ def : hvcn ] given nonnegative matrices @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we write @xmath79 the graph associated to @xmath80 , @xmath81 , is denoted the host - vector contact network , or contact network for short .",
    "[ hyp:1 ] the contact network is strongly connected , i.e. , @xmath80 is nonnegative and irreducible .",
    "notice that irreducibility of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are neither necessary nor sufficient for the irreducibility of @xmath80 . as an example , consider @xmath82 then @xmath83 is irreducible and @xmath84 is reducible .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath85 is reducible and @xmath86 is irreducible .",
    "the irreducibility of @xmath80 is associated to the strong connectivity of the corresponding directed bipartite graph .",
    "this is a consequence of the infection process , when considered between hosts ( or vectors ) themselves , is a two step process .",
    "thus , even when the circulation structure ( the non - zero patterns of @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) is strongly connected , this is not necessarily the case for the host - vector contact structure of an indirectly transmitted disease , and this is a significant difference to directly transmitted ones .    in the following proposition",
    "we shall give a useful characterization of the irreducibility of @xmath87 that will be used later on :    [ prop : factors_irred ] @xmath87 is irreducible if , and only if , the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .   both @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "are irreducible ; 2 .",
    "we have that @xmath90 , for some @xmath91 ( and hence , for every @xmath91 ) .",

    "thus @xmath77 applied to a column of @xmath98 positive . the argument for @xmath78 is similar .",
    "conversely , if both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are irreducible , then we have that the main diagonals of @xmath99 are positive .",
    "the remaining blocks are also positive , since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are acting on positive matrices .",
    "finally , let @xmath100 be a positive eigenvector associated to @xmath101 .",

    "the argument for left eigenvectors is analogous .",
    "we observe that system   can be recast as a special case of the multigroup sir model treated in  @xcite , as follows : replace @xmath108 by @xmath109 in the last equation of  . include the redundant equation : @xmath110 let @xmath111 , @xmath112 and set @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , for @xmath47 .",

    "moreover , @xmath142 has a positive fixed point iff @xmath143 . if there is a fixed point , then it is unique .",
    "we have to check , for our function @xmath144 defined on @xmath145 , the conditions of theorem  [ thm : thieme ] .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath144 is continuous , bounded and maps the nonnegative orthant @xmath146 into itself .",
