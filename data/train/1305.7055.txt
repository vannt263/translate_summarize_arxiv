    "it is more and more likely that the 125gev particle discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite is the standard model ( sm ) higgs .",
    "its couplings to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons , to the top and bottom quarks , and to the tau lepton are all consistent to those in the sm within one standard deviation even though their values vary two orders of magnitude , see e.g.  ref .  @xcite .",
    "no hint of new physics beyond the sm has been found so far at the lhc up to 1tev .",
    "it is important to examine to what scale the sm can be a valid effective description of nature .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , froggatt and nielsen have predicted the top and higgs masses to be @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , based on the assumption that the sm higgs potential must have another minimum at the planck scale and that its height is order - of - magnitude - wise degenerate to the sm one .",
    "( this assumption is equivalent to the vanishing higgs quartic coupling and its beta function at the planck scale . )",
    "the success of this prediction indicates that at least the top - higgs sector of the sm is not much altered up to a very high ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff scale .",
    "as all the parameters in the sm are fixed by the higgs mass determination , we can now obtain the _ bare _ parameters at the uv cutoff scale , which then become important inputs for a given uv completion of the sm .",
    "if the uv theory fails to fit them , it is killed .",
    "the parameters in the sm are dimensionless except for the higgs mass ( or equivalently its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) ) .",
    "the dimensionless bare coupling constants can be approximated by the running ones at the uv cutoff scale , see e.g.  appendix of ref .",
    "the latter can be evaluated through the standard renormalization group equations ( rges ) once the low energy inputs are given .",
    "after fixing all the dimensionless bare couplings , the last remaining one is the bare higgs mass which is the main subject of this work .",
    "the largest ambiguity for the higgs mass parameter is coming from the low energy input of the top yukawa coupling at the top mass scale .",
    "let us review the present status of its determination .",
    "important point is the distinction between the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath0 ) mass and the pole one , which are utilized , respectively , in the @xmath0 and on - shell schemes .",
    "currently the most accurate value of the top quark mass is obtained from combination of the tevatron data , basically reconstructed as an invariant mass of its decay products  @xcite : @xmath5 whereas the similar analysis of the lhc data gives  @xcite : @xmath6 .",
    "( if we naively combine these two results , we get @xmath7 , which is of 0.4% accuracy . )",
    "however , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite criticize that the top quark mass , measured at the tevatron and lhc via kinematical reconstruction from the top quark decay products and comparison to monte carlo simulations , is not necessarily the pole mass @xmath8 but is merely the mass parameter in the monte carlo program which does not resort to any given renormalization scheme .",
    "the point is that the mass of the colored top quark is reconstructed from the color singlet final states .. ] to circumvent this problem , they propose to determine the @xmath0 top quark mass directly from the dependence of the inclusive @xmath9 cross section on it . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed values at tevatron : @xmath10 are combined and fit by the theoretical prediction , which is obtained by using four different parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at the nnlo and by including the nnlo qcd contributions to @xmath11 . the resultant value of the @xmath0 running top mass at the top mass scale becomes  @xcite : @xmath12 in the above computation , the nlo electroweak ( ew ) radiative corrections ( @xmath13 ) to @xmath11 are neglected .",
    "the ratio of the sum of such ew corrections to the @xmath9 total cross section at the tevatron in the on - shell scheme is shown to be less than 0.2% for the higgs mass 120200gev and the top pole mass 165180gev  @xcite .",
    "theoretically the @xmath0 mass in eq .",
    "is related to the pole mass @xmath8 by @xmath14 where up to the nnlo qcd corrections of @xmath15 , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the strong coupling in the six flavor @xmath0 scheme .",
    "this relation result in the pole mass  @xcite @xmath18 in ref .",
    "@xcite the pole mass of the top quark @xmath8 is also directly extracted from the nnlo theory prediction using the on - shell scheme .",
    "the resultant central value varies @xmath19@xmath20gev , depending on the pdf , with the error less than 2.4gev for each .",
    "these values are consistent to eq .  .",
    "to summarize , the derived pole mass is close to the experimentally obtained invariant mass  .",
    "it is customary to define the @xmath0 running vev @xmath21 in such a way that @xmath22 holds for the potential @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "then the @xmath0 top mass is commonly defined as , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath25 this definition of the @xmath0 mass leads to  @xcite @xmath26 where , taking into account up to nlo ew contributions of @xmath27 , @xmath28 this discrepancy   is due to the definition of the @xmath0 top mass via eq .  , and is dominantly coming from the tadpole contribution to the shift of @xmath21 .",
    "if we instead use the definition of the @xmath0 mass @xmath29 with @xmath30gev , where @xmath31 is the fermi constant determined from the muon life time , then we would get the one given in eq .  .",

    "let us review the derivation of @xmath34 more in detail .",

    ", we obtain @xmath51 , and hence the running mass  .",
    "in this proceedings we show our result  @xcite based on eq .   with the pole mass  .",
    "in figure  [ smcouplings ] , we show a plot with the two loop rges , summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the dimensionless sm couplings , with the low energy boundary condition for the top yukawa as explained above , namely with @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is the beta function for the higgs quartic coupling : @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is explained in the following .    , except for @xmath56 which is _ not _ a running mass but is the ( quadratically divergent part of ) bare higgs mass parameter , obtained by taking each scale on the horizontal axis to be the cutoff @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the one loop integral . ]    in the bare perturbation theory , the renormalized higgs mass squared parameter is given at the one loop level by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the quadratically divergent one loop integral over the euclidean momentum . in obtaining the expression  ,",
    "we assume existence of an underlying gauge invariant regularization , such as string theory , and freely shift the integrated momenta .",
    "the requirement that the sum in the parentheses in eq .   to be zero is the celebrated veltman condition . in a mass independent renormalization scheme , including the dimensional regularization , the bare mass squared @xmath56 is chosen in such a way that the renormalized mass parameter becomes zero , @xmath61 , when @xmath62 ; and then non - zero @xmath63 is introduced as a perturbation .",
    "( this choice of the bare mass @xmath56 to cancel the quadratic divergence is automatic in the dimensional regularization scheme . )",
    "consequently the bare mass @xmath56 contains a quadratic divergence : @xmath64 , whereas the running mass @xmath63 only logarithmic one : @xmath65 .",
    "note that this cancellation of @xmath64 by @xmath56 is done once and for all , and then we never see @xmath64 .",
    "bardeen has argued that therefore the quadratic divergence is not a real problem , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "however , e.g.  in obtaining a low energy effective field theory from string theory , this procedure of matching @xmath64 by @xmath56 is not a fake , and we focus on this largest part @xmath56 in the bare lagrangian , neglecting the subleasing @xmath66 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have obtained the bare higgs mass at two loop orders in the bare perturbation theory : @xmath67 which realizes @xmath61 for @xmath62 at this order , where @xmath68 is the quadratically divergent two loop integral over the euclidean momenta . as a non - trivial check of the consistency of our treatment ,",
    "we have confirmed that the coefficients of the infrared divergent integral @xmath69 cancel out in each gauge invariant set of diagrams .",
    "we note that our two loop computation is for the quadratically divergent part @xmath56 and is irrelevant to the higher loop result @xmath70 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which would correspond to the effects of the rge running of the dimensionless couplings in our language .",
    "in obtaining the two - loop corrected bare mass @xmath71 , one needs a relation between the one- and two - loop integrals @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which is necessarily regularization scheme dependent .",
    "when we employ @xmath74 we get @xmath75 with the blue solid line in fig .  , we plot @xmath55 when the uv cutoff is at the planck scale , that is , when @xmath76 .",
    "the blue dashed line is the same with the 1-loop only bare mass @xmath77 .",
    "we see that the two - loop correction is small , so is the regularization dependence . for comparison , we also plot the quartic coupling @xmath78 at the planck scale with the red dotted line .",
    "we see that both become small for @xmath79gev .",
    "( @xmath80 ) in units of @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "for comparison , we also plot the quartic coupling @xmath78 at the planck scale with the red dotted line . ]",
    "we have computed two loop correction to the quadratically divergent part of the bare sm higgs mass in the bare perturbation theory .",
    "we have found that in generic regularizations the two loop correction to the bare mass is small .",
    "therefore the regularization dependence is not large .",
    "both the resultant bare higgs mass and quartic coupling can become small if the top quark pole mass is around 170gev .",
    "possible consequences of this result will be presented elsewhere .",
