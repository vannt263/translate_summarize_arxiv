    "theoretical study on shapes of closed lipid membranes made great progress two decades ago .",
    "the shape equation of closed membranes was obtained in 1987 @xcite , with which the biconcave discoidal shape of the red cell was naturally explained @xcite , and a ratio of @xmath0 of the two radii of a torus vesicle membrane was predicted @xcite and confirmed by experiment @xcite .    during the formation process of the cell , either material will be added to the edge or the edge will heal itself so as to form closed structure .",
    "there are also metastable cup - like equilibrium shapes of lipid membranes with free edges @xcite .",
    "recently , opening - up process of liposomal membranes by talin @xcite has also been observed gives rise to the interest of studying the equilibrium equation and boundary conditions of lipid membranes with free exposed edges .",
    "first study this problem and give the equilibrium equation and boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "they also discuss the mechanical meaning of these equations @xcite .",
    "the study of these cup - like structures enables us to understand the assembly process of vesicles .",
    "_ suggest that a line tension can be associated with a domain boundary between two different phases of an inhomogeneous vesicle and leads to the budding @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , however , we will restrict our discussion on open homogenous vesicles .    in this paper , a lipid membrane with freely exposed edge",
    "is regarded as a differentiable surface with a boundary curve .",
    "exterior differential forms are introduced to describe the surface and the curve .",
    "the total free energy is defined as the sum of helfrich s free energy and the surface and line tension energy . the equilibrium equation and the boundary conditions of the membrane",
    "are derived from the variation of the total free energy .",
    "these equations can also be applied to the membrane with several freely exposed edges .",
    "this is another way to obtain the results of capovilla _ et al .",
    "_ some solutions to the equations are obtained and the corresponding shapes are shown .",
    "they can be used to explain some known experimental results @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[extdf ] , we retrospect briefly the surface theory expressed by exterior differential forms . in sec.[hodge ] , we introduce some basic properties of hodge star @xmath1 . in sec.[variation ] , we construct the variational theory of the surface and give some useful formulas . in sec.[functional ] , we derive the equilibrium equation and boundary conditions of the membrane from the variation of the total free energy . in sec.[shape ] , we suggest some special solutions to the equations and show their corresponding shapes . in sec.[numeric ] , we put forward a numerical scheme to give some axisymmetric solutions as well as their corresponding shapes to explain some experimental results . in sec.[conclusion ] , we give a brief conclusion and prospect the challenging work .",
