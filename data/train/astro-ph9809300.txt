    "[ sec : intro ] the origin of some , and possibly all , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) at cosmological distances has been firmly established with the identification of x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the subsequent measurement of cosmological redshifts for at least four of the optical afterglows and/or their host galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the objects responsible for producing the majority of grbs , the gamma - ray bursters themselves , have yet to be understood , however . to obtain an understanding of the spatial distribution of sources and the distribution of their burst luminosities is a crucial step towards identifying the physical processes that produce grbs .    before the rapid follow - up of grb afterglows was made possible by the _ bepposax _ satellite , the only way to test hypotheses about the spatial and luminosity distributions was to fit parametric models to the measured characteristics of the bursts themselves . for this purpose",
    "the distribution of grb intensities was used ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the effects of cosmological time dilation on the time profiles of bright versus faint bursts were also studied ( @xcite ) . since",
    "optical spectroscopic redshifts are so far associated with only four ( possibly five ) bursts , number counts as a function of intensity remain an important tool for exploring the possible spatial and luminosity distributions of grbs .",
    "several recent papers ( totani 1997 , 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have used the observed grb intensity distributions to investigate the possibility that the redshift distribution of gamma - ray bursters traces the global star formation history of the universe . the motivation for this hypothesis is a collection of theoretical models in which grbs are produced by stellar objects that evolve from their formation to their bursting phase on a time scale of @xmath3 myr or less .",
    "this group of models includes the merging of a neutron star with another neutron star or a black hole , the collapse of a massive star , and the collapse of a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf ( see @xcite for references ) . in these scenarios ,",
    "the cosmological redshift distribution of the grb rate should approximately follow the redshift distribution of the formation rate of stellar objects ; in other words , the grb rate should trace the global star formation history of the universe .",
    "this hypothesis appears to solve some puzzling aspects of the observations , such as the `` no host '' problem ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of redshift has been studied by lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , fall , charlot , & pei ( 1996 ) , madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 ) , and hughes et al .",
    "the principal result of these studies is that the sfr was substantially higher in the past . between the present and @xmath4",
    "the sfr increases by a factor of @xmath5 ; it peaks somewhere in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; and it decreases to a rate comparable to the present by @xmath8 45 ( this last point remains uncertain ) .",
    "totani ( 1997 ) , wijers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , krumholz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and mao & mo ( 1998 ) all find that the grb peak flux number counts can accommodate the hypothesis that the grb rate follows the sfr . among the important conclusions that these authors derive from this interpretation of the data",
    "are the following : 1 ) that the faintest gamma - ray bursts observed with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ )",
    "are already produced at redshifts of @xmath7 to @xmath9 ( @xcite ; but see section  [ sec : discuss ] ) ; and 2 ) that more sensitive experiments are unlikely to discover large numbers of faint grbs ( of the `` classical '' kind that are detected with current instruments ) below the batse onboard detection threshold .",
    "the latter conclusion has important implications for the design and operation of future grb detectors , which will test the behavior of grb number counts at intensities well below the batse threshold .",
    "we have recently completed a search of 6 years of archival data from batse for grbs and other transients that did _ not _ activate the real - time burst detection system ( or `` trigger '' ) running onboard the spacecraft .",
    "a grb or other transient may fail to activate the batse onboard burst trigger for any of several reasons",
    ". the burst may be too faint to exceed the onboard detection threshold , it may occur while the onboard trigger is disabled for technical reasons , it may occur while the onboard trigger is optimized for detecting non - grb phenomena , or it may artificially raise the onboard background estimate and be mistaken for a below - threshold event .",
    "our search of the archival data is sensitive to grbs with peak fluxes ( measured over 1.024 s in the 50300 kev energy range ) that are a factor of @xmath0 lower than can be detected with the onboard trigger in its nominal configuration .",
    "thus our search constitutes an experiment that is @xmath0 times more sensitive than those reported in the batse catalogs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper we present results regarding the peak flux distribution of the grbs detected with our `` off - line '' search of archival data . in section [ sec : search ] we summarize some important aspects of our off - line search and we discuss the  statistic for the bursts we detected .",
    "we show that surprisingly few bursts are found on the 4.096 s and 8.192 s time scales that were not already detected on the 1.024 s time scale . in section [ sec : cosmo ] we fit parametric cosmological models to the observed differential peak flux distribution to compare scenarios in which the grb rate follows the sfr with the model in which the co - moving grb rate is independent of redshift .",
    "we also examine the possibility that a homogeneous ( in euclidean space ) population of bursting objects could be contributing to the observed sample of grbs . in section [ sec : discuss ] we show how our results provide two independent arguments that favor models in which the grb rate follows the sfr over models in which the grb rate is independent of redshift .",
    "the details of our off - line search of the batse data are discussed in kommers et al .",
    "we have merely extended the search from covering 345 days of the mission to covering 2200 days .",
    "we have also made minor modifications to our peak flux estimation procedure in order to secure better relative calibration between our peak fluxes and those in the 4b catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "the extended catalog of non - triggered events will be provided and discussed in the non - triggered supplement to the batse gamma - ray burst catalogs ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we address only those aspects of the search that are relevant to the grb intensity distribution analysis .",
    "we use the data from the large area detectors that provide count rates in 4 energy channels with 1.024 s time resolution ( the data type designated `` discla '' in the flight software ; @xcite ) .",
    "these data are searched for statistically significant count rate increases to identify candidate burst events .",
    "the many candidate events ( `` off - line triggers '' ) are then visually inspected to separate astronomically interesting transients from instrumental and terrestrial effects . to be considered a grb ,",
    "a candidate must exhibit significant signal in the 50300 kev range ( discla channels 2 and 3 ) and it must _ lack _ any characteristics that would associate it with a solar flare , earth magnetospheric particle precipitation , or other non - grb origin . since the discla data are ( nearly ) continuously recorded , our search detects some bursts that already activated the onboard burst trigger ; we call these events `` onboard - triggered bursts .",
    "'' bursts that were detected _ exclusively _ by our search of archival data are called `` non - triggered bursts . ''",
    "in addition to searching at the 1.024 s time resolution of the discla files , we also search the data binned at 4.096 s and 8.192 s time resolution .",
    "the longer time bins provide greater sensitivity to faint bursts that have durations longer than @xmath10 s or @xmath11 s. the specific time profile of each burst determines which of these three time scales is the most sensitive . for this reason the searches on each time scale should be considered separate experiments .",
    "our search covers @xmath12 s of archival data spanning the time from 1991 december 9 to 1997 december 16 . in these data we detected 2265 grbs ,",
    "of which 1392 activated the onboard burst trigger and 873 did not .",
    "we will refer to these 2265 grbs as the `` off - line grb sample . '' during the same time period , the onboard burst trigger detected 1815 grbs .",
    "the @xmath13 bursts that were detected by the onboard burst trigger but that were _ not _ detected by our search either occurred during gaps in the archival discla data or had durations much less than the 1.024 s time resolution ( so they did not achieve adequate statistical significance in the archival data ) .    _ note that because the best time resolution available to our retrospective search is 1.024 s , all results in this paper pertain to bursts with durations longer than about 1 s_. thus , the population of `` short '' ( duration less than @xmath0 s ) bursts that contributes to the bi - modal grb duration distribution ( @xcite ) is not well represented in the off - line sample .",
    "an estimate for the fraction of bursts that our search is likely to miss because of our time resolution can be obtained from the 4b catalog .",
    "although 21% of grbs for which both durations and fluences were available had @xmath14 s , only 7% had both @xmath15 s and fluences too small to create adequate statistical significance in the 1.024 s data ( @xcite ) .    for each of the 873 non - triggered grbs",
    "we have estimated a peak flux in the 50300 kev range based on the time bin with the most counts above background . for 1288 of the 1392 onboard - triggered grbs",
    ", we used the peak fluxes from the current batse grb catalog ( @xcite ) . for the remaining 104 onboard - triggered bursts ,",
    "peak fluxes were not available from the current burst catalog ; we estimated peak fluxes for them using our own techniques as we did for the non - triggered bursts .",
    "since the onboard trigger criteria were changed for a variety of reasons during the time spanned by our search , we adopt for the nominal onboard detection threshold the value 0.3 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 in the 50300 kev range . at this peak flux",
    "the onboard trigger efficiency is @xmath18 ( @xcite ) . with this estimate ,",
    "551 of our 873 non - triggered bursts were below the nominal onboard detection threshold .",
    "the rest were not detected onboard for the reasons cited previously .      to determine the peak flux threshold of the off - line grb sample ,",
    "the trigger efficiency @xmath19 of our off - line search has been calculated using the techniques described in kommers et al .",
    "this quantity is the probability that a burst that occupies exactly one 1.024 s time bin with a peak flux @xmath20 will be detected by the off - line search algorithm .",
    "@xmath19 is well represented ( within the uncertainties of the calculation owing to variations in the background rates ) by the following function : @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the standard error function and @xmath20 is given in units of photons @xmath16 s@xmath17 in the 50 - 300 kev band .",
    "this equation is plotted as the dashed line in figure  [ fig : nteff ] .",
    "error bars on the grid points of the calculation ( diamonds ) represent the sample standard deviation of the calculated probabilities owing to variations in the background rates . for comparison ,",
    "the batse trigger efficiency from the 4b catalog ( @xcite ) is plotted as the dotted line ( grid points are indicated by open squares ) .",
    "equation [ eqn : oneteff ] tends to _ underestimate _ the probability that a typical grb will be detected , however .",
    "this is because many grbs in our sample last longer than 1.024 s ; therefore , these bursts have more than one statistical chance to be included in the sample .",
    "suppose the peak of a burst occupies @xmath23 time bins , so that the burst has effectively @xmath23 statistical chances to be detected .",
    "then the probability that the burst is detected can be approximated as unity minus the probability that the burst _ fails _ to be detected in all @xmath23 trials : @xmath24^{n}.\\ ] ] since the number of chances @xmath23 is not known for grbs _ a priori _ , the actual probability of detection @xmath25 is obtained by marginalizing @xmath26 over the distribution of @xmath23 for bursts with peak fluxes near @xmath20 : @xmath27 our estimate for @xmath28 , the histogram of the various integer values of @xmath23 for bursts with peak fluxes near @xmath20 , was obtained from the detected sample of bursts by counting , for each burst , the number of time bins with count rates that were within one standard deviation of the peak count rate . for purposes of illustration ,",
    "figure  [ fig : nhist ] shows the histogram of @xmath23 for bursts with peak fluxes in the range 0.10.4 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",
    "the resulting function @xmath25 is well represented ( to within the uncertainties of the calculation ) by the formula @xmath29.\\ ] ] this equation expresses our best estimate of the trigger efficiency of our off - line search on the 1.024 s time scale .",
    "it is plotted as the solid line in figure  [ fig : nteff ] .",
    "the efficiency of our search falls below 0.5 at a peak flux of 0.16 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",
    "if we had not made some correction for the effect of time profiles on the single - time - bin burst detection probabilities , we would have substantially underestimated our trigger efficiency near the detection threshold ( @xmath30 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 ) .",
    "we note that this type of correction to the single - time - bin trigger efficiency should also be applied when using the trigger efficiencies given in the 1b , 2b , 3b , and 4b catalogs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similar considerations are addressed by int zand & fenimore ( 1994 ) and loredo & wasserman ( 1995 ) .",
    "as successively more sensitive instruments have been used to produce grb catalogs , it has been customary to give the value of the   statistic for the detected bursts ( @xcite ) . for photon counting experiments like batse , it is not strictly  that is typically calculated , but rather @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the threshold count rate and @xmath34 is the maximum count rate measured during the burst .",
    "the departure of @xmath35 from the value of @xmath36 expected for a population of bursters distributed homogeneously in euclidean space ( with a well - behaved , but otherwise arbitrary luminosity distribution ) has been firmly established ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since the discovery that most grbs originate at cosmological distances , the quantity @xmath37 can no longer be interpreted as . nevertheless , it is useful to compare the values of @xmath37 obtained by successively more sensitive experiments , including the value obtained for the bursts detected with our search .",
    "table  [ tbl : vvmax ] lists various missions and the values they obtained for @xmath35 .",
    "the trend towards lower values of @xmath35 with more sensitive experiments indicates that increasing the accessible survey volume by decreasing the flux threshold does not lead to the detection of large numbers of faint bursts .",
    "the value of @xmath35 for the 2265 grbs detected by our search is @xmath2 .",
    "_ this is the lowest value ever obtained for a sample of grbs_. the cumulative distribution of @xmath31 for our grbs is shown in figure  [ fig : vvmax ] .",
    "the flattening of this curve in the range @xmath38 shows that over 90% of the grbs we detect are above threshold ( on at least one of the 3 time scales ) by a factor of at least @xmath39 .",
    "the reason for this low value of @xmath32 is the fact that most of the bursts we detected had their maximum signal - to - noise ratios on the 4.096 s and 8.192 s time scales , yet surprisingly few bursts were detected _ only _ on these longer time scales . for each burst",
    "we compute the values of @xmath31 on each of the 3 time scales .",
    "the largest of the three values for each burst is used in taking the average . in euclidean space",
    "this corresponds to taking for each burst the _",
    "smallest _ value of . since 72.0% of the bursts we detected",
    "have @xmath40 durations ( @xcite ) longer than 8 s , we expect the average @xmath35 to be dominated by values measured on the 8.192 s time scale .",
    "in fact , the average @xmath41 includes 520 values measured on the 1.024 s time scale , 491 values measured on the 4.096 s time scale , and 1254 values measured on the 8.192 s time scale .",
    "yet only 105 bursts were detected _",
    "exclusively _ on either of the 4.096 or 8.192 s time scales ( or both ) .",
    "many of the bursts that are barely above the detection threshold on the 1.024 s time scale are well above the detection threshold on the longer time scales .",
    "thus very few bursts are found to be just barely above our detection threshold on all 3 time scales , and this accounts for the low value of @xmath37 . restricting our calculation to use _ only _ count rates measured on the 1.024 s time scale ( and bursts detected on the 1.024 s time scale ) gives a larger value , @xmath42 .",
    "roughly , the 4.096 s search should be @xmath0 times more sensitive than the 1.024 s search for bursts that maintain their peak flux for at least @xmath10 s , and the 8.192 s search should be yet more sensitive .",
    "therefore our lack of grb detections exclusively on the longer time scales indicates either 1 ) a substantial paucity of faint , long bursts below the threshold of our 1.024 s search , or 2 ) that during our visual inspection of the off - line triggers we have tended to classify a substantial number of faint , long grbs as other ( non - grb ) phenomena .",
    "we feel that both alternatives must be present at some level .",
    "a review of the non - grb off - line triggers suggests that events resembling faint , long grbs that illuminate the same detectors as a known , bright , variable x - ray source are more likely to be attributed to variability from the x - ray source than to be classified as grbs .",
    "there is also a tendency to classify bursts that have directions consistent with the sun as solar flares .",
    "a secondary evaluation of the event classifications suggests that between 50 and 200 ( this range represents the central 90% confidence interval ) , with a most likely value of 86 , grbs have been misclassified in this way .",
    "the corresponding `` loss rate '' is between 2% and 8% ( most likely 4% ) of the total 2265 bursts in the off - line sample .",
    "this is not enough to fully explain , as experimental error , the dearth of faint , long bursts below our 1.024 s threshold .",
    "detailed comparisons of cosmological models with the data require intensity distributions in physical units .",
    "we have chosen to do the analysis in terms of the burst rate as a function of peak photon flux measured over 1.024 s in the energy range 50300 kev .",
    "compared with the fluence ( total energy per unit area deposited in the detector by the burst ) we prefer peak photon flux for the purposes of intensity analysis .",
    "the peak photon flux can be obtained more reliably from the raw count data and it is more directly related to our ability to detect bursts .    of the 2265 grbs detected by our search ,",
    "we chose to include in our peak flux analysis only those that were detected on the 1.024 s time scale , so that equation [ eqn : nteff ] gives the detection efficiency .",
    "we also chose to use only those bursts with peak fluxes in the range 0.1820.0 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",
    "the lower limit ensures that the off - line trigger efficiency exceeds 0.8 for the range of intensities used in the analysis , and the upper limit excludes very bright bursts which are too rare to provide adequate counting statistics in narrow peak flux bins . with these cuts on the data ,",
    "we are left with 1998 peak flux measurements . to fit the differential intensity distribution , we bin the 1998 bursts into 25 peak flux intervals that were chosen to be approximately evenly spaced in the logarithm of @xmath20 .",
    "the spacing is @xmath43 in the range @xmath44 , @xmath45 in the range @xmath46 , and there is a final broad bin for the range @xmath47 .",
    "uncertainties in the number of bursts @xmath48 in each bin are taken to be @xmath49 .",
    "the burst rate is computed by dividing the number of bursts in each bin by the live time of the search ( @xmath12 s = 4.21 yr ) and the mean solid angle visible to the batse detectors ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : pfdata ] gives the peak flux intervals , number of bursts , and burst rate for each bin .",
    "many investigators , in scores of papers , have shown the consistency of the grb peak flux distribution with various cosmological models ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the off - line grb sample extends the observed grb intensity distribution to peak fluxes that are lower by a factor of @xmath0 than could be studied previously .",
    "while it is unlikely that a factor of @xmath0 will yield stringent new model constraints , it remains of interest to note a few cosmological models that provide good fits to the extended grb peak flux distribution .",
    "these can be used to set limits on the rate of grbs that may come from a nearby , spatially homogeneous subpopulation of burst sources .      to limit the number of free parameters that must be considered",
    ", our choice of cosmological world model is the einstein - de sitter model ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this cosmology has been used by many other investigators so it allows easy comparison of results . where needed , we assume a hubble constant @xmath54 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "we also assume that bursters are distributed isotropically , so the only interesting parameter in the burster spatial ( redshift ) distribution is the radial coordinate @xmath55 from earth .",
    "the following derivation of the expected peak flux distributions follows the discussions in fenimore & bloom ( 1995 ) and loredo & wasserman ( 1997 ) .",
    "in general the rate of bursts @xmath56 per unit interval in peak flux @xmath20 observable at earth is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the equivalent isotropic peak luminosity of the burst at the source , @xmath59 is the redshift parameter , @xmath60 is the rate of bursts per unit @xmath58 per unit redshift interval , @xmath61 is the dirac delta function , and @xmath62 is the peak photon flux measured at earth for a burst with peak luminosity @xmath58 located at redshift @xmath59",
    ". we will assume that the redshift and luminosity distributions are independent , so that the burst rate as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath59 is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an overall normalization , @xmath65 is the distribution of burst luminosities ( normalized to unity ) , @xmath66 is the distribution of the co - moving burst rate as a function of redshift ( normalized to unity on the interval @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 is the co - moving radial coordinate .",
    "the peak flux @xmath62 observed at earth in the 50300 kev energy range , where the batse burst trigger is sensitive , depends on the intrinsic spectrum of the grb .",
    "we write it as @xmath69 the spectral correction function @xmath70 depends on the shape of the burst photon energy spectrum at the source .",
    "the observed grbs have a variety of spectral shapes , and in the cosmological scenario these observed spectra have been redshifted according to the ( unknown ) redshifts of the sources .    to account for the spectral variety of grbs we use the spectral fits of band et al .",

    "( 1993 ) has exactly the mean intrinsic peak luminosity in the cosmological model being considered : @xmath72 , where the shape of @xmath65 depends on the parameters of the model luminosity function .",
    "we then solve for the redshift @xmath73 which the fitted burst @xmath71 must have had to produce the peak flux listed for it in the current batse grb catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "fifty - one of the bursts fitted by band et al .",

    "spectra increases the computational cost of the rate model by a factor of @xmath83 over using a single `` universal '' burst spectrum .",
    "we found that a simple power - law form for the grb photon energy spectrum  as has been used by many previous studies  predicts significantly different burst rates at low peak fluxes than does equation [ eqn : rate ] .",
    "since we are interested in the behavior of the burst rate at low peak fluxes , we felt that the analysis based on the full 51 band et al .",
    "spectra would be more reliable .",
    "similar conclusions are reached by fenimore & bloom ( 1995 ) and mallozzi , pendleton , & paciesas ( 1996 ) .",
    "for comparison with the results of previous studies , we chose two forms for the luminosity distribution .",

    "are given in table [ tbl : rlums ] .",
    "to calculate each of these peak luminosities , we have used the observed 50300 kev peak flux ( on the 1.024 s time scale ) in combination with the observed redshift to find the expectation value of the intrinsic luminosity averaged over the 51 band et al .",
    "this procedure is the one used in our modeling , so it was used on these four bursts also , to facilitate comparisons with the models ( see section [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "the peak luminosities estimated here are somewhat higher by factors of @xmath89 to @xmath90 than those reported elsewhere ( e.g. , krumholz et al .",
    "this is because the spectral shapes fitted by band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) generally become steeper at high energies , so a source at high redshift must be more luminous to produce the flux observed at earth than it would have to be if the spectrum did not fall off so rapidly at higher energies .",
    "these differences illustrate the importance of using the most realistic spectral models available rather than simple power - laws when analyzing the grb intensity distribution .",
    "a variety of spatial , or rather redshift , distributions for the bursters have been used in previous studies of the grb intensity distribution . with up to 4 free parameters already incorporated into our burst rate models ( the overall normalization @xmath64 , and the parameters of the power - law luminosity function @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 )",
    "there is little hope of constraining any additional free parameters in the redshift distribution .",
    "here we explore 3 specific models of the redshift distribution that contain no free parameters .",
    "the two physical scenarios we examine are 1 ) that the co - moving burst rate is independent of redshift between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and 2 ) that the co - moving grb rate is proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) .    for the grb rate model that is independent of redshift , @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "we refer to this redshift distribution as `` model d1 . ''    for the case where the burst rate follows the star formation history of the universe , we use two slightly different parameterizations of the sfr .",

    "this conclusion follows for any well - behaved distribution of intrinsic luminosities as long the spatial distribution does not deviate from homogeneity within the volume sampled by our detectors . since the observed intensity distribution of all grbs deviates strongly from the @xmath135 power - law , it can be used to set an upper limit on the fraction of all grbs that can come from a subclass which obeys the @xmath135 power - law . in this respect ,",
    "the faint end of the peak flux distribution ( as explored by our off - line search ) provides the most stringent constraints",
    ".    a model - independent limit on the fraction of bursts that might come from a nearby homogeneous population can be obtained from the histogram of @xmath31 for the observed bursts .",
    "any homogeneous subpopulation is expected to contribute a constant number of bursts to each bin in the histogram .",
    "thus the bin with the fewest number of bursts sets an upper limit on the total number of bursts that could come from the subpopulation .",
    "the bursts detected with our search have already been used to set an upper limit of 56% on the fraction of bursts that could come from a homogeneous subpopulation ; this limit is therefore an upper limit on the fraction of bursts that could be associated with nearby type ib / c sne ( @xcite ) .",
    "though model - independent , this limit depends on how coarsely the histogram is binned .",
    "it also assumes than an arbitrary distribution of intensities is acceptable for bursts that do _ not _ come from the homogeneous subpopulation .",
    "this is too much freedom , because physically plausible distributions occupy only a subset of all arbitrary intensity distributions .",
    "here we assume that the bulk of grbs come from the cosmological distributions discussed in section [ subsec : purecos ] .",
    "an upper limit on the rate of all grbs that might come from type ib / c sne ( or any nearby homogeneous distribution ) is then fixed by determining the maximum rate of bursts that can come from a ( differential ) distribution proportional to @xmath136 before the model becomes inconsistent with the data .",
    "we thus fit a model of the form @xmath137 the fractional burst rates corresponding to the 90% and 99% confidence upper limits on the normalization @xmath138 in each model are given in table  [ tbl : uphomo ] .",
    "the upper limits were determined by finding the value of @xmath138 for which @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , when @xmath104 is minimized with respect to the other fit parameters ( @xcite ) . in all cases ,",
    "only a modest fraction , 510% , of the observed grbs could come from a homogeneous subpopulation ( and thus from nearby sne ) .",
    "these upper limits are comparable to the model - independent result found in the previous paragraph .",
    "they are slightly less constraining because of the fact that our peak flux distribution refers only to the 1.024 s time scale , so it takes no account of the paucity of faint bursts found on the 4.096 and 8.192 s time scales ( see section [ subsec : vvmax ] ) .",
    "these results were to be expected from the facts that 1 ) models d1 , d2 , and d3 with power - law luminosity distributions already gave excellent fits to the data without the presence of the homogeneous ( @xmath136 ) term , which is sharply peaked at low peak fluxes , and 2 ) the fractional uncertainties on the rates in each bin are on the order of 10% .",
    "the upper limits discussed here would be further reduced if a given grb must exhibit certain characteristics ( e.g. , single - peaked time profile , lack of emission above 300 kev ) in order to be considered a candidate s - grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "norris , bonnell , & watanabe ( 1998 ) have found that only 0.250.5% of batse grbs have temporal and spectral characteristics similar to grb 980425 .",
    "the grb peak flux distribution alone ( on the 1.024 s time scale ) only weakly distinguishes between the non - evolving model @xmath141 constant ( d1 ) and the evolving models where @xmath66 is proportional to an estimate of the star formation history ( d2 and d3 ) .",
    "( in this section we restrict our attention to models that include a power - law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities . )",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached previously by krumholz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who analyze the batse catalog data and find that to reliably distinguish the non - evolving and evolving models requires data from more sensitive grb detectors and/or the measurement of more individual grb redshifts .",

    "first , our search on the 1.024 s time scale can reach peak fluxes as low as 0.16 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 in the 50300 kev band ( 50% detection efficiency ) .",
    "but our searches on the 4.096 and 8.192 s time scales are sensitive to peak fluxes ( averaged over the matching time scale ) that are lower by factors of @xmath0 and @xmath144 , respectively , than the 1.024 s threshold . in fact",
    ", most of the bursts we detect have their highest signal - to - noise ratio in the 8.192 s search .",
    "yet surprisingly few bursts are detected _ exclusively _ on the longer 4.096 s and 8.192 s time scales .",
    "this suggests that there are relatively few faint grbs waiting to be detected by a search that is more sensitive than the one we carried out . in this respect ,",
    "the evolving models ( d2 and d3 ) appear to be more accurate .",
    "they predict that the number of bursts per logarithmic peak flux interval will level off towards lower peak fluxes , and may even start to decline ( see figure  [ fig : bestfit ] ) .",
    "the non - evolving model , on the other hand , predicts that the number of bursts observed per logarithmic peak flux interval will continue to increase towards lower peak fluxes .",
    "since we have not derived peak fluxes on the 4.096 and 8.192 s time scales in order to repeat the analysis of section [ subsec : purecos ] , we offer the following quantitative evidence that the paucity of bursts detected on the longer time scales favors the evolving models d2 and d3 over the non - evolving model d1 . on the 1.024 s time scale ,",
    "the measured value of @xmath145 is trivially consistent with the values of @xmath146 found for the best - fit models in section [ subsec : purecos ] .",
    "but the value of @xmath147 found for _ all _ bursts detected by our search contains information on the paucity of faint bursts on the 4.096 and 8.192 s time scales .",
    "we can compare it with the value of @xmath115 obtained by extrapolating the best - fit models of section [ subsec : purecos ] to the peak flux threshold associated with the 8.192 s search .",
    "taking @xmath148 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 as the approximate @xmath149 for the 8.192 s search , we obtain the following values for @xmath150 : 0.221 in model d1 , 0.169 in model d2 , and 0.147 in model d3 . thus model d2 produces a value of @xmath146 that is the most consistent with the value of @xmath37 found for our full sample , and model d1 produces the most inconsistent value .",
    "second , the inferred equivalent isotropic peak luminosities ( in the 302000 kev range ) of the 3 bursts for which associated redshifts have been measured can be compared with the effective luminosity distributions of the best - fit models . the best - fit non - evolving model ( d1 )",

    "the effective redshift distributions ( the rates of observed bursts as a function of redshift ) furnish another point of comparison with grbs 970508 , 971214 , 980613 , 980703 . as shown in figure  [ fig : effzee ] the model d1 predicts a vanishingly small rate of observed bursts from the redshift @xmath167 measured for grb 981214 ( @xcite ) . if model d1 were correct , then it would be remarkable that batse and _ bepposax _ detected such a rare burst : only @xmath168 of the rate distribution comes from higher redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolving models d2 and d3 predict much higher rates of observed bursts from @xmath167 . even in these models",
    ", however , such a high redshift is exceptional : in model d2 only 0.4% of the burst rate distribution lies beyond @xmath169 , and in model d3 only 1.8% does .",
    "still , as in the case of the inferred luminosity distributions , the 3 bursts with associated redshifts are a much more likely sample in models d2 and d3 , where the grb rate follows an estimate of the star formation history .",
    "these results certainly do not prove that the grb rate traces the star formation rate .",
    "the peak flux distributions alone fail to exclude the non - evolving rate density model ( d1 ) with high confidence , especially in view of the unknown cosmological parameters which can be varied to improve the fit . furthermore , until many more redshifts are associated with specific grbs and/or more sensitive grb detectors go on - line , the data will not be able to distinguish qualitatively similar sfr evolution models such as d2 and d3 .",
    "any evolution that specifies a significant peak in the burst rate in the redshift range @xmath142 is likely to be consistent with current data .",
    "the reasoning regarding the paucity of faint bursts detected _ only _ on the 4 s and 8 s time scales should be addressed more quantitatively in the context of the models ; but this is difficult owing to our poor understanding of the diverse time profiles of grbs and of the correlations between time profiles and peak fluxes .",
    "finally , we have considered only 3 very specific `` straw - man '' models , and it may be that none of them are particularly accurate representations of the true grb rate density and peak luminosity distributions .",
    "for example , a previous episode of star formation at high redshift could contribute a hitherto undetected population of very faint grbs .",
    "nevertheless , the results of our search appear to support the conclusions reached by totani ( 1997 ) , wijers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and krumholz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who showed that if the grb rate traces the sfr then relatively few faint `` classical '' grbs are to be found below the batse onboard detection threshold .",
    "this information should be useful to the designers and operators of future grb detectors .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cumrate ] we plot the cumulative rate distribution of the off - line sample of grbs along with the best fit models and their extrapolations to lower and higher peak fluxes than are available in the data .",
    "the best fit models apparently predict too many bright bursts above the maximum peak flux that was used to fit the differential burst rate ( 20.0 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising because the fits did not include data at high peak fluxes .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( @xcite ) indicates that the discrepancy is not significant if the data and best fit models are compared for _ all _ peak fluxes above 0.18 ph @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",

    "this means that the extrapolations of the best fit models are inaccurate at high peak fluxes .",
    "future research should explore the peak flux distribution over the widest possible range .",
    "for example , the grb detector onboard _ pioneer venus orbiter _",
    "( _ pvo _ ) operated for a much longer mission than has batse ( so far ) and it has more completely sampled the rate of very bright bursts .",
    "when the peak fluxes of the grbs detected with _",
    "pvo _ are calibrated to match the batse peak fluxes , it would be of interest to see if the parameters of the best - fit models found in this paper remain consistent with the number counts when the very bright bursts are included .",
    "figure  [ fig : cumrate ] shows that the slopes of the best - fit models approach the @xmath135 slope reported to be consistent with the brightest _ pvo _ bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the best - fit models are otherwise generally consistent with previous studies of the batse data .",
    "in particular we find that while we can not constrain the full width of the power - law luminosity function in any of the scenarios we considered , the best - fit models yield intrinsic peak luminosity functions that contain 90% of all grbs within a factor of 1020 .",

    "we find that the peak luminosity distribution of the observed bursts , however , is wider : in model d2 , 90% of the observed bursts come from a peak luminosity range that spans a factor of @xmath3 or more .",
    "a similar result is discussed by loredo & wasserman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the effective redshift distributions that we obtain ( see figure  [ fig : effzee ] ) are reasonably consistent with those obtained by krumholz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and mao & mo ( 1998 ) using the batse catalog data .",
    "they are also consistent with limits on the redshifts of grb sources set by the non - detection of any gravitationally lensed grbs in the batse catalogs ( @xcite ) .",

    "the values of @xmath171 we obtain for our best fit models ( see section [ subsec : purecos ] ) are all well within these limits .",

    "( 1998 ) that the faintest bursts observed with batse are at redshifts of @xmath173 .",

    "so , it is possible that grbs may be produced at redshifts as high as @xmath177 ; but even model d3 , which allows the highest redshifts , permits only a 7% chance that one or more such bursts have been observed among the 2265 in the off - line sample .    to summarize , our off - line search of archival batse data has explored the distribution of grb intensities at peak fluxes below the onboard detection threshold .",

    "<S> we have recently completed a search of 6 years of archival batse data for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) that were too faint to activate the real - time burst detection system running onboard the spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> these `` non - triggered '' bursts can be combined with the `` triggered '' bursts detected onboard to produce a grb intensity distribution that reaches peak fluxes a factor of @xmath0 lower than could be studied previously . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the @xmath1 statistic ( in euclidean space ) for the bursts we detect is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this surprisingly low value is obtained because we detected very few bursts on the 4.096 s and 8.192 s time scales ( where most bursts have their highest signal - to - noise ratio ) that were not already detected on the 1.024 s time scale . </S>",
    "<S> if allowance is made for a power - law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities , the extended peak flux distribution is consistent with models in which the redshift distribution of the gamma - ray burst rate approximately traces the star formation history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this class of models is preferred over those in which the burst rate is independent of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we use the peak flux distribution to derive a limit of 10% ( 99% confidence ) on the fraction of the total burst rate that could be contributed by a spatially homogeneous ( in euclidean space ) subpopulation of burst sources , such as type ib / c supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> these results lend support to the conclusions of previous studies predicting that relatively few faint `` classical '' grbs will be found below the batse onboard detection threshold . </S>"
