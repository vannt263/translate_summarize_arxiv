    "it is known that some starburst galaxies have significantly high @xmath12co(@xmath2=10)@xmath13co(@xmath2=10 ) integrated line intensity ratios , @xmath14 , while typical galaxies have @xmath15 ( aalto et al .",
    "1991 , 1995 ; casoli , dupraz , & combes 1992a , 1992b ; turner & hurt 1992 ; garay , mardones , & mirabel 1993 ; henkel et al .",
    "recently taniguchi & ohyama ( 1998 ; hereafter to98 ) have shown that the observed higher @xmath6 values are mainly attributed to the lower intensity in @xmath1co(@xmath2=10 ) with respect to @xmath0co(@xmath2=10 ) .",
    "this finding suggests that the @xmath1co depression provides an important clue to the understanding physical properties of the interstellar medium in the starburst galaxies because these properties should be controlled by the star formation histories in them .",
    "interestingly , almost all the high-@xmath6 starburst galaxies show morphological evidence for major mergers and their far - infrared luminosities are generally high ; e.g. , @xmath9(fir ) @xmath16 ( to98 ) . among the high-@xmath6",
    "starburst galaxies , arp 220 indeed belongs to a class of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter uligs , sanders et al . 1988",
    "; see for a review sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the origin of the high-@xmath6 starburst galaxies seems to be physically related to that of uligs . in this letter , in order to understand the origin of huge fir luminosities of the high-@xmath6 starburst galaxies , we present a statistical analysis for the galaxy sample studied by to98 .",
    "all the data analyzed here are taken from to98 .",
    "the to98 sample contains eight high-@xmath6 starburst mergers with @xmath14 ( hereafter high-@xmath6 mergers ) and 43 non - high-@xmath6 galaxies with @xmath15 ( hereafter normal-@xmath6 galaxies ) .",
    "the high-@xmath6 starburst mergers are ngc 1614 , ngc 3256 , ngc 4194 , ngc 6240 , arp 220 , arp 236 ( eso 541ig 23 ) , arp 299 , and iras 18293@xmath173413 . among the 43 normal-@xmath6 galaxies , two galaxies ,",
    "ngc 55 and ngc 404 , are dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , we omit them in the later statistical analysis .",
    "the galaxies analyzed here were selected solely by a criterion that both @xmath0co(@xmath2=10 ) and @xmath1co(@xmath2=10 ) data are available in the literature .",
    "therefore our sample is not a statistically complete one in any sense .",
    "however , this is enough to investigate the difference between the high-@xmath6 mergers and the normal-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "note also that some starburst galaxies such as ngc 253 are included in the normal-@xmath6 sample .",
    "this suggests that the observed high-@xmath6 values in the starburst mergers are not due to the starburst activity itself and thus some other mechanisms should be responsible for them .    for the remaining 49 galaxies , we derive dust temperatures ( @xmath7 ) using iras 60@xmath18 m and 100@xmath18 m fluxes ( moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) . here",
    "we assume the dust emissivity law , @xmath11 .",
    "we also estimate the mass of dust which is responsible for the radiation at 60@xmath18 m and 100@xmath18 m from @xmath19^{-1}$ ] where @xmath20 is the grain radius , @xmath21 is the grain density , @xmath22 is the distance of galaxy , @xmath23 is the iras 100@xmath18 m flux , @xmath24 is the grain emissivity at 100 @xmath18 m , and @xmath25 is the value of planck function at 100 @xmath18 m ( e.g. , hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "following devereux & young ( 1990 ) , we use a simplified formula @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the grain opacity . adopting @xmath28 @xmath29 g@xmath30 ( hildebrand 1983 )",
    ", we use @xmath31 in our analysis .",
    "the distance is in units of mpc .",
    "statistical properties of the sample are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the high-@xmath6 mergers have both brighter @xmath9(fir ) and @xmath32co ) for their @xmath8 .",
    "indeed the average @xmath9(fir ) and @xmath32co ) of the high-@xmath6 mergers are higher by factors of 20.0 and 10.7 , respectively , than those of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the average @xmath33co ) and @xmath8 of the high-@xmath6 mergers are higher than those of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies only by factors of 4.4 and 6.3 , respectively .    in figure 1 , we show diagrams of @xmath32co ) , @xmath33co ) , and @xmath8 against @xmath9(fir ) . as shown by to98 , although there is a tight correlation between @xmath32co ) and @xmath9(fir ) , @xmath33co ) becomes lower with increasing @xmath9(fir ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 1 shows that the dust mass also becomes lower with increasing @xmath9(fir ) , suggesting that the dust content in the high-@xmath6 mergers is more intimately related to the @xmath1co gas content . in order to confirm this",
    ", we show diagrams of @xmath32co ) and @xmath33co ) against @xmath8 in figure 2 .",
    "we find that there is a tight , almost linear correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath33co ) for all the galaxies analyzed here ; log @xmath9(@xmath1co ) = ( 0.942@xmath340.064 ) log @xmath35 with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that dust grains are more intimately associated with @xmath1co gas rather than with @xmath0co gas and that both the @xmath1co gas and dust grains are depressed in the high-@xmath6 mergers .",
    "although the average dust mass of the high-@xmath6 mergers is higher by a factor of 6.3 than that of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies , this average dust mass is not as high as that expected from the higher @xmath0co luminosities of the high-@xmath6 mergers ; the average dust mass of the high-@xmath6 mergers is lower by a factor of 1.7 than that expected if their @xmath36co ) ratios are nearly the same as those of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "the present analysis has shown that both the dust and the @xmath1co gas are more depressed in the high-@xmath6 mergers with respect to the @xmath0co gas .",
    "we consider a possible effect of the dust depression on the @xmath9(fir ) in the high-@xmath6 mergers . since the fir emission is generally believed to arise from large grains which are in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field ( e.g. , mouri , kawara , & taniguchi 1997 and references therein ) , the dust temperature is related to the radiation density ( @xmath37 ) such that @xmath38 ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) . since the average dust temperatures are 43.7 k and 35.4 k for the high-@xmath6 mergers and the normal-@xmath6 galaxies , respectively ( table 1 ) , the radiation density in the high-@xmath6 mergers is higher by a factor of 2.3 than that in the normal-@xmath6 galaxies . since @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the luminosity responsible for heating dust grains , the relative depression in @xmath8 leads to the increase in @xmath37 by a factor of 1.7 , which can almost explain the relative higher radiation density in the high-@xmath6 mergers .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the higher radiation density in the starburst mergers is achieved by the relative depression of dust grains .",
    "the fir luminosity is proportional to the product of the dust mass and a high power of the dust temperature such that @xmath9(fir ) @xmath10 given the dust emissivity law , @xmath11 .",
    "the average dust mass of the high-@xmath6 mergers is higher by a factor of 6.3 than that of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "this higher dust mass can be attributed to the accumulation from the progenitor galaxies because the starburst mergers should come from mergers between or among gas - rich galaxies ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; taniguchi & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "also , it is expected that dust grains could form efficiently in the intense star forming regions ( e.g. , wang 1991 ) .",
    "however , the huge fir luminosities of the high-@xmath6 mergers can not be explained solely by the higher dust mass in them because the average @xmath9(fir ) of the high-@xmath6 mergers is higher by a factor of 20 than that of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies ( table 1 ) .",
    "therefore we have to take account of another factor , @xmath41 , which enhances the average fir luminosity of the high-@xmath6 mergers by a factor of @xmath42 with respect to that of the normal-@xmath6 galaxies although the increase in @xmath8 is primarily important .",
    "accordingly , the increases in both @xmath43 and @xmath7 are indeed responsible for the enhancement of the fir luminosity of the high-@xmath6 mergers on the average by a factor of 18 ( @xmath44 ) with respect to the normal-@xmath6 galaxies , being comparable to the actual difference ( @xmath45 ) between them .      we consider why dust grains are depressed in the high-@xmath6 mergers . galaxy mergers cause efficient gas fueling toward the nuclear regions of the merging systems that ultimately can trigger intense starbursts , either as a result of the piling of gas ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ) or by the dynamical effect of supermassive binary black holes ( taniguchi & wada 1996 ) .",
    "multiple mergers are also responsible for the formation of starburst mergers ( taniguchi & shioya 1998 )",
    ". the dense gas clouds in which the majority of dust grains may be present were consumed in the past starburst activity .",
    "this may explain partly the relative depression of both dense gas traced by @xmath1co and dust grains .",
    "another key process is the so - called superwind which is a blast wave driven by a collective effect of a large number of supernovae ( heckman , armus , & miley 1987 , 1990 ; heckman et al . 1996 ; taniguchi , trentham , & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "since it is generally considered that dust grains in the interstellar medium are destroyed mainly by fast shocks driven by supernova explosions through processes of both sputtering and grain - grain collisions ( e.g. , mckee 1989 ) , it is very likely that superwinds occurring shortly after the starbursts lead to the destruction of dust grains .",
    "we investigate whether or not there is evidence for shock heating driven by superwinds in the high-@xmath6 mergers studied here . in order to examine the predominance of shock heating , we show an optical excitation diagram of [ n ii]@xmath466583/h@xmath47 vs. [ o iii]@xmath465007/h@xmath48 ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) in figure 3 .",
    "the optical emission - line data are taken from armus et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and kim et al .",
    "the three high-@xmath6 mergers ( ngc 1614 , ngc 6240 , and arp 220 ) show liner - like excitation .",
    "ngc 4194 and arp 299 are also close to the domain of the liner .",
    "the recent mid - infrared spectroscopy by genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggests that ngc 6240 and arp 220 are star - formation dominated objects .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that their optical emission - line nebulae are powered by the putative central engine of active galactic nuclei in them . thus their liner - like excitation conditions can be attributed to shock heating ( see also veilleux et al . 1995",
    "; kim et al . 1998 ; taniguchi et al . 1998 ) . in order to examine if the liner - like excitation can be explained by shock heating , we show results of shock heating models by dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) in figure 3 .",
    "the excitation properties of both arp 220 and ngc 6240 can be explained by fast shock models with the shock velocity of @xmath49 300  400 km s@xmath30 . since the h@xmath47 line widths of these galaxies are @xmath49 600 km s@xmath30 and @xmath49 900 km s@xmath30 , respectively ( armus et al .",
    "1989 ) , the shock interpretation seems reasonable .",
    "we also note that the remaining h ii region like objects have narrower line widths , e.g. , a few 100 km s@xmath30 ( armus et al .",
    "therefore , these objects may be in late phases of the superwind activity ; e.g. , a few 10@xmath50 years after the onset of the superwind . since the time scale of injection of dust grains from stars is @xmath51 years ( mckee 1989 ) , these galaxies may still have relatively small amount of dust grains .",
    "heckman et al . ( 1987 ) first noted that starburst galaxies with evidence for superwinds have unusual iras colors ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 log[@xmath55/log(@xmath56 ( see also heckman et al .",
    "the higher dust temperatures of the high-@xmath6 mergers explain the condition @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath57 42 k under the dust emissivity law , @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "if small grains are destroyed efficiently by the superwinds , together with possible extinction even at 25 @xmath18 m ( e.g. , condon et al . 1991 ) , iras 25 @xmath18 m emission should be quenched significantly , resulting in the condition of @xmath52 .",
    "although we can not give any quantitative discussion here , the above consideration explains the unusual iras colors of the superwind galaxies qualitatively .",
    "finally we consider why the observational properties of the high-@xmath6 mergers are different significantly from those of other star - forming galaxies .",
    "one interesting property of the starbursts in galaxy mergers is that the ages of the starbursts are often estimated as old as @xmath58 years , being older than the typical starburst , @xmath59 years ( e.g. , mouri & taniguchi 1992 ; prestwich , joseph , & wright 1994 ) .",
    "further , poststarburst regions traced by a large number of a - type stars are often found in the circumnuclear regions of the mergers ( armus , heckman , & miley 1989 ; larkin et al .",
    "these suggest that the superwind activity could occur in some recent epochs in the high-@xmath6 mergers ; e.g. , @xmath60 years ago for arp 220 ( heckman et al .",
    "another important property of the high-@xmath6 mergers is that a huge amount of molecular gas is concentrated in their central region ( scoville et al .",
    "1991 , 1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "this means that starbursts occurred in the very gas - rich environment .",
    "in fact , the molecular gas surface density in the central region of arp 220 , @xmath61 @xmath62 , is higher by a few orders of magnitudes than those in typical starburst galaxies such as ic 342 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "thus the dense gas clouds in the high-@xmath6 mergers are inevitably affected by the superwind activity ( taniguchi , trentham , & shioya 1998 ) , leading to the depression of both dense gas and dust grains . in summary ,",
    "the long - lasting starbursts in the very gas - rich environment make the high-@xmath6 mergers a particular class of starburst galaxies with superwinds .",
