    "light bridges ( lbs ) are bright structures in the otherwise dark umbra that often exhibit a granular - like morphology @xcite .",
    "they represent a discontinuity or interruption in the regular umbral field @xcite .",
    "lbs are known to harbor weak and inclined fields @xcite , but their origin and magnetic nature is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons that make lbs interesting is their chromospheric activity , seen as surges in h@xmath1 @xcite , localized brightenings in h filtergrams @xcite , and brightness enhancements in the upper chromosphere and transition region @xcite .",
    "the stressed magnetic configuration associated with lbs is perceived to be responsible for this activity , but the precise relationship , if any , is yet to be established .",
    "unfortunately , there is a lack of simultaneous vector magnetic field measurements in the photosphere to diagnose these events .    here",
    "we analyze _ hinode _ spectropolarimetric observations and h filtergrams of a sunspot lb in an attempt to relate its chromospheric activity to the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "we discover patches of supersonic downflows in the photospheric layers of the lb and show that some of them are associated with strong h brightness enhancements .",
    "interestingly , the supersonic flows produce spectral signatures never seen before in lbs .",
    "on 2007 may 1 , the leading spot of noaa active region 10953 was observed with _ hinode _",
    "@xcite at a heliocentric angle of 8@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "between 10:46 and 12:25 ut , the _ hinode _",
    "spectropolarimeter @xcite recorded the four stokes profiles of the iron lines at 630 nm with a spectral sampling of 21.55 m , a pixel size of 016 , and an exposure time of 4.8  s per slit position ( normal map mode ) .",
    "the observations were corrected for dark current , flat field , thermal flexures , and instrumental polarization using routines included in the solarsoft package .",
    "simultaneously , the broadband filter imager of _ hinode _ took h filtergrams with a cadence of 1 minute to monitor the chromosphere of the lb .",
    "the effective pixel size of the ca images is 011 .",
    "[ sunspot_image ]",
    "the left panel of figure  [ sunspot_image ] shows a continuum map of the spot and the lb . we have inverted the observed stokes profiles using the sir code ( stokes inversion based on response functions ; * ? ? ?",
    "sir computes perturbations in the physical quantities at specific locations across the optical depth grid called _ nodes _ , and then carries out an interpolation to yield values at all grid points . to determine the global structure of the lb and the surroundings",
    ", we performed a one - component inversion setting the magnetic and dynamic parameters to be constant with depth .",
    "the temperature stratification was perturbed with two nodes .",
    "a total of 9 parameters were retrieved from the observed profiles , including height - independent micro- and macro - turbulent velocities and a stray - light factor .",
    "the three components of the vector magnetic field ( strength , inclination , and azimuth ) deduced from the inversion are shown in the second and third columns of figure  [ sunspot_image ] .",
    "all the angles are expressed in the local reference frame after a manual disambiguation of the line - of - sight ( los ) azimuths .",
    "as can be seen , the lb is characterized by weaker and more inclined fields than the umbra .",
    "this confirms earlier results by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . in the upper half of the lb ,",
    "the magnetic field is parallel to the axis of the bridge .",
    "both photometrically and magnetically , the lb looks like an extension of the penumbra protruding into the umbra .",
    "@xcite detected a horizontal flow along the lb that starts in the adjacent penumbra , demonstrating that the two structures are also connected dynamically . at the lower end of the lb , where the lb fields pointing south encounter sunspot fields oriented toward the north , one observes an isolated region with relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , there is a discontinuity in the field azimuth running parallel to the west edge of the lb .",
    "the los velocity map displayed in the third column of figure  [ sunspot_image ] reveals the existence of strong , localized downflows in the lb with velocities of up to 4 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the downflows occur close to the weak - field region and the azimuth discontinuity described above , i.e. , at positions where the magnetic field changes orientation very rapidly ( fourth column of figure  [ sunspot_image ] ) .",
    "some of the downflowing patches coincide with chromospheric h brightness enhancements , as can be seen in figure  [ calcium ] .",
    "the filtergram displayed there was taken during the polarimetric scan of the lb and shows a strong h line - core brightening at the position and time of the largest photospheric velocities ) .",
    "these structures show brightenings , but not as intense as those associated with the strongest downflows . ] .",
    "noaa ar 10953 produced many other long - lasting chromospheric plasma ejections on april 29 and 30 @xcite .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 profiles associated with the downflows have two peaks in the red lobe , i.e. , they exhibit a total of three peaks .",
    "hereafter they will be labelled as type 1 . in the lb",
    "one also finds anomalous linear polarization profiles with normal stokes @xmath4 signals which are designated as type 2 .",
    "type 3 profiles are essentially a combination of the other two classes .",
    "examples of these profiles are given in figure  [ combo_plots ] , together with their spatial distribution .",
    "milne - eddington - like atmospheres such as the ones used to determine the global structure of the lb can not reproduce the complex shapes of type 1 profiles .",
    "for this reason , the velocities given in section  [ sir ] are only approximate .",
    "here we obtain more reliable values with the help of two - component inversions .",
    "are shown in blue .",
    "the arrows indicate the transverse component of the field in the local reference frame for every alternate pixel , after solving the 180@xmath2 azimuth ambiguity .",
    "white and black contours represent fields weaker than 750 g and bright continuum structures , respectively .",
    "the white dashed lines mark thin chromospheric threads whose ends are located in or near the downflowing patches . , scaledwidth=44.0% ]                     we start with a simple two - component model in which the magnetic field and the los velocity do not vary with height . the results of this inversion are presented in figure 4 .",
    "as can be seen , one of the components has supersonic velocities of @xmath5 km  s@xmath0 and the other is essentially at rest .",
    "the model explains the observed profiles in a very satisfactory way , but the assumption of two magnetic components separated horizontally in the resolution element may not be realistic because of the relatively large sizes of the downwflowing patches ( 0.5 - 0.7 arcsec ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that they are stacked in the vertical direction , one on top of the other .    to investigate this possibility we consider a different model atmosphere with two magnetic components .",
    "one of them has height - independent parameters and the other features a discontinuity in the stratifications at a certain optical depth .",
    "the amplitude and the location of the discontinuity are free parameters .",
    "these inversions have been carried out using sirjump , an extension of the sir code ( bellot rubio , in preparation ) .",
    "the results show that the fast component always has velocities exceeding 10 km  s@xmath0 . as an example",
    ", figure  [ inv_results2 ] displays the stratifications of one such model with the downflows occurring in the lower half of the photosphere .",
    "while the two - component models used in this section differ in complexity , all of them indicate supersonic velocities and magnetic fields of the same polarity .",
    "in fact , the existence of supersonic flows is obvious from the shapes of the observed stokes @xmath4 profiles , which are similar to those emerging from the outer part of the penumbra where the evershed flow exceeds the sound speed .",
    "the inclined red wings of stokes @xmath6 also demonstrate the occurrence of strong velocities .",
    "all these spectral signatures are well reproduced by the two - component inversions . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that supersonic downflows are found in lbs .",
    "subsonic speeds of @xmath71 km  s@xmath0 have been reported earlier by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .      in regions where the magnetic field is relatively horizontal ,",
    "the supersonic flows are associated with type 3 profiles .",
    "they have similar stokes @xmath6 and @xmath4 spectra as type 1 profiles , but also complex linear polarization signals which can not be seen when the field is more vertical .",
    "we observe anomalous stokes @xmath8 profiles with up to five peaks and signatures of strong redshifts ( figure  [ combo_plots ] , left ) .",
    "the multiple peaks indicate that different magnetic components coexist in the resolution element at the position of the downflows .",
    "type 3 profiles are common near the azimuth discontinuity on the west side of the lb , where the lb fields meet the umbral fields ( figure  [ combo_plots ] , right ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that these are the magnetic components giving rise to the complex stokes @xmath8 signals .",
    "they may lie horizontally next to each other in the resolution element , or could be stacked one on top of the other . in both cases the large variations of field azimuth that occur on very small spatial scales should facilitate the reconnection of magnetic field lines from the lb and the adjacent umbra , even if they have the same polarity @xcite .",
    "the interaction is expected to produce bidirectional jets , and we speculate that the supersonic downflows observed near the azimuth discontinuity and the weak - field region are the signatures of reconnection jets directed toward the photosphere .",
    "this would agree with @xcite , who believe that the lb is essentially a horizontal , twisted flux tube that reconnects with the umbral field at a low altitude .",
    "however , our measurements can not confirm the reconnection scenario unambiguously because the upward jet components are not always visible in the h images .",
    "indeed , another possibility is that the supersonic downflows are produced by a mechanism similar to that driving the evershed flow at the outer end of penumbral filaments .",
    "we have determined the global magnetic and dynamic properties of a sunspot light bridge from the inversion of stokes profiles observed by _",
    "a one - component model atmosphere with height - independent parameters ( except for the temperature ) has been used to that end .",
    "our analysis reveals patches of strong downflows exceeding 4  km  s@xmath0 in the lb , associated with complex stokes @xmath4 spectra having double red lobes .",
    "two - component inversions of the profiles indicate supersonic velocities of 10 km  s@xmath0 or more .",
    "a milne - eddington inversion by @xcite of the same lb on the previous day shows only a small downflow patch with velocities of 0.7 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the supersonic downflows occur in regions where the magnetic field of the lb meets sunspot fields with rather different orientations . in those locations",
    "one observes anomalous linear polarization signals , but only when the field is relatively horizontal .",
    "moreover , the supersonic downflows are sometimes associated with transient chromospheric brightenings . the interaction of the lb field and the sunspot fields may create current sheets , leading to magnetic reconnection in the upper photosphere / lower chromosphere .",
    "the strong photospheric flows could represent the downward directed jets generated in this process .",
    "however , such an explanation remains speculative because the associated upward jets are not always seen as chromospheric brightenings .",
    "the discovery of supersonic downflows in lbs has been possible due to the high spatial resolution and stability of _ hinode _ , but their interpretation is still unclear .",
    "additional observations should be performed to investigate the chromosphere and photosphere of lbs simultaneously , in an attempt to detect small brightness enhancements that would confirm the reconnection scenario or favor alternative explanations .",
    "our sincere thanks to the _ hinode _ team for providing the data used in this letter , and to the referee for valuable suggestions .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in co - operation with esa and nsc ( norway ) .",
