    "particle acceleration remains a mystery in solar flares , as well as in cosmic rays from the extrasolar systems .",
    "observationally , the energetic particles always show a single or double power - law spectral behavior .",
    "three mechanisms have been proposed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) , i.e. , the direct current ( dc ) electric field acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , turbulence ( or stochastic ) acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic reconnection , as the effective mechanism for magnetic energy release in solar flares , was demonstrated to be able to provide environments favorable for all the above - mentioned acceleration mechanisms to work @xcite .",
    "dc electric field provides the simplest and most direct means of accelerating particles out of a thermal plasma @xcite , which even allows for an analytical solution of each particle trajectory under certain assumptions @xcite . in the case that the electric and magnetic fields induced by the accelerated particles are negligible , test particle simulations provide a simple and valid approach to study the particle acceleration in a reconnection - associated electric and magnetic fields . for example , @xcite showed that protons and electrons can be promptly accelerated ( within 1 s ) up to @xmath070 mev and @xmath0200 mev , respectively . in order to compare the resulting energy spectrum of the dc - accelerated protons with observations",
    ", @xcite conducted test particle simulations with a hyperbolic magnetic field and a uniform electric field .",
    "the accelerated protons present a universal power - law spectrum , @xmath1 , with the spectral index @xmath2 being @xmath3 .",
    "thereafter , a lot of test particle simulations have been performed for electrons as well , through either full orbit calculations @xcite or guiding center calculations @xcite .",
    "almost all of these simulations claimed to have obtained a power - law energy spectrum , with a spectral index around 2 , similar to that for protons .",
    "it is noted , however , that the energy spectra in many of the published simulation results deviate significantly from a power - law profile . moreover , according to the thick - target model , the resulting bremsstrahlung hard x - ray ( hxr ) emissions in these simulations would present a power - law energy spectrum with a spectral index around 1 .",
    "however , the rhessi observations indicated that the hxr emissions in most solar flares possess much softer spectra , with the spectral indices falling in the range between 3 and 7 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , several factors may be attributed to such a big discrepancy .",
    "for example , the parameters of the reconnecting current sheet were chosen arbitrarily due to our poor knowledge of the physical conditions in the localized reconnection region in solar flares .",
    "most importantly , the electric and magnetic fields , which should be coupled with each other through mhd equations , were often prescribed independently . doing so often results in the electric and magnetic fields that are not compatible with the mhd equations .",
    "some improvements were made in recent years .",
    "for example , @xcite derived the electric field via the ohm s law after assuming the distributions of the magnetic field , the velocity field , and the resistivity .",
    "a further progress was made by @xcite , who deduced the solution of the linearized mhd equations by assuming that the longitudinal component of the magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) and the velocity ( @xmath5 ) are small perturbations . in the real case",
    ", both @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be quite large , therefore , it is necessary to obtain the electric and magnetic fields by directly solving the mhd equations .    in order to obtain self - consistent electric and magnetic fields , in this paper we first perform 2.5-dimensional mhd simulations of the resistive evolution of a current sheet .",
    "when a steady state is reached , the electric and magnetic fields are then taken out for test particle simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "the numerical method is described , including the mhd and test particle simulations .",
    "the shape of the resulting energy spectrum is discussed in  3 , and a parameter survey is conducted showing the influences of various parameters on the spectral features in  4 .",
    "a short discussion is presented in  5 .",
    "in order to obtain self - consistent electric and magnetic fields , we numerically solve the following 2.5-dimensional ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) , time - dependent , compressible resistive mhd equations with a multi - step implicit scheme @xcite :    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath13 is the dimensionless resistivity , that is , the inverse of the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "the last term on the left - hand side of equation ( [ ener ] ) is the field - aligned heat conduction , where @xmath14 $ ] , and @xmath15 is the dimensionless coefficient ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the five independent variables are the density ( @xmath16 ) , velocity ( @xmath5 ) , magnetic flux function ( @xmath17 ) , the longitudinal component of the magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) , and temperature ( @xmath18 ) ; note that the magnetic field @xmath19 is related to the magnetic flux function through @xmath20 .",
    "when nondimensionalizing the mhd equations , the characteristic density and temperature are fixed to be @xmath21 kg m@xmath22 and @xmath23 k , respectively . while , the length scale ( @xmath24 ) and the plasma beta ( @xmath25 ) are free parameters . the velocity is normalized by the isothermal sound speed @xmath26 , and the time is therefore by @xmath27 .",
    "another time scale , the alfvn transit time @xmath28 , is related to @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "the dimensionless resistivity @xmath13 is distributed as    @xmath31 , & if $ |x| \\leq 0.1 $ ,                          $ |y-4| \\leq 0.25 $ , \\cr                  0 , &   elsewhere,\\cr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is also a free parameter .    as the initial conditions , uniform density ( @xmath33 ) and temperature ( @xmath34 ) are assumed .",
    "the initial magnetic field is chosen to be a force - free field with a vertical current sheet located along the @xmath35-axis , which is written as    @xmath36    @xmath37    where the half - width of the current sheet is @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the longitudinal magnetic field ( i.e. , the guide component ) in the background .",
    "the dimensionless size of the simulation box is @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "because of the symmetry , the calculation is made only in the top right quadrant .",
    "the top ( @xmath42 ) and the right - hand ( @xmath43 ) sides are treated as open boundaries .",
    "symmetry conditions are applied to the left - hand boundary ( @xmath44 ) and the bottom ( @xmath45 ) of the simulation quadrant .",
    "the detailed description of the mhd simulation can be found in @xcite .    as the localized resistivity sets in , the elongated current sheet dissipates and collapses into an x - type magnetic configuration .",
    "after @xmath46 , the dynamics of the whole simulation region becomes steady , keeping all physical quantities almost invariant with time .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the distributions of the temperature ( _ gray scale _ ) , the magnetic field ( _ solid lines _ ) , and the velocity ( _ vector arrows _ ) for the case with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "note that at the steady state , the @xmath51-component of the magnetic field near the reconnection x - point is around @xmath39 .",
    "the small rectangular box in figure [ f1 ] indicates the region where the resistivity does not vanish and where test particles are injected .    the corresponding electric field ( @xmath52 )",
    "is then determined by the ohm s law , i.e. , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is nondimensionalized by the characteristic value of @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the normalization unit of the magnetic field ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "thereby , the electric and magnetic fields are obtained for the ensuing test particle simulations . as an example , in the case of @xmath57 and @xmath32= 0.01 , the electric field at the reconnection site is @xmath58 v m@xmath59 , which is super - dreicer .",
    "test electrons are uniformly distributed in the resistive region , which is indicated by the rectangle in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "initially , these electrons have a maxwellian velocity distribution with the local plasma temperature , which is superimposed on the local plasma bulk velocity . the motion of each electron is then calculated by numerically solving the following relativistic lorentz equations    @xmath60",
    "@xmath61    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the particle position and velocity vectors , respectively ; @xmath64 is the lorentz factor , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the rest mass and the charge of the electron , respectively ; @xmath54 and @xmath67 are the electric and magnetic fields obtained from the mhd simulations as described in the previous subsection .",
    "it is noted here that collisions are neglected in the momentum equation ( [ momen ] ) .",
    "the 4th - order runge - kutta - fehlberg ( rkf45 ) scheme is used to solve the above equations , where the time step ( @xmath68 ) is adaptive . in order to get smooth energy spectra ,",
    "@xmath69 test particles are simulated .    in order to confirm our test particle code",
    ", we repeated the simulations of proton acceleration that were performed by @xcite , with the same electric and magnetic fields , i.e. , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we chose the same parameters as in @xcite and found that the spectral indices are about 1.9 - 2.3 , almost identical to their result , i.e. , 2.0 - 2.2 .",
    "the electrons are accelerated under the action of the dc electric field promptly . at the same time , they gyro - rotate around the magnetic field lines . after certain rounds of gyro - rotation ,",
    "the accelerated electrons drift out of the resistive region , and then propagate away along magnetic separatrix layers between the reconnection inflow and outflow . since the acceleration and the propagation of the electrons are 2-fold rotational symmetric , the particles going upward and downward are collected together to construct their energy spectrum .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f2 ] plots the energy spectrum in a log - log scale for the case with @xmath47 , @xmath24=100 m , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . to our surprise ,",
    "the spectrum , which is quite smooth except for the high energy tail , does not show a single power - law profile ( note that a single power - law profile is manifested as a linear line in the log - log scale ) .",
    "apparently , it looks like a double power - law profile , as proposed in our recent review paper @xcite . the spectral profile",
    "is then fitted with a double power - law distribution , i.e. , a harder power - law spectrum @xmath72 in the energy range of 2 - 40 kev ( _ red line _ ) plus a softer power - law spectrum @xmath73 in the energy range of 50 - 120 kev ( _ blue line _ ) .",
    "it is noted that the spectral index at the high energy tail in our simulation is significantly higher than those obtained in the published test particle simulations , and is in the typical range of the electron spectral indices derived from hxr spectral observations .",
    "the hxr observations from rhessi did find double ( or broken ) power - law spectral profiles in some flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and theoretical models have also been proposed to explain this feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the profile in the left panel of figure [ f2 ] is , however , somewhat different from the broken power - law distribution of @xcite in that the spectral profile changes gradually between the two power - law parts in our simulation results , while the transition is abrupt in the observation @xcite .    in order to clarify the spectral distribution of the accelerated electrons in our simulations , we re - plot the energy spectrum in a linear - log scale in the right panel of figure [ f2 ] .",
    "it is seen that , except for the significantly enhanced lower energy tail , the spectral profile is almost a linear line in a wide energy range , which means that the spectrum is close to be exponential in most of the energy range .",
    "considering the low energy tail , we fit the spectral profile with the combination of an exponential and a power - law functions , i.e. , @xmath74 . with the spectral index @xmath75 and the rollover energy @xmath76=23.1 kev , the fitted line ( _ pink _ ) , as shown in the right panel of figure [ f2 ] , is consistent with the simulation result in most of the energy range , from 8 to over 120 kev .",
    "although it was claimed by many authors that dc electric field in magnetic reconnection leads to a power - law energy spectrum of the accelerated electrons , quite often the spectrum obtained from test particle simulations deviates significantly from a perfect power - law distribution .",
    "several authors already noted that the energy spectrum of the dc - accelerated electrons may be characterized as either power - law or exponential , depending on the value of @xmath4 @xcite or the trapping time of the electrons inside the acceleration volume @xcite .",
    "the test particle simulations in this paper , with self - consistent electric and magnetic fields obtained from mhd simulations , indicate that the electrons accelerated by the dc electric field of magnetic reconnection present a spectrum with the form    @xmath77    which is similar to those obtained in the diffusive shock acceleration when the power - law behavior is truncated by a variety of effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussions ) .",
    "the same spectral profile was also obtained in the electron acceleration by random dc electric field @xcite .",
    "it is , however , mentioned here that among all our simulated scenarios , only in one case with @xmath78 , @xmath24=50 m , @xmath48 , and @xmath79 , the energy spectrum does show a clear broken power - law shape .",
    "several parameters can affect the energy spectral profile of the dc - accelerated electrons in our simulations , where the spectral profile is characterized by @xmath2 and @xmath76 as indicated by equation ( [ eqa ] ) .",
    "the free parameters include the longitudinal component of the magnetic field ( @xmath39 ) , the length scale ( @xmath24 ) , the resistivity ( @xmath32 ) , and the magnetic field strength , as represented by the plasma beta ( @xmath25 ) . in the following subsections , the effect of varying each parameter",
    "is investigated individually with other parameters keeping fixed .      by theoretical analysis of electron acceleration in a reconnecting current sheet ,",
    "@xcite propounded that a longitudinal component of magnetic field is necessary to explain the accelerated electrons with energy up to 100 kev . in our simulations , the longitudinal component ( i.e. , the guide component along the @xmath51-direction ) of the magnetic field near the reconnection x - point is around @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we calculated six cases with @xmath39 increasing from 0 to 1.0 , while the other parameters are @xmath24=50 m , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the energy spectra of the accelerated electrons in the six cases are depicted in the upper panel of figure [ f3 ] .",
    "it is clear that , as @xmath39 increases , more and more electrons are accelerated to high energies , which confirms the importance of longitudinal magnetic field in accelerating electrons to higher energies @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath76 on @xmath39 is plotted in the lower panel of figure [ f3 ] .",
    "it is found that as @xmath39 increases , @xmath76 increases steadily , while @xmath2 first falls rapidly when @xmath39 increases from 0 to 0.4 , and then increases slowly .    in order to study the efficiency of dc acceleration",
    ", we calculate the percentage of electrons whose energy is higher than 10 kev , and define it as the acceleration rate .",
    "we find that when @xmath39 is zero , few particles are accelerated and the acceleration rate is 0.0475% .",
    "however , when @xmath39 reaches 1 , the acceleration rate jumps to 11.3% .",
    "the size of the current sheet is an important but unknown parameter in the flaring process .",
    "therefore , it is worth studying how this parameter would affect the energy spectrum of the electrons .",
    "as shown in figure [ f1 ] , the initial size of the reconnection sheet is @xmath80 , where @xmath24 is the length scale of the mhd simulations . with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath49 being fixed , test particle simulations are conducted in four cases with @xmath24 being 10 , 50 , 100 , and 200 m , respectively . the upper panel of figure [ f4 ] shows the energy spectra of the accelerated electrons in the four cases .",
    "it is seen that as @xmath24 increases , more and more electrons are accelerated to high energies .",
    "this is easy to understand since as @xmath24 increases , electrons travel a longer distance in the electric field before they migrate out of the acceleration region due to gyration . the dependencies of @xmath2 and @xmath76 on @xmath24 are shown in the lower panel of figure [ f4 ] .",
    "it is seen that @xmath76 increases almost linearly with @xmath24 , while @xmath2 initially increases rapidly with @xmath24 , and then saturates after @xmath24=100 m. we calculated the fraction of the electrons with energies exceeding 10 kev , and found that the acceleration rate increases from 4.49% to 26.3% as @xmath24 increases from 10 to 200 m.      in the petschek model for magnetic reconnection @xcite , the electric field near the reconnection x - point is proportional to @xmath83 , where @xmath56 is the magnetic field strength in the inflow region .",
    "therefore , the spectral shape of the accelerated electrons should be sensitive to the magnetic field . here",
    ", the magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) is characterized by the plasma beta , i.e. , @xmath84 , with the choice of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as in  2 , @xmath56 is related to @xmath25 by @xmath87 in units of gauss . with @xmath47 , @xmath24=50 m , and @xmath49 , we simulated four cases with different @xmath25 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ f5 ] shows the energy spectra of the accelerated electrons in the four cases .",
    "as expected , it is seen that as @xmath25 decreases , i.e. , the magnetic field increases , more electrons are accelerated to high energies , and the spectrum at the high energy tail tends to become harder .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath76 on @xmath25 is plotted in the lower panel of figure [ f5 ] , which shows that as @xmath25 decreases , @xmath76 increases significantly , while @xmath2 increases when @xmath25 decreases from 0.1 to 0.01 and then decreases .",
    "the acceleration rate increases significantly from 0.169% to 15.2% as @xmath25 decreases from 0.1 to 0.005 .",
    "the resistivity in a reconnecting current sheet is caused by the local microscopic instability of plasma and it is still an unknown parameter in the flaring process . in our simulations",
    "the resistivity is characterized by the free parameter @xmath32 . with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 m ,",
    "five cases with different @xmath32 are simulated .",
    "note that @xmath91 corresponds to an anomalous magnetic diffusivity of @xmath92 @xmath93 m , @xmath94 times the classic value , which is quite similar to the numerical results of particle - in - cell simulations @xcite .",
    "such an anomalous magnetic diffusivity , in addition to the small normalization length scale , makes the magnetic reynolds number , i.e. , the inverse of @xmath32 , be @xmath95 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ f6 ] shows the corresponding energy spectra of the accelerated electrons .",
    "it is found that the acceleration rate slightly increases from 10.1% to 11.3% as @xmath32 increases from 0.005 to 0.02 and then slightly decreases to 9.70% as @xmath32 increases to 0.08 .",
    "the weak dependence of the acceleration rate is actually due to the population decrease of the electrons above @xmath96 kev and the population increase of the electrons between @xmath97 kev and @xmath96 kev as @xmath32 increases .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath76 on @xmath32 is depicted in the lower panel of figure [ f6 ] .",
    "it is seen that both @xmath2 and @xmath76 decreases with the increase of @xmath32 .",
    "x - ray and @xmath98-ray observations of solar flares indicated that electrons and protons are instantly accelerated in the magnetic reconnection process .",
    "analyses of hxr spectral data revealed that the accelerated electrons present a single power - law energy spectrum in most flares or a double power - law spectrum in some other events .",
    "the co - existence of normal and reverse type iii radio bursts strongly suggests that nonthermal electrons are accelerated near the reconnection x - point within a compact region less than 2000 km in length @xcite . near the reconnection x - point , both dc electric field and the reconnection - associated turbulence may contribute to the acceleration of these nonthermal electrons @xcite .",
    "the dc mechanism , as the simplest model , has been studied by various groups with help of test particle simulations .",
    "although the resulting energy spectrum of the accelerated electrons is somewhat power law - like , the spectral indices seem to be much smaller than the typical values derived from hxr observations . therefore , more work is required to fill the gap between test - particle simulations and observations .    using self - consistent electric and magnetic fields obtained from numerical simulations of 2.5-dimensional nonlinear mhd equations , we investigated the energy spectrum of the electrons that are accelerated by the dc electric field in a reconnecting current sheet .",
    "contrary to many of the previous studies , our test particle simulations indicate that the accelerated electrons present a power - law spectrum truncated by an exponential high energy tail , i.e. , @xmath99 , which is similar to the case of diffusive shock acceleration @xcite and the case of random dc - electric field acceleration when the electron trapping time is long @xcite .",
    "a parameter survey is conducted to investigate how various physical quantities affect the spectral profile and the acceleration rate .",
    "as the energy spectra are fitted with the function @xmath99 , it is found that    \\(1 ) @xmath76 , the rollover energy , increases with larger @xmath39 ( the guide magnetic field ) , larger @xmath24 ( which characterizes the size of the reconnection diffusion region ) , smaller @xmath25 ( the plasma beta ) , and smaller @xmath32 ( the resistivity ) ;    \\(2 ) @xmath2 increases with larger @xmath24 and smaller @xmath32 , and it saturates as @xmath24 is larger than 100 m or @xmath32 is very small .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath39 or @xmath25 is not monotonic .",
    "@xmath2 reaches the minimum when @xmath39 is @xmath100 times the antiparallel component of the reconnecting magnetic field , while @xmath2 reaches the maximum when @xmath25 is around 0.01 ;    \\(3 ) the acceleration rate , defined here as the percentage of the electrons that are accelerated above to 10 kev , increases with larger @xmath39 , larger @xmath24 , and smaller @xmath25 .",
    "it does not change much with @xmath32 , although the percentage of the electrons above 20 kev steadily decreases with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "the truncated power - law energy spectrum obtained in this paper is somewhat similar to the double power - law distribution , although the transition between the low and high energy tails is not so abrupt in most cases .",
    "the research in this paper reveals that , even with self - consistent electric and magnetic fields , we still can not reproduce the observed single or double power - law energy spectra of the nonthermal electrons in the framework of dc - electric field mechanism .",
    "this discrepancy between test particle simulations and observations might be reconciled if other effects are included .",
    "for example , the turbulence in the reconnection site would greatly enhance the collision rate between nonthermal electrons and background particles or waves @xcite .",
    "in other words , dc - electric field in the reconnection site alone may not be able to explain the observed spectral features of nonthermal electrons .",
    "the combination of dc - electric field and the turbulence may finally lead to single or double power - law spectral distributions , which were derived from hxr observations .",
