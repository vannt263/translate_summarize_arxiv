    "in @xcite , gray and hervella organized almost hermitian structures on even dimensional manifolds in 16 classes ; this was done in order to generalize khler geometry by requiring only the presence of an almost complex structure and of a compatible riemannian metric .",
    "the same approach was used by chinea and gonzlez in @xcite to classify almost contact metric structures , the odd - dimensional analogue of almost hermitian structures .",
    "the authors show how almost contact metric structures can be set apart in a certain number of classes . as in the gray - hervella paper",
    ", the authors of @xcite used the covariant derivative of the fundamental form of an almost contact metric stucture . in @xcite , instead , almost contact metric structures are classified using the nijenhuis tensor .    for us ,",
    "an almost contact metric structure on an odd - dimensional manifold @xmath0 , consisting of a @xmath1-form @xmath2 , a tensor @xmath3 , an adapted riemannian metric @xmath4 , and the associated khler form @xmath5 , is called _ cosymplectic _ if @xmath2 and @xmath5 are closed .",
    "a cosymplectic structure determines a poisson structure in a canonical way : every leaf of the foliation @xmath6 is endowed with a symplectic structure , given by the pullback of @xmath5 .",
    "cosymplectic structures were introduced by goldberg and yano in @xcite under the name of _ almost cosymplectic structures_. in fact , until very recently , the word cosymplectic indicated what we call here a cokhler structure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the terminology used in this paper was introduced in @xcite and seems to have been adopted since ( see @xcite ) .    while khler structures play a prominent role in even dimension ,",
    "it is not so clear which one , among almost contact metric structures , should be taken to be the odd dimensional analogue of khler structures .",
    "of all possible candidates , sasakian and cokhler structures seem to be the most natural .",
    "sasakian geometry has been a very active research area for quite a long time ; by now , the standard reference is @xcite .",
    "cokhler ( and , more generally , cosymplectic ) geometry has also drawn a great deal of interest in the last years ( see for instance @xcite ) . very recently",
    ", cosymplectic structures have appeared in a natural way in the study of @xmath7-symplectic ( or @xmath8-symplectic ) structures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a nice overview on cosymplectic geometry and its connection with other areas of mathematics ( specially geometric mechanics ) as well as with physics .",
    "in this paper we consider cosymplectic structures for which the reeb vector field is killing . in analogy with the terminology used in the contact metric setting , we call such structures _ k - cosymplectic_. every cokhler structure is k - cosymplectic , but we will give different examples of k - cosymplectic non cokhler structures .",
    "apart from cosymplectic structures , there is another possible meaning of cosymplectic , introduced by libermann in @xcite .",
    "a _ manifold _",
    "@xmath9 is _ cosymplectic _ if it is endowed with a 1-form @xmath2 and a 2-form @xmath5 , both closed , such that @xmath10 at every point of @xmath0 .",
    "the reeb field is uniquely determined by the conditions @xmath11 and @xmath12 . starting with this , we can define a cosymplectic manifold @xmath13 to be _ k - cosymplectic _ if there exists a riemannian metric @xmath4 on @xmath0 for which the reeb field is killing .",
    "roughly speaking , the difference between the two definitions of k - cosymplectic is that in the first case we fix a metric on @xmath0 , while in the second one we do not .",
    "this is akin to the difference between almost khler and symplectic geometry . despite this apparent discrepancy , proposition [ equivalence:1 ]",
    "shows that these definitions are equivalent .    in sections [ section : structure ] and [ section : deformations ] , for example",
    ", we deal with k - cosymplectic structures , whereas in sections [ section : forms ] , [ section : hamiltonianvf ] , [ section : hamiltoniangroupactions ] and [ section : closedreeborbits ] , we do not choose a metric ; we simply use the fact that our cosymplectic manifold admits some metric for which the reeb field is killing .",
    "the overall theme of this paper is to develop a theory of k - cosymplectic manifolds , motivated by the existing theory of k - contact manifolds .",
    "we introduce several useful concepts in analogy , such as a distinction between regular , quasi - regular and irregular structures , see section [ section : structure ] .",
    "there , we also prove a structure theorem for compact k - cosymplectic manifolds . in section [ section : forms ] we show that the de rham and the basic ( with respect to the characteristic foliation ) cohomology of a compact k - cosymplectic manifold contain the same information .",
    "section [ section : hamiltonianvf ] is devoted to cosymplectic and hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "these have already been introduced in @xcite , and used to prove a reduction result _  la marsden - weinstein _ for cosymplectic manifolds . in section [ section : deformations ]",
    "we introduce a generalization of the deformations of type i ( we briefly comment on type ii deformations in example [ ex : typeiideformation ] ) for general almost contact metric structures , and show that these deformations respect ( k-)cosymplectic and cokhler structures . on the one hand",
    "they can be used to show that any compact manifold with a k - cosymplectic structure admits a quasi- regular k - cosymplectic structure , see proposition [ prop : exquasireg ] ; on the other hand there are situations in which they can be used to deform k - cosymplectic structures in such a way that one has only finitely many closed reeb orbits .",
    "this is the topic of section [ section : closedreeborbits ] , in which we use equivariant cohomology to investigate the relation between closed reeb orbits and basic cohomology on a compact k - cosymplectic manifold , similar as it exists in the k - contact case @xcite : for a compact k - cosymplectic manifold with first betti number @xmath14 , the number of closed reeb orbits is either infinite or given by the total basic betti number of @xmath0 , see corollary [ cor : dimc ] .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof are morse - bott properties of the cosymplectic momentum map , as they are shown in section [ section : hamiltoniangroupactions ] .",

    ". then @xmath48 .",
    "we can therefore give an equivalent characterization of k - cosymplectic structures :    [ characterization ] a cosymplectic structure @xmath25 on a manifold @xmath0 is k - cosymplectic if and only if @xmath48 .",
