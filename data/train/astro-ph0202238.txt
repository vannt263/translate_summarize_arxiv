    "the nucleus of m87 ( ngc  4486 ) contains a black hole of mass @xmath8 directly determined from _ hst _ observations ( ford et al .",
    "1995 ; harms et al . 1995 ; macchetto et al .",
    "it is a nearby active nucleus with a one sided jet and large - scale radio structure .",
    "however , the activity displayed by its nucleus is far less than what is predicted if the central black hole were accreting mass from its hot interstellar medium ( with a standard radiative efficiency of @xmath9 per cent ; see e.g. fabian & rees 1995 ; reynolds et al .",
    "1996 ; di matteo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "m87 is probably the most illustrative case of a low - luminosity system otherwise common in nearby galaxies known to contain supermassive black holes ( e.g , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the low luminosities of nearby black holes : ( a ) the accretion occurs at extremely low rates or ( b ) the accretion occurs at low radiative efficiencies as predicted , for example , by advection dominated accretion flow models ( adafs ; e.g. rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994,1995 ; abramowicz et al .  1995 but see also inflow - outflow models ; e.g. blandford & begelmann 1999 ; stone et al .",
    "1999 ; or cdafs ; e.g. quataert & gruzinov 2002 ) . in order to discriminate between these two possibilities",
    ", it is necessary to determine both the accretion rates and the nuclear luminosities precisely .",
    "direct measurement of the latter and evaluation of the former has not been possible with previous x - ray satellites . here , we show that , for the nucleus of m87 , both can now be achieved with _",
    "the massive black holes at the center of elliptical galaxies are likely to accrete primarily from the surrounding hot , quasi - spherical ism .",
    "accretion rates can therefore be simply estimated using bondi accretion theory .",
    "this requires accurate measurements of both the density and temperature of the hot , x - ray emitting ism at the bondi accretion radius , the radius at which the gravitational potential of the central black hole begins to dominate the dynamics of the hot gas and the gas starts to fall into the black hole .    thanks to its high spatial resolution and sensitivity , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ is able to provide some of the most stringent constraints on the properties of low - luminosity black holes . in particular , at the distance of m87 ( 18 mpc ) , the spatial resolution of _ chandra _ corresponds to a radius of less than a hundred parsec or , equivalently , a few @xmath10 schwarzschild radii . for m87 , this allows us to measure , for the first time , fundamental properties of the ism _ at the accretion radius _ of the black hole , and thereby estimate the mass supply into the accretion flow .",
    "details of the chandra observations and observing strategy are presented by wilson & yang ( 2002 ) . in brief , m87 was observed twice with _",
    "chandra _ , on 2000 july 29 and 2000 july 30 .",
    "both observations were carried out using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) and back - illuminated s3 detector .",
    "the first observation was made in a full - frame mode with a 3.2 frame time .",
    "the net exposure time , after removing periods associated with small background flares , was 33.7ks .",
    "these data have been used to study the properties of the diffuse x - ray gas in m87 .",
    "the second , shorter observation was made in a reduced 1/8 sub - array mode with a frame time of 0.4s .",
    "the use of this mode avoids problems associated with pile - up in the data for the brightest knots of the jet and the central agn ( wilson & yang 2002 ) .",
    "the exposure time for the second observation was 12.8ks . high resolution _",
    "chandra _ images and detailed analyses of the jet and cluster properties are presented by wilson & yang ( 2002 ) and young , wilson & mundell ( 2002 ) , respectively .",
    "spectra were extracted from five circular annuli centered on the nucleus ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the data for the innermost region , which has a radius of 4 detector pixels ( approximately 2 arcsec or 0.2 kpc at the distance of the source ) , were extracted from the shorter 12.8 ks data set . the emission from this region is dominated by the central agn .",
    "the data for the four outer annuli ( covering radii of 0.2 - 1 , 1 - 4 , 4 - 8 and 8 - 12 kpc , respectively ) were extracted from the longer , full - frame observation .",
    "the spectra were grouped to contain a minimum of 20 counts per pulse invariant channel , allowing @xmath11 statistics to be used .",
    "background spectra were extracted from the blank - field data sets provided by the chandra x - ray center .",
    "separate photon - weighted response matrices and effective area files were constructed for each region using the appropriate acis - s calibration and response files .",
    "we have used the acisabs model in xspec to account for the time varying molecular contamination of the acis optical blocking filters .",
    "the spectra have been analyzed using the xspec code ( version 11.2.01 ; arnaud 1996 ) and following the deprojection method described by allen et al .",
    "we assume that the diffuse x - ray gas in each of the spherical shells , defined by the annuli mentioned above , is isothermal and can be described by a vmekal model ( kaastra & mewe 1993 ; incorporating the fe l calculations of liedhal , osterheld & goldstein 1995 ) with the abundances of o , mg , si , s and fe included as independent free fit parameters .",
    "the fit to the outermost annulus is used to determine the temperature , emission measure and abundances of the ism in the outermost spherical shell . the contribution from that shell to each inner annulus",
    "is then determined by purely geometric factors .",
    "the fit to the second annulus is used to determine the parameters for the second spherical shell , and so forth , working inwards . for the central 2 arcsec region",
    ", we have included an additional power - law component to model the emission from the agn ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic spectrum of the ism in this region is the same as in the next annulus out . the emission from all annuli",
    "is assumed to be absorbed by a column density , @xmath12 , of cold gas , which is a single , additional free parameter in the fits .",
    "the emission from the brightest knots of the jet and all other point sources were masked out and excluded from the analysis .",
    "the deprojected temperature profile of the x - ray gas , determined from a simultaneous fit to the five annular regions , is shown by the solid points in figure 2 .",
    "the deprojected temperature decreases from @xmath13 kev at @xmath14 kpc to @xmath15 kev within the central kpc ( @xmath16 errors ) .",
    "the total @xmath11 for the deprojected fit of 3171 for 1271 degrees of freedom indicates that the simple , spherically - symmetric model provides an incomplete description of the chandra data , which is unsurprising given the structural complexities evident in fig . 1",
    "( see also wilson & yang 2002 and young et al .",
    "nevertheless , the temperature measurements should provide a reasonable description of the mean , emission - weighted properties in each spherical shell ( although the uncertainties may be underestimated by a factor @xmath17 ) .",
    "we note that the temperature measurement for the @xmath18 kpc annulus is not affected significantly by flux from the central agn , scattered outwards in the wings of the point spread function . in order to test this",
    "we carried out simulations in xspec , using our deprojected model , in which we added a power - law component to the model for the first annulus out ( 0.2 - 1kpc ) , with a strength calculated according to the observed nuclear flux and psf models in the chandra handbook .",
    "we find that the flux in the wings of the psf has no significant effect on the best - fit parameters for the 0.2 - 1kpc annulus .",
    "to be conservative , we then doubled the strength in the wings and still found no significant change in the best - fit parameters , indicating that our results are robust against this effect .",
    "figure 2 also shows the importance of deprojecting the x - ray data when determining the central gas temperature ( and hence the density profile ) . without deprojection",
    ", we would infer a spuriously high temperature of @xmath19 kev for the @xmath20 kpc region , which would impinge on the calculations of the accretion rate in section 2.2 .",
    "note that deprojecting also improves the total @xmath11 for the fit by 410 compared with a direct analysis of the projected spectra , without including additional free parameters in the fit .    the electron density profile for the x - ray gas , shown in figure 2 , was derived by deprojecting the surface brightness profile , given the deprojected temperature profile . at radii larger than a few kpc",
    "the density profile follows @xmath21 . within the central @xmath17 kpc ,",
    "the density profile flattens : fitting a constant value to the central two annuli we obtain @xmath22 @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 @xmath23 for the innermost annulus ) .",
    "we can estimate the accretion rate from the ism onto the central black hole using bondi accretion theory ; the nuclear accretion rate will thus be determined by the density and temperature of the hot gas at the point where the influence of the black hole becomes dominant . in the standard adiabatic problem ( see appendix a with @xmath26 for the exact bondi results ) , the bondi ( accretion ) solution implies the sphere of influence of the black hole extends out to the gravitational capture radius ( see also e.g. ; di matteo et al . 1999 ; quataert & narayan 2000 ; nulsen & fabian 2000 ) : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the mass of the black hole ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 is the temperature in ( cf .",

    "@xmath41 is resolved by _",
    "equation 1 shows that the accretion radius of m87 ( for an assumed distance of 18 mpc ) corresponds to an angular scale of 2 arcsec .",
    "thus , using _",

    "we note that the mean absorbing column density measured across the central 12 kpc of @xmath54  is slightly lower than the nominal galactic value of @xmath55  determined from the hi studies of dickey & lockman ( 1990 )",
    ". this deficit may reflect residual systematic uncertainties in the effective area of the instrument at low energies .",
    "our results on the central agn are in averall agreement with those of wilson & yang ( 2002 ; although these authors find a higher absorbing column density for the nucleus than the jet knots ) .",

    "( note that our analysis differs from that of wilson & yang in that we account for the emission from diffuse x - ray gas viewed in projection against the nucleus . )",

    "a hot accretion flow around a supermassive black hole will radiate in the radio to x  ray bands . in the radio band , the emission results from synchrotron radiation . at higher energies , and up to the x - ray band",
    ", the emission is produced by bremsstrahlung processes and inverse compton scattering of the soft synchrotron photons ( e.g.  narayan , barret & mcclintock 1998 ) .    in this section ,",

    "the required accretion rates are always large enough for comptonization of the synchrotron emission to dominate the x - ray emission in these models ( where the scattering optical depth in an adaf is @xmath80 ; see e.g. , narayan et al .",
    "the exact positions of the comptonization bumps in the optical and x - ray bands are a function of temperature and , therefore , @xmath65 .",
    "models with higher values of electron heating , which are also preferred from a theoretical point of view , agree better with the measured 210 kev spectral slope of @xmath81 .",
    "note that , as shown in figure 3 , the agreement with the observed spectrum is obtained only if the compton bumps are pronounced , i.e. the agreement depends upon the details of the model .    marshall et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and wilson & yang ( 2002 ) have shown that the spectrum of the innermost jet knots observed by _",
    "are consistent with that of the nucleus , possibly implying a similar origin .",
    "it is indeed plausible that a large fraction of the observed nuclear x - ray flux might be due to emission from the base of the jet .",
    "the point of figure  3 is to show that adaf models are consistent with the requirement of a low - radiative efficiency .",
    "in fact , figure 3 shows that it is possible for the accretion flow to account for a large fraction of the observed nuclear emission , thereby offering an alternative explanation .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of the nucleus of m87 have resolved the properties of the ism all the way into the bondi radius of the central black hole .",
    "this makes m87 the only extragalactic black hole system in which both the gas temperature and density are measured into approximately the accretion region , and for which a bondi accretion rate can be directly calculated ( see narayan 2002 or quataert 2002 for similar study of sgr a@xmath82 ) .",
    "m87 also possesses a relatively bright nuclear source , the flux of which can be accurately measured in the x - ray band with _",
    "chandra _ , and throughout the whole of the spectral energy distribution with other observations .",
    "at present , m87 is the best constrained low - luminosity extragalactic black hole system .",
    "with both @xmath83 and @xmath25 measured , we were able to show unambiguously that the black hole in m87 is highly underluminous with respect to its bondi mass supply : the expected power output exceeds , by about 4 orders of magnitude , the observed value . if the black hole in m87 is indeed accreting close to its bondi rate ( cf . , ",
    "5.1 ) , the accretion efficiency , @xmath84 , must be low .",
    "we have shown that the required values of @xmath84 are consistent with predictions from adaf models .",
    "we note that our general result is independent of whether the observed nuclear luminosity is attributed to an adaf or entirely dominated by jet emission ( see e.g. wilson & yang 2002 ; marshall et al .",
    "the constraints derived here show that it is possible for a significant fraction of the observed nuclear emission to be contributed by the accretion flow .",
    "more importantly , perhaps , the requirement for low - radiative efficiency of the accreting gas can only be invalidated if the actual mass accreted by the black hole were to be a very small fraction of the mass supplied in the outer region of the flow ( i.e. of @xmath85 ) .",
    "this could be the case if strong outflows or perhaps convection are important in the accretion flow , as has been discussed by e.g. blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) , stone et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and quataert & gruzinov ( 2000 ) , narayan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , respectively ( but see balbus & hawley s [ 2002 ] discussion on convection ) . in such models ,",
    "the accretion flow would produce a much lower luminosity than a pure inflow adaf and make a negligible contribution to the observed luminosity ( which , in the case of m87 , can be easily explained by the jet emission . in the cdaf case",
    ", the energy would probably need to be tapped from the black hole s spin in order to explain the high jet power ) .",
    "the bondi rate could also be decreased if the jet heats the ism .",
    "we discuss this further in  5.1 .    in a previous study using radio observations , di matteo et al .",
    "( 1999 ; 2000 ) favored outflow models for the nuclei of ellipticals . with _",
    "chandra _ , the properties of the central regions of the ism gas have been determined more accurately for a number of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , loewenstein et al .",
    "in particular , the new observations have shown that the ism density profiles tend to flatten off significantly in the central regions of ellipticals ( as is the case in m87 - figure 2 ) , implying bondi accretion rates smaller than was previously estimated . in most cases , _ chandra _ does not detect nuclear point sources ( loewenstein et al .",
    "given that their black hole masses are more uncertain , the constraints for these other low luminosity systems remain inconclusive .",
    "the only two _ chandra _ detections of x - ray nuclear sources in low luminosity elliptical nuclei are in m87 and ngc 6166 ( di matteo et al .",
    "2001 ) . for both of these nuclei ,",
    "pure inflow adaf models are consistent with the observational constraints and can explain large fractions of the observed nuclear fluxes .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of sgr a@xmath86 have also measured the x - ray flux of the nuclear point source ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ) and allowed us to estimate accretion rates onto the central black hole ( e.g. narayan 2002 ; quataert 2002 ) .",
    "sgr a@xmath86 , like the elliptical nuclei , also requires low radiative efficiency for the accreting gas and is consistent with adaf models .",
    "further constraints on adaf and inflow / outflow models in the case of ellipticals will require knowledge of the contributions , over all wavelengths , of emission from the bases of the jets .",
    "our fundamental conclusions rely on the assumption that the black hole in m87 is accreting mass at the bondi rate .",
    "the predicted nuclear power of m87 , for accretion at the bondi rate , and @xmath88 is @xmath89 5 @xmath90 @xmath91 ( see eq .  4 ) .",
    "this estimate roughly matches some estimates of the kinetic power in the jet which is calculated to be @xmath92 ( e.g. ; bicknell & begelman 1999 ; owen et al .",
    "2000 ; whereas reynolds et al .",
    "1996 obtain @xmath93 ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the jet power required to evacuate , at the sound speed , the inner cavities in the icm associated with the inner radio lobes ( @xmath94 ) in m87 implies @xmath95 ( young et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this value is smaller than the estimates of bicknell & begelman ( 1999 ) and owen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) but only considers the cavities observed in the inner region of m87 .",
    "further , @xmath96 would be higher if the cavities are evacuated supersonically .",
    "we find , therefore , that the bondi luminosity estimate roughly matches the overall energetics of the black hole in m87 ( if this is indeed @xmath97 )",
    ". this may provide support for the relevance of bondi theory as a means of estimating the mass supply and the nuclear power of black holes in ellipticals .",
    "we note that the jet in m87 is also a low - efficiency radiator with a total bolometric luminosity of the order of @xmath98 ( owen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus , based on these estimates of the power of the nucleus , the energy input if all the @xmath99 reaches the black hole , at present dominates radiative losses from both the jet and accretion flow .",
    "we discuss two alternative possibilities to the low - radiative efficiency scenario : ( a ) as mentioned above , blandford & begelman ( see also e.g. stone et al .",
    "1999 ) have suggested that low luminosity accretion flows may develop strong outflows such that most of the mass and energy is removed from the accretion flows . in this case",
    "one may speculate that the accretion energy is emerging in the jet ( it has been shown that the inner kiloparsec of m87 is highly magnetized and turbulent , e.g. owen , eilek & keel 1990 ; zhou 1998 .",
    "outflows may become collimated and radiate more efficiently when interacting with this medium ) . on the same note , livio , ogilvie & pringle ( 1999 )",
    "have argued that the energy extraction from black holes via mhd processes such as the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) may in - fact be most efficient for advection dominated flows ( see also meier 2001 ) .",
    "\\(b ) the central engine of m87 undergoes on - off activity cycles ( e.g. , binney 1999 ; owen et al .",
    "the black hole in m87 may have been active for 100 - 200 myr ( as derived from estimates of the current age of its radio halos ; owen et al .",
    "as long as the black hole is fed ( e.g. at the estimated bondi rate ) it will have a strong effect on the ism gas in the core ( the bolometric x - ray luminosity of which is @xmath100 in the inner 20 kpc or so ; e.g. nulsen & bhringer 1995 ) .",
    "the jet will disturb ( or heat ) the core regions , support bulk flows and turbulence .",
    "these extra pressure forces may , in turn , offset radiative cooling , support the gas against gravitational infall and suppress accretion onto the black hole ( hence the jet activity itself ) .",
    "once the central engine turns off , no energy is deposited in the core so that accretion at the standard bondi rate and then jet activity resume .    the significant flattening of the x - ray gas density profile within the central @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "2 ) may be a strong indication that indeed energy is being deposited in the central region of m87 ( see also loewestein et al .",
    "2001 for other virgo ellipticals ) .",
    "a flat density profile can only arise if there is lots of mass dropout ( see e.g. ; quatert & narayan 2000 ) or maybe if gas is not flowing inward at all . given that mass dropout is not seen in x - ray data at larger radii ( behringer et al .",
    "2002 ; molendi & pizzolati 2001 ) it is possible that something has affected the accretion radius and stifled accretion .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mild peak in the figure 2 density profile coincides with the ring at about 10 arcsec from the nucleus ( figure 1 ) which is also where the h-@xmath64 emission peaks .",
    "this possibly indicates that there could be stifled inflow within this radius and a cooling flow outside it .",
    "it is also notable that the few @xmath102 radius corresponds approximately to the size of the inner radio lobes of m87 ( owen et al .",
    "there is also strong evidence of ` cavities ' in the x - ray emitting gas of m87 , the inner ones of which coincide with the inner radio lobes ( young et al .",
    "2002 ; see also fig .  1 ) and a number of other clusters containing radio galaxies ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ;",
    "fabian et al . 2000 ; heinz et al . 2002 ) ; some of these cavities are associated with observed radio lobes and others are hypothesized to be relics of old radio activity .",
    "it has been shown that bondi accretion can be significantly suppressed in a non - adiabatic gas ( e.g. ostriker et al . 1976 ) . following along these lines ,",
    "we show that , at present , the energy dumped into the ism by the jet in m87 may be sufficient to decrease the accretion rate with respect to the bondi value by a factor @xmath103 .",
    "we do not attempt to build a detailed model but just qualitatively discuss the implications of non - adiabatic bondi accretion for m87 .",
    "we consider a jet of power @xmath104 and velocity @xmath105 advancing into the ism with density @xmath106",
    ". the jet forces its way outwards at a speed @xmath107 which is obtained by balancing the outward momentum flux of the jet with the pressure of the ism .",
    "as long as @xmath107 is larger than the sound speed @xmath108 in the ism , the thermal pressure will be dominated by the contribution @xmath109 from ram pressure .",
    "hence @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath107 no longer exceeds @xmath108 , the jet will slow down and dump energy in the surrounding medium .",
    "the inner radio lobes ( in the inner few kpc ) in m87 may be associated with such a region .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of m87 ( young et al .",
    "2002 ) and other radio galaxies in clusters show no evidence that such interactions lead to sharp bow - shock regions . more often , it seems that jets are responsible for inflating bubbles in the surrounding ism which then expand buoyantly ( i.e. roughly at the sound speed ; e.g. churazov et al . 2001 ; reynolds , heinz & begelman 2002 ) and give rise to radio lobes and corresponding x - ray structures .",

    "2002 )    taking the mass , momentum and adding the energy conservation equation to the standard bondi problem one can solve for the accretion radius ( see details in appendix a ) with the addition of an energy ( heat ) source . in this case",
    "the accretion radius is reduced to :    @xmath112    where the heating is in units of @xmath113 and the first term in equation 5 is the standard bondi radius as in equation 1 . according to the considerations above we write the energy deposited by the jet as : @xmath114 ( where m is the total gas mass ) with @xmath115 so that @xmath116 . in this problem",
    "we take heating ( i.e. , the energy deposition ) to be occurring around the accretion radius of the black hole ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the inner radio lobes and x - ray cavities both on kpc scale may be indications that this is not too bad an approximation ( although these are at radii which are more than an order of magnitude larger than the accretion radius ) .",
    "the resulting accretion radius will rescale from the classical bondi value roughly as , @xmath117 where we have assumed that @xmath118 , the velocity of the bubble inflated by the jet in the ism .",
    "equation 6 clearly shows that the if bulk motions ( as well as heat ) at speeds @xmath119 are created by the jet , then the accretion rate is affected .",
    "the flow velocity of the m87 jet on scales of a few hundred parsec is highly relativistic ( biretta , zhou & owen 1995 ) .",
    "thus , according to the above scaling the accretion radius of m87 is likely to be reduced by a factor @xmath120 .",
    "this would imply a decrease in mass accretion rate by @xmath121 .",
    "this is more than enough to relax the requirement for low - radiative efficiency of the accreting gas .",
    "this may also provide support for the idea that the engine of m87 may undergo cycles of activity and at present the black hole is accreting at rates much lower than the bondi rate .",
    "however , the transit time from the nucleus to the knot a in the jet ( at a distance of @xmath122 kpc ) is only about @xmath123 yrs .",
    "this implies that for the accretion rate to be low now , the last active phase must have been a `` burst - like '' event of strong accretion on a relatively short timescale .",
