    "the jets are measured down to a transverse momentum of @xmath66  g , which extends the region explored in  @xcite to significantly smaller values .",
    "whereas the @xmath64  always originates from a charm or anticharm quark produced in the hard subprocess , the non-@xmath64-tagged jet can result from either the other heavy quark ( fig .  [ fig : processes]a , b , d ) or a light parton ( e.g.  a gluon , fig .",
