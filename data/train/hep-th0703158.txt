    "recently a new geometry in the casimir effect@xcite , a piston geometry , has been introduced in a @xmath0 dirichlet model @xcite . generally the piston is located in a semi - infinite cylinder closed at its head .",
    "the piston is perpendicular to the walls of the cylinder and can move freely inside it .",
    "the cross sections of the piston and cylinder coincide .",
    "physically this means that the approximation is valid when the distance between the piston and the walls of a cylinder is small in comparison with the piston size .    in paper @xcite a perfectly conducting square piston at zero temperature was investigated in @xmath1 model in the electromagnetic and scalar case . the exact formula ( eq.(6 ) in @xcite ) for the force on a square piston was written in the electromagnetic case .",
    "also the limit of short distances was found for arbitrary cross sections at zero temperature ( eq.(7 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "a dilute circular piston and cylinder were studied perturbatively in @xcite . in this case",
    "the force on two plates inside a cylinder and the force in a piston geometry differ essentially .",
    "the force in a piston geometry can even change sign in this approximation for thin enough walls of the material .",
    "other examples of pistons in a scalar case were presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a @xmath1 model in the electromagnetic case with physically realistic perfectly conducting boundary conditions .",
    "two identical plates move freely inside an infinite cylinder with the same cross section , which is arbitrary .",
    "the plates are perpendicular to the walls of the cylinder . in section",
    "@xmath2 we derive the new exact zero temperature result ( [ r7 ] ) , ( [ p10 ] ) for the casimir energy of two identical parallel plates inside a cylinder with an arbitrary cross section by making use of the zeta function technique @xcite .",
    "two special cases of ( [ p10 ] ) , the exact results for rectangular and circular cylinders , are briefly discussed .",
    "also we discuss the important property of the result ( [ p10 ] ) - its exponential damping at long distances ( [ om1 ] ) . in section @xmath3 the new exact result ( [ r21 ] ) for the free energy of two identical parallel plates inside an infinite cylinder is derived . in the long distance",
    "limit the new high temperature result ( [ r24 ] ) for the free energy is obtained . in section",
    "@xmath4 the heat kernel technique @xcite is applied to derive the leading short distance behaviour of the free energy .",
    "also we prove that in the short distance limit of the high temperature result ( [ r24 ] ) the known high temperature result for two infinite perfectly conducting parallel plates ( [ om2 ] ) is obtained .",
    "we take @xmath5 .",
    "our aim is to calculate the casimir energy of interaction and the force between the two identical parallel plates of an arbitrary cross section inside an infinite cylinder of the same cross section ( the plates are perpendicular to the walls of the cylinder ) .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 eigenfrequencies of the perfectly conducting cylindrical resonator with an arbitrary cross section @xmath8 can be written as follows . for @xmath6 modes ( @xmath9 ) inside the perfectly conducting cylindrical resonator @xmath10\\times m$ ] with @xmath11 being a normal to the boundary @xmath12 of an arbitrary cross section @xmath8 the magnetic field @xmath13 and eigenfrequencies @xmath14 are determined by : @xmath15 the other components of the magnetic and electric fields can be expressed via @xmath13 .    for the @xmath7 modes ( @xmath16 ) inside the same perfectly conducting cylindrical resonator",
    "the electric field @xmath17 and eigenfrequencies @xmath18 are determined by : @xmath19    in zeta function regularization scheme the casimir energy is defined as follows : @xmath20 where the sum has to be calculated for large positive values of @xmath21 and after that an analytical continuation to the value @xmath22 is performed .    alternatively one can define the casimir energy via a zero temperature one loop effective action @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is a time interval here ) : @xmath25 after integration over @xmath26 in ( [ a1 ] ) one can see that definitions ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) coincide .    in every casimir sum it is convenient to write : @xmath27 for the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ a4 ] ) we use the property of the theta function @xmath28 : @xmath29 and the value of the integral @xmath30 for nonzero values of @xmath11 to rewrite the neumann zeta function @xmath31 ( arising from te modes ) in the form : @xmath32 -   \\\\ - \\sum_{\\lambda_{in}}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\:\\gamma\\bigl((s-1)/2\\bigr)}{4 a \\gamma(s/2 ) } \\bigl(\\frac{a \\lambda_{in}}{\\pi}\\bigr)^{1-s } \\label{a5}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the neumann part of the casimir energy is given by : @xmath33 here we used @xmath34 .",
    "the dirichlet part of the casimir energy ( from tm modes ) is obtained by analogy : @xmath35    the electromagnetic casimir energy of a perfectly conducting resonator of the length @xmath36 and an arbitrary cross section is given by the sum of ( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) : @xmath37    the terms @xmath38 yield the electromagnetic casimir energy for a unit length of a perfectly conducting infinite cylinder with the same cross section @xmath8 as the resonator under consideration .    for rectangular boxes it was generally believed @xcite that the repulsive contribution to the force acting on two parallel opposite sides of a _ single _ box ( and resulting here from ( [ a10]-[a11 ] ) ) could be measured in experiment .",
    "however , the terms ( [ a10]-[a11 ] ) are closely related to the casimir energy of an infinite in @xmath39 direction cylinder when there are no plates inside ( see eq.([om8 ] ) ) .",
    "imagine that the box is large in @xmath39 direction .",
    "its casimir energy and the casimir energy of an infinite in @xmath39 direction cylinder coincide when the two opposite @xmath39 sides of the box are located at spatial infinity . to calculate the energy change between these two configurations and the force on a @xmath39 side of the box one should subtract the energy of an infinite cylinder from the expression for @xmath40 ( [ a8]-[a12 ] ) when the box sides are infinitely far from each other .",
    "then the force on a @xmath39 side of the box is equal to zero for infinite distance @xmath36 between box @xmath39 sides .    for the experimental check of the casimir energy one should measure the force somehow .",
    "one can insert two parallel perfectly conducting plates inside an infinite perfectly conducting cylinder and measure the force acting on one of the plates as it is being moved through the cylinder .",
    "the distance between the inserted plates is @xmath36 .        to calculate the force on each of the two plates inside a cylinder with the cross section",
    "@xmath8 one can perform the following gedanken experiment that was frequently used to calculate the casimir force between two infinite parallel perfectly conducting plates .",
    "imagine that @xmath4 parallel plates are inserted inside an infinite cylinder and then @xmath2 exterior plates are moved to spatial infinity .",
    "this situation is exactly equivalent to @xmath3 perfectly conducting cavities touching each other . from the energy of this system",
    "one has to subtract the casimir energy of an infinite cylinder without plates inside it , only then do we obtain the energy of interaction between the interior parallel plates , the one that can be measured in the experiment . doing so we obtain the attractive force on each interior plate inside the cylinder : @xmath41 the sum here is over all @xmath6 and @xmath7 eigenfrequencies @xmath42 for a cylinder with the cross section @xmath8 and an infinite length .",
    "in fact , the final results for this geometry should coincide with the results for the three plates piston geometry when one of the three piston plates ( the exterior plate ) is moved to infinity . also one can immediately obtain the result for three plates system inside a cylinder , which is exactly the piston geometry , employing the same arguments and renormalization scheme .",
    "in the three plates system the force on the interior plate is equal to the sum of the forces acting on this plate from the two exterior plates , i.e. the piston geometry can be effectively considered as @xmath2 two plates systems . it should be emphasized that these assertions are valid for perfect boundary conditions .    by making use of an identity @xcite @xmath43",
    "one can rewrite ( [ r7 ] ) in the form : @xmath44    the results ( [ r7 ] ) , ( [ p10 ] ) are our main zero temperature results .",
    "our results are _",
    "exact for an arbitrary curved geometry of a cylinder_. this fact may be important for the experimental check of the casimir effect in piston related geometries with curved boundaries .",
    "one can choose an arbitrary curved plate geometry @xmath8 , for this geometry the eigenvalues of the two dimensional dirichlet and neumann problems @xmath45 , @xmath46 can be found numerically .",
    "after that the exact expressions ( [ r7 ] ) , ( [ p10 ] ) can be used to obtain the casimir force on a plate .",
    "in fact , similar in the form mathematical results can be obtained in the case of a one dimensional massive scalar field theory on a manifold with boundary , however , in our case an infinite number of `` masses '' @xmath45 , @xmath46 appear in the theory due to existence of the cylinder cross section .    for convenience of the reader",
    "we write explicitly two special cases : rectangular and circular cylinders . for a rectangular cylinder with the sides @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 the exact casimir energy of two plates inside it can be written as : @xmath49 the prime means that the term @xmath50 is omitted in the sum .    for a circular cylinder",
    "the eigenvalues of the two dimensional laplace operator @xmath51 are determined by the roots of bessel functions and derivatives of bessel functions .",
    "the exact casimir energy of two circular plates of the radius @xmath47 separated by a distance @xmath36 inside an infinite circular cylinder of the radius @xmath47 is given by : @xmath52 the sum is over positive @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the leading asymptotic behaviour of @xmath55 for long distances @xmath56",
    ", @xmath57 is determined by the lowest positive eigenvalues of the two dimensional dirichlet and neumann problems @xmath58 : @xmath59 so the casimir force between the two plates in a cylinder is exponentially small for long distances .",
    "this important property of the solution is due to the gap in the frequency spectrum or , in other words , it is due to the finite size of the cross section of the cylinder .",
    "to get the free energy @xmath60 for bosons at nonzero temperatures ( @xmath61 ) one has to make the substitutions : @xmath62 thus the free energy describing the interaction of the two parallel perfectly conducting plates inside an infinite perfectly conducting cylinder of an arbitrary cross section has the form : @xmath63 this is our central finite temperature result .",
    "note that @xmath64 . for rectangular and circular cylinders one can substitute the explicitly known @xmath45 , @xmath46 to ( [ r21 ] ) in analogy to ( [ p11 ] ) and ( [ p12 ] ) .",
    "the attractive force between the plates inside an infinite cylinder of the same cross section at nonzero temperatures is given by : @xmath65 here @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in the long distance limit @xmath68 one has to keep only @xmath69 term in @xmath70 .",
    "thus the free energy of the plates inside a cylinder in the _ high temperature limit _ is equal to : @xmath71 one can check that the limit @xmath72 , @xmath73 in ( [ r24 ] ) immediately yields the known high temperature result for two parallel perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance @xmath36 ( see eq.([om2 ] ) for details ) .    if the conditions @xmath56 , @xmath57 are satisfied in addition to the condition @xmath68 then the leading asymptotic behaviour of the free energy can be expressed via the lowest positive eigenvalues of the two dimensional dirichlet and neumann problems @xmath74 and @xmath75 as follows : @xmath76 so the force between the two plates in a cylinder is exponentially small for large enough distances between them at finite temperatures as well .",
    "it is convenient to apply the technique of the heat kernel and zeta function to obtain the short distance behaviour of the free energy ( [ r21 ] ) .",
    "it can be done by noting that if the heat kernel expansion @xmath77 exists ( @xmath78 is a dimension of the riemannian manifold ) then one can write the expansion @xmath79 by making use of the analytical structure of the zeta function .    the proof can be done as follows .",
    "zeta function can be written in two different forms : @xmath80 it is well known that residues at the poles of the zeta function are related to the coefficients @xmath81 of the heat kernel expansion ( [ om5 ] ) : @xmath82 which follows from ( [ p20 ] ) and ( [ om5 ] ) .",
    "the expansion ( [ r22 ] ) now follows from ( [ p21 ] ) and ( [ p22 ] ) .",
    "the free energy ( [ r21 ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath83 here the eigenvalues @xmath84 satisfy the equation @xmath85 and @xmath86 satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundary of the manifold @xmath87\\times m $ ] , the eigenvalues @xmath88 satisfy the equation @xmath89 and @xmath90 satisfy neumann boundary conditions at the boundary of the manifold @xmath87\\times m $ ] , @xmath8 is an arbitrary cross section of the cylinder .",
    "here we sum over all nonzero eigenvalues @xmath88 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath91 satisfy the one dimensional laplace equation with neumann boundary conditions at the boundary of the manifold @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "they appear due to the condition @xmath64 in equation ( [ r21 ] ) and our decision to sum over all nonzero @xmath88 in ( [ om4 ] ) .",
    "thus in the last line of ( [ om4 ] ) the eigenvalues @xmath88 corresponding to the eigenfunctions @xmath92 ( for which @xmath93 ) are effectively subtracted .",
    "our strategy is the following : one expands the logarithms in the formula ( [ om4 ] ) in series @xmath94 applies the expansion ( [ r22 ] ) to each term in ( [ om7 ] ) for short distances @xmath36 and performs the sum over @xmath11 thus getting riemann zeta function at integer positive values .",
    "it is possible to obtain the coefficients of the heat kernel expansion for the operators @xmath95 along the following lines .",
    "for the manifold @xmath87\\times m $ ] and dirichlet boundary conditions one can write : @xmath96 here @xmath97 is an area and @xmath98 is a perimeter of the cross section @xmath8 , @xmath99 is the interior angle of each sharp corner at the boundary @xmath12 and @xmath100 is the curvature of each boundary smooth section described by the curve @xmath101 .",
    "thus the important for our purpose seeley coefficients for the operator @xmath95 with dirichlet boundary conditions imposed at the boundary of the manifold @xmath87\\times m $ ] can be obtained from ( [ om6 ] ) as the coefficients at specific powers of @xmath102 in the expansion ( [ om5 ] ) : @xmath103    one can check by a direct calculation that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 for manifold @xmath87\\times m $ ] with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the other needed coefficients for manifold @xmath8 can also be read off from ( [ om6 ] ) : @xmath107 , for manifold @xmath87 $ ] : @xmath108 .    for @xmath109 and @xmath72 ,",
    "@xmath73 one obtains from ( [ r22 ] ) and ( [ om4 ] ) the leading terms for the free energy : @xmath110 where @xmath111 the force calculated from ( [ r23 ] ) coincides with the zero temperature force @xmath112 in @xcite , ( eq.7 ) .",
    "thus we prove that in the finite temperature case the leading short distance terms are the same as in the zero temperature case .    in the limit @xmath72",
    ", @xmath113 one immediately obtains from ( [ r24 ] ) the high temperature result for two parallel perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance @xmath36 .",
    "one expands logarithms in series and uses ( [ r22 ] ) and @xmath114 in two dimensions ( @xmath115 ) to obtain : @xmath116 which is a well known result @xcite .",
