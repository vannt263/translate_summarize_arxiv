    "euclidean quantum gravity in four dimensions is formally defined by the path integral @xmath1 } \\ .\\ ] ] the einstein - hilbert action @xmath2 $ ] is a function of the 4-geometry @xmath3 , @xmath2 = -l_p^{-2 } r[g ] + \\lambda v[g]$ ] .",
    "the planck length @xmath4 determines the gravitational coupling constant for the total curvature @xmath5 $ ] and the total 4-volume @xmath6 $ ] enters the action if the cosmological constant @xmath7 is non - zero .    in order to _ define _ the integral  ( [ z1 ] )",
    ", we consider a lattice approximation , so that the path - integral becomes the limit of a series of well - defined and finite integrals .",
    "a direct route for such an approximation is provided by the regge calculus  @xcite , which is suitable for simulations  @xcite .",
    "one considers a simplicial lattice of fixed connectivity , which subdivides a 4-manifold of given topology in @xmath8 4-simplices , @xmath9 tetraeder , @xmath10 triangles , @xmath11 links and @xmath12 vertices .",
    "as we assign a length to each link , a 4-geometry is defined in the euclidean sector , if the triangle inequalities are fulfilled for every ( sub-)simplex . in the following we will use the squared lengths @xmath13 associated with each link @xmath14 as the basic variables and a given set of such variables defines a 4-geometry @xmath15 $ ] for a given simplicial lattice .",
    "variation of the variables @xmath13 allows us to approximate the path integral ( [ z1 ] ) .",
    "one can calculate the regge action @xmath16 = \\sum_t a_t \\delta_t$ ] as a sum over all triangles @xmath17 with area @xmath18 multiplied by their associated deficit angles @xmath19 .",
    "the 4-volume is calculated as a sum over the volume of all 4-simplices @xmath20 , @xmath21 = \\sum_s v_s$ ] .",
    "we then approximate the gravitational action by @xmath22 = -l_p^{-2 } r[q ] +   \\lambda v[q]$ ] .",
    "it has been demonstrated how the geometrical variables of the regge calculus converge towards the corresponding variables of general relativity in the classical continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "it requires an upper bound on the link lengths , @xmath23 , and a limit @xmath24 on the fatness @xmath25 of each 4-simplex , @xmath26 .",
    "the continuum limit is then reached for @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( cheeger et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to replace the path integral ( [ z1 ] ) by a finite integral on the simplicial lattice , @xmath30 } .\\ ] ] we need to define the integration measure .",
    "a simple choice is the uniform measure @xmath31\\ ] ] where the function @xmath32 equals @xmath33 when all triangle inequalities are fulfilled and @xmath26 for all 4-simplices ; it is @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "the integration limit @xmath35 is necessary for a well - defined integral , but it has no physical meaning in itself . indeed ,",
    "simple re - scaling @xmath36 formally removes it and leads to the integral @xmath37   e^ { \\beta r[q ] - \\lambda v[q ] } \\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in previous numerical investigations  @xcite the upper limit @xmath35 was infinite which corresponds to the limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the integral ( [ z4 ] ) .",
    "in the following we will numerically evaluate the integral ( [ z4 ] ) in order to determine the phase structure by varying the coupling parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "our results suggest a physically interesting continuum limit for finite values of the coupling parameters .",
    "the numerical computations have been performed for the integral @xmath44    e^ { \\beta r[q ] - \\lambda v[q ] } \\ ] ] with @xmath45 instead of ( [ z4 ] ) with @xmath46 .",
    "this means that the coupling constants and expectation values need to be adjusted accordingly , e.g. @xmath47 , @xmath48 etc .",
    "we set @xmath49 but our results seem to be independent of the specifc value for a relatively wide range @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "we used a hypercubic regular triangulation of the 4-torus  @xcite , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 vertices .    from simulations with @xmath54 and varying @xmath42 we find expectation values @xmath55 , which are ( almost ) zero for @xmath56 values ; @xmath57 initially decreases for increasing @xmath43",
    "then , as depicted in figure  [ fig_1b ] , we find that @xmath57 increases for @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , the transition from @xmath59 to @xmath60 is no longer defined clearly , because we have to deal with a significant hysteresis for large @xmath43 .",
    "the line @xmath56 is depicted in figure  [ fig_2 ] for different lattice size .",
    "the curve @xmath56 is interesting , since a vanishing curvature is a desired ingredient for a physical continuum limit .",
    "as we approach the turning point @xmath61 from smaller @xmath43 , the suszeptibility @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , increases significantly ; this increase is more pronounced for larger lattice size as depicted in figure  [ fig_3a ] .",
    "next , we performed calculations varying @xmath43 at @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the lattice size @xmath66 . as expected , we find that the curvature @xmath55 increases initially , exhibiting a transition from negative to positive values , but when @xmath43 increases further a second transition back to negative values is seen .",
    "we depict @xmath67 , measuring curvature fluctuations , in figure  [ fig_3b ] ; for @xmath64 one can distinguish two peaks corresponding to the two transitions .",
    "these peaks merge into one at @xmath68 .",
    "we also measured the 2-point correlation function @xmath69 along the elongated direction on the @xmath66 lattice for @xmath56 and found that the function @xmath70 is significantly different from zero for @xmath71 .",
    "negative values alternate with positive values , which indicates a non - trivial interaction .",
    "the correlations increase for @xmath72 .",
    "although we are not able to provide a complete finite size scaling analysis , our data suggest the following : in the region @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , one deals with a strong phase transition , which is likely of first order . in the region",
    "@xmath75 we are currently unable to distinguish between a cross - over transition or a higher - order phase transition .",
    "however the end - point @xmath76 itself is a natural candidate for a second - order phase transition .",
    "the increase of susceptiblity @xmath77 and the link correlations @xmath70 approaching @xmath76 from smaller values confirm this picture .",
    "our simulations differ from those of the previous literature by introducing the limit @xmath35 in the functional integral  ( [ z3 ] ) .",
    "while a simple re - scaling removes @xmath35 formally from the partition function  ( [ z4 ] ) , our model remains more general than those simulated in the literature , which are recovered in our limit of large @xmath43 .",
    "remarkably , the new model appears to have a second order fixed point in the @xmath78 plane , which deserves further study .",
