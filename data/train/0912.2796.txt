    "inflation  @xcite nowadays is accepted as the standard paradigm to solve many cosmological problems , and to provide the appropriate initial conditions for the hot big bang cosmology .",
    "one of the strongest supports of this early era of inflation is the observed primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 , whose power spectrum @xmath1 is nearly scale invariant with its index being @xmath2 , with almost perfect gaussian statistics  @xcite .",
    "conversely , these observations have been acting as a powerful discriminator among the models of inflation based on particle physics  @xcite and placing strong constraints on the realization of inflation , e.g. in the context of supergravity  @xcite . in the next few years , we will obtain more precise data on the primordial density perturbations by ongoing and forthcoming experiments like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and the planck satellites , and thus will be able to constrain the models of inflation even stronger than now .    in the light of these upcoming observations ,",
    "there have been increasing interests in the non - gaussian signature of the primordial perturbations .",
    "currently , the non - gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations is constrained to be @xmath3  @xcite , with @xmath4 being the non - linear parameter  @xcite , which translates into less than 0.1% of non - gaussian contribution .",
    "the sensitivity is expected to be improved at the level of @xmath5 on the cmb scales @xcite , and indeed primordial non - gaussianity will be another powerful probe of inflation : if substantial non - gaussianity were to be detected , we should look for new models beyond the simplest single field slow - roll inflation models , where @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "a short list of the models where large non - gaussianity may arise includes dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation  @xcite , single field inflation with features  @xcite , multi - field inflation  @xcite , curvaton  @xcite , and so on .    in this note , we study a new possibility of generating large amount of highly non - gaussian curvature perturbation : we consider a period of inflation supported by a non - zero vacuum energy .",
    "this is in fact the original model of inflation  @xcite and has received a renewed interest in the context of vast string landscape  @xcite . but @xmath0 generated during this stage by vacuum fluctuations has been unknown until very recently  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that while the inflaton field @xmath7 is well anchored in a false vacuum , the comoving curvature perturbation , which is given by @xmath8 is ill defined .",
    "the origin of this difficulty is that during false vacuum inflation the inflaton @xmath7 is classically not moving , and there is no preferred time direction to define comoving hypersurfaces . but this phase should be broken , and indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath1 was calculated by incorporating a regularizing mass which scales as @xmath9 .",
    "the results are such that @xmath1 is dependent on the scale of the regularizing mass , with steeply blue index @xmath10  @xcite and nearly @xmath11 distribution is suppressed on large scales and is highly scale dependent with @xmath12 , since these are related to the properties of heavy fields in de sitter space . \" ]  @xcite .",

    "in addition to false vacuum inflation , we incorporate the curvaton mechanism  @xcite to generate the gaussian contribution of @xmath0 . in this combined scenario of false vacuum inflation and the curvaton mechanism , or shortly `` old curvaton ''",
    "scenario , as we will see we can build a concrete model with observationally consistent @xmath1 , while providing substantial degree of non - gaussian signature . especially , the bispectrum lies between the so - called equilateral and local types , giving a concrete example of mixed non - gaussianity .",

    "it is the so - called c - loop  @xcite .",

    "if one naively integrates from 0 to infinity , the integral badly diverges .",
    "however , actually we should appropriately regularize the integral as follows : we are interested in the large scale curvature perturbation produced during the false vacuum inflation stage .",
    "thus , we can trace the momentum up to the scale at which false vacuum inflation ends .",
    "that is , we should consider up to the scale @xmath41 which crosses the horizon at the moment the potential becomes concave down .",

    "the momentum scale which crosses the horizon at this moment is thus @xmath44 . the modes with larger wavenumbers @xmath45",
    "exit the horizon after the false vacuum inflation phase .",

    "finally , we would like to make some remarks on the aforementioned redefinition of the curvature perturbations . in the calculation",
    ", we have ignored the gravitational coupling between @xmath7 and @xmath63 , and assume these two fields are uncorrelated .",

    ", all the calculations presented in this section can be safely applied .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath0 produced during false vacuum inflation . because @xmath0 is intrinsically highly non - gaussian , the corresponding bispectrum exhibits a novel shape . using this result , we proposed the `` old curvaton '' scenario , where the gaussian contribution of the total curvature perturbation consistent with the current observations is provided by the curvaton .",
    "the resulting shape of the bispectrum is a mixed type , i.e. the combination of the novel `` false vacuum '' and the well known local shapes .",
    "in addition to the novel bispectrum , in the old curvaton scenario we also find relatively large running of the spectral index .    in the old curvaton scenario , both the inflaton and",
    "the curvaton play key roles in producing observable effects .",
    "moreover , there are possibly thermal components to confine the inflaton at the top of the potential .",
    "these components set up interesting connections between our work and some other recent progress on inflation and non - gaussianity :    @xmath97 _ quasi - single field inflation _ : in the old curvaton scenario , the curvaton field slowly rolls down its potential",
    ". one could think of this scenario in an alternative way : to interchange the name of the curvaton and the inflaton , so that inflation is driven by the curvaton field @xmath63 .",
    "then our model describes a slow roll inflation direction , plus another direction along which the field is trapped at the minimum of the potential . in this viewpoint",
    ", our model looks similar to quasi - single field inflation  @xcite .",
    "however , in quasi - single field inflation , the transition from the isocurvature perturbation to the curvature perturbation comes from direct coupling between the two directions . while in the old curvaton scenario , the transition comes from the non - conservation of curvature perturbation after the end of inflation , which is standard in the curvaton scenario .",
    "the origin of non - gaussianity is also different . in quasi - single field inflation",
    ", non - gaussianity originates from the interaction between the scalar fields . while in the old curvaton scenario , the non - gaussianity originates from the non - linear mapping from the scalar field fluctuation to the curvature perturbation .",
    "@xmath97 _ thermal non - gaussianity _ : in the old curvaton scenario , the effective potential can be obtained in several ways . a simple way is that the inflaton is trapped at the origin for some @xmath98-folds by thermal radiations  @xcite . it is possible that they also have non - gaussianities @xcite , which could be transferred to the curvature perturbation by gravitational or other couplings . here",
    "we note this possibility , and at the same time emphasize that this effect is under control in our model .",
    "thus we can turn off these contributions , and our previous calculations give the leading non - gaussianity .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to see whether there are parameter regions where these thermal effects can affect the running and the non - gaussianity , as well as the power spectrum and the spectral index  @xcite .",
    "@xmath97 _ multi - stream inflation _ :",
    "at the end of false vacuum inflation , the potential becomes unstable .",
    "then , the field could roll towards either @xmath99 or @xmath100 at different causal patches . as discussed in multi - stream inflation @xcite",
    ", these bifurcation does not necessarily lead to disasters , and can rather probably give rise to some interesting observational effects , such as features , non - gaussianities , and the cmb asymmetries at the bifurcation scale .",
    "however , these effects do not change the calculation and conclusion in our present paper , because they are associated with perturbations on smaller scales .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the old curvaton scenario and the related works we discussed above all belong to the attempts assuming that the inflationary dynamics is more complicated than the simplest single field slow roll inflation .",
    "recent progress in string theory , especially the string landscape  @xcite and related cosmology  @xcite , provides a theoretical playground , and also higher _ a priori _ expectation for the complicated inflationary dynamics .",
