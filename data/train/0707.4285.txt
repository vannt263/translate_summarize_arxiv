    "the local group is an excellent laboratory for studies of galaxy evolution , providing us with a wide range of different galaxy types in a variety of environments .",
    "the star formation ( sf ) histories of local group galaxies can be obtained from color - magnitude diagrams of resolved stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using this method it is possible to constrain the entire sf and chemical enrichment history of galaxies .",
    "however , the results are model - dependent , and should be compared with other , additional observational data which can be obtained for local group galaxies .",
    "one such complementary means of determining the sf and chemical evolution histories is a study of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , which can be used simultaneously as age , kinematics and metallicity tracers .",
    "the abundances from both hii regions and pne allow one to derive an approximate enrichment history for a galaxy from intermediate ages to the present day and permit abundance measurements at different locations .",
    "the latter , in turn , helps to test the homogeneity with which elements are distributed through a galaxy and , thus , the timescale for heavy element diffusion and mixing @xcite .    in this paper , we present new results of a pn study in the local group dwarf irregular galaxy ic10 , which is situated at low galactic latitude ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "estimates of the distance to ic10  vary , including values of 830@xmath4110 kpc , based on observations of cepheids @xcite ; 660@xmath466 kpc , based on cepheids and tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars @xcite ; and 741@xmath437 kpc , based on a study of carbon stars @xcite .",
    "ic10  is highly obscured , with @xmath5 @xcite . with the position of ic10  on the sky only @xmath618@xmath7 apart from m31 , @xcite suggests that it may be a member of the m31 subgroup .",
    "the large number of hii regions @xcite indicates that ic10  is undergoing a massive episode of sf .",
    "estimates of the intensity of sf were revised upward after many wr stars were discovered in ic10  @xcite .",
    "this number of wr stars is remarkable for a galaxy of its size and is at least a factor of two higher than the density of such stars seen in any other local group galaxy . this fact led @xcite to classify ic10  as a starburst galaxy , the only such object in the local group .",
    "@xcite concluded that ic10  should be considered a blue compact dwarf galaxy .",
    "sixteen pn candidates were identified in ic10  by @xcite on the basis of both [ oiii ] and h@xmath8+[nii ] continuum - subtracted images .",
    "no pne were found very close to the center of this galaxy , presumably because of the presence of numerous extended hii regions covering a large fraction of the galaxy s area .",
    "the distribution of m@xmath9 magnitudes for all detected pn candidates looks unusual since the brightest one is @xmath017 brighter than the next brightest .",
    "observations and analysis of three of these pn candidates are presented below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ obs_red ] gives a description of all observations and the data reduction .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ txt : res ] and discussed in section  [ txt : disc ] . throughout the paper , for distance - dependent parameters",
    "we have assumed a distance to ic10  of 740kpc @xcite .",
    "long - slit spectral observations were obtained with the scorpio multi - mode instrument @xcite installed in the prime focus of the sao 6 m telescope ( bta ) , during two nights in november 2004 .",
    "the vph550 g grism was used with the 2k@xmath102k ccd detector eev  42 - 40 , with an exposed region of 2048@xmath10600 px .",
    "this gave a wavelength range @xmath035007500    with @xmath02.0   pixel@xmath11 and fwhm @xmath012  along the dispersion direction .",
    "the scale along the slit was 018 pixel@xmath11 , with a total length of @xmath02and a slit width of 1  .",
    "the coordinates for the observed pn candidates were taken from @xcite .",
    "h@xmath8 acquisition images were obtained before the spectroscopic observations in order to select optimal positions for the slit . in these images , the candidate pn7 ( , @xmath12 = 59:20:01.6 from @xcite appeared as an elongated object consisting of two regions : a starlike one ( hereafter pn7a ) and an extended one ( hereafter pn7b ) .",
    "the slit was positioned to observe both of these simultaneously .",
    "( , ) is a starlike source .",
    "finding charts and the slit positions for our observations are shown in figure  [ fig : pne_direct ] .",
    "the exposure times used were 2@xmath1015 min for pn7 and 2@xmath1020 min for pn9 , and the candidates were observed at airmasses of 1.8 and 1.1 respectively .",
    "for wavelength calibration , the object spectra were complemented by reference he  ne  ar lamp spectra .",
    "bias and flat - field images were also acquired for a standard reduction of 2d spectra . the spectrophotometric standard star feige  34 @xcite was observed for flux calibration .",
    "reduction of all data was performed using the standard reduction systems midas and iraf .",
    "all cosmic ray hits were removed within midas , while the iraf package ccdred was used for bad pixel removal , trimming , bias - dark subtraction , slit profile and flat - field corrections . to achieve accurate wavelength calibration , correction for distortion and tilt for each frame , sky subtraction and the correction for atmospheric extinction , the iraf package longslit was used .",
    "then , using the data on the spectrophotometric standard star , each 2d spectrum was transformed to absolute fluxes and one - dimensional spectra were extracted to obtain the total observed emission line fluxes .",
    "all emission lines were measured using the midas programs described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , they measure the continuum with the method of @xcite , derive robust noise estimates , and fit resolved lines with a single gaussian superimposed on the continuum - subtracted spectrum . some emission lines which were not sufficiently separated atr the given spectral resolution were fitted simultaneously as a blend of two or three gaussian features .",
    "they include the h@xmath8 @xmath136563 and [ nii ] @xmath146548,6584 lines and the [ sii ] @xmath146716,6731 lines .",
    "the quoted errors of single line intensities include the following components : ( 1 ) errors related to the poisson statistics of line photon flux ; ( 2 ) the error resulting from the measurement of the underlying continuum , which gives the dominant contribution to the errors on faint lines ; ( 3 ) an additional error related to the goodness of fit for fluxes of blended lines ; and ( 4 ) a term related to the uncertainty in the spectral sensitivity curve ( 5% for the presented observations ) , which constitutes the main contribution to the errors of the relative intensities of strong lines .",
    "all these components are added in quadrature , and the total errors have been propagated to calculate the errors of all subsequently derived parameters .",
    "the relative intensities ( normalised to i(h@xmath15 ) ) of all measured emission lines , as well as the derived extinction coefficient c(h@xmath15 ) , the equivalent widths ( ews ) of balmer absorption lines , the measured flux of the h@xmath15 emission line , the measured heliocentric radial velocity , the electron density n@xmath16 , the calculated extinction @xmath17 , and the extinction value near @xmath135007   , @xmath18 @xcite are given in table  [ t : intens1 ] .",
    "the final reduced 1d spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : pne_spectra ] .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath19(h@xmath15 ) in all spectra are high and correspond respectively to the high derived values of @xmath20 . assuming a the milky way foreground extinction of @xmath21 in the direction of this galaxy @xcite , the internal extinction values @xmath22 vary in the range of 05 to 23 .",
    "the latter implies that ic10  contains a considerable amount of internal dust , a conclusion supported by many previous studies .",
    "because candidate pn7 was observed at high airmass ( 1.8 ) but not at the parallactic angle , it is possible that some flux may have been lost in the blue and/or red parts of the spectra . as h@xmath8 images were used to place objects on the slit , we most likely lost flux in the blue .",
    "based on @xcite , we estimate that we might have lost @xmath23 in the spectral region of h@xmath15 and @xmath05060% in the spectral region of h@xmath24 . for this reason ,",
    "the extinction values found for pn7 and shown in table  [ t : intens1 ] should be considered upper limits .",
    "our measured total [ oiii ] @xmath135007 emission line fluxes for both observed candidates are about 20 - 30%  lower than those presented by @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to a combination of non - photometric conditions during our observations and the non - parallactic observation angle used for pn7 .",
    "fortunately , the uncertain extinction determination for pn7 does not affect the results presented in section  [ txt : disc ] .",
    "the derived radial velocities of pn7a and pn7b are close to each other , supporting the idea that both objects belong to the same complex .",
    "their velocities are also close to the optical velocity of ic10 v@xmath25 = @xmath26348 km s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that hi velocities in ic10  range from @xmath26300 to @xmath26400 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "comparison of pn9 s position and its optical radial velocity with the 2d hi velocity distribution ( figure  7 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows agreement to within the uncertainties of our velocity measurements .",
    "thus , our radial velocities for both pn7 and pn9 support the idea that the observed pn candidates indeed belong to ic10 .",
    "most extragalactic pn candidates are point - like sources .",
    "the task of distinguishing between pne and compact hii regions in dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies is extremely difficult and can not be accomplished with morphological criteria alone .",
    "usually , the line ratio is used in searches for pn candidates with narrow - band imaging in h@xmath8 and [ oiii ] @xmath135007 lines .",
    "a criterion of @xmath27 for pn candidates was adopted by @xcite after the analysis of a large sample of extragalactic pne .",
    "however , it is well known that the ratio @xmath28 is a function of the absolute magnitude of pne , hence many extragalactic pn candidates can have @xmath29 ( see , e.g. , the list of pn candidates from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "definitive classification / separation can only be performed with classification / diagnostic diagrams , after candidate spectra have been obtained .",
    "pne spectra have the same emission lines as hii regions , but the central stars of pne are hotter than the ob stars in hii regions , and the line intensity ratios are different for this reason . in addition , the electron densities in most pne are higher than those in hii regions .",
    "empirical emission line diagrams are often used both to distinguish between different classes of ionized nebulae in the galaxy @xcite and different types of emission - line galaxies ( elgs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , unlike elg classification based on such diagrams , to our knowledge there are no published quantitative criteria for distinguishing pne from hii regions .",
    "analyses using the @xmath30 \\lambda5007/h\\beta$ ] ratio for classification purposes are absent from the literature as well , even though [ oiii]@xmath135007 is the strongest line in most pn spectra .    to fill this gap and to derive quantitative criteria for the objective spectral classification of pn candidates",
    ", we first used a subsample of spectra of hii regions ( hii galaxies ) from the sdss database @xcite .",
    "their line intensity ratios are shown in figures  [ fig : pne_class ] and [ fig : pne_class1 ] .",
    "these data cover very large ranges for a variety of emission line intensity ratios in hii galaxies of different excitation types , and therefore can be used to define their loci properly .",
    "secondly , we compiled from the literature a sample of extragalactic pne with published spectra or emission line measurements .",
    "data from the following galaxies were included : m  31 @xcite , m  33 @xcite , lmc and smc @xcite , sextans  a and sextans  b @xcite , leo  a @xcite , ngc  6822 @xcite , fornax @xcite , sagittarius @xcite , ngc  147 @xcite , m  32 @xcite , ngc  205 @xcite , and ngc  5128 @xcite . in cases for which measurements of [ sii ] lines in pne and pn candidates were not available , and for which we have data ( pne in sextans  b and pn7 in ic10 ) , @xmath31 upper limits were calculated .",
    "these upper limits are shown as well with arrows .",
    "our data for ic10  were not used for criteria selection .    in total , we collected a sample of 259 different extragalactic pne with measurements of all the emission line intensities we are considering : [ oiii ] @xmath135007 , h@xmath15 , h@xmath8 , [ nii ] @xmath136584 , and [ sii ] @xmath146716,6731 .",
    "we did not require separate measurements of the [ sii ] @xmath146716,6731 lines for this sample , which we used for calculation of the overall selection efficiency .",
    "a subsample of 227 extragalactic pne with resolved measurements of [ sii ] @xmath146716,6731 was used to estimate the selection efficiency for criteria involving the use of the sulphur lines .",
    "our analysis has shown that it is possible to classify / separate almost all collected extragalactic pne , if at least two ( main ) diagrams are used : vs. and vs. .",
    "however , it is worth noting that most of these pne can easily be separated with only the first diagram , which utilizes the strongest emission lines easily detectable in both pne and hii regions .",
    "it is clearly seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : pne_class ] that most pne are located in the same area as agns and can be easily distinguished with the model track of @xcite , often used for agn / hii segregation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the demarcation line from this model is shown as a solid line in figure  [ fig : pne_class ] .",
    "we use this to construct the first quantitative criterion for the pne selection : @xmath32 /h\\beta ) } \\ge ( 0.61/\\log{([{n\\,\\textsc{ii } } ] /h\\alpha ) } - 0.47 ) + 1.19}\\ ] ] this allows us to identify 76%  of all objects from the compiled list as pne .",
    "however , the subsample of pn in leo  a , four pne in sextans  b , the pn7a and pn7b candidates in ic10  and some pne candidates from m33 , lmc and smc form a locus in the area of hii regions , so that other classification diagrams must be used to separate them .",
    "the use of the diagram vs. ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pne_class ] ) and the @xcite model s demarcation line @xmath33 /h\\beta ) } \\ge ( 0.72/\\log{([{s\\,\\textsc{ii } } ] /h\\alpha ) } - 0.32 ) + 1.30}\\ ] ] does not help , since more pne appear in the region of hii compared with those found in the diagram vs. .",
    "the classification efficiency of criterion ( [ equ:1a ] ) for our compiled pne sample is only 62% .",
    "thus we did not use the classification diagram vs. in any further analysis .",
    "the separation of supernova remnants ( snrs ) is outside the scope of the current study .",
    "however , we suggest that most snrs can also be distinguished with the use of the diagram vs. , the model lines from @xcite , and the addition of model lines for liner selection from @xcite and @xcite , as was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the latter is possible since both liners and snrs have significant emission contributions from shock excitation .",
    "all such objects are located below the line corresponding to criterion ( [ equ:1 ] ) .",
    "the locus of snrs found in m  33 @xcite supports this conclusion .",
    "the diagram vs. ( shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : pne_class1 ] ) , can be used as an additional diagnostic for the identification of pne . from the analysis of our compiled pn data we have found that , with the use of only the criterion : @xmath34 /h\\alpha ) } \\le 0.63 \\cdot \\log{([{n\\,\\textsc{ii } } ] /h\\alpha ) } - 0.55}\\ ] ] 83%  of our pne can be recovered . however , with the combined use of criteria ( [ equ:2 ] ) and ( [ equ:1 ] ) , 99%  of pne can be distinguished from hii regions ( i.e. , all but two cases ) . any analysed object is classified as a pn if it is located in the pne locus according to at least of one of the cited criteria .",
    "it should be noted that , for many extragalactic pne the detection of [ sii ] @xmath146716,6731 lines is difficult , since the ratio i([sii ] @xmath146716,6731)/i(h@xmath15 ) is typically @xmath00.55% .",
    "however , upper limits for this line ratio can be successfully used in this situation , similar to the cases of the pne from sextans  b and the candidate pn9 in ic10 .",
    "this second criterion is also very useful for rejecting possible snrs , which fill the locus shown with the dashed line in the top panel of figure  [ fig : pne_class1 ] .",
    "the last classification diagram we considered is the relation between the flux ratio of the two lines of the [ sii ] @xmath136716/@xmath136731 doublet and that of the flux ratio of the [ nii ] @xmath136584 and h@xmath8 lines : [ sii ] @xmath136716/@xmath136731 vs. .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pne_class1 ] .",
    "the criteria below @xmath35 \\lambda6716/\\lambda6731 \\le -0.135 \\cdot \\log{([{n\\,\\textsc{ii } } ] /h\\alpha ) } + 0.90 }   \\\\\\ ] ] @xmath36 /h\\alpha ) } \\ge -0.25}\\ ] ] select 81%  of pne that have their [ sii ] @xmath146716,6731 lines measured separately . with a combination of criteria ( [ equ:1 ] ) and ( [ equ:2 ] ) ,",
    "only one more pn is selected and the total selection efficiency reaches 99.6% .",
    "just one pn from our compiled list , mcmp49 in m  33 @xcite , can not be identified as a genuine pn using all the diagrams .",
    "the ic10  candidate pn9 observed in this work can be confidently classified as a true pn according to both criteria ( [ equ:1 ] ) and ( [ equ:2 ] ) .",
    "however , according to all classification diagrams shown in figures  [ fig : pne_class ] and [ fig : pne_class1 ] , ic10  candidates pn7a and pn7b , can not be selected as pne and for this reason were finally classified as compact hii regions . an additional reason to believe that pn7a and pn7b are hii regions",
    "is the detection of continuum in their spectra ( see figure  [ fig : pne_spectra ] ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude cutoff of the pne [ oiii ] @xmath135007 luminosity function ( pnlf ) is considered to be constant in large galaxies with a large population of pne , and is equal to @xmath37-@xmath38 @xcite . for dwarf galaxies , this cutoff is likely shifted towards the fainter magnitudes as a function of the galaxy mass and the population size @xcite .",
    "@xcite also examined the effects of metallicity on the luminosity of the brightest pn . according to their models ,",
    "the variation of the cutoff magnitude @xmath39 with oxygen abundance is described by the relation @xmath40 ^ 2 + 0.225 \\cdot [ o / h ] + 0.014},\\ ] ] where [ o / h ] is the system s logarithmic oxygen abundance referenced to the solar value 12+log(o / h ) = 8.87 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the accuracy of @xmath39 and found that @xmath37-@xmath41 after the correction for metallicity using equation ( [ equ : abun ] ) .",
    "the brightest pne absolute magnitudes should be reasonably close to m@xmath42 .",
    "with pn7 , the brightest candidate in ic10  from @xcite , m@xmath42 for this galaxy can be calculated as @xmath43 , where for candidate pn7",
    "@xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 , assuming background extinction of @xmath46 @xcite and a distance modulus @xmath47 = 24.35 @xcite .",
    "adopting the value of 12+@xmath48(o / h ) = 8.19 , [ o / h ] = @xmath260.68 and @xmath49 = 0.29 , respectively for ic10  we expect the ` corrected ' cutoff magnitude for the ic10  pnlf to be @xmath37-@xmath50 .",
    "thus , the calculated m@xmath42 for pn7 appears @xmath0115 brighter than the standard value .",
    "after the rejection of the pn7 candidate as an hii region based on the results of our observations , the pnlf for pn candidates in ic10  is shown in figure  [ fig : pnlf_ic10 ] , where data from @xcite have been binned into 06 intervals . poisson @xmath51 error bars are shown for the detected number of pne in these bins .",
    "we have fitted this pnlf with a `` universal '' pnlf @xcite , taking only the brightest pne ( first three bins , eleven pne in total ) into account and using a uniform foreground extinction of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the result of this fitting and poisson errors are also shown in figure  [ fig : pnlf_ic10 ] . with this small sample",
    "we obtained the distance modulus ( including the error in @xmath39 ) , corresponding to a distance d = 725@xmath1 kpc ; this is very close to the value from @xcite .",
    "this distance modulus is also consistent with the recent estimate @xmath52 in @xcite , obtained from the study of individual rgb stars . with the pn data in hand",
    ", a distance to ic10  of 950 mpc @xcite seems implausible .",
    "the pnlf dip after the first three bins is likely a result of incompleteness , or could arise in a young population in which central star evolution proceeds very quickly @xcite .",
    "such a dip is also detected in the pnlfs in ngc6822 @xcite , the small magellanic cloud and m33 @xcite .",
    "of course , pn candidates , not confirmed pne , were used for the pnlf calculation ( except in the case of pn9 , which was confirmed in this paper ) , making this result for the ic10  pnlf distance somewhat preliminary . however , all the bright pn candidates that were used for the pnlf fitting have @xmath27 @xcite and thus have a very high probability of being real pne .    the calculated distance to ic10",
    "obviously depends on the extinction values used ; higher extinction values would place ic10  even closer to us .",
    "the total extinction value toward ic10  is a combination of foreground ( i.e. , galactic ) extinction , and the extinction internal to ic10  ; this latter quantity is quite uncertain , and for this reason only foreground extinction is usually considered ( as we have done in this work ) .",
    "the great advantage of pnlf distance calculations ( compared to other methods ) is that , in principle , the total extinction along the line of sight can be calculated after proper spectral observations of pn candidates and calculations of c(h@xmath15 ) for each pn @xcite .",
    "for this reason further spectroscopic observations of other pn candidates in ic10  are very important .",
    "on the other hand , total extinctions calculated using c(h@xmath15 ) for pne have to be used carefully , since could be strongly affected by extinction in localised circumstellar material .",
    "for this reason we do not make further use of the extinction we derive from the spectrum of pn9 in ic10 ; instead , we plan to map the line - of - sight extinction in its neighbourhood through observations of nearby hii regions .",
    "in this paper we present the first results of follow - up spectroscopy of pn candidates in the local group starburst galaxy ic10 . based on our data and the discussion above",
    ", we draw the following conclusions :    \\1 . from the obtained spectral data and the emission line diagnostic diagrams we have found that the brightest candidate pn7 from the list of @xcite is not a genuine pn , but rather a close pair of compact hii regions .",
    "the calculated absolute magnitude m@xmath42 for pn7 is about 115 brighter than the standard maximum value from the pn luminosity function expected at the approximate distance of ic10 .",
    "we have found that pn9 , obtained from the same list of candidate pne , is a true pn , and thus is the first confirmed pn in ic10 .    \\3 . with the available pn candidate data",
