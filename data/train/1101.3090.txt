    "theoretical and numerical studies indicate that specific physical conditions are needed for planets to form in circumstellar disks and understanding disk properties may therefore help to choose between competing planet formation scenarios . in the past decade",
    ", much effort has been made to survey circumstellar disks around low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the nearby star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* and many others ) .",
    "however , these studies have mostly focused on the late evolution stage when the disk , if favorably located and inclined , is accessible for observations . on the contrary ,",
    "the early embedded stage , when the disk is shrouded by a natal cloud core , is difficult to probe with the modern observational techniques and only a handful of attempted studies have been done so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context ,",
    "a numerical investigation into the properties of protostellar disks in the embedded phase of star formation ( hereafter , epsf ) is of considerable interest .    while there are plenty of theoretical and numerical studies addressing stability , fragmentation , and mass transport in circumstellar disks ( e.g.",

    "* ) , other disk properties such as masses , sizes , typical temperatures and densities have received considerably less attention owing to the ( technical ) difficulty with forming circumstellar disks self - consistently in numerical hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "indeed , numerical modeling of _ isolated _ disks can not provide reliable information on , for example , disk masses and sizes because they depend on the initial masses and rotation rates of parent cloud cores .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations that do form disks self - consistently often focus on the radial gas surface density and temperature profiles @xcite , accretion properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and time evolution of disk and stellar masses @xcite .",
    "in addition , they often adopt many simplifying assumptions such as the barotropic equation of state , disk axisymmetry , etc .",
    "three - dimensional numerical hydrodynamics simulations often suffer from a small number of considered models due to an enormous computational load ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a comprehensive numerical analysis of embedded disks , which , for the first time , includes obtaining the typical disk masses , radii , temperatures , and densities in the class 0 and i phases of star formation for a wide spectrum of initial cloud core masses and angular momenta .",
    "we utilize two - dimensional numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin - disk approximation with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics .",
    "this allows us to model the formation and long - term evolution of protostellar disks and derive useful statistical relations between various disk properties and stellar masses and also make suggestions about the giant planet formation perspective in the epsf .",
    "this is the third paper in a series focusing on the properties of circumstellar disks around ( sub-)solar mass stars in the embedded phase of star formation .",
    "two previous papers were mainly dedicated to the stability , fragmentation , accretion properties @xcite , and also to the radial structure of protostellar disks @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we provide a brief description of our numerical model .",
    "section  [ initial ] summarizes the initial parameters of cloud cores .",
    "section  [ scheme ] provides details on the adopted classification scheme for young stellar objects and also on the procedure for distinguishing between the disk and infalling envelope .",
    "the main results are presented in section  [ diskproperties ] and are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the model caveats are discussed in section  [ caveats ] .",
    "the main concepts of our approach are explained in detail in @xcite and are briefly reviewed below .",
    "we make use of numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin - disk approximation to compute the gravitational collapse of rotating , gravitationally unstable cloud cores .",
    "this approximation is an excellent means to calculate the evolution for many orbital periods and many model parameters .",
    "we start our numerical integration in the pre - stellar phase , which is characterized by a collapsing _ starless _ cloud core , continue into the embedded phase of star formation , during which a star , disk , and envelope are formed , and terminate our simulations in the t tauri phase , when most of the envelope has accreted onto the forming star / disk system . in the epsf , the disk occupies the innermost region of our numerical grid , while the larger outer part of the grid is taken up by the infalling envelope , the latter being the remnant of the parent cloud core .",
    "this ensures that the protostellar disk is not isolated in the epsf but is exposed to intense mass loading from the envelope .",
    "in addition , the mass accretion rate onto the disk @xmath6 is not a free parameter of the model but is self - consistently determined by the gas dynamics in the envelope .",
    "we introduce a `` sink cell '' at @xmath7  au and impose a free outflow condition on both boundaries so that the matter is allowed to flow out of the computational domain but is prevented from flowing in .",
    "we monitor the gas density in the sink cell and when its value exceeds a critical value for the transition from isothermal to adiabatic evolution ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) , we introduce a central point - mass star . in the subsequent evolution , 90% of the gas that crosses the inner boundary",
    "is assumed to land onto the central star plus the inner axisymmetric disk at @xmath10  au .",
    "the other 10% of the accreted gas is assumed to be carried away with protostellar jets .",
    "main physical processes that are taken into account in our modeling include stellar irradiation , background irradiation with temperature @xmath11  k , viscous and shock heating , radiative cooling from the disk surface , and also disk self - gravity .",
    "the corresponding equations of mass , momentum , and energy transport are    @xmath12    @xmath13_p =    - \\nabla_p { \\cal p }   + \\sigma \\ , { \\mbox{\\boldmath$ g $ } } _ p + \\\\ \\nonumber & + & ( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\pi})_p ,   \\label{energ}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath14    where subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the planar components @xmath17 in polar coordinates , @xmath18 is the mass surface density , @xmath19 is the internal energy per surface area , @xmath20 is the vertically integrated form of the gas pressure @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the radially and azimuthally varying vertical scale height determined in each computational cell using an assumption of local hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath23 is the velocity in the disk plane , @xmath24 is the gravitational acceleration in the disk plane , and @xmath25 is the gradient along the planar coordinates of the disk .",
    "viscosity enters the basic equations via the viscous stress tensor @xmath26 .",
    "we parameterize the magnitude of kinematic viscosity @xmath27 using a modified form of the @xmath28-prescription @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the square of effective sound speed calculated at each time step from the model s known @xmath31 and @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath32 $ ] is a modification to the usual @xmath28-prescription that guarantees that the turbulent viscosity operates only in the disk and quickly reduces to zero beyond the disk radius @xmath33 . in this paper",
    ", we use a spatially and temporally uniform @xmath28 , with its value set to @xmath34 .",
    "radiative cooling from the disk surface is determined using the diffusion approximation of the vertical radiation transport in a one - zone model of the vertical disk structure @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath37 is the midplane temperature of gas , and @xmath38 is a function that secures a correct transition between the cooling function ( from both surfaces of the disk ) in the optically thick regime @xmath39 and the optically thin one @xmath40 .",
    "we use frequency - integrated opacities of @xcite .",
    "the heating function is expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the irradiation temperature at the disk surface determined by the stellar and background black - body irradiation as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the uniform background temperature ( in our model set to the initial temperature of the natal cloud core ) and @xmath45 is the radiation flux ( energy per unit time per unit surface area ) absorbed by the disk surface at radial distance @xmath46 from the central star .",
    "the latter quantity is calculated as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the incidence angle of radiation arriving at the disk surface at radial distance @xmath46 , @xmath49 is a time - dependent factor that is introduced to account for the possible attenuation of stellar radiation by the envelope quickly approaches unity with time . for a typical run , @xmath50 at @xmath51  myr after the formation of the central star and @xmath52 at @xmath53  myr . ] , and @xmath54 is the sum of the accretion luminosity @xmath55 arising from the gravitational energy of accreted gas and the photospheric luminosity @xmath56 due to gravitational compression and deuterium burning in the star interior .",
    "viscous heating operates in the disk interior and is calculated using the standard expression @xmath57 .",
    "heating due to shock waves is taken into account via compressional heating @xmath58 and artificial viscosity .",
    "the vertically integrated gas pressure @xmath31 and internal energy per surface area @xmath19 are related via the ideal equation of state @xmath59 , with the ratio of specific heats @xmath60 .",
    "equations  ( [ cont])([energ ] ) are solved using the method of finite differences with a time - explicit , operator - split solution procedure in polar coordinates @xmath61 on a numerical grid with @xmath62 grid zones .",
    "advection is treated using the van leer interpolation scheme .",
    "the update of the internal energy per surface area @xmath19 due to cooling @xmath63 and heating @xmath64 is done implicitly using the newton - raphson method of root finding , complemented by the bisection method where the newton - raphson iterations fail to converge .",
    "the radial points are logarithmically spaced .",
    "the innermost grid point is located at the position of the sink cell @xmath7  au , and the size of the first adjacent cell varies in the 0.070.1  au range depending on the cloud core size .",
    "this corresponds to the radial resolution of @xmath65=1.11.6  au at 100  au .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "initially isothermal ( @xmath66  k ) cloud cores have surface densities @xmath18 and angular velocities @xmath67 typical for a collapsing , axisymmetric , magnetically supercritical core @xcite @xmath68 @xmath69 , \\label{omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the central angular velocity and @xmath71 is the radius of central near - constant - density plateau defined as @xmath72 . with this choice of @xmath71 , equation  ( [ dens ] ) at large radii @xmath73 leads to the gas volume density distribution @xmath74 , if the latter is integrated in the vertical direction assuming a local vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this means that our initial gas surface density configuration can be considered to have a factor of @xmath77 positive density enhancement compared to that of the singular isothermal sphere @xmath78 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath79 .",
    ".model parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      throughout the paper , we have adopted a characteristic transitional density between the disk and envelope of @xmath80  g  @xmath81 . here",
    ", we illustrate the effect of a factor of two smaller @xmath82  g  @xmath81 .",
    "top panel in figure  [ fig9 ] shows the disk mass versus time for @xmath80  g  @xmath81 ( solid line ) and @xmath82  g  @xmath81 ( dashed line ) , while the bottom panel presents disk radii for the corresponding transitional densities .",
    "it is evident that the disk mass is little affected by a factor of 2 drop in @xmath83 , owing to an exponentially declining gas surface density in the disk outer regions .",
    "the disk radii are somewhat more sensitive to @xmath84 , yet showing only a factor of 1.2 increase on average .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] convincingly demonstrates that our model results are not critically sensitive to the choice of @xmath84 .      in this paper",
    ", we have taken the simplest approach and assumed that 10% of the mass passing through the sink cell is subsequently ejected with protostellar jets .",
    "this number has some motivation since observations of the variation of jet diameters with distance from their driving sources have been consistent with models giving the jet efficiency of @xmath85 @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "theoretical and numerical studies suggest a higher jet efficiency , of up to 70% depending on the degree of core flattening ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to a three - dimensional nature of the jet phenomenon . in this case , not only the wind material is lost but also the envelope material is entrained and evacuated , driving massive molecular outflows .",
    "it is however very difficult to self - consistently take into account the removal of the envelope material by jets in our two - dimensional simulations .",
    "we postpone the solution of this problem to a later time , when an accurate vertical disk structure is implemented in the code , and note that a higher jet efficiency ( than currently adopted ) may result in lower final stellar and disk masses .    another issue associated with the thin - disk model",
    "is that the envelope material is forced to land all at once onto the disk outer edge , while in three dimensions it may cover a larger area above and below the disk surface .",
    "however , numerical simulations of gas trajectories in flaring disks ( our model disks have the aspect ratio @xmath86 ) indicate that the bulk of the envelope material ( up to 80% ) still lands onto the disk outer edge @xcite .",
    "the remaining fraction falls onto the disk surface , triggering the streaming instability due to the vertical sheer in the gas velocity .",
    "this instability acts to further destabilize the disk and increase the mass and angular momentum transport in protostellar disks @xcite , an effect missing in the current two - dimensional disk model .",
    "the net result is some decrease in the disk mass and an equivalent increase in the stellar mass .",
    "using numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin - disk approximation , we model the formation and evolution of protostellar disks in the embedded phase of star formation ( epsf ) when the disks are exposed to intense mass loading from natal cloud cores .",
    "a wide spectrum of initial core masses and ratios @xmath87 of the rotational to gravitational energy is considered , which allows us to construct statistical relations between disk masses @xmath88 , disk outer radii @xmath33 , and stellar masses @xmath89 .",
    "typical gas surface densities and midplane temperatures at 40  au and 100  au are derived and analyzed as a function of stellar mass .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "our numerical modeling reveals that most of the class 0 and i objects with stellar masses @xmath90 are characterized by disk masses and gas surface densities greater than that of the minimum mass solar nebular , the latter defined as in @xcite . at the same time , disk radii for these objects start to grow beyond 100  au , making gravitational fragmentation possible .",
    "these results suggest that giant planet formation may commence as early as in the class  0 phase , substantiating an earlier conclusion of @xcite based on the statistics of observationally inferred disk masses in different stages of star formation .",
    "* disk masses in the epsf show a near - linear correlation with stellar masses .",
    "the correlation may weaken somewhat if more models with low @xmath87 are considered but is unlikely to break completely . *",
    "a wide scatter of disk masses for a given stellar mass is likely caused by the distribution in the initial conditions of cloud cores and , in particular , by a wide spectrum of initial rotation rates .",
    "* our mean and median disk masses in the class  0 and i phases ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , respectively ) are _ greater _ than those inferred from observations by ( at least ) a factor of 23 . we show that this difference may be caused by high opacity in the inner disk regions .",
    "* disk - to - star mass ratios are found to lie mostly in the @xmath91 range , with the mean and median values @xmath92 in the class 0 and i phases .",
    "objects with @xmath93 are rare due to fast accumulation of disk mass in the early class  0 phase , while objects with @xmath94 quickly evolve into binary or multiple systems , thus effectively reducing the disk mass .",
    "the least - squares fitting reveals little correlation between @xmath95 and @xmath89 in the epsf . *",
    "our modeling predicts a sub - linear ( close to a square root ) scaling between time - averaged disk outer radii and stellar masses .",
    "disks grow in size in the epsf due to mass loading from collapsing cores .",
    "our mean and median values in the class 0 and i phases ( @xmath96  au , @xmath97  au and @xmath98  au , @xmath99  au , respectively ) suggest that protostellar disks are large enough for giant planets to form via disk fragmentation . *",
    "we find sub - linear correlations between gas surface densities at 40  au and 100  au and stellar masses and also a square - root scaling between disk midplane temperatures and stellar masses , implying that massive disks are denser and hotter than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "although disk conditions seem to be favorable for giant planets to start forming as early as in the epsf , we want to stress that the direct gravitational instability scenario may encounter serious difficulties caused by rapid inward migrations of the forming protoplanetary embryos @xcite .",
    "according to recent numerical hydrodynamics simulations by @xcite , the fraction of systems with survived embryos amounts to 10% at best .",
