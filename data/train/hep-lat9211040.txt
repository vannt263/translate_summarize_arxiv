    "we present results obtained for the light hadron spectrum on a lattice at @xmath0 using both the standard wilson action and this @xmath1-improved clover action .      the simulations were performed on the meiko i860 computing surface sited in edinburgh .",

    "the comparison of the results for the two fermion actions is performed on the same 18 configurations . for each action",

    "as reported in  @xcite , we found that the correlators obtained using the clover action were somewhat noisier and so we have smeared the clover propagators at the sink to improve the signal .",
    "we also present results for the clover action on 36 configurations with 3 @xmath8 values and a local sink .",
    "the most computationally expensive part of this study was calculating the quark propagators .",
    "we find that red - black preconditioning improves the efficiency by a factor of 3 and that , for the range of pseudoscalar masses investigated , minimal residual is typically twice as efficient as conjugate gradient . in agreement with the study reported by hockney in  @xcite , we see only a small gain from over - relaxation for mr at @xmath0 .",
