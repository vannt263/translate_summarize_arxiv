    "ngc 5128 ( centaurus a ) , the nearby giant elliptical galaxy , hosts the closest powerful active galactic nucleus .",
    "this double - lobed radio source contains a strong jet discovered in x - rays ( @xcite , @xcite ) and well - studied in radio with the vla ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and with the vlbi ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the proximity of ngc 5128 makes it one of the best candidates for studying the inner region around a massive black hole , assumed by the standard model to be at the core of all agns ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the large warped dust lane , approximately an arcminute wide with associated gas , young stars , and hii regions , dominates the morphology and polarization properties at visible wavelengths , effectively obscuring the nucleus and inner half - kiloparsec of the galaxy and the jet .",
    "ground - based ir observations have provided evidence for a strong , heavily polarized source at the nucleus ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "previous hst wf / pc-1 imaging polarimetry of the inner region of ngc5128 ( @xcite ) identified the nucleus of the galaxy with the most obscured and reddened feature of the emission , several arcseconds sw of the brightest optical emission near the center of the dust lane and consistent with the ir results .    while the discovery of gas disks at the centers of nearby galaxies with hst has opened up new possibilities for determining masses of central black holes by studying kinematics of the disks ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) the dust lane does not permit such studies for ngc 5128 in the optical .",
    "we report here hst near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) observations at 2.2  and  which allow us , for the first time , to study the structure of the circumnuclear region at high resolution .",
    "we summarize the observations and data reduction in section 2 , the results in section 3 , and discuss the implications of these data for standard agn and jet models in sections 4 and 5 . throughout",
    ", we assume a distance to centaurus a of 3.5 mpc ( @xcite ) , whence 1@xmath117pc .",
    "the nuclear region of ngc 5128 was observed for three orbits on 11 august 1997 using nicmos camera 2 ( 0075/pixel ) with f222 m , f187n and f190n filters .",
    "all observations were carried out with a multiaccum sequence ( @xcite ) , the detector read out non - destructively several times during each integration to facilitate removal of cosmic rays and saturated pixels .",
    "the integration times were 2304 sec for the f187n and f190n filters (  and adjacent continuum ) and 1280 sec for the f222 m filter ( 2.2medium band continuum ) .",
    "the last observation was also performed off - source to enable telescope thermal background subtraction .",
    "the data were calibrated using the pipeline software calnica v3.0 ( @xcite ) and the best reference files in the hubble data archive to produce flux calibrated images .",
    "a continuum - subtracted  image was obtained by direct subtraction of the f187n and f190n images .",
    "we verified the continuum subtraction by rescaling the continuum by up to @xmath4 before subtraction and establishing that this did not significantly affect the observed emission line structure .    a small ( few percent ) drift in the nicmos bias level resulted in spatially dependent residuals in the calibrated images ( the `` pedestal '' problem , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect was removed by fitting and subtracting a first degree polynomial surface to each quadrant of the continuum subtracted images .",
    "the calibrated 2.2 @xmath5 m continuum image in fig .",
    "[ fig : continua ] shows the rather smooth and regular structure expected for a typical elliptical galaxy .",
    "this smooth structure on small scales contrasts strongly with the patchy and irregular emission observed on the same spatial scales in r and i with wf / pc-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the continuum image is dominated by a strong unresolved source which we interpret as the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "the intensity of the nucleus is estimated by fitting a model psf derived using the tinytim software ( @xcite ) .",
    "we took particular care in removing the psf artifacts present beyond the first airy ring .",
    "the total non - stellar plus stellar flux of the unresolved nuclear source is ( 2.3@xmath60.1 ) erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 @xmath8 ( magnitude 10.52@xmath60.05 in the vega reference system ) .",
    "[ fig : radprof ] shows the azimuthally averaged radial light profile obtained by fitting ellipses to the isophotes in the f222 m image and comparing with the model psf fitted to the data .",
    "the nucleus position is ra=13:25:27.46 , dec=-43:01:10.2 ( j2000 ) , with the @xmath61  uncertainty of the hst guide star catalogue ( gsc ) .",
    "this position is consistent with that found in the radio and ground based ir data , and with both the peak of reddening and the peak of polarization found with wf / pc-1 .",
    "in contrast to the relatively smooth light distribution seen in f222 m , the continuum subtracted  image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pa ] ) reveals a number of emission features above the threshold of 6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 arcsec@xmath9 ( 3@xmath10 of the noise measured in emission free areas ) .",
    "in addition to the unresolved nuclear source , there is a prominent elongated structure , with some sub - structure , centered on the nucleus , a finger ( n1a ) @xmath109 n - e of the nucleus , two arc - like filaments ( a , b ) located , respectively , at @xmath1 29 n - e and 35 n - n - e of the nucleus , and several other weaker emission knots and filaments distributed over the field of view .",
    "the dominant feature by far is the structure around the nucleus .",
    "isophotal ellipse fitting gives an average ellipticity of 0.5 and a constant position angle of 33  outside a radius of @xmath1101 , within which the nucleus dominates .",
    "the total extension along the major axis is @xmath1 23 ( @xmath1 40pc ) and the total flux from the extended nuclear emission above the level of 1.1 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 arcsec@xmath9 is ( 3.9@xmath60.4 ) erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 . in comparison ,",
    "the observed flux from the unresolved  emission is ( 5.7@xmath60.6 ) erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : pacont ] overlaying the  contours on a gray scale plot of the nuclear emission after subtracting the isophotal fit model clearly shows n1a and another sub - structure s - s - e of the nucleus .",
    "the elongated structure around the nucleus seen in  emission has an overall extent of @xmath12 parsecs .",
    "its position angle of 33is approximately perpendicular to that of the dust lane .",
    "it is not oriented along the axis of the x - ray / radio jet , which has a position angle of @xmath11 50 - 55  as seen at x - ray ( @xcite ) , cm ( @xcite ) and vlbi ( @xcite ) wavelengths .",
    "it is also not perpendicular to the jet axis , as reported for an extended structure seen with isocam at much lower resolution in the near ir at p.a .",
    "@xmath13 ( @xcite ) , nor is it consistent with the orientation of a ring with a radius of @xmath1100 pc perpendicular to the radio jet , reported by @xcite . as such , we believe that we are observing a new feature , not directly related to the radio / x - ray jet or to any previously reported optical or ir features .",
    "we have verified that the observed elongation is not the result of varying extinction in front of a smooth circular emission region .",
    "indeed , if the extinction is maximum at the nucleus and decreases outwards in a direction perpendicular to the dust lane , the resulting morphology would be elongated in the direction of this extinction gradient .",
    "we calculated the ir reddening correction map by adopting the procedure presented in @xcite , comparing the colors obtained in recent wfpc2 observations ( @xcite ) with our nicmos continuum images , using the reddening law of @xcite with @xmath14 , and assuming a constant intrinsic color over the field of view of nicmos ; this latter assumption is supported by an i - k vs v - i color diagram where most of the points lie tightly along the reddening line . applying the derived reddening correction to the  image does not significantly affect the morphology of the observed structure .",
    "hst observations of other agns suggest three possible explanations for the observed elongated structure : 1 ) gas which is shocked and compressed by interaction with the jet ; 2 ) illumination of gas clouds by an anisotropic nuclear radiation field ( i.e. an ionization cone , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) ; and 3 ) a gaseous disk , such as that of m87 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the structure s position angle differs by @xmath15 from the jet axis ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pacont ] ) .",
    "this significant misalignment suggests the emission is not due to a current jet - cloud interaction , especially when we see other  features well correlated with the radio / x - ray jet morphology ( see next section ) .",
    "it has long been hypothesized that the radio jet had a different ( smaller ) position angle in the past , creating the n - s orientation of the outer lobes , and then rotating to form first the inner lobes and then the currently observed x - ray / radio jet . in this",
    "regard we note that the outer edge of the n - e inner lobe does have structure aligned with the position angle of our feature ; both could be gas shocked by the jet ( perhaps two - sided ) at some recent time , and not yet cooled down .",
    "existing radio and x - ray measurements do not provide added information on this small spatial scale .    the @xmath15 misalignment with the jet",
    "does allow the elongated structure to lie well within a putative ionization cone .",
    "we note that most of the other detected emission features would also lie within such a cone if it has an opening half - angle of at least @xmath16 , well within the limits postulated by the unified model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as it stands , we can not rule out clouds densely distributed along this position angle , embedded in a large opening angle radiation field .",
    "however , the relative thickness of the feature in the transverse direction and the symmetry around the nucleus suggest that this is not the case .",
    "we find the simplest interpretation for the elongated emission to be a gaseous disk around the nucleus , as seen on larger scales around other galactic nuclei .",
    "it could be the outer part of an accretion disk , expected around a massive black - hole at the core of this agn .",
    "if the structure is indeed a thin circular disk , the axial ratio suggests an inclination of @xmath160  .",
    "its radius of @xmath17 ( @xmath18pc ) makes it significantly smaller than the hundred parsec scale stellar disks observed by hst at the centers of many galaxies .",
    "this gas disk could be readily ionized by the powerful agn , seen in x- and @xmath19-rays .",
    "the flux of photons required to keep the  emitting material ionized can be computed following @xcite : after dereddening ( = 10 mag ) and assuming case b recombination for = k and = @xmath20 , we find a value of 4 photons s@xmath8 .",
    "this is a small fraction of the total expected emission from the agn .",
    "note that the nucleus has an extinction of up to 70mag along the line of sight , estimated from x - ray observations .",
    "however , while being within the ionization cone the disk is well outside the obscuring torus , and subject to a a much lower extinction from the nucleus .",
    "we thus assume = 10 mag as a reasonable upper estimate of the foreground extinction , following schreier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who found a peak extinction of = 7 mag in the optical .",
    "the mass of the gas responsible for both extended and unresolved nuclear emission is estimated from the standard relation , @xmath214@xmath22 : @xmath23 where  is the proton density , v is the volume of the emitting gas , @xmath24 is the line emissivity , @xmath25 is the proton mass , @xmath26 is the observed  flux in units of erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 and @xmath27 is the reddening correction if  is different from the assumed 10 mag .",
    "this modest mass estimate of m @xmath114   depends mostly on the assumed gas density (= @xmath20 ) and is extremely uncertain , but we believe that a disk of  to  is quite feasible .",
    "the  disk is consistent with being perpendicular to the plane of the dust lane , and lying along the major axis of the large elliptical galaxy ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pacont ] ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the large gas / dust disk of cen a ( i.e. the dust lane ) was acquired in a recent merger process , and that differential precession has led to the observed warped structure ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the central region of cen",
    "a , the precession time is only  years , and the orthogonal alignment of our small disk may be consistent with numerical studies of the evolution of gas disks in bulge systems ( e.g. @xcite ) . if we thus interpret the observed emission as being from the warped outer portions of an accretion disk around the active nucleus , we conclude that even on the relatively small spatial scale of a few parsecs , the disk is dominated by the gravitational potential of the galaxy as a whole and not by the symmetry of the agn and its jet .    for a non - rotating black hole ( bh )",
    ", one would expect the jet to have its direction determined by the angular momentum axis of the inner gaseous disk , while for a kerr black hole , it would be expected to be aligned along the spin axis of the black hole itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "close to a kerr bh , ( @xmath28gm / c@xmath29@xmath11 cm @xmath11 pc ) , the disk itself will warp to become normal to the spin axis . in our cen a data , on a few parsec scale , the normal to the  disk and the radio jet are misaligned by @xmath11 70 , in projection .",
    "we conclude that if cen a contains a rotating black hole , then either the gas disk must be outside the sphere of influence of the black hole , or it was formed recently enough that it has not yet become aligned with the spin axis ; for a non - rotating black hole , we find that the disk must become significantly warped away from being normal to the jet inside a radius of @xmath112pc .",
    "@xcite has recently modeled self - induced warping of accretion disks in agns .",
    "he finds that disks are likely to be warped at @xmath30pc around a @xmath11  bh .",
    "our results show a constant position angle for the disk in to @xmath11 2pc , suggesting the somewhat weak upper limit of @xmath11 for the mass of the black hole .",
    "three of the relatively strong  features detected appear spatially associated with the x - ray / radio jet of centaurus a. in figure [ fig : radio ] we overlay the  image with a 6 cm radio map ( feigelson , private communication ; see also figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we align the two images assuming that the radio and nir nuclei are coincident and note that the extended n - s extent of the radio contours is the result of the @xmath31 radio beam .",
    "the kiloparsec scale x - ray / radio jet has an average pa = 55@xmath67 , the innermost knots have a slightly larger pa@xmath160  and the vlbi milliarcsecond jet and counterjet ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) are at pa@xmath151@xmath63 .",
    "we note that the multiple components of the radio jet within a few arcseconds of the nucleus were not resolved by @xcite and were reported as n1 .",
    "they are clearly visible in the contour map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] ) and figure 1 of clarke et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , as part of their 6  nuclear jet , although the individual components were not discussed .",
    "we label the compact , innermost knot n1a and see that it corresponds positionally with the  `` finger''@xmath109 from the nucleus at pa @xmath32 ( see also the small inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : pacont ] ) .",
    "the two  arcs a and b , at distances of @xmath129 and @xmath135 from the nucleus , each extending over @xmath33 pc , are seen to lie @xmath1 15 and 30 pc , respectively , on either side of another knot of the nuclear jet .",
    "these may result from an outgoing shock created by interaction between the radio emitting nuclear ejecta and a gas cloud .",
    "we note that the radio jet has a steep spectrum at this distance from the nucleus ( @xcite ) , suggesting that the gas is still too hot along the jet axis to show line emission .",
    "we can expect , with adequate resolution , to see x - ray emission from this region of the jet .",
    "we summarize the key results of our 2.2 @xmath5 m continuum and   observations of the inner region of ngc 5128 as follows :    \\1 ) we see an extended continuum source with the rather regular and smooth structure expected for an elliptical galaxy .",
    "this smoothness contrasts strongly with the filamentary structure observed in the wf / pc i - band image .",
    "\\2 ) we identify a strong unresolved ( @xmath3401 ) central source as the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "its position is consistent with ground - based ir and radio data and the peak of reddening and polarization found with wf / pc-1 .",
    "the nucleus has an intensity of ( 2.3@xmath60.1 ) erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 @xmath8 based on our continuum observations , and a flux of ( 5.7@xmath60.6 ) erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 in .",
    "\\3 ) we see a prominent elongated structure in centered on the nucleus , with a major to minor axis ratio of @xmath2 , extending @xmath0along position angle @xmath1 33 , perpendicular to the dust lane .",
    "we interpret this as an inclined @xmath3 parsec diameter thin nuclear disk of ionized gas .",
    "the disk , with a radius of @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath35pc at 3.5 mpc , is among the smallest ever observed at the nucleus of an agn in the optical / near - ir .",
    "it is significantly smaller than the hundred or more parsec stellar disks presumed to exist at the centers of many galaxies .",
    "even at this small scale , the disk is not perpendicular to the jet .",
    "it is , however , consistent with being perpendicular to the dust lane and oriented along the major axis of the bulge .",
    "if it represents the warped outer portion of an accretion disk around the active nucleus , we conclude that even a few parsecs from the nucleus , the disk is dominated by the galaxy gravitational potential and not by the symmetry of the agn and its jet .",
    "further nicmos observations are planned in 2@xmath5 m polarized light and [ feii ] to provide emission mechanism diagnostics and determine the geometry of the nuclear radiation field .",
    "if a warped disk illuminated by the nucleus is the correct model , systematic changes in the polarization angle as a function of disk position should be seen .",
