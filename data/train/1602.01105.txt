    "the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of galaxies , including the milky way and m31 , reveal a remarkable correlation with galaxy halo mass .",
    "the correlation has a slope consistent with unity so that the ratio of the total gc system mass ( m@xmath3 ) to the total halo mass ( m@xmath4 ) is roughly constant with a value of a few times 10@xmath5 over 5 orders of magnitude ( blakeslee et al . 1997 ; spitler et al . 2008 ; spitler & forbes 2009 ; georgiev et al . 2010 ; harris et al .",
    "2013 ; hudson et al . 2014 ; durrell et al . 2014 ; harris et al .",
    "the scatter of the correlation is about 0.3 dex ( e.g. harris et al . 2015 ) .",
    "this near linear relation may simply reflect the gas content of a given dark matter halo at the time of gc formation and is close to the scaling predicted by kravtsov & gnedin ( 2005 ) of m@xmath6 from their cosmological simulation . over cosmic time",
    ", it is expected that the ratio m@xmath3/m@xmath4 is reduced due to gc destruction ( katz & ricotti 2014 ) . for further discussion of these issues",
    "we refer the reader to harris et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "the gc systems of large galaxies also reveal a bimodal colour distribution that is well represented by blue and red subpopulations .",
    "this bimodality is in turn thought to reflect differences in metallicity ( brodie et al .",
    "2012 ; usher et al .",
    "2012 ) . based on spatial distributions , metallicities and kinematics , previous gc studies",
    "have generally associated the red / metal - rich subpopulation with the stellar bulge / elliptical component of galaxies , and the blue / metal - poor subpopulation with the halo ( forte et al .",
    "2007 ; forbes et al . 2012 ; pota et al .",
    "2013 ; forte et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the currently popular two - phase scenario for early - type galaxy formation ( e.g. oser et al . 2010 ) ,",
    "the halo is largely built up by stars formed ` ex - situ ' in lower mass satellites which are later accreted . however , as well as an accretion origin , gc system metallicity gradients observed in a few well studied galaxies suggest that some blue gcs may have formed ` in - situ ' along with the bulk of the red gcs ( harris 2009 ; forbes et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it is thus important to investigate which gc subpopulation ( i.e. blue or red ) correlates with the dark matter content of a galaxy . in the largest study to date ,",
    "harris et al .",
    "( 2015 ) split some 300 gc systems into blue and red subpopulations , and examined the correlation with halo mass ( derived from a weak lensing study and a statistical relationship between stellar and halo mass ) .",
    "they found the blue gcs to have a slope close to unity , with the red gcs revealing a significantly steeper slope .",
    "both subpopulations revealed similar scatter .",
    "one limitation of past work is that gc systems , which have a radial extent of about ten r@xmath7 ( the half - light radius of the galaxy starlight ) , have been compared to halo masses which are measured on scales of the virial radius or @xmath0100 r@xmath7 .",
    "it is unclear whether the relation holds for spatial scales that are better matched ( although see kavelaars 1999 for an early investigation ) , and in particular if the red / blue gc fractions vary with the enclosed dark matter fraction or the enclosed dark matter mass .",
    "such a connection between gcs and dark matter on comparable scales is plausible because gcs are very old ( e.g. forbes et al . 2015 ) and formed during the early phases of collapse of their host dark matter halos .",
    "the gcs should therefore be preferentially associated with the central regions of present - day dark matter halos ( diemand et al .",
    "2005 ) , rather than with the total halo mass , whose late - time growth may be dominated more by `` pseudo - evolution '' than by true infall ( diemer et al .",
    "2013 ) .    here",
    "we use recent dynamical estimates of the dark matter content of individual early - type galaxies at radii comparable to their gc systems . in particular , we examine the dark matter on both a fixed spatial scale of 8 r@xmath7 and on a scale that matches the maximum extent of each gc system .",
    "our sample consists of massive early - type galaxies with high quality gc system imaging and estimates of their enclosed dark matter content .",
    "also for the first time , we use dynamical estimates of the dark matter mass rather than statistical scaling relations in the comparison with gc system mass .",
    "the galaxy sample for this work comes from the sluggs survey ( http://sluggs.swin.edu.au ) of nearby early - type galaxies ( brodie et al .",
    "the survey focuses on both the galaxy starlight and the gc systems of the galaxies .",
    "the galaxies cover a range of environments from the field to central dominant cluster galaxies .",
    "all have stellar masses greater than 10.3 in the log , and so probe the high mass end of the u - shaped number of gcs per unit stellar mass relation ( forbes 2005 ; peng et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we take total ( i.e. the pressure - supported mass plus the rotation mass ) galaxy mass estimates from the recent work of alabi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) who applied the tracer mass estimator ( tme ) eq .",
    "26 of watkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to some 3500 gc radial velocities under the assumption of isotropic orbits .",
    "these velocities were obtained mostly with the keck telescope and the deimos multi - object spectrograph .",
    "the tme gives galaxy mass estimates that are within a factor of two compared to those published using x - ray gas , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , and stellar kinematics for the same galaxies at the equivalent radius .",
    "here we include mass estimates from alabi et al .",
    "for the 16 sluggs and 1 bonus galaxy for which the gc data all reach at least 8 r@xmath7 .",
    "the mass of each gc system is based on the number of gcs which is sourced mainly from the imaging compilation of harris et al .",
    "( 2013 ) supplemented by some more recent wide - field imaging studies ( blom et al . 2012 ; usher et al .",
    "2013 , kartha et al .",
    "2014 , 2015 ) .",
    "the sample and data used in this work are summarised in table 1 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we also show in fig .",
    "3 the predicted blue gc fraction based on the findings of harris et al . ( 2015 ) . first , we estimate the halo mass for each galaxy in our sample using the m@xmath8m@xmath4 relation of behroozi et al .",
    "next , we use the f@xmath9m@xmath10 relation from harris et al . to predict the blue gc fractions for our galaxies , given their halo mass ( using eq . 3 of harris et al . ) . in fig .",
    "3 we show this average predicted blue gc fraction versus the average enclosed dark matter fraction we measure for our sample ( given by a star symbol ) .",
    "the predicted blue gc fraction agrees nicely with our empirical trend .",
    "the trend in fig.3 also appears to be consistent with the gc systems of dwarf galaxies .",
    "such galaxies are thought to be strongly dark matter dominated at large radii , and have blue gc fractions of approaching unity , i.e. they often contain no red gcs ( peng et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we now discuss the two deviant galaxies in fig . 3 and whether their location in the plots might be spurious .",
    "two effects may explain the deviation of ngc 4526 from the general trend .",
    "firstly , it has the highest correction in our sample for kinematic substructure ( alabi et al .",
    "uncorrected it would have @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "it also had a fairly large correction applied by peng et al .",
    "( 2008 ) as the gc system is not fully covered by the acs field - of - view , i.e. uncorrected @xmath13 = 0.48 .",
    "if either of these corrections were not applied then ngc 4526 would be consistent within the errors with the general trend .",
    "thus we suspect that ngc 4526 is not a true outlier and will obey the general trend with improved data .",
    "ngc 4494 deviates most strongly from the general trend .",
    "given that there appears to be a minimum , or floor , in the blue gc fraction of galaxies of f@xmath9 @xmath14 0.4 , changes to the blue gc fraction will not place ngc 4494 on the general trend .",
    "so we turn our attention to its low dark matter fraction .",
    "indeed we are not the first to find a low fraction of dark matter .",
    "several studies using pne to model the mass of ngc 4494 have derived a remarkably low dark matter content of @xmath150.5 within 5 r@xmath7 ( romanowsky et al . 2003 ; napolitano et al . 2009 ; deason et al . 2012 ) however , the more recent nmagic modelling of the extended stellar kinematics ( foster et al . 2011 ) and the pne data by morganti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found a higher dark matter fraction of f@xmath16 = 0.6 @xmath17 0.1 within 5 r@xmath7 .",
    "they assumed a logarithmic potential for the dark matter rather than an nfw - type profile , which leads to a higher dark matter mass and a relatively low stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the wide range of dark matter fractions in the literature suggest that ngc 4494 is difficult to model dynamically , and future mass modelling should attempt to incorporate stellar , pne and gcs velocity information simultaneously .",
    "if ngc 4494 follows the general trends for blue gc total mass ( figures 1 and 2 ) and blue gc fraction ( figure 3 ) found in this work , then a significant dark mass and dark matter fraction is expected .    a possible explanation for the overall correlation seen in fig .",
    "3 is the process of halo growth via accretion of satellites . as galaxies accrete low - mass satellites they will also accrete dark matter and ( preferentially ) blue gcs .",
    "this tends to move a galaxy up and to the right in the plot .",
    "the data points in fig .",
    "3 have been coded by their stellar mass . in the two - phase model for galaxy formation ( e.g. oser et al .",
    "2010 ) , the fraction of accreted ( ex - situ ) stars is a strong function of stellar mass . the plot shows a weak secondary trend for the highest stellar mass galaxies to have the highest dark matter fraction for a given blue gc fraction .",
    "this suggests that the accretion of many low mass satellite galaxies gives rise to a high ratio of dark matter to blue gcs in the outer regions of the most massive galaxies ( amorisco 2015 ) .",
    "alternatively , galaxies may move down and to the left in this plot via tidal stripping . for a typical galaxy in our sample the 2d surface density profile of a gc system",
    "has a power - law slope of 2 . assuming spherical symmetry this corresponds to 3 in 3d . at large radii",
    "an nfw profile slope is also around 3 .",
    "thus both the gc radial profile and that of the dark matter may follow a similar slope .",
    "this suggests that once tidal stripping has removed the outermost dark matter , further stripping would remove blue gcs ( as they are more radially extended than the red subpopulation ) and dark matter in roughly equal proportion .",
    "tidal stripping of a galaxy with an initially high dark matter and blue gc fraction would move it down and parallel to the trend seen in fig .",
    "3 . thus both tidal stripping and halo growth via accretion may play a role in the correlation of blue gc fraction and enclosed dark matter fraction .",
    "using a sample of well - studied massive early - type galaxies , we compare the mass of their gc systems to the host galaxy s dark matter content on similar spatial scales for the first time . we find a strong correlation between the mass of the blue ( metal - poor ) gc subpopulation and the dark matter content within a fixed 8 r@xmath7 .",
    "an even stronger correlation is found when the radius for calculating the dark matter mass is matched to the spatial scale of the gc system .",
    "thus from careful imaging of a gc system , one can infer the enclosed dark matter mass to within a factor of two .",
    "the ratio of the gc system mass to that of the enclosed dark matter is nearly constant , and this can be understood in terms of the universal baryon fraction , the efficiency of gc formation and the radial profile of dark matter .",
    "we also find a tight correlation between the fraction of blue gcs and the enclosed dark matter fraction .",
    "gc systems appear to have a minimum blue fraction of 40 per cent , although a typical galaxy , with blue gc fraction of 60 per cent , has 86 per cent of its mass in dark matter ( and 14 per cent in stars ) .",
    "the dark matter mass of ngc 4494 has been debated in the literature , but based on our findings we support claims that it is heavy with dark matter . both halo growth and removal ( via tidal stripping ) may play some role in shaping this trend .",
    "we suggest that galaxies with the highest accretion fractions reveal higher dark matter fractions for a given blue gc fraction .",
