    "( [ model ] ) when modelling the present state of a given system .",
    "before we describe our algorithm , let us consider the following analogy .",
    "we are given a semi - infinite vertical chain of buckets .",
    "in the bottom of each one we can drill a small hole of various width by setting a function @xmath14 such that the @xmath1-th bucket has a hole of size @xmath14 . the first bucket , at the top of the chain ,",

    "our goal is to adjust both the flow of the water @xmath13 and the width of the holes @xmath14 in order to reach a target quantity @xmath98 of water for each bucket @xmath1 after a time @xmath99 .",
    "since the function @xmath14 has an infinite number of degrees of freedom , this means that for _ any _ @xmath13 we could find a @xmath14 respecting ( at least to a certain degree ) the target distribution .",
    "therefore , we must constrain @xmath13 first , having a few degrees of freedom , and then optimize @xmath14 accordingly .",
    "we thus initially set @xmath77 , as previously determined , and we evaluate the quality of our model for the evolution of the system as obtained with different choice of @xmath13 . initially assuming @xmath77 does not reduce the range of reproducible scale exponents @xmath100 ; all scale independent distributions can be modeled with appropriate @xmath13 . in the worst case scenario , @xmath13 has four degrees of freedom , but we remove one with our knowledge of the final population ( or total quantity of water ) which sets @xmath101 = @xmath102",
    ". we can further reduce the number of possible parameters through simple conditions ; for instance @xmath103 $ ] . for each tested @xmath13 , we use the previously defined model ( see eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) ) .",
    "the quality of a given model @xmath104 on the final empirical state @xmath105 is measured in terms of the number of individuals ( or water drops ) @xmath106 that were assigned the wrong share ( to the wrong bucket ) : @xmath107 while a logarithmic error ( i.e. @xmath108 - \\textrm{log}\\left[n_k(t_f)\\right]$ ] ) was also tested , but an absolute error proved to be more robust to the noisy tails of the distributions where the data falls to @xmath109 while the model falls to zero .",

    "[ pastresults ] vary in nature , age and distributions , our results seem to indicate that they follow qualitatively the same evolution .",
    "indeed , our results confirm the presence of both a delayed regime of temporal scaling and preferential attachment in all cases .",
    "point estimates ( maximum - likelihood estimation with temporal data ) of the relevant parameters are given on table [ table1 ] and are visually compared with our model ( which again does not require temporal data ) in fig .  [ pastresults](left ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because of the form @xmath120 , the complementary probability ( i.e. the probability that the @xmath7-th event is a growth event ) follows the same form with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this fact is highlighted with the case of imdb in fig .",
    "[ pastresults ] ; the oldest considered system .",
    "in fact , eq .   ( [ pt0 ] ) implies that @xmath13 is a decreasing function of time only as long as @xmath76 always increases . in the imdb , death events ( removal of certain individuals from the growth function )",
    "could be the cause of this effect , yet interestingly do not appear to affect the efficiency of our model . furthermore ,",
    "notice that imdb is not only the sole system for which @xmath13 is an increasing function , but also the only system for which @xmath14 has an initially non - linear behaviour .",
    "with hindsight , this initial regime of the growth function probably corresponds to the so - called _ star system _ : actors with little experience are far less likely to be chosen for a role than experienced actors .",
    "the system then accelerates the introduction rate of new actors to preserve its scale independence .",
    "while this interpretation is speculative at best , the fact remains that these effects are observed in the temporal data and that our model is able to extract them solely from the present distribution .",
    "in fact , with the exception of one much smaller system ( sexual data ) , the quality of our reconstruction of the past is surprisingly good considering that it requires no temporal data whatsoever .",
    "for instance , the digg user activity distribution led us to determine with very high precision that 25% of votes are due to new users 12 hours into the month , whereas this proportion falls below 2% by the end of the month .",
    "perhaps this is the crucial point : the results confirm that our model embodies intrinsic constraints of scale independence .",
    "these constraints appear to clearly define the possible paths that a system can follow .",
    "a snapshot of its present state is then sufficient to determine where it comes from and where it is heading .",
    "this naturally leads to a second question : can we use the _ reconstructed _ past of a system to _ predict _ its future ?",
    "to turn our model into a predictive tool is a simple matter .",
    "we first eliminate the statistical fluctuations present in the reconstructed growth function .",
    "these stem not from the form of the growth function itself but merely from the system s finite size and the stochastic nature of the dynamics .",
    "hence , these fluctuations must be eliminated by applying a linear fit to the asymptotic behaviour of the reconstructed @xmath14 .",
    "a prediction can then be obtained by iterating eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) from a chosen present state to a desired future time .",
    "we apply this predictive model to the largest databases , i.e. actor productivity in the imdb and user activities on digg .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ futureresults](top ) . by using the activity distribution on digg after only three days ( again without any temporal data , only the current activity distribution per user )",
    ", we can extrapolate the distribution over the period of a month .",
    "in contrast , assuming a constant birth rate ( as in classical preferential attachment @xcite ) would lead to a predicted final population of 475,000 users .",
    "our model correctly compensates for repeated traffic and predicts a population of 115,000 users ; closer to the correct value of 139,000 and missing only some sudden bursts of new user influx .",
    "this observation embodies the strength of our model and the importance of a time dependent birth rate .",
    "similar results are obtained for actor productivity on the imdb .",
    "quite remarkably , we reproduce the state of the system at year 2012 from its state at year 1974 . given that extrapolation is a delicate procedure , it seems not unlikely that these agreements are not coincidental . as a comparison , the classic preferential attachment model shown in fig .",
    "[ futureresults](bottom ) is incapable of discerning whether the scaling exponent of a system is increasing or decreasing with time .",
    "as this classic model ignores the temporal dependency introduced here , this certainly highlights the importance of linking the temporal and structural features of complex systems .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that our analysis is in no way restricted by the nature of the systems under study . considering that scale independent systems are ubiquitous in science and everyday life , but that temporal data on their growth is seldom available",
