    "studies of the nearest massive black holes ( mbhs ) offer unique insights into inflows and outflows in galactic nuclei .",
    "such mbhs can be investigated on a key , physically - defining scale .",
    "spherically symmetric , adiabiatic accretion is characterized by a bondi radius @xmath4 and accretion rate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mbh mass , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the density and sound speed of the thermal gas at @xmath9 . for the nearest galaxies @xmath10  pc , which can be spatially resolved by _",
    "chandra _ and allows @xmath11 to be inferred ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "jet - like outflows are a hallmark of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and are thought to be fueled by bondi - like inflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on scales of order @xmath9 or more ,",
    "such outflows can be traced by radio imaging of jets and lobes , and x - ray imaging of jet - induced cavities in the thermal gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on scales",
    "much less than @xmath9 , such outflows have only been traced using radio imaging ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this work focuses on the nearest billion - solar - mass bh , that hosted by the flattened early - type galaxy ngc3115 @xcite .",
    "a distance of @xmath12 mpc , a nominal bh mass of @xmath13 and a 1 @xmath14 mass range of @xmath15 @xcite are adopted . for a canonical radiative efficiency of @xmath16 ,",
    "the associated eddington luminosity is a quasar - like @xmath17  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "the mbh is embedded in a nuclear star cluster located at the photocenter of ngc3115 s stellar disk and cuspy bulge @xcite .",
    "table  1 gives the position of the galaxy photocenter .",
    "ngc3115 is hot - gas poor and its overall gas temperature , 0.4 kev , is atypically high compared to early - type galaxies with similar hot - gas contents @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that the gas temperature is 0.3 kev in a 4- 10 annulus and begins to rise at a radius of 4- 5 .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence for spatially resolving the bondi flow onto the mbh , with the flow characterized by @xmath18 ( 200 - 250  pc ) and @xmath19 m@xmath20 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this bondi radius is consistent with expectations given the uncertainty in the bh mass @xcite .",
    "a basic tenet of bondi accretion theory is that the flow is adiabatic , a situation that could be violated if heating mechanisms are in play near the mbh . here , we set the stage for examining the role of outflows that could potentially heat the flow toward the mbh in ngc3115 .",
    "we present new radio constraints on any outflows (   [ imaging ] ) and interpret those contraints within the context of other information on ngc3115 (   [ implications ] ) .",
    "we close in   [ summary ] with a summary and conclusions .",
    "ngc3115 was observed with the very large array ( vla ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in its a configuration on 2004 november 16 ut under proposal code at299 .",
    "a coordinate equinox of 2000 was employed .",
    "j1007 - 027 , at a position of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and with a one - dimensional position error at 1 @xmath14 better than 1 mas , was used as a phase calibrator .",
    "the switching time between it and ngc3115 was 490  s , with a switching angle of 5.6 . to avoid phase - center artifacts , the _ a priori _ pointing position for ngc3115 was about 0.2 south of the then - available _ chandra _ position .",
    "data were acquired in dual circular polarizations with a bandwidth of 0.1  ghz centerd at 8.4601  ghz ( 8.5 ghz hereafter ) .",
    "observations of 3c286 were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 3% .",
    "the net exposure time on ngc3115 was 5180  s.    the data were calibrated and imaged using release 3.3.0 of the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package @xcite .",
    "twenty - five of 27 antennas provided data of acceptable quality , with most of the data loss due to evla @xcite retrofitting activities .",
    "the casa task clean was used to form and deconvolve a naturally - weighted image of the stokes @xmath23 emission from ngc3115 .",
    "nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) @xcite was used for image analysis .",
    "figure  1 shows the image , which has an rms noise level of @xmath24  mjy  beam@xmath1 .",
    "a search within the ned/2mass error circle ( table  1 ) led to the detection of one source .",
    "a gaussian fit to that source in the image plane was made using the aips task jmfit . from this fit",
    ", the source was found to be compact with a diameter less than 0.17 and with an integrated flux density of @xmath25  mjy , where the quoted error is the quadratic sum of the 3% scale error and the error in the fit .",
    "the fit also yielded a position at 8.5 ghz with an error dominated by that due to the phase - referencing strategies ( table  1 , fig .  1 ) . with adequate signal - to - noise",
    ", structures as large as 6 could be represented in figure  1 .",
    "no extended structure was found .",
    "a vla image of ngc3115 at 1.4 ghz is also available from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ) survey of @xcite .",
    "near the 8.5 ghz position there is a weak detection at 1.4 ghz obtained on 2002 august 12 ut with a geometric resolution of 5.9 .",
    "because of the source s weakness , a parabolic fit in the image plane was made using the aips verb maxfit .",
    "this fit yielded a peak flux density of @xmath26  mjy  beam@xmath1 , only 2.9 times the local rms noise level .",
    "the fit also provided a position at 1.4 ghz with an error dominated by that due to the signal - to - noise ratio ( table  1 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "ngc3115 was also observed briefly at 1.4 ghz under proposal code at299 ; those data were calibrated and imaged but that image is not presented here because it had poorer sensitivity than the first image .",
    "from figure  1 , the 8.5 ghz detection of ngc3115 has a diameter less than 0.17 ( 8.4  pc ) .",
    "its flux density is consistent with the 3 @xmath14 upper limit of 0.33  mjy measured at 4.9 ghz by @xcite with a geometric resolution of 8.5 ( 420  pc ) , and thus on the bondi - zone scales @xcite shown in figure  1 .",
    "such photometric consistency implies that figure  1 is recovering almost all of the high - frequency emission within the bondi zone .",
    "the photometry being compared at 4.9 and 8.5 ghz is separated by 17 years . if this comparison is compromised by time variability , the case for the compact nature of the high - frequency emission",
    "would be strengthened .",
    "the available high - frequency data provide no evidence for extended radio emission within the bondi zone . in this circumstance the spectral index between 8.5 and 1.4 ghz can be usefully computed : it is @xmath2 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this index could be compromised by time variability over about two years but , again , such variability would strengthen the case for the compact nature of the radio emission .",
    "the compact , flat - spectrum radio source coincides astrometrically with ngc3115 s photocenter ( table  1 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "because of this astrometric agreement , table  1 refers to this source as the radio nucleus of ngc3115 .",
    "its luminosity is @xmath28  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite identified a pointlike _ chandra _ source close to the galaxy s photocenter ( and thus its mbh ) and surrounded by diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "other studies also suggest a pointlike x - ray source @xcite .",
    "after correction for stellar and thermal emission , @xcite find that the pointlike source has a hard spectrum , a 2 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath29  ergs  s@xmath1 and an eddington fraction of @xmath30 .",
    "table  1 gives the position of this nuclear x - ray source , cxo j100513.9 - 074307 , from release 1.1 of the _ chandra _ source catalog @xcite .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite note possible blending issues that could affect both the astrometry and photometry of this source . for this reason , the cited x - ray luminosity and eddington fraction",
    "are conservatively treated as upper limits ( @xmath31  ergs  s@xmath1 , @xmath32 ) and table 1 refers to this source as the candidate x - ray nucleus of ngc3115 .",
    "the compact , flat - spectrum radio source coincides astrometrically with ngc3115 s candidate x - ray nucleus ( table  1 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "a study of radio and x - ray sources in low - luminosity agns found that the majority are radio loud , defined as @xmath33 or higher @xcite .",
    "that study involved radio sources with flat or inverted spectra , so the cited definition applies equally well at 8.5  ghz as at 5  ghz .",
    "for ngc3115 , @xmath34 , implying it is radio - loud .",
    "as conservatively estimated above , the eddington fraction of the mbh in ngc3115 is @xmath35 .",
    "this is remarkably small given that @xcite find that the bondi inflow onto the mbh is characterized by a substantial accretion rate of @xmath19 m@xmath20 yr@xmath1 at a radius of @xmath18 ( 200 - 250  pc ) .",
    "could this inflow be somehow impeded , limiting the fuel supplied to the mbh ?",
    "indeed , the density slope inferred by @xcite led them to suggest that the accretion was being suppressed near the mbh .",
    "the compact , flat - spectrum and radio - loud nature of many low - luminosity agns has been demonstrated to arise from outflows on parsec scales ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the radio nucleus of ngc3115 is compact , has a flat spectrum and is radio - loud , so it could plausably support an outflow on parsec scales .",
    "mechanical feedback from such an outflow could heat , and thus impede , the bondi inflow characterized by @xcite . to be most effective",
    ", the parsec - scale outflow should be poorly collimated , curved and/or bent , traits often seen among low - luminosity agns @xcite .",
    "for example , the iconic low - luminosity agn in the early - type galaxy ngc4278 has long been known to feature flat - spectrum and radio - loud emission on parsec scales ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "notably , @xcite recently concluded that the distorted , parsec - scale jets in ngc4278 play a key role in heating the ambient medium in this early - type galaxy .",
    "our discovery of compact , flat - spectrum and radio - loud emission from ngc3115 sets the stage for future radio imaging using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "knowing the radio structure of ngc3115 on parsec scales , its potential for heating the ambient medium can be quantified .",
    "it is also possible that the inflow is heated by stellar motions in ngc3115 s parsec - scale nuclear cluster , for which the innermost velocity dispersion reaches about 600 km  s@xmath1 @xcite . @xcite",
    "recently presented a theoretical study of this effect .",
    "such stellar - based heating could also influence the formation and propagation of outflows driven by the mbh in ngc3115 .",
    "for example , if it is difficult for the outflow to propagate then vlbi imaging could show emission confined to sub - parsec scales .",
    "a word of caution is in order .",
    "the flat - spectrum radio source in ngc3115 has an 8.5 ghz luminosity that is only about 290 times that of the flat - spectrum source sagittarius a@xmath36 , the radio nucleus of the milky way ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . that nucleus is about eight orders of magnitude underluminous compared to its eddington luminosity .",
    "there is an ongoing debate about whether the steady radio emission from sagittarius a@xmath36 traces an outflow , arises from the accretion flow itself , or involves both phenomena ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , at these low radio luminosities , outflows could be entirely absent and unavailable for heating .",
    "structural information on parsec scales could help distinquish between these two scenarios for ngc3115 , further underscoring the need for vlbi imaging .",
    "such imaging could reveal either elongated structures that are outflow driven or pointlike emission from the accretion flow near the mbh . in the interim ,",
    "the radio photometry presented here can help constrain models of the emission from the outflows and/or inflows in the vicinity of the billion - solar - mass bh in ngc3115 .",
    "we analyzed archival 8.5  ghz vla observations from the a - configuration of the nucleus of ngc3115 and detected , for the first time , compact emission ( diameter @xmath37 8.4  pc ) with a luminosity of @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1 . the compact radio emission in ngc3115 is spatially coincident with the optical center of the galaxy as well as the candidate x - ray nucleus .",
    "in addition to the 8.5  ghz detection , we found a weak detection in the first image at 1.4  ghz and showed that the emission has a flat radio spectrum , with a spectral index of @xmath38 .",
    "we compared the 8.5  ghz and 2 - 10 kev luminosities and found that ngc3115 is radio - loud , with @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite recently reported a _",
    "_ detection of a centrally - rising gas temperature gradient in the nucleus of ngc3115 , and cited this detection as evidence of spatially resolved bondi accretion onto the mbh on scales of 200 - 250  pc with @xmath40 m@xmath20 yr@xmath1 .",
    "however , this substantial bondi accretion rate is at odds with the extremely low eddington fraction of @xmath35 , suggesting that heating within the nucleus of ngc3115 may be impeding the bondi inflow .",
    "as has been established in other low - luminosity agns , the radio - loud nature of ngc3115 could be the result of a parsec - scale outflow capable of heating the ambient gas and starving the central mbh .",
    "the high - velocity stellar motions in the parsec - scale nuclear star cluster in ngc3115 also have the potential to heat the central gas , possibly hindering the accretion of material onto the mbh and confining any outflows to sub - parsec scales .",
    "alternatively , pointlike radio emission could also arise from the accretion flow itself .",
    "future , sensitive vlbi observations are needed to distinguish among these possibilities .    this research has made use of data obtained from the _ chandra _ source catalog , provided by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) as part of the _ chandra _ data archive .",
