    "finally , we examine the best fit of distance modulus for our theoretical models and the supernova type ia union2 sample and we found that for low redshifts @xmath183 , all the parameterizations are efficient enough to explain the observational data in the bd cosmology .",
    "+ the concluding lines in a nutshell should be : in bd theory , while all the observational data supported values of hubble s parameter , dark energy , dark matter , radiation densities etc have been considered in an closed universe with a potential proportional to the square of the scalar field present inside it , if the scalar field is proportional to the square root of the scale factor of the universal expansion , we get almost negative eos - s for the fluid present inside the universe ( for three particular fluids with redshift parametrizations of their eos ) . unlike the other gravity theory results we do not get a closed @xmath151 confidence contour for the parametric values ( considering the redshift parametrization ) .",
    "we get a open curve , tendency of which says it is preferable to get negative parametric values which ultimately would evolve negative eos strictly indicating the negative pressure inside the bd universe .",
    "inclusion of a scalar field has such an impression upon the inside - fluid s eos that in spite of being confined inside a short region , infinite values of eos are likely to have .",
