    "[ e_perfect ] while a disordered pattern has more modes excited and @xmath236 .",
    "conceptionally for anisotropic patterns , like undulations , the pattern entropy is even better suited to characterize disordered pattern than in isotropic systems .",

    "further characterization of the relative order of the pattern is possible using the correlation length @xmath238 in the transverse ( @xmath239 ) direction obtained from the half - width at half - maximum of the spatial autocorrelation functions , as demonstrated in fig .",

    "in fact , at higher @xmath13 the system visits alternately ou and uc states , and we observed a number of instances where the system remained in the ou state for more than 500 @xmath245 . because ordered patterns have few defects and chaotic patterns have many , one expects these measures to be correlated with each other .",
    "indeed , the number of defects @xmath246 exhibits behavior mirroring that of @xmath206 while @xmath240 is negatively correlated .",

    "the data at @xmath241 is more strongly correlated .",
    "the transition to increasing order , i.e. the appearance of long - living ou states for @xmath249 is a peculiar one , in that the system does not remain in the new , ordered state but intermittently returns to the chaotic state . to characterize this transition we measured the quantities @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 at each @xmath13 , shown in fig .",
    "[ f_ordereps ] . all four plots exhibit sudden changes near a transition point @xmath254 .",

    "no hysteresis was observed across this transition .",
    "note that this transition also corresponds to qualitative changes in the defect dynamics as previously described in @xcite .",
    "the analyses presented above are not specific to undulation chaos .",

    "[ e_perfect ] ) : @xmath264 consequently the local wavenumber analysis now applied to @xmath265 yields @xmath262 .",
    "for weakly disordered ou the periodicity of @xmath265 is in fact governed by @xmath266 . for @xmath267 , eq .",
    "[ e_bcmodulus ] reduces to @xmath268    fig .",
    "[ f_balloon ] shows sample wavenumber distributions of @xmath175 for the experimental convection patterns cells together with the stability islands from fig .",
    "[ f_moons ] .",
    "the mean values of @xmath269 ( the small circle ) are in the stable regime .",
    "we previously observed the mean value of @xmath181 to be proportional to @xmath270 , where @xmath176 agrees with the galerkin prediction for the onset of ou @xcite .",
    "the mean roll wavenumber @xmath133 does not vary significantly with @xmath13 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ f_balloon]a shows that the distribution of the @xmath271 values overlaps with the stability regions in a wide range , and the most probable value ( circle ) is within the stable regime .",
    "near defects , the undulation patterns are strongly deformed and local wavenumbers can be pushed outside the stability regions .",
    "further insight arises from distributions of the amplitudes @xmath170 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 . for an ideal undulation pattern characterized by the wavenumbers @xmath269 we also know the amplitudes @xmath170 and @xmath168 according eq .",
    "[ eq : ampli ] . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f_balloon]b the ratio @xmath272 varies significantly with wavenumber .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that a disordered pattern with a fairly wide range of @xmath269 values ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_balloon ] ) is characterized by a broad distribution of the amplitudes @xmath273 as well .",
    "we determined @xmath170 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 from the local maxima and minima of the experimental @xmath265 . due to the presence of defects it is not feasible to keep track of the phases of the cosine functions in eq .",
    "[ e_bcmodulus ] . since @xmath274 results in @xmath275",
    "we have chosen the convention @xmath276 in all cases .",
    "our analysis is independent of @xmath260 and @xmath262 and is not sensitive to the tilt in the undulations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_ratioeps ] , the median value of @xmath277 is observed to be low ( 0.2 ) near onset and rise with @xmath13 . for small @xmath13",
    "the peak in @xmath278 is near the ideal ou value @xmath279 . with increasing @xmath13",
    "the intermittently - visited uc states are responsible for an increasing asymmetry @xmath186 , which is then reflected in the average ratio in fig .  [ f_ratioeps ] as well .",
    "the averages of the ratios @xmath272 and @xmath280 shown in fig .",
    "[ f_ratioeps ] are obtained from a sequence of the corresponding distribution functions examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_ratiohist ] .",
    "we observe that the distributions become slightly more narrow at the higher @xmath13 , which might indicate the increased prevalence of ou .",
    "one feature not relevant for the present analysis is a weak drift of the experimental patterns down the cell @xcite .",
    "this is also the reason that undulations are mostly invisible in the time - averaged image shown in fig .",
    "[ f_homog]b .",
    "we associate the drifting behavior with non - boussinesq effects , which combined with the effect of the basic shear render the growthrates of @xmath281 of the oblique modes in eqs  .[e_amplb ] and [ e_amplc ] complex . between @xmath28 and @xmath241",
    "a drift speed of about @xmath282 has been measured , which is is substantially smaller than the value @xmath283 observed above @xmath7 .",
    "the difference may be partially accounted for by the strength of the shear flow , which is greater for steeper inclinations .",
    "the central topic in this paper is the competition between ordered ( ou ) undulations and undulation chaos ( uc ) .",
    "the galerkin analysis of the obe demonstrates the existence of linearly stable undulation patterns above the wavy instability up to fairly large @xmath13 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_moons ] the wavenumbers @xmath269 , which characterize the three dominant modes @xmath140 ( eq .  [ e_perfect ] ) cover a finite region in @xmath284-space , which is maximal near @xmath202 .",
    "the linear stability of ou is confirmed by direct simulations of the obe when starting from a galerkin solution with noise ( see fig .",

    "[ f_simexppics]a ) , albeit after a long transient .",
    "in contrast , at larger @xmath13 the system seems to remain in a uc state that competes with regions of ou ( see fig .",
    "[ f_simexppics]b ) . within the spatial and temporal limitations of our simulation we are unable to determine whether we observe uc as a long - lived transient or as a truly asymptotically selected state .    in the experiment",

    "the situation is different ( see fig .",
    "[ f_order]d ) .",

    "[ f_orderchaos]a . on the other hand ,",
    "the system can remain for long times in either of these states , switching intermittently between them .",
    "we interpret this scenario as reflecting the competition between ou and uc states .",
    "defects distort the patterns and can easily lead to the regions of the cells where part of the the wavenumber distribution lies outside the stability regions .",
    "the creation of defects and their dynamics is a well - known mechanism allowing the system to return to the stable regime . in the optimal case , this is achieved when oppositely charged defects annihilate each other or move to the boundaries .",
    "this process takes time and is susceptible to imperfections in the cell ( particularly the boundaries ) , but there are also cases ( such as sdc , @xcite ) where the system never settles down to the stable attractor but switches intermittently back and forth between almost perfect ordered and strongly disordered states as in our case .",
    "in this paper we have studied an anisotropic pattern forming system which shows spatiotemporal complexity .",
    "in contrast to the similar and previously studied scenario of the electrohydrodynamic instability in nematic liquid crystals @xcite , the basic equations are simple enough to be amenable to a precise theoretical analysis .",
    "we demonstrate the crucial importance of topological defects in the competition between chaotic and well - ordered patterns .",
    "while numerical simulations demonstrate stable ordered undulations at all @xmath13 above the secondary instability , such a state is only intermittently accessible in experiments .",
