    "the aim of this work is to propose an explicit scheme for the teleportation of an unknown two - mode entangled state of continuous variables from one party ( alice ) to the other distant party ( bob ) . for this purpose",
    "we first show how an entangled state of four modes can be generated and shared by alice and bob with the help of linear amplifiers and beam - spitters .",

    "bob has two amplifiers ta1 and ta2 and two beam - splitters bs1 and bs2 using which he generates a four - mode state ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "he keeps two of these modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 with himself , and sends the remaining two modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 to alice . using the beam - splitters bs3 and bs4",
    "alice combines her modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 with those sent by bob , and performs four measurements on the output modes @xmath7 .",
    "she then communicates her results to bob who uses these to apply a unitary transformation to displace the modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the final teleported state is found in the modes @xmath8 and @xmath9.,width=302 ]    [ f1 ]    our protocol is as follows .",
    "let alice hold the source parametric amplifier sa3 whose two output entangled modes are to be teleported .",
    "bob possesses two teleportation amplifiers ta1 and ta2 which are required as compulsory accessories for our protocol of teleportation of two - mode entangled states .",
    "alice s task is to teleport the entangled state of the modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 as signal and idler originating from her sa3 to bob .",
    "but prior to this one requires to set up a four - mode entangled state to be shared by alice and bob . for this purpose , consider the modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 coming out of the amplifier ta1 , and the modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 coming out of ta2 .",
    "the covariance matrix of the four modes @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , and we assume that the two amplifiers are similar , i.e. , @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the squeezing parameter and @xmath21 the amplifier phase .",
    "bob uses two beam - splitters ( bs1 and bs2 ) represented by the matrix @xmath22 as @xmath23 where , @xmath24 is a @xmath25 identity matrix , to mix the modes ( @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "the cm corresponding to the four output modes ( @xmath0 ) of the two beam - splitters are given by @xmath28 bob then supplies the modes @xmath4 and @xmath3 to alice and keeps the remaining modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 with himself .",
    "hence , alice and bob share a four - mode entangled state to be used for the teleportation protocol .",
    "alice has the two entangled modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 originating from her source amplifier sa3 to teleport , in addition to the two modes @xmath4 and @xmath3 which bob has sent her .",
    "the combined six - mode state ( four modes with alice and two with bob ) are represented by the cm @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the squeezing parameter of the two - mode state ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) with alice , and @xmath35 being the phase of amplifier sa3 .    to proceed further with the teleportation protocol , alice uses two beam - spiltters bs3 and bs4 represented by @xmath36 to combine the modes ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath3 and @xmath6 ) , respectively in order to obtain the four output modes ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "alice then makes measurements on these four modes . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume that her choice of measurements leads to the results ( @xmath37 ) , respectively , which she communicates to bob .",
    "bob then uses these measurement results to displace the state of the modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 with him , by applying the unitary transformation @xmath38 to obtain finally the modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the gains @xmath39 on the classical measurements have been chosen such that the resultant matrix @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 defined below ) has all the elements either @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the combined physical processes ( the beam splitters used by alice , the measurements performed by alice , and the unitary transformation performed by bob ) takes the cm @xmath45 to @xmath46 where @xmath47 incorporates the measurements made by alice .",
    "note that the measurements on the four modes @xmath48 with the choice of outputs @xmath49 that we have made , corresponds to integrating out these variables , and hence in the cm ( [ measure ] ) the corresponding rows are deleted .",
    "thus , the teleported signal and idler can be found as the modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 with bob , represented by the cm @xmath50 where @xmath51 the cm @xmath52 can also be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the @xmath56 identity matrix . for @xmath57 , and in the limit @xmath58 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath59 .",
    "it can be shown that the gaussian state with cm @xmath60 and the gaussian state with cm @xmath61 are equivalent under local linear unitary bogoliubov operations ( llubos)@xcite .",
    "thus , in the limit of ideal input squeezing , the two - mode eintangled state is teleported perfectly .",
    "further , if the output states from the amplifiers ta1 and ta2 are coherent states , i.e. , @xmath62 , then the variances of the modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are increased by twice the level of the vacuum noise . thus our teleportation protocol in this special case reproduces the results obtained by tan@xcite for a scheme of teleporting a single - mode state .",
    "for the final teleported state is plotted versus the squeezing @xmath34 of the two - mode state generated from the source amplifier sa3 ( @xmath63-axis ) , and the squeezing @xmath20 of the two two - mode states from the teleportation amplifiers ta1 and ta2 , respectively ( @xmath64-axis).,width=340 ]    [ f2 ]    in order to check that the teleported modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 indeed represent an entangled pair , we compute the symplectic eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the cm @xmath52 given by eq.([covmat5 ] ) . for the modes @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 to be entangled , the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath65 has to be less than one@xcite , i.e. , @xmath66 . for simplicity , we assume that the phase of the amplifier sa3 is chosen such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and similarly , the phases of ta1 and ta2 are such that @xmath69",

    "one sees that the magnitude of entanglement of the teleported output two - mode state obtained by bob goes up with increased squeezing of the states coming from both the source and the teleportation amplifiers .",
    "is plotted versus the squeezing @xmath34 of the state to be teleported ( @xmath63-axis ) , and the squeezing @xmath20 of the output modes of the amplifiers ta1 and",

    "we plot the fidelity of teleportation versus the squeezing parameters in fig.3 .",
    "we notice that a maximum fidelity of @xmath81 is possible in this scheme for an initial two - mode coherent state generated by the source amplifier .",
    "the fidelity stays nearly constant with variation of the squeezing of the states from the teleportation amplifiers .",
    "thus coherent states generated by the teleportation amplifiers can also be used to implement this protocol . however , increased squeezing of the initial state from the source amplifier leads to the loss of fidelity .",
    "the latter feature is in sharp contrast to the magnitude of entanglement of the final two - mode state with bob , which increases with the increase of squeezing of alice s two - mode state .",
    "this result seems to support the contention of johnson et al.@xcite that the average fidelity may not be a good indicator of the quality of quantum teleportation .",
    "though their results were obtained in the context of teleportation of single modes together with the physical transport of modes between three parties@xcite , it might be more appropriate to use the measure of ` entanglement fidelity'@xcite to quantify , where possible , the ability of a process to preserve entanglement .",
    "to summarize , we have presented the first explicit protocol for teleportation of two - mode entangled squeezed states .",
    "our scheme is accomplished by the creation of a four - mode state shared initially by two distant parties through beams generated by two teleportation amplifiers and combined by two beam splitters .",
    "teleportation takes place with the usual local measurements , unitary operations and the classical communication of four bits parallel to the case involving entangled states of discrete variables@xcite . if coherent states from teleportation amplifiers are used to create the four - mode state shared by the two parties for enabling teleportation , the variance of the entangled two - mode teleported state increases by twice the level of the vacuum noise . in general , the entanglement obtained for the teleported state increases with the squeezing of the initial two - mode state which however leads to loss of fidelity of teleportation",
