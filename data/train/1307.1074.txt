    "the experimental and theoretical investigation of ultracold atomic gases involving highly excited rydberg states has recently attracted a great deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "one reason is that the strong interactions between rydberg atoms can dramatically influence the laser excitation process ( rydberg blockade effect ) , giving rise to intriguing new many - body phases and strong spatial correlations between the atoms  @xcite .",
    "for example , chirping the excitation laser field may enable the formation of new crystalline states of rydberg atoms  @xcite . or , by weakly admixing rydberg character to ground states with off - resonant laser light it might be possible to introduce new types of interactions between dressed atoms  @xcite .",
    "the rydberg blockade effect can likewise influence the formation of ultracold plasmas , where spatial correlations between rydberg atoms prior to their ionization may enable the production of ultracold plasmas in the strongly - coupled regime  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the strong rydberg ",
    "rydberg interactions can also have a back - action on the laser fields coupling to the rydberg state .",
    "very recently , electromagnetically induced transparency using rydberg states was shown to create effective interactions between photons  @xcite , paving the way to the generation of high - repetition - rate sources of nonclassical light as a resource for quantum information processing or for nonlinear optics involving ultracold rydberg gases  @xcite .    to fully explore these new prospects ,",
    "modern rydberg atom experiments require a high level of experimental sophistication in both preparation and detection of the excited atoms .",
    "high atomic densities and flexible trapping geometries are a key ingredient , providing large optical densities to enhance nonlinear optical effects , and are used to introduce and control collective many - body effects . additionally , the development of sensitive detection techniques is required to study the physics of strongly - correlated rydberg interacting systems , providing direct access to their microscopic details .    in this paper",
    "we describe in detail our experimental system tailored for the investigation of strongly - interacting rydberg gases and the detection of atomic correlations .",
    "in addition to good electric field control , our experiment offers faster experimental cycle times , better magnetic field control , and better optical access as compared to the system recently detailed by r. lw _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this is possible through the use of a high flux 2d - mot cold atom source and a three - beam optical dipole trap .",
    "the latter allows for varying the atomic density over three - orders of magnitude , including all - optical preparation of @xmath0rb bose - einstein condensates , and for generating quasi - one - dimensional and three dimensional rydberg systems .",
    "a special electrode structure is used to control electric fields and to field ionize rydberg atoms for detection , without limiting the optical access .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section ii contains a detailed description of our experimental apparatus , focusing on the special features used to study rydberg - interacting quantum systems . in section iii",
    "we review two experiments performed in the strongly - interacting regime using this apparatus : the spontaneous formation of an ultracold plasma from a rydberg blockaded gas  @xcite , and the emergence of correlations between dark - state polaritons in rydberg state electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite .",
    "we start by reviewing the technical details of our experimental apparatus .",
    "laser cooling and the used trapping techniques which are common to many ultracold atom experiments are described in detail in reviews by w.  ketterle _ et al . _",

    "we focus specifically on the key features of our experimental system ( fig .",

    "the primary goal is to maximize optical access to the atoms , while providing excellent electric field control .",
    "the latter is a main requirement of any rydberg apparatus , because rydberg atoms are extremely sensitive to electric fields  @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms experience large dc - stark shifts @xmath1 , since their atomic polarizability @xmath2 scales with the seventh power of the principal quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 state has a polarizability of @xmath5  @xcite , while the lifetime limited transition linewidth is only @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "thus , a small electric field of @xmath7 can shift the rydberg state by several hundred linewidths . on the other hand ,",
    "moderate electric fields can be used to manipulate rydberg atom properties , including the use of frster tuning of interactions  @xcite or spatially resolved excitation using inhomogeneous electric fields  @xcite .",
    "another important consideration is stray fields , caused for example by the presence of a few spurious ions  @xcite . to minimize this possibility we isolate the cold atom source from the main experimental chamber to eliminate ions emitted from the alkali metal dispensers . for this",
    "we use a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( 2d - mot ) , which loads a 3d - mot in the main science chamber  @xcite . since the cooling mechanism and hence the transmission through the differential pumping tube are exclusive to the designated neutral atomic species , the source is ion free , while providing high atom fluxes which are comparable to zeeman slowers .",
    "further advantages of the 2d - mot are that it does not reduce optical access to the science chamber and that it provides a slow atomic beam with small divergence and high beam luminosity which sets the basis for experiments with high repetition rates .",
    "once the 3d - mot is loaded from the cold atom beam , the pre - cooled atoms are directly transfered into an optical dipole trap ( odt ) .",
    "we use all - optical evaporative cooling , in order to precisely control the density and temperature of the atoms and to produce a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) if required . compared to magnetostatic traps  @xcite ,",
    "optical dipole traps are unrestricted to the used spin states and allow for almost instant trap switch - off .",
    "furthermore , they minimally affect the optical access to the atoms and their operation is technically less demanding than hybrid optical and magnetic traps  @xcite .",

    "this serves to map the properties of the rydberg states onto the probe light field , providing a local probe of the system and the possibility to analyze hundreds of eit - systems in parallel ( mapped onto hundreds of pixels ) , each with different parameters , within a single experimental run . by combining eit - based imaging with field ionization detection",

    "the optical dipole trap ( odt ) is designed as a horizontally oriented three beam trap and spatially overlapped with the 3d - mot using a geometry which provides a large trapping volume and tight confinement . to fulfill these seemingly incompatible requirements , we decouple the loading from the evaporation process using a separate reservoir and dimple trap  @xcite .",

    "not only simplifies the crossing alignment but also allows for dynamical power balancing of the two intersecting reservoir arms through the radio frequency power .",
    "for a typical laser power of @xmath42 in each reservoir beam the trap depth is @xmath43 .",
    "most importantly the crossed geometry leads to a significant enhancement of confinement along the symmetry axis of the reservoir . a dramatic consequence of this is illustrated in fig .",

    "in dense samples , ionizing collisions between rydberg atoms can produce an ion cloud which traps electrons produced during later collisions .",
    "subsequently the trapped electrons rapidly collisionally ionize the remaining rydberg atoms , resulting in an ensemble of unbound charged particles , referred to as an ultracold plasma  @xcite .",
    "this spontaneous evolution of a rydberg - interacting gas to an ultracold plasma has been observed in several experiments  @xcite , providing a novel approach to study ultracold plasmas .",
    "ultracold plasmas constitute an ideal laboratory system to model exotic phases of matter such as laser - induced plasmas  @xcite , dense astrophysical plasmas  @xcite or even quark gluon plasmas  @xcite .",
    "research in this field is fueled by the potential to access the so - called strongly coupled regime , in which the coulomb interaction energy exceeds the kinetic energy of the ions , giving rise to many - body effects and strong spatial correlations between particles  @xcite .",
    "this regime is quantified by the coulombic coupling parameter @xmath154 here , the charge and the temperature of the plasma constituents are given by @xmath155 and @xmath77 , respectively , while @xmath156{3/(4 \\pi \\rho ) } $ ] is the wigner - seitz radius , which characterizes the separation between particles in a plasma of density @xmath157 .",
    "to date ultracold plasmas with @xmath158 have been realized  @xcite .",
    "however entering deep into the strongly coupled regime has remained out of reach despite the ultralow temperatures possible with laser cooling .",
    "rapid temperature rises were observed during the plasma formation , which is partly attributed to the initially random distribution of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "this disorder - induced heating arises when the coulomb interaction energy of the initial spatial distribution is converted into kinetic energy of the ions , posing one of the primary limits to the attainable coupling strengths in current experiments .",
    "one solution to overcome disorder - induced - heating , is to produce the plasma from a rydberg blockaded sample , in which the constituent particles are spatially ordered , with the probability to find close - by pairs strongly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this approach is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:5_plasma_mechanism ] and works as follows : ( i ) an initially randomly distributed gas of ultracold neutral atoms is excited to _ repulsively interacting _ rydberg states via a continuous and doubly resonant two - photon laser coupling .",
    "( ii ) due to the rydberg blockade , each rydberg - excited atom blocks further excitations within the blockade radius leading to spatial correlations , resembling those of a strongly coupled plasma  @xcite .",
    "after a short time , the rydberg density reaches steady state , while at later times rydberg atoms start to decay through a combination of blackbody photoionization  @xcite and ionizing collisions  @xcite , both leading to a successive increase of charged particles .",
    "( iii ) once a critical number of ions has accumulated the resulting space charge starts to trap subsequently produced electrons . at this critical time @xmath159 , rapid electron ",
    "rydberg collisions trigger an ionization avalanche , which ultimately produces an ultracold plasma .",
    "interestingly , the plasma forms rapidly compared to the motional timescales of the ions , since the avalanche is triggered by the fast moving electrons .",
    "therefore the original density  density correlations of the rydberg gas should be preserved , which is expected to significantly reduce the effects of disorder - induced heating  @xcite .",
    "we have recently performed experiments along these lines , in which we observed the spontaneous ionization dynamics for rydberg gases of different densities at temperatures around @xmath160  @xcite .",
    "this was possible by independently measuring the number of ground state atoms , rydberg atoms , and ions within the sample via the combination of absorption imaging and ionization detection .",
    "evidence for the ionization avalanche deep in the blockade regime is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:5_plasma_mechanism](c ) , which shows the number of plasma ions as a function of excitation time . for an atomic density of",
    "@xmath161 we witness a sharp increase of plasma ions around @xmath162 , which is strongly density dependent .",
    "we observe that repulsive rydberg  rydberg interactions delay the ionization avalanche by several micro seconds .",
    "we found that the typical plasma formation time scales are around @xmath163 , which is short compared to the motional dynamics of the ions . during this time the ions only move by approximately 600 nm , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the length scale imposed by the blockade radius @xmath137 .",
    "this suggests that the initial correlations should be preserved in the plasma phase , putting the production of strongly coupled ultracold plasmas within reach .",
    "recent molecular dynamics simulations for a gas of sr atoms by g.  bannasch _ et al . _",
    "predict that field ionization of a pre - structured rydberg gas would suppress the effects of disorder - induced heating by more than an order of magnitude , giving rise to coupling parameters of up to @xmath164 ,  @xcite .",
    "future studies of these systems will benefit from independent tuning of plasma parameters through appropriate choice of atomic densities , rydberg quantum numbers and laser detunings .",
    "this would provide the means to reveal a proposed universal scaling between the coupling parameter @xmath165 and the number of rydberg blocked atoms  @xcite or to explore the phase diagram of ultracold plasmas including strongly coupled liquid phases and liquid - vapor phases  @xcite .      for high densities",
    "the number of rydberg excitations in the gas should be determined by the maximum number of blockade spheres that fit into the excitation volume . therefore , the total number of rydberg excitations saturates and is only subjected to small fluctuations between consecutive experimental runs .",
    "this can be seen in the statistical number distributions of rydberg excitations which changes from poissonian to sub - poissonian character in the transition from the weakly - interacting to the strongly - interacting regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : statistics](a )  &  ( b ) ) @xcite .",
    "this crossover can be quantified by the mandel @xmath166 parameter  @xcite @xmath167 where @xmath168 denotes the number of rydberg atoms .",
    "values of @xmath169 correspond to super - poissonian , @xmath170 to poissonian and @xmath171 to sub - poissonian fluctuations .",
    "the latter corresponds to a narrowing of the rydberg excitation number distribution .",
    "the extreme case , a number- or fock - state is characterized by the total absence of fluctuations with @xmath172 .",
    "therefore the @xmath166 parameter is an excellent measure for the effectiveness of the rydberg blockade on the many - body system .",
    "the mandel @xmath166 parameter can also be related to the spatial correlation function @xmath173 of the rydberg atom distribution by @xmath174 d^3r\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath175 being the rydberg density in the excitation volume  @xcite . even though ( [ eq : q_correlation ] ) is only valid for homogeneous densities and isotropic interactions , it nonetheless underlines the fact that sub - poissonian counting statistics are intimately connected with the emergence of spatial correlations , reflected by @xmath173 . statistical methods for observing the transition to strongly - correlated or even crystalline states have recently been discussed in a number of theoretical papers  @xcite .",
    "we recently reported experimental measurements of sub - poissonian statistics of dark - state polaritons ( dsps ) propagating in a gas of rydberg - dressed atoms  @xcite .",
    "dsps arise under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite , in which a strong optical control field @xmath119 renders an otherwise absorbing medium transparent for a weak probe field . at the few photon level",
    ", eit can be described by the propagation of individual dark - state polaritons , which simultaneously possess the properties of both the photonic and the atomic degrees of freedom , which can be interchanged in a fully coherent and reversible way  @xcite .",
    "the dsp wave function for a single probe photon can be written as @xmath176 where the collective quantum states involving @xmath78 atoms and the light field are    [ eq : collective states ] @xmath177 @xmath178    the mixing ratio @xmath179 determines the properties of the polariton depending on the atom density @xmath157 , the resonant scattering cross - section @xmath180 , the speed of light in vacuum  @xmath181 , the decay rate @xmath112 of the intermediate @xmath182 state , and the coupling rabi frequency @xmath183 .    in our experiments , @xmath184 and the dsps are almost entirely matter - like with @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , measuring the rydberg population serves as a projective measurement of the number of polaritons inside the cloud .",
    "this is achieved through single - atom sensitive detection of the rydberg population which gives direct access to the matter part of the polariton wave function inside the atomic cloud .",
    "rydberg interactions give rise to an effective interaction blockade for dsps , which we observe as a transition from poissonian to sub - poissonian statistics for the polariton number , indicating the emergence of spatial and temporal correlations between dark - state polaritons .",
    "figures  [ fig : statistics](c )  &  ( d ) show a comparison of the statistical distributions for low and high polariton densities corresponding to low and high atomic densities . for low atomic densities of @xmath186 , we obtain a distribution compatible with a poissonian distribution and mandel q parameter of @xmath187 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : statistics](c ) ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath188 , we observe a substantial narrowing of the polariton number distribution , with @xmath189 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : statistics](d ) ) , where the experimental uncertainties have been estimated using the bootstrap method .",
    "the true distribution ( @xmath190 ) is even narrower as one also has to take into account the ion detection efficiency @xmath191  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the rydberg  rydberg interactions give rise to significant spatial correlations between dsps .",

    "polariton interactions mediated by the atomic admixture can lead to highly nonlinear  @xcite and nonlocal optical effects  @xcite , which allow the engineering of novel photonic many - body states . by detuning from the intermediate state , the dissipative character of the effective polariton ",
    "polariton interactions can be suppressed while maintaining the giant nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "this would give rise to elastic scattering of dsps , providing means to implement deterministic photonic quantum logic gates  @xcite .",
    "as the nonlinearity can be controlled via the choice of the rydberg state , repulsive , attractive and long - range interactions would become possible  @xcite",
    ". this could pave the way to create and study new types of quantum gases such as dipolar bose - einstein condensates of dark - state polaritons  @xcite . the ability to produce and coherently control the propagation of quantum fields using interacting dark - state polaritons will open up new applications including few - photon nonlinear optics  @xcite , nonclassical light sources  @xcite and photonic quantum logic gates  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new experimental system for the investigation of many - body effects in dense ultracold gases of rydberg atoms .",
    "the setup combines high atomic densities with excellent control of external fields and precise rydberg atom detection .",
    "fast experimental duty cycles are made possible using a high flux 2d - mot followed by efficient evaporative cooling in an optimized three - beam optical dipole trap , which allows for the production of all - optical @xmath0rb becs .",
    "we have described a specially designed electrode structure for electric field control and field ionization and detection of rydberg atoms .",
    "this was then used to study the effects of correlations induced by rydberg ",
    "rydberg interactions in two vastly different physical regimes .",
    "the first study exploited rydberg  rydberg interactions as a means to imprint spatial correlations into an otherwise randomly arranged gas .",
    "subsequent formation of an ultracold plasma was evidenced by a rapid avalanche ionization , suggesting a new route to the production of strongly coupled plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the second study used measurements of the counting statistics to reveal temporal and spatial correlations between rydberg - interacting dark - state polaritons . here field ionization measurements served as a projective measurement of the polariton wave function inside the rydberg medium  @xcite .    in future experiments field ionization of rydberg states , as described here , could be combined with optical probing of rydberg states using absorption imaging under eit conditions  @xcite ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_total ] ) .",
    "the combination of both techniques will provide information about rydberg state populations and optical coherences with spatial resolution  @xcite , thereby giving dynamical access to macroscopic and microscopic properties of the system .",
    "another future goal will be to explore strongly - correlated phases at the single particle level and with high spatial resolution .",
    "with this in mind we recently proposed a new imaging technique exploiting the large level shifts induced by a rydberg impurity atom on a background gas of atoms , that is coupled to an auxiliary rydberg state via an eit resonance  @xcite .",
    "associated with this is a new characteristic radius within which the impurity  probe interactions destroy the transparency , thereby changing the optical properties for many atoms surrounding each impurity .",
    "this method should make it possible to image individual rydberg atoms with high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "this technique is fundamentally nondestructive , thus allowing for time - resolved images of many - body dynamics and can be implemented in existing experiments .",
    "numerous applications of this imaging technique can be foreseen , for example the possibility to directly image the formation ( and melting ) of crystalline states  @xcite .",
    "other studies could aim at spatially resolving individual dark - state polaritons propagating through the eit medium and to directly reveal the nonlocal character of the optical nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the ability to exploit rydberg  rydberg interactions to control both light and atomic fields , and to image the resulting new quantum phases will open a new chapter of rydberg physics with many new and intriguing possibilities .",
