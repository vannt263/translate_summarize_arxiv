    "accretion disks are one of the most ubiquitous astrophysical objects , comprising dynamics such as astrophysical jets , disk winds , and particle acceleration .",
    "it is widely believed that these dynamical phenomena are driven by the anomalous transport of angular momentum and the subsequent release of gravitational binding energy .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed in attempts to explain the origin of this angular momentum transport .",

    "in order to study the basic behavior behind the non - linear time evolution of mris , most numerical studies on the local properties of mri - induced turbulence have adopted the shearing box model @xcite , which can capture the wave vector toward an arbitrary direction in a differentially rotating plasma .",
    "since an mri with a vertical wave vector has the maximum growth rate for an axisymmetric perturbation when the background magnetic field is purely poloidal , fully three - dimensional simulations , or at least two - dimensional ones including a vertical axis , are necessary .",
    "( note that the final states in two- and three - dimensional cases are rather different from each other , and that the three - dimensional simulations are required to investigate the saturation stage . )",
    "the situation is similar when the unperturbed magnetic field is purely toroidal . for exapmle",
    ", @xcite investigated the linear stability of an accretion disk threaded by a uniform toroidal magnetic field assuming three - dimensional wavevectors in the cylindrical coordinates , whose @xmath2-component varies with time because of the background shear velocity .",
    "they showed that the perturbation satisfying @xmath3 can become unstable , in the sense that the amplitude of oscillation increases with time .",
    "moreover , a finite vertical wavenumber , @xmath4 , is required for the instability to occur , and the larger @xmath4 leads to the faster amplification .",
    "the non - linear evolution of this oscillatory instability was also examined by @xcite using three - dimensional ideal mhd simulations , and the contribution to turbulence generation was confirmed .",
    "other examples include linear eigenvalue analyses and the corresponding mhd simulations by @xcite .",
    "they revealed that purely growing eigenmodes can exist in a shearing plasma , in contrast to the above oscillatory unstable modes .",
    "for a keplerian disk , only the non - axisymmetric perturbations with @xmath5 become purely growing modes , where @xmath6 and @xmath4 are the azimuthal and vertical wavenumbers , respectively . the vertical waves ,",
    "therefore , again contribute to the unstable modes most significantly , although a finite azimuthal wavenumber is required .",
    "such a situation , where the toroidal magnetic field is dominant , is thought to appear easily in the non - linear stage of an mri even when starting from a poloidal field . for understanding the dynamics and the nature of turbulence in well - developed disks , therefore ,",
    "it is important to investigate a plasma stability under a purely toroidal field . in this paper",
    ", we provide the results of linear and non - linear analyses on this issue , focusing particularly on an initially non - uniform toroidal field , and suggest another possible path leading to turbulence generation .",
    "unstable modes proposed here , which we will call  magneto - gradient driven instability ( mgdi )  reflecting its driving source as shown in the suceeding sections , are confined within the equatorial plane , i.e. , @xmath7 , in contrast to the previous studies that required @xmath8 .",
    "an instability bound to the equatorial plane may play a crucial role in plasma transport , as it could potentially couple with magnetic reconnection occurring in the plane and contribute to the saturation mechanism of mris .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : linear ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the setup of our theoretical study and show the existence of unstable eigenmodes by linear analysis .",
    "section [ sec : nonlinear ] discusses the results of the fully - non - linear two - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "the non - linear calculations corresponding to the linear study and ones which can lead to more turbulent states are presented .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary and conclusion of our results .",
    "in this section we investigate the linear stability of a non - uniform toroidal magnetic field in a differentially rotating system . in",
    "particularly , a simplified situation with a localized toroidal magnetic field channel is considered to extract the physical essence of possible unstable modes .",
    "the ideal mhd equations incorporated with the standard shearing box model are employed as the basic equations throughout this paper @xcite : @xmath9 the radial and azimuthal directions are then interpreted as the @xmath2- and @xmath10-axes in the local cartesian coordinate system , where the differential rotation is described by a linearly changing background velocity defined as @xmath11 , using an angular velocity at the center of the computational domain , @xmath12 , and a positive constant , @xmath13 .",
    "the specific heat ratio , @xmath14 , is set to be 5/3 , and the other notations are standard .",
    "when a purely toroidal magnetic field is imposed , the background shearing plasma is kept in an equilibrium state as long as the total pressure is spatially constant .",
    "we can , therefore , choose an arbitrary magnetic structure with a finite gradient .",
    "here , we focus on the idealized case with a simple localized toroidal field , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the field strength at @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the typical width of the localized field . the gas pressure is determined so as to satisfy the total pressure balance , and the background density is distributed so as to keep the temperature uniform .",
    "next , we linearize the mhd equations around this equilibrium state , assuming the functional form of a small perturbation as @xmath19 the vertical dependence is ignored so as to pick up horizontally confined modes . using the vector potential instead of the magnetic field",
    ", the linearization of the basic equations leads to the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a first - order perturbation vector , and @xmath22 is a coefficient matrix whose components are given as follows , @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 , \\\\     d_{21 } & = & -iv_{y0}^{\\prime}-2i\\omega , \\\\     d_{41 } & = & -ip_0^{\\prime}-i\\gamma p_0\\partial_x .    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath26 is the identity matrix , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 indicate differentiation operators by @xmath2 . note that the equations for @xmath29 and @xmath30 are decoupled as usual shear alfvn waves .",
    "although the density perturbation , @xmath31 , appears to have disappeared from the basic equations , compressional modes remain in the system and @xmath31 can be obtained from @xmath32 .",
    "finally , equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) is discretized in the computational domain @xmath33 with 400 grid points using a fourth - order central difference .",
    "the width of the localized field is set to be @xmath34 . as a boundary condition",
    ", a conducting wall is assumed at @xmath35 .",
    "the eigenvalues , @xmath36 , and the eigenvectors , @xmath37 , are then computed numerically .      from our calculations of the eigenvalue problem described above",
    ", we obtained one growing mode for the mgdi at most for each particular wavenumber value .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig:1 ] , where the color contour shows the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues as a function of the wavenumber , normalized by the width of the localized field , and the plasma beta , @xmath38 , measured at @xmath17 .",
    "note that the real parts are zero in a machine precision .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] indicates that the purely growing mode appears if @xmath39 is lower than about 100 , and that the growth rate becomes larger as the initial magnetic field strength increases .",
    "when @xmath39 is equal to unity , the maximum growth rate reaches @xmath40 , which is comparable to that of the axisymmetric mri , i.e. , @xmath41 , as far as the linear approximation is appropriate .",
    "we should emphasize here that the magnitude of the velocity shear , @xmath13 , is assumed to be unity in figure [ fig:1 ] for theoretical simplicity , which is smaller than in the case of keplerian rotation , where @xmath42 . in the keplerian rotation case",
    ", we expect more unstable eigenmodes due to the stronger shear motion",
    ".    a physical picture of the mgdi can be explaind as follows .",
    "let us consider an outward going perturbation in @xmath43 away from @xmath17 , i.e. , positive for @xmath44 and negative for @xmath45 . since a linearized equation for the azimuthal magnetic field can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a lagrangian derivative , such outward @xmath43 directly induces the increment in @xmath48 through the second term in the right - hand side .",
    "this term comes from the linearized advection effect , which represents the fact that a fluid element brings the frozen - in magnetic field line from the original position with the stronger magnetic field . on the other hand , a lienarized version of the equation of motion for",
    "the radial velocity is as follows , @xmath49 the second and third terms in the right - hand side represent the magnetic pressure gradient and the magnetic tension force , respectively .",
    "the magentic pressure can be further decomposed into two contribution from @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the increase in @xmath48 , then , leads to further expansion force via the first component of the magnetic pressure , which implies a positive feedback",
    ". this feedback process will continue to work as long as the finite gradient in the background magnetic field is available .    as well as the growth rates",
    ", the range of unstable wavenumbers also tends to broaden as the plasma beta decreases , especially toward the long - wavelength side .",
    "the smallest scale , on the other hand , seems to always be limited roughly by @xmath52 , which corresponds to the wavelength one order of magnitude larger than @xmath18 .",
    "this bound could be understood qualitatively by the competition between the magentic pressure gradient force , which is a driver here , and the magnetic tension force working as a restoring force . for the feedback mechanism described above to occur ,",
    "it is clear that the expansive nature of the magnetic pressure needs to be greater than the tension effect .",
    "these promoting and restoring effetcs can be rearranged into the form of the lorentz force , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the schematic view of the situation is illustrated in fig.[fig : force ] .",
    "thenm the condition that the expansive term outpaces the restoring force is roughly estimated as @xmath55 replacing the derivatives by typical scales like @xmath56 and @xmath6 , we obtain the estimate , @xmath57 , which is consistent with the unstable range in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the destabilization mechanism described above seems not to be related to the nature of the differential rotation . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "growth rates in a rigid - rotating plasma are shown in figure [ fig:2 ] with the same format as in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "this panel indicates the existence of unstable modes over a similar range to that in the differentially - rotating case .",
    "the qualitative dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath39 also resembles that in figure [ fig:1 ] , but the magnitude of the growth rate becomes smaller by a factor of 2 for @xmath58 , and much more for larger @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that this instability arises originally from the gradient of the magnetic field , and can attain a large growth rate comparable to that of the standard mri only when combined with the shearing motion .",
    "let us discuss the structure of the eigenfunctions .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows two - dimensional representations of the fourier decomposed eigenfunction , @xmath37 , superposed on the background equilibrium state , @xmath59 , where @xmath37 is normalized to satisfy @xmath60 . based on the normalized case in panel ( b ) , the states before and after twice the @xmath61-folding time are shown in panels ( a ) and ( c ) , respectively . the plasma beta and the wavenumber",
    "are chosen to be @xmath62 and @xmath63=0.223 , respectively , and the corresponding point on the @xmath6-@xmath39 diagram is plotted in figure [ fig:1 ] by an outlined circle . in each panel ,",
    "the color contour , the solid lines , and the vector field show the gas pressure distribution , the lines of magnetic force , and the bulk velocity , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows that bending of the field line broadens with time , and eventually spreads out beyond the typical width of the equilibrium field , @xmath34 .",
    "this broadening of the field line is explained by the destabilization process described in the previous subsection , i.e. , the outward magnetic pressure gradient exceeding the inward magnetic tension force may further expand the magnetic field explosively .",
    "in addition to the expansion in the @xmath2-direction , the field lines are also stretched in the @xmath10-direction by the so - called @xmath12-effect due to the background shear motion , and thus the magnetic field lines become inclined downward to the right .",
    "in other words , @xmath64 and @xmath65 tend to have negative correlation .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the mgdis have the potential to contribute to powerful angular momentum transport , making the averaged maxwell stress , @xmath66 , once developing to non - linear turbulence .",
    "other important features include vortex structures around the nodes of the magnetic field lines in panel ( c ) .",
    "in particular , the clockwise vortices at every other node , which align with the differential rotation , are selectively enhanced . since the coriolis force works rightward to the direction of motion ,",
    "the inside of the clockwise vortex is compressed , and the other is expanded . on the other hand",
    ", the selective enhancement makes the magnetic field lines loosened around the clockwise vortex , as if a tightly stretched rope is reeled up .",
    "this leads to the negative correlation between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure , which implies that the present unstable mode essentially arises from slow - magnetosonic waves .",
    "looking at figure [ fig:3 ] , one may associate the mgdis with current - driven instabilities ( cdis ) , which are thought to contribute fast dissipation of magnetic energy in various astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although the characteristic that both unstable modes are driven by magnetic non - uniformity is common , we consider the mgdi as a fundamentally different mode from the cdi . to make the difference clear , for example ,",
    "notice that the wavevector in the cdi is essentially parallel to the background electric current , which drives the instability .",
    "in the case of the mgdi , on the other hand , the background current has only an out - of - plane component , which is obviously perpendicular to wavevector of the perturbation .",
    "figures [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] show the eigenfunctions for the cases with @xmath39=10 and 1 , respectively , in the same format as in figure [ fig:3 ] . the wavenumber is again assumed to be @xmath63=0.223 .",
    "since the magnetic tension force , working as a restoring force , becomes stronger with an increase in the magnetic field strength , it becomes more and more difficult to bend the magnetic field lines significantly , and the unstable mode seems to be localized around the initial localized channel .",
    "it should be noted that the localization of the eigenfunction and its growth rate is a different matter .",
    "the growth rate actually becomes greater with the background magnetic field strength increased , as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , due to a large gradient of the field .",
    "this localization implies a small @xmath67 compared with the initial @xmath65 , but how it affects the average value of the maxwell stress is not trivial .",
    "the estimate of the efficiency of the angular momentum transport is tightly connected with the non - linear behavior and the problem of the saturation mechanism . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the significant contribution of the present instability to the stress tensor , using non - linear simulations .",
    "this section provides the results of fully - non - linear mhd simulations designed to validate the presence of mgdis suggested in the previous section and to investigate the non - linear time evolution . specifically , we focus on the efficiency of angular momentum transport",
    ".      we solve the same equations as used in the previous section , i.e. , from equation ( [ eq : linear1 ] ) to ( [ eq : linear4 ] ) , but rewritten in the semi - conservative form : @xmath68 @xmath69     = - 2\\rho{\\bf \\omega}\\times{\\bf v }      - 2\\rho \\omega x v_{0y}^\\prime \\hat{\\bf e}_x ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath70 @xmath71     = - 2 \\rho \\omega x v_{0y}^\\prime v_x ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the total energy density , and the other notation is same as in the linear analysis .",
    "the specific heat ratio is again set to be @xmath73 .",
    "all quantities are spatially discretized by using the finite difference approach in a computational domain , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which is resolved with 200@xmath76600 grid points .",
    "we calculate the flux with the help of the hll approximate riemann solver @xcite at the face center , where the primitive variables , i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , are evaluated as point values by combining a 5th - order weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) interpolation @xcite and the monotonicity preserving limiter @xcite .",
    "the point - value flux is then converted to the appropriate numerical flux with a 6th - order formula @xcite .",
    "the cell - centered conservative variables are finally updated using the 3rd - order tvd runge - kutta method @xcite . to avoid a spurious magnetic monopole , the hll - upwind constrained transport ( uct ; @xcite ) treatment",
    "is employed for updating the face - centered magnetic field , in which the edge - centered electric field is evaluated using weno interpolation and the hll average .",
    "note that the results to be shown in this section will not largely change , even if the hlld riemann solver , which is more accurate than the hll riemann solver especially in high-@xmath39 plasmas @xcite , is employed instead .",
    "the quantitative behavior of statistics , however , slightly differs due to the higher resolution of each wave mode .",
    "in particular , less diffusivity is preferable to larger stress related to turbulent motion in small scales .",
    "our initial condition is set to be a superposition of exactly the same equilibrium state considered in our linear analysis and a random perturbation of the in - plane velocity , the amplitude of which is fixed to 1% of the sound speed measured in an unmagnetized region . without the random perturbation ,",
    "the system would remain in the initial equilibrium state . to calculate the long time evolution of the system , we implement the standard shearing periodic boundary condition . even if one adopts a conducting wall boundary , the results do not change in the early stage , before the distorted magnetic fields approach the radial boundary .    from left to right in figure [ fig:6 ] , snapshots of the simulations with @xmath39=100 , 10 , and 1 taken at time @xmath81 are shown .",
    "the format of each panel is same as in figures [ fig:3 ] to [ fig:5 ] except for the range of the @xmath10-coordinates .",
    "all of these cases show the negative correlation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 reflected as the downward - sloping magnetic field lines , which contributes to angular momentum transport . while the linear theory discussed in the previous section",
    "predicts broadband growth for a stronger initial field , the typical scale of the bending of the field line is clearly larger for smaller @xmath39 , which suggests that the magnetic tension force works more efficiently in non - linear evolution and then the growth of short waves is suppressed . in larger @xmath39 cases , on the other hand , the bent mean structure and other small - scale magnetic structures appear .",
    "such structures first grow along the both sides of the initial field , where the large gradient @xmath82 exists , and then they are torn off from the mean field by magnetic reconnection .",
    "( note that magnetic reconnection occurs via numerical resistivity , but the non - linear evolution does not change by assuming a finite resistivity . ) in any case , the non - linear growth up to torsion of the localized magnetic field is ascertained .",
    "note that the stage where the linear theory is applicable finishes instantly , since the growing perturbed field quickly breaks the background structure of the initial magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] summarizes the box - averaged stress as a function of time .",
    "the @xmath83-components of the reynolds stress and the maxwell stress normalized by the initial gas pressure , or the so - called @xmath0-parameters , are plotted in each panel .",
    "the instantaneous reynolds stress generally fluctuates significantly with time , but the temporal average over the interval @xmath84 takes a positive value of the order of @xmath85 . the maxwell stress , on the other hand , remains positive during the non - linear evolution , which is still smaller by one to two orders of magnitude compared with the local three - dimensional simulations of mris ( * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "note that the case of @xmath62 shows a remarkably small value in spite of a more broken structure , due to the weakness of the initial field .    to put it another way ,",
    "however , once the magnetic field lines are stretched to the point of crossing the radial boundary , much stronger azimuthal fields could be expected .",
    "the point is a stretching term in the governing equation for the azimuthal magnetic energy , @xmath86 where the first and the second terms in the right - hand side represent the energy change by stretching and compressive motions , respectively .",
    "especially , the energy increase through the background velocity shear , @xmath87 , is called the @xmath12-dynamo . in a radially periodic system like the shearing box , if a fluid element moves largely across the radial boundaries , the total velocity shear the element feels can become much larger than the shear just inside one simulation domain , @xmath88 .",
    "the larger radial fluctuation , therefore , leads to the stronger azimuthal magnetic energy .",
    "the next subsection is devoted to suggesting such a possible path leading to a more amplified magnetic field and a resultant large maxwell stress .      as a phenomenon expected to occur in accretion disks ,",
    "let us consider the situation where a toroidal magnetic field has multiple structures rather than a single localized field .",
    "the motivation of this idealized setup comes from , for example , the existence of parasitic instabilities occurring on a current sheet , which induce periodic variation of plasma parameters along an equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism driving the instability in the linear stage does not change even in this case , but a more turbulent state could be expected in the non - linear stage as a result of coupling between neighboring fields .",
    "this section shows a possible path through which the mgdis may contribute to turbulence generation and anomalous angular momentum transport .",
    "the simulation setup is the same as described in the previous subsection except for the initial profile of the magnetic field .",
    "here we assume the functional form of the toroidal magnetic field as follows : @xmath89 which reproduces both the locality within @xmath90 and the periodicity of the localized structure .",
    "the pressure and density profiles are also modified to keep dynamical and thermal equilibrium .",
    "the plasma beta is defined using the peak value of the magnetic field , @xmath91 , and the gas pressure at the same site .",
    "figures [ fig:8 ] , [ fig:9 ] , and [ fig:10 ] show snapshots at characteristic stages in the cases with @xmath39=100 , 10 , and 1 , respectively .",
    "the three panels in each figure are taken at times @xmath92=5 , 10 , and 20 from left to right , and the format of each panel is the same as in figure [ fig:6 ] . in the leftmost panel in figure [ fig:8 ] ,",
    "we can see that the discrete magnetic field lines are distorted individually in the early stage by the non - linear growth , just as demonstrated in the simulations with a single localized field .",
    "the bending of the field lines grows as time goes on , and before ten orbital periods they drastically overlap and merge with the neighboring magnetic fields .",
    "the mixing of the magnetic field is completed by 20 orbital periods , and the simulation domain is filled with a lot of magnetic islands as a result of the repetitive reconnection process .",
    "recall that , in a single channel case , the reconnected field simply gets torn off the background field and shows no further turbulent development . at this stage , the energy contained in the magnetic field increases to about 10% of the kinetic energy of the background differential rotation .",
    "even if the difference of the initial magnetic energy is taken into account , this ratio is rather large compared with the case of a single localized field , where the magnetic energy at the saturated stage is smaller by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the detailed time history of the box - averaged energy is summarized in figure [ fig:11](a ) , which shows that the dynamo process works efficiently on both @xmath64 and @xmath65 at an early stage before 20 orbital periods , and roughly speaking , an equipartition is eventually attained between the kinetic energy in the @xmath2-direction and the magnetic energy in the @xmath2- and @xmath10-directions .",
    "the production of the strong azimuthal field is understood as a natural conseqence from equation ( [ eq : omega - dynamo ] ) , which tells the effect of @xmath12-dynamo .",
    "a similar relation holds with regard to the radial field energy as @xmath93 which shows that shear motion in the radial velocity newly generates the radial magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that in the mgdi this radial velocity is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force , while the gravity - related terms play the same role in the case of mri . in this sense , the dynamo process working here looks quite similar to that in the mri not only in the azimuthal field , but also in the radial field . at the saturated stage",
    ", the gas pressure gradually increases through magnetic reconnection , creating many magnetic islands .",
    "even when the initial magnetic energy is ten times as large , that is , @xmath94 , the same instability grows as shown in figure [ fig:9 ] . compared with the case of @xmath62 , it can be seen that the typical scale of the growing mode becomes larger , as does the size of the magnetic islands in the final stage .",
    "the gas pressure at 20 orbital periods increases about twofold , which implies that the total amount of energy input into the system across the boundaries is enhanced and continuously converted to the internal energy of the plasma through magnetic reconnection .",
    "in other words , the total stress integrated along the radial boundary gets larger , since the time variation of the total energy , @xmath61 , can be described as follows :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the total stress .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : ev ] ) , which represents the change in the total gravitational potential in the simulation domain , becomes nearly zero on average .",
    "the detailed time history of each energy component is plotted in figure [ fig:11](b ) . as in the case of @xmath62 shown in panel (",
    "a ) , the growing mode is saturated before 20 orbital periods , after which the kinetic energy related to @xmath97 and the magnetic energy reach a level comparable to the background differential rotation , but slightly larger than those in the case with a weaker initial field .    however , this situation changes significantly for the strong magnetic field with @xmath58 shown in figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "the initial equilibrium state holds and no growing mode can be observed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the non - linear evolution is accomplished in the single field case discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the energy history in figure [ fig:11](c ) also shows a quite calm variation .",
    "the suppression of the growing mode is indeed the result of the non - linear magnetic tension force , since we confirmed the presence of unstable modes in linear analyses under the initial magnetic profile described here .",
    "we summarize the time histories of the reynolds and maxwell stresses in figures [ fig:12](a ) and [ fig:12](b ) , respectively .",
    "the result of @xmath58 , denoted by the red line , shows no stress for either the reynolds or maxwell components , because the initial equilibrium state is almost conserved . in the cases with @xmath94 and 100 , denoted by the green and blue lines ,",
    "the reynolds and maxwell stresses averaged after 20 orbital periods are -0.00109 and 0.0235 for @xmath62 , and -0.0164 and 0.126 for @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the maxwell stress , therefore , is larger by about two orders of magnitude than the results in the single field case , which means a qualitative change in the non - linear behavior , rather than the simple quantitative superposition due to an increase in the initial total magnetic flux . in addition , the result for a stronger shear motion with @xmath42 , which corresponds to the kepler rotation , is also plotted as a cyan line . the basic mechanism driving the instability is same as in the case with @xmath98 , but thanks to the more powerful @xmath12-dynamo effect",
    ", the mgdi can grow more quickly non - linearly and a larger maxwell stress can be attained at the saturated stage .",
    "the @xmath39-dependence of the maxwell stress averaged during the saturated stage between @xmath99 is summarized in figure [ fig:13 ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the results are well fitted by a power law of @xmath100 as long as @xmath101 , which indicates the proportionality to the initial magnetic flux rather than magnetic energy density , while the cases starting with @xmath102 result in almost no stress .",
    "the suppression of instabilities for a small @xmath39 is highly relevant to the large characteristic spatial scale under the strong magnetic tension force , which works less efficiently for longer waves .",
    "although this mode has a broad unstable range in wavelength with respect to the linear theory around a single channel , the nonlienar growth is actually quenched in the mutiple channel case .",
    "once the simulation box is extended double in the azimuthal direction , however , the drastic growth in the maxwell stress via channel merging process is activated even for @xmath58 .",
    "this certainly heppens because the extended box allows the growth of the fluctuations with the scale larger than the original domain size .",
    "figure [ fig : longy ] shows the time histories of the reynolds and maxwell stress for @xmath39=1 , 10 , and 100 , respectively , normalized by the volume averages of the instantaneous thermal pressure , @xmath103 . from the right panel",
    ", we can clearly observe the enhancement of the maxwell stress by the nonlienar growth after 50 orbits for @xmath58 .",
    "except for the shifted time this drastic merging is switched on , the statistical behavior is quite similar in all cases , which implies that the mgdi works as the common underlying mechanism to drive the turbulence .",
    "in the present paper , we have proposed a new plasma instability , mgdi , which can generate a highly turbulent state in an accretion disk and contribute to the enhanced transport of angular momentum .",
    "driven by the spatial non - uniformity of a toroidal magnetic field , an unstable mode completely confined within the equatorial plane can be realized , in contrast to the previous studies on the toroidal mri , in which a vertical wavenumber always dominates over a finite azimuthal component .",
    "the growth rates and eigenfunctions of this instability are calculated by linear eigenvalue analysis , and the corresponding non - linear evolution is then demonstrated using two - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "while the simulations beginning with a single localized toroidal field reveal the non - linear growth of the mgdis , it is shown that the angular momentum transport does not work so efficiently in the saturated stage .",
    "if the instabilities occur in the neighboring field lines under the multiple localized magnetic fields rather than in an isolated situation , however , they drastically overlap with each other and a well - developed turbulent state can be realized . in such a case dynamo action by differential rotation begins to work efficiently on magnetic field lines crossing the radial boundaries , which contributes to a large maxwell stress .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that a toroidal field with a larger magnetic flux is favorable for the maxwell stress to reach a large value , but this drastic transition does not occur for a magnetic field that is too strong with @xmath102 , as long as we employ the box size @xmath104 . once the simulation domain is elongated , the transition is reactivated , but it takes much longer time to switch on the drastic merging .",
    "it is worth noting that the situation with @xmath105 , which is favorable to the growth of the mgdi , often appears during a non - linear phase in a local simulation of the mri for a relatively small initial beta , @xmath106 . in the cases with larger initial @xmath39 values , like @xmath107",
    ", the final states still seem to be in the unstable regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the profile of the toroidal magnetic field discussed here is one of the most idealized situations , the physical essence to drive the instability does not change even under a different structure , as long as an enough radial gradient of the magnetic field is available .",
    "there is , therefore , possibility that the present unstable mode will arise around various kinds of fluctuation in the toroidal field , like via parasitic modes including the kelvin - helmholtz instabitlity and the tearing instability .",
    "it should be emphasized again that the efficiency of the anglar momentum transport obtained here is comparable to that obtained in evaluation in three - dimensional simulations of mris assuming an initial toroidal field , in spite of the low dimensionality , and therefore , the mgdis are capable of driving strong turbulence alone .",
    "one might expect not just the sole contribution , but also coupling with magnetic reconnection occurring parallel to the equatorial plane during the nonlinear phase of mri , and with the toroidal mris as considered in previous studies if vertical variation is also taken into account .",
    "it is still not obvious that how large contribution the instabilities have in fully three - dimensional shearing boxes .",
    "nevertheless , since they provide new paths toward turbulence without any finite @xmath4 in contrast to the conventional toroidal mris , the complementary growth between toroidally and vertically propagating waves , rather than competitive growth , should be expected .",
    "the present instability could possess the ability to play a wide variety of crucial roles in the mechanism of turbulence generation in differentially rotating systems .",

    "<S> a new type of instability that is expected to drive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence from a purely toroidal magnetic field in an accretion disk is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is already known that in a differentially rotating system , the uniform toroidal magnetic field is unstable due to a magnetorotational instability ( mri ) under a non - axisymmetric and vertical perturbation , while it is stable under a purely vertical perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the previous study , this paper proposes an unstable mode completely confined to the equatorial plane , driven by the expansive nature of the magnetic pressure gradient force under a non - uniform toroidal field . </S>",
    "<S> the basic nature of this growing eigenmode , to which we give a name `` magneto - gradient driven instability '' , is studied using linear analysis , and the corresponding nonlinear evolution is then investigated using two - dimensional ideal mhd simulations . although a single localized magnetic field channel alone can not provide sufficient maxwell stress to contribute significantly to the angular momentum transport , we find that the mode coupling between neighboring toroidal fields under multiple localized magnetic field channels drastically generates a highly turbulent state and leads to the enhanced transport of angular momentum , comparable to the efficiency seen in previous studies on mris . </S>",
    "<S> this horizontally confined mode may play an important role in the saturation of an mri through complementray growth with the toroidal mhds and coupling with magnetic reconnection . </S>"
