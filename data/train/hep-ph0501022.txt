    "@xmath9 factories provides large samples of @xmath10 mesons allowing the study of physical phenomena such as cp violation , the determination of the ckm mixing angles and the search for new physics@xcite . clearly , hadronic physics will beneficiate of the high statistics achieved , and the study of processes with small branching ratios will be possible .",
    "the full understanding of the @xmath9 physics is still lacking as well as a systematic first principles description of the phenomena involved . instead different theoretical approaches are compared to data and assumptions such as factorization , or estimation of the relative size of different contributions ( tree level , annihilation , penguins , final state interactions ) can be tested .",
    "this can be achieved in processes where the dominant contributions are suppressed by symmetry or accidental cancellations .",
    "the babar and belle collaborations already reported precise measurements of non - leptonic @xmath9 meson decays involving scalar mesons with branching ratio of order as low as @xmath11 .",
    "thus for example , for the @xmath12 channel , besides the branching ratio the cp violating asymmetries are reported and , from the two pion spectrum , the authors are able to obtain the mass and width of the @xmath13@xcite .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath14 where branching fraction for given final states are reported -in particular @xmath15- however in this case it is not possible to separate the @xmath16 from the @xmath17 decays , unless a dominant decay mechanism is assumed@xcite . in this context",
    "it is worth remarking that the @xmath18 decay was suggested as a place where @xmath19 , the weak mixing angle , could be measured through the cp violating asymmetries @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that the @xmath20 is suppressed by @xmath21 parity and also by isospin , which implies that in the symmetry limit no cp violating asymmetry is expected to be experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "thus , theoretical arguments support the idea that the @xmath22 is strongly suppressed , so that the reported branching ratio can be identified with the dominant @xmath23 decay . as a by product , in   @xcite",
    "the author concludes that the positive identification of @xmath24 is an evidence against the four quark assignment of @xmath4 or else , for the breakdown of perturbative qcd . both , the suppression of the @xmath22 channel as well as the potential evidence in favor or against a four quark state are rather interesting observation that deserves further analysis .",
    "the low lying scalar sector of qcd represents a major challenge @xcite . from the experimental point of view , the determination of the nature of existing states has not been achieved while from the theory side no consistent interpretation of the experimental data exists @xcite .",
    "this is so even though a number of processes involving the appropriated final state in the kinematical region of interest have been analyzed .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath25 and central production involve the @xmath13 and @xmath26 @xcite , whereas the di - pion in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays include the kinematical region where the @xmath29 is expected to appear @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , although different processes are included in the analysis , data is not good enough to provide a clear picture of the scalars .",
    "in fact no consensus exist even on the fundamental intrinsic properties ( mass and width ) of the low lying scalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the appropriated theoretical description of non - leptonic @xmath9 decays involving scalar mesons is important not only to understand the nature of the scalars but also because these must be considered as background to other processes of interest in @xmath9 physics . since scalars , vectors and tensors couple to two pseudoscalars , the following decays lead to the same final state : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand for scalar , vector , spin 2 and pseudoscalar meson respectively .",
    "b decays involving scalar mesons have been considered by a number of authors .",
    "thus for example in @xcite the tree level hamiltonian and quark model calculation are used to predict branching ratios , while sum rules @xcite and gluon - penguin dominance @xmath34 are the basis to interpret the scalars produced in @xmath9 decays in terms of glue balls @xcite , or still using qcd corrected hamiltonian plus factorization @xcite to propose evidence for two quark content of the @xmath13 .    in this note",
    "we analyze the @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays using the factorization approximation . to this end",
    "we use the @xmath37 weak hamiltonian including qcd corrections to next to leading order . to evaluate the matrix elements we use values reported in the literature or model dependent estimates of the decay constants and form factors .",
    "in particular , the annihilation contribution is considered and evaluated using perturbative qcd .",
    "this is important in estimating contributions previously neglected , and it is also relevant to quantify the statement in @xcite regarding the four quark nature of the @xmath26 .",
    "following the conventional approach @xcite , we start with the @xmath40 effective hamiltonian @xmath41 @xmath42 + h.c.\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 are the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "the wilson coefficients , @xmath44 , including next to leading order qcd corrections , are evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath45 .",
    "we use the conventions and @xmath44 values reported in @xcite .",
    "it remains to evaluate the matrix elements between the states of interest .",
    "@xmath46    @xmath33 and @xmath47 stand for pseudoscalar and scalar meson respectively . in terms of the amplitude",
    "the branching ratio is given by : @xmath48    with @xmath49 the appropriated b meson lifetime @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix elements are evaluated using the assumption of factorization . in that approximation",

    "we quote the numerical values of the @xmath58 coefficients .",
    "these expressions are obtained by inserting the vacuum between the currents in all possible ways , and a typical @xmath59 product of matrix elements is parameterized in terms of form factors and decay constant as :    .numerical values for the effective coefficientes @xmath60 for @xmath61 transitions at scale @xmath62 ( for @xmath63 in units of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "at tree level the @xmath67 is strongly suppressed due to the absence of second class currents .",
    "to get an evaluation for such a decay an estimate of the contribution of the @xmath9 annihilation is necessary .",
    "the annihilation amplitude is proportional to @xmath68 which itself is proportional to the @xmath69 form factor . at the scale @xmath70 ,",
    "perturbative qcd provides an adequate framework to evaluate this form factor .",
    "so , below we compute this form factor using the standard approach of perturbative qcd @xcite assuming the scalar meson @xmath71 is a two quark state .    in order to fix the convention , we recall the form factor definitions :    @xmath72    with @xmath73 . projecting the amplitude on",
    "@xmath74 one obtains :    @xmath75    @xmath76 contributions to both amplitudes have exactly the same structure , so we compute @xmath77 following ref .",
    "@xcite then @xmath78 is obtained just changing the sign of @xmath79 .",
    "the form factors are expressed in terms of the distribution amplitudes :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the identity in color space , @xmath82 and    @xmath83    the wave functions @xmath84 are given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath85    where @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the gegenbauer polynomial .",

    "and @xmath96 at one @xmath97 using experimental data on @xmath98 and @xmath99,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +",
    "one can proceed along similar lines for processes involving @xmath4 or @xmath101 scalar mesons . instead , we use isospin , @xmath8 quark symmetry and the quark contents of the scalar mesons to obtain relation between the form factors .",
    "we also used available experimental data to obtain constraints on the form factor values .",
    "it turns out that the consistency of the two sets of values so obtained provide further confidence on the approach .",
    "we assume the conventional quark content of the pseudo scalar mesons@xcite and parameterize the mixing in the scalar sector in the strange - nonstrange basis as :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 , and the singlet - octet mixing angle @xmath104 is related to @xmath105 by @xmath106 \\simeq 55^\\circ$ ] . a diagrammatic analysis of the contributions of the form factors , which involve the quark composition and isospin and @xmath8 symmetry between up and down quarks , lead the following relations :    @xmath107    from these relations it follows that @xmath108 @xmath109 .",
    "it is possible to obtain similar relations between the annihilation form factors ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) , however we will not use @xmath112 symmetry since large deviations from the symmetry limit are expected . using the experimental results given in table ( [ table3 ] ) , the values for the scalar masses given in ref.@xcite and the values given in table ( [ table2 ] ) for the other form factors appearing in the amplitudes , it is possible to determine separately for each scalars @xmath4 and @xmath101 the allowed regions for the values of the form factors @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) respectively .",
    "the results are summarized in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig1 ] . assuming that perturbative qcd leads us the right order of magnitude for @xmath113",
    ", it follows that : @xmath117 we should note that this result is compatible ( even if slightly smaller ) with the predictions for @xmath118 @xcite obtained in a model - dependent way . using eq.([2q ] ) , it follows that @xmath119 figure ( [ fig1 ] ) shows the values allowed by the experimental data when one standard deviation is considered .",
    "one observes that @xmath120 requires a large contribution from @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , the smallest value for @xmath121is around @xmath122 , which is more than one order of magnitude bigger than the pqcd evaluation of @xmath123 . it is interesting to note in this respect that : @xmath124     and @xmath125 at one @xmath97,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +      several models where the scalars are four quark states @xcite have been published but no model is favored at present time . we shall apply our method to one example , following @xcite we assume that the quarks contents of the scalars is given by    @xmath127    where the mixing angle is obtained from the relation @xmath128 ( for @xmath129 gev ) , so @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is well - known that perturbative qcd predicts that the form factor will go like @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the number of constituents of the hadron .",
    "if @xmath134 , @xmath69 is strongly suppressed and annihilation can be neglected .",
    "varying the experimental results within one @xmath135 and using the fact that in four quark models for scalars the annihilation does not contribute to the processes ( @xmath136 ) , one concludes that :    @xmath137    proceeding in the same way with processes @xmath138 , one gets @xmath139 which are closed to the values of @xmath140 obtained assuming the scalars are two quark states .      .",
    "the dot - dashed line correspond to the four quark assignement for @xmath4 , and the space between both solid horizontal line is the value for @xmath141 expected from 2 quark models for @xmath4,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    once the allowed values for the form factors @xmath142 and @xmath115 have been constrained , we turn our attention to the subdominant processes @xmath141 which is strongly suppressed by g parity and isospin . in @xcite",
    "the author concludes that a positive identification of this process is an evidence against the four - quark assignment of @xmath4 or else for breakdown of perturbative qcd .",
    "using our estimates for annihilation contributions obtained using pqcd one can predict the values of @xmath141 .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig3 ] . in the four quark models for @xmath4 where annihilation is strongly suppressed ,",
    "one gets for @xmath143 . in the two quark model for @xmath4 ,",
    "the main source of uncertainty is the phase of the annihilation contributions which can not be fixed using pqcd .",
    "varying between @xmath144 and @xmath145 the cp - conserving phase for the annihilation , it follows that : @xmath146 where the lower limit is obtained when annihilation interferes destructively and the upper limit when annihilation interferes constructively with the other contributions .",
    "our conclusion is that this @xmath9 decay can not be used to distinguish between two and four quark assignment of the @xmath4 , unless one can obtain an independent determination of the annihilation phase .",
    "another channel suppressed by g parity is @xmath147 .",
    "it is interesting that this channel is better to distinguish between the 2 or 4 quark models for @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , in 4 quark models for @xmath4 , with the value for @xmath140 determined in previous sections , one gets @xmath148    while in the 2 quark model : @xmath149",
    "in this paper we consider processes for which the dominant contribution is suppressed .",
    "using the factorization approximation and available experimental data , we estimate the effect of annihilation penguins contribution to the processes @xmath150 and @xmath151 . we show that a consistent picture can be obtained when the scalars are described as two quark states , although one requires an important contributions from annihilation penguins to @xmath152 . within our analysis",
    "the four quark models for @xmath101 can not be excluded .    applying our estimates of the annihilation contributions to suppressed processes like @xmath7 and @xmath153 ,",
    "we conclude that the positive identification of @xmath154 can not be taken as evidence for the four quark assignment of @xmath4 .",
    "this is in contrast with ref.@xcite , where the annihilation contribution is not quantified .",
    "relevant for this conclusion is the ambiguity in the cp - conserving phase of the annihilation penguins contributions .",
    "our best candidate process to distinguish the nature of @xmath4 scalar is @xmath7 where the predictions for 4 quark models are typically one order of magnitude smaller than 2 quark models .    using the mesons quark content , @xmath8 quark symmetry and isospin we derive relations between the form factors @xmath142 to @xmath115 for different charge states .",
    "one can extend the analysis to @xmath112 however one expects large deviations from the symmetry limit .",
    "this restricts the applicability of our approach to the four quark states since in that kind of models scalars necessarily involve strange quarks .",
