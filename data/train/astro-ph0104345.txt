    "moreover , the analogy can barely be evaluated , since few direct far - ir and submillimeter observations of lbgs exist .",

    ". the limitations of these studies motivated us to observe the gravitationally lensed system ( hereafter : yee et al .",

    "@xcite ; teplitz et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and promised to be unusually detectable at longer wavelengths .",
    "from 37 march 2000 , we observed in on - off photometric mode with the 37-element max - planck millimeter bolometer ( mambo ) array ( kreysa et al .",
    "@xcite ) at the iram 30 m telescope . we pointed the array s central pixel at the optical position ( j2000 coordinates 15:14:22.20 and + 36:36:24.4 ) determined by abraham et al .",

    "we can therefore test the proposition that is a `` scaled - up '' local starburst by seeing if it fits those relations which are independent of distance ( and lensing magnification ) . a key parameter here is the uv spectral slope @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , whose observed value indicates the amount of reddening by dust ( i.e. , from some intrinsically blue @xmath17 ) for an assumed star formation history . because the same dust which reddens stellar uv continua will re - radiate the energy which it absorbs , it is natural that uv - bright local systems should obey a relationship between @xmath15 and the ratio of far - ir to uv emission .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) determine this relation for a sample which includes only galaxies whose starbursts are small enough to fit entirely within the _ iue _ aperture .",

    "figure  [ fig : meur ] plots this ratio versus @xmath15 for the 43 sources which ( a ) appear in their figure 1 , and ( b ) have flux densities in the version 2.0 _ iras _ faint source and/or point source catalogs .",
    "the local starbursts occupy a predictable locus in the diagram , extending from blue , metal - poor systems at the lower left to reddened , dusty systems at the upper right .    to place on this diagram , we first measure @xmath15 from the rest - uv spectrum of pettini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , according to the prescription of meurer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the sake of consistency .",
    "a least - squares fit ( with iterative @xmath23 rejection ) to eight spectral windows between 1100 and @xmath24 gives @xmath25 , slightly bluer than the -0.8 ( @xmath26 for @xmath27 ) measured by pettini et al .",

    ", we simply extend the scaled - up starburst hypothesis for lbgs : we assign to a dust emissivity index @xmath45 and dust temperature @xmath46 ( the mean and dispersion of the @xmath47 color temperatures for the local galaxies in figure  [ fig : meur ] , as determined from @xmath45 modified planck function fits ) .",
    "we then predict an observed flux in the rest - fir window of @xmath48 , with large and asymmetric error bars dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath49 .",
    "we emphasize that our extrapolated fir flux is conservatively large : adoption of @xmath50 and the corresponding mean @xmath51 would have lowered our estimate by a factor of two .",
    "we have also ignored the potential impact of optically thick dust emission , or of a dust component colder than 33.0k which could dominate the @xmath52 emission but contribute little to @xmath38 .    when plotted in figure",

    "while the scatter in the local sample is large , it is strictly true that relative to the fit by meurer et al .",

    "in physical terms , figure  [ fig : meur ] suggests that has somewhat more dust than its far - ir emission predicts or somewhat less dust than its uv reddening predicts .",
    "we can explore these two possibilities by making four distinct estimates of the source s dust content on the basis of the local starburst analogy .",
    "we rely in particular on the effective attenuation curve @xmath55 and other empirical relations presented by calzetti ( @xcite ) and references therein .",

    "ii . the h@xmath61-to - h@xmath62 ratio * because ionizing stars are generally younger and more embedded than those which dominate the uv continuum , the color excess measured from observations of ( gas ) recombination lines , @xmath63 , tends to exceed @xmath64 and can be straightforwardly measured using any optical extinction curve @xmath65 . in , teplitz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) report a balmer decrement of @xmath66 , which for the lmc extinction curve of howarth ( @xcite ) implies @xmath67 ( rather than the former authors @xmath68 ) . since calzetti ( @xcite )",

    "de  mello et al .",
    "( @xcite ) use the strengths of both o and b star features to argue that continuous star formation has proceeded for 25100myr , an age range whose lower end agrees with the sed fit of ellingson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for a metallicity @xmath72 ( comparable to the @xmath73 measured by teplitz et al . @xcite ) ,",
    "the appropriate _",
    "starburst99 _ models of leitherer et al .",

    "has an observed @xmath77 ; the fact that @xmath78 can be attributed to the fact that extinction is higher in the uv than in the optical . using the calzetti @xmath55 , the lmc @xmath65 , and the relation between color excesses",
    ", we can derive a single equation in @xmath64 : @xmath79 whose solution is @xmath80 .",
    "such low values are _ required _ to avoid discordant uv and @xmath81-based estimates of the star formation rate in .    *",
    "iv . the uv spectral slope * according to the empirical relation derived by meurer et al . ( @xcite ) , @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "using the calzetti @xmath55 , we then derive @xmath84 . from the analogous relation between @xmath15 and @xmath64 in calzetti ( @xcite ) and her suggestion of @xmath85 ,",
    "we would obtain @xmath86 .",
    "although our calculations of @xmath64 in take uncertain measurements and apply scaling relations about which there is substantial local scatter , it remains striking that three of the four estimates are in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "only the uv spectral slope gives a value which is too high by a factor of 23 . in principle , use of a steeper ( e.g. , smc ) extinction curve rather than the calzetti @xmath55 would lower the color excess estimated from the observed @xmath87 .",
    "however , a steeper extinction curve would also reduce the values of @xmath64 derived from @xmath53 and population synthesis models ; the difference is real .    the preponderance of evidence for a low dust content in argues against analyses which would describe its location in figure  [ fig : meur ] solely in terms of a far - ir deficit ( e.g. , sawicki @xcite ; van  der  werf et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we can erase an apparent shortfall in @xmath53 , for example , if we predict @xmath38 from @xmath88 under the assumption that the dust in is as hot as the dust in the most extreme of the local starbursts , ( @xmath89 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , since none of the other 42 systems has @xmath90 , we would essentially be discarding the local starburst analogy for lbgs while failing to explain how two independent lines of evidence ( the @xmath91 and uv/@xmath81 ratios ) could still favor a low @xmath64 .",
    "similarly , we might imagine that the observed far - ir - to - uv ratio is depressed from its intrinsic value because uv emission reddened by dust along a favored line of sight is more highly magnified than the bulk of the far - ir emission .",
    "this scenario too seems implausible . since the best lensing model of seitz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) predicts that a large fraction ( @xmath92 ) of the background source is magnified into the arc , and since uv continuum and @xmath81 emission have broadly similar spatial distributions in local starbursts ( conselice et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we would require exceptional tuning of the lensing geometry to produce agreement in all estimates of @xmath64 _ except _ that from @xmath15 .",
    "the most straightforward conclusion about is that its offset from the local relation in figure  [ fig : meur ] has more to do with @xmath15 than with @xmath53 i.e. , that the local starburst analogy holds more robustly for all other properties of than it does for the uv spectral slope .",
    "observational systematics may be partly responsible : a spectroscopic @xmath15 can be artificially reddened by differential refraction , while photometry can mislead due to intergalactic absorption as in the case , perhaps , of the @xmath93 band magnitude for used by ellingson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to derive @xmath94 .",
    "more seriously , @xmath15 may simply be unreliable as a precise indicator of dust content for individual objects .",
    "one obvious concern is that different recipes for measuring @xmath15 yield different results for the same objects . is a case in point , with estimates ranging from our @xmath95 to -0.8 ( pettini et al .",
    "@xcite ) to @xmath96 ( van  der  werf et al .",
    "however , inconsistencies also exist at @xmath1 ; measurements of @xmath15 from _ iue _ spectra by heckman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and meurer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , for example , differ by up to 0.77 for common sources .",
    "we have at least minimized the vulnerability of our own analysis to systematic errors by measuring @xmath15 with exactly the same prescription used for the comparison sample in figure  [ fig : meur ] . however , given that our understanding of @xmath15 in seems no more ( if not less ) secure than our understanding of the source s far - ir sed , sweeping conclusions about the long - wavelength properties of individual lbgs which depend heavily on their uv spectral slopes appear premature .",
    "recent measurements of the extragalactic far - ir background ( e.g. , hauser et al .",
    "@xcite ; fixsen et al .",
    "@xcite ; lagache et al .",
    "@xcite ) have placed upper bounds on the luminosity density due to star formation as a function of redshift .",
    "these constraints have stimulated competing claims as to what fractions of the background are due to optically detectable star formation ( e.g. , ouchi et al .",
    "@xcite ; adelberger & steidel @xcite ) , optically invisible star formation ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and dust - enshrouded nuclear activity ( e.g. , almaini et al .",
    "while most of the global properties of do appear to obey the same scaling relations as local starbursts encouraging news for the scaled - up starburst hypothesis for lbgs the misleading redness of its uv spectral slope offers a cautionary example of how extinction corrections and extrapolations of seds to long wavelengths can go awry ( see also adelberger & steidel @xcite ) . for the moment , the true contribution of uv - selected samples to the far - ir background must therefore remain uncertain until we can detect enough lbgs in the rest far - ir to determine how closely they resemble and/or local starbursts as a group .",
    "we thank frank bertoldi , robert zylka , and the staff of the iram 30 m for help with the observations and data reduction .",
    "we also acknowledge helpful interactions with tim heckman , claus leitherer , gerhardt meurer , max pettini , stella seitz , and christy tremonti . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
