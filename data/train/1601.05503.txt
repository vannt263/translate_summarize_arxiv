    "the issue of how star formation gets shutdown in galaxies ( quenching ) remains less understood to date . from the theoretically perspective ,",
    "several quenching mechanisms have been proposed , including the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback @xcite , halo shock - heating @xcite , morphological quenching @xcite and the environmental effects @xcite . however , observationally it is extremely difficult to identify the dominant working mechanism .",
    "for instance , massive galaxies preferentially reside in dense regions @xcite , .i.e .",
    ", the halo quenching and environmental effects are possibly both at work . in the meanwhile , they have a high probability of simultaneously hosting an agn and a bulge component @xcite , making it difficult to isolate the effect of agn feedback from that of a central bulge .",
    "such complexities have greatly hampered our knowledge of the detailed quenching picture .    in order to identify the dominant mechanism",
    "by which star formation shuts down in galaxies , much works explore the dependence of quiescence , or the quenched fraction upon a specific variable , while keeping other variables fixed @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that the @xmath9 color of a galaxy is mostly tightly linked to a dense galaxy inner structure .",
    "similar results are reported by @xcite and @xcite , who further show that quenched fraction is most tightly linked to bulge mass .",
    "given the tight correlation between bulge mass and black hole mass , the authors suggest that agn feedback is most favored .",
    "note that the above methodology strongly relies on the tightness of the measured quiescence ",
    "variable relation .",
    "this can be misleading in some cases .",
    "as shown in observations and simulations , a fraction of the quenched galaxies will undergo dry merging @xcite , through which the properties of galaxies are reshaped and the clues of quenching are smeared out . as a consequence ,",
    "some properties of the dry merging remnants may be well correlated with quiescence , however they are not directly pointing to the quenching processes .",
    "an example is the phenomenology of `` mass quenching '' @xcite , that galaxies with high stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) tend to have a high quenched fraction .",
    "there have been evidences showing that the properties of giant quenched galaxies ( such as structure and faber  jackson relation ) are more reasonably interpreted in a dry merging framework @xcite .",
    "dry merging is obviously irrelevant to quenching .",
    "to avoid such a confusion , one could alternatively search for the clues at the epoch when a galaxy is not fully quenched yet .",
    "such attempts have been carried out by studying the green valley galaxies @xcite . to make a step further , it will be exiting to probe the onset of quenching in a star - forming galaxy ( sfg ) .",
    "however , this is very challenging since it is difficult to determine which sfg is going to quench . a practicable way would be studying the star formation properties of individual sfgs to search for the early quenching signals .",
    "ideally , a direct investigation of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) distribution of a sfg will be helpful in diagnosing whether quenching has occurred in that galaxy .",
    "such studies require a data set which contains 2-dimensional information of individual galaxies , for example , the integral field spectroscopic ( ifs ) data . the ifs sample obtained in the early projects ( such as sauron @xcite and diskmass @xcite )",
    "is proved to be powerful in studying galactic physics . however , the existed ifs sample is still relatively small . to collect a larger ifs sample ,",
    "several large projects such as manga @xcite , califa @xcite and sami @xcite are launched recently . exploiting the early data products of these projects ,",
    "some studies have begun to study the 2-dimensional star formation histories of a large local galaxy sample @xcite .    to resolve the ssfr of a large galaxy sample",
    ", one can alternatively use the existed multi - band imaging data .",
    "the 2-dimensional properties of galaxies can also be studied by utilizing spatially - resolved multi - band photometry @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xmath10 @xcite and sdss @xcite data to resolve the star formation properties inside / outside the half light radius of a large local sfg sample . throughout this paper , we assume a concordance @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 mpc@xmath16 , and a @xcite imf .",
    "this work makes use of the uv  optical multi - band data , which are drawn from the sdss and @xmath10 survey . with these data",
    ", it is still challenging to directly measure of the ssfr distribution of galaxies . to be simplified ,",
    "in this work we will use nuv@xmath1 color as the representative of ssfr . since uv luminosity @xmath17 is an sfr indicator ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nuv@xmath1 is thus a proxy of sfr/@xmath18 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19-band luminosity . in this sense",
    ", nuv@xmath1 is a luminosity weighted ssfr .",
    "@xcite first establish that the star formation history of a galaxy can be well constrained on the basis of its nuv@xmath1 color . in a recent paper , @xcite further shows that nuv@xmath1 is more tightly correlated with ssfr than @xmath20 and @xmath21 , especially in the low ssfr regime .",
    "the @xmath22 imaging has a relatively low resolution ( the _ galex _ nuv image has a resolution of 1 pixel=15 and a point spread function ( psf ) with full width at half - maximum ( fwhm)=53 ) , which hampers a high - resolution study for a large sfg sample . to investigate a large sample , in this work we only resolve the nuv@xmath1 color of galaxies in two regions , .i.e , a central region and an outer region .",
    "we refer the central region to be @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radius enclosing 50% of the sdss @xmath19-band petrosian flux . by doing this",

    "based on the uv  optical raw imaging data , we have generated a multi - band photometric catalog following the pipeline of @xcite . here we give a brief review of the data processing . as the first step , we cross - matched the sdss data release 8 spectroscopic sample @xcite with the @xmath10 dr6 frames and downloaded their uv+opical images . for the fuv and uv bands , only those with an exposure time greater than 1000 seconds are finally used .",
    "we register every image to the frame geometry of the nuv band .",
    "the images of each galaxies are then sheared into @xmath26 stamps .",
    "since the sdss image has a higher resolution than the uv image , we degrade the former by convolving a nuv psf kernel so that the uv and optical images are finally spatially matched .",
    "the psf kernel is generated by stacking the star images in that @xmath10 frame .",

    "given the tight correlations between black hole mass , bulge mass and @xmath3 , this observation supports the agn feedback paradigm at a qualitative level .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows that massive , high @xmath3 sfgs indeed have relatively red nuv@xmath25 distributions , supporting that the star formation of bulge is at least partly controlled by the bulge - related process .",
    "however , this trend does not hold for the less massive galaxies ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] thus suggests that the quenching picture of low mass sfgs is not the same as that of the massive ones .",
    "as already established , low mass galaxies are mainly quenched through environmental effects @xcite . in a dense environment ,",
    "gas stripping will cause quenching first on galactic outskirts , especially for the low mass systems @xcite . the `` outside - in '' quench mode of low mass galaxies",
    "has been recently confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose the build up of a central bulge is sufficient to stabilize the surrounding gas disk from collapsing and forming new stars , which can cause quenching in a sfg without expelling / depleting its gas .",
    "in a recent work , @xcite find that the high @xmath72 sfgs have a larger intrinsic scatter in their disk ssfr , based on which they argued that the presence of a central bulge has a dramatically impact on the galaxy scale star formation . in this work , we show that the nuv@xmath25 of massive sfgs strongly depends on @xmath3 , whereas nuv@xmath61 does not ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the disk star formation of a sfg is less affected by its inner structure .",
    "the `` morphological quenching '' scenario is thus not supported by our data .",
    "recently , @xcite suggest that a key part of `` mass quenching '' is the build up of an inactive bulge component .",
    "this is supported by figure  [ fig7 ] of this work .",
    "given that many massive , bulgy sfgs have been partly quenched , it is important to investigate the contribution of the `` bulgy galaxies '' to the whole sfg population .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the fractions of `` bulgy sfgs '' ( with @xmath3>2.5 ) as a function of @xmath2 . for our sample",
    ", one can see that the this fraction is around 10% at @xmath5 , while it rapidly increases to 60% 70% at @xmath79 .",
    "a similar trend can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    for comparison , we overplot the results of two sfgs samples drawn from @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "we use similar sfg selection criteria but do not apply any @xmath24 cut to the comparison samples .",
    "it can be seen that the results of the two comparison samples are well consistent with each other .",
    "one can also see that the fractions derived from the sfgs sample of this work are obviously lower than those of the comparison samples , especially at the mass range of log(@xmath44)=[10.0,11.0 ] .",
    "we have checked the @xmath24 distributions of sfgs and confirmed that at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath35 , sfgs in the highest @xmath3 quartile have a smaller @xmath24 distribution than the mean , especially for the massive ones , i.e. , our @xmath24 cut is biased against high @xmath3 sfgs . accounting for the sample selection bias , the intrinsic ( nuv@xmath25)(nuv@xmath61 ) distributions should be even redder than those presented in figure  [ fig5 ] at the massive end .",
    "aiming to resolve the ssfr of individual galaxies and to better understand how quenching process at its early phase , we measure the nuv@xmath1 colors both inside and outside the half - light radius for a sample of 6,324 face - on local sfgs .",
    "a very tight linear correlation is found between nuv@xmath1 and @xmath4 , supporting that nuv@xmath1 is a good photometric stellar age ( or specific star formation rate ) indicator , at least for these face - on sfgs .",
    "we investigate how these two colors depend on stellar mass and galaxy structure .",
    "our findings are the following :    \\1 . bellow @xmath82 , the central nuv@xmath1 is on average only @xmath0 0.25 mag redder than the outer nuv@xmath1",
    ". the intrinsic value would be even smaller after accounting for dust correction ; above @xmath83 , the central nuv@xmath1 becomes systematically much redder than the outer nuv@xmath1 for more massive galaxies .",
    "bellow @xmath82 , the central nuv@xmath1 shows no dependence on srsic index @xmath3 .",
    "however , above this mass , galaxies with a higher @xmath3 tend to be redder in the central nuv@xmath1 color .",
    "our analysis suggests that the red central color presented in massive galaxies is owing to their old bulge stellar population .",
    "our findings thus suggest that the central regions of less massive sfgs are comparably active to the outer regions .",
    "in contrast , the bulge of a portion of massive galaxies , especially for those with a high @xmath3 , has been quenched .",
    "the presence of old bulges in massive galaxies naturally explains the flattened slope of the sfr@xmath2 relation seen at the massive end .",
    "our findings also provide a direct interpretation of the intrinsic scatter of the star formation main sequence .",
