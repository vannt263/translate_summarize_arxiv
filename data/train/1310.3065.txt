    "<S> the spin susceptibilities can be fitted satisfactorily with the curie - weiss law , @xmath28 , in the paramagnetic regime and are summarized in table  [ table - mueff ] . assuming the amount of co@xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) with s=1/2 can be determined directly from the na content x without oxygen vacancies , it is expected that the @xmath33 values per co@xmath0 should be 1.732 @xmath34 with g=2 . </S>",

    "<S> while the coo@xmath3 layer of na@xmath2coo@xmath3 has been viewed as closely packed edge - sharing octahedra that forms a 2d triangular lattice , the distortion from the flattened coo@xmath3 layer along the rhombohedral ( 111 ) axis requires the distortion of octahedral cef , whereupon the @xmath6 degeneracy is lifted . </S>",
    "<S> the octahedral distortion has been reflected on the subtle difference of co - o bond lengths and o - co - o bond angles in coo@xmath7 through synchrotron x - ray structure refinement before.@xcite in the crystal field theory for elongated octahedral cef , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the extreme case of such a distortion can be observed in the square - planar cef that is derived by removing apical oxygens to infinity , which lowers the z - related levels significantly , as demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - cef](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the first published lda band calculation for na@xmath2coo@xmath3 , the @xmath6 splitting has been commonly mislabeled as @xmath14-@xmath8 in the physics community ( see fig .  [ fig - naxcoo2]),@xcite and @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] after an axis transformation of the principal z - axis from the apical oxygen direction to the ( 111 ) direction in rhombohedral symmetry.@xcite note that the relative positions of the ligand does not change after axis transformation , and an identical @xmath6 splitting , as a result of octahedral cef distortion , can be described for any selection of an axes system . </S>",
    "<S> the most common distortion in the rhombohedral symmetry description is the thickness change of the coo@xmath3 layer , which can be roughly represented by a small elongation from the original perfect coo@xmath7 octahedron .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) the coo@xmath3 plane can also be viewed as edge - sharing square - planar chains with inter - chain coupling instead of edge - sharing octahedra . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo - octahedron of coo@xmath7 and co - o - co at 90@xmath41 are shown in the insets.,width=336 ]    if the coo@xmath3 layer is viewed as closely packed edge - sharing octahedra , it is impossible to create one distorted octahedral cef by adjusting the apical co - o bond lengths alone , i.e. , to create a distortion severe enough for both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 groups to split wide and leave one small gap between them . instead of assuming that the coo@xmath3 layer which is composed of edge - sharing octahedra , we propose an alternative view ; the coo@xmath3 layer could be composed of edge - sharing square - planar coo@xmath3 chains with nontrivial inter - chain coupling , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - chain ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are two main reasons to make such an assumption ; the first is because the earlier view of octahedral cef with trigonal distortion failed to provide a reasonable argument to allow the formation of a narrow gap between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 groups , and the second is that each oxygen with two electrons missing from its @xmath42-orbital can form , at most , two covalent bonds with the neighboring co atoms in a 90@xmath41 coordination , as illustrated in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - chain ] . </S>",
    "<S> chemically , it is impossible for oxygen to form three covalent bonds with the neighboring three co atoms , as implied in the earlier octahedral picture .    </S>",
    "<S> the modified view of cef is effectively in between an elongated octahedral cef and a square - planar cef . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the co - o only has four covalent @xmath43-bonds within each square - planar coo@xmath3 unit , and the apical oxygens should not be viewed as individual ligands but as weak effective charges dressed by the neighboring edge - sharing chains , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - chain ] . </S>",
    "<S> the coo@xmath3 plane originally assumed to be in edge - sharing octahedra is now viewed as edge - sharing square - planar chains with inter - chain coupling , i.e. , all of the oxygens in each square - planar edge - sharing chain also serve as the effective apical oxygen for the neighboring square - planar coo@xmath3 unit to form a pseudo - octahedron . </S>",
    "<S> the actual crystal field can now be understood as a unique octahedral cef with apical oxygens of a much less effective charge . </S>",
    "<S> in fact similar energy splitting can also be generated through the addtional magnetic couplings of @xmath44 and @xmath45 per polaron unit defined in the calculations by daghofer _ </S>",
    "<S> _ et al.__@xcite starting from the square - planar cef , the effective charge of a distorted octahedral cef may be formed when the @xmath14 ( d@xmath46 ) level is raised slightly above the @xmath37 ( d@xmath47 ) level . </S>",
    "<S> a clear level inversion between @xmath14 and @xmath37 between the square - planar and elongated octahedral cef occurs once the effective charge of the apical oxygen is properly tuned through the inter - chain coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) the low spin ( ls ) state and intermediate spin ( is ) state for co@xmath4 ( 3d@xmath11 ) derived from the proposed cef . </S>",
    "<S> thermal or strain energy at ambient temperature would allow activation between @xmath14-@xmath37 of the narrow gap @xmath48 on the order of @xmath2410 mev.,width=336 ]    following our proposed model , which leads to the possible existence of a narrow gap between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 groups , i.e. , the small gap ( @xmath48 ) between @xmath14-@xmath37 shown in fig .  [ fig - cef](c ) , we may re - examine the spins of the 3d electrons in the co ions . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that the ls states of co@xmath4 ( @xmath49 ) and co@xmath0 ( @xmath50 ) are s=0 and s=1/2 , respectively . in the newly constructed cef with a narrow gap between @xmath14-@xmath37 of @xmath2410 mev,@xcite the thermal or stain energy at ambient temperature would be sufficient to activate electrons from the filled @xmath37 to the empty @xmath14 , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig - spin ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , hund s rule coupling is an alternative description for the existence of is state when the pairing energy is able to overcome the small cef gap.@xcite for the is state ( s=1 ) of co@xmath4 generated through the activation process , the quantity and positions of s=1 must fluctuate in a boltzmann distribution of population and at random positions . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to assume that the curie constant should change as a function of temperature , i.e. , increased s=1 should be observed at higher temperatures because of increased s=1 activation across the narrow @xmath51 gap for co@xmath4 .    </S>",

    "<S> the fitted curie constant for x=0.71 does show a temperature independent value at high temperature above @xmath24150k ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig - ct ] . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of c(t ) ( c=@xmath55 ) could be coming from the @xmath56 through added number of localized spins , or from the @xmath57 through added couplings that enhance the size of the magnetic moment of the localized spins effectively . </S>",
    "<S> t. moriya has shown that the spin fluctuation of fm coupled itinerant electrons in the strongly correlated system can also be described with a curie s law defined in parallel to that of the localized spins.@xcite while we can not rule out that the observed curie constant has contribution from the correlated itinerant electrons completely , especially from the rkky type coupling of itinerant electrons to the localized spins of s=1/2 for co@xmath0,@xcite the impact of these couplings should be diminishing at higher temperature . however , the increasing c(t ) as a function of temperature for x=0.82 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - ct ] ) does not support , or at least implies that the scenario of coupling enhanced effective moment can not be the dominant factor . </S>",
    "<S> quite the contrary , the increasing c(t ) suggests that more localized spins are added to the system at higher temperature , which agrees with a picture that more spins of s=1 are generated from the thermally activated is state of co@xmath4 .    </S>",
