    "2 we describe the new observations , data reduction procedures and a comparison of the old and new spectra for this source . this is followed (  [ impl ] ) by a discussion of physical and phenomenological implications of the spectra change in pg 1416129 .",
    "new spectra of pg 1416129 ( z=0.12928@xmath30.00007 from [ oiii ] @xmath15007 ) were obtained on the 2.12-m telescope of the osservatorio astronomico nacional at san pedro martir , baja california , mexico on may 9 2000 between 7:28 and 8:32 ut , under photometric sky conditions .",
    "a boller & chivens spectrograph was equipped with a 600 l / mm grating with a tektronix tk1024ab ccd chip as the detector ( 2 arcsec slit width ) .",

    "it was reduced with standard iraf procedures .",
    "line properties were derived after normalization of the two spectra to the  flux in a spectrum obtained on february 17 , 1990 ( boroson & green 1992 : hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the 4200 - 5500@xmath5 rest frame region in both the 1990 and 2000 spectra .",
    "after subtraction of the underlying continuum ( fit with a low order polynomial ; contamination from the light of the host galaxy is negligible ) , the  profiles were cleaned of , , and   emission ( for details see marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) . observed line flux , rest - frame equivalent width and fwhm values derived from the 2000 may 8 spectrum are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "errors are 20%  ( 2@xmath6 ) for the flux and equivalent width and 10%  ( 2@xmath6 ) for the fwhm .",
    "emission is weak in the 1990 spectrum ( bg92 estimated w()= 31  ) and weaker in the new spectrum as expected if it correlates with the strength of the classical blr ( e.g. bg92 ) .",
    "we subtracted a scaled and broadened i zw 1 template ( @xmath7 ) from the 2000 may 8 spectrum in order to remove  contamination .",
    "emission may have a more significant effect on the blue side of the  profile if a significant  vbc exists in our new spectrum .",
    "after several empirical attempts , the smoothest residuals were obtained by using the  measured from our new spectrum as a template to subtract suspected broad  emission .",
    "this subtraction assumes a much stronger   emission than the estimate given in bg92 ( w()/w ( ) @xmath8 0.04 ) .",

    "the main observational results of this investigation are : ( a ) the almost complete disappearance of the   ( on 2000 may 8 the  flux is @xmath9   of the original flux ) in a reasonably luminous quasar with bolometric luminosity @xmath1010@xmath11  and ( b ) the much smaller variation in the  component ( a factor @xmath8 2 ) .",
    "the 1990 observation of the  region in pg 1416129 showed inflections between narrow ( ) , broad and very broad line components .",
    "the 2000 spectrum shows the almost complete disappearance of the broad component  made more evident by the lack of change in .",
    "the bulk of the residual broad line emission is associated with the very broad component , also seen in 1990 .",
    "the robustness of the  component to a dramatic continuum change that quenched  strongly suggests that the vbc represents a distinct emitting component .",
    "similar arguments have been made previously based on variability and line inflection evidence ( corbin 1997a , b ) .",
    "the weakness of  emission in pg 1416129 suggests that the  can not be attributed to a red - shelf of enhanced  emission ( korista 1992 ) .",

    "the answer is `` no '' , at least for a vbc like the one observed in pg 1416129 , within current detection limits .",
    "sources exist with no hint of a bc / vbc inflection ,  red wing , or profile shift .",
    "evidence also exists for vbc components of  ( e.g. , ferland korista & peterson 1990 ; marziani & sulentic 1993 ) and     ( laor et al . 1994 ; 1995 ) in several sources .",
    "it is very likely that these vbc components are related to the , although  may often show a more symmetric , boxy profile ( as in pg 1138 + 222 ; marziani & sulentic 1993 ) .",
    "however , even if it is possible to disentangle the  emission from the surrounding  contamination , it is usually weak , with a flux distributed over a wide wavelength range often merging smoothly with the blue wing of .",
    "asymmetry measurements are therefore intrinsically difficult and dependent on assumptions about the  shape even if the s / n of the data is high .",

    "the simplest scenario is that  faded following a high amplitude ( a factor @xmath12 4 ) decrease in ionizing continuum level .",
    "the  luminosity can be conventionally explained as due to an ensemble of optically thick clouds of very small filling factor ( @xmath24 ) in a spherically symmetric region extending from the vblr radius up to 10@xmath25 cm .",
    "another potentially very important constraint arises from the apparent absence of a bc in the  profile of pg 1411 - 129 .",

    "in the case of pg 1416129 , photoionization calculations performed using cloudy 94 ( ferland 2000 ) are able to reproduce the  luminosity assuming that an optically thin screen of gas surrounds the continuum sources at a distance of 10@xmath29 cm , with @xmath30 3 , and @xmath31 10@xmath32 .",

    "careful analysis of the -contaminated  line profile would help to clarify the issue .",
    "pg1416129 suggests that the answer to this question is `` no '' .",
    "sources with `` naked '' vblr lines certainly exist . a spectrum of pg1416129 with lower s / n or resolution would not reveal the small blr residual as a feature . in 1990 bg92 reported fwhm ( ) @xmath8 6100   and  @xmath8 0.2 for pg1416 .",
    "the classical fwhm ( ) was overestimated and   underestimated .",
    "this mis - estimation of blr properties will occur whenever a significant vbc is present unless the local continuum is set above that component . using the 2000 spectrum to model the vblr component in the 1990 spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table [ tab2 ] ) suggests that the correct values for the fwhm ( ) and  are 4000 km / s and 0.7 respectively .",
    "these parameter changes certainly exceed published error estimates for such measures . in the eigenvector 1 correlation plane of fwhm ( ) vs. , this change will move pg 1416129 towards the population a domain .",
    "it will also produce an apparently    stronger \" source ( from @xmath80.2 to 0.7 ) than is typically found for broad line rl / rq pop b sources .",
    "if we parameterize pg1416129 today we would measure fwhm ( `` h@xmath43 '' ) @xmath8 13000  along with very weak / undetectable .",
    "we expect no correlation between those two parameters because we know that  strength correlates with the classical  and _ not _ with the .",
    "we would in fact be measuring a `` naked '' vblr .",
    "the implication for statistical studies and sample comparisons is clear : we must take into account the vblr feature or we are not measuring the same thing in different sources .",
    "sometimes we measure a pure blr component , sometimes a pure vblr component and sometimes a composite .",
    "the implications for the eigenvector 1 space are also clear .",
    "it is possible that the pop a - b differences motivated by the pg sample reflect the presence of the extra vblr emitting component in pop b sources , and that the classical blr may be more similar from source to source than we have appreciated .",
    "much of the predictive power of variability / reverberation studies involves determining the sequential response of the line core and wings .",
    "these results have previously been argued to support dominance of radial or rotational motions in the blr ( e.g. gaskell 1988 ; obrien et al . 1998 ; goad et al .",
    "the implication of the vblr is that the red wing of the line may have nothing to do with the line core .",
    "therefore the presence or lack of a pre- , same or post response allows us to infer nothing about the source structure . monitoring data for sources like fairall 9",
    "could now be profitably reprocessed in the light of the vblr concept .    in a sample of 14 rl sources involved in an annual spectroscopic campaign corbin & smith ( 2000 ) report that most changes occur in the core of the line rather than the wings .",
    "they find that b2 1721 - 34 shows a decrease in the core component as the continuum declined .",
    "they also argue that the wings of the line have increased at the same time .",
    "close examination of their spectra show that most of the change in the wings has occurred on the blue side .",
    "all of this is consistent with the idea that the peak is dominated by the classical blr which is optically thick .",
    "the red wing , especially , arises in large part in optically thin gas , so it would be expected to change much less . in any case",
    "the two wings may be phenomenologically distinct .",
    "it is important to stress that agn pop a sources mirror the behavior of pop b and rl agn .",
    "the blue wing of  seems to be associated with an optically thin wind emitting mostly hil like . the blue wing in population",
    "a sources may therefore show a lack of response to continuum change but for reasons unrelated to a vblr component .",
    "the quasar pg1416 - 129 shows two broad line regions .",
    "the classical blr and vblr are identified through inflections in the low ionization balmer line profiles .",
    "they have a different place of origin and also arise from a physically distinct ( opticaly thick / thin ) regions as indicated by the difference of their response to the continuum change over the past ten years .",
