    "graphite and graphene are closely related forms of carbon in which the atoms are located in the nodes of a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the main difference is that graphite is formed by a whole stack of the two - dimensional carbon sheets that constitute a single graphene layer .",
    "@xcite adsorption of gases on top of graphene and graphite are expected to show similar trends .",
    "this is in fact what has been shown by computer simulations of the phase diagrams of adsorbed quantum gases on graphene , both in the first ,  @xcite and second  @xcite layers . in general , those calculations render phase diagrams which are very close to the experimental ones on graphite .  @xcite the only appreciable difference is the binding energy of the adsorbate species on top of the carbon structure , bigger in the graphite case .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , there are no experimental data yet on adsorption of quantum gases on graphene to be compared to .",
    "most of that work , both from the experimental and theoretical sides , has been devoted to the determination of the phase diagram of the first layer of quantum gases and solids adsorbed on top of graphite .",
    "@xcite however , there has been some measurements of the properties of a second @xmath3he sheet on top of an incommensurate helium layer , directly in contact with a graphite surface ,  @xcite work that can be compared to the simulations on the same subject .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the second layer of molecular hydrogen on top of graphite has been less explored .",
    "experimentally , the second layer of molecular hydrogen and deuterium adsorbed both on graphite and mgo has been studied using calorimetric measurements .",

    "studies the promotion to a second layer and the phase diagram of pure @xmath0-h@xmath1 ( @xmath4-h@xmath1 ) and @xmath2-d@xmath1 ( @xmath5-d@xmath1 ) second layers on graphite .",
    "one of the main conclusions of that work is that the ground state of both isotopes in the second layer is a quasi two - dimensional solid .",
    "those calorimetric measurements suggest triple points at t @xmath6 6 k for h@xmath1 and t @xmath6 11 k for d@xmath1 . for lower temperatures and densities those solids seem to coexist with infinitely diluted gases .",
    "the main goal of our present work is to perform diffusion monte carlo calculations to determine the phase diagram of the second layer of h@xmath1 adsorbed on a first layer of h@xmath1 on graphene , and of the second layer of d@xmath1 adsorbed on the first layer of d@xmath1 , also on graphene .",
    "the results so obtained will be compared to the experimental ones for the same systems on graphite ,  @xcite the only ones available , in order to assess the possible differences . in particular",

    "iii . finally , the main conclusions are discussed in sec .",
    "the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method is a stochastic technique that allows us to obtain the ground state of a zero - temperature system of bosons .",
    "since the species adsorbed ( @xmath4-h@xmath1 and @xmath5-d@xmath1 ) on graphene are both bosons , we can obtain through dmc the arrangement of molecules with the lowest energy for each surface density . in order to reduce the statistical variance of the many - body problem ,",
    "the algorithm uses a guiding wave function @xmath7 which enhances the occupation probability in places where the hydrogen density is expected to be large .",
    "@xcite in general , @xmath7 depends on the coordinates of all atoms or molecules in the simulation cell .",
    "however , in this work , we will consider that the carbon atoms of the graphene layer are kept in fixed positions , what means that their overall effect on the hydrogen molecules can be described as an external potential . within this approximation",

    ", in which a second layer of @xmath3he on graphene was simulated .",
    "basically , for a fixed total hydrogen density , we considered only the arrangement for which the total energy per molecule was lower . in practice , this means that we have to take a fixed solid density for the first layer , and to change the number of molecules ( if we have a liquid ) or the lattice constant ( if we have a solid ) in the second layer .",
    "the structure of the second layer solid was assumed to be incommensurate with respect to the one on the first layer , i.e. , the phase diagram was assumed to be of the same type as that of helium on graphene .",

    "no exchange of molecules between the first and second layer was allowed .",
    "importantly , we did not fix the positions of the molecules closest to the graphene surface , i.e. , we took into account the zero point motion of all the hydrogen molecules .",

    "the full squares correspond to the energy per molecule of a triangular incommensurate solid adsorbed on a single layer on top of graphene , and were taken from ref . .",
    "when we considered only a hydrogen layer , incommensurate means that there is no registry of the hydrogen molecules with respect to the carbon sheet .",
    "the third - order polynomial fit displayed on top of them is a guide - to - the eye . to study second layer structures , we put on top of one of these incommensurate structures a set of hydrogen molecules described by a guiding wave function with @xmath52 ( [ trialsol ] ) .",
    "the dimensions of the simulation cells were determined by the density of incommensurate solid in the first layer since , in all cases , the simulation cells comprised 120 h@xmath1 molecules close to the graphene surface .",
    "then , we put enough hydrogen on top of them to produce surface areas ( the inverse of density ) in the range displayed in fig .",
    "[ energy1 ] . to be sure that the energy per molecule considering both hydrogen sheets was the minimum one , we performed several sets of simulations with different incommensurate solid densities ( in the first layer ) .",
    "in particular , we considered @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath33 .",
    "our results indicate that on the second layer , the arrangement with lowest energy per h@xmath1 molecule is a liquid on top of a solid whose density is @xmath54 @xmath33 .",

    "[ energy1 ] . here",
    ", incommensurate means that the second layer is registered neither with respect to the first layer nor with the underlying graphene .",
    "the minimum energies per h@xmath1 molecule corresponded to an arrangement in which the lower layer density was @xmath55 @xmath33 ; those data are displayed in fig .",
    "[ energy1 ] as open squares .",
    "the line on top of them represents also a third - order polynomial fit .",
    "we considered also two second layer commensurate ( with respect to the first layer ) solids : a @xmath59 lattice ,  @xcite and an oblique bilayer structure ,  @xcite both proposed originally to describe second layers of @xmath3he on graphite .",
    "the latter was suggested to be stable for the second layer of h@xmath1  @xcite and d@xmath1  @xcite on graphite .",
    "the energy per h@xmath1 molecule of those registered phases is represented by a full and open triangle , respectively .",
    "we can see that both structures are metastable with respect to a set of two incommensurate layers , since their energies per molecule are larger .",
    "their corresponding energies per h@xmath1 molecule are -274.9 @xmath60 0.1 k ( oblique structure ) , and -304.6 @xmath60 0.1 k ( @xmath59 ) , versus -293.0 @xmath60 0.1 k and -309.38 @xmath60 0.08 k of the corresponding incommensurate structures of the same densities ( 0.173 and 0.157 @xmath33 , respectively ) . a @xmath61 commensurate solid ,",
    "also proposed to be stable for helium ,  @xcite and not displayed for simplicity , was also considered and found to be unstable with respect to a second layer incommensurate solid .    with all of that in mind",
    ", we can draw a double - tangent maxwell construction to obtain the phase diagram of the second layer of h@xmath1 on graphene .",
    "the slope of that line is minus the internal pressure at which the transition takes place , and has to be positive for stable arrangements .",
    "in addition , if several transitions are possible , one has to consider only the corresponding to the lowest pressure . the straight line displayed in fig .",
    "[ energy1 ] , that joints a single layer incommensurate solid and its second layer counterpart fulfills all the necessary requirements .",
    "we can see that the energy per h@xmath1 molecule of a second layer liquid ( full circles ) is always above the double - tangent line .",
    "this means that a second layer liquid is unstable with respect to a mixture of a single layer solid and another with two incommensurate sheets .",
    "the surface areas at which the slopes of both three - order polynomial fits are the same define the stability limits for the phases involved in the transition . in our case , those correspond to an upper density limit for a single layer solid ( equivalent to a second layer promotion ) of @xmath62 @xmath33 , and a lowest density value of @xmath63 @xmath33 for a two layered solid .",
    "both results are in excellent agreement with the calorimetric values of h@xmath1 on graphite :  @xcite @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath33 .",
    "the chemical potential for h@xmath1 at the monolayer - bilayer transition derived from our simulations was -161 @xmath60 2 k. this means that a second layer of h@xmath1 is still stable with respect to the formation of a bulk h@xmath1 crystal , whose ground state chemical potential is -92.3 k @xcite .",
    "this also means that the second layer solidifies at h@xmath1 densities as low as @xmath66 @xmath33 . as in @xmath3he ,",
    "@xcite the first layer suffers a compression that produces a @xmath67% increase of its density upon the adsorption of the second hydrogen sheet .     for molecules located on the second layer .",
    "full circles are the results of a liquid phase , and full squares , for a triangular incommensurate solid one .",
    "the error bars are similar in both cases and for simplicity they are only shown in the liquid case .",
    "lines are three - order polynomial fits to the respective data .",
    ", width=283 ]    we also compared our simulation results for h@xmath1 on a second layer to similar data obtained for a pure two dimensional ( 2d ) system . in fig .",
    "[ energy2 ] , we show the energy per h@xmath1 molecule as a function of density , but only for the molecules on that second sheet .",
    "this energies are taken from the same set of simulation results as the ones displayed in fig .",
    "[ energy1 ] , i.e. , the molecules of the first layer are not kept frozen .",
    "a glance to the previous figure indicates that the binding energies of these molecules are smaller than the ones located in the first layer by at least a factor of two .",
    "this is true for both liquid ( full circles ) and triangular incommensurate ( full squares ) phases .",
    "the lines on top of each set of symbols are least - squares fits to the expression @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the hydrogen density in that second layer and @xmath70 stands for the density at which the energy per h@xmath1 molecule has a minimum ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the parameters obtained for the liquid and solid phases , together with their first layer ( taken from ref . ) and pure two - dimensional ( from ref . ) counterparts , are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "those results indicate that a pure two - dimensional system of h@xmath1 molecules is a worse description for the second than for the first layer of h@xmath1 on graphene , and that the 2d equation of state is worse for a liquid phase than for a solid one .",
    "for instance , the energy differences , once subtracted the infinite - dilution energy ( @xmath72 ) , between a 2d system and a first layer of h@xmath1 on graphene are @xmath73 % for a liquid , and @xmath74 % for a solid . in comparison ,",
    "those same differences between a 2d and a second layer system are @xmath75 and 22 % , respectively . the same , but to a lesser extend ,",
    "can be said of the differences between the values of @xmath70 : @xmath76 % for the 2d and first layer solids difference , gap that increases up to @xmath77 % if instead of a first layer we have a second one .",
    "those same percentages grow to @xmath73 % and 15 % for the same comparisons for liquid phases .",
    "moreover , table [ table1 ] gives us another interesting piece of information : the upper solid is more stable with respect to a liquid arrangement than in a flat structure or a first layer sheet .",
    "this is because the the energy difference at the respective equilibrium densities is highest in the second layer case .",
    "the corresponding values are 6.8 k ( second layer ) , versus 2.023 k ( 2d ) , and 1.8 k ( first layer ) .",
    "we can also see that the density minimum for the second - layer solid phase ( @xmath78 @xmath33 ) is comparable to the equilibrium density mentioned above ( @xmath79 @xmath33 ) , obtained from the maxwell construction including the whole system .",
    ".density and energy per molecule for the phases displayed in fig .",
    "[ energy2 ] from fits using eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) .",
    "the results for a pure two dimensional system ( 2d , ref . ) and a first layer of h@xmath1 on top of graphene ( gr , ref . )",
    "are also shown for comparison .",
    "@xmath72 is the energy per h@xmath1 molecule in the infinite dilution limit for each system , @xmath71 is the minimum energy per h@xmath1 molecule and @xmath70 is the density that corresponds to that energy . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "in this work , we have studied the complete phase diagram of the second layer of both h@xmath1 and d@xmath1 adsorbed on top of a single graphene layer . since we used a set diffusion monte carlo calculations ,",
    "the results correspond to the zero - temperature ground state of the system . to obtain the real stability limits , we had to perform maxwell constructions between phases that comprised one and two hydrogen layers , but we found that if we used only the data corresponding to a second one , the description is good enough to reproduce the solid equilibrium of the complete two - sheet system .",
    "our results for the promotion density to the second layer and the minimum density in this second layer agree satisfactorily with available calorimetric results for graphite , pointing to the accuracy of both the method used and the interaction potentials entering in the hamiltonian .",
    "that our results on graphene are comparable to the experimental ones on graphite also means that both surfaces are basically equivalent as absorbents , being the only possible difference the binding energy of the hydrogen molecules to the carbon surface",
    ".    however , calorimetric measurements only give the total density for the onset of a solid structure at t @xmath80 0 . from ref .",
    ", those densities appear to be 0.165 ( h@xmath1 ) and 0.178 ( d@xmath1 ) @xmath33 .",
    "both are lower than the ones assigned in the same work to the oblique structures : 0.173 ( h@xmath1 ) and 0.186 ( d@xmath1 ) @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the fact that the former densities are compatible with our simulation results supports our suggestion of a double incommensurate solid as the structure for the inferred solid phase .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the energies per molecule for the oblique solid and the two sets of triangular layers at the same densities indicates that , at least for @xmath81 , the commensurate arrangement is not stable .",
    "one could speculate that the disagreement between calorimetric data , in one side , and leed and neutron diffraction , on the other , could be originated by the tiny difference between the diffraction patterns of a double incommensurate structure and a double oblique layer .",
    "@xcite in fact , the oblique phase was proposed in the past as the ground state of a second layer of @xmath3he on graphite in neutron diffraction studies ,  @xcite but further calorimetric measurements concluded that triangular structures were preferred .",
    "this could be also the case for hydrogen .",
    "on the other hand , our results rely on empirical potentials that have been used to reproduce reasonably well the equation of state of the first layer of both h@xmath1 and d@xmath1 on graphene ,  @xcite but we can not exclude that , in the future , more elaborate interactions could change our predictions for the second layers .    on a different note , from the behavior of this second layer",
    ", we can say that when the number of adsorbed layers grows , the entire arrangement becomes more  solid - like \" than  liquid - like \" .",
    "the reason is that , even though the binding energy in the second layer is lower than in the first one , the incommensurate solid structure is much more stabilized with respect to a liquid than in the first layer case .",
    "this is probably the reason why the experimental critical points for the liquid - vapor coexistence regions of h@xmath1 and d@xmath1 adsorbed on graphite approach those of the bulk solids as the number of adsorbed layers grows ,  @xcite making impossible to obtain a stable liquid by reducing the dimensionality of the system .",
