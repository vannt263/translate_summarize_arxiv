    "in recent years , continuous evolution of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) sources has resulted in a dramatic increase of brilliance with respect to older designs . among the most exciting properties of third generation facilities of today",
    "is a high flux of coherent x - rays @xcite .",
    "the availability of intense coherent x - ray beams has triggered the development of a number of new experimental techniques based on coherence properties of light such as scattering of coherent x - ray radiation , x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy and phase contrast imaging .",
    "the interested reader may find an extensive reference list to these applications in @xcite .",
    "characterization of transverse coherence properties of sr at a specimen position is fundamental for properly planning , conducting and analyzing experiments involving above - mentioned techniques .",
    "these objectives can only be met once coherence properties of undulator sources are characterized and then propagated along the photon beamline up to the specimen .",
    "this paper is mainly dedicated to a description of transverse coherence properties of sr sources .",
    "therefore , it constitutes the first step for tracking coherence properties through optical elements , which can be only done when the source is quantitatively described .",
    "solution of the problem of evolution of radiation properties in free - space is also given .",
    "this can be used to characterize radiation at the specimen position when there are no optical elements between the source and the specimen .",
    "since sr is a random process , the description of transverse coherence properties of the source and its evolution should be treated in terms of probabilistic statements .",
    "statistical optics @xcite presents most convenient tools to deal with fluctuating electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , it was mainly developed in connection with polarized thermal light that is characterized by quite specific properties .",
    "besides obeying gaussian statistics , polarized thermal light has two other specific characteristics allowing for major simplifications of the theory : stationarity and homogeneity ( i.e. perfect incoherence ) of the source @xcite .",
    "as we will see , sr obeys gaussian statistics , but stationarity and homogeneity do not belong to sr fields .",
    "thus , although the language of statistical optics must be used to describe sr sources , one should avoid a - priori introduction of an incorrect model .",
    "in contrast to this , up to now it has been a widespread practice to assume that undulator sources are perfectly incoherent ( homogeneous ) and to draw conclusions about transverse coherence properties of undulator light based on these assumptions @xcite .    in particular , in the case of thermal light",
    ", transverse coherence properties of the radiation can be found with the help of the well - known van citter - zernike ( vcz ) theorem .",
    "however , for third generation light sources either planned or in operation , the horizontal electron beam ( geometrical ) emittance rad .",
    "however , radians are a dimensionless unit . therefore , we can present emittances measured in meters .",
    "this is particularly useful in the present paper , since we need to compare emittances with radiation wavelength . ]",
    "is of order of @xmath2 nm while the vertical emittance is bound to the horizontal through a coupling factor @xmath3 , corresponding to vertical emittances of order @xmath4 .",
    "as we will show , these facts imply that the vcz theorem can not be applied in the vertical direction , aside for the hard x - ray limit at wavelengths shorter than @xmath5 .",
    "similar remarks hold for future sources , like energy recovery linac ( erl)-based spontaneous radiators .",
    "erl technology is expected to constitute the natural evolution of today sr sources and to provide nearly fully diffraction - limited sources in the @xmath6-range , capable of three order of magnitudes larger coherent flux compared to third generation light sources @xcite .",
    "horizontal and vertical emittance will be of order of @xmath7 , which rules out the applicability of the vcz theorem .",
    "the need for characterization of partially coherent undulator sources is emphasized very clearly in reference @xcite .",
    "however , studying spatial - coherence properties of undulator sources is not a trivial task .",
    "difficulties arise when one tries to simultaneously include the effect of intrinsic divergence of undulator radiation , and of electron beam size and divergence .",
    "an attempt to find the region of applicability of the vcz theorem for third generation light sources is reported in @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite conclude that the vcz theorem can only be applied when sr sources are close to the diffraction limit .",
    "we will see that the vcz theorem can only be applied in the opposite case .    a model to describe partially - coherent sources , the gaussian - schell model ,",
    "is widely used in statistical optics .",
    "its application to sr is described in @xcite .",
    "the gaussian - schell model includes non - homogeneous sources , because the typical transverse dimension of the source can be comparable or smaller than the transverse coherence length . while @xcite are of general theoretical interest , they do not provide a satisfactory approximation of third generation sr sources .",
    "in fact , as we will see , undulator radiation has very specific properties that can not be described in terms of gaussian - schell model .    the first treatment of transverse coherence properties from sr sources accounting for the specific nature of undulator radiation and anticipating operation of third generation sr facilities is given , in terms of wigner distribution , in @xcite .",
    "references @xcite present the most general algorithm for calculating properties of undulator radiation sources .    in the present paper",
    "we base our theory on the characterization of the cross - spectral density of the system .",
    "the cross - spectral density is merely the statistical correlation function of the radiation field at two different positions on the observation plane at a given frequency .",
    "it is equivalent to the wigner distribution , the two quantities being related by fourier transformation .",
    "based on cross - spectral density we developed a comprehensive theory of third generation sr sources in the space - frequency domain , where we exploited the presence of small or large parameters intrinsic in the description of the system .",
    "first , we took advantage of the particular but important situation of perfect resonance , when the field from the undulator source can be presented in terms of analytical functions .",
    "second , we exploited the practical case of a gaussian electron beam , allowing further analytical simplifications .",
    "third , we took advantage of the large horizontal emittance ( compared with the radiation wavelength ) of the electron beam , allowing separate treatments of horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "finally , we studied asymptotic cases of our theory for third generation light sources with their region of applicability .",
    "in particular , we considered both asymptotes of a small and a large vertical emittance compared with the radiation wavelength , finding surprising results . in the case of a small vertical emittance ( smaller than the radiation wavelength ) we found that the radiation is not diffraction limited in the vertical direction , an effect that can be ascribed to the influence of the large horizontal emittance on the vertical coherence properties of radiation . in the case of a large vertical emittance we described the quasi - homogeneous source in terms of a non - gaussian model , which has higher accuracy and wider region of applicability with respect to a simpler gaussian model .",
    "in fact , the non - gaussian model proposed in our work accounts for diffraction effects .",
    "nonetheless , in order to solve the propagation problem in free - space , a geometrical optics approach can still be used .",
    "we organize our work as follows .",
    "first , a general algorithm for the calculation of the field correlation function of an undulator source is given in section [ sec : due ] .",
    "such algorithm is not limited to the description of third generation light sources , but can also be applied , for example , to erl sources . in section [ sec : main ] we specialize our treatment to third generation light sources exploiting a large horizontal emittance compared to the radiation wavelength , and studying the asymptotic limit for a small vertical emittance of the electron beam . in the following section [ sec : quas ] we consider the particular case of quasi - homogeneous undulator sources , and",
    "discuss the applicability range of the van vcz theorem .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we come to conclusions .",
    "the great majority of optical sources emits thermal light . such is the case of the sun and the other stars , as well as of incandescent lamps .",
    "this kind of radiation consists of a large number of independent contributions ( radiating atoms ) and is characterized by random amplitudes and phases in space and time .",
    "its electromagnetic field can be conveniently described in terms of statistical optics that has been intensively developed during the last few decades @xcite .     light intensity from an incandescent lamp driven by a constant electric current .",
    "a statistically stationary wave has an average that does not vary with time.,width=529 ]    consider the light emitted by a thermal source passing through a polarization analyzer , as in fig .",
    "[ thermal ] .",
    "properties of polarized thermal light are well - known in statistical optics , and are referred to as properties of completely chaotic , polarized light @xcite .",
    "thermal light is a statistical random process and statements about such process are probabilistic statements .",
    "statistical processes are handled using the concept of statistical ensemble , drawn from statistical mechanics , and statistical averages are performed over an ensemble , or many realizations , or outcomes of the statistical process under study .",
    "polarized thermal sources obey a very particular kind of random process in that it is gaussian and stationary .",
    "moreover , they are homogeneous .",
    "the properties of gaussian random processes are well - known in statistical optics .",
    "for instance , the real and imaginary part of the complex amplitudes of the electric field from a polarized thermal source have gaussian distribution , while the instantaneous radiation power fluctuates in accordance with the negative exponential distribution .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that a linearly filtered gaussian process is also a gaussian random process . as a result , the presence of a monochromator and a spatial filter as in the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ thermal ] do not change the statistics of the signal .",
    "finally , higher order field correlation functions can be found in terms of the second order correlation .",
    "this dramatically simplifies the description of the random process .",
    "stationarity is a subtle concept .",
    "there are different kinds of stationarity .",
    "however , for gaussian processes different kinds of stationarity coincide @xcite . in this case",
    ", stationarity means that all ensemble averages are independent of time .",
    "it follows that a necessary condition for a certain process to be stationary is that the signal last forever . yet ,",
    "if a signal lasts much longer than the short - scale duration of the field fluctuations ( its coherence time @xmath8 ) and it is observed for a time much shorter than its duration @xmath9 , but much longer than @xmath8 it can be reasonably considered as everlasting and it has a chance to be stationary as well , as in the case of thermal light .",
    "finally , thermal sources are homogeneous .",
    "the field is correlated on the transverse direction over the possible minimal distance , which is of order of a wavelength .",
    "this means that the radiation intensity at the source remains practically unvaried on the scale of a correlation length .",
    "one can say , equivalently , that the source is homogeneous .",
    "homogeneity is the equivalent , in the transverse direction , of stationarity and implies a constant ensemble - averaged intensity along the transverse direction .",
    "consider now a sr source , as depicted subjected to random amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the radiation contains frequencies spread about the monochromator bandwidth : it is not possible , in practice , to resolve the oscillations of the radiation fields which occur at the frequency of the carrier modulation .",
    "therefore , for comparison with experimental results , we average the theoretical results over a cycle of oscillations of the carrier modulation . ] in fig .",
    "[ sr ] . like thermal light , also sr is a random process .",
    "in fact , relativistic electrons in a storage ring emit sr passing through bending magnets or undulators . the electron beam shot noise causes fluctuations of the beam density which are random in time and space from bunch to bunch . as a result ,",
    "the radiation produced has random amplitudes and phases .",
    "moreover , in section [ sub : seco ] we will demonstrate that sr fields obey gaussian statistics .",
    "statistical properties satisfied by single - electron contributions ( elementary phasors ) to the total sr field are weaker than those satisfied by single - atom contributions in thermal sources .",
    "thus , the demonstration that thermal light obeys gaussian statistics can not be directly applied to the sr case , and some condition should be formulated on the parameter space to define the region where sr is indeed a gaussian random process .",
    "we will show this fact with the help of appendix a of @xcite .",
    "in contrast with thermal light , sr is intrinsically non - stationary , because it presents a time - varying ensemble - averaged intensity on the temporal scale of the duration of the x - ray pulse generated by a single electron bunch .",
    "for this reason , in what follows the averaging brackets @xmath10 will always indicate the ensemble average over bunches ( and not a time average ) .     the intensity of an x - ray beam from a sr source .",
    "a statistically non - stationary wave has a time - varying intensity averaged over an ensemble of bunches.,width=529 ]    finally , sr sources are not completely incoherent , or homogeneous .",
    "in fact , there is a close connection between the state of coherence of the source and the angular distribution of the radiant intensity .",
    "a thermal source that is correlated over the minimal possible distance ( which is of order of the wavelength ) is characterized by a radiant intensity distributed over a solid angle of order @xmath11 .",
    "this is not the case of sr light , that is confined within a narrow cone in the forward direction .",
    "the high directionality of sr rules out the possibility of description in terms of thermal light .",
    "as we will see , depending on the situation , sr may or may not be described by a quasi - homogeneous model , where sources are only locally coherent over a distance of many wavelengths but the linear dimension of the source is much larger than the correlation distance .    in spite of differences with respect to the simpler case of thermal light , sr fields can be described in terms of statistical optics . however",
    ", statistical optics was developed in relation with thermal light emission .",
    "major assumptions typical of this kind of radiation like , for example , stationarity , are retained in textbooks @xcite .",
    "thus , usual statistical optics treatment must be modified in order to deal with sr problems .",
    "we will reduce the problem of characterization of transverse coherence properties of undulator sources in the space - frequency domain to the calculation of the correlation of the field produced by a single electron with itself .",
    "this correlation is known as cross - spectral density .",
    "the non - stationarity of the process imposes some ( practically non restrictive ) condition on the parameter space region where a treatment based on cross - spectral density can be applied to sr phenomena . such condition involves the length of the electron bunch , the number of undulator periods and the radiation wavelength . given the fact that the electron bunch length can vary from about @xmath12 ps for third generation sr sources to about @xmath13 fs for erl sources , understanding of the region of applicability this condition is a - priori not obvious .",
    "all these subjects will be treated in the next section [ sub : seco ] .      in sr experiments with third generation light sources , detectors",
    "are limited to about @xmath13 ps time resolution .",
    "therefore , they can not resolve a single x - ray pulse in time domain , whose duration is about @xmath14 ps .",
    "they work , instead , by counting the number of photons at a certain frequency over an integration time longer than the pulse .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to consider signals in the frequency domain . with this in mind , let @xmath15 be a fixed polarization component of the fourier transform of the electric field at location @xmath16 , in some cartesian coordinate system , and frequency @xmath17 by a given collection of electromagnetic sources .",
    "we will often name it , slightly improperly , `` the field '' .",
    "subscript `` b '' indicates that the field is generated by the entire bunch .",
    "@xmath18 is linked to the time domain field @xmath19 through the fourier transform    @xmath20    we will be interested in the case of an ultra relativistic electron beam going through a certain magnetic system , an undulator in particular . in this case",
    "@xmath21 is the observation distance along the optical axis of the undulator and @xmath22 fixes the transverse position of the observer .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath23-th electron to the field depends on the transverse offset @xmath24 and deflection angles @xmath25 that the electron has at some reference point on the optical axis @xmath21 , e.g. the center of the undulator . moreover , the arrival time @xmath26 at the center of the undulator has the effect of multiplying the field by a phase factor @xmath27 , i.e. the time - domain electric field is retarded by a time @xmath26 . at this point",
    "we do not need to explicitly specify the dependence on offset and deflection .",
    "the total field can be written as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath26 are random variables and @xmath30 is the number of electrons in the bunch .",
    "note that @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) is a complex quantity , that can be written as @xmath32 .",
    "it follows that the sr field pulse at fixed frequency and position is a sum of a many phasors , one for each electron , of the form @xmath33 .",
    "elementary phasors composing the sum obey three statistical properties , that are satisfied in sr problems of interest .",
    "first , random variables @xmath26 are statistically independent of each other , and of variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "second , random variables @xmath36 ( at fixed frequency @xmath17 ) , are identically distributed for all values of @xmath23 , with a finite mean @xmath37 and a finite second moment @xmath38 .",
    "these two assumptions follows from the properties of shot noise in a storage ring , which is a fundamental effect related with quantum fluctuations .",
    "third , we assume that the electron bunch duration @xmath9 is large enough so that @xmath39 : under this assumption , phases @xmath40 can be regarded as uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath41 . the assumption @xmath42 exploits the first large parameter of our theory , and is justified by the fact that @xmath17 is the undulator resonant frequency , which is high enough , in practical cases of interest , to guarantee that @xmath39 for any realistic choice of @xmath9 .",

    ", higher - order correlation functions can be expressed in terms of second - order correlation functions with the help of the moment theorem @xcite . as a result",
    ", the knowledge of the second - order field correlation function in frequency domain , @xmath45 , is all we need to completely characterize the signal from a statistical viewpoint .",

    ". however , in the case of a bending magnet one may typically have @xmath650 of order @xmath12 m and @xmath656 ( @xmath657 being the bending radius ) of order @xmath658 m. the ratio @xmath659 now constitutes an extra large parameter of the problem . in this case , even if the electron beam emittance is two order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength , due to diffraction effects one can still apply a geometrical optics approach , because @xmath660 \\cdot \\max[2 \\pi \\epsilon l_f/ ( \\beta \\lambda ) , 1 ] \\gg 1 $ ] , i.e. the photon beam emittance is much larger than the wavelength . as a result",
    ", dimensional analysis suggests that bending magnet radiation may be treated exhaustively in the framework of geometrical optics even for third generation light sources .",
    "this work presents a theory of transverse coherence properties from third generation light sources , valid while radiation evolves in free - space . besides being important for experiments involving coherence that make no use of optical elements",
    ", it constitutes the first step towards the solution of the image formation problem for undulator sources ( see @xcite ) that will be a natural follow - up to the present article .",
    "we considered synchrotron radiation ( sr ) as a random statistical process to be described using the language of statistical optics .",
    "statistical optics developed in connection with gaussian , stationary processes characterized by homogeneous sources .",
    "however , for sr , there is no a priori reason to hold these assumptions satisfied .",
    "we showed that sr is a gaussian random process . as a result",
    ", statistical properties of sr are described satisfactory by second - order field correlation functions .",
    "we focused , in particular , on undulator sources .",
    "it should be noted here that wiggler and bending magnets are still being used at third generation facilities .",
    "however , as has been remarked in the previous section [ sub : geop ] , these devices are characterized by a much shorter formation length , which allows one to apply a geometrical optics approach to describe them .",
    "thus , in this case , the formalism developed for second generation facilities can be satisfactory taken advantage of . in other words , use of wigglers and bending magnets is mainly related with applications requiring higher photon flux ( but not high coherent flux ) , compared with analogous devices installed in second generation facilities .",
    "our choice of considering undulator sources is justified by the fact that we are interested in transverse coherence properties of radiation .    with this in mind , a frequency - domain analysis was used to describe undulator sources from a mathematical viewpoint . as a consequence of the frequency domain analysis we could study the spatial correlation for a given frequency content using the cross - spectral density of the system .",
    "this can be used to extract information even if the process is non - stationary , and independently of the spectral correlation function .",
    "we gave a general expression for the cross - spectral density dependent on six dimensionless parameters .",
    "subsequently we assumed small normalized detuning from resonance , thus obtaining a simplified expression of practical relevance .",
    "we simplified our expressions further in the case of third generation light sources , based on a large horizontal emittance ( compared with the wavelength ) . in this case , the cross - spectral density can be factored in the product of a horizontal and a vertical factor .",
    "attention was subsequently drawn on the vertical cross - spectral density @xmath328 , without loss of generality .",
    "we expressed @xmath328 in terms of one - dimensional convolutions between universal functions and gaussian functions , and studied different asymptotic cases of interest .    in the case of a vertical emittance much smaller than the radiation wavelength we derived the counter - intuitive result that radiation is not fully coherent in the vertical direction .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as an influence of a large horizontal emittance on the vertical plane , and is related with the particular non - gaussian nature of the single particle field .",
    "subsequently , we studied quasi - homogeneous cases of interest , discussing the applicability of the vcz theorem for gaussian and non - gaussian quasi - homogeneous sources . finally , we discussed the accuracy of the quasi - homogeneous model .",
    "it is interesting to spend a few words about relation of our theory with numerical techniques .",
    "computer codes have been written ( see e.g. @xcite ) that deal with beamline design , based on wave - optics techniques .",
    "codes also begin to be used to treat the case of partially coherent radiation : one of their final goals is to solve the image formation problem starting from first principles .",
    "results may be obtained using numerical techniques alone , starting from the lienard - wiechert expressions for the electromagnetic field and applying the definition of the field correlation function without any analytical work .",
    "calculation of the intensity at a single point on the image plane can be approached by propagating wavefronts from different macro - particles through the entire optical system , calculating intensities and summing them up .",
    "this method is well - suited for parallel processing , and relatively easy to implement . yet , a first - principle calculation of the field correlation function between two generic points at the image plane involves very complicated and time - expensive numerical evaluations . to be specific",
    ", one needs to perform two integrations along the undulator device and four integrations over the electron - beam phase space distribution to solve the problem in free space .",
    "then , even in the simple case when the optical beamline can be modelled as a single focusing lens , other four integrations are needed to characterize coherence properties on the image plane , for a total of ten integrations .",
    "the development of a universal code for any experimental setup is then likely to be problematic .",
    "a more conservative approach may suggest the use of computer codes based on some analytical transformation of first principle equations suited for specific experimental setups . from this viewpoint our most general expressions ( or alternatively , as it is being done , expressions for the wigner distribution function )",
    "may be used as reliable basis for the development of numerical methods .",
    "our analytical theory allows treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space and their applicability region with the help of a consistent use of dimensional analysis .",
    "this physical understanding , together with the possibility of using our asymptotic results as benchmarks for numerical methods , will be of help to code writers .    in closing",
    ", as has been remarked in @xcite : `` [ ... ] it is very desirable to have a way to model the performance of undulator beamlines with significant partial coherent effects , and such modelling would , naturally , start with the source .",
    "the calculation would involve the knowledge of the partial coherence properties of the source itself and of how to propagate partially coherent fields through space and through the optical components used in the beamline .",
    "[ ... ] it is important to recognize that , although most of these calculations are , in principle , straightforward applications of conventional coherence theory ( born and wolf , 1980 ; goodman , 1985 ) , there is not much current interest in the visible optics community . '' .",
    "these statements were formulated more than ten years ago , when operation of third generation light sources started .",
    "while it was immediately recognized that usual sr theory was not adequate to describe them , no theoretical progress was made in that direction .",
    "our paper finally answers the call in @xcite .",
