    "understanding the mechanism underlying high - temperature superconductivity has remained a major challenge in condensed matter physics .",
    "since high - temperature cuprate superconductors are insulating antiferromagnets before doping , it is natural to also investigate their antiferromagnetic precursors . in particular , one may hope to identify potential mechanisms for cooper pair preformation in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "while we do not necessarily expect to unravel the relevant mechanism in this way , it motivates a careful systematic study . in previous work",
    "we have investigated the interactions between holes in lightly doped antiferromagnets , using a systematic low - energy effective field theory approach , both on the square @xcite and on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the effective theory is formulated in terms of the staggered magnetization order parameter field , whose fluctuations correspond to spinwaves ( magnons ) , and in terms of fermionic hole fields .",
    "this is in complete analogy to baryon chiral perturbation theory in particle physics , where the fluctuations in the chiral order parameter manifest themselves as pions , while baryons ( protons and neutrons ) are analogous to the doped holes @xcite .",
    "based on microscopic hubbard and @xmath1-@xmath2 models , and using a systematic low - energy expansion , we have constructed effective field theories for magnons and holes , both on the square and on the honeycomb lattice @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "one - magnon exchange mediates weak attractive forces between doped holes . as doping",
    "is increased , antiferromagnetism is weakened , and ultimately disappears as a long - range order phenomenon , when one enters the superconducting phase .",
    "still , intermediate - range antiferromagnetic correlations persist even in the superconductor , and it is interesting to ask which objects form when one is about to leave the antiferromagnetic phase . at the edge of this phase , the spin stiffness @xmath3 decreases and the energy @xmath4 of skyrmion excitations in the staggered magnetization order parameter is thus reduced .",
    "in addition , doped holes can gain energy when they localize on a topological skyrmion defect .",
    "we have systematically investigated this phenomenon as a potential mechanism for cooper pair preformation for antiferromagnets on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in this case , both one - magnon exchange and skyrmion localization lead to bound states in the same symmetry channel .",
    "the role of skyrmions in quantum antiferromagnets has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to extend the study of hole localization on a skyrmion to antiferromagnets on the honeycomb lattice , which underlies certain high - temperature superconductors , including the dehydrated version of na@xmath5coo@xmath6h@xmath5o . in this case",
    ", experiments suggest that the pairing symmetry is @xmath0-wave @xcite .",
    "@xmath7-wave pairing has also been found for other strongly correlated systems on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "as we studied earlier @xcite , in contrast to the square lattice case , on the honeycomb lattice , leading order one - magnon exchange gives rise to long - range attraction only between holes residing in different hole pockets ( characterized by the `` flavors '' @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) . as an unambiguous prediction of the effective theory , the binding occurs in the @xmath0-wave channel , and is thus indeed consistent with experiment @xcite . as we will show here , unlike in the square lattice case , on the honeycomb lattice the symmetry channels favored by hole localization on skyrmions are not in one - to - one correspondence with the symmetry channels resulting from one - magnon exchange .",
    "in particular , a skyrmion with the standard radial profile can only localize holes residing in the @xmath8-pocket , while an anti - skyrmion can only localize @xmath9-holes . while @xmath0-wave symmetry still arises , other competing pairing symmetries are possible as well . only detailed energetic considerations , which we leave for future work , can unambiguously decide which pairing mechanism is favored by skyrmion localization . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate entirely on the systematic symmetry analysis of the various hole states localized on a skyrmion .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the effective field theory formulation of antiferromagnetic magnons on the honeycomb lattice and discuss skyrmions as classical solutions",
    ". we also comment on the hopf term and on the collective modes of a rotating skyrmion which we then quantize . in section 3 , the effective field theory description is extended by introducing holes doped into the system .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the symmetry analysis of states of single holes as well as hole pairs of the same flavor , localized on a static or a rotating skyrmion . while our main focus is the symmetry analysis ,",
    "some simple energetic considerations are also discussed .",
    "while section 6 contains our conclusions , the localization of two holes with different flavor on a skyrmion is investigated in the appendix .",
