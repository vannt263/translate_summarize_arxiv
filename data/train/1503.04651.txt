    "nanoparticles with a core - shell structure are of interest for various fields of applied research .",
    "they are routinely fabricated  @xcite and have applications ranging from nanophotonics  @xcite to medical treatment .",
    "@xcite in the field of plasmonics ,  @xcite for instance , recent attention has been paid to nanoparticles having a metallic core and a dielectric shell  @xcite or vice versa .",
    "@xcite the reason is the added tunability of the optical response due to the geometry and composition of the particle .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of coated nanoparticles is that they may induce transparency in a certain range of wave numbers due to the interplay of the dipole radiations of the core and the shell .",
    "@xcite    we are interested in the scattering of light by particles with a dielectric core and a dielectric coat ( shell ) where both materials show a strong transverse optical phonon resonance giving rise to anomalous scattering in the infrared occurring for wave numbers @xmath2 where the complex dielectric function @xmath3 has @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite in our previous work  @xcite we analyzed the extinction efficiency of this type of core - shell particles with an eye on using it in a low - temperature plasma as an electric probe with an optical read - out .",
    "the idea , originally put forward for homogeneous dielectric particles ,  @xcite is to utilize the blue - shift of the anomalous dipole resonance due to the surplus electrons collected from the plasma as a diagnostics from which the charge of the particle and thus the floating potential at the particle s position in the plasma can be determined . whereas for homogeneous particles",
    "the charge - induced shift is most probably too small to be of practical importance , core - shell particles show a much larger blue shift .",
    "in particular the position of what we called shell resonance is very charge sensitive .",
    "its blue - shift should be measurable for particle radii up to @xmath6 m by infrared attenuation spectroscopy as it is typically used in plasma diagnostics .",
    "@xcite we also proposed to use dielectric particles scattering infrared light in the anomalous regime as grains in dusty plasmas and to replace traditional force - balance techniques  @xcite of determining the charge of the grains by an optical technique .",
    "the dielectric core - shell particles suggested for an optical charge measurement contain a core with negative and a shell with positive electron affinity .",
    "this particular choice of electron affinities results in a potential well which localizes the surplus electrons in the shell of the particle . compared to an homogeneous particle , where the surplus electrons are spread out over the whole particle , the volume charge density of surplus electrons is thus enhanced .",
    "it is this localization effect which already yields larger charge - induced shifts for the anomalous resonances of the core .",
    "more important however is that the core - shell structure leads also to an additional resonance not present in an homogeneous particle .",
    "@xcite within the hybridization model for the optical response of complex nanostructures  @xcite the additional resonance can be understood as the antibonding split - off of the anomalous resonance of the shell due to its mixing with a cavity mode supported by the core .",
    "the bonding partner is located at smaller wave numbers with the splitting between the bonding and the antibonding resonance controlled by the filling factor @xmath7 which is the core radius @xmath8 measured in units of the particle radius @xmath9 . in our investigations of charged core - shell particles we found the position of the antibonding dipole resonance ( which we called shell resonance ) to be particularly charge - sensitive .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to analyze the bonding and antibonding resonances showing up in dielectric core - shell particles in more detail using a neutral al@xmath0o@xmath1  particle with a caocore as an example .",
    "in addition to the results for this particular physical particle we also show results for a dissipationless model particle where the scattering anomalies can be more clearly identified .",
    "we demonstrate that the bonding as well as the antibonding resonances scatter light in the anomalous regime .",
    "this can be deduced from the inverse hierarchy of the partial extinction cross sections and the topology of the poynting vector field .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the hybridization model  @xcite we do not use the electrostatic approximation .",
    "instead we solve the full mie equations  @xcite for the core - shell particle .",
    "@xcite we can thus gain further insight into the hybridization scenario  @xcite by investigating specifically in the dipole regime the energy flux inside and outside the particle by the methods previously used for homogeneous particles .",
    "@xcite from the spatial distribution of the dissipation we can moreover identify regions inside the particle where most of the energy is deposited which may be of technological interest .",
    "@xcite dissipation depends on the character of the resonance  bonding or antibonding  and is for both cases highly inhomogeneous , varying by two orders of magnitude from one position to another .",
    "the remaining paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we recall briefly the mie theory of light scattering by core - shell particles relegating mathematical details necessary to fix our notation to an appendix . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present our results , discussing first the hierarchy of the two series of extinction resonances and then  in the dipole regime ",

    "in addition the @xmath121 isocline and @xmath122 isocline are indicated by blue and green lines .",
    "the singular points are given by the intersection of two differently colored isoclines .",
    "for wave numbers @xmath123 , for instance , in region viii , the poynting flux in the vicinity of the particle shows a dipole radiation oriented opposite to the incident light which is propagating in @xmath12-direction . as an illustration of this behavior we plotted in the upper right panel of fig .",

    "it contains two singular points , one in the upper and one in the lower half of the @xmath102-plane . at the saddle point d in the lower half plane ( replotted on a magnified scale in the inset )",
    "it can be nicely seen that the energy flux emitted by the particle due to the excited dipoles is oriented oppositely to the incident energy flux .",
    "the field lines emitted by the particle ( positive @xmath125-component ) and the field lines from the incoming wave ( negative @xmath125-component ) meet at this point and are then bend over to flow towards plus or minus @xmath13 . in the upper half - plane , that is for @xmath126 , the poynting flux either passes by or is reabsorbed by the particle .",
    "this can be seen at point c , which is the bohren saddle point ,  @xcite where the field lines coming from @xmath127 are going behind the particle ( positive @xmath125-component ) or towards it ( negative @xmath125-component ) .",
    "the saddle points c and d reflect the strength of the energy flow of the resonant excitation relative to the strength of the energy flow of the incoming light .",
    "thus , these points can disappear if the dipoles are not emitting enough energy , as it can happen if the damping inside the particle is too large .    on the high energy side of the resonance , for wave numbers @xmath128 , the dipoles radiate energy parallel to the incident light .",
    "the poynting flux thus gets more complicated .",
    "for example in the topological region iii , at @xmath129 , six singular points , four saddle points a , b , c , d , and two foci points e and f ( in three dimensions these are saddle - focus points ) arise , all located in the upper half of the @xmath102-plane ( see lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ sraussen ] ) .",
    "there are no singular points anymore for @xmath130 .",
    "since the excited dipoles changed simultaneously their directions the @xmath125-component of the poynting vector is always negative for @xmath130 , that is , the energy flux along the @xmath12-axis is oriented towards the particle .",
    "one of the @xmath121 isoclines at which a change of sign in the @xmath125-component occurs is located above the particle at @xmath131 and so is now the saddle point d. at this point the field lines emitted by the particle and thus having a positive @xmath125-component and the field lines coming from the foci points e and f and heading towards the particle owing to the negative @xmath125-component meet and take their way towards plus and minus @xmath13 .",
    "this is quite similar to the situation at point d in region viii , since the foci points can be regarded as sources of energy in the @xmath102-plane .",
    "@xcite at the bohren saddle point c the field lines come together from the left and right focus and then they either go behind the particle or towards it , as they did in region viii . at @xmath132",
    "there are two saddle points a and b. to understand their functioning lets take a look along the @xmath122 isocline . for @xmath130 field lines which cross the @xmath133 isocline enter the particle while field lines crossing the @xmath133 isocline for @xmath131 leave the particle .",
    "thus , at the singular points a and b field lines leaving or entering the particle come close together and form a saddle point .    some wave numbers away from @xmath134 , in region i , only the saddle points a and b remain as can be seen in the panel on the lower right of fig .",
    "[ sraussen ] where the poynting flux is plotted for @xmath135 . if we would plot separatrixes inside the circle defined by the @xmath133 isocline we would find tribelsky ears .",

    "but for @xmath131 the @xmath121 isocline disappeared . as a result",
    ", there are no further singular points other than a and b.        a comparison of our results for the poynting flux near the antibonding dipole resonance of a core - shell particle with the results found by tribelsky and lukyanchuk  @xcite near the anomalous resonance of a homogeneous particle shows that the topologies are the same .",
    "the same pattern arises also around the bonding dipole resonance .",
    "hence , the changes in the anomalous topology of the poynting flux appear for a core - shell particle around two wave numbers . by just looking at the energy distribution outside the particle",
    "one could not distinguish between a core - shell and an homogeneous particle .",
    "although in the first case two dipoles emit energy , which may have parallel or antiparallel orientation , depending on whether one is close to the bonding or close to the antibonding dipole resonance , whereas in the second case the energy is emitted only by one dipole .",
    "the core - shell structure of the particle reveals itself in the energy flux inside the particle .",
    "the reason is the relative orientation of the inner and the outer dipole .",

    "at present it suffices to recall the polarity of the surface polarization charges shown in fig .",
    "[ surfacemode ] from which the orientation of the dipoles can be also deduced . unlike the poynting flux outside the particle , which arises from the superposition of the incoming field with an effective overall dipole field of the particle , inside the core - shell particle the energy fluxes of two dipoles which are either parallel ( bonding ) or antiparallel ( antibonding ) mix .",
    "as explained at the beginning of this section in the dipole regime the singular points of the poynting flux are all located in the @xmath102-plane .",

    "it is instructive to trace the direction of the whirlpools to the orientation of the inner and the outer dipole .",
    "the polarity of the surface charges at the two interfaces as well as the electric field lines to be presented in sec .  [ efield ] show that at the antibonding resonance the two dipoles are antiparallel .",
    "hence , in the shell region the electric field lines belonging to the outer and the inner dipole are parallel . in the vicinity of the whirlpools",

    "the poynting flux shows that the particle is emitting and reabsorbing light to - and - fro the outside region . in the vicinity of the core the poynting flux in the shell resembles the flux around an excited dipole .",
    "the core is emitting energy into the shell and is also reabsorbing energy from it .",
    "the singular points inside the shell arise therefore from an interference between the electromagnetic fields of an inner and an outer dipole .",
    "in region viii the saddle point k arises from field lines emitted from and reabsorbed by the outer dipole meeting field lines which are emitted from the inner dipole .",

    "occurs as the outgoing field lines from the inner dipole cancel the inner field lines of the outer dipole . at @xmath166 and @xmath167 , on the other hand , constructive interference occurs , because outer field lines of the inner dipole and inner field lines of the outer dipole run parallel leading to a high electric field . at the antibonding resonance shown in panel ( d ) the shell - core interface in the @xmath163 hemisphere is a sink for field lines while in the @xmath164 hemisphere it is a source .",

    "the inhomogeneity of the electric field can be used to control the dissipation of energy inside a core - shell particle by varying the wavelength of the incident light . for the model particle discussed in this subsection",

    "in our previous work we proposed to use the antibonding dipole resonance of dielectric core - shell particles having a core with negative and a shell with positive electron affinity to determine by infrared attenuation spectroscopy the number of surplus electrons of the particle . due to the particular choice of the electron affinities the electrons",
    "would be confined to the shell region leading to a high volume electron density which in turn would strongly affect the electric polarizability of the particle and hence the position of the extinction resonances .",
    "in particular the maximum of the antibonding dipole resonance , which we initially called shell resonance since it is absent for homogeneous particles , turned out to be very charge sensitive . to understand the mechanism leading to this resonance and also to make contact to the field of plasmonics , we investigated in the present work neutral dielectric core - shell particles , using a cao / al@xmath0o@xmath1  particle as a physical example and a dissipationless model core - shell particle as an idealized system .",

    "we also analyzed the topology of the poynting flux in the vicinity of the bonding and the antibonding dipole resonance .",
    "the outside poynting flux near these two resonances is determined by an effective dipole describing the effective outer field of the inner and outer dipole .",
    "the topology of the outside poynting flux is thus for the bonding and antibonding resonance similar to the poynting flux of an homogeneous particle .",
