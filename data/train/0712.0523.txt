    "accretion of gas onto smbhs is powering the huge energy output from quasars , but smbh formation and quasar s lifetime remain open in this well - established paradigm .",
    "the elegant idea , comparing the total accreted mass density during the active phases with the local mass density of smbhs in normal galaxies ( 1982 , hereafter argument ) , has been examined in detail from quasar lf ( chokshi & turner 1992 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) and x - ray background ( marconi et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this generally convinces us that accretion during their episodic activities is the main source of mass growth .",
    "however , the smbh growth at different redshifts remains open .    in the present paper",
    ", we make an attempt to develop an efficient way to estimate the duty cycle for high redshifts , offering a new clue to understand smbh growth at different redshifts .",

    "the smbh mass function at redshift @xmath12 in active and dormant galaxies is @xmath13 , the duty cycle is defined as a fraction of active black holes to the total , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is black hole mass and @xmath16 is the mass function of black holes in quasars at a redshift @xmath12 .",
    "the averaged duty cycle is @xmath17 in term of the number density , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the lower mass limit of smbhs in the sample . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the mass - weighted duty cycle is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath24 in wang et al .",
    "( 2006c ) , namely @xmath25 eq . ( 2 ) involves that the mean masses of active and inactive black holes are equal , and then converts the number density to mass density ratio ( wang et al .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath26 represents the duty cycle of the major population of smbhs at a given redshift .",
    "we get the mass density of black holes from quasar lf if we assume a constant @xmath27 of quasars as in literatures ( e.g. marconi et al .",
    "2004 , but see evidence for this in kollmeier et al .",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate is defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is accretion rates of black holes , @xmath30 the critical rate , @xmath31 the eddington luminosity , @xmath32 gyr the salpeter time , @xmath33 the thomson scattering section , @xmath34 the light speed , @xmath35 the gravity constant and @xmath36 the proton mass . with the help of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radiative efficiency and quasar lf , we have the black hole mass density in active galaxies at redshift @xmath12 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean dimensionless accretion rate , and the luminosity density is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bolometric lf , @xmath43 the bolometric luminosity , and @xmath44 its corresponding limit .",

    "information on @xmath45 can be estimated from the reionization of the universe .",
    "the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) detected a large optical depth to thomson scattering , @xmath52 , and suggests that the reionization happened at much higher redshift @xmath53 ( spergel et al .",
    "madau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the reionization may be powered by mini - quasars , which have a mass density of accreting black holes at least @xmath54 , which roughly agrees with that extrapolated by the luminosity function used below .",
    "we take @xmath55 and @xmath56 in this paper .",
    "we would like to point out followings : 1 ) the approximation is accurate enough within a certain redshift @xmath57 when @xmath45 can be neglected and baryon accretion dominates .",

    "quasars with redshifts of @xmath67 have a mean eddington ratio of @xmath68 with a scatter of 0.3 dex , namely , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , using the empirical reverberation relation ( kollmeier et al .",
    "fig 1_b _ shows the duty cycle of quasars ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 for @xmath73 , respectively .    from fig .",
    "1_b _ , we find that there is a gradual decrease of @xmath59 from high redshifts to @xmath1 and then dramatically evolves going down to @xmath74 in the local universe .",
    "the duty cycle below @xmath75 is similar to the results from wang et al .",
    "( 2006c ) . comparing with the cosmic history of sfr density , we find @xmath59 has very similar evolutionary trend .",
    "exhaustion of gas leads to lower @xmath76 , so does the fueling gas to smbhs .",
    "this strong evolution is thus regarded as the lack of fueling gas , consequently , most smbhs are then starving .",

    "2005 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] 0.3 cm    beyond redshift @xmath1 , the trends of @xmath59 and @xmath76 are just opposite as shown in fig 1_b_. the present @xmath59 at high redshifts agree very well with the duty cycle estimated from clustering of high redshift quasars ( @xmath77 ) by shen et al .",
    "the duty cycle gradually decreases from high to low redshifts while @xmath76 slowly increases . during this epoch",
    "there is enough gas for both star formation and accretion onto smbhs .",
    "we note that the strong feedback of black hole activities ( schawinski et al .",
    "2006 ; wang et al .",
    "2007 ) is driving to blow away fueling gas so as to switch off quasars ( di matteo et al .",
    "it has been found by peng et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mclure et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that quasars at @xmath1 have stellar mass less than expected from the local magorrian relation .",
    "this also is indicated by the broken relation between star formation and agn activity at high luminosities ( maiolino et al .",
    "2007 ) , suggesting the smbhs are growing faster than star formation at high redshifts in the presence of strong feedback of black hole activity . on the other hand",
    ", one can check if the star formation still obeys the kennicutt - schmidt s law as done in seyfert galaxies ( wang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is expected that further evidence for the evolution of the feedback is to search from statistics at high redshifts .",
    "future high spatial resolution observations of alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) will directly uncover the detailed nature of feedback .",
    "the net lifetime of quasars ( i.e. the total over the hubble time ) is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the cosmic time .",
    "2_a _ shows the net lifetimes for quasars with different accretion rates . for the rate @xmath80",
    ", we find the typical value is @xmath81yrs for @xmath2 .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2004 ) obtained a lifetime of a few @xmath82yrs , based on @xmath83 , which agrees with our results for the same @xmath27 . if a single episodic lifetime is measured from the transverse proximity effect ( goncalves et al .",
    "2007 ) , the cycles of episodic activities can be estimated .",
    "the cutoff around @xmath84 in fig .",
    "2_a _ is caused by setting the birth of quasars at this epoch .",
    "neglecting mergers , we have the conserved number density in the co - moving frame as @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the smbh mass density and mean mass in the local universe .",
    "this is justified by the results from detailed numerical simulations , which show the mass contributed from major mergers is only roughly a few percent after @xmath88 epoch ( volonteri et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the mass density of the local smbhs is given by @xmath89 ( shankar et al .",
    "2004 ; marconi et al .",
    "we convert the function of dispersion velocity [ @xmath90 of early type galaxies ( sheth et al .",

    "we thus have the mean mass of black holes at @xmath12 @xmath94\\langle\\mbh^0\\rangle.\\ ] ] fig .",

    "if future observations could provide the mean mass of smbh [ @xmath95 for a complete sample at a given redshift , it becomes feasible to justify if the non - baryon accretion onto the black holes is necessary by a simple comparison of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    from eq .",
    "( 8) , we have the mean mass of seed black holes @xmath98 where we use @xmath45 limited by the wmap .",
    "it should be noted that the real @xmath99 could be smaller than the given by eq .",
    "( 10 ) if stars partially ionize the universe .",
    "the value of @xmath99 agrees well with the black hole mass of the mini - quasar model in madau et al .",
    "how to form such a massive seed black hole at @xmath5 remains open from the primordial at @xmath100 .",
    "[ fig2 ] 0.3 cm    the primordial black holes can be generally produced by the collapse of population iii stars ( madau et al . 2001 ) , or collapse of primordial gas clouds ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ; loeb et al .",

    "this is only moderate super - eddington and is realistic in high redshift universe .",
    "the photon trapping effects make the accretion have low radiative efficiency , but disks of the black holes radiate at a level of @xmath109 ( wang et al .",
    "1999 ; wang & zhou 1999 ; ohsuga et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we note that this conclusion is inconsistent with that in volonteri & rees ( 2005 , hereafter vr05 ) .",
    "vr05 suggested that a highly super - eddington accretion onto primordial black holes between @xmath110 to form seed black holes of @xmath4 in term of the bondi accretion ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) , and subsequently the seeds gradually grow up to be a @xmath111 smbh until @xmath112 . using the bondi rate , we obtain @xmath113 $ ] , where @xmath114 is the initial mass of a primordial black hole in units of solar mass , @xmath115 and @xmath116gyr , @xmath117 is the number density of ambient medium , @xmath118 the sound speed of the medium , @xmath119k the temperature of the medium and @xmath120 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the rate @xmath27 goes to @xmath121 , even infinity for a critical time of @xmath122 , before the bondi radius is larger than the typical dimension of the primordial clouds ( vr05 ) .",
    "the classical bondi accretion is valid provided the growth timescale of the accreting black hole , @xmath123 is much longer than the gaseous dynamical @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the bondi radius . under the environment in high redshift universe",
    ", we have @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",
    "this directly indicates that the bondi approximation is broken for a rapid growth of the primordials .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of time - dependent bondi accretion onto a growing black hole is needed for such a context .",
    "on the other hand , the rapid growth through super - eddington accretion with the bondi rates in vr05 is suffering from strong feedback from outflow or compton heating ( wang et al .",
    "the strength of feedback depends on the angular momentum of the primordial gas accreted onto the black hole .",
    "a potentially efficient way to avoid the strong feedback is that the primordial gas has angular momentum large enough to extend the outer radius of the accretion disk so as to suppress the feedback due to the compton heating .",
    "a moderate super - eddington accretion is thus feasible to form a seed black hole from the primordial during the period of @xmath8 to 17 .",
    "we develop a convenient way to calculate the duty cycle based on lf , which applies to any redshifts .",
    "we find that the trends of the duty cycle and the cosmic history of the sfr density are just opposite when @xmath128 .",

    ", the net lifetime of quasars can be obtained from the quasar luminosity function .",
