    "the influence of the environment on a quantum system is an issue of crucial importance in quantum information science .",
    "it is mainly attributed to decoherence ( dephasing ) , which transforms asymptotically any initial state of the quantum system into a statistical mixture by tracing out the environmental states in the overall density matrix @xcite .",
    "the decoherence rate is a basic quantity characterizing the loss of information stored in the quantum system .",
    "in fact , this information is not totally lost , even in the asymptotic limit ",
    "it is hidden in the environment .",
    "it can be retrieved by a detector that monitors the environment . such a detector can be placed far away from the quantum system , so that it does not interact with the system directly .",
    "the question we address is whether such an information retrieval could influence the decoherence rate of the quantum system . beyond its fundamental interest ,",
    "this question is important for a number of applications , for instance quantum cryptography @xcite . indeed , if the decoherence rate is increased by the retrieval of information from the environment , it would betray the fact that the system is being monitored by an outside observer .",
    "it is widely accepted that one can not make a measurement without perturbing the system @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , how to make this statement quantitative .",
    "for instance , how is the decoherence rate related to the information gain ?",
    "even the main premise , that the measurement _ always _ perturbs the system , is still not proven .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that , contrary to the common assumption , an indirect measurement of an open quantum system can _ reduce _ its decoherence rate .",
    "this implies that one can gain information regarding such a system without adding to the disturbance due to the environment , or even diminishing the environmental effects .",
    "this peculiar result is a consequence of a large - scale quantum interference effect that weakens local environmental noise near the quantum system .",
    "these questions of decoherence and information retrieval from the environment are parts of a more general problem : what constitutes the environment for the purpose of decoherence . indeed , any device monitoring the environment can be considered a part of the environment and then it must be taken into account in evaluating the decoherence rate .",
    "then the same question arises on the next level , regarding devices coupled to the previous set .",
    "this will inevitably lead us to the von neumann hierarchy problem  a system measured by another system and so forth @xcite  and its relevance to decoherence .    in this paper",
    "we do not deal with this fundamental problem in its full complexity , but restrict ourselves to the first `` level . ''",
    "we therefore consider a two - state quantum system ( qubit ) coupled to the environment , which does not measure the qubit , but causes its parameters to fluctuate .",
    "then we introduce a distant device ( detector ) , monitoring the environment and indirectly the qubit . for a consistent analysis of this problem",
    "it is necessary to treat it entirely quantum mechanically , as the schrdinger evolution of a many - body system , without any _ ad hoc _ `` classical '' or `` stochastic '' assumptions .",
    "one can invent models for the fluctuating environment and the measuring devices that are simple enough to allow full quantum mechanical analysis .",
    "such models , however , have to reflect generic features of real fluctuating environments and devices , for instance as considered in `` control dephasing '' experiments @xcite .",
    "are the chemical potentials of the reservoirs .",
    "the electric current @xmath0 through the set makes the energy level @xmath1 of the qubit fluctuate.,width=188 ]    for this reason we represent the fluctuating environment by a single - electron transistor ( set ) capacitively coupled to the qubit @xcite , fig .",
    "such a setup has been contemplated in numerous solid state quantum computing architectures @xcite and contains most of the generic features of a fluctuating non - equilibrium environment @xcite .",
    "the discreteness of the electron charge creates fluctuations in the electrostatic field near the set .",
    "if the electrostatic qubit is placed near the set , this fluctuating field affects the qubit by making its energy levels fluctuate , as shown in fig .",
    "nonetheless , since the energy level @xmath2 of the set is deep inside the voltage bias , the set s current and the fluctuation spectrum of the electric charge inside it are not modulated by the qubit @xcite .",
    "thus such a setup represents the fluctuating ( telegraph ) noise acting on the qubit with no back - action @xcite .",
    "the total current through the set does not contain any information regarding the qubit state .",
    "the _ energy resolved _ current in the reservoir , on the other hand , does carry such information .",
    "the energy distribution of the resonant current through the level @xmath2 is given by a lorentzian centered at @xmath2 .",
    "if the qubit s electron occupies the level @xmath1 , the center of the lorentzian is shifted by the coulomb repulsion between the two electrons relative to the case when the qubit s electron occupies the lower dot .",
    "this implies that by measuring the energy - resolved current through the set , one can monitor the qubit s state .",
    "such an indirect measurement of the qubit can be performed , for instance , by placing another set at some distance from the first one , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this case the right reservoir ( collector ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] becomes the middle reservoir , separating the two sets in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as a result ,",
    "the total current in the right reservoir ( @xmath3 ) becomes dependent on the difference @xmath4 : it peaks@xcite when the levels are aligned , @xmath5 .",
    "if the upper dot of the qubit is occupied , the levels @xmath6 are effectively misaligned due to coulomb interaction of the qubit with the left set .",
    "then the current passing the second set drops , thus indicating that the upper dot of the qubit is occupied . in this way",
    "the information on the qubit s state , stored in the energy - resolved current , becomes available .     in the right - hand reservoir ( the lead )",

    "this information is encoded in the qubit s `` phase '' , i.e. in the basis representing a _ coherent superposition _ of the qubit s dot - occupation states . since the measurement of the qubit via @xmath3 , fig .",

    "the occupation in the steady state is given by @xmath145 . in the case of a symmetric left - hand set , @xmath146",
    ", we find @xmath147 .",
    "the presence of the second set ( @xmath148 ) leads to @xmath149 .",
    "it looks as if the first set were less strongly coupled to the reservoir , @xmath150 . as a result , the charge correlator ( [ ac1 ] ) of the left dot , given by @xmath151 , drops",
    "this demonstrates explicitly that an increase of the set s occupation diminishes the corresponding charge correlator .",
    "now it remains to understand how a distant right - hand set can increase the average occupation of the left - hand set .",
    "this is an effect of quantum interference on large scales , which already appears in the motion of a single electron between two quantum wells separated by the reservoir ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this problem has been recently investigated in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated there that in the case of aligned levels , @xmath5 , an electron initially localized in the left - hand well can be found as @xmath61 inside the the same well with probability @xmath152 .",
    "this implies that in the limit of @xmath153 the electron does not decay to the continuum , but remains locked in the left - hand well .",
    "this phenomenon is a result of quantum interference between two distant localized states .",
    "keeping in mind the increase in occupation of the left - hand set generated by the distant right - hand set in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we can understand the difference in occupation of the left - hand set displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) for the setup of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the case of @xmath143 ,",
    "the probability of penetration through the right - hand set is suppressed .",
    "therefore the right - hand set can be considered as separated from the right lead . in this case",
    "it will resemble the setup of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where the right well prevents decay of the left well to the middle reservoir for @xmath153 , as explained in ref .",
    "[ ] in great detail . if however @xmath154 , then the penetration of the right - hand set is maximal . in this case",
    "it can not be considered as detached from the right - hand reservoir . as a result",
    "the right - hand set can not hinder the decay of the electron from the left set s quantum dot to the continuum , so that one can not expect a substantial increase of occupation of the left set .",
    "using these arguments one can understand the behavior of @xmath77 with @xmath83 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , and therefore the surprising behavior of the decoherence rate , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated how the retrieval of information from the environment of a quantum system affects the decoherence of the quantum system . for this purpose",
    "we considered an electrostatic qubit interacting with a fluctuating environment .",
    "the latter is represented by a current flowing through an set near the qubit .",
    "the fluctuating charge inside the set produces telegraph noise that affects the qubit s parameters .",
    "this generates decoherence , which causes information on the qubit s state to dissolve in the environment . for its retrieval",
    ", we introduce a distant set that measures the environment . solving the schrdinger equation for the entire system and tracing out the environmental states",
    ", we evaluate the decoherence rate of the qubit in the presence of the second set ( measurement ) or without it ( no measurement ) .    in principle , as a result of decoherence , the information of the qubit s state is already lost in the environment before it is measured .",
    "hence , one might assume that the actual measurement of the environment would not affect the decoherence rate of the qubit .",
    "our analysis , however , shows that this is not the case : the actual retrieval of the qubit s information from the environment does affect the qubit s decoherence rate .",
    "contrary to the common premise that any measurement can only increase decoherence , we find that the measurement can diminish the decoherence rate as well .",
    "this can be interpreted as a result of destructive interference between the measuring device and the environment , leading to reduction of the local noise near the qubit .",
    "our analysis does not point to a general relation between the decoherence rate and the information gain . on the other hand , we find that the decoherence rate is determined by the local environmental noise , even in the case of indirect measurements .",
    "this is true even beyond the weak coupling limit . in particular , a decrease of decoherence rate",
    "is always accompanied by a similar decrease of the local noise generated by the second set .",
    "we suggested an interpretation of this effect as a manifestation of quantum interference on large scales , discussed in a previous publication .",
    "we consider this work to be a first step in the investigation of indirect quantum measurements and decoherence .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend this research to different environments , where , for instance , the information regarding a quantum system is carried by emitted photons .",
    "we also expect that the effect of diminishing the decoherence ( or the noise ) with a distant detector , predicted in this paper , can be realized in various quantum systems and could then find various applications .",
