    "a qcd sum - rule calculation of hadron parameters @xcite involves two steps : ( i ) one calculates the operator product expansion ( ope ) series for a relevant correlator and formulates the sum rule which relates this ope to the sum over hadronic states , and ( ii ) one extracts the parameters of the ground state by some numerical procedure .",
    "each of these steps leads to uncertainties in the final result .",
    "the first step lies fully within qcd and allows for a rigorous treatment of the uncertainties : the correlator in qcd is not known precisely ( because of uncertainties in quark masses , condensates , @xmath0 , radiative corrections , etc . ) but the corresponding errors in the correlator may be controlled systematically ( at least in principle ) .",
    "the second step lies beyond qcd and is more cumbersome : even if several terms of the ope for the correlator were known precisely , the hadronic parameters may be extracted from a sum rule only with limited accuracy  the corresponding error has to be treated as a systematic error of the employed method .    in this letter",
    ", we continue our study of the systematic errors of hadron parameters obtained from dispersive sum rules . in an earlier analysis",
    "@xcite we addressed the determination of the decay constant of the ground state by means of the two - point correlator . here , we consider the extraction of the ground - state form factor from the three - point correlator in a quantum - mechanical harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential model .",
    "this simple model has strong advantages compared to more complicated cases : ( i ) it enables one to calculate the exact three - point function , and thus to generate the ope to any order , and ( ii ) the bound - state parameters ( masses , wave functions , form factors ) are known precisely .",
    "therefore , we may apply the standard sum - rule machinery to extract the form factor of the ground state and then compare it with the known exact form factor . in this way , we may probe the accuracy and reliability of the method .",
    "( for a discussion of many aspects of sum rules in quantum mechanics , we refer to @xcite . )",
    "we present an explicit example of the form factor extracted at a specific value of the momentum transfer , for which the exact correlator is described by the ope with better than 1% accuracy and standard sum - rule techniques yield a form factor extremely stable in the borel window .",
    "however , the value obtained from the sum - rule analysis differs from the exact value by more than 10% .",
    "we therefore reinforce our previous statement that the standard procedures adopted in the method of sum rules do not allow one to obtain rigorous error estimates for the ground - state characteristics . in the case of form factors extracted from three - point correlators ,",
    "the uncontrolled systematic errors may be considerably larger than those found in the case of decay constants extracted from two - point sum rules .",
    "we consider a nonrelativistic model hamiltonian @xmath1 with a ho interaction potential @xmath2 , @xmath3 : @xmath4 the full green function @xmath5 and the free green function @xmath6 are related by @xmath7 the solution @xmath8 of this relation may be easily found by constructing its expansion in powers of the interaction @xmath9 : @xmath10 in our ho model , all characteristics of the bound states are easily calculable .",
    "for instance , for the ground state  ( @xmath11 ) one finds , with @xmath12 @xmath13 where the elastic form factor of the ground state , @xmath14 is defined according to @xmath15 and the current operator @xmath16 is given by the kernel @xmath17",
    "the polarization operator @xmath18 is used in the sum - rule approach for the extraction of the wave function at the origin ( i.e. , of the decay constant )  of  the ground state @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the corresponding procedure for the ho model was presented in @xcite . for  the  ho potential , the analytic expression for @xmath19 is known @xcite : @xmath20^{3/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the ope series is the expansion of the exact quantity at small euclidean time @xmath21 ( or , equivalently , in powers of @xmath22 ) : @xmath23",
    "the basic quantity for the extraction of the form factor in the method of dispersive sum rules is the correlator of three currents @xcite .",
    "the analogue of this quantity in quantum mechanics is @xmath24 [ with the operator @xmath16 defined in ( [ j ] ) ] and its double borel ( laplace ) transform under @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 for large @xmath28 and @xmath29 the correlator is dominated by the ground state : @xmath30 let us notice the ward identity which relates the vertex function at zero momentum to the polarization operator : @xmath31 this expression follows directly from the relation @xmath32 in ho model , we find the exact analytic expression for @xmath33 by using the results for the green function in configuration space @xmath34 from @xcite . for our further investigation",
    ", we consider the vertex function for equal times @xmath35 which has the following explicit form : @xmath36^{3/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{q^2}{4m\\omega } \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\omega t}{2}\\right)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlator is a function of two dimensionless variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let us now construct for @xmath39 the analogue of the ope as used in the method of three - point sum rules in qcd .",
    "the corresponding procedure consists of two steps : first , we expand @xmath40 in powers of @xmath41 and obtain @xmath42 each term in this expansion can be computed from the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "expansion of the correlator @xmath43 in powers of the interaction.,width=453 ]    this is , however , not the full story : in three - point sum rules one works with local condensates and , therefore , has for each @xmath44 , @xmath45 a power - series expansion in @xmath21 . to keep the same track ,",
    "we expand @xmath44 , @xmath45 in powers of @xmath21 .    in applications ,",
    "we keep the terms @xmath46 and omit higher - order terms ; we then obtain the power corrections by expanding @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in powers of @xmath21 retaining terms up to order @xmath50 .    as the result of this procedure , the analogue of the ope for @xmath40 takes the form @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we display here only terms up to @xmath52 in @xmath53 but in calculations retain terms up to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these terms , as well as higher - order terms , may be easily generated from the exact expression ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the coefficients of each power of @xmath56 in the square brackets of ( [ gammaope ] ) are polynomials in @xmath57 of order @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , if the momentum @xmath59 increases , one needs to include more and more power corrections in order to have a certain accuracy of the truncated ope series for @xmath40 . in qcd , this implies the necessity to know  and include condensates of higher dimensions and restricts the applicability of three - point sum rules to the region of  not  too large @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ plot:2.1 ] demonstrates the behaviour of the exact correlator and the truncated ope series as described above for a fixed momentum transfer @xmath60 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     first , let us determine the `` fiducial '' interval ( or `` window '' ) of @xmath21 by the following two requirements : ( i ) the truncated ope gives an approximation to the exact @xmath40 with , say , an accuracy better than 1% .",
    "this yields @xmath61 .",
    "( ii ) the ground state gives a sizeable contribution of , say , more than 50% to the correlator .",
    "this leads to @xmath62 .",
    "so the `` window '' where we will work to extract the ground - state form factor is @xmath63 .",
    "next , we need to impose a criterion in order to fix @xmath64 .",
    "a widely used procedure is the following @xcite : one calculates @xmath65 which depends on @xmath21 because of the approximation @xmath66 ( for details , consult @xcite ) .",
    "then , one determines  @xmath64 such that the function @xmath67 has a horizontal tangent @xmath68 , see fig .",
    "[ plot:2.3]a .",
    "this gives @xmath69 , which is used to calculate the form factor via eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) by the replacement @xmath70 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ plot:2.3]b .",
    "the form factor is perfectly flat in the borel window but nevertheless turns out to be by more than 10% lower than the known true value . for comparison ,",
    "we present in figs .",
    "[ plot:2.3]c , d the corresponding plots for @xmath71 extracted from the sum rule for @xmath19 from @xcite .",
    "clearly , the general picture in both cases is similar but the deviation from the exact result is much greater for the form factor than for the decay constant .    let us emphasize a rather dangerous point : ( i ) a perfect description of @xmath72 with better than 1% accuracy in the `` window '' , ( ii ) the deviation of @xmath67 from @xmath73 at the level of only 1% , and ( iii ) a very good stability of @xmath74 with better than 1% in the full `` window '' lead to an error of more than 10% in the extracted value of @xmath75 !",
    "clearly , this error could not be guessed on the basis of the other numbers obtained : the full picture mimics a very accurate extraction of the form factor , which is , however , certainly not the case .",
    "let us summarize the lessons one should learn from our analysis :    \\1 .",
    "the knowledge of the correlator in a limited range of relatively small euclidean times ( that is , large  borel masses ) is not sufficient for the determination of the ground - state parameters . as a consequence , a sum - rule extraction of the ground - state parameters _ without knowing the contribution of the hadronic continuum",
    "_ suffers from uncontrolled systematic uncertainties .",
    "\\2 . modeling the hadron continuum by a _",
    "borel - parameter - independent _ effective continuum threshold @xmath64 allows one to fix this quantity @xmath64 by , e.g. , requiring the average energy @xmath76 to be close to @xmath73 in the borel window . in this case",
    ", however , the error of the extracted ground - state parameter turns out to be typically much larger than        \\3 .",
    "it is important to realize that the borel stability of the extracted ground - state parameter  the standard criterion that is believed to control both the reliability and the accuracy of the extracted ground - state parameter  does not in fact guarantee the extraction of its true value .      the impossibility to control , at present , the systematic errors of the extracted hadron parameters is the weak feature of the sum - rule method and an obstacle for using the results from qcd sum rules for precision physics , such as electroweak physics .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the obtained quantitative estimates .",
    "in ho model , the ground state is well separated from the first excitation , which contributes to the correlator , by a large gap of @xmath77 .",
    "this makes the ho model a very favourable case for the application of sum rules . whether or not a comparable accuracy may be achieved in qcd , where this feature is absent , is questionable .",
