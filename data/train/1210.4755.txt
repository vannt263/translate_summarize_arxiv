    "using @xmath12 collision data at @xmath13 center of mass energy , the lhcb collaboration  @xcite has reported the existence of two narrow states observed in the @xmath14 spectrum , with masses @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "these states are interpreted as the orbitally - excited @xmath4 and @xmath5 bottom baryon resonances , with spin ",
    "parity @xmath2 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the limits on the natural widths of these states are @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "there exists an old prediction by capstick and isgur for the masses of these two @xmath10 resonances which is in very good agreement with the results reported by the lhcb collaboration . indeed , their relativistic quark model predicts @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the masses of the lightest orbitally - excited states  @xcite .",
    "however , the same model yields a mass of the ground state @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) which is about @xmath24 smaller than the measured value  @xcite .",
    "more recently , garcilazo et al .  @xcite have also presented results from a constituent quark model scheme .",
    "they adjusted the mass of the @xmath22 ground state and predicted the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitally excited @xmath10 states , which turned out to be around @xmath25 @xmath26 lower than the lhcb experimental values .",
    "note however that the masses predicted in  @xcite are in turn 20-@xmath27 higher than those obtained in other schemes based also on the relativistic quark model @xcite , or on the color hyperfine interaction @xcite or on the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , in @xcite heavy baryonic resonances @xmath10 ( @xmath28 ) with @xmath17 are studied in a constituent quark model as a molecular state composed by nucleons and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) mesons .    in this work",
    "we adopt a different approach and describe these odd parity excited states as dynamically generated resonances obtained within a unitarized meson - baryon coupled - channel scheme .",
    "it is known that some baryon states can be constructed as a @xmath31 state in a quark model , and simultaneously as a dynamically generated resonance in a meson - baryon coupled - channel description ( that is a @xmath32 molecular state ) @xcite .",
    "though , some of their properties might differ .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider both points of view in order to get in the future a joint or integral description of hadronic resonances in terms of quarks and hadrons degrees of freedom .",
    "the unitarization in coupled - channels has proven to be very successful in describing some of the existing experimental data .",
    "such studies include approaches based on the chiral perturbation theory amplitudes for scattering of @xmath33 octet goldstone bosons off baryons of the @xmath34 nucleon octet in the charmless sector @xcite .",
    "unitarized coupled - channel methods have been further extended to the baryon - meson sector with charm degrees of freedom under several variants : the works in  @xcite use a bare baryon - meson interaction saturated with the @xmath35-channel exchange of vector mesons between pseudoscalar mesons and baryons .",
    "the works in @xcite are based on the jlich meson - exchange model .",
    "those in @xcite apply the hidden gauge formalism , and the same approach has been extended to the bottom sector in @xcite .",
    "finally , an extended weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) interaction is used in @xcite .    of special importance",
    "are the symmetries that are implemented in the quark or hadronic models .",
    "typically , while hadronic models pay an special attention to chiral symmetry , quark models usually implement heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) .",
    "hqss is a direct consequence of qcd  @xcite .",
    "it states that the interaction dependent on the spin state of the heavy quark is of @xmath36 , and so suppressed in the infinite quark mass limit .",
    "for instance , the vector and pseudoscalar mesons with a bottom quark , which only differ in how the spins of light and heavy quarks are coupled , form a doublet of hqss and would be degenerate in the infinite mass limit .",
    "so , hqss requires the pseudoscalar @xmath37 meson and the @xmath38 meson , its vector partner , to be treated on an equal footing . on the other hand ,",
    "chiral symmetry fixes the lowest order interaction between goldstone bosons and other hadrons in a model independent way ; this is the wt interaction .",
    "thus , it is appealing to have a predictive model for four flavors including all basic hadrons ( pseudoscalar and vector mesons , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 baryons ) which reduces to the wt interaction in the sector where goldstone bosons are involved and which incorporates hqss in the sector where bottom quarks participate .    in this letter",
    "we use hadronic degrees of freedom in a unitarized meson - baryon coupled - channel calculation .",
    "we rely on a tree - level contact interaction that embodies the approximate pattern of both chiral symmetry , when goldstone bosons are involved , and hqss when heavy hadrons are present .",
    "moreover , it enjoys spin - flavor symmetry in the light ( @xmath41 ) flavor sector .",
    "the scheme has been successfully used for describing odd parity @xmath42-wave light flavor  @xcite and charm  @xcite baryon resonances .",
    "indeed , the model naturally explains the overall features ( masses , widths and main couplings ) of the corresponding resonances ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) that appear in the charm sector ( @xmath45 )  @xcite .",
    "further predictions of this model for the @xmath46 sector can be found in @xcite .",
    "hqss is not explicitly accounted for in other unitarized coupled - channel models @xcite , as they typically give an asymmetric treatment to heavy mesons that are hqss partners .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed analysis of the hidden gauge model as applied in @xcite shows no actual violation in the heavy quark limit @xcite . ) or they would be suppressed in the heavy quark limit due to the presence of a heavy vector - meson exchange propagator ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) . ]    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the features of our coupled - channel unitarized approach while in sec .",
    "[ results ] we show the results not only for ( @xmath48 ) but also for ( @xmath49 ) states , which belong to the same su(3)@xmath50hqss multiplets .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we follow here the approach already applied in refs .",
    "@xcite for charm quarks .",
    "we will consider a system with baryon number one , one bottom quark ( @xmath51 ) and strangeness , isospin and spin - parity given by : @xmath52 denoted as @xmath10 , @xmath53 as @xmath54 , @xmath55 as @xmath11 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "all meson - baryon pairs with the same @xmath58 quantum numbers span the coupled - channel space .",
    "we apply @xmath42-wave amplitudes .",
    "this seems appropriate in our case since the observed resonances are close to threshold .",
    "the tree - level contact amplitudes between two channels @xmath59 for each @xmath58 sector are given by : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of the system ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 are , respectively , the c.m .",
    "energy and mass of the baryon in the channel @xmath64 ; and @xmath65 is the decay constant of the meson in the @xmath64-channel .",
    "the masses of baryons with bottom content used in this work are compiled in table  [ tab : baryonmass ] , while those of the bottom mesons and their decay constants are given in table  [ tab : mesonmass ] .",
    "the rest of hadron masses and meson decay constants not shown in the above tables have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally the coefficients @xmath66 come from the underlying spin - flavor extended wt structure of the couplings in our model @xcite .",
    "tables for the coefficients can be found in the appendices b of refs .",
    "the coefficients to be used for the @xmath51 sector ( one bottom quark interacting with light quarks ) are identical to those for @xmath45 ( one charm quark interacting with light quarks ) with obvious renaming of the heavy hadrons .",
    "the universality of the interactions of heavy quarks , regardless of their concrete ( large ) mass , flavor and spin state , follows from qcd @xcite and it is automatically implemented in our model .",
    "let us note that such emerging heavy spin - flavor symmetry , which becomes exact in the infinitely heavy quark limit , is different from the approximate su(6 ) or light spin - flavor symmetry , also implemented in our model .",
    "we remark that the various exact symmetries referred to above ( chiral , spin - flavor and hqss ) apply only to the coefficients @xmath66 , while physical masses and decay meson constants are used throughout when solving the coupled - channel equations .",
    "the symmetry content of our model can be exposed by artificially changing these hadron properties ( masses and decay constants ) to enforce spin - flavor , flavor and/or heavy quark spin symmetries .",
    "if , starting from the physical values , @xmath67 is adiabatically enforced , the resonances so obtained organize themselves into exact @xmath68 multiplets . in this way",
    "this approximate symmetry can be used to label the physical states . the largest exact symmetry present in the coefficients",
    "@xmath66 is @xmath69 , so the physical states can also be classified under approximate multiplets of this symmetry .",
    "still allows many possible interactions so spin - flavor su(8 ) is used to reduce the number of parameters , but this symmetry is explictly broken , even at the level of coefficients , in order to have exact hqss @xcite .",
    "] we apply such group label assignments to our results .",
    "we use the matrix @xmath70 as kernel to solve the bethe - salpeter equation , which provides the @xmath71-matrix as @xmath72 here @xmath73 is a diagonal matrix containing the two particle propagator for each channel . explicitly @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mass of the meson in the channel @xmath64 .",
    "the loop function @xmath76 can be found in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for the different relevant riemann sheets .",
    "the two particle propagator diverges logarithmically .",
    "the loop is renormalized by a subtraction constant such that @xmath77 to fix the subtraction point @xmath78 , we apply the following prescription : @xmath78 equals @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are , respectively , the masses of the meson and the baryon of the channel with the lowest threshold ( minimal value of @xmath82 ) among all the channels with the given values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 and any value of @xmath85 . therefore the subtraction point takes a common value for all sectors @xmath58 with equal @xmath86 .",
    "this renormalization scheme ( rs ) was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "successful results from this rs , but involving only the mesons and baryons of the pion and nucleon octets were already obtained in @xcite .",
    "this specific rs is just a prescription which previously has produced good results , but it can be refined when phenomenological information is available .",
    "we will study this possibility in the next section .",
    "the dynamically - generated baryon resonances can be obtained as poles of the scattering amplitudes in each of the @xmath58 sectors .",
    "we look at both the first and second riemann sheets of the variable @xmath61 .",
    "the poles of the scattering amplitude on the first riemann sheet that appear on the real axis below threshold are interpreted as bound states .",
    "the poles that are found on the second riemann sheet below the real axis and above threshold are identified with resonances .",
    "the mass and the width of the bound state / resonance can be found from the position of the pole on the complex energy plane .",
    "close to the pole , the @xmath71-matrix behaves as @xmath87 @xmath88 provides the mass ( @xmath89 ) and the width ( @xmath90 ) of the resonance , and @xmath91 ( modulus and phase ) is the coupling of the resonance to the channel @xmath92 .",
    ".baryon masses and widths used throughout this work .",

( [ eq : defalpha ] ) . there is no particularly good reason to use the same value as in the @xmath10 case .",
    "even su(3 ) does not relate the two @xmath78 points , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , required to fix the rs in each sector .",
    "if instead we take @xmath99 as in the @xmath10 sector , @xmath11 and @xmath57 binding energies ( masses ) will be larger ( smaller ) by about @xmath100 .",
    "these @xmath100 should be admitted as an intrinsic systematic uncertainty in our predictions in this sector .    in this way",

    "the three @xmath11 and one @xmath101 states have also partners in the charm sector .",
    "we find that states with the same group labels are the heavy flavor counterpart of each other , as already noted for the @xmath10 and @xmath102 sectors . by comparing table  [ tabxib ] with table v of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the hqss partners in the charm sector coming from the @xmath110 representation , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , are the bottom counterparts of the @xmath6 and @xmath113 states . moreover , the charmed @xmath114 and @xmath115 resonances are analogous to the @xmath104 and @xmath106 ones in the bottom sector , respectively . none of these bottomed states have been seen experimentally yet .",
    "schemes based on quark models @xcite predict @xmath116 and @xmath117 states with similar masses to our estimates , though there exist some differences between the various predictions .",
    "the experimental observation of the @xmath11 and @xmath57 excited states and their decays might , on the other hand , provide some valuable information concerning the nature of these states , whether they can be described as pure quark states or they have an important molecular component .",

    "we rely on a relatively simple tree - level contact interaction already used in the charm sector @xcite : the matrix elements follow from clebsch - gordan coefficients of the underlying spin - flavor symmetry with no free - parameters .",
    "this interaction has the virtue of embodying the approximate patterns of chiral symmetry , when goldstone bosons are involved , and hqss when heavy hadrons are present .    a summary of our predictions is graphically shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] .",

    "<S> the lhcb collaboration has recently observed two narrow baryon resonances with beauty . </S>",
    "<S> their masses and decay modes look consistent with the quark model orbitally excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the existence of these states within a unitarized meson - baryon coupled - channel dynamical model , which implements heavy - quark spin symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> masses , quantum numbers and couplings of these resonances to the different meson - baryon channels are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resonances @xmath4 and @xmath5 are heavy - quark spin symmetry partners , which naturally explains their approximate mass degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding bottom - strange baryon resonances are predicted at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two @xmath10 and two @xmath11 resonances complete a multiplet of the combined symmetry su(3)-flavor times heavy - quark spin . </S>"
