    "by definition , right - angled artin groups ( raags ) are groups that admit a presentation with a finite number of generators and with all relations commutator relations between pairs of generators .",
    "raags are often specified using a finite simplicial graph @xmath3 , called the defining graph , which determines the presentation .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite simplicial graph ( recall that a simplicial graph has no loops or bigons ) .",
    "then the raag @xmath4 is the group whose generators are the vertices of @xmath3 and whose relations are the commutator relations between pairs of adjacent vertices .",
    "droms @xcite showed that any two graphs that define isomorphic raags must be isomorphic as graphs ; thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of raags and isomorphism classes of finite simplicial graphs .",
    "if @xmath3 is a discrete graph on @xmath5 vertices , that is , @xmath3 has no edges , then none of the generators commute , so @xmath2 is a free group @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a complete graph on @xmath5 vertices , then all generators commute , so @xmath2 is a free abelian group @xmath6",
    ".    if @xmath3 is a join of @xmath7 subgraphs @xmath8 with vertex sets @xmath9 , then all vertices of @xmath10 commute with all vertices of @xmath11 ( for all @xmath12 ) , so @xmath13 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath3 is the graph shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] ,    .,width=288 ]    then @xmath14 , and if @xmath3 is a complete bipartite graph @xmath15 , then @xmath2 is the direct product of free groups @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a cyclic graph of length @xmath17 , then @xmath2 is not a direct product or free product of subgroups .",
    "more generally , this is the case for any @xmath3 that is connected and does not decompose as a join .",
    "we have seen that free groups and free abelian groups are extreme examples of raags- one corresponding to a graph with no edges and the other to a graph that includes all possible edges .",
    "clearly many raags lie between the two , since every isomorphism class of graphs defines a different raag .",
    "we think of raags as interpolating between free groups and free abelian groups .",
    "raags appear as subgroups of other well - known groups .",
    "for example , every raag embeds as a subgroup of some mapping class group .",
    "right - angled coxeter groups have presentations like those of raags , except that they include relations giving each generator order two .",
    "davis and januszkeiwicz @xcite showed that every raag embeds as a finite - index subgroup of some right - angled coxeter group . since coxeter groups are linear , so are raags ( linearity of raags was also shown by @xcite . )",
    "thus raags are residually finite , since they are linear and finitely generated .",
    "raags are also known to be residually torsion - free nilpotent @xcite ; as a consequence they are bi - orderable @xcite and torsion - free .",
    "raags are known to contain several different classes of groups as subgroups .",
    "for example , they contain all of the surface groups ( either orientable or not , either closed or with boundary ) , except for three ( @xcite , extending the work of @xcite ) .",
    "they also contain the graph braid groups @xcite .",
    "more recently , wise @xcite showed that any word - hyperbolic group with a quasiconvex hierarchy has a finite - index subgroup that embeds as a subgroup of a raag .",
    "this last result was instrumental in the proof of thurston s virtually fibered conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds , which says that every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finite cover that is a surface bundle over the circle .",
    "agol @xcite had shown that every right - angled coxeter group contains a finite index subgroup satisfying the technical property called residually finite rationally solvable ( rfrs ) @xcite ; in other words , right - angled coxeter groups are virtually rfrs .",
    "since the property of being virtually rfrs is inherited by subgroups , and since raags are subgroups of right - angled coxeter groups , any subgroup of a raag is virtually rfrs ; thus wise s result showed that any word - hyperbolic group with a quasiconvex hierarchy is virtually rfrs .",
    "agol @xcite also had shown that any irreducible 3-manifold with rfrs fundamental group is virtually fibered .",
    "wise used this result to show that all closed hyperbolic haken 3-manifolds are virtually fibered @xcite .",
    "finally agol , groves , and manning completed the proof that the virtually fibered conjecture holds for _ all _ closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds by showing that the virtually haken conjecture holds for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds @xcite .",
    "in wise s work , a central role is played by salvetti complexes . given a raag @xmath2 , its salvetti complex is constructed as follows .",
    "the 1-skeleton is a rose : it has one vertex and @xmath5 edges , each of length one , labeled by the generators @xmath18 of @xmath2 . for each commutator relation @xmath19 , a unit square 2-cell",
    "is attached along the @xmath20 and @xmath21 edges , forming a torus .",
    "for every three generators that pairwise commute , a 3-torus is formed by attaching a unit cube along the three 2-tori associated to the three generators .",
    "this process is continued , so that an @xmath5-torus is formed for every @xmath5 generators that pairwise commute .",
    "the resulting finite - dimensional cubed complex @xmath22 is the salvetti complex for @xmath2 .",
    "its universal cover @xmath23 is a cat(0 ) cubical complex , and the raag @xmath2 acts geometrically on @xmath23 .",
    "my thesis concerns more generally certain kinds of geometric actions of raags on cat(0 ) rectangle complexes .",
    "we pause to introduce some terminology for certain subgraphs associated with the vertices of a defining graph .",
    "let @xmath24 be a vertex of a defining graph .",
    "then the _ link _ , @xmath25 , of @xmath24 is the full subgraph spanned by the vertices adjacent to @xmath24 .",
    "the _ star _ , @xmath26 , of @xmath24 is the full subgraph spanned by @xmath24 and the vertices adjacent to @xmath24 .",
    "it is sometimes possible to prove that some property holds for a restricted set of raags , where the restriction is put on the defining graph .",
    "a useful idea has been that of a _ homogeneous _ graph .",
    "homogeneity is defined using induction .",
    "we say that a finite simplicial graph is _ homogeneous of dimension 1 _ if it is non - empty and discrete ( contains no edges ) .",
    "furthermore , we say that a finite simplicial graph is _ homogeneous of dimension @xmath27 _ if it is connected and if the link of every vertex is homogeneous of dimension @xmath28 .",
    "note that a graph @xmath29 is homogeneous of dimension 2 if and only if it is connected and triangle - free ; this condition implies that the salvetti complex @xmath30 is 2-dimensional .",
    "the outer automorphism groups of raags are objects of considerable interest .",
    "if the automorphism group of a raag @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath31 , and the subgroup formed by the conjugations by @xmath32 , then the outer automorphism group is the group @xmath33 .",
    "just as raags interpolate between free groups and free abelian groups , their outer automorphism groups interpolate between the outer automorphism group of a free group , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "several properties shared by both @xmath34 and @xmath35 have also been shown to hold for the outer automorphism group of an arbitrary raag .",
    "for example , charney and vogtmann showed in @xcite that for any raag @xmath2 , @xmath36 is virtually torsion - free and has finite virtual cohomological dimension , and they showed in @xcite that @xmath36 is residually finite ; this last result was also proved by different methods by minasyan @xcite . also charney and",
    "vogtmann showed in @xcite that for @xmath3 a homogeneous defining graph , @xmath36 satisfes the tits alternative : every subgroup of @xmath36 is either virtually solvable or contains a non - abelian free group .",
    "many results concerning @xmath34 were obtained through the study of outer space , a contractible space on which @xmath34 acts with finite point stabilizers .    outer space , which we denote by @xmath37 ,",
    "was introduced by culler and vogtmann @xcite .",
    "the points of @xmath37 are given by actions of @xmath0 on trees .",
    "the trees are simplicial @xmath38-trees , and can be described as trees that have been equipped with a length metric by assigning one of finitely many lengths to each edge .",
    "the actions are simplicial , free , minimal actions by isometries , where a minimal action is one under which there is no invariant subtree .    for each action",
    "@xmath39 , there is an associated translation length function @xmath40 .",
    "this is the function @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 ; the element @xmath43 is sent to the infimum of distances moved by points of @xmath44 under the action of @xmath45 .",
    "the assumptions ensure that the infimum is realized as a minimum .",
    "the function @xmath40 is constant on conjugacy classes .",
    "let @xmath46 be the set of conjugacy classes of @xmath0 and consider the map @xmath47 . note that @xmath46 is countable , since @xmath0 is countable .",
    "one considers @xmath40 to be an element of @xmath48 @xmath49 ; then up to scaling , we get an element of @xmath1 , called a projectivized length function .",
    "thus there is a map from the set of actions @xmath50 to the space @xmath1 , defined by sending each action to its corresponding projectivized translation length function .",
    "if we consider trees up to scaling of their metrics , then we get the map @xmath51    culler and morgan @xcite proved two important theorems concerning the relationship between actions on trees and their associated length functions .",
    "the first theorem shows that the length function of a minimal action of a free group on a tree completely determines the action .",
    "thus the map @xmath52 is an injection .",
    "in fact , culler and vogtmann give @xmath37 the topology it inherits as a subspace of @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that this subspace topology is the same as the equivariant gromov - hausdorff topology of a set of actions on metric spaces ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second theorem says that the image of this map lies within a compact subspace of @xmath1 and hence has compact closure in @xmath1 . in relation to outer space",
    ", the first theorem shows that outer space can be embedded in @xmath1 , while the second theorem gives a compactification of outer space .",
    "the points of @xmath37 are actions of @xmath0 on trees ; this is reasonable since free groups are the fundamental groups of graphs and thus act naturally on their universal covers , which are trees .",
    "homogeneous raags of dimension 2 are the fundamental groups of cell complexes formed by gluing together 2-dimensional tori .",
    "thus they act naturally on the universal covers of such complexes ; these universal covers are 2-dimensional cat(0 ) rectangle complexes .",
    "recently charney , stambaugh , and vogtmann have constructed analogues of outer space for raags .",
    "the points of these outer spaces are given by minimal actions on cat(0 ) rectangle complexes @xmath53 .",
    "we work in the setting of homogeneous raags @xmath2 of dimension 2 . in this case , the definition of a minimal action is more technical than that in the free group case .",
    "first of all , a minimal action must be simplicial , proper , semisimple , and by isometries , where an action @xmath50 is _ semisimple _ if @xmath54 is realized as a minimum .",
    "the _ minset _ of @xmath55 is @xmath56 , and the minset of a subgroup @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "finally , a _ minimal _",
    "action is a simplicial , proper , semisimple action by isometries that also has the property that @xmath53 is covered by minsets of @xmath59-subgroups .",
    "a theorem of charney and margolis @xcite , analogous to the first theorem of culler and morgan , says that the length function of a minimal action completely determines the action .",
    "thus , analogous to the free group case , @xmath60 is an injection and @xmath61 can be embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , a topology can be put on @xmath61 via this map .    to get a compactification of @xmath61 , one need",
    "only show that the image of this map has compact closure .",
    "our main theorem does exactly this ; it is an analogue of culler and morgan s second theorem .",
    "main let @xmath2 be a homogeneous raag of dimension 2 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the set of minimal actions of @xmath2 on 2-dimensional cat(0 ) rectangle complexes , up to scaling . under the map that sends an action to its projectivized translation length function",
    ", the image of @xmath61 lies in a compact subspace of @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of culler and morgan s second theorem depended on a key proposition .",
    "the analogue of that proposition is our proposition  [ key ] .",
    "define the cyclically reduced word length @xmath62 of an element @xmath55 to be the length of the shortest word in the generators of @xmath2 or their inverses that represents an element conjugate to @xmath45 .",
    "key let @xmath3 be a connected , triangle - free graph , and let @xmath2 be the associated raag .",
    "there exists a finite subset @xmath63 and a constant @xmath64 such that for any minimal action @xmath50 of @xmath2 on a 2-dimensional cat(0 ) rectangle complex , and for any @xmath55 , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , our theorem  [ main ] follows from proposition  [ key ] in essentially the same way that culler and morgan s theorem did .",
    "however , our proof of proposition  [ key ] differs completely from that of culler and morgan s .",
    "their proof was by induction on @xmath62 and used the following property satisfied by the length function of any isometric action @xmath50 of a group @xmath67 on a tree : for all @xmath68 , either @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "this property is not satisfied by our actions , so we were forced to take a different tack .",
    "our proof depends on the geometry of cat(0 ) rectangle complexes .",
    "in particular , it depends on understanding the relationship between translation lengths and distances between minsets .",
    "more specifically , it depends on being able , for a given action , to bound the distance between two minsets of generators by the translation length of a product of the generators .",
    "in fact , we work with @xmath71 distances ( based on lengths of edge paths ) and @xmath72 translation lengths , rather than cat(0 ) distances and cat(0 ) translation lengths , and develop rules for determining which edge paths can be used to measure @xmath72 translation lengths .",
    "the proof also depends on being able , for a given action , to find a base point whose distance from all minsets of generators is bounded by a function of the distances between the minsets .",
    "here we again work with @xmath71 distances and we make use of some cat(0 ) geometry , for example , the fact that each minset is isometric to a @xmath73 , a consequence of theorem ii.6.8(4 ) in @xcite .",
    "these geometric arguments form the core of the proof of proposition  [ key ] and thus of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "in this thesis , we work with cat(0 ) rectangle complexes . before introducing these ,",
    "we first review the definition of cat(0 ) spaces and give a few useful theorems concerning them .    given a metric space ,",
    "geodesic _ is an isometric embedding of a line segment ( or line ) into the space .",
    "since such a path has length the distance between the points , a geodesic is also a path of minimal length between its endpoints .",
    "geodesic metric space _ is a metric space for which any two points of the space are joined by a geodesic .",
    "note that a geodesic metric space is necessarily a _ length space _ : a metric space for which the distance between any two points is the infimum of the lengths of the paths that join them .",
    "now let @xmath53 be a geodesic metric space ; we will say what it means for @xmath53 to be cat(0 ) .",
    "first note that a triangle of @xmath53 is specified by three points along with three geodesics joining the three pairs of points . given any triangle in @xmath53 ,",
    "we can form a comparison triangle in euclidean 2-space whose side lengths are the same as those of the three geodesic segments of @xmath53 , and for each point of the triangle , there is a corresponding point of the comparison triangle , specified by its distance from the endpoints of the geodesic segment on which it lies .",
    "informally , @xmath53 is cat(0 ) if triangles in @xmath53 are at least as thin as their comparison triangles .",
    "formally , @xmath53 is cat(0 ) if for any two points of any triangle of @xmath53 , the distance between them is less than or equal to the distance ( in euclidean 2-space ) between the corresponding two points of the comparison triangle .    a space that is locally cat(0 ) is said to be non - positively curved .",
    "note that hyperbolic space and euclidean space are both cat(0 ) , and in fact any manifold of non - positive sectional curvature will be non - positively curved in the cat(0 ) sense .",
    "thus the cat(0 ) condition applies to a larger class of spaces ; still many results can be derived from the assumption of cat(0 ) .",
    "for example , cat(0 ) spaces are uniquely geodesic , that is , given any two points , there is a _",
    "unique _ geodesic segment joining them .",
    "we often denote the unique geodesic that joins two points @xmath74 and @xmath75 by @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , geodesics vary continuously with their endpoints . from this",
    "it follows that every open ball is contractible , and in fact that the cat(0 ) space itself is contractible .",
    "this property that cat(0 ) spaces are contractible is an important one .",
    "also , in a cat(0 ) space , every local geodesic is a ( global ) geodesic , and open balls are convex .",
    "( see bridson and haefliger @xcite for details . )",
    "we ve seen above that every cat(0 ) space is non - positively curved , is contractible , thus simply connected , and is a geodesic space , thus a length space . an important theorem is the following .",
    "( cartan - hadamard ; theorem ii.4.1 in @xcite ) any complete length space that is both non - positively curved and simply connected is ( globally ) cat(0 ) .",
    "this theorem is often called a ` local - to - global ' theorem , since it says that if a simply connected complete length space is locally cat(0 ) , then it is globally cat(0 ) .",
    "one theorem that we rely on ( albeit indirectly ) is the flat quadrilateral theorem @xcite . before stating the theorem",
    ", we give some necessary definitions .",
    "first , we define the alexandrov angle between two geodesics of a geodesic space @xmath53 .",
    "suppose @xmath77 \\rightarrow x$ ] and @xmath78 \\rightarrow x$ ] are geodesics with the same starting point @xmath79 .",
    "we define the angle ( at @xmath80 ) between @xmath81 and @xmath82 using the limits of angles in comparison triangles .",
    "specifically , if @xmath83 is the comparison triangle for the triangle with vertices @xmath80 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the angle of @xmath83 at the point corresponding to @xmath80 , then the angle between @xmath81 and @xmath82 is @xmath87 .",
    "second , two quick definitions : first , a subspace @xmath88 of a geodesic metric space is _ convex _ if for any two points of @xmath88 , any geodesic that connects them is contained in @xmath88 , and second , the _ convex hull _ of a subset @xmath89 of a geodesic space is the intersection of all convex subspaces that contain @xmath89 .",
    "we note for later use that a convex subspace of a cat(0 ) space is itself a cat(0 ) space .",
    "( flat quadrilateral theorem ; theorem ii.2.11 in @xcite ) consider four points @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 in a cat(0 ) space @xmath53 , along with the four geodesic segments @xmath94 , [ q , r ] , [ r , s]$ ] , and @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "if the angle between the segments at each corner is at least @xmath96 , then the convex hull of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is isometric to a euclidean rectangle .",
    "this thesis is concerned with isometric actions on certain kinds of cat(0 ) spaces .",
    "we now discuss isometric actions on an arbitrary cat(0 ) space .",
    "an action by a group @xmath67 on a metric space @xmath53 is a map @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the group of homeomorphisms of @xmath53 .",
    "the action is said to be _ isometric _ if the image lies in the group of isometries of @xmath53 .",
    "the action is said to be _ cocompact _ if there is a compact set @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",
    "finally , we say that the action is _ proper _ if each element @xmath101 has an open neighborhood @xmath102 for which the set @xmath103 is finite .",
    "note that an action of a group @xmath67 on a topological space @xmath53 is often said to be proper if for every compact subset @xmath99 of @xmath53 , the set @xmath104 is finite .",
    "the two definitions are equivalent if @xmath53 is a proper metric space ( that is , closed balls are compact ) and @xmath67 acts by isometries on @xmath53 ( see bridson and haefliger @xcite ) ; thus the two definitions are equivalent for the actions we consider .",
    "every isometric action @xmath50 of a group @xmath67 on a metric space @xmath53 has an associated _ translation length function _ @xmath40 .",
    "this is the function @xmath105 that sends an element @xmath106 to @xmath107 ; that is , it sends @xmath45 to the infimum of distances moved by points of @xmath53 under the action of @xmath45 .    for each action @xmath108 and each element @xmath106",
    ", we define the _ minset _ of @xmath45 by @xmath109 ; thus @xmath110 is the set of points of @xmath53 for which the distance moved under the action of @xmath45 attains its infimum .",

    "also , an element @xmath45 is said to be _ hyperbolic _ if it is semisimple and @xmath115 .",
    "an action @xmath116 is said to be _ semisimple _ if every @xmath113 is semisimple , and _ hyperbolic _ if every non - identity element @xmath113 is hyperbolic .",
    "we mention some properties of length functions and minsets that are important for this thesis ; these and others are discussed in bridson and haefliger @xcite . for an isometric action @xmath117 , for any @xmath68 , @xmath118 .",
    "thus the length function @xmath40 is constant on conjugacy classes of @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath119 . in particular , if @xmath120 commutes with @xmath45 , then @xmath121 ; for example , @xmath122 .    if @xmath53 is a cat(0 ) space , then for any @xmath113 , @xmath110 is convex . if @xmath45 is a hyperbolic isometry , then we know quite a lot about the geometry of @xmath110 . in fact ,",
    "@xmath123 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is a convex subspace of @xmath53 ( throughout this thesis we use @xmath126 to denote that two spaces are isometric ) .",
    "furthermore the action of @xmath45 on @xmath110 sends a point @xmath127 to the point @xmath128 . in other words , @xmath45 acts by the identity on the component @xmath125 and by translation by @xmath114 on the component @xmath129 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath110 is a union of axes of @xmath45 , where an axis of @xmath45 is a geodesic line on which @xmath45 acts by non - trivial translation .",
    "in fact , we can say more than this .",
    "the following theorem is important to this work .",

    "finally , the quotient of each @xmath5-flat @xmath135 by the action of @xmath136 is an @xmath5-torus .",
    "we will shortly return to this theorem to talk about some implications , but first we discuss cubical complexes and rectangle complexes .    a _ cubical complex _ is a cell complex @xmath53 where each @xmath5-cell @xmath137 is a unit euclidean cube with injective characteristic map @xmath138 , and if the images of two characteristic maps @xmath139 ,  @xmath140 intersect in the set @xmath141 , then @xmath142 ,  @xmath143 are faces of @xmath144 ,  @xmath145 , and @xmath146 is an isometry between these faces ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath53 is equipped with the length metric @xmath147 induced by the euclidean metric on each cell .",
    "that is , for any two points @xmath148 , @xmath149 is defined to be the infimum of the lengths of paths joining @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( where the length of a path is defined using the lengths of subpaths that are contained in single cells . )",
    "we think of cubical complexes as being constructed by gluing together unit euclidean cubes along their faces .",
    "note that cubical complexes and simplicial complexes both satisfy the same kinds of additional conditions on the basic cell complex construction .",
    "cubed complexes are defined similarly but with fewer constraints , so that every cubical complex is a cubed complex . by definition ,",
    "a _ cubed complex _ is a cell complex @xmath53 where each @xmath5-cell @xmath137 is a unit euclidean cube whose characteristic map restricts to an isometry on each face ( see @xcite ) ; the metric is the length metric induced by the euclidean metric on each cell .",
    "in contrast to cubical complexes , characteristic maps are not required to be injective and two cubes may intersect in more than one face .",
    "an example of a cubed complex that is not a cubical complex is the 2-dimensional torus , constructed as usual using one vertex , two edges , and a square .    in this thesis , the spaces we deal with are rectangle complexes .",
    "these are described in exactly the same way as cubical complexes , except that each cell is a _",
    "hyperrectangle _ : a finite product @xmath152 $ ] of intervals of possibly different lengths ; in particular a 2-cell is a euclidean rectangle .",
    "different hyperrectangles of the same dimension may have different edge lengths .",
    "however , in this thesis , each rectangle complex is assumed to have only finitely many isometry types of cells ( this property is denoted by saying the complex _ has finite shapes _ ) , so it has only finitely many different edge lengths .",
    "we think of rectangle complexes as being constructed by gluing together euclidean hyperrectangles along their faces .",
    "any rectangle complex with finite shapes is a complete geodesic metric space , by a theorem of bridson ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we say that a rectangle complex is _ homogeneous of dimension @xmath5 _ if every maximal hyperrectangle is @xmath5-dimensional .",
    "our main theorem concerns actions on rectangle complexes that are homogeneous of dimension 2 ; we think of such complexes as being constructed by gluing together euclidean ( 2-dimensional ) rectangles along their edges .",
    "the _ link _ @xmath153 of a vertex @xmath154 of a rectangle complex @xmath53 is the simplicial complex that contains one @xmath7-dimensional simplex for every @xmath155-dimensional hyperrectangle containing @xmath154 .",

    "this is a simplicial complex since it contains no loops or bigons , and it is flag since it contains no triangles .",

    "since the link of a point in a rectangle complex does not change if we rescale all edges to have length one , a version of theorem  [ npc ] holds for rectangle complexes as well : a rectangle complex with finite shapes has non - positive curvature if and only if the link of each vertex is a flag complex . in the case of a 2-dimensional rectangle complex ,",
    "the link of a vertex is a simplicial graph ; thus it is a flag complex if and only if it contains no triangles .    combining the rectangle complex version of theorem  [ npc ] with the cartan - hadamard theorem",
    ", we get the following .",
    "note that the assumptions of the cartan - hadamard theorem hold for a rectangle complex of finite shapes , since as noted above , such a complex is a complete geodesic space and thus a complete length space .",

    "we mention a few useful results here ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "an important concept is that of a wall .",

    "then ( 1 ) the union of hyperrectangles that contain a midplane of @xmath159 is a convex subcomplex of @xmath53 , ( 2 ) @xmath159 is convex and thus itself a cat(0 ) space ( in fact , it inherits the structure of a cat(0 ) rectangle complex ) , ( 3 ) @xmath160 has two connected components , and ( 4 ) every collection of pairwise intersecting hyperplanes has non - empty intersection .",
    "also , a geodesic that intersects @xmath159 in a segment of positive length must be completely contained in @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath159 is convex , this implies that any geodesic that does not lie entirely in @xmath159 crosses @xmath159 at most once .",
    "let @xmath161 be a raag that is homogeneous of dimension @xmath5 . in this thesis , we consider isometric , proper , semisimple actions by @xmath2 on @xmath5-dimensional cat(0 ) rectangle complexes @xmath53 .",

    "the assumption of minimality rids our space of extraneous points , that is , points unimportant for the structure of the action .    to get a better feel for this ,",

    "thus our definition of minimality says that an action is minimal if every point of @xmath53 lies in the axis of some @xmath55 .",
    "we now describe an example of an action that is not minimal .",
    "consider a tree @xmath53 , all of whose edges have length 1 , consisting of a real line plus added edges : in particular , a single edge , called a leaf , is attached to each vertex of the line .",
    "suppose the cyclic group @xmath168 acts on @xmath53 by translating the line by distance 1 .",
    "this action is isometric , proper , and semi - simple , but the leaves do not lie in the minset of any group element , so the action is not minimal .",
    "again , the idea is that the attached edges and leaves are inessential for the description of the action .",
    "note that the line forms an invariant subtree under the given action by @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , in the 1-dimensional case , our minimality condition is equivalent to requiring that under the action , @xmath53 has no invariant subtree .",
    "we return to the flat torus theorem .",
