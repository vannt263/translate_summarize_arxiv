    "the decomposition of the superconducting response into two bands allows the different contributions to the superfluid density to be examined ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bcs ] ) . the dirty - limit contribution ( @xmath157  @xmath44@xmath5 and @xmath132  @xmath5 ) falls very close to the calculated bcs dirty - limit scaling line , while the clean - limit contribution ( @xmath158  @xmath44@xmath5 and @xmath159  @xmath5 ) falls to the right ;",
    "this latter behavior is expected and has been previously discussed @xcite .",
    "initially , it was thought that the materials that fell on the scaling line were likely in the dirty limit @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that many superconducting materials fall on the scaling line , and many of them are not in the dirty limit @xcite . moreover",
    ", it has been recently demonstrated that the scaling relation is more robust than originally thought and should be valid for most materials , including those that approach the clean limit @xcite , suggesting that the scaling relation is an intrinsic property of the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "therefore , even though the contributions to the superfluid density in fete@xmath0se@xmath1 come from the clean as well as the dirty limit , the material should , and indeed does , fall on the universal scaling line .",
    "the detailed optical properties of the multiband superconductor fete@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath30  k ) have been examined for light polarized in the fe - te / se ( _ a - b _ ) planes for numerous temperatures above @xmath3 , as well as several below . in recognition of the multiband nature of this material ,",
    "the optical properties are described by the two - drude model . in the normal state",
    "the two - drude model yields a relatively weak drude response ( @xmath160  @xmath5 ) that is quite narrow at low temperature ( @xmath161  @xmath5 at 20  k ) but which grows quickly with increasing temperature , and a strong drude response ( @xmath162  @xmath5 ) with a large scattering rate ( @xmath163  @xmath5 ) that is essentially temperature independent .",
    "it is demonstrated that the generalized - drude model may not be used reliably in multiband materials , except in those cases where chemical substitution has effectively rendered the material either completely electron- or hole - doped . in the superconducting state for @xmath94",
    "the optical conductivity is reproduced quite well using the normal - state properties for @xmath164 and mattis - bardeen formalism with a small gap ( @xmath165  @xmath5 or about 2.8  mev ) applied to the strong drude component , and a large gap ( @xmath166  @xmath5 or about 5.6  mev ) applied to the narrow drude component . because the scattering rates on the two bands are quite different , this places one band in the dirty limit ( @xmath167 ) and the other close to the clean limit ( @xmath168 ) , effectively placing this material simultaneously in both the clean and dirty limit .",
    "the estimate for the superfluid density of @xmath169  @xmath5 using this model is quite close to the experimentally - determined value @xmath170  @xmath5 , which places this material on the universal scaling line for high - temperature superconductors in the region of the underdoped cuprates , similar to other iron - based superconductors .",
