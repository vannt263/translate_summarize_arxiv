    "the original intent of shels was to complete the redshift survey of the f1 field to r = 20.6 .",

    "in the discussion below we compare the properties of the two fields at the limiting r@xmath0 = 20.2 . to this limit",

    "the gama survey is somewhat shallower ( r @xmath2819.8 ) and has a target density about a factor of 2 smaller than shels , but it covers a much wider area , and is more complete ( liske et al .",

    "geller et al . ( 2014 ) describe the construction of the f2 catalog directly from the dls r - band photometry ( wittman et al .",
    "for this field we masked out regions around bright stars ( equation ( 1 ) in geller et al .",
    "2014 ) , thus reducing the effective survey area to 3.98 square degrees .    in the f1 field we began by selecting targets from the sdss dr9 ( ahn et al . 2012 ) in a region somewhat larger than the dls f1 footprint .",
    "the main galaxy candidates are extended sources based on the sdss point / extended source flag .",
    "we do not used the point sources in the analysis ; we use only the extended sources .",
    "we then use the available dls data to construct an r - limited galaxy catalog . for each sdss galaxy candidate with r@xmath29 , we searched for a dls counterpart within a 2@xmath7 tolerance . if there is a unique dls counterpart , we adopt the dls r - band magnitude .",
    "if there is no dls counterpart ( generally as a result of a nearby saturated star , a bleed trail , or proximity to the dls survey edges ) , we transform the magnitudes to the same system we use in f2 ( geller at al .",
    "we base the transformation on a fit to all of the galaxies we identify in both the dls f2 field and the sdss .",
    "we fit the dls f2 r - band magnitude ( r ) as a function of sdss @xmath30 and @xmath31 color to derive the transformation @xmath32 figure [ magcomp ] shows the residuals between the dls r - band magnitude and @xmath33 as a function of the sdss @xmath34 .",
    "the total number of objects with r@xmath16 that require this conversion is 710 or 9.8% of the sample to this limit .",
    "most of these objects are near the boundaris of the f1 redshift survey region and thus just outside the dls f1 footprint .",
    "there is also a small offset between the dls f2 magnitudes provided in their on - line database and the magnitudes reported in geller et al ( 2014 ) .",
    "we note that the f2 magnitudes reported in geller et al .",
    "( 2014 ) are total magnitudes calibrated to the vega system and extrapolated from the isophotal magnitude within the 28.7 mag arcsec@xmath20 isophote .",
    "the zero point offset between these magnitudes and those provided on the dls website is 0.038 magnitudes .",
    "we add this small offset to magnitudes for galaxies with f1 photometry in order to put the two fields on the same system for a direct comparison .",
    "for f1 we do not mask regions around bright stars ; the effective area covered by the survey is 4.2 square degrees .",
    "there may be some undersampling of the galaxy distribution around bright stars , but based on the area excised in f2 , a much deeper survey than the sdss , we expect the effect to be substantially less than 5% .",
    "in the f2 field approximately 3% of the galaxy candidates in our original catalog turned out to be stars . in the f1 field , a comparable 4% of the galaxy candidates selected from the sdss turned out to be stars .",
    "the smaller fraction of stars in f2 is qualitatively consistent with better seeing for the dls imaging .",
    "the dls photometry is much deeper than the sdss .",
    "furthermore the seeing in f2 was 0.90@xmath7 with a @xmath35% variation among subfields ; for f1 the average seeing was 0.98@xmath7 varying from 0.94@xmath7 to 1.01@xmath7 .",
    "for the sdss , the median seeing ( for dr7 ) was 1.43@xmath7 .",
    "thus the dls photometry may reveal low surface brightness objects and/or objects that are unresolved in the sdss .",
    "remarkably , the number of f2 galaxies with r@xmath16 missed in the sdss photometry is only 37 , corresponding to 0.4% of total number of f2 galaxies with r@xmath3620.2 .",
    "these objects are indeed either low surface brightness galaxies or they have very close neighbor galaxies unresolved by the sdss .",
    "we may be missing a comparable fraction of galaxies in f1 because we constructed the catalog directly from the sdss ; we conclude that the impact of differences in catalog construction on the numbers of objects is negligible at this limiting magnitude .",
    "we note that failure to include low surface brightness objects is a potentially important limitation for investigating some issues including the faint end of the luminosity function ( blanton et al .",
    "2005 ; geller et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "we used the 300-fiber hectospec instrument ( fabricant et al .",

    "this pipeline is a revision of the idl pipeline originally written by richard cool ( see http://www.mmto.org/book/export/html/55 ) .",
    "there is no difference between the redshifts derived from the two pipelines .    in the analysis of the f2 data , we used repeat hectospec observations of 1651 pairs of spectra of 1651 unique objects to compute internal errors in the redshift .",
    "we used the generally brighter ovelapping sdss galaxies to estimate an external error . for",
    "emission line objects the internal error ( normalized by ( 1 + z ) ) is 48 km s@xmath22 and for absorption line objects it is 24 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the typical external error , which may be underestimated from comparisons with brighter sdss objects , is 37 km s@xmath22 regardless of spectral type .",
    "there is a small offset between the sdss and mmt redshifts , @xmath37 = 3.4 @xmath38 3.9 km s@xmath22 .",
    "these errors also apply for f1 ; the instrument , the procedures , and the reduction are essentially identical .    as a result , in part , of variable conditions , the quality of spectra that yield acceptable redshifts varies significantly .",
    "the pipeline provides a standard measure of the quality of the spectrum , @xmath39 , a measure of the width of the cross - correlation peak originally defined by tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "based on the value of @xmath39 we compute the redshift error as in kurtz & mink ( 1998 ) .",

    "like f1 that span a significant redshift range @xmath39 is a better indicator of the quality of the redshift than signal - to - noise at a fixed wavelength .",
    "this figure is in the same format as figure 2 in geller et al .",

    "here we limit the figure to the highly complete r@xmath0 @xmath40 sample in f1 .",
    "although figure [ bfzxcr ] suggests that we could select reliable redshifts based merely on the value of @xmath39 , we inspect each spectrum visually after the pipeline processing .",

    "the f1 and f2 fields are currently unique in the completeness of the redshift surveys to the limiting apparent magnitude .",
    "it is thus interesting to compare the galaxy and cluster counts in the two fields as a measure of the potential impact of cosmic variance .",

    "most of these objects have a redshift , but among those without a redshift , a small fraction are stars . using the measured fraction of stars among the objects with spectroscopy in the two fields ( 3% were stars in f2 and 4% were stars in f1 ) we can reasonably convert the number of photometric objects to the number of probable galaxies brighter than the limit : 7244(f1 ) and 9481(f2 ) . in the f1 field we selected objects from the sdss and thus we did not remove regions around stars that were saturated in the dls photometry as we did for f2 .",
    "thus the effective area covered by f1 is larger .",
    "there may be some diminution in the counts in f1 as a result of this difference in procedure , but based on the observations , this difference should be @xmath84% , essentially the ratio of the effective areas in table [ numbers ] .",

    "this ratio assumes that the counts of these massive objects are unaffected by bright stars in f1 ( in other words we simply correct the relative counts by the small difference in the relative volumes of the two surveys ( 4.2 ( f1)/3.98 ( f2 ) ; table [ numbers ] ) and by the small difference in incompleteness ( 0.94 ( f1)/0.97 ( f2 ) ; table [ numbers ] ) ) .",
    "the count ratio is at best marginally consistent with the range we obtain from the full magnitude limited count .",
    "the relative counts of massive galaxies are probably a more robust reflection of any difference between the two fields than the raw counts . because the observing strategies are not identical , there are a number of subtle systematics that probably have a larger effect on the total count .",
    "these include failure to include low surface galaxies in f1 and failure to eliminate regions around bright stars .",
    "the magnitude transformation ( figure [ magcomp ] ) may also introduce systematics .",
    "we have checked the impact of the magnitude conversion by examining the central 3.57 deg@xmath9 of the f1 field where only 2.2% of the objects require a magnitude transformation ( as opposed to the 9.8% for the full field ) .",
    "the average number density of galaxies in this central field is only @xmath8 1% less than in the full field we analyze in detail .",
    "finally f2 contains a set of massive clusters at z@xmath8 0.53 ( note the peak in the redshift histogram of figure [ bnzf1f2 ] ) that also enhance the total count relative to f1 .",
    "in contrast , the count of massive galaxies concentrates on high surface brightness objects over the redshift range where both fields are well - sampled .",
    "we next compare the count ratios with the expected impact of cosmic variance on the relative counts in f1 and f2 .",
    "driver & robotham ( 2010 ) use sdss dr7 as a basis for developing a formula for computing the expected cosmic variance for a survey covering volumes @xmath89 10@xmath90 mpc@xmath68 ( for h@xmath0 = 70 km / s / mpc ) with arbitrary shape and depth ( their equation ( 4 ) ) .",

    "the formula given by driver & robotham ( 2010 ) provides the expected cosmic variance as a function of the median redshift transverse length and the median radial depth of the survey .",
    "the variance they compute for a 4 square degree field covering 0 @xmath93 with a 1:1 aspect ratio is 10% ( their table 2 ) . from their equation ( 4 )",
    "we derive an identical result for a 4 square degree region with the median redshift , 0.29 , that we measure for f2 limited to z = 0.5 . for a field like our 4.2 square degree field ( f1 ) with its slightly lower median redshift , 0.27 , for the sample limited to z = 0.5 ,",
    "the predicted cosmic variance is also 10% .",
    "driver & robotham ( 2010 ) show that the distribution of galaxy counts in cells lies between a gaussian and a log normal distribution .",
    "they use the gaussian approximation in their exploration of variance issues and we follow the same route . if we draw two independent samples randomly from a gaussian with dispersion @xmath11 , the mean of the absolute difference is ( 1.13@xmath38 0.85)@xmath11 .",
    "the result is based on 100,000 draws .",

    "the lower limit corresponds to the count of bright galaxies and the upper limit derives from the raw count ratios .",
