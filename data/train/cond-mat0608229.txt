    "silicon heterostructures form the basis of numerous semiconductor technologies . to understand future silicon heterostructure devices that involve quantum effects , one must consider the quantum states associated with the degenerate valleys in the conduction band structure . in a strained quantum well ,",
    "the valley degeneracy is two - fold .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by the singular nature of the quantum well interface , with characteristic energy splittings of order 0.1 - 1  mev for the case of sige / si / sige quantum wells.@xcite because this splitting is comparable in size to the zeeman splitting , the valley states can compete with spin states for prominence in quantum devices.@xcite for emerging technologies like silicon spintronics @xcite and quantum computing,@xcite it is therefore crucial to obtain a solid physical understanding of the valley physics , and to develop a predictive theory for the valley states .",
    "the technological significance of valley states was recognized long before the current interest in quantum devices.@xcite early studies focused on bulk silicon , particularly on the electronic states of shallow donors . in this case ,",
    "valley splitting was known to originate from the singular core of the donor potential , known as the ",
    "central cell.\"@xcite in one theoretical approach , the many - body interactions associated with the central cell were projected onto a single - electron , effective mass ( em ) framework , allowing the energy spectrum of the low - lying hydrogenic states to be computed from first principles.@xcite reasonable agreement with experiments was attained .",
    "however , because of the complicated projection procedure , a general purpose em theory was not obtained until more recently.@xcite    related techniques were applied to the problem of valley splitting in a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "there were several attempts to develop an em theory , which is well suited for treating inhomogeneous conditions , including conduction band offsets and non - uniform electric fields associated with modulation doping and top - gates .",
    "however , the resulting theories proved controversial , and many important valley splitting problems remain unsolved .",
    "atomistic approaches like tight - binding ( tb ) theory have recently emerged as important tools for calculating the valley splitting .",
    "@xcite these techniques have been applied to a range of heterostructure geometries,@xcite providing crucial insights and predictions for experiments that that may be difficult to implement .",
    "for example , the valley splitting has been predicted to oscillate as a function of the quantum well width.@xcite these oscillations can be reduced , or even eliminated , by applying an electric field .    here",
    ", we develop an em formalism , which corroborates the atomistic results quite accurately , and which provides a simple physical explanation for the intriguing oscillations .",
    "specifically , we show that the behavior occurs because of valley coupling interference between the top and bottom interfaces of the quantum well . in an electric field ,",
    "the wavefunction is squeezed to one side of the quantum well , thereby eliminating the interference effect .",
    "we also use the em theory to move beyond simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometries .",
    "for example , quantum wells grown on a miscut substrate represent an inherently 2d problem . here",
    ", we show that interference effects also play a crucial role for such miscut geometries , causing a strong suppression of the valley splitting at low magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : approaches ] , we review the two predominant approaches to valley coupling . in sec .",

    "[ sec:2deg ] , we consider the experimentally important problem of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : steps ] , we study the valley splitting in a magnetic field , when the quantum well is misaligned with respect to the crystallographic axes . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our results and conclude .",
    "earlier em approaches for the valley splitting in a heterostructure include the  electric breakthrough \" theory of ohkawa and uemura,@xcite and the surface scattering theory of sham and nakayama.@xcite a review of these theories and other related work is given in ref .",
    "the ohkawa - uemura formalism leads to a multi - valley em theory based on a two - band model involving the lowest two conduction bands at the @xmath2 point of the brillouin zone , @xmath3 and @xmath4.@xcite the resulting bulk dispersion relation has a local maximum at the @xmath2 point , and it exhibits two degenerate valleys , at roughly the correct positions in @xmath5-space .",
    "the sharp confinement potential at the heterostructure interface produces a natural coupling between the two @xmath6 valleys . for an infinite square well of width @xmath7 ,",
    "the ohkawa - uemura theory obtains a valley splitting of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the location of the valley minimum in the brillouin zone.@xcite this result was later confirmed by tb theory.@xcite the theory therefore captures the main qualitative aspects of the valley physics , with no additional input parameters besides those describing the bulk dispersion relation . in this sense , it is a first principles theory of valley splitting .",
    "however , some aspects of the ohkawa - uemura theory have been called into question .",
    "first , it has been criticized for its inaccurate description of the dispersion relation near the bottom of the valleys,@xcite leading to quantitative errors .",
    "more importantly , the method relies on a closed em description , which can not easily incorporate microscopic details of the quantum well barrier .",
    "this contradicts the fact that the valley coupling arises from physics occuring within several angstrms of the interface.@xcite such distances are much smaller than any em length scale , and can not be accurately described within any em theory .",
    "a physically appealing description of the heterostructure interface has been put forward by sham and nakayama .",
    "these authors develop a theory in which the reflection , transmission , and valley - scattering of waves at a si / si0@xmath10 interface is built directly into the bloch function basis states . since the confinement is incorporated into the basis set , it does not also appear as an external potential in the envelope equation .",
    "any additional potentials entering envelope equation ( _ e.g. _ , electrostatic potentials ) are therefore smooth , and easily accommodated in an em approach .",
    "the analytical results for the valley splitting are similar to ohkawa - uemura .",
    "indeed , the two approaches have been shown to be closely related.@xcite    the sham - nakayama theory has also been criticized .",
    "first , the theory is not self - contained  a single input parameter @xmath11 is introduced to characterize the microscopic width of the interface .",
    "although sham and nakayama provide an estimate for @xmath11 , the parameter is phenomenological .",
    "more importantly , the resulting em theory is somewhat cumbersome , and can not provide simple analytical solutions for the heterostructure geometries considered here .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an em theory which retains the desirable qualities of both the ohkawa - uemura and sham - nakayama approaches .",
    "we introduce a valley coupling parameter @xmath0 , which efficiently describes the valley coupling for any type of interface , and which enables simple analytical results for the valley splitting that are in agreement with atomistic theories .",

    "slowly \" is defined with respect to the crystalline unit cell of length @xmath13 : @xmath14 in practice , the em approach is extremely robust , often proving accurate well outside its range of validity .",
    "indeed , the standard textbook descriptions of shallow donors and quantum wells are both based on an em theory,@xcite despite the singular nature of their confinement potentials .    when the validity criterion ( [ eq : criterion ] ) is not satisfied , it is a good idea to compare the em results with microscopic or atomistic approaches , such as the tb theory of sec .",
    "[ sec : tb ] . for gaas",
    "quantum wells , the em theory provides quantitatively accurate results in most situations .",
    "the approach only breaks down for very narrow quantum wells , or for high subband indices.@xcite on the other hand , for indirect gap semiconductors like silicon , the em theory must be extended if valley splitting becomes an important issue .",
    "a singular confinement potential causes valley coupling , and calls for a more sophisticated treatment .",
    "here , we provide a discussion of both the general multi - valley em approach , and of the valley coupling , which arises from a sharp quantum barrier .    in the standard em theory ,",
    "the wavefunction for a conduction electron in bulk si can be written as a sum of contributions from the six degenerate valleys . however , the lattice mismatch between si and ge in a si@xmath15ge@xmath16/si / si@xmath15ge@xmath16 quantum well causes tensile strain in the si layer ( assuming strain - relaxed sige ) . as a result ,",
    "four of the six valleys rise in energy , while the two @xmath6 valleys fall in energy.@xcite the strain splitting is on the order of 200  mev for the composition corresponding to @xmath17.@xcite consequently , only @xmath6 valleys play a role in typical low - temperature experiments .",

    "we shall see that the envelope functions @xmath23 are the same for the two @xmath6 valleys .    a central feature of the em formalism , which is a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : criterion ] ) , is that wavefunction separates neatly into atomic scale oscillations ( the bloch functions ) and long wavelength modulations ( the envelope function ) .",

    "[ fig : envelope ] ) are commensurate with the crystal lattice , while the oscillations from @xmath26 are not , since @xmath27 is not at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "we can draw two main conclusions from the em / tb comparison .",

    "higher subbands ( not pictured in fig .  [",

    "second , the main difference between pairs of valley states does not occur in the envelope function , but in the fast oscillations .",
    "to leading order , the valley states are fully characterized by their valley composition vectors @xmath28 .",

[ ] , where shallow donors in silicon were considered .",
