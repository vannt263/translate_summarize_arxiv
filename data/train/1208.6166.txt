    "the notion of a transmutation operator relating two linear differential operators was introduced in 1938 by j. delsarte @xcite and nowadays represents a widely used tool in the theory of linear differential equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "very often in literature the transmutation operators are called the transformation operators . here",
    "we keep the original term introduced by delsarte and lions @xcite .",
    "it is well known that under certain regularity conditions the transmutation operator transmuting the operator @xmath7 into @xmath2 is a volterra integral operator with good properties . its integral kernel",
    "can be obtained as a solution of a certain goursat problem for the klein - gordon equation with a variable coefficient . there",
    "exist very few examples of the transmutation kernels available in a closed form ( see @xcite ) .    in the present work we obtain a representation for the kernels of the transmutation operators for regular sturm - liouville operators ( with complex valued coefficients ) in the form of a functional series with the exact formulae for the terms of the series .",
    "the result is based on several new observations .",
    "we use our recent result on the construction of the kernel of the transmutation operator corresponding to a darboux associated schrdinger operator @xcite to find out that a bicomplex - valued function whose one complex component is the transmutation kernel @xmath8 ( for a schrdinger operator @xmath9 , @xmath10 $ ] ) and the other complex component is @xmath11 ( for a schrdinger operator @xmath12 , with @xmath5 obtained from @xmath6 by a darboux transformation ) is a solution of a certain hyperbolic vekua equation of a special form ( for the theory of elliptic vekua equations see @xcite as well as @xcite and @xcite ) .    in spite of a recent progress reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the theory of hyperbolic vekua equations is considerably less developed than the theory of classical ( elliptic ) vekua equations .",
    "for example , as was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the construction of so - called formal powers ( solutions of the vekua equation generalizing the usual complex powers @xmath13 ) can be performed using the definitions  completely analogous to those introduced by l. bers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless no expansion theorem nor a result on the completeness of the obtained system ( a runge - type theorem ) of hyperbolic formal powers was available . in this work",
    "we apply the results from @xcite for constructing the formal powers for the hyperbolic vekua equation arising in relation with the kernels @xmath0 and @xmath14 as well as the observation from @xcite establishing that they are the result of the transmutation of the usual powers of the hyperbolic variable .",
    "we obtain an expansion theorem and prove a completeness result .",
    "moreover , we obtain explicit formulae for the expansion coefficients which leads to the functional series representation for the kernel @xmath0 ( and also for @xmath14 ) .",
    "we give several examples of application of this result including a numerical computation .",
    "finally , we propose an alternative method for approximate construction of the transmutation kernel based on the same hyperbolic formal powers but instead of the expansion theorem using the obtained completeness result and show that this method leads to an efficient method of solving of sturm - liouville spectral problems .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ secthpft ]",
    "we introduce the hyperbolic and bicomplex numbers , the vekua equation one of the solutions of which is the bicomplex function @xmath15 .",
    "we present several properties of that vekua equation , construct an infinite system of its solutions called formal powers , explain its relation to generalized wave polynomials and to spectral parameter power series ( spps ) representation for solutions of sturm - liouville equations .",
    "we consider a goursat problem for the hyperbolic cauchy - riemann system and obtain certain related results important for what follows . in section [ sectto ]",
    "we recall some long known facts about the transmutation operators and give some recent and new results concerning the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath14 , the commutation and the mapping properties of the corresponding transmutation operators . in section [ sectggto ]",
    "we introduce an operator transforming the boundary data of the goursat problem for the wave equation into the boundary data of the goursat problem for the operator @xmath16 . using its properties",
    "we obtain a result about a functional series representation for solutions of the equation @xmath17 in terms of generalized wave polynomials . in section [ secttransmutvekua ]",
    "we introduce a transmutation operator relating the hyperbolic cauchy - riemann operator with the interesting for us hyperbolic vekua operator .",
    "the main observation here is that this transmutation operator possessing important boundedness properties maps usual powers of the hyperbolic variable @xmath18 into the formal powers as well as the usual derivatives with respect to @xmath18 into the generalized derivatives in the sense of l. bers .",
    "here we mainly use the ideas from @xcite where similar observations were made in the elliptic setting .",
    "section [ secteth ] is dedicated to the expansion and the runge - type theorems corresponding to the special vekua equation under consideration .",
    "we show that a generalized taylor formula for its solutions is valid under certain conditions on their goursat data .",
    "the formula involves the formal powers constructed and studied in preceding sections .",
    "the obtained runge - type theorem establishes that even when the conditions required for the validity of the taylor expansion are not fulfilled any solution of the studied hyperbolic vekua equation can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a formal polynomial . in section [ sectkernelassolvekua ]",
    "we show that @xmath0 and @xmath14 are necessarily the conjugate components of a solution of the vekua equation . using this",
    "we give explicit formulae expressing @xmath14 in terms of @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "section [ sectfik ] contains the main result of this work  the representation of the transmutation kernel in terms of a generalized taylor series in formal powers . for the corresponding expansion coefficients we obtain both a recurrent and a direct exact formulae .",
    "several examples are given illustrating their application .",
    "in section [ sectapproxkernel ] we show how the obtained results can be used for numerical computation of the transmutation kernels . here together with the approach based on the generalized taylor expansion theorem we propose a method based on the runge - type theorem .",
    "when sufficiently many derivatives of the potential taken in the origin are not available this second method is more convenient .",
    "a developed numerical example illustrates its excellent computational performance .",
    "finally , in section [ sectasl ] we show that the developed theory can be applied to efficient numerical solution of sturm - liouville spectral problems and allows one to obtain thousands of eigenvalues whose errors are essentially of the same order .",
    "by @xmath19 we denote the hyperbolic imaginary unit : @xmath20 and consider the algebra of hyperbolic numbers , also called duplex numbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath21 the algebra @xmath22 is commutative and contains zero divisors .",

    "more on bicomplex numbers can be found , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the conjugate of a bicomplex number @xmath32 with respect to @xmath19 we denote by @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath37-valued functions will be also called scalar . for the scalar components of @xmath32 we introduce the notations @xmath38 in order not to overload the text by excessively many different notations we will use the notation @xmath39 and @xmath40 also in the operational sense as projection operators projecting @xmath41 onto the respective scalar components , @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the identity operator .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the pair of idempotents @xmath45 and @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 and @xmath48 . then for any @xmath41 there exist the unique numbers @xmath49 , @xmath50 such that @xmath51 which are related with the components of @xmath32 in the following way @xmath52 a nonzero element @xmath53belongs to the set of zero divisors @xmath54 iff @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "we will use the following norm ( see @xcite ) in @xmath29 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the usual norm in @xmath37 .",
    "we will consider functions @xmath59 and vekua - type equations of the form@xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are bicomplex functions of the variable @xmath63 . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite it was shown that many results from pseudoanalytic function theory @xcite remain valid in the hyperbolic situation .",
    "we will not give here definitions and properties corresponding to the general vekua equation ( [ vekua hyper ] ) referring the reader to @xcite .",
    "instead , as we are interested in a very special form of the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 we restrict ourselves to that particular case and obtain several results , such as the expansion theorem and a runge - type theorem which are still unavailable in a general situation . thus , let us consider the following hyperbolic vekua equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a scalar , non - vanishing function in the domain of interest .",
    "vekua equations of this form , i.e. , with @xmath66 and @xmath62 being a logarithmic derivative of a scalar function are called vekua equations of the main type or main vekua equations .",
    "they arise from the factorization of the stationary schrdinger operator ( in the elliptic case ) @xcite , @xcite and of the variable mass klein - gordon operator ( in the hyperbolic case ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the purposes of the present paper it is sufficient to consider the case when @xmath65 depends only on @xmath24 and hence ( [ vekua main hyper ] ) can be written also in the form @xmath67 it is equivalent to the system @xmath68@xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "admits a corresponding generating pair @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we recall that a generating pair corresponding to a vekua equation is a pair of its solutions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , independent in the sense that an arbitrary function @xmath81 , in this case @xmath29-valued , can be represented in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are scalar functions .",
    "that is , @xmath79 and @xmath80 should satisfy the condition @xmath85 everywhere in the domain of interest . in relation with the generating pair @xmath86",
    "observe that the scalar functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 satisfy ( [ hyp p analyt ] ) iff the @xmath29-valued function @xmath87 is a solution of ( [ vekua main hyper ] ) .",

    "is important to observe that if @xmath90 is a solution of ( [ vekua main x ] ) , its @xmath105-th derivative in the sense of bers ( if exists ) has an especially simple form @xmath109}=\\mathbf{j}^{n}{\\partial_{t}^{n}w . }",
