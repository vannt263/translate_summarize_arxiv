    "the discovery of the btz black holes contributed to studies that are conducted in different aspects of physics . among them",
    "one can point out : providing simplified machinery for studying different properties of black holes such as thermodynamical ones btzthermo1,btzthermo2,btzthermo3,btzthermo4,btzthermo5,btzthermo6,btzthermo7 , contributing to our understanding of gravitational systems and their interactions in lower dimensions @xcite , existence of specific relations between btz black holes and effective action in string theory btzstring1,btzstring2,btzstring3,btzstring4 and possible existence of gravitational aharonov - bohm effect due to the noncommutative btz black holes @xcite .",
    "in addition , several studies were conducted in context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , quantum aspect of three dimensional gravity , entanglement , quantum entropy btzent1,btzent2,btzent3,btzent4,btzent5,btzent6,btzent7 and holographic aspects of such solutions @xcite . furthermore , three dimensional black holes and their thermodynamical properties in the presence of different matter fields with various gravity models are addressed in literature @xcite .",

    "einstein theory of gravity introduces gravitons as massless particles with two degrees of freedom , whereas there are several arguments that state gravitons should be massive particles . in order to have massive graviton , theory of general relativity",
    "should be modified to include mass terms as well .",
    "the first attempt for constructing a massive theory was referred to the works of fierz and pauli @xcite .",
    "this theory was built in a flat background and its generalization to curved background leads to the existence of a typical ghost ( boulware - deser ghost ) @xcite .",
    "presence of the ghost indicates that the theory under consideration is unstable . in order to avoid such instability ,",

    "one of the ghost - free massive theories was introduced in a pioneering work by bergshoeff , hohm and townsend .",
    "this theory is a three dimensional massive theory and is known as new massive gravity ( nmg ) @xcite .",
    "the construction of nmg was done based on two important facts : first , a massless graviton has no propagating degrees of freedom in three dimensions .",
    "this leads to a symmetric tensor in three dimensions with six components with a diffeomorphism symmetry . due to this diffeomorphism symmetry , three degrees of freedom are pure gauge and the other three ones are non - dynamical .",
    "second , a massive graviton in three dimensions has two degrees of freedom similar to a massless graviton in four dimensions .",
    "therefore , it is possible to build a diffeomorphism invariant theory of massive gravity in which only the massive degree of freedom is present .",
    "black hole solutions in presence of this massive gravity theory have been obtained in literature newblack1,newblack2,newblack3,newblack4,newblack5,newblack6,newblack7 .",

    "maxwell theory of electrodynamics has been employed to study electrically charged systems in various branches of physics .",
    "although maxwell theory is a relatively successful theory in describing different phenomena , it is not flawless .",
    "one of the main problems of this theory is existence of singularity for electromagnetic field of point - like charges at their locations .",
    "in other words , the electric field of a point - like charge diverges at the charge location which leads to an infinite self - energy .",
    "in 1934 , born and infeld ( bi ) @xcite introduced a nonlinear electromagnetic field theory to solve infinite self - energy problem by imposing a maximum strength of the electromagnetic field .",
    "one year later , this nonlinear theory was first employed by hoffmann in context of einstein gravity @xcite .",

    "the divergencies of thermodynamical ricci scalar may coincide to bound or phase transition points .",
    "so far , four different geometrical methods were introduced ; weinhold @xcite , ruppeiner @xcite , quevedo @xcite and hpem @xcite .",

    "thermodynamical concepts indicate that studying a thermodynamical system should lead to same results irrespective of employed ensemble .",

    "in this section , we regard linearly charged three dimensional solutions in the context of massive gravity and investigate their geometric and thermodynamic properties .      here ,",

    "in addition , due to our interest in electrically charged black holes in massive gravity context , we consider a radial electric field which its related gauge potential is @xmath30    using the metric ( eq . ( [ metric ] ) ) with the maxwell field equation ( eq .",

    "it is easy to show that by using thermodynamic quantities such as electric charge ( [ totalq ] ) , entropy ( [ totals ] ) and mass ( [ totalm ] ) , with the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xmath64 one can define the intensive parameters conjugate to @xmath65 and @xmath56 .",
    "these quantities are the temperature and the electric potential @xmath66 which are the same as those calculated for temperature ( [ totaltt ] ) and electric potential ( [ totalu ] ) . in other word , although massive term modifies some of thermodynamic quantities , the first law of thermodynamics is still valid .      here , we study thermal stability criteria and the effects of different parameters on such criteria .",
    "the stability conditions in canonical ensemble are based on the sign of the heat capacity .",
    "this change of sign could happen whether when heat capacity meets root(s ) or divergency(ies ) .",
    "the root of heat capacity ( or temperature ) indicates a bound point , which separates physical solutions ( positive temperature ) from non - physical ones ( negative temperature ) . whereas the roots of denominator of heat capacity ( heat capacity divergencies ) represent phase transition points .",
    "the negativity of heat capacity represents unstable solutions which may undergo a phase transition and acquire stable state . in order to get a better picture and enrich the results of our study , we investigate both temperature and heat capacity , simultaneously .",

    "( [ totaltt ] ) and ( [ totals ] ) , it is a matter of calculation to show that @xmath68    obtained temperature ( [ totaltt ] ) consists three terms : cosmological constant , electric charge and massive parameter .",
    "the electric charge term is negative , therefore , its contribution is related to negativity of the temperature .",
    "the contribution of the massive term depends on the sign of @xmath69 .",
    "this term is not coupled with any order of horizon radius , which results in it being constant . for ads",
    "spacetime , @xmath70term is positive and its contribution is toward positivity of temperature , the vise versa is observed for ds spacetime . in conclusion , the ds black holes with negative @xmath69 has negative temperature every where , which results into absence of physical black hole solutions for this case .",
    "otherwise , the existence of physical black holes ( having positive temperature ) is restricted to satisfying a condition for massive term . for small values of horizon radius ,",
    "the dominant term is @xmath71term while for large values of it , the dominant term will be @xmath70term .",
    "therefore , for ds black holes , for small and large values of the horizon radius , the temperature is negative and the positive temperature may exist where massive term is dominant ( for positive @xmath69 ) . on the contrary , for ads black holes , for small values of horizon radius temperature",
    "is negative while for sufficiently large values of horizon radius , it is positive ( regardless of massive term ) .",
    "now , we are in a position to study bound and phase transition points of these black holes . solving denominator and numerator of the heat capacity with respect to horizon radius",
    "leads to following solutions for phase transition and bound points , respectively , @xmath72 @xmath73    interestingly , only for ds black holes phase transition exists and this phase transition is independent of massive term .",
    "in other words , the existence of second order phase transition is only a function of electric charge and cosmological constant . on the contrary ,",
    "the bound point is observed for both ds and ads solutions .",
    "this bound point is a function of the massive parameter , @xmath74 and electric charge .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that for the absence of massive gravity ( @xmath43 ) , only for ads spacetime , bound point exists ( no real bound point for ds black holes with @xmath75 ) .",
    "this is the contribution of the massive gravity into thermodynamical structure of the charged massive btz black holes . for ads black holes ,",
    "only one bound point is observed , whereas , for ds black holes , two bound points could be obtained .",
    "then again , we point out that existence of two bound points for ds black holes is due to contribution of the massive gravity .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in obtained heat capacity , massive term is coupled with horizon radius . to finalize the study in this section , we present various diagrams for temperature and heat capacity in case of variation of different parameters for ads and ds spacetimes ( see figs .",

    "smaller bound point is an increasing function of the cosmological constat and electric charge whereas , the larger bound point is a decreasing function of them ( see middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2ds ] ) . for physical solutions , there is a phase transition of larger to smaller black holes . in other words , even in physical region , only for specific range of horizon radius thermally stable solutions exist .",
    "once more , we emphasize that existence of stable physical solutions for ds spacetime is only due to contribution of the massive gravity .",
    "this subsection is devoted to the absence of the electric charge , since one of the most interesting effects of the massive gravity and its interesting phenomenology could be better observed in this case . considering the case of the absence of electric charge ( @xmath79 ) and taking a look at the obtained temperature and heat capacity , one can find @xmath80@xmath81    the mentioned quantities confirm that both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are positive for @xmath84 ( ads solutions ) while in order to have physical ds solutions ( @xmath85 ) with positive temperature , one should set @xmath86 .",
    "this limitation on @xmath54 leads to obtain negative @xmath83 , and therefore , we can not obtain physically stable ds black hole . hereafter in this subsection , we consider ads solutions for more discussions regarding vanishing event horizon .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ tq0 ] ) , one can find that for the limit @xmath87 , temperature of the black holes will not vanish .",
    "in other words , for vanishing the horizon radius of the black holes , the @xmath88term of temperature vanishes , whereas the massive term does not vanish .",
    "interestingly , the same behavior could be observed for heat capacity as well . on the contrary , for @xmath89 ,",
    "total mass and entropy of black holes will vanish .",
    "regarding black holes evaporation , we know that the mass and horizon radius decrease during the evaporation process .",
    "one may regard the case @xmath89 as final state of black holes evaporation .",
    "the non - zero value of the temperature for evaporation indicates that black holes leave a trace of their existences even after complete evaporation .",
    "therefore , all the information , regarding the existence of black holes , is not actually lost in evaporation .",
    "in fact , there is a contribution to temperature of the background spacetime in place of the formation of black holes .",
    "the trace of the existence of the black holes may be detected by this contribution to temperature of the background spacetime .",
    "in other words , by measuring the fluctuation of the temperature , one can determine formation and evaporation of a black hole ( a factor of @xmath90 should be observed ) .",
    "on the other hand , considering that thermodynamical temperature of the black holes has geometrical interpretation as well .",
    "the non - zero temperature after evaporation , indicates that information regarding the existence of the black holes is stored and encoded in geometrical structure of the spacetime .",
    "meaning that , formation and existence of black holes altered spacetime structure in a way that information regarding its existence is preserved .",
    "this information ( alteration in curvature and geometrical structure of the spacetime ) presents itself as a variation of the temperature in specific place .",
    "therefore , this variation of the temperature has no external source .",
    "its source is in the structure of spacetime itself .",

( [ p ] ) , one can find following relations by solving the denominator of these heat capacities with respect to pressure , @xmath129    since electric charge and bi parameter are positive quantities , the obtained relations indicate that no positive maximum for pressure exists for maxwell and bi cases . therefore , even by considering the generalization of the massive gravity , van der waals like behavior does not exists for charged three dimensional massive black holes in presence of cosmological constant .",
    "this result is expected . by taking a closer look at the heat capacity",
    ", one can see that denominator of the heat capacity is independent of the massive gravity .",
    "this independency results into absence of the van der waals like behavior ( previously , it was shown that btz black holes suffer the absence of van der waals like behavior in their phase diagrams ) .",
    "a question may rise regarding consideration of the positive cosmological constant proportional to thermodynamical pressure .",
    "calculations for this case will lead to following equations for pressure @xmath130    the obtained relations for pressure confirm that there is no maximum for pressure in this case .",

    "here , we regard the geometrical approach toward studying thermodynamical structure of the solutions . in this approach , thermodynamical phase space of a black hole is constructed by employing one of the thermodynamical quantities as potential .",
    "other extensive thermodynamical quantities are components of the phase space . the thermodynamical information of the system is encoded within ricci scalar of this thermodynamical metric .",
    "the bound points and phase transitions that were obtained in studying heat capacity , are matched with divergencies of thermodynamical ricci scalar of the constructed phase space .",
    "in other words , divergencies of the ricci scalar are points in which system acquire bound points or meet phase transitions .",
    "since , this is another method for studying thermodynamical behavior of the system , the results of it must be consistent with those obtained through other methods .",

    "therefore , we use numerical evaluation and present results in some diagrams ( see figs . [ fig5]-[fig7 ] ) .",
    "it is evident that divergencies of the ricci scalar of weinhold ( left panels of figs [ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] ) and ruppeiner ( right panels of figs fig5 and [ fig7 ] ) are not matched completely with bound and phase transition points .",
    "this result indicates that using these thermodynamical metrics also leads to ensemble dependency . on the contrary",
    ", the hpem metric provides divergencies in its ricci scalar which are coincidence with bound and phase transition points ( see figs [ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] ) . in other words , no extra divergency and mismatched are observed .",
    "therefore , using this method results into a uniform picture regarding bound points and phase transitions .",
    "in other words , no ensemble dependency exists for this method .",
    "in this paper , we have considered ( non)linearly charged btz black holes in the massive gravity context . after investigating geometrical properties ,",
    "thermodynamical structure of the solutions has been investigated through various methods .",
    "it was shown that thermodynamical structure of the solutions is highly sensitive to consideration of the ads or ds spacetime .",
    "the number of bound points and phase transitions was a function of cosmological constant and was sensitive to the sign of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , it was shown that due to contribution of the massive gravity , number of the bound points was modified while the divergencies ( phase transition ) of the heat capacity was independence of the massive gravity .",
    "one of the most important results of this paper was existence of non - zero temperature for vanishing horizon radius ( final state of black holes after evaporation ) .",
    "in other words , in case of neutral black holes , for black holes evaporation , the temperature and heat capacity were non - zero , indicating that after black holes evaporation , all information of the black holes is not lost .",
    "a trace of existence of black holes is left in terms of a fluctuation of the temperature .",
    "such property was not observed for linearly charged black holes , whereas , interestingly , generalization to nonlinear electromagnetic field recovered this property .",
    "it means that after evaporation of the nonlinearly charged btz - massive black holes , the trace of their existence will remain ( non - zero temperature ) .",
