    "a central aspect of the history of the universe is the formation and evolution of galaxies , and in particular their gradual build - up of metallicity ( pei & fall 1995 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; pettini 2006 ; sommer - larsen & fynbo 2008 ) . while the study of galaxies in the early universe has seen great progress through the identification of large samples of @xmath16 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) and other emission - selected galaxies ( e.g. , steidel et al .  1996 , 2004 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2009 ) , the study of the metals at the same cosmic epoch has seen equally large progress but mostly based on the study of @xmath17 dlas in the sightlines towards bright quasars ( e.g. , wolfe et al .",
    "2005 ; pontzen & pettini 2009 ) .",
    "thanks to the sdss the sample of high - redshift dlas is now larger than 1000 ( prochaska et al .  2005 ;",
    "noterdaeme et al .  2009 ) .",
    "in order to be able to form a complete picture of galaxy evolution one must find a way to combine the information inferred from high - redshift galaxies studied in emission and absorption , and it is a perplexing fact that there is almost no _ observational _ overlap between the two samples ( e.g. , fynbo et al .  1999 ; mller et al .  2002 ) .",
    "it is not obvious how one may combine the two samples because they have very different selection biases .",
    "lbg samples are all flux - limited , and therefore they carry information only about objects at the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "dlas are selected based on the probability that a random sightline passes through it , and they are therefore selected with a weight proportional to the absorption cross - section ( area ) they span on the sky .",
    "this area is known , locally , to scale with the luminosity to a given power ( the so - called holmberg and bosma relations ; wolfe et al .",
    "1986 and references therein ; see also zwaan et al .",
    "2005 ) . on the reasonable assumption that similar relations were in place at @xmath18 , and combining this with the slope of the faint end of the uv luminosity function , one finds that most dlas are selected from the faint end of the luminosity function ( fynbo et al .  1999 , 2008 ;",
    "haehnelt et al .",
    "2000 ; schaye 2001 ; pontzen et al .",
    "hence , the plausible connection between dlas and lbgs is that they are drawn from the same overall population of high-@xmath19 galaxies but that in the mean they are picked from two opposite ends of the high-@xmath19 galaxy uv luminosity function .    to better establish the validity of this picture , more detections of dlas in emission",
    "are required .",
    "detection of emission from dlas has been vigorously pursued for more than 20 years ( e.g. , smith et al.1989 ) , but with limited success . since 1993",
    "only two bona - fide high - redshift dla galaxies have been detected in emission ( mller et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; heinmller et al .",
    "in addition , counterparts of either @xmath20 dlas or sub - dlas have been published ( mller & warren 1993 , 1998 ; warren & mller 1996 ; djorgovski et al . 1996 ; leibundgut & robertson 1999 ; fynbo et al.1999 ; adelberger et al .",
    "at least ten times more systems have been searched for in emission with no detection ( e.g. , charlot & fall 1991 and references therein ; lowenthal et al .",
    "1995 ; colbert & malkan 2002 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "in addition to published non - detections many non - detections have not been published , e.g. , non - detections in the survey conducted with fors1 at the vlt 19992000 ( pi mller ) , and the flames / ifu survey also conducted at the vlt 20032005 ( pis leibundgut and zwaan ) ) .",
    "more recently , tentative detections based on integral - field unit spectrographs have been reported ( christensen et al .",
    "2007 ) and one of these has been confirmed with long - slit spectroscopy ( christensen , private communication ) .",
    "the low success rate has been thought to be the result of attenuation of ly@xmath0 photons by dust grains ( charlot & fall 1991 ) , but as discussed above it is also plausibly explained in terms of the prediction that dla galaxies must in the mean be drawn from the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "mller et al .  ( 2004 ) and ledoux et al .  (",
    "2006 ) provide evidence that dla galaxies obey luminosity - metallicity and velocity - metallicity relations with similar slopes as in the local universe .",
    "moreover , the dla galaxies that have been detected in emission ( both ly@xmath0 , broad band , and for those with redshifts in a range allowing observations in nir atmospheric windows , also in [ oiii ] emission ) are amongst the most metal - rich dlas ( mller et al .  2004 ; weatherley et al .",
    "fynbo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) describe a model that reconciles the known properties of dlas , lbgs and also gamma - ray burst host galaxies based on scaling relations known from the local universe ( luminosity function , holmberg / bosma relation , luminosity - metallicity relation and metallicity gradients ) .",
    "there is no doubt that reality is more complex than this simple picture ( see , e.g. , zwaan et al .",
    "2008 and tescari et al .",
    "2009 for a discussion of the likely importance of galactic winds for the kinematical properties of dlas ) .",
    "nevertheless , the basic ingredients in this picture have been found also in hydrodynamical simulations of dlas at @xmath21 ( pontzen et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to test this picture ,",
    "we have embarked on a survey targeting high - metallicity dlas in order to search for the galaxy counterparts .",
    "the project is carried out using our guaranteed time on the newly commissioned x - shooter spectrograph on the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) on cerro paranal in chile .",
    "x - shooter is an echelle spectrograph with three arms covering the full spectral range from the atmospheric cut - off around 2950 to the k - band . from the sdss dla sample of noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we have selected dlas with a rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the siii @xmath22 line larger than 1  .",
    "this is a good indication that the metallicity is high , i.e. likely larger than 0.1 solar ( e.g. , prochaska et al .",
    "2008 , their figure 6 ; kaplan et al .",
    "2010 ) . among these dlas , we selected the subsample with well - detected feii@xmath112344 , @xmath112374 , and @xmath112382 lines . for local starburst galaxies ,",
    "the strength of the ly@xmath0 emission line is controlled by a complex interplay between geometry , kinematical properties of the gas and dust content ( see , e.g. , atek et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "for this reason , we only include dlas with redshifts close to 2.4 which places the h@xmath1 , [ oii ] , [ oiii ] and/or h@xmath0 emission lines from the intervening dla in the nir transmission windows . at these redshifts ,",
    "the spectral range covered by x - shooter extends from the lyman - limit to h@xmath0 and we are not relying on ly@xmath0 alone for detecting the galaxy counterpart . in this paper , we report on the first target observed in the program , namely sdss j222256.11@xmath4094636.2 ( q2222@xmath40946 in the following ) , which has an intervening dla at a redshift of @xmath2 ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ) .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and a hubble constant of @xmath25 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "q2222@xmath40946 was observed on october 21 2009 with x - shooter .",
    "our strategy was to observe the qso at the position angles ( pas ) 60@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and 0@xmath26 ( all east of north ) , 1 hr each , using a 1.3 arcsec slit in the uvb arm and 1.2 arcsec slits in the vis and nir arms .",
    "the resulting resolving powers are 4700 ( uvb ) , 6700 ( vis ) , and 4400 ( nir ) respectively ( as measured from sky lines in the spectra ) . with this strategy",
    ", we cover the field of view close to the qso and will be able to determine the impact parameter and position angle of galaxy counterparts using triangulation ( see mller et al .",
    "2004 for an example of such a triangulation ) .",
    "based on the model by fynbo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) mentioned above , we predict that less than 10% of the galaxy counterparts will fall outside all three slits ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : strategy ] ) . with a full - drawn rectangle ,",
    "we illustrate the field covered by the x - shooter ifu . with a single ifu pointing centred on the qso",
    ", 30% of the dla - galaxy centres will be lost .",
    "we prefer to use long slits as this strategy provides superior data for the qso itself and the data analysis is more robust .    due to an error in the execution of our observing blocks at the telescope ,",
    "the object was observed twice at pa@xmath28 and once at pa@xmath29 .",
    "hence , we did not get a spectrum at pa@xmath30 .",
    "the observing conditions were variable with a seeing degrading from 0.8 to 1.6 arcsec ( as measured in the b - band ) .",
    "the airmass ranged from 1.0 to 1.2 and there were no clouds .",
    "we processed the spectra using a preliminary version of the x - shooter data reduction pipeline ( goldoni et al .",
    "the pipeline performs the following actions .",
    "first , the raw frames are corrected for the bias level ( uvb and vis ) and dark current ( nir ) .",
    "then , after background subtraction , cosmic ray hits are detected and corrected using the method developed by van dokkum ( 2001 ) and sky emission lines are subtracted using the kelson ( 2003 ) method .",
    "after division by the flat field , the orders are extracted and rectified in wavelength space using a wavelength solution previously obtained from calibration frames .",
    "the orders are then merged and in the overlapping regions the merging is weighted by the errors which are being propagated in the process . from the resulting 2d merged spectrum , a one - dimensional spectrum is extracted at the source s position . the one - dimensional spectrum with the corresponding error file and bad - pixel map is the final product of the reduction . intermediate products such as the sky spectrum and individual echelle orders ( with errors and bad - pixel maps ) are also produced .    to perform flux calibration , we extracted with the same procedures a spectrum of the flux standard bd + 17@xmath31 4708 ( bohlin & gilliland 2004 ) .",
    "this spectrum was divided by the flux table of the same star from the calspec hst database ( bohlin 2007 ) to produce the response function . the response was then interpolated where needed in the atmospheric absorption bands in the vis and nir spectra and applied to the spectrum of the source .",
    "no telluric correction was applied .",
    "we compare our flux calibration to the flux calibrated spectrum from the sloan survey ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2009 ) and find that our calibration gives 30% larger fluxes compared to the sloan calibration , but the shapes of the two spectra match very well .",

    "to search for rest - frame optical emission lines , we carried out spectral point spread function ( spsf ) subtraction of the qso light ( see mller 2000 ) .",

    "we calculate the average spsf .",
    "we then subtract the spsf over the spectral region covering the emission line by assuming that the qso spectrum can be fitted by a linear function across the position of the emission line .",

    "the ratio between the [ oiii ] and h@xmath0 luminosities is 1.2 , in good agreement with the estimate of weatherley et al .",

    "the ratio between the ly@xmath0 and h@xmath0 luminosities is 4.0 whilst a ratio of about 8.7 is expected from case - b recombination .",
    "this suggests that about 55% of the ly@xmath0 photons are either destroyed by dust or that most of the ly@xmath0 emission is emitted in other directions due to radiative transfer effects . in general ,",
    "scattering effects cause a quite anisotropic escape of ly@xmath0 ; laursen et al .",
    "( 2009b ) find that ly@xmath0 emitters on average will be 24 times more luminous when viewed from the brightest direction compared to when viewed from the least luminous direction .",
    "unfortunately , one of the components of the [ oii ] doublet and the h@xmath1 line are located on top of bright sky emission lines .",
    "we place an upper limit of the [ oii ] doublet flux by adding to the observed spectrum a simulated [ oii ] doublet for which each component has the same spatial and spectral width as the [ oiii ] line .",
    "we then scale the flux of the line and infer the lowest flux for which we would still have detected the line after spsf subtraction .",
    "the upper limit to the [ oii ] flux inferred this way is @xmath51 erg s@xmath13 @xmath41 .",
    "using the relation between [ oii ] luminosity and sfr from kennicutt ( 1998 ) , this limit implies an upper limit of sfr@xmath52 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 .",
    "hence , the non - detection is consistent with the value of sfr @xmath50 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 inferred from h@xmath0 .",
    "we stress that there are substantial uncertainties in the absolute fluxes , probably at least 30% , both due to the possibility of slit - loss and due to uncertainties in the flux calibration .",

    "the small velocity shift observed in the present case may be an indication that we observe a disk - like system with a line - of - sight that is close to parallel with the rotation axis .",
    "the profile of the high - ionisation civ line follows that of the low - ionisation lines , although component a is stronger than component b which is opposite to the relative strength of the two components for the low - ionisation lines .      the ly@xmath0 line is a resonant line , and the physical processes governing its formation are quite different from the metal lines . due to the effects of scattering , ly@xmath0 photons have a complex path out of galaxies (",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the profile of the line shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] is clearly asymmetric and remarkably the blue edge of the profile is close to the position of ly@xmath0 at the systemic redshift .",
    "even more striking is the presence of a small peak on the blue side of the systemic redshift .",
    "this can be understood as a result of resonant scattering . in general ,",
    "due to the high opacity of neutral hydrogen for a photon in the line centre , ly@xmath0 photons have to diffuse in frequency to either the blue or the red side .",
    "thus , to first order the line should be characterised by two symmetric peaks with the central minimum indicating the redshift ( harrington 1973 ; urbaniak & wolfe 1981 ) .",
    "although this has been observed on several occasions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , typically observations show that the blue peak is missing , leaving only the asymmetric red part with the distinct steep rise in intensity close to the line centre and more shallow decrease farthest from the centre .",
    "various scenarios may explain the weakness of the blue peak .",
    "in particular , if large outflows of gas are present , as may be expected in the presence of a starburst , in the reference frame of the outflowing hydrogen atoms blue photons are shifted towards the line centre , while red photons are shifted away from resonance . thus , the photons will escape more easily after having drifted to the red side . while no analytical solution exists for this scenario @xcite .",
    "] , it has been investigated numerically , both in the case of a homologous expansion @xcite and that of a thin , circumgalactic shell of gas @xcite .",
    "even if outflows are not present , after the photons escape the galaxy , the redshift due to the hubble expansion of the intergalactic medium may remove part of the blue peak . at @xmath90 , the average transmission bluewards of the ly@xmath0 line is 8085% @xcite .",
    "however , since in the vicinity of the galaxy the expansion is slower due to the gravitational potential of the galaxy , more absorption may occur close to the line centre . in the case of infalling gas ,",
    "even the red peak of the spectrum may be affected @xcite .",
    "considering the relatively high metallicity inferred for the system and the apparent depletion of refractory elements , the presence of dust is anticipated .",
    "due to the path length of the ly@xmath0 radiation being increased by resonant scattering , dust may suppress the ly@xmath0 line more than other lines .",
    "even for `` grey '' dust , the line is not affected uniformly , the wings being influenced more than the centre @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the wings are comprised of photons originating in the very dense regions that have to diffuse far from the line centre in order to escape , while photons near the line centre must come from low - density regions . since the dense regions are where also most of the stars are , and hence most of the dust , these photons have a higher probability of being absorbed .",
    "if we wish to understand the physical conditions responsible for the formation of the observed ly@xmath0 line , we must take all of these effects into account .",
    "an exact fit to the ly@xmath0 emission - line profile requires careful numerical modeling , varying a multitude of physical , and often degenerate , parameters . @xcite",
    "successfully modeled a number of ly@xmath0 profiles by varying the temperature , column density , expansion velocity and dust contents of a thin shell .",
    "analytical solutions exist only for homogeneous , isothermal , and static configurations of gas , with either a central or evenly distributed source of light . in the case of a homogeneous gas ,",
    "each of the two peaks are fairly symmetric about their maxima , but taking into account the full range of densities , and the correlation of ly@xmath0 emission with these densities , often results in significantly more skewed peaks .",
    "this is the result of different parts of the spectrum originating in physically distinct regions .",
    "a realistic scenario of galactic outflows probably lies somewhere in between that of the homologously expanding sphere and that of a thin shell . from fig .",
    "8 of @xcite , one sees that in the case of the expanding sphere with a maximum velocity @xmath91 of 20 km s@xmath13 , the red peak maximum is approximately twice as high as the blue peak maximum , while for @xmath92 km s@xmath13 the blue peak is missing completely . in the case of a shell , from fig .",
    "14 of @xcite slightly larger expansion velocities can occur while still allowing the blue peak to be seen .    considering the above discussion on the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 radiation , we find that the observed emission is consistent with originating at the same redshift as the systemic redshift , having scattered its way out of an inhomogeneous ism of gas temperature @xmath93 k , neutral hydrogen column density comparable to that inferred from the dla absorption , as well as a fair amount of dust absorbing @xmath361/2 of the photons , expanding at a typical velocity of several tens to @xmath36100 km s@xmath13 , and further having reduced its blue side somewhat by the surrounding igm .",
    "the progress on understanding the relation between emission- and absorption - selected galaxies at high redshift has been slow . today , more than 20 years after the onset of systematic studies of dlas ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ; smith et al .",
    "1989 ) and 15 years after the discovery of lbgs we still have very little empirical basis for establishing the relation between the two . here",
    "we have presented the results from the first dla observed in an x - shooter survey targeting metal - rich dlas , namely the @xmath94 dla towards q2222@xmath40946 .",
    "we confirm that our pre - selection of metal - rich dlas based on the strength of the siii @xmath111526 line works : the inferred metallicity of the system is [ zn / h ] = @xmath6 .",
    "we also clearly detect the galaxy counterpart of the dla absorber in ly@xmath0 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the dla - galaxy counterpart is a vigorously star - forming galaxy with a sfr of at least 10 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 .",
    "the line - of - sight probes the neutral gas associated with this galaxy at an impact parameter of about 6 kpc .",
    "the kinematical information inferred from emission and absorption suggests that we observe the galaxy with a line - of - sight that is close to parallel with its rotation axis . from the profile of ly@xmath0",
    ", we can infer that there most likely is a galactic wind causing the blueshifted part of the line to be absorbed .",
    "the implication of this is that we now have both the strategy ( selection of metal - rich dlas ) and the tool ( the x - shooter spectrograph ) that will allow us to attack the question of the nature of dla - galaxy counterparts",
    ".    it would also be interesting to further explore the inverse experiment , namely to characterise the hi absorption due to lbgs close to the sightlines to background qsos ( or other lbgs ) .",

    "<S> we have initiated a survey using the newly commissioned x - shooter spectrograph to target candidate relatively metal - rich damped lyman-@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) . </S>",
    "<S> our rationale is that high - metallicity dlas due to the luminosity - metallicity relation likely will have the most luminous galaxy counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the spectral coverage of x - shooter allows us to search for not only lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) emission , but also rest - frame optical emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen dlas where the strongest rest - frame optical lines ( [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 ) fall in the nir atmospheric transmission bands . in this first paper resulting from the survey </S>",
    "<S> , we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of the @xmath2 dla towards the @xmath3 quasar q2222@xmath40946 . </S>",
    "<S> this dla is amongst the most metal - rich @xmath5 dlas studied so far at comparable redshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> we measure metallicities from znii , siii , niii , mnii and feii of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy is detected in the ly@xmath0 , [ oiii ] @xmath114959 , @xmath115007 and h@xmath0 emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8 arcsec ( 6 kpc at @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the h@xmath0 line , we infer a star - formation rate of 10 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 , which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit - loss . compared to the recently determined h@xmath0 luminosity function for @xmath14 galaxies the dla - galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the emission - line ratios are 4.0 ( ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 ) and 1.2 ( [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ly@xmath0 line shows clear evidence for resonant scattering effects , namely an asymmetric , redshifted ( relative to the systemic redshift ) component and a much weaker blueshifted component . the fact that the blueshifted component is relatively weak indicates the presence of a galactic wind .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the galaxy counterpart of this dla is consistent with the prediction that metal - rich dlas are associated with the most luminous of the dla - galaxy counterparts .    </S>",
