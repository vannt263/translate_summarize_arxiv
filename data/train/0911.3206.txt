    "spin manipulation and control is at the core of spintronics , a technology that uses the spin of the electrons , rather than their charge , to transfer and/or process information.@xcite the rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling arising in materials lacking structural inversion symmetry@xcite plays a leading role in this field because its strength can be tuned by an applied electric field and by specific material engineering methods .",
    "the so induced lifted spin degeneracy may then be used in spin filtering devices and spin transistors .    whether the main effect of so coupling is limited to the spin splitting or it is accompanied by substantial modifications in other electronic properties , which could be detrimental for the spin propagation , is of course crucial for the functioning of spin - based devices . in this respect ,",
    "an important issue calls into play the role of the so interaction on the coupling of electrons to the lattice vibrations ( phonons ) . in particular , a sensible problem is whether the polaron , that is the quasiparticle composed by the electron and its phonon cloud , is strengthened or weakened by the rashba so interaction .    in previous works , an enhancement of the polaronic character has been obtained for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas with linear rashba coupling for both short - range ( holstein model ref . [ ] ) and long - range ( frhlich model ref .",
    "[ ] ) electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interactions.@xcite on the contrary , a recent calculation on the 2d tight - binding holstein - rashba model on the square lattice has shown that a large el - ph interaction gets effectively suppressed by the rashba so coupling.@xcite at present therefore the role of the rashba so coupling on the polaron properties is not clear , and different models and approximations appear to give quite contradicting results .    in this article the tight - binding holstein - rashba model for one electron coupled to adiabatic phonons is considered and the corresponding non - linear schrdinger equation for the polaron wave function is solved numerically .",
    "it is shown that , for el - ph couplings such that the electron is delocalized in the zero so limit , the rashba term creates a large polaron state , with polaron localization length inversely proportional to the so strength .",
    "furthermore , the small polaron regime appearing at large el - ph couplings and zero so gets weakened ( or even suppressed ) for sufficiently strong so couplings .",
    "hence , the holstein - rashba polaron is strengthened or weakened by the so interaction depending on whether the el - ph coupling is respectively weak or strong , thereby reconciling the different trends reported in refs .",

    "by presenting the spinor operator @xmath2 , where @xmath3 creates an electron with spin @xmath4 on site @xmath5 , the tight - binding holstein - rashba hamiltonian on the square lattice can be written as @xmath6 , where @xcite @xmath7 is the lattice hamiltonian for a free electron with transfer integral @xmath8 and so coupling @xmath0 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pauli matrices . the lattice constant is taken to be unity , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are unit vectors along the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions , respectively .",

    "the ( quasi- ) 2d materials and heterostructures which display non - zero rashba couplings ( semiconductor quantum wells , surface states of metals and semimetals ) are wide electron bandwidth systems with @xmath8 of the order of @xmath27 ev , while the typical phonon energy scale is of the order of few to tens mev.@xcite these systems are expected therefore to be well within the adiabatic regime @xmath28 . in the following , however , only the strict adiabatic limit @xmath29 is considered , which simplifies considerably the problem and , as shown below , permits to identify the critical parameters governing the electron localization transitions .    the adiabatic limit @xmath29 is obtained formally from eqs . and",
    "by setting @xmath30 and keeping @xmath31 finite .",
    "since for @xmath30 the phonon kinetic energy is zero , the ground state in the adiabatic limit is obtained by finding the displacement configuration @xmath32 which minimizes the total energy @xmath33 , where the brackets mean the expectation value with respect to the electron wave function and the lattice displacement .",
    "hence , since by hellmann - feynman theorem @xmath34 , the ground state energy becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 is independent of @xmath20 , and @xmath37 .",

    "let us discuss now the significance of the results reported above for materials of interest and possible consequences for spintronics applications .",

    "this is easily done by realizing that the largest rashba so coupling to date is that found in the surface stats of bi / ag(111 ) surface alloys@xcite for which @xmath113 can be estimated .",
    "other 2d systems and heterostructures have lower or much lower @xmath58 values .",
    "concerning the coupling to the phonons , a survey@xcite on the el - ph interaction at metal surfaces evidences that @xmath1 is usually lower than @xmath71-@xmath114 ( see also ref .",
    "[ ] ) , at least for the surface states with large so splittings ( _ i.e. _ ag , cu , bi ) .",
    "it is therefore a rather conserving assumption to confine to @xmath115 and @xmath116 the region of interest for the microscopic parameters which , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is substantially dominated by the so induced large polaron state . hence , upon tuning of the rashba so coupling , a delocalized electron at @xmath117 can in principle be changed into a self - trapped large polaron state for @xmath118 , with obvious consequences on the spin propagation in the system . in passing ,",
    "it is worth noticing that the small polaron regime instead is affected rather weakly by the so interaction for @xmath119 , while its weakening gets pronounced only for unrealistically large values of @xmath58 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    before concluding ,",
    "it is important to discuss a last important point .",
    "although the adiabatic limit employed here allows for a clear identification of the @xmath57 and @xmath55 transition lines , the energy gain associated to the large polaron formation becomes very small in the weak coupling and small so limits [ see eq .  ] . in this regime , the inclusion of quantum fluctuations which arise as soon as @xmath59 may wash out completely any signature ( like e.g. an anomalous enhancement of the electron effective mass @xmath120 ) of the large polaron state , even for @xmath121 small , while they should remain visible for larger @xmath1 and @xmath58 values . for a more complete description of the so effects on the holstein - rashba polaron , it is therefore necessary to extend the study to the non - adiabatic regime @xmath59 , by keeping however in mind that , as discussed above , relevant materials have @xmath122 .    in summary , the complete phase diagram of the 2d adiabatic holstein el - ph hamiltonian in the presence of rashba so coupling has been calculated .",
    "it has been shown that a self - trapped large polaron state is created by the so interaction in a wide region of the phase diagram , and that its localization radius can be modulated by the so coupling .",
    "this result implies that , for realistic values of the microscopic parameters , the appearance of a self - trapped large polaron state is a potentially detrimental factor for spin transport .",
    "it should be notes also that large so splittings are expected in systems whose constituting elements have large atomic number @xmath123 , and so large mass number . as a rule of thumb therefore ,",
    "larger values of @xmath0 are accompanied by lower phonon frequencies @xmath21 .      despite",
    "that lattices up to @xmath124 sites have been considered in compiling fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it has not been possible to identify with sufficient accuracy the delocalized electron / large polaron transition line @xmath55 for @xmath125 , because of the tiny energy differences involved ."
