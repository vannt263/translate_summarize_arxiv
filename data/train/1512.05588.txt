    "[ fig : sucpritrx ] for a fair comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : sucpritr ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the scheme with the ancilla permits multiple rydberg excitations of the register atoms , leading to their larger aggregate probability of decay and loss .",
    "we note that , for moderate values of the atomic decay and dephasing , digits @xmath143 in the marked element tend to cause larger error in the outcome , because the microwave detuning @xmath144 , which suppresses the @xmath38 gate on atom @xmath48 during the oracle operation , is large but still finite . more important",
    "are the relaxation processes which significantly degrade the performance of the algorithm with increasing evolution time . as a consequence , the probability for the correct measurement outcome may peak after fewer iterations than would be required to reach unity in the ideal case .",
    "it turns out that the errors due to the decay and dephasing on the qubit transition @xmath20 play a minor role , despite the slowness of the operations performed by the microwave field with small rabi frequency @xcite . the larger decay rate @xmath145 and higher probability of atom loss from the rydberg state @xcite are more damaging , and the most harmful element is the large dephasing @xmath146 of rydberg transition .",
    "so either the laser rabi frequency on the rydberg transition should be increased , as in panels ( a2,b2,c2 ) of figs .",
    "[ fig : sucpritr ] and [ fig : sucpritrx ] , so that the decay and dephasing have less time to destroy the atomic coherences , or @xmath147 should be reduced .",
    "while for the dephasing rate @xmath147 we took a typical experimental value , there is no theoretical argument why this value could not be reduced by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the grover search algorithm implementation with several rydberg blockaded atoms under realistic experimental conditions including the choice of parameters for the atomic decay , dephasing and interaction strengths .",
    "we have shown that relaxation processes cause decoherence during the quantum computation and reduce the probability of the correct outcome after a few iterations of the oracle and grover steps .",
    "the remarkable property of the grover algorithm is that it can tolerate moderate amount of errors without error correction , with the measurement on the final state of the system still leading to increased probability of the sought - after element of the database .",
    "when the probability for the correct outcome is larger than all the probabilities for incorrect outcomes , one may have recourse to perform several experimental runs and measurements and obtain the correct result by a majority vote .",
