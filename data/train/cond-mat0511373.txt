    "the anisotropy in these compounds is determined by the ratio @xmath21 and is rather high ( @xmath22 ) .  @xcite    according to electron structure calculation , _",
    "re_ni@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds are three - dimensional metals in which all atoms contribute to the density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c three energy bands crossing the fermi level subdivide the fermi surface into three distinct regions : ( 1 ) two spheroidal sheets at @xmath23-points that are extend along the @xmath3 axis ; ( 2 ) two flat p - centered square regions with the sides parallel to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and finally ( 3 ) the largest basic @xmath26-centered part mostly cylindrical in shape ( closely resembling practically two - dimensional crystal structure ) whose axis is parallel to the @xmath3 axis .",
    "@xcite in this sheet there are flat regions at the points @xmath27 , the nesting , typical for the compounds of this family .",
    "@xcite it is precisely these features that determine the kohn anomaly near the wave vector @xmath28  @xcite and the incommensurate ordering with @xmath28 in afm compounds .",
    "the part of the fermi surface responsible for nesting makes only @xmath29 and shows up a slightly increased resistance for the current along @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite    as was shown for point contacts with a ballistic transit of electrons in a many - band superconductor  @xcite , in any direction the contribution to conductivity from each band is proportional to the area of the fermi surface projection from the corresponding band onto the interface . since the fraction of the fermi surface responsible for nesting is small , the nesting - related features are not obvious in the point - contact spectra .",
    "thus , the fermi surface of nickel borocarbides consists of several bands : it is anisotropic and corresponding fermi velocity @xmath30 varies within wide limits . in this case",
    "@xmath10 is determined not by the total density of states @xmath31 , but by the narrow peak of the density of states at the fermi level ( see  @xcite , fig.12 ) .",
    "the density - of - states peak is induced by the slow electrons from the flat ( nesting ) regions of the fermi surface with the wave vectors ( 0.5 - 0.6,0,0 ) .",
    "@xcite    in the normal state the resistivity @xmath32 is isotropic because it is connected with the groups of electrons that have rather high velocities @xmath30 and do not belong to the flat regions of the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of resistance @xmath32 in single crystal yni@xmath1b@xmath1c and luni@xmath1b@xmath1c also exhibits this practically isotropic metallic behavior ( see  @xcite , fig.11 ) .    the scanning tunnel microscope measurements on luni@xmath1b@xmath1c give a rather low value of superconducting energy gap along the @xmath3 axis ( 4.2 k ) , @xmath33 @xmath8 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath2 plane ( @xmath35 @xmath5 ) for yni@xmath1b@xmath1c the gap data are greatly scattered , from @xmath36 @xmath8  @xcite to @xmath37 @xmath8  @xcite ( @xmath38 ) . the high ratio in  @xcite can be attributed to the estimation procedure : the gap was estimated from the positions of the maxima in the differential conductivity curve .",
    "the shape of the curve , however , suggests a considerable variation of the gap over the fermi surface , and the cited value of the gap is closer to its maximum rather than to its average magnitude . for a number of nickel borocarbides",
    "the ratio obtained from point contact measurements in the @xmath2 plane  @xcite is @xmath39 .    in the recently discovered superconductor mgb@xmath1",
    "the fermi surface is formed by two groups of energy bands having different dimensions , which determines a two - gap conductivity  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can expect a many - gap conductivity in nickel borocarbide compounds .",
    "note that the dhva data  @xcite also point to the presence of at least two or even three groups of the fermi velocities evidencing in favor of a two or three - band model . in",
    "@xcite the behavior of @xmath40 is considered within a two - band model .",
    "one band has low fermi velocities , high @xmath41 , @xmath10 , @xmath42 ( electron - phonon interaction ) parameters .",
    "however , all these characteristics are suppressed in the bound system by another band with high fermi velocities and smaller superconducting parameters . in this case",
    "the two - gap approximation commonly used for two - band superconductors  @xcite seems quite reasonable .    here",
    "we report the results on energy gap anisotropy that were obtained on the nickel borocarbide superconductor luni@xmath1b@xmath1c for the main crystallographic orientations - in the @xmath2 plane and along @xmath3 axis .",
    "this study is a logical extension of  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the one - gap approximation could not provide an accurate description of the experimental curves in the low temperatures region and use of the two - gap approach was contemplated .",
    "@xcite the largest and the smallest gaps were estimated in the @xmath2 plane and along @xmath3 direction at @xmath43 . besides , using the generalized btk  @xcite and beloborodkos  @xcite models , the lowest values of the largest gap were estimated in these directions as a function of temperature .",
    "@xcite owing to the high quality of the experimental curves ( no `` humps '' , or broad maxima at @xmath44 ) , the estimation was possible in the `` wings '' , i.e. in the regions of the experimental curves where the biases are higher than that at the differential resistance minima ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "below we show the results of the two - band calculation for luni@xmath1b@xmath1c obtained within two models  @xcite for experimental curves obtained before .",
    "@xcite in our opinion , the calculation most closely corresponds to the many - band character of the fermi surface in these compounds .",
    "the anisotropy is estimated qualitatively in each band using the parameter @xmath23 in the btk model ,  @xcite or @xmath46 in beloborodko s model .",
    "@xcite the calculation is compared with the results of one - gap fitting .",
    "the point - contact measurement was performed on single crystal luni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath47 @xmath5 ) grown by canfield and budko using a flux method .",
    "@xcite the crystals were thin ( @xmath48 mm ) plates with the @xmath3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the plate .",
    "the single crystal surface always has quite a thick layer on it in which superconductivity is either absent or strongly suppressed .",
    "point contacts between natural crystal faces therefore suffer from this disadvantage . for measurement in the @xmath2 plane , the crystal is usually cleaved , and the point contact is made between a metallic counterelectrode and the cleaved surface .",
    "the cleavage perpendicular to the @xmath3 direction is a technical challenge . to do this ,",
    "the crystal surface was cleaned with a @xmath49 @xmath50 solution in ethanol for several minutes .",
    "the properly etched crystal has metallic luster and its surface is free from colored film .",
    "the crystal was washed thoroughly in pure ethanol and than installed in contact - making device .",
    "as found subsequently , the etching conditions are very important for producing high - quality point - contacts .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath2 plane the measurements results seem to be indifferent to cleavage or etching - they are practically similar in both cases . but a deeper analysis ( see below ) reveals certain distinctions caused by defects in the cleavage surface .",
    "the other electrode was made of high - purity silver .",
    "the point contacts in the @xmath2 plane were fabricated between the edge of the prism - shaped @xmath51 electrode and freshly cleaved ( etched ) face of the single crystal ( shear technique  @xcite ) .",
    "the deviation from the direction perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis varied within @xmath52 . to made a contact in the @xmath3 direction , the `` needle - anvil '' geometry was used .",
    "the needle radius was 1 - 3 microns .",
    "the temperature was measured with a special insert ( similar to that in  @xcite ) .    the point contact resistance varied typically from several ohms to tens of ohms . to attain more detailed data , we selected point - contacts with the greatest possible tunneling which was judged from the presence of a differential resistance maximum at zero bias and the highest nonlinearity of the @xmath53-@xmath54 curves at biases @xmath55 typical for a nonperturbed superconducting surface in the contact neighborhood",
    ". unfortunately , we were able to take a complete set of curves in the whole range @xmath56 only on a few contacts . because of high resistance and long - term ( over 10 - 12 hours ) measurements of temperature , many of contacts were broken down .",
    "the measurements were made with the nearly equal temperature steps .",
    "there were taken 47 curves in the @xmath3 direction and 41 curves in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "some curves of the temperature series for the first derivatives @xmath57 of the luni@xmath1b@xmath1c - ag point contacts in the @xmath3 direction and in the @xmath2 plane are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",

    "the obtained diameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are very close in the order of magnitude to the coherence length in this compound ( @xmath65  @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite the model , however , interprets the superconducting order parameter and the energy gap as distinct magnitudes .",

    "when magnetic impurities are absent , @xmath77 tends to infinity and the equations describing the @xmath69 characteristics in  @xcite and in  @xcite coincide .",
    "the other approach was based on the generalized blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model commonly used to describe @xmath68 point contacts .",
    "the model allows for finite lifetime of quasiparticles @xmath78 determined by inelastic scattering , which leads to the broadening of the density of states in the superconductor  @xcite .",
    "formally , according to the previous theory , the btk - based results are obtained under condition of strong pair breaking @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the strict sense , the generalized btk model contains no gap . for any infinitesimal broadening parameter @xmath23 , at @xmath80 the density of states near fermi surface is nonzero . in theory",
    "@xcite , the order parameter is qualitatively analogous to the pseudogap in the generalized btk model .    in the two - gap approximation ,",
    "the general conductivity of the point contact is taken as a superposition of the conductivities from two regions of the fermi surface having their own gaps . in this case",
    "the experimental curves were fitted using the expression    @xmath81    @xmath5 is the coefficient , characterizing the contribution from the part of the fermi surface with the gap @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the scaling factor describing the intensity of the experimental curve . it is used to make the amplitudes of the theoretical and experimental curves equal . the best agreement between the shapes of the theoretical and experimental curves corresponding to the minimum @xmath84 deviation in the curve @xmath85",
    "was taken as the main criterion of fitting in both the models at low and moderate temperatures . when the temperature increases , the curves @xmath85 become flatter , which entails much uncertainly in estimation of @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the scale - factor @xmath83 is of primary importance .",
    "it is , as a rule , independent of temperature and at low temperatures it can be calculated quite accurately through averaging .",

    "noteworthy also is another point , namely , the limits of applicability of the two - gap approach to describing experimental data . in the strict sense",

    "the iteration method commonly used to fit theoretical and experimental curves is quite good when broadening is small . however , as the broadening @xmath23 becomes comparable with the gap ( or @xmath140 ) , this introduces an appreciable uncertainly into the results .",
    "the iteration method implies that during fitting the parameters change cyclically as the step is gradually decreased .",
    "it is expected that the error reduces with each step .",
    "our experiment shows that with high @xmath23 ( or @xmath46 ) this procedure brings us finally to a local minimum point which is dependent on starting @xmath70 , @xmath23 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath117 values and can not correspond to the global minimum .",
    "moreover , this method is not valid for the two - gap calculation . in our fitting procedure",
    "we therefore used the technique of coordinate descent with a postponed solution  @xcite .",
    "first , we specified an interval in which @xmath70 is searched for at a given temperature .",
    "the interval was then subdivided into equidistant parts @xmath141 .",
    "then @xmath23 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath117 were fitted for each @xmath142 . the method used in  @xcite",
    "does not imply that the error should decrease immediately after each @xmath23 ( or @xmath46 ) step .",
    "the errors are compared after each @xmath23 ( or @xmath46 ) step only when the @xmath117-fitting is completed ( this accounts for the term `` postponed solution '' ) . in the programming language , the calculation by this method reduces to embedded cycles . in the one - gap model , the @xmath117-fitting is an inner cycle and the @xmath23 ( or @xmath46 ) fitting is an outer cycle . in the two - band calculation ,",
    "the @xmath117-fitting is the innermost cycle , the fittings in @xmath143 and @xmath114 become outer and , finally , the @xmath97-fitting is the outermost cycle .",
    "this method provides an unambiguous solution independed of the starting parameters . in the process of calculation",
    "the intensities of the theoretical and experimental curves were equalized and aligned over the ordinate before each step of calculation of the average @xmath84 deviation @xmath144 . to do this ,",
    "the @xmath145-coordinates of the points in the theoretical curve were multiplied by the scale factor @xmath83 ( the procedure of making the amplitudes of the theoretical and experimental curves equal ) .",
    "the curve was then shifted along the @xmath145-axis by amount @xmath19 .",
    "the values of @xmath83 and @xmath19 were found from the condition of the minimum @xmath144 .",
    "the standard algorithm for determination of these coefficients known as the least - square method is considered , for instance , in  @xcite . as a result , for each @xmath142 we could obtain @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath117 at which the difference between the shapes of the theoretical and experimental curves characterized by the @xmath84 deviation @xmath144 was the smallest one .",
    "the kind of calculation for different temperatures is illustrated in  @xcite ( fig.3 ) .",
    "in the two - gap case , the @xmath144-curves are more flattened , and the curve has no minimum at a temperature lower than in the one - gap case . however , before this happens , we are able , as a rule , to find quite accurately the scale - factor @xmath83 which is independent of temperature but is strongly dependent on @xmath70 (  @xcite , fig.4 )",
    ". the value of @xmath83 can vary from contact to contact but it is invariant for a particular contact . to put it more accurately , at the values of @xmath148",
    ", @xmath83 is practically invariable for the minima in the curves @xmath85 ( see fig . 9 in  @xcite ) . by choosing @xmath70-values which correspond to the determined magnitudes of @xmath83",
