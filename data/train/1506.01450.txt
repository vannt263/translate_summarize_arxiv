    "the superradiance transition ( st ) was first described by dicke in 1954 @xcite .",
    "the st is normally associated with a significant enhancement of the spontaneous radiation due to quantum coherent effects .",
    "later it was demonstrated that the st occurs in many quantum optical systems , nuclear systems ( heavy nuclei decay ) , nano- and bio - systems @xcite .",
    "the st usually occurs when the discrete ( intrinsic ) states of the system interact with the continuum spectra ( sinks ) .",
    "then , an adequate approach for describing the eigenstates and the dynamics of the system can be based on an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian for intrinsic states @xcite . in this case , the eigenenergies of the non - hermitian hamiltonian become complex .",
    "recently , a stady - state superradiant laser with less than one intracavity photon was demonstrated with rubidium-87 atomic dipoles @xcite .",
    "large enhancement of frster resonance energy transfer on graphene platforms was discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , a superradiant plasmonic lasing with a giant gain at the palsmon modes in graphene",
    "was theoretically analyzed in a wide thz frequency range .",
    "qualitatively , the st occurs when the resonances begin to overlap  the spacing between the resonances becomes of the order of the sum of half - widths of these resonances . with further overlapping of resonances , segregation of the eigenenergies takes place , depending on their decay widths .",
    "namely , the wide superradiant eigenstates provide rapid and coherent decay of the initially populated state in the continuum .",
    "the subradient eigenstates , with narrow decay widths , survive for a relatively long time .",
    "note , that not only the overlapping of resonances and the segregation of the eigenenergies are important for the occurrence of the superradiance , but the initial population of the system is also important .",
    "all these effects are described in details in @xcite .    in this letter , we determine theoretically and numerically the conditions at which the st occurs in a single - layer graphene material .",
    "we demonstrate how the st in this system is related to both the occurrence of an exceptional points ( ep ) , when complex eigenvalues coincide , and to the overlapping of two resonances .",
    "we also show that , under some conditions on the parameters and initial populations , the maximal efficiency of the electron transfer ( et ) into the sink is related to the st .",
    "we compare the st criterion based on the overlapping of resonances and on the occurrence of the ep .",
    "the structure of a single atomic layer graphene can be described by the honeycomb lattice which consists of two triangular bravais sublattices , represented in fig .",

    "six electrons occupy the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 orbitals . from them , four valence electrons are responsible for structural and electronic properties .",
    "one of the valence electrons of each a and b atoms occupies the @xmath0 orbital , which is orthogonal the graphene plane .",
    "the hybridization of these @xmath0 orbitals provides the formation of the @xmath7-bands in graphene .",
