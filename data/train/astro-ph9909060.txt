    "the ejection of particles by radiation pressure has been considered many times as a possible mechanism for producing relativistic outflows from very luminous radiation sources , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or galactic compact objects . in the case of an optically thin plasma , the particle dynamics",
    "is dominated by the intense photon field and a flow results from the work done by the radiation force on the material .",
    "in most previous studies it was assumed that the particles scatter photons with a cross section independent of frequency and front - to - back symmetric along the incident photon direction , such as true in the thomson limit ( noerdlinger 1974 ; odell 1981 ; phinney 1982 ; kovner 1984 ) .",
    "direct momentum input to the fluid at rest results when outward - directed photons are removed from the anisotropic radiation field , and then scattered away .",
    "no net momentum is carried off by the scattered photons and the material is accelerated radially .",
    "a particle moving outward near the source , however , encounters many photons nearly at right angles to its motion , more so as @xmath2 because of aberration effects , and suffers collisional drag by them .",
    "only mildly relativistic flows can be produced by an eddington - limited extended source , the radiation drag actually preventing acceleration to very high particle energies ( noerdlinger 1974 ) . in the context of agns , the role of compton drag in the dynamics of relativistic jets has been the subject of many studies ( e.g. abramowicz & piran 1980 ; sikora & wilson 1981 ; phinney 1987 ; melia & knigl 1989 ; sikora 1996 ) .    in the past few years",
    ", the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ mission has revealed the existence of some classes of objects , such as the egret ( fichtel 1994 ) , osse ( mcnaron - brown 1995 ) , and comptel ( bloemen 1995 ) blazars , together with some @xmath0-ray pulsars ( ulmer 1994 ) , where the hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes are a significant fraction or completely dominate the overall radiation energy budget .",
    "this is similar to what sometimes observed by the sigma experiment onboard of _ granat _ in the case of galactic black hole candidates ( mandrou 1994 ) .",
    "the large compactnesses inferred from these data naturally lead to theoretical models in which compton scattering in the klein - nishina ( kn ) limit ( as opposed to thomson scattering ) , together with photon - photon pair production may play a role in determining the thermal state and dynamics of the source .",
    "such process may also be relevant for studies of the effects of gamma - ray bursts on their gaseous environment ( their `` afterglows '' ) .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of a _ cold _ plasma embedded in the  hard \" photon field of an external source .",
    "we adopt a test - particle approach , which is valid only insofar gas pressure gradients can be neglected compared to the radiative force and the material is optically thin .",
    "we consider the model problem of a fully ionized plasma where gravity is overwhelmed by radiation pressure and the distribution of particle momenta remains one - dimensional .",
    "we ignore stimulated scattering , photon absorption , and photon - electron pair production .",
    "free - free absorption is unimportant compared to thomson scattering if @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the electron density .",
    "photo - electron pair production , @xmath6 ( threshold @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the photon energy in the electron rest - frame ) is a higher order process in the fine - structure constant , important only at large energies . ( the pair production cross section is @xmath9 of the kn scattering cross section at @xmath10 , e.g. svensson 1982 . ) in an accompanying paper ( thompson & madau 1999 , hereafter paper ii ) we show , however , how pair creation induced by collisions between hard photons and soft side - scattered photon may increase the acceleration rate by decreasing the inertia per particle , and by increasing the mean momentum deposited per scattering .    the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss the basic theory of radiative acceleration . in ",
    "3 we present sample solutions for extended and impulsive radiation sources in the thomson regime .",
    "compton drag by side - scattered radiation is shown to be more effective in limiting the bulk motion than is the finite inertia of the accelerating medium . the random energy imparted to the plasma by @xmath0-rays",
    "can be converted into bulk motion if the hot particles execute many larmor orbits before cooling .",
    "the equation of motion in the kn limit is derived and numerically integrated in  4 for a monoenergetic spectrum , under the assumption that the outflowing particles maintain a one - dimensional distribution of momenta , i.e. that the plasma remains ` cold ' even in the presence of recoil .",
    "blumenthal ( 1974 ) used the kn cross section to calculate the mean force due to compton scattering on electrons with arbitrary velocity .",
    "an approximate solution to the problem of the radiative deceleration of a relativistic jet in the kn regime has been recently given by luo & protheroe ( 1999 ) .",
    "consider an optically thin plasma exposed to a photon source .",
    "the incident and scattered photon momenta ( in units of @xmath11 ) are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the ( unprimed ) lab frame .",

    "the energy of the scattered photon is @xmath29 in this notation , the scattering takes place through a polar angle @xmath30 and an azimuthal angle @xmath31 .",
    "measuring the angles @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the incident and scattered photon with respect to the electron velocity @xmath34 , we can write the following kinematic relations @xmath35 since the scattering cross section is independent of the azimuth @xmath31 , we must integrate equation ( [ eq : eqp ] ) over two angles , @xmath30 and @xmath36 .",
    "the evaluation of the integral in equation ( [ eq : eqp ] ) will be made by assuming that the radiation field is symmetric around the @xmath37-axis , and the electrons ( and positrons ) will maintain a one - dimensional distribution of momenta along @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "note that multiple scatterings can be safely neglected , as the singly scattered photons are beamed into a cone of half - angle @xmath39 along the electron direction of motion .",
    "further scatterings are therefore suppressed by the @xmath40 factor in the momentum transfer equation .",
    "single side - scattered photons will , however , be absorbed via @xmath41 if the compactness of the @xmath0-ray source is high at @xmath42 .",

    "if @xmath51 , the force reverses , being now directed inward .",
    "this saturation of the lorentz factor is due to the aberration into the forward hemisphere of blueshifted photons , as seen in the electron rest - frame .",
    "a particle will follow the @xmath52 equilibrium trajectory ( zero - inertia limit ) until , as it gets farther from the source , its acceleration is effectively limited by the large doppler shift to the red and by the @xmath53 decline of the radiation flux .",

    "bulk motion starting with @xmath75 at a distance @xmath76 from the source is quickly decelerated to @xmath77 , and the excess kinetic energy converted into a collimated beam of upscattered photons .",
    "infinite , keplerian accretion disks around black holes provide an example of non - uniform radiating sources where compton drag is most severe .",

    "the peak flux , @xmath80 @xmath81 , is reached at @xmath82 .",
    "one can understand the essential features of the accretion disk model by approximating the flux distribution as @xmath83 in this case the equilibrium lorentz factor increases only as @xmath84 ( compared to a linear increase for a spherical source ) . in the point - source limit , one derives @xmath85 , where @xmath59 is now the nominal disk compactness , @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "again , by matching the two limiting solutions , the asymptotic bulk lorentz factor is found to scale as @xmath88 ( kovner 1984 ; phinney 1987 ) .",
    "the exact solutions for a spherical uniform source and a keplerian accretion disk are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the latter is a much less efficient accelerator than the former because of the large photon drag associated with a radiation source extending to infinity .",
    "the radiative force acting on an external medium induces a flow that is strongly time - dependent .",
    "one important effect of acceleration to bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 is the bunching of the accelerated material into a shell of thickness @xmath89 .",
    "let us now solve for the density of the accelerated material .",
    "the equation of continuity of the hadronic component is @xmath90 material initially at radius @xmath91 reaches a radius @xmath92 at time @xmath93 ( speed @xmath94 ) . here , @xmath95 .",
    "the total duration of the acceleration is @xmath96 eliminating @xmath91 from these two equations and taking @xmath97 at constant time @xmath93 , one derives @xmath98 , and we have @xmath99 this integrates to @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the proton density in the undisturbed ambient medium .",
    "there is a corresponding amplification of the non - radial component of a magnetic field entrained in the flow , @xmath102      gamma - ray sources such as blazars and gamma - ray bursts are impulsive .",
    "it is instructive , therefore , to consider a photon source that maintains a constant luminosity for a time @xmath103 .",
    "this source can be visualized as a uniform shell of radius @xmath104 , thickness @xmath105 , and total flux @xmath106 .",
    "we focus here on the effects of a radiation pulse and take the photons to move radially before scattering .",
    "the compactness within the shell can be expressed directly in terms of the flux of @xmath0-rays , @xmath107 and thence in terms of a characteristic photon optical depth , multiplied by the frequency @xmath108 at which the spectrum peaks . ]",
    "@xmath109 such that @xmath110 .",
    "material overtaken by the photon shell at radius @xmath48 , and accelerated from rest , develops a large bulk lorentz factor when @xmath111 . integrating equation ( [ eq : eqps ] ) in this limit yields @xmath112 at a radius @xmath113 . as the difference between the particle speed and the speed of light decreases as @xmath114 , the accelerated matter will surf the photon shell over an extended range of radius , @xmath115 .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor is therefore @xmath116 when the shell is thin enough that the acceleration length is much less than the radius , @xmath117 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "only a limited amount of material can be accelerated to this value . equating the kinetic energy within a volume @xmath118 with the energy of",
    "the photon shell implies a very high pre - existing optical depth to compton scattering , @xmath119 . since",
    "our calculation of @xmath120 is valid only for small @xmath121 , the ambient density at radius @xmath48 is bounded above by @xmath122 note the strong dependence on @xmath21 .",
    "we will show is paper ii that , even if the ambient medium is composed of a hadronic plasma initially ( as is expected in most cosmological gamma - ray burst models ) , the mean mass per scattering charge will be rapidly reduced to @xmath123 by pair creation .",
    "sidescattered photons will provide additional drag that reduces @xmath1 below the value given in equation ( [ eq : gams ] ) .",
    "as the photon shell propagates ahead of an accelerating parcel of matter , it generates an isotropic radiation field of photon density @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the density of scattering charges in the ambient medium at rest , and @xmath126 is the lengthscale over which isotropic scattering occurs ( before the scattering medium gets accelerated to relativistic velocities ) .",
    "the net effect is to introduce a second , negative term into equation ( [ eq : eqps ] ) , which becomes @xmath127 at large @xmath1 .",
    "acceleration up to lorentz factor @xmath120 is then possible only if the ambient density is lower than @xmath128 this bound is stronger by a factor @xmath129 than equation ( [ eq : rhom ] ) : _ in the thomson scattering regime , the bulk lorentz factor is actually limited by side - scattered radiation_. this conclusion changes when the photon source is very hard , because side - scattered photons are immediately consumed by pair creation ( paper ii ) .",
    "a compact source of @xmath0-rays always tends , in this sense , to maintain a radial photon distribution .",
    "it is well known that a hot ( relativistic ) plasma in an anisotropic radiation field feels a much larger radiation pressure than a cold ( non - relativistic ) gas of the same inertial mass ( odell 1981 ) , and tends to drive itself away from the radiation source with momentum derived largely from the anisotropic loss of its own internal energy .",
    "this `` compton rocket '' is , however , ineffective at generating bulk relativistic motion from internal random kinetic energy , as it is always accompanied by catastrophic compton cooling ( phinney 1982 ) . nonetheless , by integrating the momentum equation in the limiting case of a cold plasma we are actually underestimating its bulk lorentz factor",
    ": the gas will be continuously heated by the hard radiation field itself , hot particles will radiate most of their energy in the direction of the radiation source , and part of the energy of relativistic random motion will be converted into bulk motion .",
    "we term this supplementary source of momentum the ` compton afterburn ' .",
    "the afterburn can be largely neglected in the case of pure kn scattering without pair creation (  4.1 ) .",
    "( in paper ii we will consider a situation in which relativistic @xmath130 pairs are injected into an anisotropic photon beam by collisions between side - scattered photons and the main beam  thereby inducing a net force on the plasma as they compton cool . ) nonetheless , we discuss it here for completeness .",
    "the afterburn is strongest when the radiative force on the relativistic , cooling particles is coupled to the rest of the fluid through a background magnetic field . above a critical flux density which we estimate , this allows the colder particles to dominate the inertia of the flow , and the momentum gained by compton scattering to be more effectively absorbed rather than being radiated away .",
    "the afterburn is easiest to analyze when the period of a cyclotron orbit is much shorter than the compton cooling time .",
    "then the linear momentum imparted to one charge is effectively shared with the others before the charge loses its excess energy in the bulk frame .",
    "we also assume that the acceleration time is long compared with the compton cooling time , so that the proportion of energetic particles is small .",
    "this is the case when the energetic charges are continually regenerated , e.g. , by pair creation .",
    "finally , we assume that the magnetic field is non - radial ( as is appropriate to the rest frame of a plasma that has been accelerated to relativistic speed ) .",
    "we divide the velocity of the charge into components @xmath131 and @xmath132 perpendicular and parallel to @xmath133 , and denote by @xmath134 the angle between the cyclotron motion and the radial direction .",
    "the charge is immersed in a collimated photon beam of energy flux @xmath135 in the boosted frame of the bulk flow .",
    "it feels a radial force ( odell 1981 ) @xmath136.\\ ] ] the net radial momentum imparted to the cooling charge is obtained by averaging over a cyclotron orbit , @xmath137 , @xmath138 at the same time , the net energy lost to compton cooling is @xmath139    when the energetic charges are created with @xmath140 ( e.g. , pair creation between a hard radial photon and a soft side - scattered photon ) , the cooling rate is @xmath141 and the radial momentum gained as the particle cools is @xmath142 to leading order in @xmath143 , @xmath144 in this case , the source of energy for the charge is external to the accelerating medium .",
    "the charge carries an excess lab - frame momentum @xmath145 , which is supplemented by ( [ eq : prad ] ) to yield a total @xmath146 ( in the limit @xmath147 ) .",
    "these expressions change slightly when the energetic charges are distributed isotropically , and reduce to those found by odell ( 1981 ) .",
    "the rate of compton cooling is @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 , as usual , and @xmath151 the _ net _ radial momentum acquired is @xmath152 only @xmath153 of the value obtained for charges that are created moving parallel to the photon beam .",
    "these calculations assume that a high energy particle will execute many cyclotron orbits before compton cooling .",
    "let us check when this assumption is valid .",
    "the rest frame magnetic flux density is related to the initial ( non - radial ) field before acceleration by @xmath154 ( eq . [ eq : bnew ] ) .",
    "each fresh ( radially - moving ) particle has a rest - frame energy @xmath155 , and so it takes a time @xmath156 to complete one radian of a larmor orbit .",
    "the compton cooling time is @xmath157 the energy flux in a thin photon shell is related to the characteristic optical depth @xmath158 ( eq . [ eq : tauc ] ) through @xmath159 , and so the ratio of these two timescales is @xmath160    the compression of the accelerating medium has a related consequence : the mean energy @xmath161 of the scattering charges in the bulk frame increases due to adiabatic heating , at a rate @xmath162 in the lab frame .",
    "a balance between compressional heating and compton cooling results in an equilibrium energy @xmath161 that is only mildly relativistic . as a result",

    ", one sees that energetic particles cool faster than the bulk flow accelerates .",

    "it has been recently pointed out that compton heating of electrons by hard x - ray background photons may provide a significant energy source for the intergalactic medium ( madau & efstathiou 1999 ) .",
    "it is crucial in the cosmological context to use equation ( [ eq : hcomp ] ) rather the thomson limit , as relativistic corrections become increasingly more important at early times when the peak in spectral power of the x - ray background ( observed today at @xmath207 kev ) is blueshifted to higher energies .",
    "it is also worth noting that the efficiency of the compton afterburn should be further diminished in the kn regime , as the decreased relativistic cross section reduces the anisotropy ( between highly scattering electrons moving towards the source and those , less scattering , moving away ) that ultimately drives the effect ( phinney 1982 ; see also renaud & henry 1998 ) .",

    "<S> we consider the radiative acceleration to relativistic bulk velocities of a cold , optically thin plasma which is exposed to an external source of @xmath0-rays . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is driven by radiative momentum input to the gas , the accelerating force being due to compton scattering in the relativistic klein - nishina limit . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk lorentz factor of the plasma , @xmath1 , derived as a function of distance from the radiating source , is compared with the corresponding result in the thomson limit . depending on the geometry and spectrum of the radiation field , we find that particles are accelerated to the asymptotic lorentz factor at infinity much more rapidly in the relativistic regime ; and the radiation drag is reduced as blueshifted , aberrated photons experience a decreased relativistic cross section and scatter preferentially in the forward direction . </S>",
    "<S> the random energy imparted to the plasma by @xmath0-rays can be converted into bulk motion if the hot particles execute many larmor orbits before cooling . </S>",
    "<S> this ` compton afterburn ' may be a supplementary source of momentum if energetic leptons are injected by pair creation , but can be neglected in the case of pure klein - nishina scattering . </S>",
    "<S> compton drag by side - scattered radiation is shown to be more important in limiting the bulk lorentz factor than the finite inertia of the accelerating medium . </S>",
    "<S> the processes discussed here may be relevant to a variety of astrophysical situations where luminous compact sources of hard x- and @xmath0-ray photons are observed , including active galactic nuclei , galactic black hole candidates , and gamma - ray bursts .    </S>",
