    "throughout the past few decades , problems of computer science have become subjects of intense interest to theoretical physicists as novel paradigms of complex systems that could benefit from theoretical approaches and insights inspired by statistical physics .",
    "these include neural networks , boltzmann machines and deep learning , compressed sensing , satisfiability problems , and a host of other approaches to data mining and machine learning @xcite .",
    "the interest in the constraints on computation and information processing placed by physical laws is even older and dates to work by landauer and bennett @xcite .",
    "one of the holy grails at the interface between physics and computer science is the physical realization of a large - scale quantum computer in which the processing of information makes use of quantum - mechanical concepts such as superposition and entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , building a quantum computer remains a challenging task : while very powerful and universal , the notion of quantum computing requires maintaining coherence over the duration of the computation , and strategies devised to fight decoherence @xcite require very stringent conditions that have not yet been fully met in practice .",
    "this paper , which hopes to bring a new class of problems to the physics - computer science interface , introduces a two - dimensional ( 2d ) representation of a generic reversible classical computation , the result of which is encoded in the ground state of a statistical mechanics vertex model with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the vertex model is defined in terms of boolean variables ( or spins degrees of freedom ) placed on the bonds or links of an anisotropic 2d lattice with vertices representing logic gates .",
    "the corresponding gate constraints are implemented through short - ranged one- and two - body interactions involving the spins of the vertex ( as we show , this construction can be realized in physical programmable machines , such as the d - wave machine @xcite ) .",
    "one direction of the lattice represents `` computational ( rather than real ) time '' , as introduced by feynman in the history representation of quantum computation @xcite , but here used for classical reversible circuits .",
    "the two boundaries of the lattice transverse to the `` time '' direction contain the input and output bits of the computation .",
    "it is important to stress that we are not limiting ourselves to forward computations with fixed inputs .",
    "more interesting are problems in which only partial information about both inputs and outputs is known . in that case , reaching the ground state requires flow of information both forwards and backwards across the lattice , processes that are naturally built into our approach .",
    "the idea of encoding classical computation in the ground state of a many - body spin model was introduced earlier for irreversible computation in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we focus on reversible rather than irreversible computation in order to address problems with both fixed - input and mixed - boundary conditions on inputs and outputs , as explained above .",
    "mapping onto a regular 2d lattice as opposed to an arbitrary graph allows us to use intuitive ideas from equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , especially of classical and quantum phase transitions . also , while in ref .",
    "@xcite an error correction scheme was required to implement fault tolerant computation , in our scheme accurate computation without error correction is possible below moderate temperatures that scale only as the inverse of the logarithm of the system size , a consequence of the exponential scaling of the static correlation length with inverse temperature ( see below ) .",
    "most importantly , our work emphasizes that the dynamics of relaxation to the ground state rather than the thermodynamics of the model is essential for understanding the implications and complexity of ground state computation .    before launching into the main body of the paper",
    ", we would like to summarize our results and comment on their significance .",
    "first , we show through an exact calculation that , irrespective of the details of the classical computation , the thermodynamics of the corresponding lattice model with either open or fixed - input boundary conditions shows no phase transition down to zero temperature .",
    "in particular , the resulting thermodynamic behavior is that of a paramagnet .",
    "we argue that this thermodynamic behavior is a bulk property , and is unaffected by changes of boundary conditions .",
    "the absence of a thermodynamical phase transition removes an obvious impediment to reaching the ground state of the vertex model . for instance , a suboptimal mapping from a computational problem into a physical system may place the solution within a glassy phase , even in the case of easy computational problems .",
    "the mapping of xorsat ( a problem in p ) into a diluted @xmath0-spin model is such an example  @xcite .",
    "the fact that our vertex model is free of thermodynamic transitions does not mean that one can always reach the ground state easily .",
    "in this paper we will focus on problems with a unique solution encoded by a vertex model with a unique ground state .",
    "this is a problem in the complexity class unique - sat , which under randomized reduction is as hard as sat  @xcite .",
    "hence , even in the absence of a thermodynamic transition finding the unique ground state of vertex models encoding problems with a single solution is a problem in np - complete  @xcite .",
    "of course , this statement does not mean that one can not benefit from speed - ups allowed by either physics inspired heuristics or by special - purpose physical hardware , such as quantum annealers .",
    "this paper focuses on the study of vertex - model representations of random circuits for which the complexity of the computation is reflected in the concentration of toffoli gates , the length of the input and output boundaries @xmath1 , and the depth of the circuit @xmath2 .",
    "this highlights another important aspect of the physics - inspired perspective , namely the interest in `` typical '' and `` average '' behavior rather than in worst - case scenarios .",
    "more precisely , here we focus on typical problems , _",
    "i.e. _ , problems randomly drawn from the @xmath3 possible classical computations encoded in vertex models with fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and a given concentration of toffoli gates . furthermore ,",
    "as motivated below , we concentrate on computational problems with a single solution  or problems for which one can discern among an @xmath4 number of solutions with a small overhead  a class of problems that encompass factoring of semi - primes , an important and nontrivial example that we shall explore in a future publication .    as stressed above , the absence of a thermodynamic phase transition independent of circuit underscores the fact that it is not the thermodynamics but rather the dynamics that reflects the computational complexity of a specific problem .",
    "indeed , this complexity is encoded in the behavior of the rate of relaxation to the ground state as a function of the size and depth of the computation .",
    "the simplest way of studying this behavior is via thermal annealing @xcite by using a ramp protocol , @xmath5 , to cool the system , starting from the scale @xmath6 down to zero temperature , over a total time duration @xmath7 . at any temperature @xmath8 along the annealing path ,",
    "the correlation length is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the thermal correlation length in the paramagnetic state , and @xmath6 is a characteristic ferromagnetic interaction strength in our model . in thermal equilibrium all gate constraints defining the computational circuit would be satisfied once @xmath11 reaches the depth of the computation , @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the exponential dependence of @xmath11 on temperature implies that achieving the correct assignment of gates does not require very low temperatures on the scale of @xmath6 since @xmath12 already for temperatures below @xmath13 .",
    "however , reaching the solution to the computational problem is a dynamical process that can not proceed to completion until the _ dynamic correlation length _ at the end of the annealing protocol , @xmath14 , reaches @xmath2 , allowing the input and output boundaries of the system that specify the computation to communicate . in this paper",
    ", we identify this dynamical correlation length and study its scaling behavior numerically .",
    "not surprisingly , thermal annealing is not the most efficient dynamical path for bringing a system to solution .",
    "for instance , computations that proceed from a fully specified input boundary reach solution when @xmath15 .",
    "however , @xmath16 grows slower than ballistically ( i.e. , linearly in @xmath7 ) , and thus the time - to - solution derived from simple annealing does not scale linearly in @xmath2 , as expected for forward computation .",
    "a more efficient approach is to use a `` learning '' protocol which involves repeated annealing procedures applied to a large number , @xmath17 , of identical replicas of the system over periods of time @xmath18 , during which the dynamical correlation length grows beyond a few layers of vertices .",
    "after each annealing interval @xmath18 , a histogram of possible states is built for every gate in the system , and some of the vertices are assigned particular states provided that a majority of replicas greater than a cutoff agree on the assignment .",
    "subsequent annealing protocols are only applied to the remaining `` unpinned '' gates , a process which is repeated @xmath19 times , until all vertices in the system are fixed .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : learning_forward ] , this protocol initiates a finite strip of matched vertices input boundary , which provide the initial condition for the next annealing cycle , thus pushing the computation forward .",
    "the `` annealing with learning '' protocol requires @xmath20 steps , leading to a time to solution @xmath21 that is linear in depth of the computation @xmath2 , thus matching the scaling of deterministic forward computation .    for computations with `` mixed boundary conditions '' defined by partially fixing bits on both input and output boundaries , communication between the two boundaries",
    "is necessary but not sufficient for negotiating the solution . whether implemented by traditional thermal annealing or by `` annealing with learning '' , we find that the evolution to solution is arrested for both cases of multiple or no solutions , as we exemplify in our numerical studies . by contrast , for problems with a single solution the `` annealing with learning '' protocol provides an unencumbered path to solution , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : learning_mixed ] .",
    "we note that , although unique - sat and sat problems are both in np - complete , the behavior of `` typical '' unique - sat examples drawn from random vertex models corroborates the physical intuition that solutions to problems with non - degenerate ground states are not slowed down by the competition among degenerate domains .",
    "finally , we note that reaching the ground state of the vertex model could be accelerated by replacing classical annealing with quantum annealing  @xcite .",
    "while approaching computational problems through quantum annealing is left for future investigations , the current paper includes the formal derivation of the quantum version of the statistical mechanics model of reversible classical computation .",
    "this provides the background for another novel result of the paper , namely the explicit mapping of our lattice model onto the chimera architecture of the d - wave machine , a development that points to the potential usefulness of the vertex model as a programming platform for special purpose quantum annealers .",

    "in this section we formulate reversible classical computations by laying logic circuits in a two - dimensional structure of tiles covering the plane ( sec .  [ sec : tile - model ] ) and discuss the vertex model , a more compact representation of the tile model ( sec .  [",
    "sec : strong_coupling ] ) that defines the context for the computational results of this paper .",
    "our starting point is the fact that any boolean function can be implemented in terms of toffoli gates , which are reversible logic gates with three inputs and three outputs . starting from a circuit of toffoli gates , our construction proceeds by first using swap gates to repeatedly swap distant bits in the input that are acted upon by particular gates of the circuit , until the operation of every gate is reduced to adjacent bits .",
    "the second step is to associate tiles with each of the gates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gate_tile_coupling ] , where one should imagine placing input and output bits at the intersections of the tile surfaces with the horizontal lines , as will be described in detail shortly .",
    "the tiles representing the gates can then be laid down side - by - side in a plane to implement the computational circuit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ripple - carry ] for the example of the `` ripple - carry adder '' , which computes the carry bit that is `` rippled '' to the next bit when adding two numbers @xcite .",

    "implied in the figure is that adjacent tiles share bits along common boundaries .     and set it to 1 to implement the original cnot gate with a toffoli gate .",

    "the subsections bellow will set up the general framework and formulate approaches that form the basis of both the results of this paper and of work we are planning for the future .",
    "we start by representing boolean variables @xmath23 in terms of spins @xmath24 placed on the boundary of each tile , as depicted in fig  [ fig : gate_tile_coupling ] .",
    "operations of logic gates are then implemented in a similar way as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by designing a hamiltonian acting on the spins associated with individual tiles such that ( a ) the interactions are short ranged and involve at most two bodies ; and ( b ) spin ( i.e. , bit ) states that satisfy the gate constraint are ground states of the tile hamiltonian and all other `` unsatisfying '' spin - states are pushed to high energies .",
    "* identity ( i d ) gate : * the i d gate takes two bits @xmath25 into @xmath25 .",
    "this is easily enforced by adding ferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath26 ) that align input bits @xmath27 and @xmath28 to output bits @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , leading to an energy @xmath31    * swap gate : * the swap gate takes @xmath25 into @xmath32 , and can be implemented in the same manner as the i d gate through a ferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath33 * toffoli gate : * the toffoli gate is represented by a rectangular tile with the three input bits @xmath34 and three output bits @xmath35 placed on the boundary , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gate_tile_coupling ] .",
    "notice that in this case we also place an additional ancilla bit in the center of the rectangular tile , which is essential in order to satisfy the gate constraint with no more than two - body interactions .",

    "the copying of the first two input bits from the input into the output is accomplished as before through a ferromagnetic coupling : @xmath38 .",
    "enforcing the third output bit @xmath39 requires a more involved interaction .",
    "we present the result below , and leave the detailed justification for the supplementary information .",
    "the complete energy cost associated to the toffoli gate reads    @xmath40      in addition to satisfying each gate separately , spins shared by neighboring tiles must be matched across the entire system in order for the tile model to accurately represent the desired computational circuit . to be precise one can imagine splitting each boundary spin into two `` twin '' spins and identifying input / output spins with each tile . within this picture ,",
    "adjacent spins at the boundary between tiles must be locked together , a constraint we implement by introducing a ferromagnetic `` grout '' coupling @xmath41 between spins on adjacent tiles . the corresponding term in the energy is then written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 labels pairs of `` twin '' spins @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the boundary between two adjacent tiles and the sum ranges over all such pairs of the system .      completing the description of the two - dimensional model of universal classical computation",
    "requires a discussion of boundary conditions , which determine the type of computational problem one is addressing .",
    "for example , if the @xmath46-bit input is fully specified and one is interested in the output , all that is needed is to transfer the information encoded into the input left to right by applying sequentially the gates one column of tiles at a time . in this case",
    ", if the depth ( i.e. , the number of steps ) of the computation is a polynomial in @xmath46 , this column - column computation reaches the output boundary , and thus solves the problem , in polynomial time .",
    "as mentioned earlier , by using reversible gates one can also represent computational problems with mixed input - output boundary conditions for which only a fraction of the bits on the left ( input ) edge and a fraction of the bits on the right ( output ) edge are fixed .",
    "a concrete example is the integer factorization problem implemented in terms of a reversible integer multiplication circuit .",
    "a reversible circuit for multiplying two @xmath46-bit numbers @xmath0 and @xmath47 can be constructed using @xmath48 bits in each column .",
    "one needs two @xmath46-bit registers for the two numbers @xmath0 and @xmath47 to be multiplied , one @xmath46-bit carry register @xmath29 for the ripple - sums , a @xmath49-bit register @xmath50 for storing the answer @xmath51 , and one ancilla bit @xmath28 . for multiplication , one",

    "thus , @xmath52 bits in the input and output are fixed , while @xmath49 bits are floating on both boundaries .",
    "boundary conditions on inputs , outputs , or both are imposed by inserting longitudinal fields at the appropriate bit sites , namely , @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the sign of an individual @xmath55 field determines the value of the spin @xmath56 and thus of the binary variable @xmath57 : for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , while for @xmath60 , @xmath61 . if no constraint is imposed on a binary variable @xmath57 , then @xmath62 .",
    "the previous section led us to a classical hamiltonian that includes the energy functions internal to each tile , the coupling between the spins at the boundary between adjacent tiles , and the magnetic fields associated with the input and output bits defining the boundary conditions of the computation , namely , @xmath63 where @xmath64 labels all the spins and @xmath65 represents the energy function of tile ( i.e. , gate ) @xmath66 .",

    "[ sec : chimera ] .",

    "this limit is best understood if we switch off the coupling between tiles , @xmath6 . within a given tile ,",

    "requires at least two spin flips , the transverse field @xmath68 induces an effective , second - order or higher spin - spin interaction on the ground state manifold of a given tile of order @xmath80 or lower .",
    "figure  [ fig : level - transition ] illustrates a second - order process .",
    "switching on the @xmath6 coupling penalizes configurations in which the states of adjacent tiles are incompatible .",
    "thus , in order to satisfy both intra- and inter - tile constrains that define the computational process we must reach the limit of @xmath81 .      to make the above discussion more concrete we derive an effective hamiltonian of a quantum vertex model which allows us to investigate both the thermodynamics and dynamics of the system , and which we believe is the most effective formal setting for future work on the class of problems introduced in this paper .",
    "for simplicity , we use rectangular tiles arranged so that all tiles have four neighbors ( they are laid on a square lattice ) .",
    "we then combine pairs of i d and swap square tiles into four types of rectangular tiles , id - id , id - swap , swap - id , and swap - swap .",

    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "we demonstrated that , in the limit of the trivial computational circuit with no toffoli gates , this transition is second order , in direct analogy to the case of the one - dimensional ising model in a transverse magnetic field .",

    "follows a physics perspective , namely it concentrates on `` typical behavior '' based on heuristic approach to explicit instantiations of the vertex model .",
    "computer science could benefit from further work on more sophisticated theoretical and computational heuristic approaches , special purpose hardware ( _ i.e. _ , quantum annealers ) , and new formal proofs that rely on statistical mechanics representations of computational problems . at the same time",
    "there are lessons to be learned from computer science that we believe may have interesting implications for physics .",
    "for example , if np@xmath191p , the vertex model representing the hardest problems in unique - sat can be also viewed as describing a physical glassy system that displays slow dynamics even though the model : ( i ) involves no frustrating interactions ; ( ii ) has a unique non - degenerate ground state ; and ( iii ) displays no bulk thermodynamic transitions down to zero temperature ! there are known examples of systems with glassy dynamics in the absence of a thermodynamic phase transition , such as the kinetically constrained models discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the non - arrhenius relaxation characteristic of these models only translate into a quasi - polynomial time - to - solution of a computational problem .",
    "thus , within the vertex model approach , the existence of hard unique - sat problems with exponential or sub - exponential behavior of the time - to - solution would suggest the existence of a novel family of glassy physical systems without a thermodynamic transition but with exponentially large barriers and corresponding astronomically - long relaxation times .",
    "this example underscores the richness of the possibilities opened by explorations of the vertex model of classical computation and more generally , of problems at the interface between physics and computer science .",

    "<S> while we show that the model displays no finite temperature phase transitions , independent of circuit , the computational complexity is encoded in the scaling of the relaxation rate into the ground state with the system size . </S>",
    "<S> the paper uses thermal annealing and a novel and more efficient heuristic `` annealing with learning '' to study various computational problems . to explore faster relaxation routes </S>",
    "<S> , we construct an explicit mapping of the vertex model into the chimera architecture of the d - wave machine , initiating a novel approach to reversible classical computation based on state - of - the - art implementations of quantum annealing . </S>"
