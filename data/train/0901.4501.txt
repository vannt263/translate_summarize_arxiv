    "the @xmath0-operations @xcite that emerges from nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite seems to provide a natural background for its mathematical formulation .",
    "the definitions of @xmath0-sum and @xmath0-product , on the realm of real numbers , @xmath1 @xmath2_+^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } ,   \\quad x>0,\\ , y>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3_+=\\max\\{p,0\\}$ ] , allow some expressions of nonextensive statistical mechanics be written with the same formal simplicity of the extensive ( @xmath4 ) formalism .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0-logarithm @xcite of a product , and the @xmath0-exponential of a sum are written as @xmath5 @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8_+^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\ ] ] the @xmath0-sum and the @xmath0-product are associative , commutative , present neutral element ( 0 for @xmath0-sum and 1 for @xmath0-product ) and opposite and inverse elements under restrictions .",
    "a reasonable question is whether those operations provide a structure of commutative ring or even field . since the @xmath0-product does not distribute over the @xmath0-sum",
    ", they do not define those algebraic structures .",
    "there are instances of other structures that are distributive , though do not present other properties . for instance , the tropical algebra @xcite  for which the @xmath9-sum of two extended real numbers ( @xmath10 ) is the minimum between them and the @xmath9-product is the usual sum  does not have reciprocal elements in relation to the @xmath9-sum .",
    "on the other hand , the relevant structure of a near - ring @xcite is an example of a non - distributive ring ; however , in this case , distributivity is required in at least one side .",
    "it is known long ago , as pointed out by green @xcite , that practical examples of ( both sides ) of non - distributive algebraic structures are not so easy to find out .",
    "so the @xmath0-algebraic structure is a good example of both - side non - distributive structure .",
    "recently , we have generalized the @xmath0-algebraic structure into a biparametrized @xmath11-algebraic structure ( and , more generally , into a @xmath12 parameter algebraic structure ) @xcite , in such a way that the two - parameter operators @xmath11-sum , @xmath11-product , and their inverses , present the same properties of the monoparameterized @xmath0-algebraic structure .",
    "a remarkable feature of these algebraic structures is that the distributivity property does not hold .",
    "though this `` non - property '' is very interesting , there are some proposals in the literature @xcite ( that will be shown later ) which change somehow the @xmath0-algebraic structure in order to recover distributivity . in all of those proposals",
    "@xcite , the operations are deformed but the numbers are not deformed . in this work , we deform the numbers to obtain the @xmath0-numbers @xmath13 for all numerical sets based on @xmath0-sum in such way that @xmath14 since the @xmath0-product is , in a sense that we will discuss later , intrinsically non - distributive , in order to obtain the distributive structure in a very natural way , we keep the @xmath0-sum and propose a new product such that @xmath15 we also set up the @xmath16-numbers and @xmath17-numbers based on other deformed sums presented in @xcite .",
    "we call the attention to the interesting connection between the @xmath0-natural number and the heine number @xcite . other mathematical objects , whose elements are @xmath0-numbers , may be generated by deformed operations ; we exemplify some @xmath0-pascal s triangles , derived by @xmath0-sum , that correspond to different patterns .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : qnumericalsets ] introduces the @xmath0-numerical sets ; sec .",
    "[ sec : newproduct ] proposes a different product @xmath18 ; other mathematical objects as @xmath0-pascal s triangles are addressed in sec.[sec : pascaltriangle ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our concluding remarks .",
    "the main idea is to use the classical construction of the numerical sets @xcite for which elements are the respective deformed numbers .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath0-natural , @xmath0-integer , @xmath0-rational and @xmath0-real numerical sets respectively .    consider an induction over an arbitrary generator @xmath23 ( that we assume different from 0 and @xmath24 to avoid trivial structures ) @xmath0-summed @xmath12 times : @xmath25^n -1]}{1-q}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for simplicity of the expressions in this note , we shall choose @xmath26 , and obtain the deformed @xmath0-natural number summed @xmath12 times : @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for the binomial coefficients .",
    "the @xmath0-neutral element is the same as the usual one , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , and also @xmath31 . of course @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence of the parameter @xmath0 provides a plethora of interesting different structures .",
    "for instance , with @xmath34 , we have a structure given by @xmath35 ; with @xmath36 , we have a structure isomorphic to the finite field with two elements @xmath37 . however , if @xmath38 , we have infinite structures whose elements are all real numbers ( if complex numbers are allowed , there is more freedom on the parameter @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that the set @xmath39 with the map @xmath40 is a model for the peano axioms .",
    "let us show , for example , some elements of the set @xmath41 for @xmath42 : @xmath43 from the set of the deformed @xmath0-natural number , we may construct , as in the classical way , by means the ( difference ) equivalence relation on @xmath44 , the set of deformed @xmath0-integer numbers @xmath45 .",
    "we also draw some elements of this set for @xmath42 : @xmath46 it is interesting to note that , in any case , the @xmath0-integer are strictly greater than @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath0-integer numbers were also studied by r. cardo and a. corvolan @xcite based on the @xmath47 operation introduced in @xcite : @xmath48 , which is defined in the same way as the notion we introduced in ( [ induction ] ) by induction .",
    "analogously , we have also constructed , as in the classical case , the deformed @xmath0-rational numbers @xmath49 , by an ( ratio ) equivalence relation on @xmath50 , and the @xmath0-real numbers , @xmath51 , by cauchy sequences .",
    "it would also be possible to construct the @xmath0-real numbers using the dedekind cuts .",
    "we have proved that , following the classical construction of the @xmath0-real number , they are given by @xmath52 the asymptotical behavior of @xmath13 ( @xmath53 ) is given by : @xmath54     @xmath0-real number @xmath13 versus @xmath55 for some typical values of @xmath0.,width=226 ]    for @xmath56 , @xmath13 may assume complex values .",
    "it is amazing to note that in the study of the @xmath0_-analogues _ of the hypergeometric series @xcite , at the second half of nineteenth century , heine introduced the deformed number @xcite @xmath57_h=\\frac{h^n-1}{h-1},\\ ] ] known as the @xmath0_-analogue _ of @xmath12 .",
    "the number deformation plays a fundamental role in combinatorics , but also have applications in the study of fractals , hyperbolic geometry , chaotic dynamical systems , quantum groups , etc .",
    "there are also many physical applications , for instance , in exact models in statistical mechanics .",
    "it is interesting that the deformed @xmath0-number ( [ qreal ] ) is exactly the heine number , by the simple change of variables @xmath58 .",
    "the connection between nonextensive statistical mechanics and the heine number ( and quantum groups ) was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the coincidence of the symbol @xmath0 in all these different contexts ( @xmath0-series , @xmath0-analogues , @xmath0uantum groups , and @xmath0-entropy ) occurs just by chance .",
    "it is possible to define other generalized numbers , based on the algebraic structures proposed on @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two operations @xmath16-sum ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) and @xmath16-product ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) were introduced .",
    "the @xmath16-sums are , respectively , @xmath63 @xmath64 } \\right\\}^{1/a}.\\ ] ] the @xmath16-products are , respectively , @xmath65 @xmath66 - 1}{a}.\\ ] ] based on ( [ niva - sum ] ) , we obtain the deformed @xmath67 number with generator @xmath23 : @xmath68^{1/a}.\\ ] ] in @xcite , two operations @xmath17-sum ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and @xmath17-product ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) were proposed .",
    "the @xmath17-sums are , respectively , @xmath73 @xmath74^k   -1}{k}.\\ ] ] the @xmath17-products , are , respectively @xmath75 @xmath76^{1/k}.\\ ] ] based on ( [ nikos0-sum ] ) and ( [ nikos - sum ] ) , the deformed numbers with generator @xmath23 , @xmath77}$ ] and @xmath78}$ ] , associated to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , are : @xmath79}=\\frac{x^k ( 1 + k \\,g ) -1}{k},\\ ] ] @xmath80}=[x \\,g^k - ( x-1)]^{1/k}.\\ ] ]",
    "the @xmath0-product is non - distributive , i.e. , @xmath81    as an essential result for our work , we observe that , assuming a set with more than one element and keeping reasonable properties such as the additive neutral element and cancellation to sum , then there is no deformed sum that is distributed by the @xmath0-product .",
    "in fact :    let @xmath82 be the neutral element of such a sum .",
    "if we impose the distributive property :    @xmath83 @xmath84 thus @xmath85 , using ( [ q - product ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 i.e. , @xmath55 has to be one of the complex roots @xmath87 ; so , restricted to real numbers , @xmath55 has to be 1 . since @xmath55 is any element , the set has just one element .",
    "therefore the non - distributivity is an intrinsic property of the @xmath0-product .",
    "some authors @xcite tried to obtain distributive structures based on @xmath0-operations .",
    "for instance , note that , although the operation @xmath62 is distributive over @xmath59 , shown in ( [ niva - sum ] ) , @xmath59 does not have neutral element , as it was consistent with the above result .",
    "moreover @xmath61 , shown in ( [ niva - prod ] ) , is distributive over @xmath60 .    concerning the @xmath17-sums and the @xmath17-products ,",
    "@xmath72 is distributive over @xmath69 , shown in ( [ nikos - sum ] ) , as well as @xmath71 , shown in ( [ nikos - prod ] ) , is distributive over @xmath69 .",
    "note that the distributivity results from the curious exchange of roles of the operations : the @xmath17-sum @xmath70 is indeed a @xmath0-product , and the @xmath17-product @xmath72 is a @xmath0-sum .    since there is no deformed sum that is distributed by the @xmath0-product",
    ", we propose a new product , signed @xmath18 , that emerges naturally from the classical construction of the numerical set , just mentioned .",
    "this new product is different from equations ( [ niva - prod ] ) and ( [ nikos - prod ] ) , and distributes over the @xmath0-sum .",
    "it is defined as @xmath88 \\ln[1+(1-q ) \\,y]}{[\\ln ( 2-q)]^2}\\}}-1}{1-q}.\\ ] ] moreover the @xmath0-sum and the @xmath0-product obey , respectively , ( [ qsumnumber ] ) and ( [ diamprodnumber ] ) . for the @xmath0-sum , we have : @xmath89[(2-q)^y-1]}{1-q }   \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   \\frac{(2-q)^{x+y } -1 } { 1-q }   =   ( x+y)_q .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath0-product , we have @xmath90 \\ln[(2-q)^y]}{[\\ln ( 2-q)^2]}\\}}-1}{1-q }   \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   \\frac{(2-q)^{x\\,y } -1 } { 1-q }   =   ( x \\ , y)_q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that , when @xmath91 , @xmath92 .    using ( [ qsum1 ] ) and ( [ qdiamond ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to prove that the @xmath18 product distributes over the @xmath0-sum when applied to @xmath0-numbers , i.e. :    @xmath93 + [ x_q \\diamond_q y_q].\\ ] ]    in other words , @xmath94_q   = [ x\\,y + x\\,z]_q   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( x\\,y)_q \\oplus_q ( x \\,z)_q \\nonumber \\\\ & = & ( x_q \\diamond_q y_q ) \\oplus_q ( x_q \\diamond_q z_q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the deformations of operations and numbers open questions about other mathematical objects derived from them .",
    "an interesting class of those objects are the pascal s triangles . recently",
    ", some works connect nonextensive statistical mechanics with leibnitz @xcite and pascal s triangles derived from the @xmath0-product @xcite .    in order to exhibit some simple applications of such deformations , in this section we construct @xmath0-pascal s triangles using @xmath0-sum as the deformed operation . in this way ,",
    "their elements are @xmath0-numbers .",
    "different patterns are illustrated for different values of @xmath0 .",

    "in this work , we explore the properties of the algebraic structure derived from the @xmath0-sum which implies a new product , in a natural way , that recovers the distributive property",
    ". it is done by constructing the @xmath0-numerical sets based on @xmath0-sum .",
    "we show that , assuming some properties , the @xmath0-product does not distribute over any sum .",
