    "in this paper we introduce and study the _ nonlocal / fractional cheeger problem _ in an open and bounded set @xmath0 . this amounts to finding a set @xmath4 such that @xmath5 here @xmath6 stands for the @xmath2dimensional lebesgue measure , @xmath7 for the _ nonlocal @xmath8-perimeter _ , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the characteristic function of a set @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath1cheeger set _ of @xmath3 is a set @xmath12 satisfying . accordingly",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is called the _ @xmath1cheeger constant _ of @xmath3 .",
    "we point out that recently the study of nonlocal geometric quantities like @xmath7 has received a great impulse , as they arise in the modelization of phase - transitions in presence of nonlocal interaction terms .",
    "we refer to the survey @xcite for an updated account on these studies .",
    ".2 cm problem turns out to have many interesting features and appears to be less obvious to understand than its local counterpart , the ( usual ) cheeger problem , where a cheeger set is a set @xmath12 achieving the infimum @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the distributional perimeter of @xmath11 , i.e. the total variation of the measure @xmath16 .",
    "problem was first introduced by jeff cheeger in @xcite in the context of riemannian geometry , see also @xcite for an overview of the problem .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath17 is indeed an optimal poincar constant , namely @xmath18 and that @xmath17 is the limit of the first eigenvalue of the @xmath19laplacian as @xmath20 goes to @xmath21 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6 ) . in the same spirit , in this paper we prove that the @xmath1cheeger constant can be equivalently characterized as the following @xmath22eigenvalue ( see theorem [ teo : primo1 ] ) @xmath23 and that @xmath24 coincides with the limit as @xmath20 goes to @xmath21 of the nonlinear and nonlocal eigenvalues @xmath25 ( see theorem [ teo : lim ] ) , coming from the eigenvalue problem @xmath26 which has been first introduced and studied by lindqvist and the second author in @xcite .",
    "we remark that both in and in the definition of the @xmath1perimeter , the integrals are taken over the whole @xmath27 and not only over @xmath3 itself .",
    "the reason is twofold : if one only integrates over @xmath3 then all sets would have @xmath1cheeger constant equal to zero ; on the other hand , the problem would not have the appropriate scaling properties .",
    "for the problem we also provide a global @xmath28 estimate for the solutions ( theorem [ lm : stimetta ] ) and a faber - krahn inequality with identification of equality cases ( theorem [ teo : fk ] ) , which were both missing in @xcite .    using a scaling argument",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath1cheeger sets must touch the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "we are able to prove that , as in the local case , this happens in a @xmath29 fashion at the points where @xmath30 is regular . moreover we show that in the interior of @xmath3 any @xmath1cheeger set is , up to a singular set of dimension @xmath31 , a @xmath32 surface having constant _ non - local mean curvature _ equal to @xmath33 , in the sense that @xmath34 for @xmath35 .    finally , we provide another alternative characterization of the @xmath1cheeger constant , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the adjoint of the following linear and continuous operator @xmath38 this is a nonlocal version of the max flow min cut theorem , which can be useful to obtain lower bounds on @xmath24 .",
    "we recall that for the local case this was investigated in @xcite , where the following characterization @xmath39 was obtained ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we are left with many open questions and problems . since",
    "the nonlocal mean curvature is a quantity that takes into account the global behavior , the property can not in general imply a local characterization of the boundary of a cheeger set . even for dimension",
    "@xmath40 we are not able to provide any finer information about the interior behaviour of @xmath1cheeger sets , apart from the @xmath29 regularity .",
    "however , we should mention that even for the usual cheeger constant @xmath17 , explicitly determining or inferring fine properties of the cheeger sets are difficult tasks .",
    "these usually become affordable for @xmath40 , when some severe geometric restrictions are imposed on @xmath3 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a deep difference between the nonlocal case and the usual one is enlightened by the following behaviour : as it is shown in remark [ oss : buchi ] , for a sequence of sets @xmath41 such that @xmath42 the @xmath1perimeter as well converges to @xmath43 .",
    "this implies for example that in general filling a hole does not decrease the @xmath1perimeter , at least if the hole is `` large enough '' , while of course this is always the case for the usual distributional perimeter .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that @xmath44 is a sort of interpolation quantity between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see corollary [ coro : relazioni ] ) .",
    "related is the question of uniqueness of @xmath1cheeger sets which also remains open . while cheeger sets are known to be unique when @xmath3 is convex ,",
    "as proved in @xcite , this is no longer clear in the nonlocal setting .",
    "we start with section [ sec : sobolev ] , where we precise the functional analytic setting of our problem and we recall some facts about fractional sobolev spaces that will be needed throughout the whole paper . then in section [ sec",
    ": first ] we recall the definition of first eigenvalue @xmath47 from @xcite and prove that the associated first eigenfunctions are bounded , together with the faber - krahn inequality .",
    "section [ sec : sperimeter ] introduces the @xmath1perimeter of a set , there we recall some connections between the naturally associated sobolev space @xmath48 and the space of @xmath49 functions .",
    "with section [ sec : constant ] we enter the core of the paper : we introduce problem and prove some first properties .",
    "the remaining sections are then devoted to study regularity issues for @xmath1cheeger sets ( section [ sec : reg ] ) , the relation between the first eigenvalues @xmath47 and the @xmath1cheeger constant ( section [ sec : lim ] ) and the alternative characterization ( section [ sec : maxmin ] ) .",
    "three appendices containing some technical results complement the paper .",
