    "enhancements of @xmath5 , i.e. , invariants which specialize to @xmath5 but are generally stronger invariants , have been studied in various papers such as @xcite .    in @xcite an associative algebra known as the _ rack algebra _ was defined from a finite rack @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "quandle algebras were used to enhance the quandle counting invariant , and later in @xcite a modified rack algebra was used to enhance the rack counting invariant . in @xcite , rack algebras were generalized to _",

    "i.e. a set with an @xmath2-action satisfying certain diagrammatically motivated properties .",
    "birack shadow algebra invariants as defined in @xcite are well defined for classical knots and links but not for virtual knots and links .",
    "in this paper we introduce _ virtual birack shadow algebras _ and _ twisted virtual birack shadow algebras_. as an application , we use modules over these algebras to enhance the virtual birack and twisted virtual birack counting invariants , and we show that the enhanced invariants can detect orientation reversal and are not determined by the knot group , the arrow or miyazawa polynomials , or the twisted jones polynomial .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ bb ]",
    "we recall the basics of virtual knots , virtual biracks and virtual birack shadows , then introduce virtual birack shadow algebras and modules and use these to define an infinite family of enhanced virtual link invariants . in section [ tvbs ]",
    "we introduce twisted virtual birack shadow algebras and modules and use these to define an infinite family of enhanced twisted virtual link invariants .",
    "we collect a few computations and examples in section [ cex ] , and we conclude in section [ q ] with a few open questions for further research .",
    "_ virtual knots and links _ were introduced in @xcite by louis kauffman in 1996 as a combinatorial generalization of classical knots and links . every oriented knot or link diagram is a planar 4-valent directed graph with crossing information at the vertices .",
    "edges in this graph are called _",
    "semiarcs_. such a graph can be encoded as a _ signed gauss code _ by naming the crossings , choosing a base point on each component , and then noting the order in which the over and under instances of each crossing are encountered when following the orientation of each component .",
    "@xmath6    a _ virtual link _ is then an equivalence class of signed gauss codes under the gauss code versions of the reidemeister moves . attempting to reconstruct the original oriented link diagram from a signed gauss code ,",
    "one quickly finds that some signed gauss codes determine nonplanar diagrams , i.e. diagrams needing extra crossings not listed in the gauss code .",
    "an equivalence class of signed gauss codes is a _ classical link _ if it contains a signed gauss code corresponding to a planar oriented link diagram .    for the nonplanar diagrams , kauffman introduced _",
    "virtual crossings _ drawn as circled self - intersections which do not appear in gauss codes along with the rule that two virtual link diagrams are equivalent if their signed gauss codes are equivalent by gauss code reidemeister moves . in terms of virtual knot diagrams ,",
    "this breaks down into the _ virtual reidemeister moves : _    @xmath7    geometrically , a virtual crossing can be understood as representing genus in the surface on which the link diagram is drawn ; thus , virtual knot theory is closely related to the theory of knots and links in @xmath8-bundles over compact surfaces @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 alternative interpretations of virtual knot diagrams exist , such as dror bar - natan s circuit board analogy in which classical crossings represent logic gates on a circuit board and virtual crossings represent the connections between the gates ( where we do nt care which wire goes over or under ) .    including virtual crossings",
    "restores the planarity of our knot diagram .",
    "the edges in a virtual knot diagram considered as a planar 4-valent graph with crossing information ( classical or virtual ) specified at each vertex will still be called _ semiarcs _ ; we also define a _ classical semiarc _ to be the result of dividing our virtual knot diagram only at classical crossing points , i.e. edges in the original nonplanar graph .",
    "a _ virtual birack _ is an algebraic structure whose axioms encode the _ blackboard framed virtual isotopy moves _ , obtained from the virtual isotopy moves by replacing the usual reidemeister type i move with the blackboard framed reidemeister type i move : @xmath10    we also have    @xmath11    [ def : lab ]    the virtual birack axioms are the result of translating the the oriented blackboard framed virtual reidemeister moves into conditions on labelings of semiarcs using the labeling rule in definition [ def : lab ] .",
    "invertibility of @xmath12 and existence , uniqueness and invertibility of @xmath3 and @xmath13 encode the reidemeister ii and vii moves ; diagonal invertibility of @xmath14 satisfies the framed i move , while the requirement that @xmath15 fixes the diagonal satisfies the vi move .",
    "the yang - baxter equations then encode the reidemeister iii , viii and v moves .",
    "indeed , by construction we have :    note that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the set of virtual birack homomorphisms from the fundamental virtual birack @xmath18 of @xmath19 to the labeling birack @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a virtual birack .",
    "the maps @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 and @xmath22 give the virtual birack labels on the semiarcs in a framed type i move : @xmath23 since @xmath24 represents going through a positive kink , @xmath24 is known as the _ kink map _ of the virtual birack @xmath2 .",
    "the order of @xmath24 , i.e. the smallest positive integer @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , is the _ birack rank _ or _",
    "birack characteristic _ of @xmath2 .",
    "virtual birack labelings of a virtual knot or link are preserved by blackboard framed virtual reidemeister moves but not in general by reidemeister i moves .",
    "however , if a virtual birack @xmath2 has finite birack rank @xmath25 , then labelings of @xmath2 are preserved by _ @xmath25-phone cord moves _ : @xmath27 in particular , if @xmath19 and @xmath28 are related by framed virtual reidemeister and @xmath25-phone cord moves , then @xmath29 .",
    "see @xcite for more .",
    "thus , if @xmath19 is an unframed oriented virtual link of @xmath30 components , there is a @xmath30-dimensional lattice of framings of @xmath19 corresponding to writhe vectors in @xmath31 , each representing a distinct framed link .",
    "we therefore have , associated to an unframed oriented virtual link , a @xmath31-lattice of basic birack counting invariants .",
    "the fact that @xmath25-phone cord moves preserve @xmath32 then implies that this lattice is tiled with repeats of a @xmath30-dimensional tile corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , the sum over one tile of the basic counting invariants yields an invariant of unframed oriented virtual links known as the _ integral virtual birack counting invariant_.    for instance , if @xmath34 then for the virtual hopf link we have @xmath35    by construction and theorem 1 , we have    [ ex1 ]      _ shadow labelings _ , that is , labelings of the regions between the arcs of a knot diagram , have been used in connection with rack , quandle , birack and biquandle counting invariants in @xcite .",
    "we now extend this idea to the case of virtual biracks .",
    "@xmath36    elements of an @xmath2-shadow @xmath3 are used to label the regions between the strands in an @xmath2-labeled virtual link diagram :    the shadow axioms are chosen to guarantee that shadow labelings are well - defined at classical and virtual crossings . it is straightforward to show that the requirement that shadow labels are well - defined around classical and virtual crossings is sufficient to guarantee that shadow labelings are preserved under reidemeister moves .",
    "moreover , well - definedness of shadow labels around positive crossings implies well - definedness around negative crossings .",
    "let @xmath38 be a virtual birack and @xmath39 an @xmath2-shadow .",
    "we can specify the shadow operation with an @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 whose row @xmath42 column @xmath43 entry is @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "note that right - invertibility of @xmath46 requires the columns of @xmath41 to be permutations , and the columns corresponding to birack elements @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the same .",
    "@xmath49    it is apparent that the number of shadow labelings for a fixed @xmath2-labeling is equal to the cardinality of @xmath3 , since a choice of shadow label for one `` source '' region determines shadow labels for all other regions , and there are @xmath50 such choices .",
    "hence , we have    let @xmath2 be a finite birack .",
    "for any @xmath2-shadow and oriented virtual link @xmath19 , we have @xmath51    let @xmath2 be a virtual birack and @xmath3 an @xmath2-shadow .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath28 are virtually isotopic virtual links , then we have @xmath52    [ ex2 ]      the virtual shadow counting invariant is an enhancement of the integral virtual birack counting invariant , but an enhancement that is equivalent to the original unenhanced invariant . to get a stronger enhancement , we need additional algebraic structure .",
    "[ def : vba ] @xmath53    the virtual birack algebra is motivated by the @xmath54-virtual birack definition ; given an @xmath1-labeled link diagram , we define a secondary labeling of the semiarcs by beads which obey @xmath54-style relations with coefficients which depend on the @xmath1 labels at the crossing .",
    "the relations are obtained from the framed virtual reidemeister moves and the @xmath25-phone cord move using the bead relations @xmath55    for instance , the virtual move viii yields the requirements @xmath56 repeating for the other framed virtual reidemeister moves yields the relations in definition [ def : vba ] .",

    "twisted virtual knots and links were introduced in @xcite in 2008 , generalizing the notion of virtual knots as knots in @xmath8-bundles over compact orientable surfaces to the case of compact nonorientable surfaces .",
    "classical crossings in a twisted virtual link diagram correspond to crossings in @xmath61 , while virtual crossings correspond to genus in @xmath61 and _ twist bars _ on strands indicate when a strand has traversed a cross - cap in @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63    a twisted oriented blackboard framed virtual link is an equivalence class of twisted oriented virtual link diagrams , i.e. oriented virtual link diagrams with twist bars , under the equivalence relation generated by the virtual reidemeister moves together with the _ twisted moves _ : @xmath64      adding twists to our set of allowed moves adds a map @xmath65 to our algebraic structure defined by semiarc labelings .",
