    "a simple generalization of a closed space curve is the notion of a ribbon .",
    "an ideal narrow ribbon in three - dimensional space is specified by the position of one edge at each point along its length , together with the unit normal vector to the ribbon at each point of this edge",
    ". if the ribbon is a closed loop ( with two faces , not one as a mbius band ) , then the two edges are non - intersecting closed curves in space which may wind around each other if the looped ribbon is twisted .",
    "such ideal twisted ribbon loops are important in applications , for instance modelling circular duplex dna molecules ( fuller 1971 , 1978 ; pohl 1980 ; bauer _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 ; hoffman _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , magnetic field lines ( moffatt & ricca 1992 ) , phase singularities ( winfree & strogatz 1983 ; dennis 2004 ) , rotating body frames ( hannay 1998 ; starostin 2002 ) , and various aspects of geometric phase theory ( chiao & wu 1986 ; kimball & frisch 2004 ) .",
    "a fundamental result in the geometry of twisted , closed ribbon loops is clugreanu s theorem ( clugreanu 1959 , 1961 ; moffatt & ricca 1992 ) ( also referred to as white s formula ( white 1969 ; pohl 1980 ; kauffman 2001 ; eggar 2000 ) , and the clugreanu - white - fuller theorem ( adams 1994 ; hoffman _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , which is expressed as @xmath0 @xmath1 is the topological linking number of the two edge curves ; it is the classical gauss linking number of topology ( described , for example , by epple ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the theorem states that this topological invariant is the sum of two other terms whose proper definitions will be given later and which individually depend on geometry rather than topology : the twist @xmath2 is a measure of how much the ribbon is twisted about its own axis , and the writhe @xmath3 is a measure of non - planarity ( and non - sphericity ) of the axis curve .",
    "the formula actually has a very simple interpretation in terms of ` views ' of the ribbon from different projection directions ( this is hinted at in the discussion of kauffman ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "such interpretations of @xmath1 and @xmath3 go back to fuller ( 1971 , 1978 ) and pohl ( 1968_a _ , _ b _ ) , but do not seem to have been extended to @xmath4 this is our first result .",
    "our second uses this picture to construct , for any curve , a particular ribbon on it which has zero @xmath5 this is the writhe framing ribbon , anticipated algebraically by j. h. maddocks ( private communication , unpublished notes ; also see hoffman _",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the topological argument can be paraphrased very simply .",
    "consider the two edges of a ribbon loop , for example that in figure [ fig : loop ] .",
    "viewing a particular projection as in the picture , there are a number of places where one edge crosses the other . a positive direction around the ribbon",
    "is assigned arbitrarily , so that the two edges can be given arrows . at each crossing between the two edge curves , a sign ( @xmath6 ) can be defined according to the the sense of rotation of the two arrows at the crossing ( @xmath7 for right handed , @xmath8 for left handed , as shown in figure [ fig : loop ] ) . summing the signs ( @xmath9 ) of the crossings",
    "gives twice the linking number @xmath1 of the ribbon edges ( the sign of @xmath1 is positive for a ribbon with planar axis and a right - handed twist , and is negative for a planar ribbon with a left - handed twist ) .",
    "since the ribbon is two - sided , the total number of crossings must be even , ensuring that @xmath1 is an integer .",
    "at the left and right sides of the figure , when the ribbon is edge - on , there are ` local crossings ' ( a ` right - handed ' or positive crossing on the right , a ` left - handed ' negative crossing on the left ) .",
    "two more positive crossings occur in the middle ( where the ribbon crosses over itself ) ; these correspond to the two crossings of the ribbon edges with themselves ( i.e. a nonlocal crossing).,width=302 ]    the crossings between the two edge curves naturally fall into two types : ` local , ' which will be associated with @xmath10 and ` nonlocal , ' which will be associated with @xmath11 local crossings are where the ribbon is edge - on to the viewing direction : one edge of the ribbon is crossing its own other edge .",
    "if the ribbon is arbitrarily narrow , then the two edges are indefinitely close in space as they cross in the projection .",
    "nonlocal type crossings between the two edges are caused by the ribbon crossing over itself .",
    "more precisely , they occur when a single edge curve of the ribbon crosses over itself .",
    "this does not itself count towards the linking number , but such a crossing implies that there are two crossings with the other edge close by , as in the centre of figure [ fig : loop ] .",
    "these two counts , the signed local crossings and signed nonlocal crossings ( which come in pairs as described ) add up to twice @xmath1 by definition . these quantities are integers , but depend on the choice of projection direction ( although their sum does not ) .",
    "it is well known ( fuller 1971 , 1978 ; adams 1994 ; kauffman 2001 ) that the number of self - crossings of the ribbon axis curve , signed appropriately , and averaged democratically over the sphere of all projection directions , equals the writhe .",
    "therefore , the signed sum of nonlocal crossings between opposite edges is twice the writhe .",
    "we claim that the local crossing counterpart ( that is , the average over all projection directions of the signed local crossing number ) is twice @xmath4 the clugreanu theorem then follows automatically .",
    "this is described in the following section .",
    "section [ sec : formalism ] is a review of standard material formalising the notions of linking and writhe ; this is used in section [ sec : writhe ] to construct the natural writhe framing of any closed curve .",
    "the interpretation of twist and writhe in terms of local and nonlocal crossings gives insight into a common application of the theorem , namely ` supercoiling ' of elastic ribbons ( such as dna , or telephone cords ; see , for example , adams ( 1994 ) , pohl ( 1980 ) , bauer _ et al . _ ( 1980 ) and hoffman _ et al . _",
    ". repeated local crossings ( i.e. a high twist ) are energetically unfavourable , whereas nonlocal crossings ( represented by writhe ) , where the ribbon repeatedly passes over itself ( ` supercoiling ' ) , are preferred elastically .",
    "in order to describe the argument more formally , it is necessary to introduce some notation .",
    "we will represent the edges of the narrow ribbon by two closed curves , @xmath12 and @xmath13 whose points are @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( and where no confusion will ensue , just @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xmath16 is an arbitrary parameterization ( giving the sense of direction along the curves ) , and @xmath17 is denoted @xmath18 @xmath12 will be referred to as the _ axis curve _ and will play the primary role of the two curves .",
    "its unit tangent @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 the other curve @xmath21 will be regarded as derived from @xmath12 via a _ framing _ of @xmath22 by associating at each point @xmath14 a unit vector @xmath23 perpendicular to the tangent ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "then we define @xmath25 for @xmath26 arbitrarily small , ensuring that the ribbon nowhere intersects itself .",
    "@xmath2 may now be defined formally , as the integral around the curve @xmath12 of the rate of rotation of @xmath27 about @xmath28 @xmath29 ( we adopt the convention of writing the integrand at the end of an integration throughout . ) @xmath2 is local in the sense that it is an integral of quantities defined only by @xmath16 on the curve , and clearly depends on the choice of framing ( ribbon ) .",
    "a simple example of a framing is the _ frenet framing _",
    ", where @xmath23 is the direction of the normal vector @xmath30 to the curve ( where defined ) .",
    "this framing plays no special role in the following .    as described in the introduction , the crossings in any projection direction",
    "can be determined to be either nonlocal ( associated with writhe ) or local .",
    "choosing an observation direction @xmath31 there is a local crossing at @xmath14 ( the ribbon appears edge - on ) , when @xmath32 is linearly dependent on @xmath19 and @xmath33 i.e. there exists some @xmath34 between 0 and @xmath35 such that @xmath36 we therefore define the vector @xmath37 dependent on parameters @xmath38 labelling a point of @xmath22 and angle @xmath34 with @xmath39    we claim that twice @xmath2 is the average , over all projection directions @xmath31 of the local crossing number .",
    "for each @xmath31 the local crossing number is defined as the number of coincidences of @xmath40 with @xmath32 or @xmath41 @xmath2 itself ( rather than its double ) can therefore be determined by just counting coincidences of @xmath40 with @xmath32 ( not @xmath42 ) .",
    "the sign of the crossing is determined by which way the tangent plane of the ribbon at @xmath16 sweeps across @xmath32 as @xmath16 passes through the edge - on position ( which side of the ribbon is visible before the crossing and which after ) .",
    "thus the vector ( @xmath43 ) is either parallel or antiparallel to @xmath44 and this decides the crossing sign : i.e. the sign of @xmath45 is minus the sign of the crossing .",
    "this sign is opposite to the usual crossing number ( described , for instance , in the next section ) , because @xmath34 increases in the opposite direction to @xmath16 along the ribbon .",
    "the average over all projection directions @xmath32 can be replaced by an integral over @xmath16 and @xmath46 since the only projection directions which count are those for which there exist @xmath47 such that @xmath48 this transformation of variables gives rise to a jacobian factor of @xmath49 ( the modulus of the quantity whose sign gives the crossing sign ) .",
    "our claim ( justified in the following ) , that @xmath2 is the spherical average of crossing numbers , is therefore @xmath50    the two expressions for twist , equations ( [ eq : twdef ] ) and ( [ eq : twdef1 ] ) , are equal ; this can be seen by integrating @xmath34 in equation ( [ eq : twdef1 ] ) , @xmath51 which is the integrand of equation ( [ eq : twdef ] ) .",
    "thus the two expressions for twist , the conventional one ( equation ( [ eq : twdef ] ) ) and the local crossing count averaged over viewing directions ( equation ( [ eq : twdef1 ] ) ) , are the same .",
    "the preceding analysis of @xmath2 is reminiscent of the more abstract analysis of pohl ( 1980 ) , albeit with a different interpretation .    using the notion of direction - averaged crossing numbers",
    ", the clugreanu theorem follows immediately , as we now explain . for a sufficiently narrow ribbon ,",
    "it is straightforward to decompose the crossings between different edges into local and nonlocal for each projection of the ribbon .",
    "it is well known ( fuller ( 1971 , 1978 ) , adams ( 1994 ) ) that writhe @xmath3 equals the sum of signed nonlocal crossings , averaged over direction , i.e. twice the average of self - crossings of the axis curve with itself ( a proof is provided in the next section ) .",
    "the average of local crossings ( between different edges , counting with respect to both @xmath32 and @xmath42 ) , has been shown to equal twice the twist @xmath2 defined in equation ( [ eq : twdef ] ) .",
    "the sum of local plus nonlocal crossings is independent of the choice of projection direction , and is twice the linking number @xmath1 of the two curves .",
    "so , averaging the crossings over the direction sphere , @xmath52    any ambiguity as to whether a crossing is local or nonlocal arises only when the projection direction @xmath53 coincides with the ( positive or negative ) tangent @xmath54 however , the set of such projection directions is only one - dimensional ( parameterised by @xmath16 ) , and so does not contribute ( has zero measure ) to the total two - dimensional average over the direction sphere .",
    "we include the present section , which reviews known material ( e.g. fuller 1971 , 1978 ; adams 1994 ; kauffman 2001 ; hannay 1998 ) , to provide some formal geometrical tools for the next section , as well as providing further insight into the proof from the previous section .",
    "the linking number @xmath1 between the curves @xmath12 and @xmath21 is related to the system of ( normalised ) _ cross chords _",
    "@xmath55 @xmath1 is represented mathematically using gauss s formula : @xmath56 this bears some similarity to the formula for twist in equation ( [ eq : twdef ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 is invariant with respect to reparameterization of @xmath16 and @xmath57 and , of course , any topological deformation avoiding intersections .",
    "the domain of integration in equation ( [ eq : lk ] ) , @xmath58 is the cross chord manifold ( secant manifold ) of pairs of points on the two curves , topologically equivalent to the torus .",
    "the mapping @xmath59 takes this torus smoothly to the sphere of directions , with the torus ` wrapping around ' the sphere an integer number of times ( the integer arises since the cross chord manifold has no boundary , and the mapping is smooth ) ; the wrapping is a two - dimensional generalization of the familiar ` winding number ' of a circle around a circle .",
    "this wrapping integer , the integral in equation ( [ eq : lk ] ) , is the linking number of the two curves ( it is the degree of the mapping ; see , for example , madsen & tornhave ( 1997 ) , epple ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see that this interpretation of @xmath1 agrees with that defined earlier in terms of crossings .",
    "choosing the observation direction @xmath31 the crossings in the projection are precisely those chords @xmath60 coinciding with @xmath32 where the sign of the scalar triple product @xmath61 gives the sign of the crossing . as with @xmath10 a crossing",
    "is only counted in the integral when @xmath60 is parallel to @xmath32 ( not antiparallel ) .",
    "since the cross chord manifold is closed ( has no boundary ) , the total sum of signed crossings does not depend on the choice of @xmath62     the points on the curve are represented by different colours on the colour wheel .",
    "b ) the writhe mesh for the curve in a ) .",
    "the black lines are the tangent curves @xmath63 and the coloured lines are the chord fans @xmath64 whose colours correspond to the points @xmath16 on the curve in a ) .",
    "note that the total writhe in this example is less than @xmath65 ( i.e. the writhe mesh does not completely cover the direction sphere).,width=415 ]    writhe has a similar interpretation to link .",
    "we define the chords between points of the same curve @xmath22 @xmath66 noting that , as @xmath67 from above , @xmath68 and as @xmath67 from below , @xmath69 the writhe is the total area on the direction sphere traversed by the vector as @xmath16 and @xmath70 are varied ; this two - dimensional surface embedded on the sphere will be referred to as the _ writhe mesh _ : @xmath71 the interpretation of crossings applies to the integral for writhe as well as link and twist ; however , for writhe , the visual crossings are uniquely associated with a chord ( the chord from @xmath16 to @xmath57 and its reverse , each have separate associated viewing directions ) .",
    "thus , for writhe , each crossing is counted exactly once , and the average over projections is not divided by 2 ( unlike link and twist ) .",
    "( however , as shown in figure [ fig : loop ] , at every nonlocal crossing of curve @xmath12 with itself , there are two crossings ( of the same sign ) with the other curve . )    unlike the cross chord manifold @xmath72 the writhe mesh @xmath73 has a boundary : it is topologically equivalent to an annulus ( i.e. a disk with a hole ) .",
    "the two boundary circles map to the tangent indicatrix curves ( i.e. the loops @xmath74 on the direction sphere , as @xmath16 varies ) . for each @xmath38",
    "the following locus on the sphere , referred to as the _ chord fan _ @xmath75 follows the directions of all the chords to the point @xmath38 starting in the positive tangent direction @xmath76 and ending at its antipodal point @xmath77 topologically , it is a ` radial ' line joining the two edges of the writhe mesh annulus , although on the direction sphere it may have self - intersections .",
    "in addition to the partial covering bounded by the tangent indicatrix curves @xmath78 the total writhe mesh may cover the direction sphere an integer number of times .",
    "the signed number of crossings , as a function of viewing direction @xmath31 changes ( by @xmath79 ) when @xmath32 crosses @xmath80 the writhe integral ( equation ( [ eq : wr ] ) ) is its average value over all viewing directions .",
    "the writhe mesh construction is illustrated in figure [ fig : writhe ] .",
    "the approach of section [ sec : proof ] may also naturally be interpreted topologically on the direction sphere .",
    "the vector @xmath81 dependent on two parameters , also defines a mesh on the direction sphere , the _ twist mesh_. for fixed @xmath38 the locus of points on the twist mesh is a semicircle , @xmath82 whose endpoints are at @xmath83 and whose midpoint is the framing vector @xmath84 as @xmath16 varies around the curve , the semicircle @xmath85 sweeps out the solid angle @xmath4 like the writhe mesh , the twist mesh is topologically an annulus , with @xmath85 the ` radial ' line labelled by @xmath86 its boundary is again the set of tangent directions @xmath80 therefore , a topological visualization of @xmath87 is the union of the meshes for twist and writhe ; each mesh has the same boundary , so the closure of the union is the join of two annuli along their boundary , topologically a torus .",
    "this torus therefore wraps around the sphere the same number of times ( has the same degree ) as the cross chord manifold @xmath88    it is therefore possible to interpret the loop @xmath89 on the manifold of cross chords @xmath90 labelled by @xmath16 on @xmath12 ( varying @xmath70 on @xmath21 ) , in terms of the twist semicircle @xmath85 and the chord fan @xmath91 the loop @xmath92 mapped to the direction sphere , is the set of cross chords directions between fixed @xmath14 and all @xmath93 on @xmath94 when the ribbon is vanishingly thin , for @xmath70 outside the neighbourhood of @xmath38 the chords @xmath60 can be approximated by the chords of @xmath95 when @xmath70 is in the neighbourhood of @xmath38 @xmath60 is approximated by @xmath96 for some @xmath34 ( exact at @xmath97 when @xmath98 ) . as @xmath99",
    "these approximations improve , and @xmath89 approaches the union of @xmath100 and @xmath101 link is therefore the area on the direction sphere swept out by the loop union of @xmath100 and @xmath85 for @xmath16 varying around the curve ; since this family of loops generates the closed torus , the direction sphere is enveloped an integer number of times .",
    "thus , clugreanu s theorem may be interpreted as a natural decomposition of the integrand in gauss s formula ( [ eq : lk ] ) in terms of the writhe mesh and twist mesh .",
    "this is very close , in a different language , to white s proof ( white 1969 , also see pohl 1968_a _ , and particularly pohl 1980 ) , where objects analogous to the writhe mesh and the twist mesh appears as boundaries to a suitably regularised ( blown - up ) 3-manifold of chords from @xmath12 to points on surface of the ribbon with boundary @xmath102",
    "in this section , we use the description of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to define , for any non - self - intersecting closed curve in space , a natural framing ( i.e. ribbon ) whose linking number is zero .",
    "such a framing is useful since it can be used as a reference to determine the linking number for any other framing : if @xmath103 represents this zero framing , and @xmath23 any other framing with linking number @xmath104 then @xmath105 clearly the twist of a zero framing is equal to minus the writhe by clugreanu s theorem , and therefore we will refer to our natural framing as the _ writhe framing_. expressing @xmath1 in terms of an integral involving the difference between two framings is reminiscent of clugreanu s original proof ( clugreanu 1959 , 1961 ; also see moffatt & ricca 1992 ) , in which the twist is defined as the total number of turns the framing vector makes with respect to the frenet framing around the curve ( provided the normal to the curve is everywhere defined ) .",
    "the total twist is therefore the sum of this with the integrated torsion around the curve ( i.e. @xmath2 of the frenet framing ) . as stated before , the frenet framing plays no role in our construction .",
    "it is easy to construct an unnatural zero framing by taking any framing , cutting anywhere , and rejoining with a compensating number of twists locally .",
    "in contrast , the framing we construct here is natural in the canonical sense that , at any point @xmath38 the definition of @xmath103 and its corresponding semicircle @xmath85 ( defined in equation ( [ eq : ssetdef ] ) ) depends only on the view from @xmath16 of the rest of the closed curve , that is on the chord fan @xmath100 ( defined in equation ( [ eq : csetdef ] ) ) .",
    "the rate of rotation of the resulting @xmath106 exactly compensates the corresponding writhe integrand , that is , the integrands ( with respect to @xmath16 ) of equation ( [ eq : wr ] ) and the twist of the writhe framing ( equation ( [ eq : twdef ] ) ) are equal and opposite .    .",
    "a ) the chord fan for @xmath107 is represented in red , the semicicle which bisects its area represented in pink .",
    "the tangent curves are also represented .",
    "b ) the same as part a ) , and in addition the chord fan with @xmath108 is shown in dark blue , and its bisecting semicircle in light blue .",
    "no area is swept out by these closed curves as @xmath16 evolves.,width=459 ]    this may be interpreted topologically as follows .",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath85 correspond topologically to ` radial ' lines of their respective annular meshes ; their union is a closed loop on the direction sphere .",
    "the sum of the twist and writhe integrands , by the discussion in section [ sec : proof ] , is the area swept out by this changing closed loop as @xmath16 develops ; it was proved that the total area swept out by this loop is @xmath109 the writhe framing construction of @xmath106 below arranges that the loop has a constant area ( say zero ) , and therefore the rate of area swept by this loop is zero as @xmath16 evolves , giving zero total area swept ( which is @xmath110 ) .",
    "the direction of @xmath103 for the writhe framing is that for which the semicircle @xmath85 bisects the chord fan @xmath100 in the following sense .",
    "since @xmath100 is a curve on the direction sphere with endpoints @xmath78 it may be closed by an arbitrary semicircle with the same endpoints ( i.e. any rotation of @xmath85 about @xmath83 ) .",
    "the total closed curve encloses some area on the sphere ( mod 4@xmath35 ) ; the ( unique ) semicircle which gives zero area ( mod @xmath65 ) defines @xmath111 since the spherical area enclosed by this closed curve is contant , the curve does not sweep out any area as it evolves ( since as much leaves as enters ) .",
    "an example of the writhe framing is represented in figure [ fig : framing ] .",
    "the rate of area swept out by this curve is the integrand with respect to @xmath16 in the @xmath1 expression ( equation ( [ eq : lk ] ) ) , ( i.e. the sum of the @xmath112 integrands ) .",
    "since it has been shown that this is zero , the writhe framing @xmath106 indeed has zero linking number . of course ,",
    "although the choice of zero area is most natural , the writhe faming vector @xmath106 could be defined such that the area between the chord fan @xmath100 and the twist semicircle @xmath85 is any fixed value - the important feature in the construction is that the area does not change with @xmath113    we are grateful to john maddocks for originally pointing out to us the problem of the writhe framing , and useful correspondence .",
