    "musical intervals between two tones are perceived as harmonic if the corresponding frequencies are related by simple fractional ratios  @xcite .",
    "for example , the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth corresponds to the frequency ratios @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our ability to hear and identify such fractional frequency ratios is related to the fact that the natural spectrum of musical sounds consists not only of the fundamental frequency  @xmath3 but also involves a large number higher _ partials _ ( overtones ) at integer multiple frequencies @xmath4 .",
    "our sense of hearing is capable to detect matching partials , signaling us the impression of consonance and harmony . in other words , perceiving a perfect fifth as consonant does not mean that our ears like the numerical value @xmath1 , it rather reflects the circumstance that the third partial of the lower tone coincides with the second of the upper ( see fig .",
    "[ loglin ] ) .",
    "a musical scale is a periodic system of notes ordered by increasing fundamental frequency .",
    "the western _ chromatic scale _ , on which we will focus in the present work , consists of twelve semitones per octave . as a musical scale",
    "is constructed in repeating patterns of intervals , it is always exponentially organized in the frequencies .",
    "for example , in the chromatic scale the frequency doubles from octave to octave . aiming for a harmonic perception ,",
    "musical scales are tuned in such a way that the fundamental frequencies capture or at least approximate simple fractional frequency ratios .",
    "however , in setting up such a tuning scheme one is immediately confronted with the problem that the exponential structure of the scale and the linear organization of the partials are incommensurable .",
    "the probably most natural example of such a tuning system is the _ just intonation _ , where all intervals are built on simple fractional ratios with respect to a certain reference key .",
    "music played in this reference key sounds very harmonic if not even sterile , but when played in a different key the same piece can be terribly out of tune . with the increasing complexity of music ,",
    "however , frequent key changes became more important .",
    "historically this led to the fascinating development of so - called _ temperaments _",
    "@xcite , i.e. tuning systems seeking for a reasonable compromise between harmonicity and invariance under transposition , attempting to reconcile the exponential structure of the scale with the linear organization of the partials .",
    "this development culminated in the so - called _ equal temperament _",
    "( et ) with a constant semitone ratio of @xmath0 .",
    "this temperament is perfectly invariant under key changes , but except for the octave all intervals are out of perfect tune .",
    "the et is the standard temperament of western music and has been in use since the beginning of the century .    despite the high degree of symmetry , some musicians continue to express their concern about certain intervals in the et which exhibit unpleasant beats .",
    "this discontent may have contributed to the revival of historical temperaments , accompanied by a subculture of newly invented unequal temperaments , but with all these approaches the main achievement of the et , namely its beautiful key invariance , is lost .",
    "is it possible to improve the chromatic et without destroying its symmetry under key changes ? as we will see in the present work , this is indeed possible . to understand the basic idea",
    "let us recall that the standard et is determined by three conditions , namely , ( i ) its exponential structure of constant semitone intervals , ( ii ) twelve semitones per octave , and ( iii ) the obvious condition that the frequency should double on each octave .",
    "this means that the octave , the simplest and most fundamental of all intervals , is the only pure one in the et , producing a static sound without any beats .",
    "as we are ready to tolerate beats for any other interval , why not for octaves ? by allowing the octave to exhibit beats , would it be possible to arrive at a more balanced temperament ?    in the past few decades",
    "there have been several proposals to study _ stretched equal temperaments_. in these temperaments the semitone frequency ratio is still constant but slightly larger than @xmath0 . to my knowledge",
    "the first example of this kind was the stopper@xmath5  tuning scheme introduced by b. stopper in 1988 , which favors a pure duodecime consisting of 19 semitones instead of the octave  @xcite . in 1995",
    "a similar suggestion based on a perfect fifth was put forward by s.  cordier and k. gillessen  @xcite , who argued that in practice such temperaments would be already in use .",
    "more recently a. capurso suggested what is known as the _ circular harmonic system _",
    "( c.ha.s@xmath5 )  @xcite , where all intervals exhibit beats .",
    "all these proposed chromatic temperaments belong to the same family in so far as they are perfectly equal , differing only in their semitone frequency ratio .",
    "however , while stopper and cordier simply replace the constraint of one pure interval by another , the c.ha.s temperament is based on a more complex reasoning and seeks for an optimal balance in a regime where none of the intervals is pure .    which of these temperaments establishes the best harmonic compromise ?",
    "in this paper we would like to address this question quantitatively .",
    "to this end we apply the concept of _ entropy _ as a measure for the harmonicity of a temperament . in statistical physics and information theory , entropy is known to quantify the degree of disorder in a data set . in ref .",
    "@xcite we observed that the entropy of pure ( harmonic ) intervals is locally minimal since the entropy decreases when higher partials overlap .",
    "this suggests that the entropy of overlaid power spectra can be used as a measure of harmonicity .",
    "very recently we were able to demonstrate that this concept can even be used for piano tuning  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the obvious question would be what entropy can tell us about different stretched equal temperaments .    in order to address this question ,",
    "we generate artificial harmonic power spectra for various temperaments and compute the corresponding entropy numerically .",
    "as we will see below , our results confirm that the standard equal temperament has to be replaced by a stretched one and also suggests a range for the possible optimum .",
    "it is very important to realize that stretched temperaments must not be confused with the concept of `` stretched tuning '' in the context of piano tuning which is a completely different story . in pianos , the stiffness of strings causes a deformation of the harmonic spectrum , known as inharmonicity , which is compensated in the tuning process by imposing a stretched tuning curve .",
    "contrarily , in the present work we discuss an _ intrinsic _ stretch of the temperament itself on the basis of perfectly harmonic sounds ( ih=0 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section various definitions and notations are introduced .",
    "the third section discusses the existing stretched ets in more detail . after reviewing the concept of entropy in sect .",
    "4 , the model for generating harmonic power spectra is introduced in sect .",
    "finally , the numerical results are presented in sect .",
    "6 , followed by a simple visual interpretation of the results .",
    "tones generated by musical instruments are composed of many fourier components , called _",
    "partials_. the partials are enumerated by an index @xmath6 with associated frequencies @xmath7 in ascending order , where the lowest frequency @xmath3 is referred to as the _ fundamental frequency _ of the tone .",
    "the power spectral density of a tone is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fourier transform of the sound wave @xmath10 . in the power spectrum",
    "the partials appear as peaks whose area @xmath11 is the power of the @xmath12 partial .",
    "the total power is then given by @xmath13 typically the power of the @xmath14 peak @xmath11 varies with increasing @xmath15 and eventually goes to zero so that the number of partials contributing to the sound is essentially finite  @xcite .    as in the heisenberg energy - time uncertainty relation ,",
    "the width of the peaks is inversely proportional to the temporal duration of the sound . in the limit of an infinitely long - lasting tone one obtains an idealized spectrum with infinitely sharp peaks of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the dirac delta function .",
    "a tone is called _ perfectly harmonic _ if the frequencies of the partials are exactly given by integer multiples of the fundamental frequency : @xmath18 this means that perfectly harmonic sound are exactly periodic in the fundamental frequency @xmath3 , causing a clean and static sound .",
    "the linear law ( [ linearlaw ] ) holds only for ideal oscillators such as infinitely flexible strings .",
    "realistic oscillators in musical instruments such as piano strings are of course not perfectly harmonic . in the present work , however , we will neglect this instrument - dependent imperfectness , restricting ourselves to the ideal case of perfectly harmonic spectra of the form ( [ linearlaw ] ) .    an interval between two fundamental frequencies",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath19 is called _ pure _ if some of the corresponding higher partials coincide , meaning that there exist integers @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . in the case of ideal harmonic oscillators",
    "the fundamental frequencies of a pure interval are therefore related by a rational number : @xmath22 since these coincidences appear periodically in frequency space , the perception of harmonicity is particularly intense if @xmath15 and @xmath23 are small .",
    "examples are the pure octave ( 2:1 ) , the perfect fifth ( 3:2 ) , and the perfect fourth ( 4:3 ) .",
    "let us consider a chromatic scale of @xmath24 semitones with the fundamental frequencies @xmath25 enumerated by @xmath26 .",
    "the set of all frequencies @xmath27 with respect to a reference tone ( usually a4 = 440 hz ) is referred to as the _ temperament _ of the musical scale .",
    "a temperament is called _ equal _ if the frequency ratios of all intervals are invariant under transposition ( translational shifts along the keyboard ) , i.e. , @xmath28 obviously this requires all semitone intervals @xmath29 to be constant .",
    "the standard twelve - tone _ equal temperament _ ( et ) , which was originally invented in ancient china  @xcite and rediscovered in europe in the th century , is determined by two additional conditions .",
    "firstly the octave is divided into twelve semitones .",
    "secondly the octave , the most fundamental of all intervals , is postulated to be pure ( beatless ) , as described by the frequency ratio 2:1 .",
    "these two conditions unambiguously imply that the constant semitone frequency ratio is given by @xmath30 . defining a reference tone with the index @xmath31 , for example a4 with the frequency @xmath32 hz , the standard et",
    "is therefore defined by @xmath33      since intervals are defined by frequency _",
    "ratios _ rather than differences , they give rise to a multiplicative structure in the frequency space .",
    "it is therefore meaningful and convenient to consider the logarithm of the frequencies , mapping it to an additive structure . in music theory",
    "this is done by defining the so - called _ pitch _",
    "@xmath34 with respect to a given reference frequency @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the logarithm to base 2 . with this definition",
    "it is possible to translate frequency ratios into pitch differences . in music theory",
    "such pitch differences are usually measured in _ cents _ ( @xmath37 ) , defined as 1/100 of a semitone in the standard et .",
    "therefore , in terms of pitch variables the et is simply given as @xmath38 with pitches it is possible to specify interval sizes conveniently in cents .",
    "for example , the perfect fifth has a size of @xmath39 , which is slightly larger than the fifth in the standard et with a size of exactly @xmath40 .",
    "when going from frequencies to pitches , the power spectral density @xmath41 has to be recast as a spectral density @xmath42 in terms of the pitch variable by means of the transformation @xmath43 if we apply this transformation to the idealized peaked spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ deltaspectrum ] ) we find that formally the same expression holds for the pitch variables as well , namely @xmath44",
    "in what follows we consider equal chromatic temperaments of the form @xmath45 where the semitone ratio @xmath46 is constant but slightly different from @xmath0 , meaning that the semitone interval size deviates marginally from @xmath47 .",
    "this deviation , measured in units of cents , will be denoted by @xmath48 , i.e. , we consider equal temperaments with the semitone pitch difference @xmath49 the corresponding frequencies and pitches of these modified temperaments are given by @xmath50 @xmath51 here @xmath48 is a free parameter which quantifies the stretch or quench of the temperament relative to the standard et .",
    "as we will see , the stretch parameter @xmath48 is of the order of a few hundredths cents .",
    "therefore , as a convenient notation for what follows , we shall denote by et@xmath52 a stretched equal temperament with a semitone stretch of @xmath53 .",
    "for example , et@xmath54 is just the standard equal temperament while et@xmath55 would denote a stretched equal temperament with @xmath56 or 50 millicents .",
    "since stretch differences of less than a millicent would not be audible , the resolution in terms of millicents is more than sufficient .",
    "the * stopper@xmath5 equal temperament *  @xcite replaces the constraint of pure octaves by pure duodecimes , meaning that @xmath57 .",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath58 the stretch of the * cordier equal temperament *  @xcite , which postulates perfect fifths , is even higher , namely @xmath59 finally , in the * c.ha.s@xmath5 equal temperament * the semitone ratio is defined by the implicit equation  @xcite @xmath60 with two construction - specific parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where the special case of c.ha.s corresponds to setting @xmath63 . solving this equation",
    "one obtains @xmath64 , corresponding to the stretch parameter @xmath65 all these temperaments , which are summarized in table [ tableet ] , are strictly equal in the sense that the semitone frequency ratio is constant .",
    "they belong to a whole continuum of possible stretched twelve - tone equal temperaments labeled by the parameter @xmath48 ."
