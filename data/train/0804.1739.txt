    "first , let us examine the fermi surfaces of the iron - based superconductor . for concreteness , we will consider the laofeas sample .",
    "we will assume that the properties of the sample are mainly determined by the fe - as planes .",
    "the fe atoms in a fe - as plane form a 2d square lattice ( see fig . [ ucello ] ) . due to the buckling of the as atoms ,",
    "the real unit cell contains two fe atoms .",
    "the real unit cell is also a square ( see fig . [ ucello ] ) . according to band structure calculattions ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of the fe @xmath0-bands are formed by two hole pockets at the @xmath16 point and two electron pocket at the @xmath17 point ( see fig .",
    "[ fs]a).@xcite all those pockets , mainly formed by the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals of fe,@xcite have similar size , shape , and fermi velocity .    to understand the mixing of the orbitals near those fermi pockets , we follow ref . to unfold the band structure to the extended brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "ordinarily , such an unfolding of the band structure extends the bz superficially and there are certain ambiguities in assigning the location of each band .",
    "we emphasize that this is not the case here .",
    "the band structure of the extended bz is uniquely defined due to an additional symmetry , _ i.e. _ the fe - as plane is invariant under @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the translation in the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) direction by the fe - fe distance and @xmath24 is the reflection @xmath25 ( see fig .

    "thus , if we combine the translation and the reflection @xmath24 , then the electron hopping hamiltonian @xmath26 has a symmetry described by a reduced unit cell with only one fe per unit cell ( see fig . [ ucello ] ) . since @xmath27=[p_zt_y , h]=[p_zt_x ,",

    "[ ucello]b ) .",
    "these orbitals can admix only because of the asymmetry introduced by the as ions , which has @xmath69 symmetry .",
    "this implies that the @xmath8-@xmath10 overlap integral is odd under @xmath70 and vanishes .",

    "now we can see how the 3-orbital model can reproduce the four - pocket fermi surface .",
    "let us begin by assuming that @xmath61 lies just below the fermi energy ( -0.2ev ) at @xmath78 and disperses rapidly upward to wards @xmath66 , reaching 2.5ev . from @xmath12",

    "we also find two concentric small hole pockets at @xmath12 which become the well known hole pockets at @xmath16 after folding .     and",
    "the bands near @xmath68 come from the @xmath8 and @xmath10 orbitals .",

    "the @xmath10 band @xmath63 is assumed to be at @xmath85ev at @xmath86 and @xmath78 , and disperses rapid upwards toward @xmath12 but rather flat towards @xmath66 .",
    "the fermi surface is sketched in fig .",
    "now we turn on @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this gives the electron pockets centered at @xmath67 and @xmath68 which become the two electron pockets at @xmath17 after the folding .",
    "note that because @xmath89 at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the band at @xmath68 ( or @xmath67 ) is purely @xmath82 ( or @xmath90 ) .",
    "furthermore , near @xmath68 , @xmath91 . thus along @xmath68-@xmath12 , the hybridization is zero and the @xmath8 and @xmath10 bands cross as shown in fig .",

    "however , within the 3-orbital model , it is impossible remove the fermi surface surrounding @xmath66 ( the gold solid loop in fig .",
    "[ bzo]d ) , because the hybridization elements are all zero at @xmath66 .",
    "we need a 4th band which crosses and hybridize with the @xmath92 band to eliminate the unwanted fermi surface . apart from this",
    ", the 4th band plays no role as far as the remaining two electron and two hole pockets are concerned .",
    "it is in this sense that we maintain that the 3-orbital model gives an adequate description of the low energy hamiltonian .",
    "next , let us consider the single ion interaction between the electrons on the fe @xmath0-orbitals which is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 label the orbitals , @xmath95 is the wave function of the orbitals , and @xmath96 is the electron operator for the @xmath97-orbital . due to the symmetry of the orbitals , @xmath98 must appear in pairs and the above can be rewritten as @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101,@xcite and @xmath102 here the @xmath103 term represents the coulomb interaction between electrons on same orbital .",
