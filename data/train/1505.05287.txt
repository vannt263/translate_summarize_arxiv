    "biopolymers have flexible structures and show variable functions . these functions are derived not only from the structure but also from the dynamics of the structural fluctuations themselves . therefore , identifying the dynamic properties of the structural fluctuations of biopolymers is important for understanding the interrelationship between their movements and functions .",
    "classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation is a popular and powerful method for describing the structure , dynamics , and function of biomolecules in microscopic detail .",
    "recent technological advances have allowed for simulations to be carried out on the timescales of the order of milliseconds ( see reviews by refs .  ) .",
    "as longer and larger md simulations are now being performed , it has become more important to develop methods for extracting the most `` essential '' modes from the trajectory @xcite .",
    "indeed , the development of a method to reduce the huge number of degrees of freedom of coordinates to a few collective degrees of freedom is an active field of theoretical research .    principal component analysis ( pca ) ,",
    "also called quasi - harmonic analysis or the essential dynamics method @xcite , is one of the most popular methods for analyzing the static properties of the fluctuations of structures .",
    "a system s fluctuations can be described in terms of only a few principal components ( pcs ) . moreover ,",
    "this method has been widely used to extract the few important collective modes of a biomolecule , which may serve as relevant coordinates of the free - energy surface . however ,",
    "if the simulation involves large conformational changes such as folding / unfolding simulations , and the conformational changes between local minimum - energy states are small compared with those between the folded and unfolded states , it is difficult for pca to extract the effective modes or order parameters to identify the local minimum - energy states .",
    "the root mean square distance ( rmsd ) from a reference structure , the radius of gyration , or selected distances , among others , are often used as order parameters to construct free - energy surfaces and analyze the structures obtained from a simulation .",
    "the selection of these order parameters depends on the simulation system . to identify the local minimum - energy states from the simulation , suitable order parameters",
    "must be considered , which depend on the simulation system .",
    "therefore , given the recent possibility for performing longer md simulations , a new analysis method must be able to extract suitable order parameters for identifying local minimum - energy states automatically , and for investigating the dynamics and kinetics of proteins .",
    "relaxation mode analysis ( rma ) was developed to investigate the `` dynamic '' properties of spin systems@xcite and homopolymer systems @xcite , and has been applied to various polymer systems @xcite to investigate their slow relaxation dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , rma has also been applied to biomolecular systems @xcite .",
    "the relaxation modes and rates are given as left eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the time - evolution operator of the master equation of the system , respectively @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium time correlation functions of the relaxation modes , @xmath0 , satisfy @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the equilibrium correlation of @xmath3 at time @xmath4 and @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , and @xmath7 represents the relaxation rate of @xmath3 .    in rma",
    ", we calculate the approximate relaxation modes and rates from a simulation .",
    "rma is formulated as a variational problem equivalent to the eigenvalue problem of the time - evolution operator of the system , where a relaxation mode @xmath3 is approximated by a trial function , which is constructed as a linear combination of relevant physical quantities that are time - evolved for @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is introduced in order to reduce the relative weight of the faster modes contained in the physical quantities .",
    "the optimization of the normalized equilibrium autocorrelation function of the trial function time - displaced by @xmath10 leads to the generalized eigenvalue problem . in practice ,",
    "the time correlation matrices of structural fluctuations for two different times ( @xmath9 and @xmath11 ) are calculated through simulations .",
    "then , by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem for these matrices , the relaxation rates and modes are obtained from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , respectively .",
    "thus , we call this method the rma method using a single evolution time : @xmath8 .",
    "recently , rma was applied to a monte carlo simulation for a heteropolymer peptide system with a small number of degrees of freedom@xcite , and its effectiveness was demonstrated . in the applications of rma to homopolymer systems @xcite , the translational degrees of freedom are removed from the conformations of the polymer sampled in a simulation . however , the rotational degrees of freedom are retained because the slow rotational relaxation of the polymer is important in polymer physics .",
    "in contrast , for heteropolymer biomolecule systems , both the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are removed from the sampled conformations of a biomolecule to allow for investigation of the structural fluctuations around its average conformation . in our previous report@xcite ,",
    "we explained how to treat such sampled conformations with rma , and succeeded in applying rma to a heteropolymer system .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated the effectiveness of rma to investigate the transitions between some local minimum - energy states by calculating the free - energy surfaces for relaxation modes .",
    "although rma is a powerful method for extracting slow modes , it requires a relatively high level of statistical precision of the time correlation matrices . owing to this requirement",
    ", rma requires a long simulation where many transitions between local minimum - energy states occur , which may not be a problem because such very long simulations have become feasible in recent years , as mentioned above .",
    "moreover , rma can not handle a large number of degrees of freedom directly .",
    "therefore , reduction of the degrees of freedom is necessary for application of rma to protein systems . to achieve this , we proposed a new analysis method , which is referred to as the principal component relaxation mode analysis ( pcrma ) method . in this method ,",
    "pca is carried out first and then rma is applied to a small number of principal components with large fluctuations .",
    "this method can systematically reduce the degrees of freedom .",
    "we also proposed the rma method using multiple evolution times , which can reduce the contribution of the fast modes efficiently . in our previous report",
    "@xcite , we explained the combination of two proposed methods involving the pcrma method using multiple evolution times , and demonstrated its applicability to an all - atom md simulation of human lysozyme in aqueous solution .",
    "recently , methods to analyze the dynamics and kinetics of protein simulations have been developed .",
    "in particular , the markov state model has been developed ( see refs .",
    "and reviews @xcite and references cited therein ) and used for many protein systems .",
    "the markov state model can analyze transitions between local minimum - energy states , which are identified from clustering analysis methods .",
    "this is a powerful method for analyzing dynamics in the context of both long and short simulations of proteins .",
    "as mentioned above , in rma , the relaxation modes and rates are given as left eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the time - evolution operator of the master equation of the system , respectively @xcite ( see appendix a ) .",
    "from this point of view , rma is related to markov state models ( see [ msrma ] , appendices a and b , and ref .  ) .",
    "an analysis method of protein dynamics based on md simulation was proposed @xcite that separates linearly superimposed statistically independent signals by using time correlation functions , and was thus designated as time - structure based independent component analysis ( tica ) . the method is closely related to rma , in that it determines statistically independent modes by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem with @xmath12 . recently ,",
    "the combination method of tica and a markov state model was also proposed @xcite . in ref .  , a markov state model was constructed from clustering in the subspace determined by tica , which was calculated using a method similar to pcrma .    in this study",
    ", we applied pca and rma to analyze the folding trajectories of a peptide , chignolin , near its folding transition temperature . as mentioned above",
    ", pca can not extract order parameters to easily identify the local minimum - energy states for a system with large conformational changes .",
    "this is because pca extracts the modes with large structural fluctuations around an average structure , and the pc modes with large structural fluctuations do not correspond to the transitions between the local minimum - energy states .",
    "on the other hand , rma can extract slow relaxation modes .",
    "the local minimum - energy states are usually stable and the system thus remains in this state for a long time during a simulation .",
    "the order parameters with slow relaxation may correspond to the directions between local minimum - energy states .",
    "thus , slow relaxation modes may be suitable order parameters to identify local minimum - energy states and the transitions between them .    to test this model",
    ", we performed a simulation of chignolin near its transition temperature .",
    "chignolin consists of a 10 amino - acid polypeptide that adopts a @xmath13-hairpin turn structure , and is the smallest artificial protein @xcite , which has been used for testing new simulation algorithms . indeed , there are many simulations for chignolin reported to date@xcite .",
    "previous research has shown that chignolin has a stable state ( native structure ) and a misfolded state .",
    "the native and misfolded structures are hairpin - like structures ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "they have a common turn structure from asp3 to glu5 and have slightly different hydrogen bond patterns .",
    "furthermore , the stability of the two states , i.e. , how often these two states are observed during a simulation , has been found to depend on the force field @xcite .",
    "we considered that by increasing temperature , many transitions between the two states may occur within a several hundred - nanosecond simulation .",
    "thus , we performed the simulation near the protein s transition temperature , which corresponds to a long simulation at room temperature .",
    "for estimation of the transition temperature , we refer to the results at a pressure of 1 atm obtained by the simulations in ref .  .",
    "we calculated the free - energy surfaces of the coordinates of pca and rma and show the effectiveness of rma for extracting order parameters of the protein system with large conformational changes .",
    "we also explain the relationship between rma and markov state models and propose a new analysis method called markov state relaxation mode analysis ( msrma ) .",
    "we evaluate the relaxation times of the states , which are defined by the free - energy surface from rma , using a simple markov state model and the new msrma method .",

    "the variance of @xmath33 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the rma method was developed to identify slow motions in random spin systems and homopolymer systems . in rma , we consider the following physical quantities : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the relaxation mode and its relaxation rate , respectively . here , @xmath37 denotes the equilibrium time correlation function of physical quantity @xmath38 at time @xmath4 and @xmath39 at time @xmath6 .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly explain how to use rma to extract slow relaxation modes and their relaxation rates from an md simulation that satisfies the detailed balance condition . here",
