    "efficient transportation systems are essential to the functioning and prosperity of modern , industrialized societies .",
    "engineers are therefore seeking solutions to the questions of how the capacity of the road network could be used more efficiently and how operations can be improved by way of intelligent transportation systems ( its ) . achieving this efficiency through automated vehicle control",
    "is the long - standing vision in transport telematics . with the recent advent of advanced driver assistance systems , at least partly automated driving is already available for basic driving tasks such as accelerating and braking by means of _ adaptive cruise control _ ( acc ) systems .",
    "an acc system extends earlier cruise control to situations with significant traffic in which driving at constant speed is not possible .",
    "the driver can not only adjust the desired velocity but also set a certain safe time gap determining the distance to the leading car when following slower vehicles .",
    "although originally developed to delineate human driving behaviour , _ car - following models _ can also be used to describe acc systems : a radar sensor tracks the car ahead to measure the net distance ( gap ) and the approaching rate , which serve ( besides the own speed ) as input quantities just as in many time - continuous car - following models .",
    "then , the acc system calculates the appropriate acceleration for adapting the speed and the safety gap to the leader .",
    "this analogy is scientifically interesting because a ` good ' car - following model could serve as basis of a control algorithm of a real - world acc system . on the one hand",
    ", the in - vehicle implementation would allow to judge the realism of the considered car - following model which is a further ( and promising ) approach towards benchmarking the plethora of car - following models .",
    "this question has recently been considered with different methods in the literature  @xcite . on the other hand , from the direct driving experience",
    "one may expect new insights for the ( better ) description of human drivers through adequate follow - the - leader models , which is still an ongoing challenge in traffic science  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one may raise the interesting question how the _ collective traffic dynamics _ will be influenced in the future by an increasing number of vehicles equipped with acc systems .",
    "microscopic traffic simulations are the appropriate methodology for this since this approach allows to treat ` vehicle - driver units ' individually and in interaction .",
    "the results , however , may significantly depend on the chosen modelling assumptions . in the literature ,",
    "positive as well as negative effects of acc systems have been reported  @xcite .",
    "this puzzling fact points to the difficulty when investigating mixed traffic consisting of human drivers and automatically controlled vehicles : how to describe human and automated driving and their interaction appropriately ?    the intelligent driver model ( idm )  @xcite appears to be a good basis for the development of an acc system .",
    "the idm shows a crash - free collective dynamics , exhibits controllable stability properties  @xcite , and implements an intelligent braking strategy with smooth transitions between acceleration and deceleration behaviour .",
    "moreover , it has only six parameters with a concrete meaning which makes them measurable .",
    "however , the idm was originally developed as a simple car - following model for one - lane situations .",
    "due to lane changes ( ` cut - in ' manoeuvres ) , the input quantities change in a non - continuous way , in which the new distance to the leader can drop significantly below the current equilibrium distance , particularly if there is dense or congested traffic , the lane change is mandatory , or if drivers have different conceptions of safe distance .",
    "this may lead to strong braking manoeuvres of the idm , which would not be acceptable ( nor possible ) in a real - world acc system .    in this paper , we therefore extend the idm by a new _ constant - acceleration heuristic _ , which implements a more relaxed reaction to cut - in manoeuvres without loosing the mandatory model property of being essentially crash - free .",
    "this model extension has already been implemented ( with some further confidential extensions ) in real test cars  @xcite . in a second part of this contribution",
    "we apply the enhanced idm to multi - lane traffic simulations in which we study the collective dynamics of mixed traffic flows consisting of human drivers and adaptive cruise control systems .",
    "the vehicles equipped with acc systems implement a recently proposed traffic - adaptive driving strategy  @xcite , which is realized by a situation - dependent parameter setting for each vehicle .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : model ] , we will present an improved heuristic of the idm particularly suited for multi - lane simulations .",
    "[ sec : vla ] presents traffic - adaptive driving strategies for adaptive cruise control systems .",
    "the impact of temporarily changed model parameters on the relevant traffic capacities in heterogeneous traffic flows will be systematically evaluated by simulations in  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "finally , we will conclude with a discussion in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "in this section , we will develop the model equations of the enhanced intelligent driver model .",
    "to this , we will first present the relevant aspects of the original intelligent driver model ( idm )  @xcite in   [ sec : model]@xmath0([sec : idm ] ) .",
    "while , in most situations , the idm describes accelerations and decelerations in a satisfactory way , it can lead to unrealistic driving behaviour if the actual vehicle gap is significantly lower than the desired gap , and , simultaneously , the situation can be considered as only mildly critical .    therefore , in   [ sec : model]@xmath0([sec : cah ] ) , we develop an upper limit of a safe acceleration based on the more optimistic ` constant - acceleration heuristic ' ( cah ) , in which drivers assume that the leading vehicle will not change its acceleration for the next few seconds . this ansatz is applicable precisely in these situations where the idm reacts too strongly . in   [ sec : model]@xmath0([sec : idm - cah - mix ] ) , we combine the idm and cah accelerations to specify the acceleration function of the final model for acc vehicles ( ` acc model ' ) such that the well - tested idm is applied whenever it leads to a plausible behaviour , using the difference @xmath1 as an indicator for plausibility . finally , the properties of the new model are tested by computer simulations in   [ sec : model]@xmath0([sec : cah - sim ] ) .",
    "the idm acceleration is a continuous function incorporating different driving modes for all velocities in freeway traffic as well as city traffic . besides the ( bumper - to - bumper- ) distance @xmath2 to the leading vehicle and the actual speed @xmath3",
    ", the idm also takes into account the velocity difference ( approaching rate ) @xmath4 to the leading vehicle .",
    "the idm acceleration function is given by @xmath5 , \\\\",

    "the free acceleration is characterized by the _ desired speed _ @xmath9 , the _ maximum acceleration _",
    "@xmath10 , and the exponent @xmath11 characterizing how the acceleration decreases with velocity ( @xmath12 corresponds to a linear decrease while @xmath13 denotes a constant acceleration ) .",
    "the effective minimum gap @xmath14 is composed of the _ minimum distance _",
    "@xmath15 ( which is relevant for low velocities only ) , the velocity dependent distance @xmath16 which corresponds to following the leading vehicle with a constant _ desired time gap _ @xmath17 , and a dynamic contribution which is only active in non - stationary traffic corresponding to situations in which @xmath18 .",
    "this latter contribution implements an ` intelligent ' driving behaviour that , in normal situations , limits braking decelerations to the _ comfortable deceleration _ @xmath19 . in critical situations , however , the idm deceleration becomes significantly higher , making the idm _ collision - free _",
    "the idm parameters @xmath9 , @xmath17 , @xmath15 , @xmath10 and @xmath19 ( see table  [ tab : params ] ) have a reasonable interpretation , are known to be relevant , are empirically measurable , and have realistic values  @xcite .",

    "in view of an increasing number of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control ( acc ) systems in the future , it is important to address questions about their impact and potentials on the collective traffic dynamics . until now",
    ", microscopic traffic models have mainly been used to ( approximately ) describe the _ human driver_. for a realistic description of the future mixed traffic , however , appropriate models for both human driving and automated driving are needed .",
    "car - following models reacting only to the preceding vehicle have originally been proposed to describe human drivers , but , from a formal point of view , they describe more closely the dynamics of acc - driven vehicles .",
    "thus , we have considered the simple yet realistic intelligent driver model ( idm )  @xcite as a starting point for an adequate description of the driving behaviour on a microscopic level .",
    "the idm , however , is intended to describe traffic dynamics in one lane only , and leads , e.g. in lane - changing situations , to unrealistic driving behaviour when the actual gap is significantly lower than the desired gap .",
    "for such situations , we have formulated an alternative heuristic based on the assumption of constant accelerations in order to prevent unnaturally strong braking reactions due to lane changes .",
    "the proposed enhanced idm combines the well - proven properties of the original model with this _ constant - acceleration heuristic _ resulting in a more relaxed driving behaviour in situations with are typically not considered to be critical by human drivers .",
    "the new acceleration function   depends ( besides gap and velocity ) additionally on the acceleration of the leading vehicle .",
    "since the enhanced idm is still a car - following model , we have called it ` acc model ' .",
    "in fact , it has already been implemented ( with some further confidential extensions ) in real test cars showing a realistic and natural driving dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this consistency between automated driving and the ` driving experience ' of humans can be considered as a key account for the acceptance of and the confidence in acc systems . moreover , since the driver is obliged to override the acc system at any point in time , an automated driving characteristics similar to those of human drivers is a safety - relevant premise .",
    "hence , a _ realistic _",
    "car - following , i.e. , an acc model can be considered also as a appropriate description of the human driving although humans perceptions and reactions fundamentally differ from those of acc systems  @xcite .",
    "the proposed acc - model has been used to evaluate potentials of a vehicle - based approach for increasing traffic performance in a mixed system consisting of human drivers and acc systems . while human drivers of cars and trucks have been modelled with constant model parameters , the proposed adaptation of the driving style according to the actual traffic conditions corresponds to parameters that vary _ over time_. note that the concrete meanings of the idm parameters allow for direct implementations of the considered driving strategies .    by means of multi - lane traffic simulations ,",
    "we have investigated the maximum free flow before traffic breaks down ( as crucial quantity in free traffic ) , and the dynamic capacity ( which determines as outflow from a traffic jam the dynamics in congested traffic ) by systematically increasing the fraction of vehicles implementing multiple driving strategies . for the maximum free flow",
    ", we found an approximately linear increase with a sensitivity of about @xmath20 per 1% acc fraction .",
    "the dynamic capacity shows a non - linear relationship with an increase of about 0.24% per 1% acc fraction for small equipment rates .",
    "both quantities can be considered as _",
    "measures for the system performance .",
    "these sensitivities multiply when considering other relevant measurements like travel times resulting in large variations by factors of 2 - 4  @xcite .",
    "the presented results reveal the ( positive ) impact of the driving behaviour on traffic dynamics even when taking into consideration the idealized assumptions and conditions in traffic simulations .",
    "finally , we note that the in - vehicle implementation of traffic - adaptive driving strategies and the detection of the proposed traffic conditions in real - time are investigated in ongoing research projects .",
    "different technologies such as specifically attributed maps  @xcite , inter - vehicle communication  @xcite , and vehicle - infrastructure integration  @xcite are considered at present .",
    "when dealing with simulations , one often varies a single model parameter and plots over it a second quantity that results from the related simulation run . here",
    ", a statistical method is presented that combines the gradual change in the independent model parameter @xmath21 with the estimation of the standard deviation in the resulting fluctuating quantity @xmath22 without running multiple simulations for the same parameter value @xmath21 .",
    "suppose we are fitting @xmath23 data points @xmath24 to a linear model with two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath19 , @xmath25 .",
    "a global measure for the goodness of fit is the sum of squared errors @xmath26 .",
    "the best - fitting curve for the _ linear regression _ can be obtained by the method of least squares with respect to the fit parameters @xmath10 and @xmath19 .",
