    "deuterium is thought to be produced in significant amount only during primordial big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and to be thoroughly destroyed in stellar interiors .",
    "deuterium is thus a key element in cosmology and in galactic chemical evolution ( see e.g. audouze & tinsley 1976 ; gautier & owen 1983 ; vidal  madjar & gry 1984 ; boesgaard & steigman 1985 ; olive _ et  al .",

    "the first ( indirect ) measurement of the deuterium abundance was carried out using @xmath12he in the solar wind , giving the presolar value d / h@xmath13 ( geiss & reeves 1972 ) .",
    "the first measurements of the d / h ratio in the interstellar medium ( ism ) were reported shortly thereafter by rogerson & york ( 1973 ) , and their value ( d / h)@xmath14 has remained a landmark average value for the interstellar d / h ratio .",
    "finally direct measurements of the primordial ( d / h ) ratio in low - metallicity material at high redshift have been successfully carried out these past few years ( e.g. , burles 2001 for a review , and references therein ) . the values derived cluster around ( d / h)@xmath15 although with significant dispersion , which may or may not be real .",
    "quite similarly the measurements of the ( d / h ) ratio in the galactic ism towards hot stars with the _ copernicus _ satellite lead to many evaluations of d / h ( see e.g. york and rogerson 1976 ; vidal  madjar _ et  al . _ 1977 ; laurent _ et  al . _",

    "this dispersion has been recently confirmed by imaps observations ( jenkins _ et  al .",
    "_ 1999 ; sonneborn _ et  al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , indicating that the d / h ratio may vary by a factor @xmath16 in the solar neighborhood , i.e. , within a few hundred parsecs .",

    "( 1998 ) : these targets can be chosen close to the sun , in order to avoid a complex line of sight structure , and in the high temperature range , so that the interstellar absorption is superimposed on a smooth stellar continuum . the risk of contamination by low column density h  i fluffs possibly present in the hot star winds ( gry , lamers & vidal  madjar 1984 ) is negligible for wds , and their hot continuum offers the possibility of observing the numerous uv lines of n  i and especially o  i , which is a very useful tracer of h  i and d  i. the ( d / h ) ratio has already been measured toward four white dwarfs , using the hst : g191-b2b ( lemoine _ et  al .",

    "for hz43a , sirius  b and feige  24 the average d / h values obtained are compatible with the local ism ( lism ) d / h determination ( linsky 1998 ) made within the local interstellar cloud ( the lic in which the sun is embedded ) , although in the case of sirius  b this compatibility is marginal .    in the case of g191-b2b",
    ", it was found that the line of sight comprises one neutral region corresponding to the lic , and two more ionized absorbing components ( lemoine _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; vidal - madjar _ et al .",
    "the average ( d / h ) ratio ( defined as the ratio of the total column densities of d  i and h  i ) was found to be ( d / h)@xmath17 ( vidal  madjar _ et  al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , significantly different from the value measured toward capella ( d / h)@xmath18 ( linsky 1998 ) . the ( d / h ) ratio measured toward g191-b2b has been contested by sahu et al . ( 1999 ) , who used stis data and concluded to the presence of two interstellar components only , and to a d / h ratio compatible with that observed toward capella .",
    "the disagreement resides in the evaluation of the total d  i column density ( vidal - madjar 2000 ; sahu 2000 ) , and arises presumably because the lyman  @xmath1  d line is saturated and the column density is thus sensitive to the line profile .",
    "the number of components assumed on the line of sight may also introduce differences between the analyses of these groups ( see vidal - madjar 2001 for a detailed discussion ) .    in the present work we re - examine these issues , making use of high quality _ fuse _ and stis observations of g191-b2b .",
    "we first measure the @xmath0(d  i ) , @xmath0(o  i )  and @xmath0(n  i )  column densities using the unsaturated lines of these elements in the _ fuse _ datasets , notably lyman  @xmath2  and lyman  @xmath3for d  i ( section  2 ) .",
    "we then analyze the recent high quality stis observations in section  3 , and provide explicit evidence for the presence of three absorbing components ( at least ) on the line of sight .",
    "we also provide a refined estimate of the total h  i column density .",
    "all throughout this work , considerable effort has been put on quantifying possible systematic uncertainties related to fixed - pattern noise , detector artifacts , background uncertainties , wavelength calibration and modeling of the stellar continua , as well as to the velocity structure of the line of sight .",
    "in particular , we argue in section  3.3 that previous estimates of the total @xmath0(h  i )  are subject to a large systematic uncertainty related to the possible presence of additional weak [ @xmath0(h  i)@xmath19@xmath20 hot ( @xmath21k ) components .",
    "this effect may have a large impact on our understanding of the observed variations of the ( d / h ) ratio in the ism , as it may affect other lines of sight , and is the subject of a companion paper ( vidal - madjar & ferlet 2002 ) .",
    "we provide a summary of our results and a short discussion in section  4 ; an overall discussion of the _ fuse _ results is given by moos _",
    "the _ fuse _ instrument ( moos _ et al . _ 2000 ; sahnow _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) gives access to the wavelength range 9051187  on eight detector segments , through three different entrance apertures ( the large , medium and narrow apertures ",
    "lwrs , mdrs and hirs , respectively ) and four channels ( two lif and two sic ) . in particular , it gives access to the higher order unsaturated lyman lines of d  i and can thus offer a reliable estimate of @xmath0(d  i ) .",
    "similarly , many weak lines of o  i and n  i are present in this bandpass , as shown in table  [ fuse - lines ] .",
    "the fuse spectrum of g191-b2b in the sic1b channel observed with the hirs aperture is shown in fig .",
    "[ fuse_hirs_1bsic ] , in which the lines of d  i ,",
    "n  i , o  i used in our study are indicated .",
    "the white dwarf g191-b2b has been observed several times with _ fuse _ through the three different entrance apertures ; the observation log is given in table  [ fuse - gbb ] .",
    "since the target is point - like , the resolutions obtained with these apertures should not be too different , but there is a clear variation due to some off - axis effect when moving from one aperture to another .",
    "the main problem comes from the geocoronal lyman  @xmath2 emission whose strength increases with the surface area of the aperture , and which blends with the interstellar h  i absorption .",
    "this leads us to employ different approaches in the analysis of the data , depending upon the slit used , as discussed below .",
    "the observations were treated through the version 1.8.7 of the calfuse pipeline .",
    "the data were then collected channel by channel by series of subexposures . due to the sensitivity of _ fuse _ and the brightness of the source ,",
    "the data were obtained in the histogram mode ( a spectral imaging mode , in which a two - dimensional spectrum was accumulated onboard ) .",
    "each subexposure has a s / n ratio that is high enough to clearly see the strong interstellar or photospheric features .",
    "the different subexposures could then be easily aligned on top of each other to compensate for the slow thermal drifts that displace the wavelength scale from one subexposure to another .",
    "these drifts never translates into more than @xmath22 pixels . a high s / n spectrum is thus reconstructed in each channel and for each aperture .",
    "this process preserves the ultimate _ fuse _ resolution and it also partly eliminates some of the detector s fixed pattern noise by acting like a random fp - split procedure .",
    "since the _ fuse _ sampling is @xmath23  pixels per resolution element , we rebinned the spectra by three .",
    "we measure column densities by profile fitting of the various lines observed , using the code owens.f developed by one of us ( m.  l. ) and the french _ fuse _ team .",
    "our general procedure for data analysis is as follows .",
    "we split each spectrum into a series of small sub - spectra centered on absorption lines to be analyzed , whose width is a few   depending on the line density and fit all lines contained in all sub - spectra simultaneously . between different sub - spectra ,",
    "the zero - point velocity offset is left to vary to compensate for the wavelength calibration ripple effects in _ fuse _ data ; the line spread function is generally taken to be a gaussian whose fwhm varies freely during the fitting procedure and independently from sub - spectrum to sub - spectrum .",
    "it is also checked that considering a double gaussian lsf with free widths , free amplitude ratio and zero pixel offset between the two gaussian components , does not change the results .",
    "the background levels used for each line are those evaluated at the bottom of the closest lyman line ( see fig .",
    "[ fuse_lyg ] for an example ) , which leads to an upper limit for the derived column densities ; fixing the background level at the 0 value gives access to the lower limit of the evaluated column densities .",
    "this uncertainty is taken into account in our procedure ; however _ fuse _ is operating in first order grating mounts and consequently the stray light level is generally quite low , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fuse_lyg ] for lyman  @xmath3 .",
    "this analysis procedure allows to reduce systematic uncertainties tied to fixed pattern noise effects or detector artifacts and uncertain calibration , since different lines of the same elements observed through different apertures and in different channels are fitted simultaneously .",
    "for instance , if a given line is subject to an artifact in the dataset , the @xmath24  of the fit in the region around this line , or equivalently the quality of the fit of this particular line should stand out in the overall fit if the number of lines analyzed is sufficiently large , as is the case here .",
    "moreover , by letting the unknown instrumental parameters vary freely , i.e. , the lsf shape and width , the background flux , the wavelength zero - point and the shape of the continuum , and be optimized simultaneously with the physical parameters that define the absorbers , one marginalizes the final result over these unknowns . therefore the errors attached to the uncertainty on these above characteristics are included in the final errors quoted for the column densities .",
    "finally , all lines are also analyzed one by one , _",
    "i.e. _ each independently of all others , in order to check for overall consistency . a detailed discussion of this procedure and survey of possible systematic errors tied to _ fuse _ data is given in a companion paper by hbrard _",
    "( 2002 ) .      since _ fuse",
    "_ can not resolve the velocity structure of the line of sight ( see section  3 ) , we have used only unsaturated lines of d  i , n  i and o  i and assumed only one interstellar component to be present .",
    "therefore , all measured column densities in this section are integrated over the line of sight .",
    "it has been verified that using three interstellar components in the fit of the _ fuse _ did not change the conclusions as long as only non - saturated lines were considered ; an example of single _ vs _",
    "multiple component fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fuse_lyg ] .",
    "note that hst observations can not give a reliable measurement of the o  i column density without a complete knowledge of the velocity and broadening structure of the line of sight since the only absorption line available at 1302  is strongly saturated .",
    "in contrast the n  i triplet at 1200  in the ghrs or stis bandpass is only moderately saturated and may provide a precise estimate of the total @xmath0(n  i ) .",
    "the various measurements of @xmath0(n  i )  and @xmath0(o  i )  are listed in table  [ oi_pub ] .    since the contamination of interstellar lines by weak photospheric lines is a likely possibility in the _ fuse _ spectral range due to the high density of atomic lines in this bandpass , we excluded from the fit all lines that presented an obviously excessive equivalent width or column density relative to the others .",
    "as an example as shown on figure  [ fuse_ni ] the n  i line at 954.1042  is very probably blended with a photospheric line which shows up at nearly the same wavelength in the nlte spectrum calculated with the tlusty / synspec codes ( described in section  3 ) .",
    "such blending becomes particularly important in the case of g191-b2b because the total o  i or n  i column densities are small , and their absorptions are relatively weak features which may be more easily blended with undetected photospheric ones .",
    "this is much less important for the other _ fuse _ ( d / h ) targets ( see the synthesis of _ fuse _ results by moos _",
    "et al . _",
    "2002 , and the individual line of sights studies by friedman _ et al . _",

    "2002 ) which presents a pure h atmosphere ( barstow , holberg & koester 1995 ; dupuis _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and thus no possible blend with photospheric lines .",
    "however note that this line selection process may induce in the case of g191-b2b a slight underestimation of the total o  i or n  i column densities .",
    "the o  i and n  i lines used in this study are listed in table  [ fuse - lines ] .",
    "some of them were rejected either because they are saturated ( marked `` strong '' in table  [ fuse - lines ] ) , or because of a blend with a photospheric feature ( marked `` blend '' ) , or because they are too weak and subject to systematic effects of the noise ( marked `` weak '' ) .",
    "some were kept in one channel but not in an other if a nearby detector defect was identified . for this reason , having the same spectrum observed in different independent channels was extremely helpful .    by following the general method depicted above , the final column density determinations are  :    log  @xmath0(o  i)@xmath25  =  14.86  ( @xmath26 )  ( @xmath27 ) + log  @xmath0(n  i)@xmath25  =  13.87  ( @xmath26 )  ( @xmath28 )    where the errors are first statistical ( 2@xmath29 ) and second systematic ( ) .",
    "the statistical errors were evaluated through the @xmath30 technique , an example of which is given for the @xmath0(d  i)determination to follow . however ,",
    "one important comment is of order at this point .",
    "the total @xmath24  for all spectral lines fitted simultaneously ( h  i , d  i , o  i and n  i ) in the case of the hirs observations is equal to 3211.44 for 1843 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , even though the fit appears very satisfactory by eye . this @xmath24  value lies well above the upper 95.5% confidence level limit for statistical fluctuation at 1966.71 .",
    "we interpret this large @xmath24  value as a result of a systematic underestimate of the magnitude of the individual pixel errors by the instrument . in order to quantify this uncertainty ,",
    "we have completed low order polynomial fits over relatively smooth and flat continuum sections close to each of the spectral lines analyzed .",
    "these simple fits gave a @xmath24 of 688 for 500 degrees of freedom , again above the 95.5% c.l .",
    "upper limit at 563.9 .",
    "this indicates that indeed the individual pixel errors are underestimated by instrument , probably due to the presence of fixed pattern noise in the data .",
    "the discrepancy in terms of ratio of measured to expected @xmath24  is not as strong as for the best - fit @xmath24  values , but this may be due to differences in the error levels for pixels located on the continuum and those located at the bottom of the saturated lyman lines .    in order to compensate for these effects , we have thus decided to rescale all @xmath24  measured , which amounts to an overall rescaling of the individual pixel error estimates .",
    "in particular , we have chosen to divide all @xmath24  by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 corresponds to the lowest expected @xmath24  at the 95.5% confidence level for 1843 d.o.f .",
    "this rescaling rescales ( increases ) the error bars on the physical parameters that we derive since the @xmath30 contour levels are also rescaled . in effect , in order to derive the @xmath33 error bar around a single parameter minimum value , we search the values of this parameter that lead to an increase in ( non - rescaled ) @xmath24 of @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "our choice of rescaling is thus very conservative with respect to the final error bars measured .",
    "all presented fuse statistical errors will be evaluated following this method .",
    "the systematic errors quoted above for o  i and n  i reflect the range of values obtained for the best - fit solutions for different apertures , given in table  [ oi_pub ] . note that in this table , the errors quoted include the satistical error plus part of the above systematic errors , since it accounts for the differences measured between different observations , different channels and different spectral ranges where lines of the species concerned are seen , but observed through the same aperture ( see the discussion in hbrard _",
    "et al . _",
    "note that the total o  i or n  i column density evaluations made with the lwrs+mdrs are in both cases lower than those made with the other apertures .",
    "we do not know the cause of this apparent systematic effect , but included it in the overall uncertainty on our result .",
    "the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties then leads to :    log @xmath0(o  i)@xmath25 = 14.86 ( @xmath36 ) + log @xmath0(n  i)@xmath25 = 13.87 ( @xmath36 )      in the _ fuse _ bandpass , d  i is clearly detected at lyman @xmath2 , weakly at lyman @xmath3 , and not at lyman @xmath37 .",
    "we list in table  [ di_pub ] the different estimates of the total column density of d  i that have been obtained from hst observations of lyman  @xmath1 , and which we measure using the present _ fuse _ data . here",
    "as well , we assumed that only one component is present on the line of sight since the d  i lines are optically thin .",
    "again we checked the impact of a more complex line of sight structure and found it to be negligible , as expected .",
    "we carried out the same investigations of systematic effects as for o  i and n  i , using the approach detailed above and in hbrard _",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "there is however one essential difference between d  i and o  i or n  i in terms of systematics . namely the continuum to the d  i absorption is provided by the blue wing of the corresponding h  i absorption , while the continuum around the o  i and n  i is very smooth .",
    "it is thus necessary to measure the possible systematic tied to the estimate of the stellar continuum on the measurement of @xmath0(d  i ) . in order to do so",
    ", we have measured @xmath0(d  i )  with and without beforehand correction of the data by a theoretical nlte stellar continuum ( described in section  3 ) .",
    "some corresponding fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fuse_lyg ] , and the best - fit to the hirs data is shown in fig .",
    "[ aas_fig2 ] .",
    "the effect of any assumption on the stellar continuum was found to be negligible as compared to the statistical uncertainty .",
    "however , we have found that the value of @xmath0(d  i )  measured if the h  i lines are excluded from the fit and their blue wing modeled by a polynomial is higher than when the h  i are included in the fit .",
    "this systematic effect may result from the following : in the latter ( standard ) approach , where both d  i and h  i are fitted together , the position of the d  i absorption is tied to that of h  i , i.e. , they have the same radial velocity and their zero point wavelength offsets are the same as both lines appear in the same sub - spectrum . however , in the former approach , the velocity of d  i is not subject to this constraint .",
    "these two approaches are denoted in table  [ di_pub ] as `` d  i & h  i '' ( standard approach ) and `` d  i , no h  i '' for the other one .",
    "one should note that a discrepancy in radial velocity between the d  i line and its counterpart h  i could be attributed to small scale ripples in the _ fuse _ wavelength calibration or to the presence of weak h  i absorbers which would shift the position of the h  i line with respect to that of the d  i line in which these absorbers would not be felt . in this respect",
    "the approach in which d  i is fitted independently of h  i seems more adequate ; however the interpolation of the blue wing of the h  i line by a polynomial is not always straightforward . we should mention that this systematic effect is not fully understood and does not seem to be always present on different lines of sight . in any case",
    "it is included in our estimate of the systematic error .",
    "finally a small additional systematic effect is found to be attached to the uncertainty in the shape of the lsf , i.e. whether it is a single gaussian or a double gaussian with wide wings ( indicated as `` double lsf '' in table  [ di_pub ] ) . as mentioned previously",
    ", a single gaussian lsf has a free fwhm in the fit , while a double gaussian lsf has free amplitude ratio between both components , free fwhm for each , but separation between both components fixed to zero pixel .",
    "the impact of the shape of the lsf on the measured @xmath0(d  i )  is shown in figure  [ aas_fig3 ] where the @xmath38 is plotted as a function of @xmath39@xmath0(d  i ) . in practice",
    "this curve is calculated by fixing @xmath39@xmath0(d  i )  to a given value , finding the best fit @xmath24  for this value with all other parameters free , and plotting the difference between this @xmath24  and the best @xmath24  obtained for all possible values of @xmath39@xmath0(d  i ) . in this figure",
    ", the curvature of a @xmath30 curve gives the statistical error , as usual , while the relative shift between two curves corresponding to two different sets of assumptions is interpreted as an estimate of the @xmath40 systematic error tied to the uncertainty on the assumptions .",
    "we thus conclude that the total d  i column density on this line of sight measured using the hirs data is :    @xmath41  i@xmath42 +    where the errors are first statistical ( 2@xmath29 ) and second systematics ( ) .",
    "combining these errors leads to :    @xmath41  i@xmath43    as can be seen from the comparison between the evaluations of @xmath0(d  i)made for the different apertures , there is no significant systematic effect tied to the aperture , contrary to the analysis for o  i and n  i. the average @xmath0(d  i )  measured through the different apertures then reads :    @xmath41  i@xmath44    this value agrees with all previously measured values of @xmath0(d  i ) shown in table  [ di_pub ] , except with that of sahu _ et al . _ ( 1999 ) , using the stis - ech#1 data , which gave @xmath39@xmath0(d  i)@xmath45 .",
    "it thus appears that the discrepancy between this value and the others should be attributed to the dataset used , in agreement with the conclusion of vidal - madjar ( 2001 ) , and the debate around the value of @xmath0(d  i )  is now settled .",
    "in this section we analyze new high resolution high signal - to - noise stis data of g191-b2b in order to determine the number of components on the line of sight and provide a new estimate of the total neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "as mentioned in section  1 , there exists a controversy in the literature about the total number of absorbing components , as sahu _",
    "( 1999 ) claimed to see two only , whereas vidal - madjar _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) claimed that three at least were present . in this section",

    "previous measurements of @xmath0(h  i )  are compiled in table  [ hi_pub ] ; these values scatter around a ( non - weighted ) mean @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)@xmath46 ( the dispersion corresponds to the non - weighted dispersion of the individual measurements around the mean ) .",
    "individual measurements tend not to agree with each other , and therefore a new independent estimate is useful .",
    "moreover we argue in this section that the total @xmath0(h  i )  toward g191-b2b is , as a matter of fact , much less well known than previously thought , since additional weak hot absorbing components may strongly affect the column density estimate from lyman @xmath1 .",
    "the new stis data analyzed here represent about three times the total exposure time cumulated hitherto toward g191-b2b .",
    "all stis observations were extracted following the method of howk and sembach ( 2000 ) .",
    "we selected spectral lines corresponding to n  i , o  i , si  ii , si  iii , c  ii , s  ii , s  iii in the e140h echelle configuration and fe  ii lines in the e230h one , both at @xmath47 resolving power , as reported in table  [ stislines ] .",
    "all these species are seen in one or more spectral lines , strong and/or weak , and cover a wide range of atomic masses , so that this data should provide strong constraints on the structure of the line of sight as well as on the component to component physical state and thermal and non - thermal broadening of each .    in order to verify",
    "that no photospheric line is blended with one of the interstellar lines analyzed , we have computed a synthetic spectrum of g191-b2b which includes all species observed in the atmosphere of g191-b2b , i.e. , c , n , o , si , p , s , fe , and ni ( lanz _ et al .",

    "after comparison with ghrs first order grating observations , we confirmed that the stis calibration was correct , and the ghrs calibration erroneous .",
    "we found that the average relative shift between two spectral regions in the stis data is @xmath52 km  s@xmath51  ( @xmath8 error ) .",
    "rms _ error of 0.5 km  s@xmath51  in the stis calibration is indeed compatible with the @xmath533.3 km  s@xmath51  resolution of the instrument .",
    "the stellar continua in each region are interpolated by low order polynomials ( except for lyman  @xmath1  where the theoretical continuum is used in some cases , see below ) , and the background level in each region is determined using the closest saturated line .",
    "the typical background flux is @xmath54 ( 2@xmath29 error ) of the continuum for the e140h data , and @xmath55 ( 2@xmath29 error ) for the e230h data . finally in some cases",
    "( see below for details ) , the lsf is left free to vary and corresponds either to a simple gaussian or to a double gaussian .",
    "again , we emphasize that the uncertainty on these instrumental characteristics is contained in the final error bars given below , which we determine using a @xmath30 method , since the corresponding parameters are left free to vary during the fit .    in the case of the stis observations made with the e140h and e230h echelle modes , we used the tabulated lsf , corresponding to the slit used for these observations ( 0.2@xmath560.2 arc sec ) .",
    "this is an important issue because these lsfs possess wings that could have some impact on the precise determination of the physical parameters we are aiming at . to test the quality of the fits we also tried a single gaussian lsf with free fwhm .",
    "we found excellent fits with this freely variable width single gaussian lsf for both echelle datasets .",
    "we find for the e140h an average fwhm@xmath57  pixel ( 2@xmath29 ) and for e230h , fwhm@xmath58  pixel ( 2@xmath29 ) .",
    "these determinations are certainly compatible with the tabulated lsf in terms of `` average '' widths , but are different in terms of shape .",
    "they correspond to 80,000 and 100,000 resolving power respectively for the e140h and e230h spectra .",
    "finally , we also tested double gaussian lsfs but found no significant improvement .",
    "we thus decided to present results with both types of lsfs ( free gaussians and tabulated ) in order to show the stability and robustness of our column density determinations .",
    "as we will see , such a change has negligible impact on the derived total h  i column density .",
    "following the analysis of the _ fuse _ data , we evaluate the accuracy of the intrument estimate of the individual pixel errors by completing low order polynomial fits over relatively smooth and flat continuum sections close to each of the fitted spectral lines .",
    "these simple fits give a total @xmath24=921.37 ( sum of all @xmath24  in the different portions of continuum analyzed ) for 661 degrees of freedom , which lies well above the upper 95.5% confidence level limit of 723.9 for a @xmath24 distribution with 661 d.o.f .",
    "therefore we rescale all @xmath24  by a common factor @xmath59 , where 600.63 corresponds to the lower 95.5% confidence level limit for 661 d.o.f .",
    "finally , in the course of the analysis , the physical characteristics of each absorbing component ( velocity @xmath60 , temperature @xmath61 and micro - turbulent broadening @xmath62 ) are determined ; however we will not provide a detailed analysis of these characteristics and their uncertainties since we are primarily interested in the total number of absorbing components and the total neutral hydrogen column density .      in order to settle the debate on the total number of absorbing components , we have studied two and three component solutions .",
    "simple eye inspection of the data indicates that at least two components are present on the line of sight ; as mentioned previously , the red component can be identified with the lic , a moderately neutral region , while the blue component is clearly more ionized , and , as we argue , more complex than a single absorber ( see vidal - madjar _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 and sahu _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "the result of this analysis is summarized in table  [ chi2 ] , which gives the @xmath24  values obtained for the fits of various spectral regions , and for all regions ( excluding lyman  @xmath1 ) , for two and three component solutions , using either the tabulated stis lsf or a freely varying single gaussian lsf .",
    "it is clear that the improvement in @xmath24 when going from two to three components is extremely high whichever lsf is used .",
    "this is particularly true for fe  ii in which case the improvement can be seen directly on figure  [ fe_2comp_3comp ] .",
    "indeed if one looks closely at the fe  ii lines , one can see an asymmetry of the line profile of the bluer component which is common to all fe  ii lines .",
    "this constitutes clear evidence for the presence of three absorbing components and not two .",
    "one sees this third component in fe  ii and not in other lines since fe  ii is the heaviest species , and its line widths are thus the smallest .",
    "moreover its lines have been observed through the echelle presenting the higher resolving power ( 100,000 ) .",
    "this suffices to reveal the double structure of component b : components b1 and b2 are separated by @xmath63 km  s@xmath51  ( 2@xmath29 ) , _ i.e. _ of the order of the e140h spectral resolution but more than that of the e230h .",
    "the radial velocities of the three components is estimated as @xmath64 km  s@xmath51 , @xmath65 km  s@xmath51and @xmath66 km  s@xmath51 , with @xmath40 errors due to the wavelength calibration .",
    "the lic velocity is in perfect agreement with its projected velocity on the line of sight .",
    "one can also see further evidence for the double structure b1-b2 in the s  iii 1190.2  line shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ stis_3comp_fig3 ] .",
    "this line is seen only in the bluest component b1 , which reflects the difference in ionization between the various components ; its spectral position is quite precisely known as it is located close to the si  ii line at 1190.4  and is seen in two different spectral orders ( see table  [ stislines ] ) .",
    "note that the position of most lines is actually very well controled , which is important to determine the number of absorbing components . in effect , the sharp geocoronal lines of n  i , o  i and o  i@xmath67 are in several locations ( see fig .",
    "[ stis_3comp_fig3 ] ) , notably close to interstellar lines of n  i , o  i and si  ii . other si  ii lines or fe  ii lines are well constrained since in each of these species the absorption due to the lic is sharp and pronounced , and serves as a useful spectral reference .",
    "in order to test the hypothesis that the presence of a third component is not required by the fit , we perform an @xmath68test .",
    "this test uses the fisher - snedecor law which describes the probability distribution of the @xmath24 ratio . here",
    "we test the probability that the decrease of the @xmath24 due to the inclusion of a third component could be due to the increase of free parameters and not to actual information contained in the data .",
    "the result is shown species by species and for all species fitted simultaneously in table  [ chi2 ] , and gives a probability @xmath69 that this third component is not required by the data .",
    "the @xmath68tests performed species by species also confirm our previous impression that si  ii and fe  ii are the two most sensitive species to the presence of this component .",
    "we also note that the need for a third component is present whichever lsf is used .",
    "we note that the @xmath24  values corresponding to the use of the tabulated stis lsf are too high , as they all lie above the upper 95.5% confidence level limit for statistical fluctuation ( an except being fe  ii for three components ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath24  values for a freely varying single gaussian lsf are satisfactory , since only o  i and si  ii stand out with @xmath24  beyond the 95.5% confidence level for the three component solution . their high @xmath24propagates into the total @xmath24  summed over all windows",
    ". however the si  ii 1190 , 1193  and o  i 1302  lines are saturated , and small errors in the estimates of the error bars at the bottom of the line could potentially explain large differences in @xmath24",
    ". in effect our procedure of rescaling the @xmath24 amounts to rescaling all error bars by a common factor , which may not be correct for pixels at the bottom of saturated lines for the following reason .",
    "error bars on flux values arise as a combination of background noise , fixed pattern noise and poisson noise .",
    "background noise dominates for pixels with flux values close to zero , while for high s / n data poisson noise or fixed pattern noise would dominate in the continuum . if the errors in the estimation of the noise array for the background component and for the continuum component ( fixed pattern or poisson ) are different , then the procedure of rescaling error bars with a common factor is , strictly speaking , incorrect .",
    "finally , since this rescaling factor was estimated from the continuum , this rescaling should be correct for all pixels whose error is not dominated by the other noise component ( background ) .",
    "we also note that this o  i line has a complex profile , with two geocoronal and one nearby photospheric feature ( see figure  [ stis_3comp_fig3 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to keep this line in our analysis as it adds important constraints on the b1 and lic component t and @xmath62 parameter evaluations .",
    "using the @xmath68test , we can determine the probability that the use of the freely varying gaussian lsf is not required ( instead of using the stis lsf ) .",
    "in all cases , it is found that this probability is smaller than @xmath70 , and therefore we conclude that the gaussian lsf with a width that varies from spectral region to spectral region is required to fit the stis data . this result may be unexpected but it can find a simple explanation in the fact that the tabulated stis lsf is an average lsf given over the whole spectral range , while our gaussian lsf has a fwhm that varies with wavelength . for standard datasets",
    "it is probably sufficient to use the stis lsf but the very high quality of the present data necessitates higher order corrections to this lsf .",
    "in particular we noted a slight broadening of the lsf near the order edges .",
    "furthermore , the wings of the tabulated lsf are not so important and the single gaussian lsfs are sufficient to properly fit the data .",
    "we thus conclude that three absorbers are present on the line of sight to g191-b2b .",
    "the background level is directly measured at the bottom of the strongly saturated lyman  @xmath1 line .",
    "it is found to be of the order of @xmath71 ( 2@xmath29 ) of the nearby continuum , i.e. within a few percent .",
    "variations in the photospheric continuum over the interstellar lyman  @xmath1 line presents an additional difficulty .",
    "indeed the instrument sensitivity over this spectral region is evaluated by using model spectra of white dwarfs and comparing them to the data , and one of the calibration wds used is g191-b2b itself .",
    "therefore it is difficult to separate the instrumental effects from the photospheric intrinsic profile in the spectrum processed through the stis pipeline .",
    "for this reason , we follow the approach detailed in vidal  madjar _",
    "( 1998 ) and further discussed by vidal ",
    "madjar ( 2000 ) , and evaluate simultaneously all parameters and the stellar continuum , which we model in two different ways . in the first approach , we model this continuum as a polynomial whose parameters are adjusted during the fitting procedure , and which represents the real photospheric profile times the instrument sensitivity ; we denote this fitting model `` _ u _ '' , which stands for uncorrected ( as the data have not been corrected prior to the fit by a stellar model ) . in the second approach ,",
    "we correct the data prior to the fit by a stellar model and keep a free low - order polynomial during the fit which models the inaccuracy of the stellar model and the variation of the instrument sensitivity ; we denote this approach by `` _",
    "the calculated stellar model was shifted by 24.56  km  s@xmath51  in order to be consistent with the velocity of the photospheric features clearly detected in n  v and si  iii ( see figure  [ stis_3comp_fig3 ] ) .",
    "these two approaches have been followed in parallel to estimate the uncertainty in the modeling of the stellar continuum on the final solution .",
    "we use two models to compute the photospheric lyman  @xmath1 line profile .",
    "first , we use the program synspec ( i.  hubeny 2000 , private communication ) in conjunction with the tlusty nlte metal line - blanketed model described above .",
    "this version of synspec contains the lemke s stark broadening tables for hydrogen , which were computed by lemke ( 1997 ) within the framework of vidal , cooper , & smith ( 1973 ) .",
    "second , we use detlev koester s lte code and his best fit parameters derived under the assumption of pure - h lte ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) . figure  [ lyaandmodel ] shows the nlte and lte lyman  @xmath1 line profiles and illustrates that nlte effects are significant only in the core of the line , which is formed high in the atmosphere where departures from lte are important ( wesemael _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 ) . however , as is shown in fig .  [ lyaandmodel ]",
    "the observations do not contain any information in that central region of the photospheric line simply because it is lost at the bottom of the saturated interstellar lyman  @xmath1  line .",
    "our fitting procedure will however be able to test the slightly different slopes in the wings of the models .",
    "an additional correction made by a low - order polynomial is needed not only to take into account uncertainties in the instrument sensitivity but also because when one fits a section of the g191-b2b stellar continuum devoid of stellar or interstellar absorption , it is necessary to model the continuum with a polynomial of degree of order 1 to 3 for a spectral width of order 0.3  ( see for instance fig .",
    "[ stis_3comp_fig3 ] ) . for a spectral region of width @xmath74",
    "as is the case for lyman  @xmath1 , a 6@xmath75 order polynomial provides a satisfactory approximation to the stellar continuum .",
    "the best - fit solutions obtained for 3 components on the line of sight for all lines in the stis domain including lyman  @xmath1  and for various models ( prior correction or not of the lyman  @xmath1  stellar continuum , type of lsf ) are summarized in table  [ 3complya ] .",
    "the zero point wavelength of the lyman @xmath1 spectral domain was found to be compatible with the other regions well within the @xmath40 uncertainty of 0.5 km  s@xmath51 .",
    "concerning the fit with a free double gaussian ( model 5 in table  [ 3complya ] ) , we found that the wings of the broader gaussian ( about 5 to 10 times larger than the narrow one ) contribute in amplitude ( relatively to the amplitude of the narrow core gaussian ) to less than 1@xmath76 in all but 5 spectral windows , less than 2@xmath76 in 3 of these 5 and to about 3@xmath76 in the 2 remaining ones . since",
    "this effect is marginal , we kept only as comparison tests the use of both the tabulated stis lsf or the simple gaussian lsf .",
    "all these effects were included in the evaluation of the statistical errors .",
    "it appears that different values of @xmath0(h  i )  are obtained depending on the model used ; in particular the comparison of models 1 and 2 on the one hand , and of models 3 and 4 on the other hand shows that the value of @xmath0(h  i )  derived depends whether the stellar continuum at lyman  @xmath1  has been corrected or not beforehand by a theoretical stellar profile .",
    "one obtains @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)=18.37 for an uncorrected profile , and @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)=18.32 for a corrected stellar profile .",
    "since there is no significant difference in @xmath24  between these solutions , this discrepancy must be interpreted as a systematic uncertainty tied to the choice of modeling of the continuum . a @xmath30 analysis around each of these solutions",
    "give a statistical error of @xmath77 dex ( @xmath40 ) , so that the value of @xmath0(h  i )  is dominated by the above systematic error .",
    "furthermore after correction of the stellar continuum by an lte calculation , which as shown in fig .",
    "[ lyaandmodel ] represents an intermediate situation between nlte and non - corrected stellar profiles , the value of @xmath0(h  i )  derived was found to be an intermediate value between the above two .",
    "however a further systematic error appears if additional weak hot components are present on the line of sight , and its investigation is the subject of the following section .      one can not exclude the presence of weak h  i components which could perturb or bias the measurement of @xmath0(h  i ) , but could not be detected in any other species due to their weak column density .",
    "such absorbers could arise as the signature of high velocity shocks ( cowie _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ) , or as cloud interfaces with the hot gas within the local ism ( bertin _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) or as `` hydrogen walls '' , i.e. , the shock interaction between the solar wind ( or stellar wind ) and the surrounding ism ( linsky 1998 ) . the latter possibility has been modeled by wood _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , and a prediction for the line of sight toward g191-b2b is shown in fig .",
    "[ hwall ] overlaid on the stis data .",
    "it shows that most of the expected absorption should take place in the saturated core of the interstellar line , but some weak absorption ( @xmath78 ) may be present , extending over several tenths of an angstrom on the red side of the line , due to the neutral hydrogen atoms seen behind the shock in the downwind direction where g191-b2b is located .",
    "we have thus investigated the possible impact of additional weak hot components on the determination of @xmath0(h  i ) . in order to do so , we have added one or two additional components in h  i only , and performed the fit of all lines as before with an nlte correction of the lyman  @xmath1profile and using a free single gaussian lsf ( model 3 ) . in order to constrain the presence of these extra absorbers , we have added to the fit the four lyman  @xmath2  lines observed through the _ fuse _ hirs aperture . for each new model characterized by the number of additional components , we have measured @xmath0(h  i )  using a @xmath30 analysis .",
    "the best fit solutions with zero , one and two extra absorbers are shown for lyman  @xmath1  and lyman  @xmath2  in fig .",
    "[ lyalyb ] .",
    "we have found that this introduction of additional components leads to a substantial decrease of the total @xmath0(h  i )  together with a significant improvement of @xmath24 . in particular",
    ", we found that the best fit solution for one extra component leads to @xmath79 ( 1961 d.o.f . ) and @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)=18.24 , and two extra components lead to @xmath80 ( 1958 d.o.f . ) and @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)=18.11 .",
    "the @xmath24values quoted have been rescaled by a factor 1.53 corresponding to the stis data obtained in the previous section , and which remains close ( 20% ) to the factor measured in the _ fuse _ data range . moreover , if a @xmath30 analysis is performed for each model , the curve obtained flattens for low values of @xmath0(h  i )  down to @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)=@xmath81 ; in other words , the space of solutions becomes degenerate in the low @xmath0(h  i )  region , and consequently the value of @xmath0(h  i )  measured from the profile fitting of the lyman  @xmath1  region is subject to a large systematic uncertainty .",
    "this behaviour can be explained as follows . in the three component",
    "best fit solution , most of the hydrogen is contained in the lic whose absorption makes the red wing of lyman  @xmath1 . in the solutions with extra absorbers , the combined profile of these hot components can replace the damping wing contribution of the lic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lyalyb ] .    in order to scan the parameter space ,",
    "the @xmath0(h  i)@xmath82 has been forced to take various values , since the profile fitting code can not force the total h  i column density to take a particular value . when the lic @xmath0(h  i )  becomes negligible with regards to the total @xmath0(h  i ) , we force the next dominant component to take various values of @xmath0(h  i ) . in this way it is possible to scan the parameter space of the total @xmath0(h  i ) .",
    "one finds that once the lic has become negligible , component b2 makes most of the total @xmath0(h  i ) , and that when the total @xmath0(h  i )  is taken below @xmath81 , the @xmath24  rapidly increases , which gives the final error bar on the total @xmath0(h  i )  estimate .    at this stage , one should point out that these best - fit solutions are quite difficult to find .",
    "the impact of additional weak absorbers on the profile fitting of @xmath0(h  i )  had already been studied by vidal - madjar _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) but no significant effect had been found , as the above solutions had eluded detection .",
    "the above solutions have actually been obtained only in a late stage of the present work .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for the fact that the @xmath24  surface becomes complex when additional unconstrained absorbers are introduced in the fit of the fully blended lyman  @xmath1  profile and optimization is then delicate .",
    "one should also remark that we have modeled these extra absorbers using voigt profiles , which implicitly assumes a maxwellian distribution for the velocities of the atoms . however",
    "if these absorbers correspond to interstellar structures similar to hydrogen walls , the latter assumption is incorrect and the overall profile should be closer to that modeled by wood _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) and shown in fig .  [ hwall ] .",
    "for this reason , the above modeling and solutions should be interpreted as a first approximation . for this reason",
    "as well , we do not discard the values for @xmath0(h  i )  obtained in the previous section without additional absorbers , even though the presence of extra absorbers induce a significant gain in @xmath24 . at the worst the final value for @xmath0(h  i )  will be more conservative . with these remarks in mind",
    ", we conclude that the total hydrogen content toward g191-b2b should be contained in the interval :    @xmath83  i@xmath84    in the absence of any indication on the distribution of the errors for @xmath0(h  i ) , we consider the above two extreme values as @xmath8 limits since they correspond to rather extreme solutions , and quote the following value for @xmath0(h  i ) : @xmath39@xmath0(h  i)@xmath85 ( @xmath40 error ) .",
    "one should note that this effect of additional absorbers had not been found in previous studies of the total hydrogen content toward g191-b2b .",
    "therefore it is important to remark that the above large uncertainty must also affect the previous values of @xmath0(h  i ) . in other words ,",
    "the above results supersedes any previous estimate of @xmath0(h  i)made toward g191-b2b using profile fitting of the lyman  @xmath1  line .",
    "one may also wonder whether extra absorbers may affect the determination of @xmath0(h  i )  toward other stars ; this important question is the subject of a forthcoming paper ( vidal - madjar & ferlet 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the above value for @xmath0(h  i )  should be contrasted with the value derived from euve observations and modeling of the atmosphere of g191-b2b which gave @xmath86(h  i)=@xmath87 ( dupuis _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , 2@xmath29 error ) , @xmath86(h  i)=@xmath88 ( lanz _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , no error bar quoted ) and the recent detailed measurement @xmath89(h  i)=@xmath90 ( barstow & hubeny 1998 ; this value also agrees with the more recent work of barstow , hubeny & holberg 1999 ) . these values would tend to indicate that the contamination of the lyman  @xmath1  profile by weak hot absorbers ( if any ) is not important , as they agree with the values we obtained without including such extra absorbers",
    "however , as noted in barstow & hubeny ( 1998 ) , these fits of the euve spectrum of g191-b2b typically lead to very large and unexplained reduced @xmath24 , implying that the overall fit is not yet satisfactory in spite of the use of sophisticated wd atmosphere models , and that some unknown effects have yet to be accounted for .",
    "we have measured the total column densities of d  i , n  i and o  i toward g191-b2b using unsaturated absorption lines of these elements in high quality _ fuse _ spectra . after a careful examination of the possible systematic uncertainties tied to the choice of the stellar continuum and to the instrumental configuration ,",
    "we have derived the following column densities with @xmath8 uncertainties :      we have also analyzed new high signal - to - noise ratio high resolution stis observations of g191-b2b and provided concrete evidence for the presence of at least three interstellar absorbing components on the line of sight by analyzing the interstellar absorption lines of n  i , o  i , si  ii , si  iii , s  iii and fe  ii present in the stis bandpass .",
    "we have also measured the total hydrogen column density on the line of sight using the velocity structure derived from the above metals .",
    "we have performed an exhaustive study of systematic effects on the value of @xmath0(h  i ) . in particular",
    "we have discovered a new major source of uncertainty on @xmath0(h  i )  tied to the possible presence of additional weak hot absorbers whose combined absorption profile can contribute significantly to the wings of the blended lyman  @xmath1  profile .",
    "the column density of these absorbers is small compared to the other main components , and they would not be detected in any other species than h  i , but their contribution to the lyman  @xmath1 absorption profile can reduce significantly the total h  i column density measured from the profile fitting . in order to constrain their impact , we have analyzed simultaneously lyman  @xmath1 and the higher order lyman lines , and concluded that the best value of @xmath0(h  i )  toward g191-b2b is :      we emphasize that this uncertainty is a systematic uncertainty which had gone unnoticed before .",
    "therefore the above result supersedes previous estimates of @xmath0(h  i )  toward g191-b2b obtained from the profile fitting of lyman  @xmath1 .",
    "a detailed analysis of this uncertainty and its consequences on @xmath0(h  i )  determinations toward other stars is discussed in a companion paper ( vidal - madjar & ferlet 2002 ) .",
    "we thus derive the following neutral abundance ratios toward g191-b2b , with @xmath8 uncertainties :      most of the uncertainty in the above result results from the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath0(h  i )  determination .",
    "this clearly shows the importance of measuring accurate ( d / o ) and ( d / n ) ratios in the interstellar medium instead of abundances relative to hydrogen , as emphasized by timmes _",
    "interestingly if one uses the recent measurement of @xmath0(h  i )  from the modeling of the atmosphere of g191-b2b and the fit of the euve spectrum , @xmath86(h  i)@xmath99 ( @xmath8 ) , one finds @xmath100 ( @xmath8 ) . at this stage , however , due to the uncertainty inherent to the modeling of the white dwarf atmosphere , it is probably more conservative to use the interstellar determination for @xmath0(h  i ) , and therefore the previous value of the ( d / h ) ratio .",
    "the above new value for the ( d / h ) ratio agree with the range of values measured by linsky ( 1998 ) toward a dozen stars of the lism and with the values previously derived toward g191-b2b .",
    "however the discrepancy between previous estimates of the ( d / h ) ratio toward g191-b2b and the lism average d / h ratio has disappeared due to a revision of the uncertainty on the estimation of the total h  i content .",
