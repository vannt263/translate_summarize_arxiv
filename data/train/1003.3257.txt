    "this effect is observed in molecular clouds located near cr acceleration sites in the milky way @xcite , but if @xmath214 , the entire starburst is illuminated this way , and the total pionic @xmath0-ray luminosity can not be increased further .",
    "the observed @xmath0-rays from m82 and ngc 253 have important implications for the physics of the radio emission of starburst galaxies ( see ltq and references therein ) .",

    "detailed models of starburst regions by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find that secondary @xmath186 are the majority of @xmath215 @xmath186 , although the number of primary electrons is still within a factor of a few of the secondaries .",
    "the @xmath0-ray to radio ratio provides an important constraint on the cooling mechanism of ghz - emitting electrons , if the @xmath0-rays are pionic .",
    "this ratio can be understood through a simple argument as follows .",
    "suppose the protons ( and secondary @xmath186 ) have an @xmath216 spectrum , with equal energy in each log @xmath217 bin .",
    "the protons lose energy to pions ; roughly 2 times as much energy goes into @xmath0-rays as electrons and positrons .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath218 , the synchrotron emission from each log bin in @xmath186 energy is spread over 2 log bins in synchrotron frequency .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath0-ray emission is dominated by diffuse pionic emission , and if the radio emission is dominated by secondary @xmath186 , @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the energies of @xmath0-rays and @xmath186 respectively from cr protons of the same energy , and @xmath222 is the fraction of cr @xmath186 power going into synchrotron .",
    "cr protons produce pionic @xmath0-rays with @xmath223 and secondary @xmath186 with @xmath224 .",
    "since electrons that emit ghz synchrotron radiation have an energy of @xmath225 , we compare gev @xmath0-rays and ghz radio emission .",
    "the ghz flux of m82 and the starburst core of ngc 253 are 9 and 3 jy respectively @xcite , while the @xmath226 fluxes are @xmath227 and @xmath228 respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath229 is @xmath230 for m82 and @xmath231 for ngc 253 , if all of the @xmath0-ray flux is from their starburst cores . if we instead consider the total ghz radio emission of ngc 253 , 6 jy , then @xmath232 .",
    "this implies strong non - synchrotron losses , consistent with bremsstrahlung and ionization cooling , and may be a hint that the `` high-@xmath183 conspiracy '' advocated by ltq as an explanation for the linear frc in dense starbursts is operating in m82 and ngc 253 . note",
    "that if some radio emission were from primaries , this would require even greater non - synchrotron losses .",
    "if @xmath233 is much higher than we suppose , the @xmath186 accompanying gev @xmath0-rays emit at higher frequencies , but since the radio spectrum only goes as @xmath234 @xcite , even an order of magnitude increase in @xmath233 only changes our conclusions by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "m82 and ngc 253 appear to have steeper gev - to - tev spectral slopes than @xmath103 , but the basic conclusions are unchanged with a more careful analysis .",
    "most of the @xmath186 emitting at ghz are expected to be secondaries from cr protons , injected with a @xmath235 spectrum .",

    "it also shows that the simpler estimate in equation  ( [ eqn : simplegevghz ] ) is a useful approximation even when @xmath253 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the idea that most of the radio emission in m82 and ngc 253 s starburst are from secondaries undergoing strong non - synchrotron losses .",
    "however the exact values of these ratios are still fairly uncertain .",
    "the main uncertainties are the fraction of @xmath0-rays from diffuse pionic emission , the fraction of radio emission from primary cr @xmath186 , the fraction of @xmath0-rays and radio from the starburst cores as opposed to the outlying disk galaxies , and the uncertainties in the @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
