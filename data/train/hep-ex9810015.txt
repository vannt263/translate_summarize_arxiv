    "recently , the d  and cdf collaborations at the fermilab tevatron have both published  @xcite limits on the pair production of the first generation scalar leptoquarks that ruled out an interpretation of the hera high-@xmath1 event excess reported by the h1 and zeus collaborations  @xcite as an @xmath2-channel production of leptoquarks with 100% branching fraction to the charged lepton channel ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "d  set a 95% confidence level ( cl ) lower limit of 225  gev on the mass of such a leptoquark ; the analogous cdf limit is 213  gev .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a combination of the results of the two experiments , using both bayesian and traditional frequentist approaches , that results in a tighter limit of 242 gev .",
    "this is the most restrictive limit on the leptoquark mass to date .",
    "the experimental results from both experiments are summarized in table  [ table : cdfd0 ] . in the region of interest ( leptoquark mass @xmath3  gev )",
    "neither experiment observes any candidate events .    0.1 in [ table : cdfd0 ]    .individual results from the cdf and d  experiments [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to obtain a combined limit",
    ", we need to understand the correlations between the two experiments . we have considered a number of systematic errors for different parameters used in the calculation of the integrated luminosities , efficiencies , and backgrounds for each of the experiments .",
    "central values of these parameters and fractional errors in each of them are summarized in table  [ table : combined ] .",
    "let us discuss some of these errors in more details .",
    "cdf determines the integrated luminosity based on its own measurements of the inelastic , single and double diffractive cross sections .",
    "the dcalculation of the integrated luminosity is based on both the cdf  @xcite and e710  @xcite inelastic , single diffractive , and double diffractive cross section measurements .",
    "since the two measurements of the inelastic cross section differ by nearly two standard deviations , a @xmath4-based factor of 1.85 is used to scale the errors in the inelastic cross sections of the two experiments ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the single and double diffractive cross section measurements are in a good agreement and therefore no scaling of the errors quoted by either experiment was done for these cross sections . for simplicity of calculation",
    "we use here just the average of single and double diffractive cross sections for both the cdf and d  luminosity calculation ( cdf in fact uses just their own measurement but numerically it does not affect the results at all ) .",
    "we further neglect the error on the double diffractive cross section since it is small compared to the errors in the inelastic and single diffraction cross sections .",
    "the cdf- and d - specific luminosity errors are then calculated by subtracting in quadrature the error due to the cross section measurements ( based on each experiment s approach ) from the total quoted errors of 7.2% ( cdf ) and 5.3% ( d ) .",
    "the other source of common systematics is the error in efficiency due to the mc modelling of the signal , dominated by the uncertainties due to parton distribution functions and gluon radiation .",
    "this fractional 10% error is assumed to be completely correlated between the two experiments and folded in the efficiency for each experiment as a @xmath5 factor .",
    "then the cdf- and d - specific efficiency errors are obtained by subtracting the common 10% error in quadrature from the overall quoted 11% ( cdf ) and 12% ( d ) efficiency errors , which gives the experiment - specific errors of : 4.9% ( cdf ) and 6.5% ( d ) .    0.1 in     ||l| c| c|| parameter & center value & fractional uncertainty + cdf inelastic c.s .",

    "in the bayesian aproach we will define probability functions for each experiment in such a way that they take into account correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties .",
    "we assume gaussian errors in all the parameters .",
    "we start by determining the 95% cl upper limits from each experiment independently , i.e. reproducing published numbers .",
    "since neither experiment observed any candidate events in the region of interest , the likelihood function of each measurement is given by poisson distribution with given expected signal and background means : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the expected signal for a given integrated luminosity @xmath9 and efficiency @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the expected background , and @xmath12 represents other prior information . for a given cross section of the leptoquark pair production @xmath13",
    "we have : @xmath14 we can now apply bayes theorem and write down the expression for the posterior probability for the cross section @xmath13 , given the observation of zero events in the data : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are prior probability densities for efficiency , integrated luminosity and backgrounds , and are gaussian by assumption . finally , @xmath19 is the prior for the signal cross section , and since the most basic assumption about the signal is that it can not be negative , but otherwise can be anything , a natural choice for the signal prior is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is @xmath22-function , defined as @xmath23 for @xmath24 and 1 for @xmath25 .",
    "an efficient way to calculate the integral ( [ eq : posterior ] ) is to use a monte carlo ( mc ) integration by generating random values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 an @xmath11 according to their gaussian priors .",
    "the value of the integral is simply the average value of @xmath26 obtained in the series of the mc trials , since by definition probability density functions are normalized to unity .",
    "we then vary the input value of @xmath13 for the mc trials to obtain @xmath27 in the entire range : @xmath28 .",
    "the upper 95% confidence level limit on signal cross section , @xmath29 , can then be obtained by solving the following integral equation : @xmath30 ( here we have to normalize the posterior probability to unity since @xmath31 is not properly normalized . )    from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) it is natural to expect that @xmath32 can be parameterized as @xmath33 . in this case equation ( [ eq : s95 ] )",
    "transforms into : @xmath34 which can be easily solved : @xmath35    we can now apply this approach independently to the cdf and dmeasurements .",
    "the only subtlety here is that the efficiency @xmath10 generally depends on the leptoquark mass , and thus far we have not made any connections between the mass and the cross section .",
    "one can obtain a more complex two - dimensional function @xmath36 and then obtain a cross section limit for any given leptoquark mass .",
    "we however , will use the fact that for the leptoquark masses above 200 gev the efficiency changes very slowly , and we simply use the efficiency measured at the published value of the mass limit for each experiment in order to reproduce the results .",
    "when calculating the limits for each particular experiment , we do not care about correlated and uncorrelated errors , and therefore can simply use overall uncertainties on @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for each experiment . in the case of cdf",
    ", there was no background estimate made , and therefore no background subtraction was used when obtaining cross section limits .",
    "this fact , however , does not influence the limit since it is well known  @xcite that for the case of zero observed candidate events , the limit on the signal does not depend on the actual value of the background or its uncertainty .",
    "we therefore assign background @xmath37 events in the cdf case .",
    "the estimates of @xmath38 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for each of the experiments are summarized in table  [ table : separate ] .    0.1 in     ||l| c| c|| parameter & cdf & d   + @xmath9 & @xmath39 pb@xmath6 & @xmath40 pb@xmath6 + @xmath10 & @xmath41% & @xmath42% + @xmath11 & n / a & @xmath43 +    [ table : separate ]    a posterior probability function for d   experiment",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0 ] , together with an exponential fit .",
    "the fit has essentially @xmath44 , so indeed the assumption of exponential approximation works well .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : s95exp ] ) we obtain the following 95% cl upper limits on the production cross sections : @xmath45 which can be translated into the lower mass limits on the first generation scalar leptoquarks using parameterization of the lower band of next - to - leading order cross section  @xcite : @xmath46 in agreement with the published values  @xcite .",
    "having reproduced the individual results of each experiment , we can now combine them by breaking down the errors of each of the experiments into several pieces and by using one and the same random values for the correlated uncertainties , and different values for the uncorrelated ones during the mc integration .    for the combined results from the two experiments we again have zero candidates observed , so the only required modification to the eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) is that the signal expectation is : @xmath47 where indices 1 and 2 correspond to the cdf and d   experiments , respectively .",
    "the overall background expectation is still the same , since we use no background for the cdf case .",
    "the rest of the formalism does not change , except that now we integrate not over @xmath48 , but over all the individual gaussian uncertainties used in the joint analysis ( see table  [ table : combined ] ) .    after performing the mc integration",
    "we obtain the posterior probability function for the cdf and d   measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] , which is well described by an exponential .",
    "the following 95% cl limits on the production cross section and the leptoquark mass are obtained : @xmath49 this is the final result of the bayesian combined analysis .",
    "in the classical or frequentist approach , the upper limit at a confidence level @xmath50 is defined such that , when the experiment is repeated a large number of times , the fraction of experiments that observe a value smaller or equal to the measured one is less or equal to @xmath50 , if the true value of the quantity is larger than the upper limit .",
    "if the number of observed events is small they will be distributed according to poisson statistics , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of observed events and @xmath53 = @xmath54 is the most probable number of events produced .",
    "@xmath38 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath10 is the efficiency , and @xmath13 is the production cross section . if we have two measurements of the same quantity , the total likelihood of observing @xmath55 and @xmath56 events from the same source is : @xmath57    to account for systematic uncertainties on the efficiency and luminosity , the poisson probability is convoluted with the probability distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , assumed to be gaussians .",
    "then the probability of observing a number of events @xmath58 in experiment @xmath59 is : @xmath60 where @xmath61 indicates the sampling of the efficiency with a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath62 and sigma @xmath63 .    in combining two experiments the uncertainties in the efficiencies",
    "are decomposed in two parts : those correlated between the two experiments , and the uncorrelated ones , as indicated above .",
    "the total likelihood for observing a set of events in the two experiments is : @xmath64 with the correlation between the efficiencies taken into account : @xmath65 the likelihood is evaluated with a monte carlo technique  @xcite .",
    "the mean number @xmath66 of events for each experiment is calculated from the relative luminosities and efficiencies , with the latter drawn from gaussian distributions with a common width for the correlated uncertainties , and individual widths for the uncorrelated ones .",
    "the number of observed events @xmath67 for each experiment is drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath66 . by generating a large number of experiments , we calculate the fraction with @xmath67 less or equal to the observed events ( zero in this case ) for the different values of @xmath53 .",
    "the 95% upper limit corresponds to the @xmath53 for which this fraction is @xmath68 0.05 . with the values of the efficiencies discussed above ,",
    "we obtain a 95% cross section limit of 0.0391 pb , which corresponds to a lower mass limit of 241.7 gev for scalar leptoquarks .",
    "this calculation does not take into account backgrounds in each experiment , which in the case of zero observed events is equivalent to a proper background subtraction technique .",
    "limits obtained by the frequentist method are in a good agreement with those from the bayesian prescription .",
    "we performed proper statistical combinations of the d  @xcite and cdf  @xcite limits on the first generation scalar leptoquarks , using both bayesian and frequentist approaches , with common systematic uncertainties taken into account .",
    "the two methods are in a good agreement .",
    "our combined upper 95% cl cross section limit for leptoquark pair production is 38  fb , which corresponds to a lower lq mass limit of 242  gev , based on the lower band of the nlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the cross section limits from both experiments , as well as the combined result , are shown in fig .",
