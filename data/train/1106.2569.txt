    "cdf has recently reported a @xmath10 excess in the @xmath2 event sample in @xmath11  fb@xmath12 of data for dijet invariant masses between @xmath13  gev @xcite .",
    "the excess comprises of hundreds of events in the @xmath14 channel , corresponding to a sizeable cross section , @xmath15  few  pb to account for the smaller leptonic branching fraction and the efficiency of detecting the signal .",
    "several explanations have already appeared @xcite , as well as detailed discussion of the size and shape of the standard model ( sm ) background @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an explanation of this excess invoking pair production of `` quirks '' @xcite , defined below , which subsequently undergo radiative energy loss and weak decay , finally annihilating into dijets .",
    "there are two main pathways that begin with quirk production and end with a @xmath2 signal consistent with the cdf analysis after their cuts : the first path consists of electroweak production of a heavy - light quirk pair , where the heavy quirk @xmath3-decays into a light quirk , emitting a @xmath16 , and then the remaining quirk ",
    "anti - quirk system settles into a quirkonium ground state .",
    "the quirkonium decays into gluon jets that reconstruct an invariant mass peak .",
    "the second path consists of strong production of a heavy quirk - anti - quirk pair , where both quirks @xmath3-decay to their lighter electroweak partners .",
    "even though two @xmath7 bosons are emitted in this process , one @xmath7 decay can be missed by the cdf analysis , particularly when the decay products are light quark jets that have energies below the cdf jet energy cuts .",
    "schematic diagrams of the production and decay of the heavy - light quirk system and the heavy - heavy quirk system is shown in fig .",

    "-decay that can lead to a @xmath2 final state with a dijet invariant mass peak are shown in schematic diagrams .",
    "the top , `` one - armed lobster '' diagram corresponds to weak production @xmath17 , following by charged squirk @xmath3-decay @xmath18 , and finally annihilation of the neutral quirks into a pair of gluons or infragluons ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the bottom , `` two - armed lobster '' diagram corresponds to strong production of a heavy quirk - anti - quirk pair , following by @xmath3-decay of both heavy squirks , and finally annihilation of the neutral quirks into gluons .",

    "the strong coupling scale of the infracolor group , @xmath20 , is assumed to be much smaller than the masses of all quirky ( or squirky ) fields transforming under infracolor .",
    "consequently , infracolor strings do not break , and quirk ( or squirk ) pairs remain in a bound state even when they are produced with high kinetic energies .",
    "this leads to several interesting collider physics , model building and dark matter applications @xcite .",
    "( other work on hidden valley models can be found in @xcite . ) certain kinds of quirks have already been searched for at the tevatron by the d0 collaboration @xcite .",
    "typically , squirks and quirks transform as a vector - like representation of the sm gauge group as well as a vector - like representation of infracolor , and thus can acquire any mass without any additional higgs sector .",
    "here is a summary of our basic strategy to explain the @xmath2 signal , while avoiding the many constraints from lep ii , tevatron , and ua2 :    * we consider squirks ( scalars ) , rather than quirks ( fermions ) , mainly to employ a renormalizable operator to lead to mass splittings , while also minimizing the electroweak precision contribution resulting from this splitting .",
    "* the @xmath2 signal arises from a combination of the two distinct squirk pair production processes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lobsters ] . the weak decay ,",
    "@xmath18 , could be 2-body or 3-body , depending on the mass splitting between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "* all of the squirks are color triplets under qcd .",
    "hence , the leading visible annihilation channel of a squirk  anti - squirk bound state system is into @xmath23 .",
    "this provides our source of the jet - jet resonance , and consequently , we predict the flavor of the jets in the excess observed by cdf to be pure glue with no heavy flavor . * the electrically - neutral squirks are mixtures among the @xmath24 component of an electroweak triplet as well as an electroweak singlet .",
    "hence , they do not couple to the @xmath25 or the @xmath26 .",
    "this implies the tree - level production cross section of the lightest squirks at lep ii vanishes . *",
    "the electrically - charged squirks have masses larger than @xmath27  gev , and so are beyond the lep ii sensitivity . * light squirk pair production @xmath28 results in a dijet invariant mass around @xmath29  gev .",
    "the production cross section is far smaller than tevatron s dijet sensitivity @xcite , making it safe from tevatron searches .",
    "the production cross section of this resonance at the cern spps ( @xmath30  gev ) collider is less than @xmath31  pb per infracolor .",
    "the ua2 bound is roughly @xmath32  pb @xcite , and thus does not restrict @xmath33 .    at this point",
    "we should emphasize that some aspects of squirk production and decay can be calculated or simulated with standard collider tools , but some can not and one must resort to estimates or parameterization of the various possibilities .",
    "what _ can _ be calculated unambiguously is i ) squirk pair production ( at leading order , far from the cross section threshold ) , ii ) the weak decay rate of squirks ( from which we use to infer the weak decay of the squirky mesons ) , and iii ) squirky meson annihilation rates into standard model fields .",
    "what _ can not _ be calculated reliably is the dynamics of the `` spin - down '' process , as the high energy squirks shed their momentum to settle into a ( near ) ground state squirky meson , and the spectrum and content of the resulting radiation .",
    "an attempt at modeling this radiation is underway  @xcite . as a consequence , we do not attempt a full simulation of squirky production .",
    "instead , we calculate quantities that are under control , with estimates of signal efficiencies , and point out where simulations could improve our understanding . to deal with the remaining uncertainties due to non - perturbative infracolor dynamics we discuss some of the possible scenarios for this spin down and their effects on phenomenology in sec .

    "we extend the standard model to include one set of squirks , @xmath34 and @xmath35 with quantum numbers given in table  [ tab : quantumnum ] .",

    "@xmath37 , and @xmath38 can be read off from figs .",
    "[ fig : tevatronweakproduction],[fig : tevatroncoloredproduction ] .",
    "weak production is suppressed by couplings , while the colored production of @xmath38 is enhanced by couplings but further suppressed by kinematics , leading to rates at the tevatron that are roughly comparable .",
    "each model has @xmath39 , such that the infracolor coupling , @xmath40 , is perturbative when evaluated at the mass of the squirk .",
    "the choice @xmath41  gev implies infraglueballs decay well outside the detector , but decay fast enough to not cause cosmological conundrums .",
    "hence , the @xmath42 final state leads to no hard sm particles , and possibly missing energy ( depending on the decay kinematics ) .",
    "the cross sections @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigwjj ] ) and ( [ eq : sigwwjj ] ) respectively .",
    "these cross sections form the starting point for obtaining the @xmath2 signal , as well as several additional signals for which the tevatron has already placed constraints .",
    "we have then estimated the efficiency to detection for three signals : the efficiency for @xmath43 to pass the cdf @xmath2 analysis cuts @xcite , the efficiency for @xmath44 to pass the cdf @xmath2 analysis cuts ( where one @xmath7 s decay products are missed or not energetic enough to pass the cdf cuts ) , and finally , the efficiency for @xmath44 to pass the cdf @xmath45 pre - tag analysis cuts @xcite , which we call @xmath46 .",
    "our estimates are based on a `` stand - in '' model for squirk production and decay , modeled as intermediate resonances with masses the same as @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , allowing for @xmath3-decay into @xmath48 which in turn can @xmath3-decay into @xmath49 .",
    "we have implemented both of these models in madgraph @xcite with various mass splittings .",
    "the modeling of missing energy can not be reliably done , given the squirky spin - down process that can emit infraglueballs which escape the detector as missing energy .    nevertheless , we can implement the various lepton , jet , missing energy and transverse mass cuts on the `` stand in '' model to obtain `` stand in '' efficiencies which should give us a reasonable idea of where the squirk model stands with respect to the various signals after cuts .",
    "both benchmarks lead to some excess in the dileptonic pre - tag @xmath45 sample ( @xmath50 plus missing energy ) , but within the 95% cl limit from cdf .",
    "both benchmarks also lead to between @xmath31-@xmath51 pb of @xmath2 signal , where the range corresponds to including ( not including ) the missing energy and transverse mass cuts for the lower ( upper ) end of the range shown .",
    "also shown in table  [ table : parameters ] is the ratio @xmath52/@xmath53 which corresponds to the fraction of @xmath2 signal after efficiencies that arise from the two - armed lobster versus the one - armed lobster . we conclude that the squirk model we have presented is capable of generating a @xmath2 signal consistent with the cdf excess , so long as the efficiency of detection of squirks is comparable to our `` stand in '' model for event - level simulation .",
    "while we have presented estimates for a variety of observables above , we emphasize that several quantities should be taken as rough estimates due to the various uncertainties involving quirky dynamics .",
    "for example , the uncertainty on the timescale of energy loss can strongly affect the branching fractions between spin - down and @xmath3-decay as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cntol ] and [ fig : cctol ] .",
    "in addition , squirks that rapidly lose energy often reach the @xmath54 ground states , which have definite masses , and so leads to features in kinematic distributions . even when energy loss is rapid , the choice between branchings involving @xmath3-decay ( such as @xmath2 and @xmath52 ) versus annihilation channels ( such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) is sensitive to the uncertainty in the wavefunction at the origin for quirkonium states .",
    "we have demonstrated that the @xmath2 signal observed by cdf can be obtained from a model of squirks without violating existing collider bounds .",
    "there are two qualitative regimes where the signal arises :    * rapid spin - down , then squirky @xmath3-decay or annihilation . in this scenario ,",
    "the excess energy squirks carry , @xmath55 , is released quickly , allowing the squirk pair production to settle into squirkonium .",
    "this could happen because @xmath3-decay is suppressed , or could happen if the energy loss is rapid , or both .",
    "+ a competition is set up between @xmath3-decay of the squirkonium constituent squirks versus direct annihilation of the squirks . in this regime ,",
    "several interesting squirkonium decay modes with invariant mass resonances are potential confirmation signals , including @xmath23 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath42 ( invisible ) , and possibly @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and signals with a higgs boson .",
    "* rapid @xmath3-decay , then spin - down , then annihilation . in this regime ,",
    "the only squirkonium state that is reached is @xmath49 , yielding the famous jet - jet resonance .",
    "this could happen if @xmath3-decay is comparatively fast , or could happen if energy loss is comparatively slow , or both .",
    "+ in this regime , every heavy squirk @xmath3-decay yields a ( possibly off - shell ) @xmath7 , giving many signals with multi-@xmath7 s plus a jet - jet resonance .",
    "the two regimes share several interesting signals including the @xmath2 final state .",
    "interestingly , neither regime contains an associated @xmath6 or @xmath5 signal , which is characteristic of this model .",
    "we emphasize that while squirk production and squirk @xmath3-decay rates can be calculated perturbatively , the `` spin - down '' or energy loss phase , as well as the squirkonium decay rates have substantial uncertainties .",
    "the relative branching fractions of squirkonium can in some cases be determined , since the decay rate dependence on the wave function at the origin drops out . but determining which of energy loss or @xmath3-decay is more rapid can merely be estimated .",
    "the kinematics of the two regimes to @xmath2 are qualitatively distinct .",
    "in particular , if the second term dominates one would expect an invariant mass peak for the whole @xmath2 system , and an edge in the transverse mass distribution , while if the second dominates such features would be either absent , or less pronounced .",
    "cdf have presented interesting distributions @xcite , but we leave the investigation of such kinematic features for future work .    we have calculated the lhc production cross sections of the squirks in the parameter ranges relevant to this model .",
    "we find that the electroweak production of charged plus neutral squirks is relatively small , typically a few pb . the colored production of squirks is , not surprising , quite large  of order hundreds of pb !",
    "the lhc production of @xmath59 seems particularly important , since depending on which regime we are in , it can yield signal rates into the annihilation modes [ regime 1 ] or the multi-@xmath7 production [ regime 2 ] .",
    "there are several associated signals of our model that we have not discussed .",
    "squirks have nontrivial interactions with the higgs boson through the dimension-4 operator , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim4 ] ) .",
    "loops of squirks modify the effective @xmath60 coupling as well as @xmath61 . since @xmath62 receives its mass from both electroweak preserving , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vectormass ] ) and electroweak breaking eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim4 ] ) , the contribution will scale as @xmath63 .    in this paper",
    "we have focused mainly on a quirky explanation for the cdf @xmath2 excess , but in the process we have illustrated many interesting signals of quirk or squirk production at colliders . with the tevatron hints of new physics , combined with the wonderful prospects at lhc , we expect an exciting time in quirky physics .",
    "_ note added : _ just before this paper was completed , d0 reported an analysis of their @xmath2 data , finding `` no evidence for anomalous resonant dijet production '' @xcite",
    ". taken at face value , their analysis sets an upper bound of @xmath64  pb at 95% cl for resonant dijet production near the invariant mass window of the cdf excess , and thus does not rule out a new physics explanation of the cdf excess with a cross section less than this value .",
    "given that the d0 analysis was done with lower luminosity ( @xmath65  fb@xmath12 @xcite versus @xmath11  fb@xmath12 @xcite ) , without an inclusive ( 2 or more jets ) analysis ( unlike @xcite ) , we remain skeptical of drawing negative conclusions until the joint task force @xcite completes their analysis .",
    "the introduction of the higgs operator at dimension-4 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim4 ] ) , splits the masses of the fields within the triplet @xmath66 .",
    "this isospin violation leads to modifications to electroweak precision data .",
    "the correction to @xmath67 , which characterizes @xmath68 mixing induced by electroweak symmetry breaking , vanishes here since the squirks transform in electroweak representations with zero hypercharge .",

    "<S> we consider the physics and collider phenomenology of quirks that transform nontrivially under qcd color , @xmath0 as well as an @xmath1 infracolor group . our main motivation is to show that the recent @xmath2 excess observed by cdf naturally arises in quirky models . </S>",
    "<S> the basic pattern is that several different quirky states can be produced , some of which @xmath3-decay during or after spin - down , leaving the lightest electrically neutral quirks to hadronize into a meson that subsequently decays into gluon jets . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze lep ii , tevatron , ua2 , and electroweak precision constraints , identifying the simplest viable models : scalar quirks ( `` squirks '' ) transforming as color triplets , @xmath0 triplets and singlets , all with vanishing hypercharge . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate production cross sections , weak decay , spin - down , meson decay rates , and estimate efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> the novel features of our quirky model includes : quirkonium decay proceeds into a pair of gluon jets , without a @xmath4-jet component ; there is essentially no associated @xmath5 or @xmath6 signal ; and there are potentially new ( parameter - dependent ) contributions to dijet production , multi-@xmath7 production plus jets , @xmath8 , @xmath9 resonance signals , and monojet signals . </S>",
    "<S> there may be either underlying event from low energy qcd deposition resulting from quirky spin - down , and/or qualitatively modified event kinematics from infraglueball emission . </S>"
