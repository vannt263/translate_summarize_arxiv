    "this notes represent the written version of lectures i gave in mini - courses at universidade de braslia ( april 3 - 6 , 2013 ) , universidad central de venezuela ( may 23 - 27 , 2016 ) and at the villa de leyva summer school `` geometric , topological and algebraic methods for quantum field theory '' ( july 15 - 27 , 2013 ) .",
    "they were mainly intended as an introduction to some aspects of operator algebras , emphasizing the prominent role they play in quantum physics . as the audience consisted of students of both physics and mathematics at different stages of their studies ,",
    "my choice was to focus on the most basic structures and examples , in the hope that a good grasp of these would motivate them to go deeper into the subject .",
    "now , something that to a physicist may appear as completely familiar ( as , say , an experimental set - up with polarizers , or the distinction between a classical and a quantum field ) to a mathematician may not",
    ". the same could be said of the proof that the spectrum of any element in a @xmath0-algebra is never empty : it is a standard result in analysis , but may look quite awkward to many physics students .",
    "therefore , the emphasis of these lecture notes will be on explaining _ why _ certain mathematical structures may be useful for the study of quantum theory .",
    "this will be illustrated by means of several examples that include a discussion of bipartite entanglement , algebraic and geometric aspects of quantum phase transitions in spin chains , quasi - free states in fermionic systems and applications to quantum field theory .",
    "our starting point will be based on the sharp distinction between _ classical probability _ and the probability theory inherent to quantum mechanics .",
    "this will provide a physical motivation to the various mathematical concepts we will be dealing with . after introducing the basic concepts about @xmath0-algebras",
    ", we will show how an algebraic approach to entanglement can lead to a resolution of certain discrepancies appearing when we deal with systems of identical particles .",
    "then we will focus on the study of certain specific models ( quantum ising and xy models ) that turn out to be ideal in order to illustrate how entanglement , geometry and the theory of car algebras - algebras used to model fermionic systems ] are interrelated .",
    "our first objective will be to understand what are the main structural differences between _ classical _ and _ quantum _ physics , when regarded as probability theories .",
    "this will , by the way , provide a physical motivation for some of the mathematical notions we will consider in the next sections .",
    "let us recall that classical physics is usually modeled on a configuration ( or phase ) space , with a dynamics governed by , _",
    "e.g. _ , hamilton s principle . on the other hand , quantum mechanics",
    "is modeled on a hilbert space .",
    "so the first issue we want to explore is : why do we have to use quantum mechanics to describe the microscopic world ? indeed ,",
    "simple experiments with light polarizers make it clear that there is no way we can describe certain phenomena using classical physics or , better said , classical _",
    "probability_. let us then explore some elementary polarization phenomena , following the presentation in  @xcite .",
    "first let us recall that light is just made of electromagnetic waves , their behavior being governed by maxwell s equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) stands for the electric ( resp . magnetic ) field , @xmath4 for the charge density and @xmath5 for the current density .",
    "[ ex : intro1 ] show that maxwell s equations ( [ eq : intro - maxwell ] ) in vacuum ( @xmath6 ) lead to plane - wave solutions for the electromagnetic field propagating at a speed @xmath7 and such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are always perpendicular to each other and to the propagation direction . what is the relation between the _ intensity _ of the wave ( defined as @xmath8 ) and the energy content of the fields ?    in simple terms , a _",
    "polarizer _ is a filter that only allows the transmission of light waves which have a specific polarization angle .",
    "if we let unpolarized light go through an ideal polarizer , the intensity @xmath9 of the transmitted wave will be found to be half the intensity @xmath10 of the incident wave : @xmath11 ( malus law ) . after passing through the polarizer ,",
    "the light is said to be linearly polarized .",
    "let us now suppose that we have a beam of linearly polarized light and we let it go through a second polarizer , such that its polarization axis has been rotated by an angle @xmath12 with respect to the axis of the first polarizer .",
    "then , experiment tells us that the intensity of the transmitted light will be @xmath13 .",
    "this is all fine if we are working with classical electromagnetic waves , which are described by maxwell s equations . in this case",
    "we just need to consider the projection of the field onto the direction singled out by the polarization axis .",
    "but we know that light is actually made of photons and , if their number is small , we are led to regard the @xmath14 term as a kind of `` expectation value '' .    in a very influential paper",
    "@xcite , einstein , podolski and rosen presented a criticism of quantum theory in what is now known as the _ epr paradox_. this led to the development of alternative , so - called ",
    "hidden variable \" theories that aimed at explaining physical phenomena using classical probability models .",
    "it was only until bell proved his famous inequalities , and aspect s experiments proved the former were violated , that the controversy could be resolved , showing that quantum theory provided the correct description of the phenomena .",
    "an experimental set - up , of the type studied by aspect , consists of a source ( ca atom ) located in the middle that emits simultaneously a pair of photons .",
    "one of them goes to the right , the other to the left .",
    "there are two detectors , one at each extreme .",
    "there is also a polarizer in - between each detector and the source , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro - ca - atom ] .    , @xmath15 ) .",
    "there is a polarizer between the ca atom and each of the detectors . ]",
    "let us now consider the following two propositions : + @xmath16``left photon passes through ( is detected by @xmath17 ) when polarizer s angle is @xmath12 '' .",
    "+ @xmath18``right photon passes through ( is detected by @xmath15 ) when polarizer s angle is @xmath19 '' .",
    "+ then , what we learn from experiment is that the _ joint probability _ for both photons passing through the polarizers , thus being detected , is @xmath20 before exploring why classical probability is in conflict with this result , let us recall how the principles of quantum mechanics allow us to predict it .",
    "let @xmath21 denote a hilbert space which , for simplicity , will be considered to be finite dimensional . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "probability distributions are obtained from state vectors @xmath22 or , more generally , by density matrices @xmath4 , that is , self - adjoint positive operators of trace one .",
    "on the other hand , observables are described by self - adjoint operators .",
    "let @xmath23 be such an observable .",
    "let @xmath24 denote its spectrum .",
    "we can then consider its spectral decomposition @xmath25 if the state of the system is given by a density matrix @xmath4 , the _ expectation value _ of @xmath23 is defined as @xmath26 in the case of a _ pure _ state , the density matrix is a rank - one projector , of the form @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and so ( [ eq : intro < a > ] ) reduces to @xmath29 . in this way",
    "we obtain a probability distribution over @xmath30 , with @xmath31 in fact , it follows from ( [ eq : intro - speca ] ) and ( [ eq : intro < a > ] ) that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "let us use this to give a mathematical description of the experiment described above .",
    "the polarization state of a photon can be described using a 2-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath34 denote an orthonormal basis , that can be used to describe , say , horizontal and vertical polarization states .",
    "since we are considering a system consisting of two photons , the hilbert space of the system can be taken to be @xmath35 ( as the photons are supposed to be far from each other at the time of detection , the symmetrization postulate can be ignored ) .",
    "the 2-photon state , as produced by the emission from an excited state of the ca atom , can be described by the following state vector : @xmath36 we can use @xmath37 , defined as the _ projector _ onto @xmath38 .",
    "since we have two polarizers , we introduce the following projectors ( _ cf . _ fig .",
    "[ fig : intro - ca - atom ] ) : @xmath39 it is important to remark that these two operators correspond to compatible observables , in the sense that the measurement of one of them does not affect the result of the other , _ i.e. _ , they are commuting observables : @xmath40=0.\\ ] ]    show that @xmath41 also show that , for the _ joint _ measurement of the two polarization states , one obtains @xmath42    the previous exercise shows that the predictions of quantum mechanics for this type of experiment are in accordance with what is actually measured in the laboratory . in spite of its extreme simplicity , there is an intriguing feature of this result : by appropriately arranging the polarization angles @xmath19 and @xmath12 , we can obtain a _ total anticorrelation _ for the joint measurements . as we will see , this is due to the fact that the state ( [ eq : intro-2-photon - state ] ) is an _ entangled state_. that these kind of correlations can not be obtained from a ( local , realistic ) classical theory is at the core of the original epr controversy . for an interesting discussion of these issues in the context of an actual experimental situation , we recommend  @xcite .",
    "our immediate aim will therefore be to understand where exactly classical probability fails at describing the results of such experiments .",
    "for this purpose we will assume an approach to ( classical ) probability based on propositions and degrees of plausibility , following jaynes  @xcite .    in this setting ,",
    "the objects to be considered are the following :    * a set of propositions : @xmath43 , each one of which can take on ( only ) two values : true or false . * logical operations , that can be performed on the set of propositions : * * conjunction , or logical product ( and ) : @xmath44 .",
    "it is true if and only if both @xmath23 and @xmath3 true . * * disjunction , or logical sum ( or ) : @xmath45 .",
    "it is true if at least one of them true .",
    "* * negation ( not ) : @xmath46 , with opposite truth value as @xmath23 .",
    "these logical operations are assumed to satisfy the defining rules of a _",
    "boolean algebra _ :    * idempotency : @xmath47 * commutativity : @xmath48 * associativity : * * @xmath49 * * @xmath50 * distributivity : * * @xmath51 * * @xmath52 * duality ( de morgan s laws ) : @xmath53    show that the proposition `` @xmath54 '' is equivalent to `` @xmath55 '' .",
    "show that ( d2 ) follows from the other rules .",
    "now , given a proposition @xmath23 , a probability ( or `` degree of plausibility '' , _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) @xmath56 can be assigned to it , under the following basic assumptions :    * let @xmath57 denote the probability , or degree of plausibility , of a given proposition @xmath23 .",
    "then we assume that : * * @xmath58 , for any logical function @xmath59 of the propositions @xmath60 * * using the notation @xmath61 for the conditional probability that @xmath23 is true , given @xmath3 is true , we assume that @xmath62 whenever @xmath63 more plausible than @xmath64 .",
    "* given a proposition @xmath65 , let us suppose that we improve our state of knowledge , obtaining a new proposition @xmath66 .",
    "if as a result @xmath23 becomes _ more _ plausible , _ i.e. _ @xmath67 , but @xmath68 , then @xmath69 should hold ( this is dubbed the _ common sense _ assumption by jaynes  @xcite )",
    ".    from i and ii above we may obtain , under very general assumptions ( like consistency ) , the following two basic rules :    * product rule:@xmath70 * sum rule : @xmath71    the reader is invited to consult jaynes for a comprehensive exposition of this point of view , including many illustrative derivations and examples .",
    "now , in order to return to our experiment , let us define the following `` coincidence '' function @xmath59 , for two given propositions @xmath23 and @xmath3 : @xmath72    given 4 propositions @xmath73 , use the product and sum rules to show that the following proposition is true : @xmath74    since @xmath75 whenever @xmath54 holds ( product rule ) we obtain , from the previous exercise , + `` bell s inequality '' : @xmath76 referring back to figure [ fig : intro - ca - atom ] , let us consider the following propositions ( @xmath77 ) : + @xmath78 `` left photon passes through ( is detected by @xmath17 ) when polarizer s angle is @xmath79 '' .",
    "+ @xmath80 `` right photon passes through ( is detected by @xmath15 ) when polarizer s angle is @xmath81 '' .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : intro - bell - chsh ] ) should hold true for all choices of @xmath82 . but",
    "this then implies : @xmath83 for the choice @xmath84 , this means : @xmath85    @xmath86 @xmath87 this contradiction means that the assumptions we have considered above ( which are at the basis of classical probability ) do not apply in the quantum realm .",
    "so , definitely , quantum theory leads to a very different type of probability theory .",
    "in the next section we will explore some of the more notorious differences between classical and quantum probabilities .",
    "until now we have avoided any mention of propositions in terms of set theory , which is the basis of the kolmogorov axiomatics . in the finite dimensional case , at least , they turn out to give equivalent structures .",
    "let us then consider the main properties of a ( classical ) probability theory , formulated in terms of set theory and , for simplicity , in the finite dimensional context .",
    "let us consider a finite set @xmath88 , regarded here as the _ sample space_. the _ event space _",
    "@xmath89 is a certain collection of subsets of @xmath90 , that must contain the empty set and be closed under complements and unions .",
    "the set of events forms a boolean algebra , under the standard set theoretic operations :    * and : @xmath91 , * or : @xmath92 , * not : @xmath93 .    a probability distribution",
    "is then defined as a map @xmath94\\subset \\mathds r$ ] , such that    * @xmath95 @xmath96 , * @xmath97 for @xmath98 pairwise disjoint .",
    "notice that the space of probability distributions is a convex set , for if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are two probability distributions , then @xmath101 is again a probability distribution , provided @xmath102 .",
    "but not only is the space of probability distributions a convex set , it is a special kind of convex set : a _ simplex_. to see this , all we have to do is to consider the following `` extremal '' distributions , @xmath103 , defined by @xmath104 it is clear that any @xmath105 can be written as a _",
    "unique _ convex combination of these extremal distributions , as we have @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "a random variable ( or `` observable '' ) is a function @xmath108 .",
    "we call the space of all such functions @xmath109 .",
    "notice that @xmath109 forms a commutative algebra .",
    "summarizing , in the finite - dimensional case we have the following structure :    * the event space ( @xmath110 ) forms a boolean algebra . *",
    "the space of probability distributions is _ convex _ and furthermore has the structure of a simplex : every probability distribution @xmath105 can be uniquely written as convex combination of  extremal \" distributions . *",
    "the space of observables ( random variables ) has the structure of a commutative algebra .    in cases where the sample space is",
    "not a finite set ( like in classical mechanics ) we need a suitable generalization of the above definitions .",
    "this is afforded by measure theory , in the following way : sample and event spaces are now replaced by a measurable space @xmath111 , where @xmath89 is a suitable @xmath112-algebra of @xmath90 .",
    "probability distributions are then defined as _ normalized , positive measures_. in particular , we can now handle countable additivity : @xmath113 finally , the space of observables is still a commutative algebra , for the product and sum of two measurable functions is a measurable function .",
    "a similar remark applies to the convex structure of the space of probability distributions .",
    "how do these structures show up in classical physics ?",
    "in classical mechanics , for example , the dynamics of a system can be described in terms of canonical variables `` position '' ( @xmath114 ) and `` momentum '' ( @xmath115 ) , that give rise to the _ phase space _ of the system .",
    "it follows from hamilton s variational principle that if @xmath116 is the hamiltonian of the system , the canonical variables will evolve along solutions to hamilton s equations : @xmath117 usually the phase space is the cotangent bundle @xmath118 of some configuration space @xmath119 .",
    "the canonical variables @xmath120 are then local coordinates on @xmath118 and the _ observables _ are smooth functions on phase space : @xmath121 .",
    "since time evolution is given by hamilton s equations or , at the level of observables by @xmath122 , with @xmath123 denoting the poisson bracket , one would think that there is no much space for a probabilistic model here since , given a set of initial conditions , by solving the equations of motion we are able , in principle , to predict the position and momenta of all the particles .",
    "but , as we learn from classical statistical physics , for @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) we certainly need a statistical approach ! therefore we are forced to introduce probability distributions , expressed in terms of probability densities @xmath126 , so that the average value of an observable @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the liouville measure on phase space .",
    "for instance , for the _ canonical ensemble _",
    "( used to describe a subsystem embedded in a thermal bath at temperature @xmath130 ) , we have @xmath131 .",
    "now we can return to the case of a few point particles and interpret the state of the system at a given time , usually defined as just a point @xmath132 in phase space , as an extremal probability distribution ( a `` pure state '' ) , for which the probability density is just a dirac delta distribution : @xmath133 . in any case",
    ", we see that classical physics can be regarded as a special type of probability theory , where the three properties of classical probability highlighted above still hold , _",
    "i.e. _ , every classical system of point particles can be understood as a probability theory , in the kolmogorov sense .    what about quantum mechanics ?",
    "as discussed above , probability distributions are obtained from state vectors @xmath134 in a hilbert space @xmath21 , or more generally from density matrices , @xmath4 , whereas observables are described by self - adjoint operators .",
    "consider the spectral decomposition of a self - adjoint operator @xmath23 , as in ( [ eq : intro - speca ] ) . assuming a non - degenerate , discrete spectrum",
    ", we notice that the projectors @xmath135 , having as spectrum the set @xmath136 , can be regarded as `` indicators of events '' .",
    "now , there is a correspondence between projections @xmath137 and subspaces @xmath138 .",
    "the partial order that we naturally obtain by inclusion then gives rise to the structure of an `` orthocomplemented lattice of proposition '' , where the corresponding operations are defined as @xmath139 an important feature of this system is that it _ does not _ give rise to a boolean algebra structure .",
    "the reason for this is that the orthogonal complement is not the only possibility for a complement in this lattice .",
    "this in turn implies the breakdown of the distributive law , which is part of the definition of a boolean algebra . as in the classical case ,",
    "the state space ( here the space of density matrices ) is a convex space .",
    "but , in contrast to the classical case , this space is not a simplex .",
    "a consequence of this is that the representation of a density matrix as a convex sum of pure states is ( highly ) non - unique . finally , in quantum theory",
    "the space of observables forms a non - commutative algebra , in contrast to the classical case , where the algebra is commutative .",
    "it is now clear that , in principle , both approaches ( classical and quantum ) can be considered in order to describe physical phenomena in probabilistic terms .",
    "in fact , epr - like arguments are in favor of a `` local - realistic '' point of view according to which even quantum phenomena should be explained in terms of classical probability . that this is not the case is proved by bell s inequalities and their violation , experimentally verified by aspect in the 80 s .",
    "so quantum theory can be regarded as a kind of `` non - commutative '' probability theory .",
    "one of the points of these lectures is that , when formulated in the language of operator algebras , both quantum and classical physics can be described in a unified way .",
    "we will also take advantage of this formulation to discuss a similar phenomenon , occurring in topology and geometry : in non - commutative geometry  @xcite the generalization of topological / geometric notions to the non - commutative setting has been mainly achieved by first expressing them in algebraic terms and then realizing that dropping the commutativity assumption allows for vast generalizations .",
    "let @xmath21 be a separable hilbert space . recall that",
    ", given a linear operator @xmath140 , @xmath130 is said to be bounded if there is some @xmath141 such that @xmath142 for all @xmath143 in @xmath21 , where the norm is the one induced by the inner product : @xmath144 . if @xmath130 is a bounded operator , we define its norm as follows : @xmath145{\\mbox{sup } } { } \\frac{\\|t(x)\\|}{\\|x\\|}.\\ ] ] one then checks that for @xmath130 and @xmath146 bounded the inequalities @xmath147 are satisfied . from the completeness of @xmath21",
    "it follows that the space @xmath148 is a complete normed space .",
    "it is also an algebra and has an involution `` @xmath149 '' given by the adjoint : @xmath150 .",
    "we thus may call @xmath151 the `` @xmath149-algebra of bounded operators on @xmath21 ''    show that for @xmath152 we have : @xmath153    we now abstract these notions and make them independent of any underlying hilbert space . as we will see below",
    ", a lot will be gained from this , since we will then be able to study _ representations _ of the ( abstract ) operator algebras , and the equivalence / inequivalence of these representations will have a deep physical meaning .",
    "a _ banach space _ is a normed vector space @xmath154 which is complete with respect to the ( metric induced by ) @xmath155 .",
    "a _ banach algebra _ is a banach space @xmath156 which is also an algebra , with the property that @xmath157 ( which in turn implies that multiplication is a continuous operation ) .",
    "an _ involution _ on a ( complex ) algebra @xmath158 is a map @xmath159 such that , for any @xmath160 and @xmath161 :    * @xmath162 * @xmath163 * @xmath164    notice that this is , basically , an abstraction of the adjoint operation on @xmath151 .    a _",

    "then , as we expect , @xmath173 is a @xmath0-algebra , where the norm is the operator norm and the involution is given by the adjoint operation .",
    "later we will see that the list of examples of @xmath0-algebras is basically exhausted by the previous two examples , a remarkable fact . a motivation to work with algebras of bounded operators",
    "comes from physics since , as can be shown , the _ canonical commutation relations _",
    "( ccr ) @xmath174 = i\\hbar \\mathds 1\\ ] ] can not be implemented by means of bounded operators @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "then , although these commutation relations have a very clear meaning from the physical point of view , mathematically they correspond to _ unbounded _ operators and hence issues like self - adjointness , domains , etc .",
    "come into play , which make them more difficult to deal with .",
    "one can , nevertheless , replace the ccr by their exponentiated ( or weyl ) form , as follows .",
    "first we define operators @xmath177 and @xmath178 , for @xmath179 , acting on wave functions as follows : @xmath180 by stone s theorem , it follows that @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "[ ex : weyl - ccr ] show that the operators @xmath177 and @xmath178 satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath183    as we will see later on , these operators give rise to a @xmath0-algebra .",
    "in fact , we will see that to any symplectic vector space we can canonically associate a @xmath0-algebra ( its weyl @xmath0-algebra ) .",
    "the unitary representations of these algebras , in the case of infinite dimensional symplectic vector spaces , play a prominent role in the study of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes .    consider a ( complex , involutive , with unit @xmath184 ) algebra @xmath158 generated by elements @xmath185 , subject to the following _ canonical anticommutation relations ( car ) _ : @xmath186 if we want to define a @xmath0 norm on this algebra , it has to be such that the @xmath0-property ( [ eq : basics - cstar - ppty ] ) is satisfied . but from ( [ eq : basics - car1 ] ) we obtain @xmath187 , which along with ( [ eq : basics - cstar - ppty ] ) implies @xmath188 .",
    "the only option we have , then , is to define @xmath189 for every @xmath190 .",

    "consider a physical system modeled by the algebra @xmath198 of bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in physics we distinguish between two kinds of states :    * pure states : these are described by normalized vectors @xmath28 ( actually , by rays on hilbert space ) .",

    "it must be possible , then , to express the properties @xmath207 and @xmath202 only in terms of this mapping .",

    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] the schwinger term is a cocycle that gives an obstruction for @xmath934 to be a lie algebra homomorphism .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , the schwinger term is related to anomalies in quantum field theory and also to noncommutative geometry .",
    "it appears naturally when studying the virasoro algebra , and therefore is also related to the notion of _ central charge _ in conformal field theory .",
    "as we have seen , central charges do also appear when we study entanglement entropy in spin chains that display critical behavior .",
    "our aim in the next section is to give an idea of how all these concepts are interrelated .",
    "this will allow us to close the circle by providing a new topological interpretation of quantum criticality , for which the underlying geometry is not anymore the geometry of the space of external parameters , but a geometry in the sense of noncommutative geometry .",
    "this geometric interpretation of anomalies , central charges , schwinger cocycles _ etc .",
    "_ , has been known for several decades ( to the best of my knowledge the first person to realize this was araki  @xcite ) .",
    "but the connection to _ quantum critical phenomena _ does not seem to have been exploited .",
    "previously in these notes we discussed the gelfand - naimark theorem , which serves as a motivation for the notion of a noncommutative space .",
    "it turns out that the schwinger term described in the previous section also has a nice geometric interpretation , in the context of noncommutative geometry  @xcite . in order to give at least a glimpse of how this interpretation appears we will present , following  @xcite , a very basic ( yet instructive ) example , namely the gauss - bonnet theorem , in the language of noncommutative geometry . but",
    "before that we quickly review some aspects of the geometry of surfaces , following the beautiful presentation of the subject by pressley  @xcite .",
    "we thus start with a given 2-dimensional surface , described locally through a parametrization @xmath935 at each point , the tangent plane is generated by @xmath936 and @xmath937 and we can define the normal unit vector as @xmath938 the infinitesimal length element on the surface is given by @xmath939 where @xmath940 are the components of the _ first fundamental form _ : @xmath941 recall that the first and second fundamental forms enter the definition of gaussian curvature of a surface , which we now recall , starting from the curvature of a curve . for a plane curve , parametrized by @xmath942 with unit speed ( @xmath943 ) ,",
    "let @xmath944 denote the unit normal at @xmath945 .",
    "then the ( signed ) curvature @xmath946 is defined through the relation @xmath947 .",
    "the curvature gives us an idea of how much the curve deviates from a straight line  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we may compute @xmath948    now we repeat the same reasoning , but with a surface .",
    "that is , we want to compute @xmath949 , where now @xmath810 denotes the unit normal to the surface . from a second order taylor expansion and using the fact that @xmath950 , we get @xmath951 where @xmath952 , @xmath953 and @xmath954 are the coefficients of the _ second fundamental form _ : @xmath955 now , for any smooth curve @xmath698 we have a decomposition of the form @xmath956 where @xmath957 and @xmath958 denote , respectively , the _ normal _ and _ geodesic _ curvatures of @xmath698 . to define the curvature of the surface we need to consider only curves with @xmath959 , for which the normal curvature takes the form @xmath960 the value of @xmath957 changes depending on the direction of the curve at the evaluation point , and it is clear it must attain maximum and minimum values .",
    "they are the _ principal curvatures _",
    ", denoted as @xmath961 and @xmath962 .",
    "the gaussian curvature is defined as @xmath963 .",
    "we can obtain several useful formulas for the curvature using the fundamental forms .",
    "the principal curvatures @xmath961 and @xmath962 are obtained from an extremization problem , where we look for extremal values of the principal curvature as we change the direction of the curve -given by @xmath964- subject to the unit - speed restriction @xmath965 .",
    "so , with @xmath966 , @xmath967 , we want to extremize @xmath968 subject to the restriction @xmath969 .",
    "but we also have @xmath970    solve the extremization problem posed above , subject to the constraint @xmath969 , and show that the solution is given by the solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath971 where the eigenvalue @xmath229 is the lagrange multiplier of the problem .",
    "show furthermore that , for a given solution @xmath972 , the corresponding normal curvature coincides precisely with @xmath229 and conclude that the gaussian curvature can be expressed as follows : @xmath973    there are other ways we can characterize @xmath690 .",
    "one of them uses the gauss map : for any point @xmath105 in the surface , consider the unit normal , @xmath974 .",
    "regarding this vector as a point in the unit sphere , we obtain a map @xmath975 from the surface to the unit sphere , the gauss map .",
    "as we go around a small loop centered at @xmath105 , the gauss map produces an image loop on the unit sphere .",
    "the quotient of the areas enclosed by the loops converges , in the limit where the original loop shrinks to a point , to the gaussian curvature . yet",
    "another way to obtain the gaussian curvature is by means of the _",
    "weingarten map_. first notice that we have @xmath976 , @xmath977 and @xmath978 .",
    "this can be easily checked ; for instance , the first relation is obtained by taking the partial derivative of @xmath979 with respect to @xmath267 .",
    "the others are obtained in the same way .",
    "the weingarten map @xmath980 is most easily defined in the basis @xmath981 , where it has a matrix given by @xmath982 .",
    "in fact , if we define @xmath983 and write @xmath984 then it follows that @xmath985 now we compute @xmath986 from which the following identity is obtained : @xmath987 now , as the components of the unit normal @xmath988 are smooth functions of @xmath989 , we can compute their exterior derivatives @xmath990 in order to obtain @xmath991 this leads to the following formula for the euler characteristic : @xmath992 this formula is particularly well suited to explain the noncommutative viewpoint , to which we now turn , following the example presented by connes in  @xcite .",
    "let us consider an algebra @xmath158 ( without assuming other properties , for the moment being ) together with a trilinear map @xmath993 such that @xmath994 and @xmath995 now let @xmath996 be a ( continuous ) family of idempotents , @xmath997",
    ". then it can be shown that the quantity @xmath998 does not depend on @xmath999 , providing an `` invariant '' of the algebra . a quick way to see what is going on",
    "is to assume that we can differentiate with respect to @xmath999 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath1000,\\nonumber\\ ] ] with @xmath1001 $ ] .",
    "using this fact and ( [ eq : cond(i ) ] ) , we obtain @xmath1002 , e_t , e_t).\\nonumber\\ ] ] but the last expression vanishes exactly . to see this , we put @xmath1003 and @xmath1004 in ( [ eq : cond(ii ) ] ) and use @xmath1005 .",
    "now , coming back to gauss - bonnet , if we take the algebra to be @xmath1006 , we see that the trilinear map @xmath1007 satisfies ( [ eq : cond(i ) ] ) and ( [ eq : cond(ii ) ] ) above , provided @xmath1008 .",
    "but , as explained in  @xcite , in this algebra there are no interesting idempotents",
    ". this can be remedied by adding a  bit of noncommutativity \" to this algebra , that is , by replacing it by the following one : @xmath1009 now , recalling the gauss map , we realize that we can use the normal to the surface in order to obtain an idempotent , namely @xmath1010 where @xmath1011 , a `` vector '' whose components are the pauli matrices .",
    "then , if we define -following  @xcite- @xmath1012 we obtain ( an algebraic version of ) the euler characteristic .",
    "what we learn from the previous example is that it seems plausible to encode geometry and topology in algebraic structures related to a manifold @xmath167 .",
    "this is precisely the way noncommutative geometry works . after establishing such algebraic and operator - theoretic characterization of certain geometric or topological structures , one can try to keep the algebraic version , but now dropping the commutativity assumption . such is the case with differential calculus .",
    "let us then quickly list the main properties of de rham cohomology and see whether they can be formulated for more general algebras .",
    "given a compact manifold @xmath167 , the space of 1-forms @xmath1015 consists of elements of the form @xmath1016 , where @xmath59 and @xmath508 are smooth functions on @xmath167 , and @xmath1017 is the exterior derivative of @xmath508 .",
    "differential forms of order @xmath453 , @xmath1018 , are generated locally by expressions of the form @xmath1019 so that , in general , the exterior derivative @xmath1020 can be defined through @xmath1021 .",
    "the exterior derivative satisfies the leibniz rule @xmath1022 and fulfills the basic identity @xmath1023 , from which we obtain the ( de rham ) cohomology `` groups '' : @xmath1024 that contain important information about the topology of @xmath167 .",
    "finally , we also have stoke s theorem : @xmath1025 now suppose we are given a unital algebra @xmath158 .",
    "thinking of it as given by some space of functions on a `` virtual '' ( _ i.e. _ noncommutative ) space , we may try to define a differential calculus satisfying properties as close as possible to the ones recalled above .",
    "one possible construction goes as follows  @xcite :    in order to define the space of 1-forms , we consider the map @xmath1026 defined as @xmath1027 .",
    "its usefulness comes from the fact that it acts as a derivation : @xmath1028 but @xmath1029 is `` too big '' to be regarded as a space of 1-forms .",
    "we want to have a closer resemblance to @xmath1015 .",
    "recalling that 1-forms can always be put in the form @xmath1030 , we consider the restriction to the subspace of @xmath1029 generated by elements of the form @xmath1031 . noticing that @xmath1032 we arrive at the following definition : @xmath1033 where @xmath1034 is the multiplication map @xmath1035 .",
    "then , starting from @xmath1036 we can go on and define @xmath1037 for @xmath1038 .",
    "the exterior derivative , then , is simply given by @xmath1039 from these definitions we get , as can be easily checked :      this means that in any complex algebra we can find an analog of the space of differential forms ( _ i.e. _ , a graded differential algebra ) .",
    "the importance of this construction lies in the fact that it satisfies a universal property , as any derivation of @xmath158 into a bimodule factors through a bimodule morphism from @xmath1042 .",
    "we also want to have a notion of integration . in this context",
    "this is achieved through the introduction of _ cycles_. an @xmath810-dimensional cycle is a complex graded differential algebra ( @xmath1043 ) , along with an `` integral '' , _",
    "i.e. _ a linear map @xmath1044 , such that : @xmath1045 the third requirement is tantamount to stokes theorem for the case of spaces without boundary .",
    "now , given an algebra @xmath158 , a _ cycle _ over @xmath158 is a cycle @xmath1046 together with a homomorphism @xmath1047  @xcite .",
    "a basic example is afforded by the de rham complex on a compact manifold without boundary .    given a cycle over",
    "@xmath158 we may now define , for @xmath1048 , @xmath1049 as shown in  @xcite , this map satisfies ( the generalization to @xmath810 of ) the relations ( [ eq : cond(i ) ] ) and ( [ eq : cond(ii ) ] ) , _ i.e. _ , it is a _",
    "cyclic cocycle_.    given a complex algebra @xmath158 , an _",

    "one can introduce the structure of a graded differential algebra defining the differential as @xmath1056.\\ ] ] letting @xmath1057 be spanned by elements of the form @xmath1058 , and so on , we arrive at the formula @xmath1059_{\\pm}$ ] as a suitable definition for @xmath1060 , where the bracket denotes a supercommutator ( depending on the degree of @xmath211 ) .",
    "an important class of examples for cyclic - cocycles is afforded by the so - called schwinger terms ( as defined in the previous section ) in quantum field theory . in the context of charged fermionic fields ,",
    "we start with a real vector space @xmath789 ( given as a certain space of solutions to the classical field equation ) , a symmetric bilinear form @xmath508 on @xmath789 and a compatible ( orthogonal ) complex structure @xmath824 .",
    "physically , @xmath824 is determined by the spectrum of the hamiltonian . from the data @xmath1061",
    "one then defines a complex hilbert space which is the complexification of @xmath789 using @xmath824 as the complex structure .",
    "so we get a hilbert space @xmath1062 , where the inner product is given by @xmath1063 we also have a representation of the field algebra on fock space , @xmath1064 now , the point is that the schwinger term @xmath1065 -\\dot \\mu[a , b ] = \\frac{i}{8}\\tr \\left(j[j , a][j , b]\\right),\\ ] ] defines a cyclic 1-cocycle . a geometric interpretation of this cocycle is then made possible in the context of non - commutative geometry described above .",
    "when discussing the entanglement properties of spin chains , we found that the entanglement entropy of a sub - chain of length @xmath764 , at the critical point , scales logarithmically with @xmath764 .",
    "we mentioned that the constant in front of the logarithm was related to _",
    "central charge _ of the corresponding conformal field theory .",
    "these central charges can also be understood as anomalies appearing in the quantization process of the effective field theories describing the spin chains . as an example , let us consider the ising chain : @xmath1066 using the wigner - jordan transformation and then defining the ( majorana ) operators  @xcite @xmath1067 we obtain @xmath1068 we can go to the continuum limit by assuming the sites in the chain are separated by a unit length @xmath1069 and defining @xmath1070 .",
    "then , to first order in @xmath1069 , we have : @xmath1071 defining the `` chiral '' components @xmath1072 and the corresponding spinor @xmath1073 one obtains , using heisenberg s equations of motion , @xmath1074 where @xmath1075 is such that @xmath1076 .      in the massless case , ( [ eq : dirac ] ) can be obtained from the lagrangian @xmath1080 .",
    "considering the spatial coordinate @xmath1081 to be defined on @xmath1082 ( which amounts to imposing periodic boundary conditions on the spin chain ) , expand the chiral fields in fourier modes and then express the hamiltonian density @xmath1083 , and the energy function @xmath1084 in terms of the fourier modes .    as the previous calculations show , when @xmath1078 the two chiral fields are completely decoupled from each other .",
    "thus , we may study them separately .",
    "let us consider @xmath1085 , for which the mode expansion must be of the form @xmath1086 imposing canonical anticommutation relations to the field ( which is real ) , we obtain : @xmath1087 from the previous exercise , we see that the contribution of @xmath1085 to the ( second quantized ) hamiltonian will be @xmath1088 where normal ordering has been introduced .",
    "now , how do we define normal ordering depends on what we regard as the `` vacuum state '' .",
    "this has important consequences for the commutation relations of the ( fourier components of the ) stress - energy tensor .    decomposing the stress - energy tensor @xmath1089 in light - cone components @xmath1090 and @xmath1091 ,",
    "show that @xmath1092 , and that the fourier components ( @xmath1093 ) of @xmath1094 satisfy the following commutation relations ( virasoro algebra ) : @xmath1095 = ( m - n ) l_{m+n } + \\frac{c}{12 } ( m^3-m)\\delta_{m+n,0},\\ ] ] with @xmath743 .",
    "the correct solution of the previous exercise depends crucially in a careful handling of the normal ordering prescription .",
    "this in turn is related to the `` filling - up of the dirac sea '' which , in mathematical terms , can be reduced to the problem of quantizing a linear system with an appropriately chosen complex structure .",
    "in fact , writing the hamiltonian density in terms of the spinor @xmath719 , we obtain @xmath1096 this means that the 1-particle hamiltonian ( which is defined on the hilbert space @xmath1097 ) is given by @xmath1098 .",
    "as we have seen , the splitting of the 1-particle hilbert space into positive and negative energy states gives rise to a complex structure , which is the one that should be used for quantization .",
    "when this is done , one obtains the anomalous term of the virasoro algebra as an anomaly ( schwinger term ) given precisely as a cyclic 1-cocyle of the form ( [ eq : schwinger - term ] ) .",
    "now , the relevance of this fact in the context of quantum phase transitions is that there are already some geometric characterizations of the critical point in terms of , _",
    "e.g. _ , berry phases  @xcite .",
    "this has also been related to the behavior of certain chern numbers associated to the parameter space of the spin chain  @xcite .",
    "now , using araki s self - dual formalism , it should also be possible to compute the cocycle outside the critical point .",
