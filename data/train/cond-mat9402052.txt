    "langevin equations in spatially - extended systems have been extensively used in the studies of equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena where fluctuations are important .",
    "these equations are stochastic partial differential equations in which the fluctuations are introduced through a noise term , whose stochastic properties are chosen according to the physical situation .",
    "fluctuations of internal ( thermal ) origin represent microscopic degrees of freedom , and since they evolve in spatial and temporal scales much shorter than those of the gross variables of the system , they are assumed to be uncorrelated ( delta correlated ) in space and time . in this case",
    "they are modelled by a gaussian - and - white noise process in space and time . on the other hand , if the origin of the fluctuations is external to the system , the possibility of a noise with some spatial or temporal structure has to be considered .",
    "langevin equations have been used in many different scenarios , one of which has been for many years the study of dynamical critical phenomena @xcite . the methodology used there is a suitable extension of the renormalization group techniques developed for the study of static critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the technique has also been generalized to study nonequilibrium systems presenting some kind of scale invariance or criticality @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will follow this methodology as it was implemented in refs .",
    "@xcite to study the nonequilibrium critical properties of a langevin - equation model with a non - white ( colored ) noise .    among the different models that can be considered we have chosen the simplest one , in which the order parameter is not conserved .",
    "this model is useful for describing order - disorder transitions . in this non - conserved case",
    "the equation of motion of the field variable is @xmath2 } { \\delta \\psi({\\bf x},t ) } + \\xi({\\bf x},t ) , \\label{eq : tdglm}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the position in a d - dimensional space , @xmath4 $ ] is the ginzburg - landau free - energy functional @xmath5=\\int d^dx \\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}r\\psi^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\mid\\nabla \\psi\\mid^2 + \\frac{1}{4}u\\psi^4\\right\\}.\\ ] ] and the correlation of the noise is @xmath6 where @xmath7 to ensure the correct equilibrium steady state .",
    "this is known as _ model a _ in the notation of ref .",
    "this model comes from a coarse - graining procedure applied to a spin model @xcite .",
    "its behavior can be easily understood by means of a mean - field analysis of the potential given by the ginzburg - landau free energy .",
    "when @xmath8 is positive this potential has a minimum at zero field , which corresponds to a coarse - grained field equal to 0 ( i.e. the spins are randomly up or down ) .",
    "a negative value of @xmath8 leads to a potential with two nonzero symmetrical minima ( the spins have a preferred direction , either up or down ) .",
    "the role of noise in this scheme is a disordering one : when @xmath8 is negative and the intensity of the noise increases , the potential barrier between the two minima is more easily surpassed by the spins .",
    "thus , although the potential shape does not change , the coarse - grained field will eventually become zero ( for a high enough value of the intensity of the noise ) : the spins will be disordered because their thermal energy ( i.e. the noise intensity ) is so high that they do not see the potential barrier .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the model ( [ eq : tdglm]-[eq : glf ] ) in the special situation characterized by the fact that the noise term @xmath9 is non - delta correlated . in this case",
    "there is no fluctuation - dissipation relation and the steady state is not the equilibrium one .",
    "hence we are facing with a pure non - equilibrium problem . in a first approach to this problem",
    "we will assume that the correlation is of the ornstein - uhlenbeck type : @xmath10 this is a suitable way of modelling the noise in the case when it is external .",
    "@xmath11 is its _",
    "correlation time_. it can be seen that in the limit @xmath12 the noise becomes white and the equilibrium situation is recovered provided @xmath7 .",
    "navely , one might say that an increasing value of @xmath11 makes the noise `` softer '' , taking it farther from the white character ( given by @xmath12 ) and reducing its effective intensity .",
    "this effect has indeed been found numerically @xcite and approximate techniques borrowed from stochastic theory have been developed in order to understand this phenomenon @xcite . in this paper",
    "we perform dynamic renormalization - group ( drg ) calculations on this model in order to study the effects of the correlation time of the noise in the non - equilibrium critical behavior of the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in next section we present a preliminary scaling analysis to obtain some of the critical characteristics of our model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : drg - an ] the dynamic renormalization group results are presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec : space ] we summarize the results corresponding to a noise colored in both space and time .",
    "the comparison between our theoretical results and those obtained from simulations is given in sect .",
    "[ sec : comp ] .",
    "technical details of the drg calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "a glimpse of the relevance of the different terms in ( [ eq : glf ] ) at the critical point can be obtained by studying the effect of a scale transformation on the dynamical equation ( [ eq : tdglm ] ) .",
    "let this scale transformation be defined by @xmath13 with @xmath14 , which means that one is focusing on long distances ( characteristic of the critical point ) .",
    "@xmath15 is related to the equilibrium exponent @xmath16 via @xmath17 @xcite . introducing these changes into eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdglm ] ) and making use of the expression of the ginzburg - landau functional ( [ eq : glf ] ) one can see that the dynamical equation becomes @xmath18 now we define a rescaled noise @xmath19 , which has a new intensity @xmath20 and a correlation time @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , in order to keep the shape of the dynamical equation after the scale transformation , we also define the following rescaled parameters : @xmath22 now we place ourselves in the critical region of the system ( which in a first approximation is supposed to be located near @xmath23 ) where , in the absence of the nonlinear term ( @xmath24 ) , the equation remains invariant under the scale transformation if the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath25 are chosen to be @xmath26 these are the _ trivial exponents _ of model ( [ eq : tdglm]-[eq : glf ] ) with colored noise , which coincide with the ones corresponding to the white - noise case @xcite .",
    "they are valid when the nonlinearity of the model does not play a role in the critical behavior of the system , and this occurs beyond a critical dimension which we can now determine . as we have seen in ( [ eq : rescpar ] ) , the nonlinear coefficient @xmath27 transforms upon rescaling with an exponent @xmath28 . by making use of the trivial values of @xmath25 and @xmath15",
    ", one finds that this exponent happens to be @xmath29 .",
    "thus when @xmath30 , the nonlinearity decreases under rescaling ( @xmath14 ) , so that @xmath27 is _",
    "irrelevant_. on the other hand , for @xmath31 , @xmath27 grows under rescaling , and hence it is now _",
    "relevant_. this analysis is independent of the character of the noise , i.e. it does not depend on whether the noise is white or colored .",
    "in fact , since @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the correlation time @xmath11 is always an irrelevant parameter , so that one should not expect any effect of it in the universal properties of the model .",
    "however it has , as we will see , influence on the system .",
    "the drg is going to be implemented in fourier space , so the first thing we must do is to transform our langevin equation ( [ eq : tdglm ] ) conveniently .",
    "let us define the fourier transform of a field variable @xmath34 as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a vector in a d - dimensional ( fourier ) space . according to these definitions ,",

    "( [ eq : tdglm ] ) can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 stands for @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the zeroth - order aproximation ( in @xmath27 ) to the field in momentum space : @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the propagator : @xmath43 on the other hand , by using definition ( [ eq : ftdef ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : oun ] ) we can calculate the correlation of the noise in fourier space : @xmath44    _ diagrammatic version of eq .",

    "the propagator is represented by a thin line with an arrow . as can be seen in this figure , momentum through a vertex",
    "must be conserved .    in this work",
    "we have decided to carry out a drg analysis using the standard momentum shell integration scheme . while details of this method are well documented in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we briefly review the procedure , which consists of the two following steps :    [ [ momentum - shell - integration . ] ] momentum shell integration .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the first step of the drg is to eliminate the short wavelength modes ( i.e. integrate out modes in the momentum shell @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the momemtum upper cutoff ) , since we are interested in the long wavelength behavior of the system .    [ [ space - rescaling . ] ] space rescaling .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    after the momentum shell intergration step , we rescale space in such a way that the full momentum space is recovered .",
    "this leads to the differential equations satisfied by the running coupling constants . a fixed point analysis of these equations",
    "will then reveal the scaling properties of the long wavelength correlations which we are seeking .",
    "explicit details of the drg calculations for our model are summarised in the appendix .",
    "the drg results are obtained from the analysis of the _ differential flow equations _",
    "@xcite , defined as the infinitesimal variation of the parameters when the renormalization step @xmath50 is very small . from ( [ eq : rec ] ) , they are simply :    [ eq : dfe ] @xmath51    where the following parameters have been defined : @xmath52    the _ fixed point _ of this transformation is the one at which these derivatives are zero .",
    "physically it represents the critical point of the system .",
    "therefore , by studying its position as a function of @xmath11 we will be able to study the influence of the time correlation of the noise in the disordering transition induced by the noise intensity . by imposing this invariance on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dfe - mu ] ) and ( [ eq : dfe - d ] ) one finds that the values of the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath25 up to @xmath53 are the trivial ones already obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : trivial - exp ] .",
    "invariance of the static parameters ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dfe - r ] ) and ( [ eq : dfe - u ] ) ) shows that the fixed point is given by : @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( white noise ) the critical value of @xmath8 is negative , which is reasonable : in the presence of an additive ( disordering ) noise , the system will be disordered even for a small negative value of @xmath8 . when @xmath56 the critical value of @xmath8 is nearer 0 , which means that the disordering effect of the noise will somehow become diminished because of its correlation in time .",
    "thus the effect of the time correlation of the noise is a `` softening '' one , as expected and explained above .",
    "it is worth noting that in the white - noise limit our results coincide with the known values appearing in the literature @xcite .    concerning the evaluation of the critical exponents of the system ,",
    "this can be done in a simple way once the recursion relations are known . by making use of standard techniques @xcite involving the evaluation of the eigenvalues of the recursion - relation matrix",
    "it is easily seen that there is _",
    "no _ contribution of @xmath11 ( up to first order ) to any of the exponents .",
    "hence one can conclude from this analysis that a correlation in time of the fluctuations affecting a @xmath0 non - conserved model influences the position of the critical point of the system ( as observed numerically @xcite ) , but _ not _ its universal properties ( through its critical exponents ) .",
    "a more realistic assumption in relation to external noise is the existence of a non - delta correlation also in space .",
    "intuition tells us that the influence of a non - zero correlation length of the noise will be qualitatively the same as the effect of the correlation time , i.e. an ordering one .",
    "this was checked numerically and also explained theoretically in ref .",
    "a drg argument concerning this behavior can be made in a straightforward way following the procedure previously described .",
    "the noise is chosen to be a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : oun ] ) with no delta correlation in space .",
    "this can be done in a simple way by assuming that it obeys the langevin equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a gaussian white noise with correlation ( [ eq : white ] ) .",
    "this is an extension of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , where the laplacian term takes into account the coupling of the field at different points @xcite , so that @xmath59 is the correlation length .",
    "the correlation of this noise in fourier space can be seen to be @xmath60 which can be compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourcor ] ) .",
    "the scaling analysis of sec . [ sec : trivial - exp ] applied to this new situation shows that @xmath59 changes as @xmath61 , so that it is an irrelevant parameter ( as @xmath11 ) .",
    "nevertheless we aim to analyze , as in the case of the correlation time , its nonuniversal effects on the system .",
    "the contribution of @xmath59 to the diagrams which renormalize @xmath8 and @xmath27 can be easily obtained .",
    "the new results for the corresponding differential flow equations are    [ eq : dfe - lbd ] @xmath62    which should be compared to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dfe - r]-[eq : dfe - u ] ) .",
    "these new contributions of @xmath59 modify the value of the fixed point in such a way that @xmath63 and @xmath64 become : @xmath65 this modification does not lead to variations of the eigenvalues of the matrix associated to the transformation , so that critical exponents are not changed from the white - noise case , as expected .    hence we can conclude that the noises used here , either ( [ eq : fourcor ] ) or ( [ eq : lbdcorr ] ) , with a finite correlation time and length , change the position of the critical point but not the critical exponents , when compared to the white - noise case ( [ eq : white ] ) .",
    "this is due to the way this kind of noises behave ( see ( [ eq : rescint ] ) , for instance ) .",
    "should the correlation of the noise decay as a power law , then , according to the scaling analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , critical exponents would be changed .",
    "in refs . @xcite model a ( [ eq : tdglm ] ) with noises ( [ eq : oun ] ) and ( [ eq : lbdcorr ] ) was studied by means of a numerical simulation in 2-d .",
    "two main results were obtained there .",
    "firstly , it was established that either @xmath11 or @xmath59 stabilize the system , in the sense that the critical value of the noise intensity is enlarged .",
    "secondly , critical exponents were also evaluated by means of a finite - size scaling analysis , and their values were found to be similar ( within error bars ) to the accepted values for the white - noise case . since the numerical evidence of the critical - noise - intensity shift as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath59 is much clearer , that is what we want to explain in the light of the above drg results .",
    "the simulation model , defined by fixed values of @xmath8 , @xmath66 and @xmath27 , was @xmath67 where the only independent parameters were the noise parameters @xmath68 , @xmath11 and @xmath59 .",

    "certainly one can not expect a good agreement between a calculation in 4-d extended to 2-d and a numerical simulation of a 2-d model in a finite discrete lattice . in this sense ,",
    "the predicted value for @xmath75 is very different from the numerical result ( 0.38 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio @xmath76 gives better results , as one can see in fig .",
    "2 . one can thus conclude that rg calculations have given a reasonable explanation of the critical results for model a when a colored noise is considered .",

    "in order to eliminate the outer ( high - momentum ) modes from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft2 ] ) we break the integral term ( the third diagram in fig .",
    "1 ) into modes located in the inner hypersphere ( i.e. those with @xmath77 ) , which will be called _ external modes _ ; and modes located in the outer shell ( i.e. those with @xmath78 ) , which will be referred to as _ internal modes_. this leads to a rewriting of eq .",

    "3b ) can be solved iteratively up to @xmath79 , and the result can be introduced in the internal contributions to the integral term of the corresponding dynamical equation for the external field ( fig .",
    "this leads to a renormalized equation where internal modes appear only in the noise term . after averaging out this internal noise",
    ", the remaining renormalized equation is the one represented in fig .",
    "4 .        in order to understand the meaning of the new notation introduced in fig .",
    "4 , let us make explicit the first diagram .",
    "it comes from an average over the internal noise term , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . explicitly ,",
    "@xmath80 where definition of @xmath40 ( [ eq : psizero ] ) and correlation of the noise in fourier space ( [ eq : fourcor ] ) have been used .",
    "we will denote this result as shown in the second member of fig .",
    "the superindex @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) on @xmath42 and @xmath34 denotes an external ( internal ) mode .",
    "now we will be able to write down the transformation ( recursion ) relations for the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath66 and @xmath27 .",
    "we are in the zone where @xmath27 is relevant ( @xmath83 ) but are also supposing it to be small ( which will presumably occur for @xmath84 ) . therefore if these recursion relations are to be an expansion around @xmath24 they should also be an expansion in @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 will also be supposed to be small in the following calculations ( we are interested in the critical point ) .",
    "it should be noted that the diagram in fig .",
    "5 contains only one thick line , and will therefore renormalize the diagram at the left member of the figure , whereas the second bubble contains three thick lines , so that it will add to the one - vertex diagram at the right member of the figure .",
    "that means , as we will see , that the first bubble renormalizes @xmath8 and the second one @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath66 is not renormalized at @xmath86 , since the one - thick - line bubble does not contain any term proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "concerning the computation of the diagrams , it should be said that the frequency integrals can be evaluated by means of contour integrations in the complex plane , and the integrals in momentum space can also be calculated by assuming @xmath88 @xcite and a very small @xmath11 .",
    "these integrals should be expanded in @xmath85 , but since they are all multiplied by @xmath27 , which is also small , we only need their zero order in @xmath89 .",
    "thus we evaluate them in @xmath90 .",
    "we also let @xmath91 . moreover , since the parameter @xmath50 is the step of the renormalization procedure , and we want this procedure to be continuous , we will assume @xmath92 .",
    "after all these considerations , the final result can be shown to be        we also want to know how the noise intensity d changes under the effects of the drg .",
    "this is not given by the analysis explained above , because the parameter d does not appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft2 ] ) . to make it come out explicitly",
    "one can `` autocorrelate '' this equation , i.e. multiply the equation for @xmath97 by the same equation for @xmath98 .",
    "this can be done diagrammatically in a simple way .",
    "it can be seen that the first diagram renormalizing @xmath68 is a two - vertex diagram , which means that it is of @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the recursion relation for @xmath68 up to the order we are considering is simply @xmath100 it is worth noting that there is no first - order correction in @xmath11 neither for @xmath66 , @xmath27 nor @xmath68 .",
    "finally , we want the drg procedure to lead to a renormalized equation as similar as possible to the original one . at this moment",
    "both equations are identical in form , the only difference being the range of the variable in momentum space to which they are applied .",
    "indeed , the renormalized equation only governs the evolution of the external modes . in order to eliminate this difference",
