    "magnetoelectric multiferroics , insulating magnets exhibiting simultaneous magnetic and ferroelectric order , are widely investigated in large part due to their potential applications for developing novel devices , including magnetic sensors and multistate memory , among others [ ] . the cross - control of these distinct order parameters , such as adjusting the magnetization using an applied electric field or vice - versa , is expected to provide an extra degree of freedom in developing new types of spin - charge coupled devices , such as voltage switchable magnetic memories [ ] . additionally , there are a number of fundamental materials questions surrounding the development of multiferroic order .",
    "magnetic and ferroelectric order are generally contraindicated in the same phase , as ferromagnetism in transition metal systems typically requires partially filled d - orbitals while ferroelectric distortions are promoted in a d@xmath2 electronic configuration [ ] . despite this apparent restriction , a rather large number of single phase systems have been identified as magnetoelectric multiferroics [ ] . a number of microscopic mechanisms have been proposed for the development of multiferroic order , including , a magnetic jahn - teller distortion [ ] for tbmn@xmath3o@xmath4 , [ ] bond and site ordering having distinct centers of inversion symmetry , [ ] a microscopic mechanism leading to a spin - current interaction [ ] , the dzyloshinskii - moriya interaction , [ ] a general anisotropic exchange striction , [ ] a spin - phonon interaction , [ ] and a strain induced ferroelectricity . [ ]    phenomenologically , magnetically - induced ferroelectric order developing in systems having multiple magnetic phases can be understood by considering a trilinear term in the magnetoelectric free energy , f@xmath5 , coupling the electric polarization with two distinct order parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 which together break inversion symmetry so that f@xmath8p@xmath9 [ ] . since the free energy must transform as a scalar , there are strong symmetry restrictions on the allowed representations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; in particular , the product @xmath10 must be antisymmetric under spatial inversion .",
    "this trilinear coupling also predicts electric field control of a magnetic order parameter [ ] .",
    "a general discussion of the symmetry of the magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics is considered for the specific case of in the following section .",
    "investigations on multiferroic thin films , in which such a trilinear coupling is believed to be responsible for the multiferroic order [ ] , have established that the multiferroic transition temperature can be varied through the application of either ( or both ) magnetic and electric fields [ ] , confirming the strong coupling between magnetic and dielectric degrees of freedom .",
    "higher order magnetoelectric coupling terms quadratic in both magnetic and ferroelectric terms will give rise to magnetization induced shift in the dielectric response [ ] . such coupling has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in a range of materials including mn@xmath11o@xmath12 [ ] , cocr@xmath3o@xmath12 [ ] , bamnf@xmath12 [ ] , and secuo@xmath11 and tecuo@xmath11 [ ] . because this magnetodielectric coupling is also expected to depend strongly on the symmetry of the magnetic phase , it has been suggested that changes in this coupling may be used to probe changes in the ordered spin structure [ ] .",
    "triclinic iron vanadate , , has recently been identified as a multiferroic system having the p@xmath13 space group [ ] .",
    "magnetic , thermodynamic , and neutron diffraction studies on single crystal and ceramic samples have shown that transitions from a paramagnetic phase into a collinear incommensurate ( ci ) phase at @xmath14=22 k and then into non - collinear incommensurate ( nci ) phase at @xmath0=15 k. [ ] ferroelectric order in develops in this non - collinear spiral magnetic phase .",
    "the onset of ferroelectric order with the development of a second magnetic phase suggests that a symmetry - based approach may be useful in exploring the multiferroic properties in this system .",
    "we present a full landau theory for this system , specifically considering the allowed magnetoelectric coupling terms .",
    "our result is that a nonzero induced spontaneous polarization @xmath15 requires having a magnetic spiral [ ] described by two order parameters which are out of phase with respect to one another .",

    "the fourth order magnetoelectric coupling contains terms quadratic in @xmath46 and @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath35 is the order parameter that develops at @xmath14 , then this coupling is probably dominated by @xmath64 at high temperatures .",
    "the finite spin correlations developing above @xmath14 cause @xmath65 to be nonzero so that the coupling term is in effect @xmath66 , where @xmath67 . this term produces a shift in the dielectric constant in the paramagnetic phase , as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) below approximately 30 k. below @xmath14 , approximately 22 k , when @xmath35 acquires a finite expectation value , a trilinear coupling term @xmath68 is allowed .",
    "this term will lead to mode mixing so that the critical mode approaching @xmath0 is not @xmath36 but @xmath69 where @xmath70 is of order @xmath71 [ ]",
    ". then the divergence in this variable as @xmath0 is approached will lead to a simultaneous divergence ( with a very much reduced amplitude ) in the observed dielectric constant .",
    "this mode mixing is therefore expected to lead to a slight increase in the magnetodielectric shift below @xmath14 [ ] . this is seen clearly in fig .",
    "2b , where the dashed line shows the extrapolation of the magnetodielectric shift from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , an extrapolation that does not include any corrections arising from the trilinear magnetoelectric term .      to further investigate spin - charge coupling in , we plot the temperature dependent dielectric constant measured at different magnetic fields in fig 2(c ) .",
    "we find that the dielectric anomaly signaling the onset of ferroelectric order shifts to lower temperatures with increasing magnetic field , with the reduction in transition temperature reaching 0.7 k in a magnetic field of @xmath74=80 koe .",
    "this result is expected , as the ferroelectric order producing the dielectric anomaly is associated with the incommensurate spiral transition , which typically show a reduction in transition temperature in applied magnetic fields .",
    "we conducted additional measurements of the dielectric response of the bulk sample while sweeping the magnetic field at fixed temperature .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "3 , plotted as @xmath75 versus @xmath74 with data measured at different temperatures offset vertically for clarity . at @xmath76=17 k , which is intermediate between @xmath14 and @xmath0 , there is a small negative magnetocapacitance , with the dielectric constant being reduced by approximately 0.03% in a field of @xmath74=80 koe .",
    "as the temperature approaches the multiferroic transition at @xmath0 , the magnetodielectric coupling shows qualitative changes . by @xmath76=15",
    "k the magnetocapacitive shift is positive for small fields , with a shift in dielectric constant on the order of 0.02% at high magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetocapacitive response is maximal near @xmath76=14.5 k , with the dielectric constant being reduced by approximately 0.1% in a field of @xmath74=80 koe . at still lower temperatures the magnitude of the magnetocapacitive shift becomes smaller .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic feature in the isothermal magnetocapacitance curves presented in fig .",
    "3 is the presence of clear maxima , which vary as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "these maxima appear first at small fields at @xmath76=14.5 k , then shift to larger fields as the temperature is reduced .",
    "we believe that these anomalies do not reflect the suppression of the multiferroic transition temperature in a magnetic field , as discussed in the context of fig 2(b ) .",
    "these isothermal dielectric anomalies persist to temperatures 2 k or 3 k below @xmath0 , while the maximum suppression of @xmath0 was only 0.7 k over the field range studied , as determined from the measurements in fig .",
    "3 . we propose that this dielectric anomaly may indicate a spin - reorientation transition in .",
    "the magnetodielectric coupling is expected to depend on the symmetry of the magnetically ordered state [ ] , so a field induced spin reorientation crossover could potentially produce the low temperature dielectric anomalies observed in fig .",
    "similar magnetic field - induced dielectric anomalies have been observed in other materials including mn@xmath11o@xmath12 [ ] , although the specific mechanisms responsible remain unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the external magnetic field serves to reduce the slight geometrical frustration present in [ ] , allowing a different spin structure to emerge .",
    "alternatively , the spin orientation could be a spin - flop transition as seen in tbmno@xmath11 .",
    "[ ] we note , however , that remains ferroelectric at high magnetic fields [ ] , so the modified spin structures would still need to transform as defined by eq .",
    "3 .        the trilinear magnetoelectric coupling that produces multiferroic order , given in eq . 6 , also results in an electric field ( @xmath79 ) dependence of the magnetic structure through the coupling term in the free energy @xmath80 .",
    "we first confirmed that these thin film samples were also multiferroic , through measurements of the dielectric constant and pyrocurrent , illustrated in fig .",
    "the dielectric constant for the thin film is slightly higher than that found for the ceramic sample .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy mainly to the uncertainty in accurately determining the geometrical factor for these thin films .",
    "the dielectric response for these thin film samples is approximately independent of measuring frequency and the loss for these films is tan @xmath81 0.01 , which may be due to the presence of pinhole defects in the thin film sample as seen in the sem micrograph in fig .",
    "the zero - field temperature dependent dielectric constant , measured at @xmath82=30 khz , is plotted in fig .",
    "there is a sharp peak near @xmath0=15 k , associated with the development of ferroelectric order in these thin film samples .",
    "we note that , unlike the measurements on bulk shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the background dielectric constant for decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature .",
    "this behaviour can be associated with the much larger conductivity of the thin film sample , arising from the presence of the pinhole defects , which obscures the low temperature increase in dielectric constant observed in bulk ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) .",
    "we confirmed that the low temperature phase of the thin film is ferroelectric by integrating the pyrocurrent after poling at positive and negative fields to yield the spontaneous polarization .",
    "these results are shown in the inset to fig .",
    "4(a ) and indicate a spontaneous polarization of 6 @xmath83c / m@xmath84 , consistent with previous measurements on polycrystalline bulk [ ] measurements of the dielectric response for thin films under applied magnetic fields ( not shown ) yield a suppression of the multiferroic transition temperature very similar to that observed in bulk ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    to probe the electric field control of the multiferroic phase transition temperature , expected from the nature of the magnetoelectric coupling , we measured the temperature dependent dielectric response in the thin film sample as a function of bias voltage .",
    "focusing on thin film samples allows the application of relatively large electric fields ( on the order of mv / m ) with small applied bias voltages .",
    "we chose to probe the transition through dielectric measurements as the magnetic anomaly at @xmath0 can not be clearly discerned in these thin film samples .",
    "we plot the temperature dependent dielectric constant measured at e=0 and e=3.75 mv / m in fig .",
    "with the application of an electric field , the dielectric peak shifts upwards in temperature , by approximately 0.25 k in a field of e=3.75 mv / m .",
    "we note that any sample heating , which is expected to be negligible in any case because of the low dissipation , would raise the sample temperature relative to the thermometer temperature , leading to an apparent decrease in transition temperature , rather than the increase seen in fig .",
    "this increase in transition temperature is consistent with an external electric field promoting the development of ferroelectric order , and is similar to what has been observed previously in multiferroic films [ ] .",
    "the relatively small increase of the ferroelectric transition under such large applied electric fields can be directly attributed to the very small polarization in .",
    "we confirmed that the dielectric anomaly in fig .",
    "4(b ) can still be associated with the multiferroic transition , even in the presence of an electric field , by measuring the response under the simultaneous application of magnetic and electric fields ( not shown ) .",
    "although the dielectric peak broadens considerably , the continuing presence of a single peak under such crossed fields is strong evidence that this anomaly reflects the multiferroic transition in .       and",

    "we plot the e - field and h - field dependence of the multiferroic transition temperature in ( @xmath0 ) in fig .",
    "5(a ) , where ci and nci represent the incommensurate magnetic structures below @xmath14 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "this transition temperature is monotonically suppressed in an applied magnetic field , decreasing by approximately 0.7 k in an applied field of @xmath74=80 koe .",
    "the transition temperature , however , increases systematically with increasing bias voltage , shifting upwards by 0.25 k in an electric field of roughly 4 mv / m . as discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] , the magnetic field dependence of the ci - nci phase boundary is expected to follow @xmath86 , while the electric field dependence should be @xmath87 .",
    "this ability to control the transition temperature using either magnetic or electric fields is a key feature for a number of proposed applications for multiferroic materials .",
    "although the size of the transition temperature shifts in are likely too small to be of any practical use , these results , taken in conjunction with previous studies on thin films , provide important evidence that this behaviour is generic among multiferroic materials .",
    "the magnetodielectric coupling in allows us to tentatively identify the onset of short - range magnetic correlations , as indicated by the increase in dielectric constant below @xmath76=30 k in fig .",

    "the high - field putative spin - reorientation structure is labeled as nci@xmath85 . as the two boundaries do not coincide , the dielectric anomalies in fig .",
    "3 are not likely to be associated with the @xmath14 to @xmath0 magnetic transition , but may potentially be attributed to a change in magnetic structure . magnetic field dependent specific heat measurements ( not shown ) do not show any additional anomalies at this proposed cross - over , suggesting there is a negligible change in entropy between the two spin structures .",
    "we have presented a model for the development of multiferroic order in in the context of landau theory , which we have used to develop constraints on the possible magnetic structures based on symmetry considerations alone .",
    "one of the noteworthy predictions of this model is that the electric polarization in the multiferroic phase is able to develop along any direction . to further investigate the higher order magnetoelectric coupling in this system ,",
    "we have investigated the ferroelectric and dielectric response in to applied magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the multiferroic phase transition temperature can be tuned by applying electric or magnetic fields , in line with the predicted trilinear magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "we find evidence for a shift in dielectric constant well above the magnetic transition temperature @xmath14 , which is expected to develop from a fourth order magnetoelectric coupling term when short range spin correlations develop in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the dielectric constant shows a small , but distinct , increase below the first magnetic order transition , which is consistent with the contribution from a trilinear magnetoelectric coupling term .",
