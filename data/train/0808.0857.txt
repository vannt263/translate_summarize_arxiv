    "double - peaked emitters are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) whose broad balmer - line profiles have a characteristic `` double - humped '' shape , with one peak blueward of the rest - frame wavelength of the line and another one redward of it . the best explanation for the origin of the double - peaked shape involves emission from a region in the agn accretion disk . since the first examples of double - peaked emission lines in agns were published in the 1980s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more than 100 double - peaked emitters have been found .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and replaces the standard thin disk .",
    "the illumination provided by the central elevated structure in agns with riafs is necessary , but not sufficient , for the production of double - peaked lines of the observed strength : all blrgs with double - peaked lines require external illumination ( since the viscous power available locally in the disk is insufficient to explain the line strength ) , but not all blrgs or other riaf agns have double - peaked lines .",
    "the association of rl agns with riafs could explain the higher frequency of double - peaked emitters observed among blrgs ( 20% ; e03 ) , compared to 3% of low - redshift sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) agns .",
    "recent work by @xcite , however , has shown that not all blrg double - peaked emitters with low optical luminosities are inefficient emitters : pictor  a , for example , emits a bolometric luminosity of more than 8% of the eddington luminosity , which is too high to support a riaf ( riaf solutions exist for @xmath35 , for a viscosity parameter @xmath36 , and the radiated energy is further reduced by the accretion efficiency ; * ? ? ?",
    "the systematic search for agns with double - peaked balmer lines in the sdss revealed that as many as 3% of @xmath37 objects are double - peaked emitters , regardless of their radio loudness ( strateva et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter , s03 ) . moreover , a handful of luminous higher - redshift double - peaked emitters were discovered serendipitously based on their h@xmath38 and line profiles .",
    "the expansion of the parameter space of the double - peaked emission - line agns to include radio - quiet ( rq , @xmath39 ) and higher luminosity objects , as well as the discovery of low optical luminosity objects like pictor  a that are efficient accretors , require a critical evaluation of the existing models of illumination and the conditions necessary for the existence of double - peaked emission lines .",
    "x - ray observations of the new extended sample are particularly important , since they allow us to obtain more accurate estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the sources and to gauge the need for extra illumination of the accretion disk .",
    "double - peaked emitters which are efficient accretors likely require an alternative mode of illumination .",
    "the development of new scenarios can be guided by observations in the x - ray band .",
    "basic x - ray absorption constraints , for example , provide sensitive probes of the nuclear conditions : ( 1 ) they allow us to see any intervening material right up to the agn core , and ( 2 ) they are sensitive to molecular , atomic , or ionized gas and dust .",
    "the absorption constraints could provide sensitive tests of specific models proposed to explain the expanded population of double - peaked emitters .",
    "a recent model by @xcite , for example , aims to explain the disk illumination necessary for the existence of the double - peaked lines with the presence of jets in rl , and slower , less - collimated outflows in rq double - peaked emitters .",
    "the predictions of this model can be tested directly by obtaining x - ray spectroscopy of double - peaked emitters and looking for signs of these outflows in absorption .",
    "in addition to testing specific models of illumination , comparison of the x - ray emission of double - peaked emitters to that of typical agns is essential for uncovering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the dominance of accretion - disk balmer - line emission in this type of agn . such findings , which will also elucidate the physical conditions in agns with the broadest observed balmer lines , will have implications for the ( still uncertain ) structure of the broad line region ( blr ) in agns in general .",

    "the @xcite sample was biased toward agns with good s / n _ einstein _ data ( hence x - ray brighter than the typical agn ) and bright in the extreme uv , and @xcite argue that typical agns are redder and have lower x - ray - to - optical ratios .",
    "the @xcite rq sed has an @xmath230 and the @xcite rq sed an @xmath231 , compared to @xmath232 and @xmath233 for their respective @xmath217 from the @xcite relation ; both seds have total ( including the ir bump ) bolometric luminosities of @xmath234ergs@xmath63 .",
    "note that the galex observations agree well with the optically - scaled @xcite template seds for the four rq _ chandra _ agn ( within 0.11dex , or @xmath235% ) .",
    "the _ nuv _ band and the optical bracket rest - frame 2500  in all four cases , suggesting that the @xmath217 estimates based on the optically - scaled teplate seds and the uv - to - x - ray indices are fairly robust ( changes in @xmath208 of less than 0.05 ) .",
    "the rl agn , sdssj1238@xmath55325 , is 0.4dex more luminous in the _ nuv _ band during the galex epoch relative to the het - epoch optically - scaled rl template sed ; a similar variation at 2500  in the 17 days ( 13 in the agn rest frame ) between the _ chandra _ and het observations would result in a change in @xmath208 of 0.16 , and can not fully account for the observed flatter @xmath208 .",
    "the arp102b sed , discussed in more detail by @xcite , is shown in the last panel of figure  [ sed ] for comparison .",
    "we use the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ) x - ray spectrum presented by eracleous et al .",
    "( 2003a ; see also lewis & eracleous 2006 ) , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) uv spectrum given in @xcite , and the nir and mid - infrared ( mir ) spectra published by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite note strong stellar features in the nir spectrum of arp102b , which was integrated over a 700pc region centered on the active nucleus .",
    "the mir source extent , studied by @xcite , was around 250pc ; for comparison , the _ hst _ aperture diameter is @xmath70400pc .",
    "in the same panel of figure  [ sed ] , we show the average quasar sed from @xcite in the infrared - to - uv region ( scaled to the reddest uv wavelength of the arp102b _ hst _ spectrum , @xmath703200 ) together with the _ asca _ power law in the x - ray region .",
    "in addition , the nir emission of arp102b includes a strong galaxy contribution , while in the mir variability by a factor of 2.5 over a five year period was noted ; both variability and varying host - galaxy contributions are likely responsible for part of the discrepancy between the quasar sed and the arp102b ir data .",
    "the arp102b sed is characterized by a lack of a ` big blue bump ' ( bbb ) , the excess emission between the x - ray and uv bands ( @xmath236hz ) normally associated with the innermost parts of the accretion disk ( which is likely replaced by a hot radiatively inefficient central structure in the case of arp102b and other agns with riafs ) .",
    "in contrast to the arp102b sed , the galex observations of the five double - peaked emitters presented here show that the bbb is present in all five seds , with the possible exception of sdssj1004@xmath54801 .",
    "the presence of bbbs is further confirmation for the relatively high efficiency of the accretion flows in these agns , excluding riaf models for them .    using the template seds from figure  [ sed ]",
    ", we can estimate the bolometric luminosities of the double - peaked emitters which we list in the last column of table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the @xcite sed does not extend to the radio domain ( @xmath237 ) , but the @xmath238hz region is energetically unimportant and does not affect the bolometric luminosity estimates .",
    "the template sed bolometric luminosities will overestimate the true luminosities if the ir bump consists of fully reprocessed nuclear continuum emission and should be excluded when computing the total luminosity .",
    "such ` double - counting ' of the ir emission can result in overestimates of the bolometric luminosity of up to 2030% .",
    "we can obtain upper limits to the bolometric luminosities and an estimate of possible uncertainties by normalizing the ir - to - extreme - uv part of the sed template to the nir ( in all cases but sdssj1004@xmath54801 ) , the extreme uv ( in the case of sdssj1238@xmath55325 ) , and/or the sdss - epoch spectra ( in the case of sdssj2125@xmath10813 , for example , where the sdss - epoch flux was higher ) . in all cases , we find that the bolometric luminosities can be at most a factor of 23 higher than those reported in table  [ tab3 ] .    on average about 30% of the bolometric luminosity is emitted between kev in our sample ( with a range of 1636% ; or between 2% and 12% in the 0.52kev x - ray band ) , compared to @xmath239% emitted between kev for the agn composites of @xcite and @xmath240% for the median rq agn composite of @xcite .",
    "this comparison is not entirely fair , since the @xcite and @xcite seds are constructed using more luminous agns ( @xmath241 and @xmath242 , respectively ) and @xmath208 is luminosity dependent .",
    "if we renormalize the @xcite sed to the average value of @xmath217 in our sample , @xmath243 , and scale the x - ray part of the seds to the level inferred from the @xcite @xmath210 relation for typical rq agns , we find that even in this case only 78% of the bolometric luminosity is emitted between kev by typical rq agns .",
    "this restates the conclusion from   [ saox ] : the average rq double - peaked emitter from our _ chandra _ sample has an @xmath208 value flatter by 0.25dex relative to that of a typical rq agn and is 0.65dex more luminous at 2kev , which is equivalent to emitting about 30% of its bolometric luminosity between kev .      to compute theoretically the emerging spectrum of an accretion disk , both an accurate representation of the vertical structure of the disk and a suitable approximation for the radiation transfer are necessary .",
    "@xcite , for example , computes the balmer - line emission from the outer , optically thin parts of the accretion disks of cataclysmic variables , assuming a vertically homogeneous disk and local termodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "this paper finds that the outer regions of the disk cool through line emission ( with @xmath244% of the locally available viscous energy emitted as h@xmath42 ) , producing the balmer - line series with small balmer decrements ( @xmath245 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the observed balmer - line decrements range between 3 and 4 for the four low - redshift _ chandra _ targets ( for which both h@xmath42 and h@xmath38 fall within the sdss wavelength coverage ) similar to the balmer decrement of 3.2 which is considered typical for the blr gas .    assuming a homogeneous photoionized disk , @xcite and @xcite argued that standard accretion disks in agns can produce low - ionization lines with characteristics similar to those observed in the blrs of agns ( including steeper balmer - line decrements ) if the disk is externally illuminated .",
    "the lines arise in the radiatively excited skin of the inner ( @xmath246 ) accretion disk or the radiatively heated body of the outer ( @xmath247 ) disk .",
    "the need for external illumination of the accretion disk is an important constraint on models aiming to explain the existence of double - peaked balmer lines in agns .",
    "we can use the ratio of the h@xmath42 luminosity to the viscous power available locally in the line - emitting region of the disk , @xmath248 , in comparison with the @xcite computations , to estimate the need for external illumination .",
    "the viscous power available locally in the line - emitting region of the disk , @xmath249 , can be estimated using an estimate of the bolometric luminosity and the extent of the emission - line region as described in , e.g. , e03 and s06 . in this work",
    "we use the bolometric luminosity estimates based on the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) presented in   [ bollum ] .",
    "e03 and s06 have found that for most double - peaked emitters @xmath248 ranges between 0.1 and 3 .",
    "the @xmath248 ratios for the five double - peaked emitters studied here are shown in figure  [ power ] in comparison to the 20 double - peaked emitters from table  7 of e03 .",
    "note that the apparent anti - correlation seen in this figure is just a consequence of the fact that @xmath249 is derived from the bolometric luminosity which correlates with the x - ray flux . for @xmath250 , the energy released locally by viscous dissipation can not power the observed line even in principle .",
    "this is the case for one of our _ chandra _ targets , sdssj1004@xmath54801 , and 7 out of the 20 ( 35% ) double - peaked emitters presented by e03 .",
    "three of the remaining four _ chandra _ double - peaked emitters ( as well as 9 out of the 20 e03 sources ) have @xmath251 .",
    "thus , the observed h@xmath42 luminosities are uncomfortably close to the total energy available locally , and larger than the 20% upper limit of @xcite , suggesting that external illumination plays a role .",
    "the only exception is the most luminous sdss double - peaked emitter , sdssj2125@xmath10813 ; for a standard h@xmath42 to h@xmath38 luminosity ratio of 3.2 , the measured @xmath252 corresponds to @xmath253 , and no external illumination is necessary .",
    "the total soft - band x - ray luminosity is a factor of 1030 higher than the h@xmath42 luminosities for all five double - peaked emitters ( and ranges between  0.7 and 100 for the e03 sources ) , showing that enough energy is released within a few @xmath254 of the black hole to illuminate the balmer - line - emitting portion of the disk and produce line - emission with the observed strength .    assuming that the disk is photoionized and a thin skin emits the lines , the h@xmath42 power depends on the illuminating flux and the reprocessing efficiency ( i.e. , what fraction of the cooling comes out as h@xmath42 ) .",
    "@xcite show that , in the case of a photoionized disk , about 20% of the  effective continuum power \" , defined as @xmath255 , could be emitted as h@xmath42 . in all five cases studied here ,",
    "the h@xmath42-line luminosities are equal ( in the case of sdssj1238@xmath55325 ) or much smaller ( by factors of 7 , 6 , 16 , and 66 , respectively , for the remaining four cases in order of increasing ra ) than 20% of the effective continuum power .",
    "we conclude that external illumination is necessary in at least four of the five cases studied here , since the locally available viscous energy is insufficient and the balmer - line decrements too steep , compared to the @xcite predictions .",
    "a photoionized disk as described in e.g. , @xcite , can produce h@xmath42-line emission of the observed strength with the proper balmer - line decrements .      based on the x - ray spectral fits presented in ",
    "[ analysis ] , large column density neutral absorbers are ruled out in all cases . as a simple test for the presence of ionized absorbers ,",
    "we added one or more edges at @xmath256kev to all model fits ; this failed to improve the fits at significance levels @xmath257% in all cases , with the exception of sdssj0132@xmath10952 .",
    "sdssj0132@xmath10952 ( see   [ spec6770 ] ) , requires ionized intrinsic absorption with @xmath258@xmath57 and @xmath259ergs@xmath63 cm , but both quantities are poorly constrained .",
    "silimarly , although not required by the data , the limited signal - to - noise ratio in the case of sdssj2125@xmath10813 allows for the addition of a @xmath260@xmath57 , @xmath261ergs@xmath63 cm ionized intrinsic absorber .",
    "recent work by @xcite casts doubt on the suitability of a riaf to illuminate efficiently the outer portions of the accretion disk , suggesting instead that the required illumination can be provided by low lorentz factor ( @xmath262 ) jets in rl objects or slow outflows in the case of rq double - peaked emitters .",
    "if slow - moving outflows in the immediate vicinity of the black holes are responsible for the disk illumination , then x - ray observations are expected to show large x - ray absorbing columns : @xmath263@xmath57 , providing a suitable scattering depth of @xmath264 , according to @xcite . as an example of the prevalence of suitable ionized absorbers in agns , @xcite",
    "cite the work of @xcite , who found that 20 out of the 45 agns in their sample show signs of ionized absorption ( parameterized by @xmath265kev absorption edges in 16 of the 20 cases with @xmath266 , and xspec _ absori _ fits in the remaining 4 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the four rq double - peaked emitters studied here do not require large column density ionized absorbers , with the exception of sdssj0132@xmath10952 , where a lower column - density absorber is present , and sdssj2125@xmath10813 , where a high column - density and ionization absorber could not be ruled out .",
    "snapshot survey presented here has yielded spectra with a limited numbers of counts and was not designed to provide stringent constraints on the column densities and ionization states of possible ionized absorbers , but the presence of such absorbers appears unlikely in at least two of the four rq objects from the current sample .",
    "if high column density absorbers were common in double - peaked emitters as a class , we might also expect that the uv - to - x - ray indices measured based on x - ray photometry ( e.g. , s06 ) should reflect this by showing steeper @xmath208 distributions ( since the measured x - ray fluxes would be depressed by absorption ) .",
    "in fact , as argued above , the double - peaked emitters tend to have flatter @xmath208 values than similar optical / uv luminosity agns , suggesting excess x - ray emission relative to the uv emission .",
    "we conclude that the slow - outflow model of @xcite could provide the illumination necessary to power the strong double - peaked lines observed in some double - peaked emitters , but is unlikely to be responsible for the necessary extra power in all cases .",
    "the five double - peaked emitters observed with _",
    "chandra _ show diverse properties in the x - ray band .",
    "their kev emission is well fit by simple power laws ; the power - law emission is modified by intrinsic absorption in the case of sdssj0132@xmath10952 .",
    "the measured power - law photon indices , @xmath186 , are typical for similar luminosity agns , with the exception of the most optically luminous object , sdssj2125@xmath10813 .",
    "the kev spectrum of sdssj2125@xmath10813 is either absorbed , or has an unusually flat slope of @xmath2 , and possible k@xmath42 emission .",
    "the soft x - ray emission is strongly variable on timescales of years , but no short term ( minutes ) variability is detected , as expected for snapshot observations of similar x - ray luminosity agns .",
    "the optical fluxes and h@xmath42-line fluxes also vary strongly on long timescales , with stronger variability amplitudes than typical agn observed in the optical .",
    "the four rq double - peaked emitters have strong x - ray emission ( with about 30% of the total flux emitted in the kev band ) relative to their estimated monochromatic luminosities at 2500 , and statistically flatter uv - to - x - ray spectral indices .",
    "they all show a classical bbb in the extreme uv , suggesting the absence of riafs",
    ". external illumination of the accretion disk is necessary to produce balmer - line emission of the observed strength in at least four of the five cases ( with the exception of the most luminous sdss double - peaked emitter sdssj2125@xmath10813 ) , and the excess x - ray emission could supply the extra energy although it is still unclear how the accretion disk will intercept a sizable fraction of the soft x - ray emission .",
