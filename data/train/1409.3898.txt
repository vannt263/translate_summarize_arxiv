    "in order to reliably compute , it is necessary to protect information against noise . for quantum computations",
    ", this is particularly challenging because noise in the form of decoherence threatens the very quantum nature of the process .",
    "adding redundancy by encoding information into a quantum error - correcting code is a natural , conceptually appealing approach towards building noise - resilient scalable computers based on imperfect hardware .    among the known quantum error - correcting codes",
    ", the class of so - called topological codes stands out .",
    "examples in 2d include the toric code and quantum double models  @xcite , the surface codes  @xcite , the 2d color codes  @xcite , variants of these codes  @xcite , and the levin - wen model  @xcite . in 3d ,",
    "known examples are bombin and martin - delgado s 3d  color code  @xcite , as well as haah s  @xcite and michnicki s  @xcite models .",
    "these codes are attractive for a number of reasons : their code space is topologically protected , meaning that small local deformations or locally acting noise do not affect encoded information .",
    "the degree of this protection ( measured in information - theoretic notions in terms of code distance , and manifesting itself in physical properties such as gap stability ) scales with the system size : in other words , robustness essentially reduces to the question of scalability .",
    "finally , the code space of a topological code is the degenerate ground space of a geometrically local hamiltonian : this means that syndrome information can be extracted by local measurements , an important feature for actual realizations .",
    "furthermore , this implies that a topological code is essentially a phase of a many - body system and can be characterized in terms of its particle content , their statistics , and the quantum field theory emerging in the continuum limit . in particular",
    ", the quantum field theory provides a description of such systems which captures all universal features , independently of microscopic details .    while quantum error - correcting codes can provide the necessary protection of information against noise ,",
    "a further requirement for quantum computation is the ability to execute gates in a robust manner .",
    "again , topological codes stand out : they usually provide certain intrinsic mechanisms for executing gates in a robust way .",
    "more precisely , there are sequences of local code deformations , under which the information stays encoded in a code with macroscopic distance , but undergoes some unitary transformation . in principle , this provides a robust implementation of computations by sequences of local , and hence , potentially experimentally realizable actions . in the case of @xmath2-topological codes described by topological quantum field theories",
    ", this corresponds to adiabatic movement ( braiding ) of quasi - particle excitations ( also called anyons ) .",
    "unfortunately , as is well known , braiding ( by which we mean the movement either around each other or more generally around non - trivial loops ) of anyons does not always give rise to a universal gate set .",
    "rather , the set of gates is model - dependent : braiding of @xmath3-anyons generates only global phases on the sphere , and elements of the pauli group on non - zero genus surfaces .",
    "braiding of ising anyons gives clifford gates , whereas braiding of fibonacci anyons generates a dense subgroup of the set of unitaries ( and is therefore universal within suitable subspaces of the code space ) .",
    "in other words , braiding alone , without additional tricks such as magic state distillation  @xcite ( which has a large overhead  @xcite ) , is not in general sufficient to provide universal fault - tolerant computation ; unfortunately , the known systems with universal braiding behavior are of a rather complex nature , requiring e.g. , 12-body interactions among spins  @xcite . even ignoring the question of universality",
    ", the use of braiding has some potentially significant drawbacks : in general ( for non - abelian anyons ) , it requires an amount of time which scales with the system size ( or code distance ) to execute a single logical gate .",
    "( mathematically , this is reflected by the fact that string - operators can not be implemented in constant depth for general non - abelian anyon models  in contrast to e.g. , the toric code . )",
    "this implies that error - correction steps will be necessary even during the execution of such a gate ( see e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent discussion of the robustness of braiding ) .",
    "this may pose an additional technological challenge , for example , if the intermediate topologies are different .",
    "given the limitations of braiding , it is natural to look for other mechanisms for implementing robust gates in topological codes .",
    "for stabilizer quantum codes , the notion of transversal gates has traditionally been used almost synonymously with fault - tolerant gates : their key feature is the fact that they do not propagate physical errors . more generally ,",
    "for topological stabilizer codes , we can consider logical gates implementable by constant - depth quantum circuits as a proxy for robust gates : they can increase the weight of a physical error only by a constant , and are thus sufficiently robust when combined with suitable error - correction gadgets . note that finite - depth local circuits represent a much broader class than transversal gates .",
    "gate restrictions on transversal , as well as constant - depth local circuits have been obtained for stabilizer and more general codes .",
    "eastin and knill  @xcite argued that for any code protected against local errors , transversal gates can only generate a finite group and therefore do not provide universality .",
    "bravyi and knig  @xcite consider the group of logical gates that may be implemented by such constant - depth local circuits on geometrically local topological stabilizer codes .",
    "they found that such gates are contained in @xmath4 , the @xmath5-th level of the clifford hierarchy , where @xmath5 is the spatial dimension in which the stabilizer code is geometrically local .    in this work",
    ", we characterize the set of gates implementable by a locality - preserving unitary in a system described by a 2d  tqft . by doing so ,",
    "we both specialize and generalize the results of  @xcite : we restrict our attention to dimension  @xmath6 , but go beyond the set of local stabilizer codes in two significant ways .",
    "first , we obtain statements which are independent of the particular realization ( e.g. , the toric code model ) but are instead phrased in terms of the tqft ( i.e. , the anyon model describing the system ) . in this way , we obtain a characterization which holds for a gapped phase of matter , rather than just for a particular code representing that phase . on a conceptual level , this is similar in spirit to the work of  @xcite , where statements on the computational power for measurement - based quantum computation were obtained that hold throughout a certain phase . here",
    "we use the term phase loosely  we say that two systems are in the same phase if they have the same particle content . to avoid having to make any direct reference to an underlying lattice model , we replace the notion of a constant - depth local circuit by the more general notion of a locality - preserving unitary : this is a unitary operation which maps local operators to local ones .",
    "second , our results and techniques also apply to non - abelian anyon models ( whereas stabilizer codes only realize certain abelian models , unless e.g. , domain walls or ` twists ' are added  @xcite that break homogeneity ) . in particular",
    ", we obtain statements that can be applied , e.g. , to the levin - wen models  @xcite , as well as chiral phases . for such systems , restrictions on protected gates",
    "were previously not known .",
    "again , knowledge of the underlying microscopic model is unnecessary to apply our results , which only depend on the type of anyons present in the system .",
    "our approach relates locality - preserving unitaries to certain symmetries of the underlying anyon model ; this imposes constraints on the allowed operations .",
    "we consider the fibonacci and ising models as paradigmatic examples and find that there are no non - trivial gates in the former , and only pauli operations in the latter case .",
    "our focus on these anyons models is for concreteness only , but our methods and conclusions apply more generally .",
    "some of our more general conclusions are that    a.   protected gates generically ( see section  [ sec : equivalenceclasses ] discussing the necessity of certain technical assumptions ) form only a finite group and b.   when the representation of the mapping class group is computationally universal ( i.e. , forms a dense subgroup ) , then there are no non - trivial protected gates .    our observations are summarized in table  [ tab : braiding_vs_locality_preserving_gates ] . according to our results , the class of locality - preserving unitaries ( which is distinguished from the point of view of error correction ) is too restricted and needs to be supplemented with alternative mechanisms to achieve universality .    .",
    "we study different anyon models ( first column ) .",
    "the second column describes the properties of the unitary group generated by the ( projective ) representation of the mapping class group ( see section  [ sec : mcg ] )  this corresponds to braiding for punctured spheres .",
    "the third column characterizes the set of protected gates .",
    "our results suggest a trade - off between the computational power of the mapping class group representation and that of gates implementable by locality - preserving unitaries . [ cols= \" < , < ,",
    "< \" , ]     finally , let us comment on limitations , as well as open problems arising from our work .",
    "the first and most obvious one is the dimensionality of the systems under consideration : our methods apply only to @xmath2  tqfts .",
    "the mathematics of higher - dimensional tqfts is less developed , and currently an active research area ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "while the techniques of  @xcite , which have recently been significantly strengthened by pastawski and yoshida  @xcite , also apply to higher - dimensional codes ( such as haah s ) , they are restricted to the stabilizer formalism ( but importantly ,  @xcite also obtain statements for subsystem codes ) .",
    "obtaining non - abelian analogues of our results in higher dimensions appears to be a challenging research problem .",
    "a full characterization of the case @xmath7 is particularly desirable from a technological viewpoint .    even in @xmath2 ,",
    "there are obvious limitations of our results : the systems we consider are essentially `` homogenous '' lattices with anyonic excitations in the bulk .",
    "we are not considering defect lines , or condensation of anyons at boundaries ; for example , our discussion excludes the quantum double models constructed in  @xcite , which have domain walls constructed from condensation at boundaries using the folding trick .",
    "again , we expect that obtaining statements on protected gates for these models requires additional technology in the form of more refined categorical notions , as discussed by kitaev and kong  @xcite .",
    "also , although we identify possible locality preserving logical unitaries , our arguments do not show that these can necessarily be realized , either in general tqfts or in specific models that realize tqfts .",
    "lastly , our work is based on the ( physically motivated ) assumption that a tqft description is possible and the underlying data is given .",
    "for a concrete lattice model of interacting spins , the problem of identifying this description ( or associated invariants  @xcite ) , as well as constructing the relevant string - operators ( as has been done for quantum double models  @xcite as well as the levin - wen models  @xcite ) , is a problem in its own right .      our results concern families of systems defined on any @xmath6-dimensional orientable manifold ( surface )  @xmath8 , which we will take to be closed unless otherwise stated .",
    "typically , such a family is defined in terms of some local physical degrees of freedom ( spins ) associated with sites of a lattice embedded in  @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to the joint hilbert space  @xmath9 of these spins as the ` physical ' hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian  @xmath10 on  @xmath9 is local , i.e. , it consists only of interactions between `` neighbors '' within constant - diameter regions on the lattice . more generally , assuming a suitable metric on  @xmath8 is chosen",
    ", we may define locality in terms of the distance measure on  @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in the ground space  @xmath11 of @xmath10 .",
    "for a topologically ordered system , this ground space is degenerate with dimension growing exponentially with the genus of  @xmath8 , and is therefore suitable for storing and manipulating quantum information",
    ". we will give a detailed description of this space below ( see section  [ sec : tqftbackground ] ) ; it has a preferred basis consisting of labelings associated with some set  @xmath12 .",
    "this is a finite set characterizing all distinct types of anyonic quasiparticle excitations of  @xmath10 in the relevant low energy sector of @xmath9 .",
    "importantly , the form of  @xmath11 is independent of the microscopic details ( in the definition of @xmath10 ) : it is fully determined by the associated tqft . in mathematical terms , it can be described in terms of the data of a modular tensor category , which also describes fusion , braiding and twists of the anyons .",
    "we will refer to  @xmath11 as the tqft hilbert space .",
    "the significance of  @xmath11 is that it is protected : local observables can not distinguish between states belonging to  @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 is an error - correcting code with the property that local regions are correctable : any operator supported in a small region which preserves the code space must act trivially on it ( otherwise it could be used to distinguish between ground states ) .    to compute fault - tolerantly , one would like to operate on information encoded in the code space  @xmath11 by acting with a unitary @xmath14 on the physical degrees of freedom which map between _ different _ systems  @xmath9 and @xmath15 . by a slight modification of the arguments here ,",
    "we could then obtain restrictions on locality - preserving isomorphisms ( instead of automorphisms , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : nonabelian ] ) .",
    "such a scenario was discussed in  @xcite in the context of stabilizer codes .",
    "here we restrict to the case where the systems ( and associated ground spaces ) are identical for simplicity , since the main conclusions are identical . ] .",
    "there are a number of features that are desirable for such a unitary to be useful ",
    "physical realizability being an obvious one . for fault - tolerance , two conditions are particularly natural :    a.   the unitary @xmath16 should preserve the code space , @xmath17 so that the information stays encoded .",
    "we call a unitary @xmath16 with this property an automorphism of the code and denote its restriction to @xmath11 by @xmath18}:{\\mathcal{h}}_\\sigma\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{h}}_\\sigma$ ]",
    ". the action  @xmath18}$ ] defines the logical operation or gate that @xmath16 realizes .",
    "b.   typical errors should remain correctable under the application of the unitary  @xmath16 . in the context of topological codes , which correct sufficiently local errors , and where a local error model is usually assumed ,",
    "this condition is satisfied if @xmath16 does not significantly change the locality properties of an operator : if an operator @xmath19 has support on a region  @xmath20 , then the support of @xmath21 is contained within a constant - size neighborhood of  @xmath22 .",
    "we call such a unitary a locality - preserving unitary",
    ".    we call a unitary @xmath16 satisfying  ( i ) and ( ii ) a locality - preserving unitary automorphism of the code ( or simply a topologically protected gate ) .",
    "our goal is to characterize the set of logical operations that have the form  @xmath18}$ ] for some locality - preserving .",
    "the latter can be defined as follows : if the support of an operator @xmath19 is contained in a region  @xmath20 which deformation retracts to a closed curve  @xmath23 , then the support of  @xmath24 must be contained in a region  @xmath25 which deformation retracts to a curve  @xmath26 in the same homology class as  @xmath23 .",
    "for example , for a translation - invariant system , translating by a possibly extensive amount realizes such a homology - preserving ( but not locality - preserving ) automorphism . ]",
    "unitary automorphism  @xmath16 .",
    "for example , if @xmath13 is a topologically ordered subspace of @xmath9 , the hilbert space of a spin lattice , then ( ii ) is satisfied if @xmath16 is a constant - depth local circuit .",
    "another important example is the constant - time evolution @xmath27 $ ] of a system through a bounded - strength geometrically - local hamiltonian @xmath28 . here ,",
    "lieb - robinson bounds @xcite provide quantitative statements on how the resulting unitary may be exponentially well approximated by a locality - preserving unitary .",
    "this is relevant since it describes the time evolution of a physical system and can also be used to model adiabatic transformations of the hamiltonian @xcite .    from a computational point of view",
    ", the group @xmath29}\\ |\\ u\\textrm { locality - preserving unitary automorphism } \\right\\}\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] generated by such gates is of particular interest : it determines the computational power of gates that are implementable fault - tolerantly with locality preserving automorphisms .      in section  [ sec :",
    "tqftbackground ] , we provide a brief introduction to the relevant concepts of tqfts .",
    "we then derive our main results on the characterization of protected gates in section  [ sec : nonabelian ] .",
    "further restrictions on the allowed protected gates are provided in sections  [ sec : glblmcg ] and [ sec : globalconstraintsfmove ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "examplesnonabelian ] , we apply our results to particular models , deriving in particular our characterizations for ising and fibonacci anyons .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : abelianmodels ] we use additional properties of abelian models to show that their protected gates must be contained within a proper subgroup of the generalized clifford group , which is similar to the result of  @xcite , but goes further .",
    "in this section , we provide the necessary background on topological quantum field theories ( tqfts )",
    ". our discussion will be rather brief ; for a more detailed discussion of topological quantum computation and anyons , we refer to  @xcite . following witten s work  @xcite",
    ", tqfts have been axiomatized by atiyah  @xcite based on segal s work  @xcite on conformal field theories .",
    "moore and seiberg  @xcite derived the relations satisfied by the basic algebraic data of such theories ( or more precisely , a modular functor ) .",
    "here we borrow some of the terminology developed in full generality by walker  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "for a thorough treatment of the category - theoretic concepts , we recommend the appendix of  @xcite .",
    "our focus is on the hilbert space  @xmath13 spanned by the vacuum states of a tqft defined on the orientable surface  @xmath8 .",
    "recall that this is generally a subspace  @xmath30 of a hilbert space of physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the tqft is specified by a finite set of anyon labels @xmath31 , their _ fusion rules _ ( described using a non - negative integer @xmath32 for each triple of anyons @xmath33 , called fusion multiplicities ) , along with @xmath34 , @xmath1 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 matrices ( complex valued matrices with columns and rows indexed by anyon labels ) .",
    "if the tqft arises from taking continuous limits of a local hamiltonian model such as the toric code , the anyons are simply the elementary excitations of the model , and the fusion rules and matrices can be understood in terms of creating , combining , moving and annihilating anyons in the surface .",
    "the anyon set must contain a trivial particle @xmath37 such that when combined with any particle , the latter remains unchanged @xmath38 , and each particle @xmath39 must have an antiparticle @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "we will restrict our attention to models where @xmath42 for all @xmath43 for simplicity ( our results generalize with only minor modifications ) .",
    "we are interested in the algebra @xmath44 of operators @xmath45 which preserve the subspace @xmath13 .",
    "we call such an element @xmath46 an automorphism and denote by @xmath47}:{\\mathcal{h}}_{\\sigma}\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{h}}_{\\sigma}$ ] the restriction to @xmath13 .",

    "is represented by the identity operator  @xmath50 on the whole space  @xmath9 .",
    "our constraints on protected gates are derived by studying how they transform certain operators acting on  @xmath51 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : topologicalloops ] ) . to define the latter ,",

    "( the set of labels  @xmath12 is determined by the underlying model . )",
    "then there is a `` string - operator '' @xmath54 acting on @xmath9 , supported in a constant - diameter neighborhood of  @xmath23 .",
    "it corresponds to the process of creating a particle - antiparticle - pair @xmath55 , moving @xmath56 along  @xmath23 , and subsequently fusing to the vacuum .",
    "the last step in this process involves projection onto the ground space , which is not trivial in general : the operator  @xmath54 can involve post - selection , in which case it is a non - unitary element of  @xmath44 .    the operators @xmath57 form a closed subalgebra  @xmath58 : they preserve the ground space and satisfy @xmath59 for the fusion multiplicities  @xmath60 ( see section  [ sec : verlinde ] ) .",
    "in addition , reversing the direction of @xmath23 , i.e. , considering @xmath61 , is equivalent to exchanging the particle with its antiparticle , i.e. , @xmath62 here @xmath63 is an involution on the set of particle labels  @xmath12 , again defined by the underlying model .",
