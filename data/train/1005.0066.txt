    "in the past three decades , a series of the observations of s - wave , p - wave and d - wave charmonia make charmonium family abundant .",
    "nowadays , charm physics is still an intriguing research field with challenges and opportunities @xcite .",
    "especially , the study of charmonium may provide valuable information on non - perturbative qcd effects .    as an important and effective approach to deeply learn the underlying properties of charmonium ,",
    "charmonium decay is an extensively focused research topic . among the observed charmonium states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are of abundant experimental information of decay just listed in particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental measurement relevant to the decay of p - wave charmonium is far less than that of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , more experimental and theoretical explorations of p - wave charmonium decay are becoming active , especially with the running of bes - iii .",
    "recently , the bes - iii collaboration announced its observations of @xmath5 decaying into two light vector mesons @xcite . among these decay modes of @xmath6 to two light vector mesons , the ozi suppressed processes @xmath7 and the double - ozi suppressed process @xmath8 were firstly observed . in order to explain the evasion of the helicity selection rule in these processes , the hadronic loop effect , an important non - perturbative effect relevant to the decay of charmonia @xcite and molecular system @xcite ,",
    "is introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , which also indicate that applying the hadronic loop mechanism to other @xmath6 decays will be helpful to further test the hadronic loop effect on @xmath6 decay .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radiative decays of charmonia @xmath3 and @xmath6 into light meson are studied by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach , where a complete numerical calculation for the quark - gluon loop diagrams was performed .",
    "the obtained theoretical results for @xmath9 can well reproduce the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratios of @xmath10 were predicted , which are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in 2008 ,",
    "the radiative decays of @xmath6 were first measured by the cleo collaboration using a total of @xmath14 decays of the @xmath4 collected with the cleo - c detector @xcite .",
    "the reported results are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "one notices that the experimental results of the branching ratios of @xmath18 are an order magnitude larger than the corresponding theoretical predictions @xcite .    the above difference between the experimental measurement from cleo and the theoretical result calculated in pqcd shows that there should exist the extra effect on the @xmath2 radiative decays into a light vector meson , which stimulates our interest in exploring the underlying mechanism to resolve this large discrepancy between the theoretical prediction by pqcd @xcite and the experimental measurement by cleo @xcite .",
    "as indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the hadronic loop effect can explain the experimental observation of the ozi suppressed processes @xmath19 and the double - ozi suppressed process @xmath8 well . in this work , we extend the hadronic loop effect to @xmath20 ( @xmath1 ) process to answer whether large discrepancy between the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurement of @xmath0 can be alleviated .",
    "@xmath0 is similar to @xmath21 since both processes occur via the intermediate charmed mesons under considering the hadronic loop effect .",
    "what is more important of this work is to offer an effective approach to test the proposed hadronic loop effect applied to explain @xmath21 decay processes .",
    "the paper is organized as following .",
    "after the introduction , we present the formula of the hadronic loop contributions to @xmath2 radiative decays to a light vector meson , which includes the effective lagrangian employed in this work and the decay amplitudes . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the numerical results of @xmath22 are given .",
    "the last section is the discussion and conclusion .",
    "as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nonperturbative qcd mechanism , i.e. , hadronic loop effect , may play a crucial role in understanding @xmath2 decay . in table .",
    "[ fig : gpept-1 ] , the typical diagram depicting the hadronic loop effect on @xmath0 at quark level is given , which is different from the quark - gluon loop diagrams depicting @xmath20 at pqcd approach in ref .",
    "the transition element of @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath23=\\sum_i \\langle \\gamma v|\\mathcal{h}^{(2)}|i\\rangle \\langle i |\\mathcal{h}^{(1)}|\\chi_{c1}\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reflects the intermediate state contribution to @xmath0 . here",
    ", @xmath24 represents the interaction of @xmath2 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 describes interaction @xmath27 by exchanging an appropriate charmed meson .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with the above preparation , the radiative decays of @xmath2 to a light vector meson are estimated . as a free parameter , @xmath28",
    "is introduced in the cutoff @xmath29 of the form factors , which is usually dependent on the particular process and taken to be of the order of unity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiative ] , we present the branching ratios of @xmath30 dependent on the parameter @xmath28 . for comparing with the experimental data @xcite , the theoretical result includes the hadronic loop contribution obtained in this work and the pqcd estimation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiative ] , there exists overlap between the numerical result obtained in this work and the experimental data announced by cleo .",
    "the corresponding @xmath28 ranges for @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , which are in the reasonable parameter space .",
    "especially , we need to emphasize that there exists a common @xmath28 range @xmath35 for @xmath36 radiative decays .",
    "as an important non - perturbative qcd effect , the hadronic loop mechanism was proposed in studying @xmath3 and @xmath37 decays @xcite . by using this mechanism ,",
    "the ozi suppressed processes @xmath38 with @xmath39 and the double - ozi process @xmath40 announced by bes - iii were explained well in the recent work @xcite .",
    "the cleo collaboration announced the experimental results of @xmath0 in 2008 @xcite , which are an order magnitude larger than the corresponding theoretical estimations calculated by pqcd @xcite . to search for the source of the discrepancy between the pqcd calculation @xcite and the cleo data @xcite for @xmath0 , in this work we propose the hadronic loop contribution to @xmath0 . under the hadronic loop mechanism ,",
    "@xmath0 is similar to @xmath41 process , both of which occur via the intermediate @xmath42 just shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpept-1 ] . to some extent , the study of this work can be as a test for the hadronic loop effect , which was applied to explain @xmath38 decays @xcite .",
    "our numerical result of @xmath0 indicates that the theoretical result including the hadronic loop contribution and the result in pqcd calculation for @xmath0 can reach up to the experimental data of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , non - perturbative qcd effect , i.e. , hadronic loop mechanism , can be as the underlying source to alleviate the difference between the pqcd calculation and the cleo data of @xmath0 . as indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the hadronic loop effect also plays an important role to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the success of explaining @xmath21 and @xmath0 under the hadronic loop mechanism not only tests the model itself , but also shows that the non - perturbative effect on @xmath2 is important .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies of @xmath6 decay are encouraged .",
