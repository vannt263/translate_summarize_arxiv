    "the interest in black - hole analogues has been mainly driven by the intriguing possibility of observing hawking radiation in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the experimental challenges , this pursuit has important theory implications because of the well - known weakness in the derivation of the hawking effect for real black holes  @xcite . hawking s semi - classical calculation  @xcite is based on a consideration of fields that are assumed to have no appreciable gravitational effect compared to the black hole , but the derivation contradicts this assumption because the fields attain arbitrarily high frequencies ( and therefore energies ) at the horizon .",
    "this so - called trans - planckian problem reveals the lack of any proper understanding of quantum - gravitational effects .",
    "unfortunately , the question of whether black holes really radiate does not seem to be amenable to experimental investigation because such radiation would be completely swamped by the cosmic microwave background .",
    "in black - hole analogues the trans - planckian problem is avoided by dispersion that limits the blue - shifting of waves at horizons  @xcite .",
    "the hawking effect has been found to persist even in the presence of dispersion  @xcite , although in general numerical simulations must be resorted to in order to verify this .",
    "the lack of a good understanding of the hawking effect with arbitrary dispersion is an important and presumably solvable problem , whereas a proper understanding of the hawking effect in real black holes requires unknown physics to deal with the infinite blue - shifting .",
    "analogue systems therefore provide the opportunity to understand the hawking effect using known physics and to verify it experimentally ; neither of these tasks can be achieved with real black holes .",
    "the introduction of dispersion into the hawking effect opens up a variety of new possibilities .",
    "indeed , one of the lessons of analogue systems is that the physics of horizons , including the hawking effect , has a breadth and richness that is not immediately apparent from the case of real black holes .",
    "one can consider white - hole and black - hole horizons  @xcite , that both give rise to the hawking effect ; horizons allow the blue - shifting and red - shifting of probe waves  @xcite ; depending on the dispersion , the probe waves can bounce back at horizons , or go straight through , or bounce back and forth a number of times ( see below ) ; two horizons can communicate leading to runaway quantum hawking radiation or a classical instability  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the least exotic black - hole analogue that has been proposed is that of surface waves on a moving fluid .",
    "schtzhold and unruh  @xcite showed that long - wavelength surface waves in a shallow moving fluid obey the klein - gordon equation in a curved space - time geometry . by varying the flow speed so that it exceeds the wave group velocity in some region , one produces a horizon .",
    "close to the horizon the long - wavelength assumption breaks down and the detailed behaviour is governed by the dispersion ; the wave evolution is no longer described by an effective space - time metric and there is therefore no trans - planckian problem of infinite blue - shifting .",
    "further results for surface waves from an analogue - gravity perspective were given in  @xcite .",
    "recently , we performed experiments to investigate the behaviour of surface waves at a white - hole horizon , using water waves in a wave tank with a counter - flow  @xcite .",
    "the speed of the counter - flow was varied along the tank by the presence of a sloping region on the bottom .",
    "figure  [ horizoninfluid ] shows how waves propagating against the flow are blocked at the point where the counter - current reaches the group velocity of the wave ; this blocking line is the white - hole horizon .",
    "video of the incoming wave was used to produce the space - time diagram in figure  [ blueshifting ] ( note that the directions of the flow and the wave are reversed in the plot of figure  [ blueshifting ] compared to figure  [ horizoninfluid ] ) .",
    "the linear features with positive slope in the space - time diagram are the evolution of the wave crests and troughs in time  the world - lines of the crests and troughs .",
    "the inverse @xmath1 of the slope of the world - lines gives the speed of the crests and troughs , the phase velocity @xmath2 of the wave since the phase is @xmath3 ; the lines curve upward as the wave reaches the white - hole horizon , showing a decrease in the phase velocity .",
    "the wavelength in the laboratory is revealed by drawing a horizontal line in the diagram and measuring the distance between two crests ; because of the curving upward of the crest world - lines , the wavelength is seen to decrease as the horizon is approached .",
    "this is the characteristic wavelength - shortening (  blue - shifting \" ) of waves at a white - hole horizon , also observed in an optical analogue  @xcite .",
    "the inset in figure  [ blueshifting ] shows the behaviour of rays at a white - hole horizon where there is no dispersion ; the rays stick at the horizon which corresponds to an infinite blue - shifting of the waves ( the trans - planckian problem ) .",
    "it is the dispersion of the surface waves that limits the amount of blue - shifting at the horizon ; in this paper we will discuss some of the rich set of possible behaviours .",
    "not surprisingly , the blocking of waves by a counter - flow that exceeds the wave group velocity is a phenomenon that is well - known in the fluid - mechanics community  @xcite .",
    "the blue - shifting of waves at the blocking line ( white - hole horizon ) is also well - known and has been investigated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "there is however another possible process in the interaction of a wave with a counter - flow , one that does not seem to have been considered by the fluid - mechanics community , even though it is a possibility clearly visible in the dispersion relation  @xcite : this process is the hawking effect . in a stationary flow , where the flow speed at each point in the tank is constant in time but varies from point to point",
    ", the frequency in the laboratory frame of a surface wave on the flow is conserved .",
    "as we have seen , the wavelength in the laboratory is not conserved , so a white - hole horizon converts the wavelength of a wave propagating against the flow to a different wavelength while conserving its frequency in the laboratory .",
    "figure  [ blueshifting ] is an example of such a wave ; it is right - moving against the flow ( ingoing against the flow ) with positive ( angular ) frequency @xmath4 and positive wave number @xmath5 and the horizon increases @xmath5 while keeping @xmath4 fixed .",
    "an important quantity is the frequency of the wave in a frame co - moving with the flow ; this co - moving frequency is not conserved , but the ingoing wave and the blue - shifted wave with higher @xmath5 both have positive co - moving frequencies  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there is often a solution of the dispersion relation for the fixed positive input frequency @xmath4 that has a _ negative _ @xmath5 and a _ negative _ co - moving frequency  @xcite .",
    "the laboratory frequency @xmath4 of the input wave must be conserved in the wave evolution but when there is a wave with negative co - moving frequency at same value of @xmath4 , there exists the possibility that it could be generated in the interaction of the input wave with the counter - flow . these waves with negative co - moving frequency would be produced in addition to the blue - shifted waves with positive co - moving frequency ; this process is the hawking effect , which is at root a classical effect , although with extraordinary quantum implications  @xcite .",
    "the strangest feature of the hawking effect is that it is an amplification of the ingoing wave , an extraction of energy from the flow ( or from whatever background creates the horizon ) .",
    "the famous quantum hawking radiation is a rather straightforward consequence of the classical hawking effect when the fields underlying the waves are quantized ( the role of input waves is then played by the quantum vacuum and the energy extraction in the hawking process allows the spontaneous creation of field quanta )  @xcite .    in our experiments described above  @xcite we observed indications of waves with negative co - moving frequency .",
    "numerical simulations indicated that the hawking effect would be unobservable in the regimes covered in the experiments  @xcite , but it is not clear how well the wave evolution was described by the theoretical model used in the simulations .",
    "it appears that our paper was the first experimental search for the hawking effect with surface waves , and further experiments are needed .",
    "we hope through this paper to increase awareness of the hawking effect among researchers in fluid mechanics by showing how it has been overlooked in the existing literature on wave blocking .",
    "complementary to this , we hope to show those familiar with horizon physics some of the rich horizon effects that occur in models of wave blocking that are used in fluid mechanics .",
    "such surprising connections between apparently disparate areas of physics ( and engineering ) are often a source of inspiration to both sides .",
    "it is important to stress that the model of surface waves considered in this paper is a linear one : the dynamics is given by a linear wave equation , but with a nonlinear dispersion relation .",
    "as is well known , surface waves behave non - linearly if the wave amplitude is large enough , and this presents a potential problem since the shortening of the wavelength at a horizon necessarily leads to an increase in the wave amplitude .",
    "the limiting of blue - shifting by dispersion also limits the amplitude increase at blocking lines and , for the linear model to be applicable , it is important that the wave amplitude not get too large .",
    "the maximum amplitude attained during the interaction with a counter - flow can to some extent be controlled through the amplitude of the incident wave , and dissipation ( see next paragraph ) also helps to limit the amplitude .",
    "the interaction of nonlinear waves with a counter - flow is a highly complex process that is not discussed here ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "also neglected in the model used below is the viscosity of the fluid , and this limits the accuracy of the results when wavelengths are blue - shifted down to very small ( capillary ) wavelengths since viscosity quickly damps such waves .",
    "but it is easy to make allowance for this latter drawback of the model by bearing in mind the limited propagation length of capillary waves .",
    "the subjects of black holes and water waves have a historical connection through the figure of pierre - simon de laplace . in his `` exposition",
    "du systme du monde '' in 1796 , laplace famously introduced the term _ toile sombre _ ( dark star ) to denote an object whose gravitational field is strong enough to prevent light from escaping ( the same concept had been described in 1783 by the reverend john michell in a letter to cavendish )  @xcite .",
    "laplace is also well known for having derived ( in 1775 ) a dispersion relation for surface waves on water  @xcite .",
    "when the water has a background flow ( which does not vary with depth ) and the effect of surface tension is included , the dispersion relation takes the form widely used in fluid mechanics to describe waves on moving water  @xcite : @xmath6 here @xmath4 is the ( angular ) frequency of the wave in the laboratory frame and @xmath5 the wave - number ; @xmath7 is the speed of the flow , @xmath8 the depth of the fluid , @xmath9 the gravitational constant , @xmath10 the fluid density and @xmath11 the surface tension . for water , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "equation ( [ disprel ] ) is a one - dimensional dispersion relation suitable for water - tank experiments .",
    "when the flow is stationary ( @xmath7 independent of time , but gradually varying in space ) , @xmath4 is a constant but @xmath5 varies with spatial position @xmath14 .",
    "waves described by ( [ disprel ] ) are a consequence of gravity ( @xmath9 ) and surface tension ( @xmath11 ) and are called gravity - capillary waves . for small @xmath5",
    "the gravity term dominates , which we call the gravity regime , whereas for large @xmath5 surface tension dominates , giving the capillary regime .",
    "the pure - gravity case corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the frequency in a frame co - moving with the fluid .",
    "hence the positive , respectively negative , square roots of ( [ disprel ] ) @xmath17 correspond to positive , respectively negative , co - moving frequencies . as described in the introduction , the hawking effect is the generation of a wave on the negative branch of ( [ disprel2 ] ) from a wave on the positive branch , through interaction with a counter - flow .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that in the extensive fluid - mechanics literature on the waves ( [ disprel ] ) , including the pure - gravity case @xmath15 , there seems never to have been any consideration of the possibility of conversion of waves from the positive to the negative branch of ( [ disprel2 ] ) through the blocking effect  @xcite .",
    "if such a conversion process had been investigated , the hawking effect would presumably have been ( re-)discovered in fluid mechanics .",
    "solutions of the dispersion relation ( [ disprel ] ) are usually represented graphically .",
    "we obtain from ( [ disprel2 ] ) @xmath18 figure  [ dispersion ] plots both branches of the right - hand side of ( [ disprel3 ] ) as functions of @xmath5 , for a fixed value of @xmath19 ; figure ( a ) shows the pure - gravity case ( @xmath15 ) and figure ( b ) shows the full dispersion relation with surface tension included .",

    "if the flow speed @xmath27 increases as the wave moves to the right ( @xmath7 becomes more negative ) the green and blue curves tip over clockwise about the origin ( as in figure  [ rays ] ) , so the root @xmath23 increases  the wave is blue - shifted .",
    "when the wave reaches a point where the flow speed has increased to make the roots @xmath23 and @xmath24 coalesce at a local maximum of the green curve , the group velocity of the wave is zero  it has been blocked at a white - hole horizon .",

    "the ingoing wave @xmath23 has thus been blue - shifted to @xmath24 by the white - hole horizon ; the blue - shifted wave @xmath24 has positive _ phase _ velocity , so its crests move to the right in the laboratory , but it has negative group velocity .",
    "the third real root of the dispersion relation with positive co - moving frequency ( green curve ) in figure  [ dispersion ]  ( a ) is @xmath25 ; this is simply a wave propagating in the same direction as the flow , to the left with negative phase and group velocities .",

    "the existence of conversion from @xmath23 to @xmath26 can not be deduced from dispersion plots , which only reveal it as a possibility .",
    "the amount of conversion of @xmath23 to @xmath26 depends on the details of the dispersion and the velocity profile @xmath20 . in simple cases involving limited dispersion the hawking effect",
    "is determined by the slope @xmath28 of @xmath7 at the horizon ( this slope is the analogue of the surface gravity of a black hole , the acceleration due to gravity at the horizon ) , but for general dispersion and velocity profiles no analytical formula for the size of the effect has been found and one must resort to numerical simulations of the wave evolution .",
    "one aspect of the challenge to find a good intuitive understanding of the hawking effect is apparent from the description of the horizon given above : this was taken as the point where the flow speed matched the group velocity of the blue - shifting wave .",
    "but the phase velocity of this wave is greater than its group velocity , so one can have a group - velocity horizon but no phase - velocity horizon . on the other hand",
    ", one can have both a group- and a phase - velocity horizon , with in principle an arbitrary distance between these two horizons and a completely different value of @xmath28 at each horizon .",
    "the size of the hawking effect is influenced by these and other factors .",
    "there is also the further possibility of having the maximum flow speed close to but less than that required for a group - velocity horizon .",

    "the case of waves with negative co - moving frequency has been included throughout ; these waves are crucial for the hawking effect and they have been neglected in the fluid - mechanics literature on wave blocking . the hawking effect is a remarkable process in which an incident wave generates a wave with negative co - moving frequency , with a resulting _ amplification _ of the incident wave ( this implies an extraction of energy from the flow ) . it has been shown that this process is robust in the presence of dispersion  @xcite and the linear theory of surface waves falls into the class of systems that exhibit the hawking effect  @xcite",
    ". experimental evidence of the generation of waves with negative co - moving frequency was reported in  @xcite and further experiments are planned .",
    "we presented analytical results for the deep water / short wavelength case @xmath0 that are more comprehensive than those given elsewhere .",
    "a similarity of the state space of the waves to that of a thermodynamic system was pointed out ; the curves in the state space representing the horizon lines are analogous to curves separating thermodynamic phases and there is even an analogue of a thermodynamic critical point .",
    "schtzhold and unruh showed that the regime of gravity - wave propagation in an effective schwarzschild - like metric corresponds to the shallow water limit @xmath193  @xcite .",
    "the interaction with the white - hole horizon necessarily tunes a wave out of this regime ( @xmath194 ) into the @xmath0 regime in which dispersion causes the effective - metric description to break down . in other words , for pure gravity waves",
    "the white horizon is not dispersive when @xmath193 whereas it is dispersive when @xmath0 . on the other hand , waves in the @xmath0 regime considered in this paper",

    "previous results on the shape of waves at a blocking line ( horizon ) can be developed further for gravity - capillary waves .",
    "the horizons for surface waves can be treated as examples of saddle - node lines , which also describe caustics in optics .",
    "it is well known that an airy function describes both the intensity of light close to an optical caustic of the fold type  @xcite and the water shape for the amplitude of gravity waves close to a blocking line  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown elsewhere that the airy function depends on a  stopping length \" @xmath195 ( roughly the width of the arch of the airy function ) which scales like @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the position of the white horizon , and @xmath198 is the  surface gravity \" at the horizon .",
    "an experimental measurement of the airy shape has been carried out by chawla and kirby  @xcite .",
    "if surface tension is taken into account , we have seen that there is a critical point at the intersection of two saddle - node lines ( white and blue horizons ) .",
    "we anticipate that the wave at the critical point will be described by a pearcey catastrophe integral  @xcite due to the superposition of two airy catastrophe integrals for the two saddle - node lines .",
