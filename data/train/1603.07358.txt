    "the problem of computing matrix exponentials arises in many theoretical and practical problems .",
    "numerous methods have been developed to efficiently compute @xmath7 or its product with a vector @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is an @xmath9 complex matrix and @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to the classical paper @xcite of moler and van loan for a survey of a general theory and numerical methods for matrix exponentials . for matrix exponential problems involving a large and sparse matrix @xmath3",
    ", it is usually the product of the exponential with a vector that is of interest .",
    "this arises , for example , in solving the initial value problem ( @xcite ) @xmath10 see @xcite for some other applications .",
    "a large number of matrix exponential problems concern a _ positive definite _ @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath11 is hermitian positive definite ) , which defines a stable dynamical system with a solution converging to a steady state . another important class of problems involve a skew - hermitian matrix @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath12 with @xmath13 being hermitian ) , for which has a norm - conserving solution .",
    "such systems can be used to model a variety of physical problems where certain quantities such as energy are conserved .",
    "for example , a spectral method for solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation modeling n electrons leads to with a skew - hermitian matrix ; see @xcite . while we will study a general non - hermitian @xmath3 , we are particularly interested in these two important classes of problems , where stronger theoretical results can be derived .",
    "the krylov subspace methods are a powerful class of iterative algorithms for solving many large scale linear algebra problems",
    ". initially introduced by gallopoulos and saad @xcite , they have also become a popular method for approximating @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fixed parameter typically representing a time step .",
    "for the ease of notation , we will assume throughout that @xmath16 .",
    "a comprehensive theory has been developed in the literature with error bounds demonstrating convergence of the krylov subspace methods and its relation to certain properties of the matrix .",
    "for example , earlier results in @xcite relate convergence of the krylov subspace methods to the norm of the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "more refined error bounds have later been derived , that provide sharper estimates of the errors by considering additional spectral information such as enclosing regions of the field of values of @xmath3 or positive definiteness of @xmath3 ; see @xcite and the references contained therein . for a real symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath3 , it has been shown in a recent work @xcite that the speed of convergence is also determined by the condition number of @xmath3 as in the conjugate gradient method . for positive definite matrices that are not necessarily hermitian ,",
    "stronger convergence bounds have also been obtained in @xcite in terms of the field of values .",
    "however , most of these bounds are derived by assuming the field of values lying in a certain pre - defined region , which are not easy to apply or interpret .",
    "there is an inherited theoretical difficulty in quantitatively characterizing the influence on the convergence by the field of values , a two dimensional object .",
    "this issue also arises in the theory of the krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems .    in this paper",
    ", we study the relation between the convergence of the krylov subspace methods and the field of values through its bounding rectangle @xmath18\\times[-c , c]$ ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of the hermitian part of @xmath3 ) and @xmath21 ( the largest eigenvalue in absolute value of the skew - hermitian part of @xmath3 ) . with this approach , new _",
    "a priori _ error bounds will be derived in terms of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "simplified bounds will be presented for non - hermitian positive definite matrices and skew - hermitian matrices , which relate the speed of convergence to the size and the shape of the rectangular region . in particular ,",
    "our bounds explain an interesting observed convergence behavior where the error may first stagnate for certain iterations before it starts to converge .",
    "numerical examples will be presented to demonstrate the behavior of the new error bounds .    in developing our _ a priori _ error bounds",
    ", we also derive a new _ a posteriori _ error bound that is shown to provide a sharp and computable estimate of the error . the main technique used in deriving new _",
    "a priori _ error bounds is the same as in the literature @xcite by constructing faber polynomial approximation of the exponential function in a region containing the field of values .",
    "the novelty in this work is to use the jacobi elliptic functions to construct a conformal mapping for the rectangular region that tightly encloses the fields of value and to show that this highly complicated mapping can be simplified to yield some simple final bounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we first present some preliminaries about the faber polynomial approximation and the jacobi elliptic functions . in section [ sec : aposteriori ] , we present a new _ a posteriori _ error bound , which relates the convergence to the decay properties of functions of banded matrices . to study this decay behavior ,",
    "we construct a conformal mapping in section [ sec : conformal_mapping ] and present our new _ a priori _ error bound in section [ sec : apriori_nonhermitian ] . in section [ sec : apriori_skewhermitian ] , we apply the same idea on skew - hermitian matrices and derive simpler _ a priori _ bounds .",
    "numerical examples are presented in section [ sec : numerical_examples ] and some concluding remarks in section [ sec : concluding_remarks ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss some related results in complex analysis that will be needed .",
    "faber polynomials extend the theory of power series to domains more general than a disk .",
    "it starts with the riemann mapping theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) that states that every connected domain in the extended complex plane whose boundary contains more than one point can be mapped conformally onto a disk with its center at the origin .",
    "let @xmath25 be the extended complex plane and @xmath26 be a bounded , closed continuum in the complex plane with boundary @xmath27 such that the complement of @xmath26 is simply connected in the extended plane and contains the point at @xmath28 .",
    "a continuum is a non - empty , compact and connected subset of @xmath29 .",
    "then there exists a function @xmath30 which maps the complement of @xmath26 conformally onto the exterior of a circle @xmath31 and satisfies the normalization conditions @xmath32 then , the function @xmath33 has a laurent expansion at infinity of the form @xmath34 moreover , given any integer @xmath35 , @xmath36^n$ ] has a laurent expansion of the form @xmath37^n = z^n+\\alpha_{n-1}^{(n)}z^{n-1}+\\cdots+\\alpha_0^{(n)}+\\frac{\\alpha_{-1}^{(n)}}{z}+\\cdots\\ ] ] at infinity @xcite .",
    "then , we call the following polynomial containing non - negative powers of @xmath38 in the expansion @xmath39 the faber polynomials generated by @xmath26 .    the faber polynomials can be used to approximate analytic functions on @xmath26 , essentially through the power series approximation of a transformed function on @xmath40 .",
