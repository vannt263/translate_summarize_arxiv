    "gasoline includes radiative and compton cooling for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the star formation algorithm is based on a jeans instability criteria ( katz 1992 ) , but simplified so that gas particles satisfying constant density and temperature thresholds in convergent flows spawn star particles at a rate proportional to the local dynamical time ( see stinson et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the star formation efficiency was set to @xmath70 based on simulations of the milky way that satisfied the kennicutt ( 1998 ) schmidt law .",

    "another key piece of analysis was finding haloes .",
    "we identified collapsed structures using the spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm .",
    "we used a time varying virial density contrast from the fitting formulae of mainini et  al .",
    "the halo catalogue includes all structures with more than 200 dm particles . for dmg simulations we estimated the halo masses by taking into account _ all _ particles inside the virial radius ( see macci et  al .",

    "a significant test of our simulations are halo mass functions . figure [ mf ] compares the cumulative mass function @xmath98 in our simulations with the sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) predictions for @xmath24 and @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ mf ] shows the haloes found in the dmo and dmg simulations for both 256 and 64@xmath73mpc boxes .",
    "the consistency between the dmo and dmg simulations is readily apparent , as is the continuity of the mass function over 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "we make a more direct comparison with observations in figure [ starhalo ] , which shows how the ratio @xmath100 depends on the halo mass in both 64 and 256@xmath73mpc boxes .",

    ", the number of stars formed in the haloes generally follows the halo occupation distribution trend .",
    "it is possible that too many stars form in haloes in the highest @xmath102 bin .",
    "this is likely due to overcooling that plagues hydrodynamic simulations and might be fixed by including agn effects in the simulations .",
    "most important to the current study , figure [ starhalo ] shows a significant reduction of @xmath100 from the simulations to those run with dde .",
    "such reduction is significant and one should not be misled by the apparent consistency within error bars : they are large because of the spread of @xmath100 through individual haloes , but the reduction of @xmath100 is not randomly distributed , exhibiting just a slight increasing trend from smaller to greater haloes .",
    "we shall return on this point below .",
    "let us however remind that star formation in hydrodynamical simulations strongly depends on numerical ( mainly mass ) resolution ( e.g. mayer et  al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore expect the result shown in figure [ starhalo ] to change if the same simulations are run at higher resolution ( not only because we would resolve lower mass haloes )",
    ". naively one could expect to see a higher stellar production and , therefore , a significant deviation of simulated curves from observed ones . the point of our comparison with real data is not to show that our resolution allows intrinsically correct results , but that , _ with resolution adopted in this specific work _ , hydro simulations produce a reasonable amount of stars .",
    "figure [ sfr ] shows the cosmic star formation history in the 256@xmath73mpc boxes for both the and dde simulations .",
    "the top panel shows the simulated star formation rate density ( sfr , @xmath103 ) normalized to the observed @xmath24 value from hopkins & beacon ( 2006 ) . due to the low resolution of the simulations , they underproduced stars by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "we renormalized these values to show that the shape of the star formation history is similar to observations .",
    "the observational results are shown with constant @xmath105 error bars that roughly approximate the 2-@xmath106 uncertainty of their results .",
    "besides the slight deficiency in star formation , there are two key differences between the simulations and observed cosmic sfh .",
    "the hopkins & beacon ( 2006 ) observations peak at @xmath107 while the simulations peak around @xmath108 .",
    "the onset of star formation is also later in the simulations than the observations .",
    "this discrepancy is again a result of low resolution in the 256@xmath73mpc boxes .",
    "christensen et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that stars do nt form in halos with less than 200 gas particles .",
    "such haloes have a mass of @xmath109 in our simulations",
    ". sufficient numbers of these haloes do not form in our simulations until @xmath110 to form stars .",
    "the sfh of the 64@xmath73mpc box more closely follows the observed sfh with a peak around @xmath111 and an early onset of star formation .",
    "the results in this case are also affected by significant sample variance due to the limited size of the simulated volume .",
    "the bottom frame of figure [ sfr ] shows the ratio between @xmath112 the dde and simulations , highlighting the reduced star formation found using the dde model .",
    "the decrease is @xmath113 and it is worth noting that it originates simply from a change of the de equation of state . the models , in fact , have exactly the same age at @xmath24 and identical cosmological parameters , apart from @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath8 discrepancy shows how different the evolutionary histories and concentration distributions are between the two cosmologies .",
    "the magnitude of the discrepancy is larger than anticipated and we will devote future work to determining the cause of such a significant difference .    before concluding this section",
    "let us however return on the issue concerning resolution .",
    "the comparison with real data just shows that our hydro simulations give a reasonable star production rate , as function of halo mass , and a reasonable distribution of such rate , as a function of redshift .",
    "this ensures us that the effect of baryonic matter ( mainly stars ) on the total matter power spectrum should be realistic .",
    "this will be true especially on the spatial scales ( @xmath88 ) that we will address in this work ( for @xmath114 ) , scales that are much larger than the typical sizes of galaxies .",
    "now that we have shown that our hydrodynamic model is reasonable on the large scales we wish to study , we turn our attention to how the density power spectra depend on the de model used .",
    "figure [ lw ] shows a comparison between dmo and dmg spectra at @xmath24 .",
    "both the dm and total power spectra of the collisional case show a substantial enhancement especially at scales @xmath115 .",
    "this scale corresponds to the most massive structure in our simulation and reflects the fact that gas has condensed and cooled inside those structures driving a contraction of the haloes themselves ( e.g. gnedin et  al .",
    "the gas shows a bias with respect to the other dmg spectra at large scales @xmath116 .",
    "this effect has been shown in previous work ( jing et  al .",
    "2006 , rudd et  al .",
    "2008 ) and is related to gas moving from large scales to small scales due to cooling .",
    "the cooling is most obvious at @xmath117 , where the gas spectra has more power than dmo , reflecting the presence of dense clumps of cold gas at small scales , in the center of dark matter halos .",
    "the differences between dmo and dmg can be better appreciated in figure [ big ] where the ratio between the different spectra is shown as a function of redshift .",
    "it is interesting to note that the large scale bias of the gas spectrum already shown in figure [ lw ] is strongly redshift dependent and starts to develop only after @xmath118 and is related to gas cooling and consumption within dark matter haloes .",
    "another interesting feature at @xmath24 is the higher power in the dm spectrum with respect to the total one in the dmg simulation at intermediate scales ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "this is due to a combination of two effects : the large bias in the gas spectrum ( which reduces the total one ) and the small contribution of the stellar component on these scales , that are larger than typical galactic scales . for @xmath117 the gap between the total and dm spectra vanishes thanks to the increased contribution of cold gas and stars . we will come back to discuss the effect of stars and resolution on dmg spectra in section [ ssec : res ]    a further interesting result is the comparison between dmo or dmg spectra and the halofit expressions ( smith et  al .",
    "2003 ) . only the 256@xmath73mpc box can be used for this comparison .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ halofit ] .",
    "the validity of halofit up to @xmath120@xmath57mpc@xmath5 is confirmed , although discrepancies @xmath121@xmath122 are found in some spectral ranges .",
    "a clear conclusion is that , when aiming at 1@xmath20 precision , the halofit expressions need to be significantly improved .      figure [ whynbody ] compares the power spectra of the large and small dmo boxes with the halofit expressions at @xmath24 .",
    "while the power spectrum from the 256@xmath73mpc box agrees with halofit across the entire range of its validity , the spectrum from the 64@xmath73mpc box exhibits a shortage of power in the spectral region where non - linearity begins to display its effects .",
    "this shortage of power is due to the lack of long wavelength components in the small box , and clearly shows that @xmath123@xmath124mpc boxes are effected by significant sample variance .",
    "thus , we can not draw quantitative conclusions above @xmath125@xmath126mpc@xmath5 from such small boxes . conversely hydrodynamical simulation results could be dependent on numerical resolution , and the higher resolution possible in small boxes make them a useful tool to address resolution issues .",
    "figure [ small ] shows the fractional difference between dmo and dmg simulations in the small box .",
    "the gas component shows a slightly different behaviour than it did in figure [ big ] . in the small box ,",
    "the bias at large scales is already present at @xmath127 and grows substantially to @xmath24 , propagating its effects at smaller and smaller scales .",
    "this is a consequence of the enhanced sf in the small box that , as mentioned in  [ mfandsf ] , peaks at @xmath128 .",
    "owing to the ( smaller ) discrepancies in the overall spectra , it seems natural to argue that a systematic power depletion in the gas spectrum occurs because of stars formation in small scale sites .",
    "this is confirmed by a comparison with rudd et  al .  (",
    "2008 ) spectra , shown in their figure 2 , right - hand panels . in their case ,",
    "the power depletion in the gas spectra is even stronger , so that the overall spectra are systematically above cdm .",
    "however , rudd et  al .  ( 2008 ) state in their paper that their simulations are characterized by an excess in star formation by a factor @xmath129 .",
    "because of the high star formation , they see the same depletion in their gas power spectra , only stronger .",
    "the enhanced star formation in the small box also has an effect on the ratio between total and dm spectrum in the dmg simulation . in the small box , the total spectrum is higher than the dm spectrum for @xmath117 thanks to the stellar component .",
    "the effect more important than resolution is the intrinsic lack of power in the small box .",
    "thus , the total spectrum is strongly reduced in the small box with respect to the large one .",
    "this difference is on the order of 50% at @xmath130 and even larger , up to 100% for @xmath131 ( see also levine & gnedin 2006 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results on the total , gas and dm spectra behaviour in the large box are closest to the results of jing et  al .",
    "2006 ( who used a box of 100 ) , who also found the dm spectrum to lie above the total one for intermediate values of @xmath7 .",
    "the two conclusions we draw from this comparison between the small and large box are : ( i ) @xmath132@xmath124mpc boxes are effected by significant sample variance , frequently yielding potentially misleading results , and hardly allowing quantitative conclusions above @xmath133@xmath126mpc@xmath5 ; ( ii ) in turn , boxes with a side @xmath134260@xmath73mpc yield results that will only require slight quantitative adjustments ( possibly at higher resolution ) for @xmath135@xmath136mpc@xmath5 .",
    "we are thus left with no reasons why we should not trust spectral comparisons between different models , shown in the forthcoming figures .",
    "if some ( minor ) bias is present , it should affect related spectra in a similar fashion .",
    "we now turn our attention from the effects of resolution and baryons on power spectra to the effects of using different cosmologies .",
    "figure [ dde ] shows the fractional spectral differences between and dde ( upper panel ) and and 1 ( lower panel ) .",
    "two main effects are apparent : ( i ) the curves are much smoother for dde than for 1 . in particular , in the top panel ,",
    "the discrepancy at @xmath24 almost vanishes , for the total spectrum .",
    "this is because is the @xmath28@xmath69 model of dde , so these findings are expected . in particular , the discrepancies up to @xmath137 at higher @xmath2 affirm the findings of francis et  al .",
    "the discrepancies between and 1 ( bottom panel ) are far more exaggerated and are typical of models lying @xmath138 s away from wmap5 data .",
    "this shows that spectral analysis that can detect 1@xmath20 differences will successfully discriminate among models within the 2-@xmath106 curves in figure [ ellypse ] .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath22cdm1 model re - affirms that dmo ",
    "dmg spectral discrepancies become most significant at @xmath1393@xmath140mpc@xmath5 .    in section 2",
    "we reviewed the technique presented in paper i , that we shall explicitly test here .",
    "we start from the assigned model @xmath27 , which is our dde model , and find the auxiliary models @xmath28@xmath38 for at @xmath141 , 1 and 2  .",
    "they must share the values of @xmath39 and  @xmath31 with @xmath27 .",
    "let us recall that the former request is easily fulfilled , as @xmath142 and , by multiplying both sides of this relation by @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) we have that @xmath143 , independent of the model .",
    "conversely , the evolution of @xmath31 depends on the state equation of de and its values at @xmath24 and @xmath144 can only be worked out once we know the _ constant _ de state parameters @xmath9 of the @xmath28@xmath38 models for @xmath141 , 0.5 , 1 , 2  .",
    "the final requirement , causing the dependence on @xmath2 of the constant @xmath10 s is that @xmath10 is tuned so that @xmath28@xmath38 and @xmath27 have equal distances between @xmath2 and the lsb .    in figures [ wr0 ] and [ wr0a ] we compare spectra at @xmath141 and 0.5 , 1 , 2  .",
    "notice the extreme expansion of the ordinate units in these plots . besides the gas case , the whole ordinate range is within @xmath145 , for @xmath146 .",
    "the basic result is that regularities persist when gas dynamics is important , although residual discrepancies ( of the order of a few permils ) are greater in dmg simulations .",
    "the largest discrepancy is found in the gas spectra , even if the gas spectrum distortion at @xmath24 , attaining @xmath147 , apparently does not imply a significant distortion in the global spectrum .",
    "altogether it is fair concluding that even the inclusion of hydrodynamics keeps the discrepancies between the auxiliary model and the true model in the permil range and this is one of of the major results of this work .",
    "matter density spectra @xmath0 provide a basic link between observational data and theoretical models of the nature of de .",
    "we envisage comparing the models with data from tomographic shear surveys .",
    "such surveys allow one to work out the angular power spectrum @xmath148 , for weak lensing convergence between the @xmath149th and @xmath150th tomographic beams covering the redshift intervals @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath148 is directly related to @xmath153 being @xmath154 w_i(z ) w_j(z){h_o \\over h(z)}~. \\label{spectra}\\ ] ] here @xmath155 is the hubble parameter at the redshift @xmath2 , @xmath156 is the comoving angular diameter distance between @xmath2 and @xmath157 , while @xmath158 @xmath159 being the comoving galaxy number distribution on redshift . using eq .",
    "( [ spectra ] ) , tomographic shear survey data , for @xmath160 , will yield matter fluctuation spectra for @xmath161 .",
    "the essential point , here , is that such spectra arise from any possible gravitational source .",
    "any link with assumptions on the mass / luminosity ratio is therefore broken .",
    "furthermore , the expected accuracy of lensing surveys will allow to recover @xmath0 with a precision @xmath121@xmath162 .    for gravitational lensing shear predictions ,",
    "at first order , there seems to be no need to take into account the baryon component .",
    "baryons are comprise a small fraction of the universal mass fraction compared to dm , and their distribution can be only slightly different from cdm . but",
    "what makes baryons extremely important is the precision that shear measurements will reach ( @xmath121@xmath162 ) in the near future .",
    "this presents a new challenge for hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "formerly , a slight inaccuracy in baryon physics was a second order problem compared with the high precision achieved in tracing the total matter distribution . while baryons are less massive than cdm , the way cdm reacts to the evolution of the baryon distribution makes baryons an essential ingredient .",
    "let us then outline a very crucial issue concerning the extrapolation of @xmath9 from tomographic cosmic shear data .",
    "this point , already made in paper i , is strengthened by this work , taking into account baryon physics .",
    "the point is that the conversion between the observed evolution of @xmath9 and the true one of the underlying model is not a straightforward operation .",
    "figure [ tw22 ] shows the redshift evolution of the state parameter of the @xmath27 model ( solid line ) compared with the values of the constant-@xmath10 in the different auxiliary models ( @xmath28 ) at different redshifts ( solid squares ) .",
    "the figure outlines that cosmic shear measures , fitted assuming constant @xmath10 in each @xmath2bin ( i.e. the solid squares ) would infer an evolution of @xmath10 with redshift ( the dotted line ) radically different from the _ true _ underlying model @xmath27 ( solid line ) .",
    "the mapping between the @xmath10 values best fitting data in the tomographic layer about @xmath2 and the real evolution of @xmath9 should be done with extreme care as shown in casarini ( 2010 ) .",
    "in this work , we employed large scale hydrodynamical simulations , including gas cooling , star formation and supernovae feedback .",
    "our simulations perform quite well when compared to observational results .",
    "they produce a sizable stellar component in collapsed dark matter haloes and star formation histories comparable with observations .",
    "we are aware that these results strongly depend on the adopted ( low ) resolution , nevertheless the similarity to observations makes us confident that the effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum in our simulation is sufficiently realistic .",
    "that said , further work is needed to better address the impact of the physics of star formation on the final results and , most important , to provide better tests of sample variance . in particular , this work makes clear that no really quantitative predictions , unaffected by sample variance , can be drawn from simulations , in @xmath163 boxes .",
    "matching observed accuracies of @xmath121@xmath164 will require boxes a few hundred mpcs on a side . in principle a box with @xmath165mpc , as the one we mostly used here , should be adequate to delve into haloes , providing spectra up to @xmath166mpc@xmath5 , with the required accuracy .",
    "however , the spectra obtained from our large box differed in a non negligible way from the ones obtained from a smaller box ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "although being fully compatible with the sample variance of the smaller box , this suggests further investigation will be required .",
    "these residual uncertainties do not prevent us , though , from testing the efficiency of a method introduced in paper i , that allows us to work out power spectra prediction for any de model based on models with a constant equation of state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we found up to @xmath168 , that the _ auxiliary _ @xmath28 models ( with constant @xmath10 ) yield spectra consistent with our _ assigned _",
    "@xmath27 model ( with a polynomial @xmath9 ) within a few permils .",
    "the test was performed for a single @xmath27 dde model .",
    "we plan to extend such a test to more dde models in forthcoming work .",
    "there is however no reason to expect that the point selected on the @xmath64@xmath65 plane owns peculiar properties .",
    "the residual discrepancies between @xmath27 and @xmath28 models exhibit a specific trend , already visible in paper i : discrepancies ( of a few permils ) are greater for smaller @xmath2 values . also dmg results follow the same rule , which is even even more pronounced for baryon spectra .",
    "gas spectra discrepancies often exceed the permils but are systematically compensated by other components .",
    "the success of our technique was not unexpected , but discrepancies at such a tiny level , also for @xmath17@xmath57mpc@xmath5 , exceeded our expectations .",
    "the requirement that two models have the same @xmath169 and @xmath170 introduces basic similarity : they will have similar baryon acoustic oscillations and typical fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "then , the requirement that @xmath10 yield the same conformal time @xmath171 elapsed since recombination for assigned and auxiliary models apparently sets an equal timing for the gradual onset of the non - linear evolution on analogous structures .",
    "however , while @xmath171 is a fair time coordinate for structures slightly detached from the cosmic background , it no longer plays such a role in cosmic islands , which have abandoned the cosmic expansion and evolve on their own , forgetting the continuing increase of the scale factor @xmath172 within these structures , space - time is substantially minkowskian , and time evolution is set by the ordinary time @xmath173    these are , however , two extreme situations .",
    "the scales which `` recently '' abandoned the overall expansion and entered a non - linear regime are in an intermediate position .",
    "our inspection mostly concerns such scales .",
    "accordingly , the success of an equal-@xmath171 requirement is anything but granted .",
    "here we use hydrodynamical simulations to study a larger @xmath7 domain ( compared to paper i ) , where the effects of baryons can not be neglected anymore . by introducing non - gravitational effects",
    "we expect dynamics to be regulated by the ordinary time @xmath174 , thus producing larger discrepancies at scales @xmath17@xmath34mpc@xmath5 .",
    "figure [ wr0 ] rejects this hypothesis by showing that the matter distribution is still ruled by the primeval clock .",
    "in particular , for @xmath17@xmath34mpc@xmath5 , the overall dmg spectral discrepancies , at @xmath24 , are perhaps even smaller than dmo .",
    "curiously enough , the opposite seems true at some greater @xmath2 s , suggesting that most discrepancies found are pure noise , rather than systematics . clearly for larger @xmath7 s ,",
    "when we delve into regions that virialized long ago , @xmath27 and @xmath28 models unavoidably differ",
    ". however , while we restrict ourselves to the scales that forthcoming weak lensing surveys will study , the paper i requirement still works unexpectedly well .",
    "one ought to beware , however , that the success of our approach does not imply that constant-@xmath10 and variable-@xmath10 models are indiscernible .",
    "what makes them observationally different is the measured dependence of @xmath10 on the redshift @xmath2 .",
    "an essential issue , however , is that _ the observed constant state parameter @xmath9 will not be the physical one of the de component_. although we expect data to fit , at any @xmath2 , the same density and hubble parameter values , the observed @xmath9 will be the state parameter that a constant-@xmath10 model must have , at such @xmath2 , to grant the same distance between there and the lsb . the relation between the observed @xmath10 and the intrinsic one , for the de component , should be put under control ; otherwise there is a severe risk that future data analysis lead to de state equation misinterpretation .",
    "a final point we wish to make is that halofit expressions , so useful for predicting spectra until now , have been tested and found compatible with their claimed accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , accuracy at ( @xmath175 ) no longer matches our needs .",
    "furthermore , among models that approach the present data , halofit expressions only need to handle .",
    "if one aims to improve halofit expressions , there is no longer any need to cover the wide array of models that once were relevant , but now are far from observation .",
    "amelioration , however , is needed in two separate directions : ( i ) the spectral range covered by predictions must reach @xmath176mpc@xmath5 , which requires that gas be considered ; rudd et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) had actually attempted an extension in this direction , but limited themselves to cosmologies .",
    "( ii ) de state parameters different from constant @xmath177 should be included .",
    "moreover , they should aim for a precision of @xmath121@xmath164 , which presents a severe challenge , even for a much more restricted model range .",
    "nevertheless when halofit expressions of the required precision will be available , even only for constant-@xmath10 models , thanks to the results of this work it will be straightforward to extend them to any @xmath9 law .",
    "giuseppe murante is thanked for fruitful discussions .",
    "the authors acknowledge j. wadsley for development of the gasoline code and thank him for its use in this work .",
    "numerical simulations and spectral analysis were performed on the pia and on panstarrs2 clusters of the max - planck - institut fr astronomie at the rechenzentrum in garching and at the cineca  bologna computer center , within the frame of the inaf  cineca agreement ( 20082010 ) . the support of asi ( italian space agency ) through the contract i/016/07/0 `` cofis '' is acknowledged ."
