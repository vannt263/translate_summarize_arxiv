    "@xcite .",
    "to understand the unusual electronic properties of graphene , it often suffices to discuss the charge susceptibility .",
    "the static polarizability at @xmath3 , e.g. , gives the thomas - fermi screening length , important for transport properties @xcite whereas the dynamical polarizability at zero - wave number can explain the phonon softening @xcite at the @xmath4-point .",
    "it is also used for the understanding of structural inhomogeneities in graphene , so - called ripples@xcite and the van der waals interaction between graphene layers@xcite .    for neutral graphene ,",
    "the polarizability at zero temperature was first calculated by gonzalez et al .",
    "@xcite , the effect of temperature was discussed by vafek @xcite and vertex corrections were considered in ref .",

    "recently , the polarizability was discuss in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite and gapped graphene @xcite .",
    "all these results originate from the dirac cone approximation in which the energy dispersion of the hexagonal lattice is linearized around one of the two dirac points where the valence and conduction band touch . but corrections to this approximation have to be included to discuss e.g. the recently measured absorption of suspended graphene in the visible - optics regime@xcite , which is related to polarizability via the continuity equation .",

    "our interest is motivated by the recent findings of an additional plasmon mode that emerges at around @xmath6ev with a linear dispersion @xcite which was observed on freestanding graphene by electron energy loss spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "apart from the high - energy corrections stemming from interband transitions , we also look at the intraband contribution at low energies and find that even there deviations from the dirac cone approximation occur . by this , we complement a recent work , where the plasmon dispersion is discussed by also considering the full brillouin zone @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
