    "hadron spectroscopy plays a crucial role in validating quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the quark substructure of matter . in recent years",
    "this field of particle physics has received a renewed interest , thanks to the discovery of many new states at the @xmath3 factories .",
    "some of these states , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are by now well established and appear to be ordinary charm mesons .",
    "others , such as @xmath0(3872 ) and @xmath6(3940 ) , could be new excited charmonium ( @xmath7 ) states or new forms of matter , but require more measurements with better statistical precision for a definitive identification .",
    "the  experiment @xcite is an @xmath8 collider experiment taking data at or just below the @xmath9 resonance at the pep - ii asymmetric @xmath3 factory .",
    "it was designed to study cp violation in the @xmath3 system , however it has proved to have a significantly broader physics reach , especially in the spectroscopy sector .",
    "we report here recent results on new charmonium - like states studied using the data sample .",
    "the @xmath0(3872 ) state was first observed in the decay @xmath10 @xcite by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "later it was confirmed by the cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite and @xcite collaborations .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath11 invariant mass in the decay @xmath12 suggests that the decay may proceed through an intermediate @xmath13 resonance .",
    "if so , one can expect to find its charged isospin partner @xmath14 .",
    "we have searched for this state in the decays @xmath15 and @xmath16 . however , no evidence for a charged @xmath17 has been found @xcite and we set the following upper limits at 90% confidence level ( cl ) : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . a search for @xmath17 in the process @xmath20 via the decay to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes initial state radiation ( isr ) , has yielded a null result @xcite . this strongly disfavors a @xmath23 assignment to @xmath0 .",
    "coupled with the fact that @xmath17 has a mass close to the @xmath24 threshold and has a very narrow width , this seems to tell us that x(3872 ) is not a simple charmonium state .",
    "alternative proposals have been made to explain this state ; for example , it could be a weakly bound @xmath25 molecule - like state @xcite     invariant mass distribution in the signal region for ( a ) @xmath26 and ( b ) @xmath27.,title=\"fig : \" ]   invariant mass distribution in the signal region for ( a ) @xmath26 and ( b ) @xmath27.,title=\"fig : \" ]    or a diquark - antidiquark state @xcite . to investigate these models ,",
    "has updated its earlier study with increased statistics .    using 232 million @xmath28 pairs recorded by",
    ", @xmath17 candidates are reconstructed in the decays @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath21 invariant mass distributions for these two @xmath3 decay modes @xcite . for the charged @xmath3 mode",
    ", we obtain @xmath31 while for the @xmath32 mode only @xmath33 signal events .",
    "these yields are translated to the respective branching fractions by taking efficiency corrections into account : @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where uncertainties are statistical and systematic , respectively . from these",
    "we derive a ratio of the branching fractions , @xmath36 .",
    "we also measure the mass difference of the @xmath17 state from the charged and neutral @xmath3 decay modes , @xmath37 , to be @xmath38 .",
    "the diquark - antidiquark model predicts @xmath39 and @xmath37 to be @xmath40",
    ". the expected ratio of branching fractions is consistent with our measurement , @xmath41 at 90% cl and the observed @xmath37 is both consistent with zero and the model prediction within two standard deviations ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this result seems to slightly disfavor the molecule model that predicts @xmath43 to be at most 10% .",
    "however , we need more data to convincingly discriminate between these models .",
    "a novel recoil technique is devised to measure various charmonium states @xmath44 in inclusive @xmath3 decays to the two - body final state @xmath45 .",
    "two body decays are identified by their characteristic monochromatic line without any necessity of reconstructing the decay products of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , this method allows us to determine the absolute branching fractions ( or set upper limits ) for the production of any known or unknown charmonium resonances .",
    "the analysis is performed using 210 @xmath46 of data where a charged @xmath3 meson is fully reconstructed , so that the momentum of the recoiling @xmath3 candidate can be calculated from the measured @xmath3 and the beam parameters .",
    "meson rest frame.,title=\"fig : \" ]   meson rest frame.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the kaon energy ( @xmath47 ) in the second @xmath3 rest frame is related to the mass ( @xmath48 ) of the system recoiling against it by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the charged @xmath3 meson mass .",
    "therefore , the signature of any charmonium states will be visible as a peak in the kaon momentum ( or energy ) spectrum as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 signals are clearly seen in the figure .",
    "we also have 3.2@xmath42 , 1.8@xmath42 and 1.4@xmath42 indications for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "no evidence for @xmath17 is found and we derive @xmath57 , which , in conjunction with the world - average value of the branching fraction product , allows us to set the lower limit @xmath58 4.2% at 90% cl .",
    "in , exclusive @xmath3 decays are not the only source of charmonium states . we have also studied double charmonium production in the process @xmath59 using 124 @xmath46 of data @xcite .",
    "only @xmath60 states with even c - parity are expected in this reaction , although if there is a contribution from @xmath61 , odd c - parity states could also be produced . in this study , we first reconstruct a @xmath51 candidate via its leptonic decay mode and then calculate the mass of the system recoiling against it ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "three even c - parity charmonium states , @xmath52 , @xmath62 and @xmath55 , are observed ,    . ]    while there is no evidence for any odd c - parity states such as @xmath51 .",
    "the distribution is fit to obtain the yield for each state , from which the production cross section is calculated . due to the requirement of at least five charged tracks in the event for background suppression , we report the product of the branching fraction to states with more than two tracks and the production cross section .",
    "the results are @xmath63 fb , @xmath64 fb and @xmath65 fb for @xmath52 , @xmath62 and @xmath55 , respectively . these values are an order of magnitude higher than those predicted by non - relativistic qcd @xcite .",
    "however , recent works incorporating charm quark dynamics @xcite seem to narrow down the discrepancy .",
    "isr events produced in the @xmath9 energy region at the @xmath3 factories act as a probe of interesting physics occurring at a lower center - of - mass energy .",
    "motivated by this ,  has investigated the @xmath66 process across the charmonium mass range , using a data sample     invariant mass spectrum in the range 3.8@xmath675.0 @xmath68 and ( inset ) over a wider range that includes the @xmath54 state . ]    of 233 @xmath46 integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "these events are characterized by two pions , two leptons ( electron or muon ) making a @xmath51 candidate and a very small recoil mass against the @xmath21 system .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath21 invariant mass spectrum for the selected candidates .",
    "an enhancement of events near 4.26 @xmath68 is clearly observed in addition to the expected @xmath54 peak .",
    "no other structures are evident in the spectrum including the @xmath17 . using a maximum likelihood fit",
    ", we obtain a signal yield of @xmath69 with a statistical significance of 8@xmath42 ( the signal is referred to as @xmath70 ) .",
    "the mass and width of the particle are found to be @xmath71 and @xmath72 mev , respectively .",
    "we also calculate a value of @xmath73 ev .",
    "although all these results are from a single resonance fit , we can not exclude or establish a multi - resonance hypothesis at the current level of statistics .",
    "more data are needed to reveal its exact nature .",
    "the last few years have been very exciting for hadron spectroscopy studies at the @xmath3 factories .",
    "specifically ,  is pioneering several sensitive searches for new charmonium states , some of which are summarized in this paper , including the first measurement of the @xmath17 state in neutral and charged @xmath3 decays and the observation of a new broad resonance @xmath70 .",
