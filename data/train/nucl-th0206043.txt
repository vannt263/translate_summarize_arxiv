    "the study of the in - medium properties of hadrons has attracted continuous attention and is one of the most interesting topics of nuclear physics .",
    "so far , several kinds of hadron - nucleus bound systems have been investigated such as pionic atoms , kaonic atoms , and @xmath6 atoms @xcite .",
    "the structure of these systems is described by means of a complex optical potential , which reproduces well the experimental data obtained by the x - ray spectroscopic methods @xcite .",
    "the search of the deeply bound pionic atoms has been performed from the end of 80 s @xcite , and the use of the recoilless ( d,@xmath4he ) reaction @xcite led to the successful discovery of the deeply bound states , which enable us to deduce in - medium pion properties @xcite .",
    "now extensions of the method to other meson - nucleus bound states are being widely considered both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath0 mesic nucleus as one of the doorways to investigate the in - medium properties of the @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the special features of the @xmath0 mesic nucleus are the following ; ( 1 ) the @xmath0-@xmath7 system dominantly couples to @xmath1 at the threshold region @xcite . ( 2 ) the isoscalar particle @xmath0 filters out contaminations of the isospin 3/2 excitations in the nuclear medium . ( 3 ) due to the @xmath8-wave nature of the @xmath9 coupling there is no threshold suppression like the @xmath10-wave coupling .",
    "the strong coupling of the @xmath3 to @xmath11 makes the use of this channel particularly suited to investigate this resonance in a cleaner way than the use of @xmath12 for the study of other resonances like the @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the in - medium properties of hadron are believed to be related to partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the contemporary point of view ( see , e.g.@xcite ) , in which a reduction of the order parameter of the chiral phase transition in hot and/or dense matter takes place and causes modifications of the hadron properties .",
    "the @xmath3 , which is the lowest lying parity partner of the nucleon , has been investigated from the point of view of chiral symmetry @xcite , where the @xmath7 and @xmath3 form a multiplet of the chiral group . in refs.@xcite",
    "a reduction of the mass difference of the @xmath7 and @xmath3 in the nuclear medium is found in the chiral doublet model , while a reduction of the @xmath3 mass is also found as the quark condensate decreases in the qcd sum rule @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that the @xmath3 mass in free space lies only fifty mev above the @xmath15 threshold , the medium modification of the @xmath3 mass will strongly affect the in - medium potential of the @xmath0 meson through the strong @xmath16 coupling described above .    as one of the standard theoretical tools to obtain the structure of the bound states , we solve the klein - gordon equation with the meson - nucleus interaction , which is expressed in terms of an optical potential and is evaluated using the chiral doublet model developed in refs.@xcite , which embodies the reduction of the @xmath3 mass associated with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry , assuming the @xmath3 dominance for the @xmath11 coupling described above .",
    "the calculation is done in nuclear matter with the mean - field approximation , and the local density approximation is used to apply it to the finite nuclei . for the observation of the these bound states , we also consider the missing mass spectroscopy by the ( d,@xmath4he ) reaction which was proven to be a powerful tool experimentally .",
    "to evaluate the expected spectra theoretically , we adopt the green function method for the unstable bound states @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we describe the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential which is obtained in our framework with the chiral doublet model and the @xmath3 dominance . in section 3",
    "we show the numerical results for the @xmath0 meson bound states in the nucleus and the ( d,@xmath4he ) spectra .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the summary and conclusion .",
    "the @xmath0-mesic nuclei were studied by haider and liu @xcite and by chiang , oset and liu @xcite systematically . there ,",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential was expected to be attractive from the data of the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length and the existence of the bound states was predicted theoretically . as the formation reaction , the use of the ( @xmath17 ) reaction was proposed and the attempt to find the bound states in the reaction led to a negative result @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath17 ) experiment @xcite was designed to be sensitive to the expected narrow states , but was probably not sensitive enough to see much broader structures . before presenting the detail of our model calculation ,",
    "let us show the possibility to have a repulsive @xmath0 optical potential in the nucleus due to the significant reduction of the mass difference of @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "considering the self - energy of the @xmath0 meson at rest in nuclear matter in the @xmath3 dominance model , in analogy with the @xmath18-hole model for the @xmath19-nucleus system , we obtain the @xmath0 optical potential in the nuclear medium in the heavy baryon limit @xcite as ; @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the @xmath0 energy , and @xmath22 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0 and the nucleus and is very close to the @xmath0 mass , @xmath23 , for heavy nuclei .",
    "@xmath24 is the density distribution for nucleons in the finite nucleus , for which we assume here a fermi distribution .",
    "the `` effective mass '' of @xmath7 and @xmath3 in medium , denoted as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are defined through their propagators so that @xmath27 .",
    "the in - medium @xmath3 width @xmath28 includes the many - body decay channels .",
    "the @xmath9 vertex @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 to reproduce the partial width @xmath32 mev @xcite at tree level .    supposing no medium modifications for the masses of @xmath7 and @xmath3 as well as small binding energy for the @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 , we obtain an attractive potential independent of density since we always have @xmath34 in the nucleus .",
    "the shape of this potential is essentially the same as the woods - saxon type potential for a finite nucleus assuming the local density approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "if a sufficient reduction of the mass difference of @xmath7 and @xmath3 stems from the medium effects , there exists a critical density @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and then at densities above @xmath35 the @xmath0 optical potential turns to be repulsive . if @xmath35 is lower than the nuclear saturation density @xmath37 , the optical potential for the @xmath0 is attractive around the surface of the nucleus and repulsive in the interior",
    ". therefore the bound states of the @xmath0 in nuclei , if they exist , will be localized at the surface and the level structure of the @xmath0 bound states will be quite different from that in the case of the woods - saxon type potential .    to make the argument more quantitative",
    ", we estimate the in - medium @xmath7 and @xmath3 masses and the @xmath3 width in the chiral doublet model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which embodies the reduction of the mass difference of @xmath7 and @xmath3 associated with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the chiral doublet model is an extension of the @xmath38 linear sigma model for the nucleon incorporating the @xmath3 . in the model @xmath7 and @xmath3",
    "are expressed as superpositions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 which are eigenvectors under the chiral transformation .",
    "there are two types of the linear sigma model choosing either the assignment of the same sign of the axial charge to @xmath39 and @xmath40 or the opposite sign to each other . the model with the later construction was first investigated by detar and kunihiro @xcite , and was named the `` mirror assignment '' later on to distinguish it from the first assignment ( `` naive assignment '' ) @xcite .",
    "here we shall discuss only the chiral doublet model with the mirror assignment .",
    "we have already checked that the naive assignment produces a qualitatively similar optical potential of the @xmath0 to that with the mirror assignment .",
    "the quantitative studies with the naive assignment will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the lagrangian of the chiral doublet model with the mirror assignment is given by @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\    & & - m_0 ( \\bar n_1 \\gamma_5 n_2 - \\bar n_2 \\gamma_5 n_1 ) \\",
    ",    \\label{mirmodel }    \\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are eigenvectors under the @xmath38 chiral transformation and have opposite axial charge to each other . the physical @xmath7 and @xmath3",
    "are expressed as a superposition of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 . in this basis , the @xmath7 and @xmath3 masses and the @xmath45 vertex are given as functions of the sigma condensate as in the standard liner sigma model : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the sigma condensate in nuclear matter .",
    "it is worth noting that the mass splitting between @xmath7 and @xmath3 is generated by the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry with a linear form of the sigma condensate .",
    "the parameters in the lagrangian have been chosen so that the observables in vacuum , @xmath48 mev , @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 mev are reproduced with @xmath51 mev , and they are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 mev@xcite .    in the linear @xmath55 model ,",
    "the nuclear medium effects come from the nucleon loops which modify the self - energies of @xmath7 and @xmath3 and the vertex of @xmath45 @xcite . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "such contributions can be introduced by making the replacement of the vacuum condensate of the sigma meson to the in - medium condensate which depends on the density @xmath56 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 should be determined elsewhere . here",
    "we take a linear parameterization as @xmath59 with @xmath60=@xmath61-@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 parameter represents the strength of the chiral restoration at the nuclear saturation density @xmath37 . finally , with this replacement ,",
    "the density dependence of the in - medium mass difference of @xmath7 and @xmath3 is obtained as @xmath63 this implies that for @xmath64 the real part of the in - medium @xmath0 self - energy with @xmath65 in eq.([poteta ] ) changes its sign at smaller densities than the saturation density @xmath66 .",
    "now let us consider the @xmath3 width in the medium .",
    "in free space there are three strong decay modes of @xmath3 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the first two are dominant modes and give almost the same decay rate . here the medium effects on the decay widths of these modes are taken into account by considering the pauli blocking effect on the decaying nucleon , and by changing the @xmath7 and @xmath3 masses and the @xmath45 coupling in medium through eqs .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and ( [ coup ] ) , according to the chiral doublet model as discussed above .",
    "the partial decay widths of @xmath3 to certain decay channels can be obtained by evaluating the self - energy of @xmath3 associated with the decay channel and by taking its imaginary part as @xmath68 . the partial decay width for @xmath69",
    "is calculated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the energy and the momentum of the final nucleon on the mass shell in the @xmath3 rest frame , respectively .",
    "the momentum @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 with the kllen function @xmath74 .",
    "the pauli blocking effect for @xmath69 mode is negligible due to the large decaying momentum @xmath75 mev in vacuum .",
    "the decay mode @xmath76 , however , does not contribute in the medium because of no available phase space due to the pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "the decay branching rate of the @xmath77 channel is known to be only @xmath78 percent in vacuum @xcite . here in the present calculation",
    ", we do not include this decay mode since its contribution is estimated to be only a few percent of the total decay rate in our model . in spite of no direct @xmath79 vertex in our model , this channel can be evaluated by considering the process @xmath80 using the linear sigma model for @xmath55 and @xmath19 .",
    "other medium effects on the decay of @xmath3 are the many - body decays , such as @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath3 many - body absorption , involving two - nucleon @xmath0 absorption mechanisms , is evaluated by inserting particle - hole excitations to the @xmath19 ( @xmath0 ) propagator in the @xmath12 ( @xmath11 ) self - energy of @xmath3 .",
    "the width from @xmath83 channel was already calculated in ref.@xcite and was found several mev at @xmath84 .",
    "here we neglect the contribution of this channel . the other @xmath3 absorption , @xmath85 ,",
    "is comparably larger than @xmath83 because of its phase space @xcite .",
    "we estimated the @xmath85 process within our model following the formulation of ref.@xcite : @xmath86 ^ 2 }    \\phi(p_1,p_2 ) \\ , \\label{nnpidecay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) are pion momenta ( energies ) , @xmath91 is the phase space variable defined in @xcite and @xmath92 with the effective coupling of @xmath93 through @xmath55 meson in this model , which is @xmath94 . this contribution is estimated to be typically fifteen mev at the saturation density , although it depends on the @xmath0 energy and @xmath60 parameter .",
    "we include this channel in the present calculation .",
    "in the previous section , we discuss the @xmath0 optical potential in nuclear matter using the @xmath3 dominance model and the chiral doublet model .",
    "the final expression of the @xmath0 optical potential in the nuclear medium is obtained by substituting the mass gap between @xmath7 and @xmath2 obtained in eq.([massdiff ] ) and the in - medium @xmath3 width described in eqs.([nstarwid ] ) and ( [ nnpidecay ] ) to eq.([poteta ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we show some numerical results for the @xmath0 meson in the nucleus from the optical potential derived above .      for finite nuclei",
    "we assume the local density approximation and the fermi distribution of nucleons in the nucleus with the radial parameter @xmath95 [ fm ] and the diffuseness parameter @xmath96 [ fm ] . in fig.[potentialfig ] , we show the @xmath0-nucleus potential for the @xmath97xe case , as an example . in other nuclei , the potential shape is essentially the same as the plotted one , but the radius of the repulsive core depends on the mass number @xmath98 . as can be seen in the figure , for the @xmath99 cases the real potential turns out to be repulsive at the inner part of the nucleus , associated with the reduction of the mass difference of @xmath7 and @xmath3 in the nucleus and an attractive `` pocket '' appears on the surface .",
    "this pocket - shape potential is new and so interesting that the existence of the repulsive core is consistent with the experiment @xcite , where the production of the @xmath0 meson on various nuclei is surface dominated due to the strong final state interaction .",
    "another interesting feature of the potential is its strong energy dependence . by changing the energy of the @xmath0 from @xmath100 to @xmath101 [ mev ] ,",
    "we find again the familiar attractive potential shape even with @xmath102 as shown in the figure .",
    "we also find that the imaginary part of the potential has a strong dependence both on the @xmath60 parameter and the @xmath0 energy .",
    "= 8.5 cm      in order to calculate the eigenenergies and wavefunctions of the @xmath0 bound states , we solve numerically the klein - gordon equation with the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential obtained here , and make an iteration to obtain the self - consistent energy eigenvalues for the strongly energy dependent optical potential .",
    "we follow the method of kwon and tabakin to solve it in momentum space @xcite .",
    "we increase the number of the mesh points in the momentum space which is here about 10 times larger than ref.@xcite .",
    "the number of mesh points was limited ( @xmath103 40 points ) and the parameters for the mesh points distribution were adjusted for the shallow mesic atoms @xcite .",
    "we check the stability of the obtained results carefully .",
    "we show the calculated binding energies and level widths in table [ eigenenergies ] for 1s and 2p states in several nuclei over the periodic table . for the @xmath104 case , in which no medium modifications are included in the @xmath7 and @xmath2 properties ,",
    "since the potential is proportional to the nuclear density distribution as we have seen in fig.[potentialfig ] , the level structure of the bound states is similar to that obtained in ref.@xcite . for @xmath105 cases ,",
    "the formation of @xmath0 bound states is quite difficult because of both the repulsive nature of the potential inside the nucleus and the huge imaginary part of the potential .    in order to see the @xmath60 parameter dependence of the bound states in @xmath106",
    ", we consider @xmath97xe as an example and calculate the bound states for @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 cases .",
    "the results are also compiled in the table [ eigenenergies ] .",
    "we should mention here that , due to the small attraction , in the pocket like case we do not find bound states .",

    "we consider the recoilless ( d,@xmath4he ) reaction , in which a proton is picked up from the target nucleus and the @xmath0 meson is left with a small momentum .",
    "the recoilless ( d,@xmath4he ) reaction is expected to be one of the most powerful experimental tools for formation of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus @xcite .",
    "the spectra of this reaction are investigated in detail in ref.@xcite . there",
    "they estimate the experimental elementary cross section of @xmath112he@xmath113 reaction to be 150 ( nb / sr ) in this kinematics based on the data taken at saturne @xcite , and use the green function method @xcite , in which the @xmath0-meson green function provides information of the structure of unstable bound states . applying the same approach , we evaluate the expected spectra of the ( d,@xmath4he ) reaction by assuming our optical potential for the @xmath0 in the nucleus . here",
    "we calculate the spectra of the @xmath114c(d,@xmath4he ) reaction for the @xmath0 production in the final state .",
    "the @xmath114c is shown to be a suitable target to populate the [ @xmath115 configuration largely @xcite .",
    "we assume the single particle nature for the protons in the target @xmath114c and consider @xmath116 and @xmath117 states .",
    "and we take into account sufficient number of partial waves @xmath118 of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that only @xmath119 partial waves are relevant in this energy region and we check numerically that contributions from higher partial waves are negligible .",
    "the obtained spectra are shown in fig.[fig : spec ] as functions of the excited energy which are defined as , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the @xmath0 binding energy and @xmath122 the proton separation energy .",
    "the @xmath0 production threshold energy @xmath123 is indicated in the figure by the vertical line .",
    "the calculated spectra are shown in fig.[fig : spec ] for three different sets of the parameter @xmath60 in the optical potential and the diffuseness parameter @xmath124 of the nuclear density distribution .",
    "in fig.[fig : spec](a ) , we show the result with @xmath125 and @xmath96 [ fm ] which corresponds to the spectrum with the potential which does not include any medium modifications of @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "the results with the medium corrections are shown in fig.[fig : spec](b ) for the @xmath126 case , where the @xmath0 optical potential has the repulsive core in the center of nucleus .",
    "it is seen in the fig.[fig : spec](a ) and ( b ) that , due to the repulsive nature of the @xmath0 potential with @xmath126 , the whole spectrum is shifted to the higher energy region and the @xmath8-wave @xmath0 contribution around @xmath127 0 [ mev ] is suppressed in fig.[fig : spec](b ) , which corresponds to the disappearance of the @xmath0-bound state for @xmath126 .",
    "the difference of these spectra is expected to be observed in the high resolution experiments .",
    "we also calculate the spectrum for the @xmath126 case with the diffuseness @xmath128 [ fm ] , to simulate the halo - like structure of unstable nuclei . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential has a wider attractive region than that with @xmath96 [ fm ] because of the existence of the longer tail at low nuclear densities .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : spec](c ) , where we can see that the whole spectrum is shifted to smaller energy regions compared to fig.[fig : spec](b ) indicating the attractive nature of the potential .",
    "= 8.5 cm      here we make some remarks on the  pocket - like \" potential .",
    "first of all , we would like to consider the interesting possibility to have @xmath0 bound states in @xmath5-unstable nuclei with a halo structure @xcite .",
    "so far , we have considered stable nuclei with the small diffuseness parameters ( @xmath96 [ fm ] ) , in which the density suddenly changes at the surface . as we have seen in fig.[potentialfig ] , the optical potential with a finite @xmath60 value is attractive only in the low density region at the nuclear surface .",
    "thus , halo nuclei have a larger attractive region than the stable nuclei and we expect to find more @xmath0 bound states , which will be like coexistence states of the halo - like @xmath0 mesic bound states with halo nucleons .",
    "we simulate the behavior of the @xmath0 bound states for nuclei with halo structure by changing the diffuseness parameters artificially for @xmath97xe case",
    ". however , in spite of our systematic search of the @xmath0 bound states for diffuseness parameters , @xmath129 and @xmath130 [ fm ] , no bound states in the pocket - like potential are found for the @xmath131 and @xmath132 cases .",
    "second , we have another quite interesting feature of the @xmath0-nucleus bound states because of its strong energy dependence . in the iterative calculation to get the self - consistent eigenenergies for the energy dependent potential , we have possibilities to find several solutions for certain set of the quantum numbers @xmath133 . actually , we have found the three 1s - like states for the @xmath0-@xmath134y system for the @xmath102 case by omitting the imaginary part of the optical potential .",
    "the wavefunctions of all three states do not have any node and they are shown to be ; ( 1 ) the bound 1s state with @xmath135 [ mev ] in the woods - saxon type potential , ( 2 ) the bound 1s state with @xmath136 [ mev ] in the attractive potential which is deeper at the surface than in the nuclear center , ( 3 ) the bound 1s state with @xmath137 [ mev ] in the surface - attractive and central - repulsive potential .",
    "third , we would like to make a general comment on the level structure of the bound states in the pocket - like potential . to make the argument clear , we consider only the real part of the pocket - like potential .",
    "let us consider the radial part of the schrdinger equation with an attractive pocket potential at a certain radius @xmath138 and a width @xmath124 .",
    "as we can see in any text book of quantum mechanics , this equation is exactly the same as the one dimensional schrdinger equation with the same potential pocket except for the centrifugal potential and the boundary condition for the wavefunction at the origin @xmath139 .",
    "since the one dimensional schrdinger equation has translational invariance with this potential , the eigenenergies do not depend on the position of the attractive pocket .",
    "this is also the case for the radial equation for heavy nuclei in which the attractive potential exists far from the nuclear center , where the wavefunction boundary condition is automatically satisfied and do not affect the eigenenergies .",
    "thus , the level structure would be expected to resemble each other for all heavy nuclei , which is quite different from the case of the woods - saxon type potential , where the binding energies become larger in heavier nuclei .",
    "another interesting feature of the level structure is that , since the pocket potential in heavy nuclei is far from the center of the system and then the centrifugal repulsive potential could be weak at the position of the pocket , then the different angular momentum states would approximately degenerate in heavy nuclei .",
    "all these features of the level structure are very interesting and really characteristic for the surface - attractive @xmath0-nucleus optical potential .",
    "very recently an investigation of the @xmath0 meson properties in the nuclear medium within a chiral unitary approach has been reported @xcite .",
    "there , they also found a strong energy dependent optical potential of the @xmath0 .",
    "it would be interesting to compare their consequences with ours since their theoretical framework is quite different from our model and there the @xmath2 is introduced as a resonance generated dynamically from meson - baryon scatterings .",
    "we investigate the consequences of the medium effects to @xmath1 @xmath140 through the eta - mesic nuclei assuming the @xmath2 dominance in the @xmath0-@xmath7 system .",
    "the chiral doublet model is used to estimate the medium modification of the @xmath7 and @xmath2 properties .",
    "this model embodies chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking within the baryonic level ( @xmath7 and @xmath2 ) and shows the reduction of the mass difference of @xmath7 and @xmath2 with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "we find that sufficient reduction of the mass difference due to chiral restoration makes the @xmath0 optical potential in nuclei repulsive at certain densities , while in the low density approximation the optical potential is estimated to be attractive .",
    "this leads us the possibility of a new type of potential of the @xmath0 in nucleus that is attractive at the surface and has a repulsive core at the center of the nucleus .",
    "we discuss general features of this `` pocket '' potential that the level structure is quite different from that with the potential simply obtained from the @xmath141 approximation with @xmath142 the scattering amplitude of the @xmath0-@xmath7 system .",
    "we calculate the in - medium optical potential of the @xmath0 meson with a mean - field approximation and use the local density approximation to apply it to finite nuclei .",
    "we also find that the potential obtained here has a strong energy dependence , which leads us to the self - consistent formulation in the calculation of the @xmath0 bound states in the nucleus .",
    "unfortunately it is hard to form @xmath0 bound states in the nuclei with the expected strength of the chiral restoration in nucleus ( @xmath143 ) , due to the repulsive nature of the potential inside the nucleus and its large imaginary potential .",
    "we find that there is no bound state for the case of @xmath144 even in the halo - like nuclei , which are expected to have moderate density distributions and to have a wider attractive potential pocket at the surface .",
    "we evaluate the spectra of the recoilless ( d,@xmath145he ) reaction with a @xmath114c target using our optical potential for the @xmath125 and @xmath132 cases .",
    "the shapes of these spectra are apparently different and the repulsive nature in the @xmath126 case is seen .",
    "the results with the large diffuseness parameter for the nuclear density distribution also show the sensitivity of the spectrum to the existence of the halo structure .",
    "we find that the existence of the halo also changes the spectrum shape , and thus a comprehensive study of @xmath0 bound states in unstable nuclei also would be interesting to investigate the medium effects of the @xmath3 .",
    "we believe that the present results are very important to investigate the chiral nature of @xmath7 and @xmath3 through @xmath0 bound states .",

    "<S> the structure of @xmath0-nucleus bound systems ( @xmath0 mesic nuclei ) is investigated as one of the tools to study in - medium properties of the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) resonance by using the chiral doublet model to incorporate the medium effects of the @xmath2 resonance in a chiral symmetric way . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the shape and the depth of the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential are strongly affected by the in - medium properties of the @xmath2 and the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> especially , as a general feature of the potential , the existence of a repulsive core of the @xmath0-nucleus potential at the nuclear center with an attractive part at the nuclear surface is concluded . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the level structure of bound states in this central - repulsive and surface - attractive optical potential and find that the level structure is sensitive to the in - medium properties of the @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the ( d,@xmath4he ) spectra are also evaluated for the formation of these bound states to investigate the experimental feasibility . </S>",
    "<S> we also make comments on the possible existence of halo - like @xmath0 states in @xmath5-unstable halo nuclei . </S>"
