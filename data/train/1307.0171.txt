    "recent years have witnessed the growing interest in the synchronization of networked systems because it is a ubiquitous phenomena in nature and because of its potential applications on secure communication , distributed generation of the grid , clock synchronization , formation control of multiple robots , and so on .",
    "the state synchronization problem might be rooted in the work of wu and chua @xcite and recently has been rejuvenated in linear systems with attentions on the accessibility of partial states or switching graph @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "different from the state synchronization that happens between identical systems , the output synchronization can arise between non - identical systems and thereby is more realistic .",
    "output synchronization for nonlinear input - output passive systems has been studied in @xcite , where under the passive - based design , the output synchronization can be achieved for many cases including balanced graph , nonlinear coupling function and communication delay . in @xcite ,",
    "the velocity synchronization problem for second - order integrators has been investigated .",
    "the above two studies only take aim at driving the outputs of the agents to each other asymptotically but do not care what the outputs will synchronize on . in @xcite ,",
    "the linear sor has been addressed for identical multi - agent systems under the dynamic relative state feedback . there",
    "the agents have not only their outputs synchronize but also evolve ultimately on an a trajectory produced by a predefined reference exosystem . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the internal model principle is the sufficient and necessary condition for non - trivial linear output synchronization .",
    "there a dynamic controller has been presented for leaderless sor of linear systems with switching graph .",
    "robust linear sor have been studied in @xcite @xcite by only using relative output information .",
    "the leader - following sor of linear systems with switching graph has been investigated in @xcite .    as for sor of nonlinear multi - agent systems , there are a few works reported .",
    "gazi @xcite has utilized the nonlinear output regulation method to deal with the formation control problem . there , however , the reference signal , which is stricter than the reference system , is assumed to be known by all agents so that the problem reduces to the completely decoupled output regulation problem .",
    "liu @xcite has studied the leader - following sor under the error feedback for a no - loop graph . moreover ,",
    "the robustness is addressed with two extra assumptions : the reference exosystem is linear and the solution of regulator equation are the k - th polynomials .",

    "a networked internal model is proposed for the solution of sor .",

    "this paper addresses the sor problem for general nonlinear multi - agent systems with switching topology .",
    "our framework is similar to that in @xcite and @xcite in that the information delivered among the network is assumed to be the state of the local exosystem constructed by agent itself .",
    "both the dynamic state feedback controller and the dynamic output feedback controller are proposed .",
    "we show that the sor can be achieved without extra conditions imposed on the agent dynamics when the switching graph satisfies the bounded interconnectivity times condition ( jointly connected condition ) .",
