    "electronic energy eigenstates of periodic solids are traditionally represented by bloch waves @xmath0 with a wave vector @xmath1 describing the translational periodicity of a given state .",
    "existence of the well defined wave vector in periodic structures has important consequences for their optical and transport properties imposed in the form of selection rules for inter- and intraband transitions .",
    "therefore , the vast majority of existing theoretical studies that focus on the electronic band structure of solids use a primitive basis ( or bloch ) representation .    in reality",
    ", the ideal translational periodicity of solids is disturbed by disorder in the form of structural defects , fluctuations of the chemical composition in compound alloys , magnetic disorder or even the lack of long - range order in non - crystalline solids .",
    "the disorder can significantly alter electronic structure of solids resulting in the emergence of properties that are strikingly different from their nominal constituencies @xcite .",
    "for example , electronic states associated with substitutional impurities can facilitate optical transitions in otherwise indirect semiconductors @xcite .",
    "modeling of disordered structures requires construction of supercells that greatly exceed the size of a primitive basis .",
    "since the brillouin zone ( bz ) shrinks as a result of the zone folding , the recovery of a dispersion relation @xmath2 in the momentum - energy space becomes non - trivial .",
    "the most successful approach that links the supercell band structure with the primitive basis representation is based on a bloch spectral density @xcite , which is also known as a  spectral weight \" @xcite .",
    "the spectral weight @xmath3 amounts to a bloch @xmath1-character of the @xmath4th energy eigenstates @xmath5 and fulfills the normalization @xmath6 . for symmetric structures ,",
    "the bloch wave vector @xmath7 is unambiguously defined , i.e. , @xmath8 . in supercells with a broken symmetry ,",
    "the energy eigenstate is characterized by broadening of @xmath3 . in the ultimate extreme of",
    "spatially localized states , the uncertainty approaches its fundamental limit of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the localization radius .",
    "the spectral weight can be obtained by a fourier transformation of local basis functions , such as atomic orbitals @xcite , wannier functions @xcite or projected local orbitals @xcite . in the case of a non - local basis set , such as plane waves , the spectral weight can be constructed from the fourier expansion coefficients by gathering them in groups associated with a particular bloch wave vector @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is the most straightforward for implementation in solid - state _ ab initio _ electronic structure codes , since the plane wave ( pw ) expansion coefficients are readily available in pseudopotential or full - potential packages .",
    "here we apply the  spectral weight \" approach to unfolding of the electronic structure of group iii - v and ii - vi semiconductor solid solutions obtained in the framework of density functional theory with the all - electron ` wien2k ` package @xcite . for illustration ,",
    "we investigate ( i ) formation of donor - like states in dilute gap : n and associated enhancement of its optical activity , ( ii ) direct observation of the valence band anticrossing in dilute gaas : bi , and ( iii ) a topological band crossover in a bulk ( hgcd)te compound alloy and related formation of high - mobility kane fermions .",
    "these features , which would have been difficult to identify in standard band structure calculations , become apparent in the unfolded band structures produced by our method .",
    "+    our approach to the calculation of the spectral weight is based on remapping the supercell reciprocal space with a mesh that is compatible with the translational symmetry of a primitive cell @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the basics of this method .",
    "the pw expansion alone @xmath11 or its combination with a local basis set ( such as augmented plane - waves ) is a popular choice for representing wave functions in periodic solids . here",
    "@xmath4 refers to a particular eigenstate ( band index ) , @xmath12 is the wave vector within the first bz and @xmath13 are expansion coefficients .",
    "the summation runs over a set of @xmath14-points repeated with periodicity of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the plane wave cut - off @xmath18 determines the range of the summation and , therefore , the completeness of the basis set . the general form of expansion ( [ eq : a ] ) is identical irrespective of whether a supercell or a primitive cell basis is used .",
    "we will employ upper - case and lower - case notations in order to distinguish between these two cases , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : a ]  ( a , b ) illustrates the reciprocal space mesh in two dimensions for a primitive cubic lattice and its supercell of the size @xmath19 .",
    "each point on this mesh is associated with an individual pw , and can be assigned a relative  weight \" of @xmath20 . when the two meshes corresponding to the primitive cell and supercell overlay as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a](c ) , it is possible to match the supercell @xmath12 and the primitive bloch wave @xmath1 pw expansion coefficients @xmath21 at the points which fulfill @xmath22    as can be seen in fig .",

    "this generates a multitude of  unfolded \" bloch wave vectors , each with its own subgroup of the pw expansion coefficients @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the individual  weights \" of unfolded @xmath24-points are expressed in terms of the pw coefficients which belong to the subgroup of @xmath1 @xmath30 note that the subgroups are formed by the translation vectors @xmath31 , not @xmath32 . in order to facilitate the mapping",
    ", the supercell needs to be generated by translation of the _ primitive cell _ along its lattice vectors in real space , which implies a simple relation between the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath33 .",

    "group iii - v dilute nitride semiconductors continue to be in the focus since the 1990 s as a material system for long - wavelength telecommunication and photovoltaic applications @xcite . in spite of the fact that nitrides ( gan and aln ) are wide - bandgap semiconductors , addition of a small fraction of nitrogen ( a few percent ) in the host iii - v semiconductors , e.g. gaas , results in a drastic reduction of their energy gap .",
    "this narrowing of the band gap is attributed to an anticrossing between extended states of the host conduction band and the localized nitrogen resonant states @xcite .",
    "+     +    ga(np ) was a progenitor of modern dilute nitrides @xcite .",
    "it was shown that nitrogen and its complexes behave in gap as isoelectronic traps by creating a tail of localized states in the vicinity of the conduction band edge @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen - related states facilitate radiative recombination of optical excitations , which is otherwise suppressed due to the indirect band structure of gap @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that disorder also introduces non - radiative channels that have an adverse effect on the internal quantum efficiency of light - emitting devices @xcite .",

    "198 - 199 ) .",
    "our calculations do not purport to reproduce an experimental value of the band gap in gap .",
    "the calculated energy gap of gap is only about 60% of its experimental value , which is due to a shortcoming of the density functional theory ( dft ) in its kohn - sham formulation @xcite .",
    "this drawback is not critical for the purpose of our study since qualitative prediction of the optical emission spectrum is beyond the scope of our work .",

    "this feature is inherent to bloch states with a well defined wave vector @xmath1 , as anticipated for a structure in the absence of a disorder .",

    ", the valence band remains almost unperturbed .",
    "the nitrogen - related states are better seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : c](c ) where the conduction band region is shown with enhanced contrast .",
    "contrary to the extended states of gap , the nitrogen states do not have a well defined @xmath1 and they are only weakly present at the @xmath36-point .",
    "these results are consistent with the localized nature of nitrogen states in gap and confirm their role as recombination centers for optical excitations , albeit slow and inefficient @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic limitations of dilute ga(np ) stimulated exploration of alternative materials for room - temperature optical emitters .",
    "ga(nasp ) is one of the recent developments in the family of dilute nitrides that holds promise for the realization of monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits on silicon substrates @xcite .",
    "it is important to acknowledge that study of random alloys using small supercells without proper configurational averaging may result in artifacts observed in the unfolded band structure due to a periodic ordering @xcite .",
    "this indicates a need to test convergence of the resultant band structure with respect to the size of the supercell as well as the number of random configurations . at this point",
    ", the simulation scale may become computationally prohibitive for dft .",
    "development of an effective hamiltonian , which incorporates effects of compositional disorder , based on first - principles wannier functions @xcite is an efficient technique that enables to overcome this limitation .",
    "furthermore , the configurational averaging can be expedited by constructing special quasirandom structures with relevant radial correlation functions tailored to match a perfectly random structure @xcite .",
    "+      the above example of ga(np ) shows that incorporation of nitrogen is responsible for the modulation of the conduction band in the host semiconductor .",
    "alloying of gaas with bismuth has been proposed as a complementary approach for engineering of the valence band @xcite .",
    "reduction of the band gap in ga(asbi ) is explained using a semi - empirical valence band anticrossing model @xcite .",
    "the model is similar in spirit to the band anticrossing of dilute nitrides @xcite .",
    "recent electronic structure calculations of gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 @xcite performed beyond the popular band anticrossing model provide important insight to the structure of the valence band .",
    "however , the valuable link between electronic eigenstates of the alloy and their dispersion characteristics is overlooked in this analysis .",

    "the band structures of gaas and ga@xmath38as@xmath40bi@xmath39 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] .",
    "their comparison allows us to draw the following conclusions : ( i ) incorporation of bi in gaas mostly affects the valence band , ( ii ) no bound states are found above the valence band edge of the host gaas , ( iii ) the energy gap shrinks along with enhancement of the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "these features are consistent with the experimental trends @xcite and prediction from first - principles of bismuth - related signatures of localization _ beneath _ the host valence band maximum @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize a fundamental difference between gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 and the majority of other group iii - v ternary semiconductors , including gaas@xmath41sb@xmath42 alloy .",
    "gabi is a metal with an anomalous order of bands @xcite , which is reminiscent of the better known @xmath43-sn with a band inversion or negative band gap caused by spin - orbit effects @xcite .",
    "thus , the electronic structures of gaas and gabi have different topology , which is not the case in gaas - gasb , for instance .",
    "the electronic structure of gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 can not evolve  smoothly \" in the range @xmath44 and must undergo a topological phase transition .",
    "this transition is accompanied by a gradual transformation of the host gaas parabolic conduction band to a graphene - like cone with increasing @xmath45 ; electrons ultimately become massless fermions as it will be shown later .",
    "verification of this prediction would require electron transport measurements in gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 for a wide range of @xmath45 .",
    "so far , the successful incorporation of bi in gaas under 12% has been reported @xcite .",
    "the lattice mismatch of 12% between gaas and gabi is one of the main factors that limits their solubility .",
    "hg@xmath41cd@xmath42te ( hct ) is an example of a material system with the topological band inversion @xcite , which is similar to gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 discussed in the preceding sec .",
    "[ sec : results : gaasbi ] .",
    "the arrangement of bands in binary hgte and cdte as well as their symmetry are shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : e](a ) .",
    "the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum of cdte have @xmath46 and @xmath47 symmetries , respectively . in hgte , the order of bands is inverted due to a strong spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "the crossover between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 bands is inevitable in the course of a gradual change in the composition of ternary hg@xmath41cd@xmath42te alloy as illustrated by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : e](a ) .",
    "the prominent feature of hct is the presence of massless kane fermions @xcite at the crossover composition ( fig .",

    "+     +    the evolution of the hg@xmath41cd@xmath42te band structure as a function of composition is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : f ] .",
    "the composition range was chosen to cover the transition from a semimetal with a negative band gap to an insulator .",
    "the negative gap gradually shrinks with increasing the cd content ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f]a ) until three - fold degeneracy is established at a critical composition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f]b ) . at this composition ,",
    "the light hole and electron masses vanish near @xmath36 as it is evident from the conical shape of their dispersion .",
    "@xcite stressed that kane fermions are not protected by symmetry , unlike dirac fermions .",
    "the emergence of kane fermions corresponds to a critical chemical composition @xmath48 .",
    "the critical composition is sensitive to extrinsic factors , such as temperature , pressure .",
    "the band structure calculations yield the critical cadmium content of @xmath49 _",
    "vs_. @xmath50 observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the modest level of discrepancy is largely due to success of the tran - blaha modified becke and johnson ( mbj ) exchange potential @xcite in correcting the energy gap error introduced in regular lda ( local density approximation ) calculations .",
    "the lda - mbj values of the band gap in binary cdte and hgte are 1.56 and @xmath51  ev , respectively , compared to their experimental values of 1.65 and @xmath52  ev @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that lda - mbj accurately reproduces not only the energy gap for insulators , but also performs well for semimetals . without mbj potential ,",
    "the lda results for the band gap in cdte and hgte are 0.3 and @xmath53  ev .",
    "the kane fermions can still be observed , but the critical concentration is heavily shifted towards cd - rich composition @xmath54 .",
    "further increase of the cadmium content beyond @xmath48 leads to a narrow - gap semiconductor with a highly non - parabolic conduction band ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : f]c and [ fig : f]d ) .",
    "apparently , there is no ambiguity in the bloch character for all states near the fermi energy irrespective of the hg@xmath41cd@xmath42te composition ( fig .",

    "there are two arguments why the disorder has such a mild effect on the band structure of hg@xmath41cd@xmath42te .",
    "first , hg and cd have almost the identical atomic radii that results in no local lattice distortions when one element is interchanged by the other .",
    "second , both elements have almost identical the energy level of their valence @xmath59 and @xmath60 electrons which leads to comparable electronegativity of the two elements .",
    "none of these conditions apply to ga(pn ) or ga(asbi ) alloys . as a result",
    ", their band structure is heavily perturbed by the disorder .",
    "effects of alloying on the electronic structure of ga(np ) , ga(asbi ) and ( hgcd)te were studied from first principles . particular emphasis was placed on the bloch character of the energy bands , which is evaluated using a bloch spectral function technique specially tailored to the density functional full - potential package ` wien2k ` .",
    "the success of the theory in predicting chemical trends is validated by reproducing well - known properties of dilute gap : n .",
    "the calculations yield a nitrogen - related band near the bottom of the host gap conduction band . a simultaneous enhancement of the optical activity observed in gap : n is attributed to a weak @xmath36-character of nitrogen - related states within the band gap of gap .",
    "in contrast to the role of nitrogen , incorporation of bismuth in gaas leads to perturbations in the valence band without any noticeable degradation of the conduction band . the valence band dispersion in the energy range of @xmath61  ev below the fermi energy",
    "is significantly affected by disorder .",
    "uncertainties in the bloch character of those states indicate the lost approximate translational symmetry of the host gaas .",
    "based on the analogy between gaas - gabi and cdte - hgte material systems , it is anticipated that the electron effective mass will be reduced as the bismuth content grows .",
    "this trend is common to all compound alloys that combine a semiconductor and a semimetal with the topological band inversion .",
    "a topological band crossover was illustrated by the example of a bulk ternary ( hgcd)te alloy , which manifests in the formation of high - mobility kane fermions previously reported experimentally .",
    "the massless dispersion develops at the composition that corresponds to the semimetal - insulator transition . in contrary to ga(np ) and ga(asbi ) , the compositional disorder practically does not disturb the bottom of conduction band and the top of valence band in ( hgcd)te , which translates to its exceptional charge transport characteristics .
