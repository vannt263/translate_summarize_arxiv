    "due to a number of observations related to high energy events , at present time one important problem in relativistic astrophysics is that of the nature of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "it is usually assumed that black hole solutions are the only models of bhcs .",
    "this together with the construction of various non - vacuum solutions in general relativity for various types of matter and configurations , the question of whether bhcs are black hole solutions or a different solution has been of certain interest . among such alternative solutions are wormholes @xcite , gavastars @xcite , brane world solutions @xcite and boson stars @xcite .",
    "the reason is that astrophysical implications of these solutions can not be distinguished from those due to black hole solutions at distances far from the event horizon region and thus the existence of the horizon itself has become the object of study of bhcs @xcite .",
    "various properties of black hole mimickers are to be studied , being in the first place the stability .",
    "for instance , stability of the whole set of wormhole solutions usually thought of as mimickers is not clear , instead the instability of wormhole solutions has been shown for basic wormhole solutions @xcite , destroying previous hope on the possibility that these are stable as shown in @xcite for particular types of perturbations.on the other hand , the stability of gravastars has been explored and has been found that there are stability regions @xcite .",
    "also on favor of boson star solutions it can be said that the stability of the solutions has actually been exhaustively studied , for instance using perturbative methods @xcite , catastrophe theory @xcite and full non - linear numerical relativity , both in spherical symmetry @xcite and full 3d @xcite , and the stable branches of solutions are well known .",
    "in fact , the study of boson stars has been pushed forward up to the binary boson star collision @xcite and the non - linear evolution of perturbed boson stars @xcite , in both cases considering the system as a source of gravitational waves .",
    "the study of gravitational wave signatures has also been studied in order to tell between a black hole and a gravastar @xcite . instead ,",
    "in the case of wormholes e.g. simple solutions ( supported by a phantom scalar field ) would not stand the perturbative analysis and there is no hope for a study of a binary system , because as shown in @xcite the life time of these solutions is rather short and they should either collapse and form black holes or explode before they could merge , although in @xcite it was shown that charged wormholes can have a longer life - time if the charge parameter is adequately chosen . about a potential full non - linear study of gravastars ,",
    "the challenges are related to the evolution of the fluid and numerical methods should be able to handle very well located distributions of matter , nevertheless some alternative gravastar - like solutions have been proposed to ameliorate the infinitesimally thin shell problem by introducing anisotropies in the fluid @xcite . at the end of the day , if black hole mimickers are to be compared from all the angles with black holes , mimickers should also be expected to do what black holes can do : they collide and generate gravitational radiation with a given fingerprint .",
    "the black hole mimicker models mentioned above are usually compared using the study of the accretion of geometrically thin optically thick disk models , since they are based on the study of time - like geodesics on a fixed background space - time . in this paper",
    "we present a set of boson star solutions that can act as black hole mimickers based on the same accretion disk model as done for the other mimickers .",
    "we show that they appear to be independent of the astrophysical parameters related to the mass of the bhc and the accretion rate . with these results",
    "we find that the power spectrum obtained out of this type of accretion disk model does not suffice to distinguish a boson star from a black hole if the boson star is chosen appropriately .",
    "this paper is a generalization of @xcite , in the following sense : 1 ) we show that a boson star mimicker for one bhc mass is also the same mimicker for other bhc mass by only changing the values of the boson mass , 2 ) we track the mimickers for various values of the self - interaction parameter and 3 ) we present the deflection of light as a method to eventually distinguish a black hole from a boson star .    in order to provide potential predictions that help distinguishing our boson stars from a black hole , we study the light deflection by our boson stars and by the mimicked black hole , show that in the boson star case there is no photon sphere as expected and show the scale at which high resolution lensing would distinguish between the boson star and the black hole .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : bosonstars ] we present the construction of boson star solutions . in section iii",
    "we describe the disk model and the calculation of the power spectrum . in section",
    "iv we present the boson stars able to mimic black holes whereas in section v we present a prediction to falsify our model based on the deflection of light by boson stars . finally in section vi we draw some conclusions .",
    "boson stars ( bss ) are solutions to einstein s field equations minimally coupled to a complex scalar field @xcite .",
    "the scalar field is endowed with a potential of self - interaction that guarantees a global u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "this global phase invariance implies the existence of a conserved charge corresponding to the boson particle number of equilibrium configurations .",
    "the lagrangian density describing a minimally coupled complex scalar field to general relativity reads :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 in units where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the scalar field , the star stands for complex conjugate and @xmath4 is the potential of the scalar field . notice that this lagrangian density is invariant under the global @xmath5 group , and the associated conserved charge is called the number of particles ( defined below ) .",

    "<S> we also show that for each value of the self - interaction a single boson star configuration can mimic a black hole at very different astrophysical scales in terms of the mass of the object and the accretion rate . in order to show that it is possible to distinguish one of our mimickers from a black hole we also study the deflection of light . </S>"
