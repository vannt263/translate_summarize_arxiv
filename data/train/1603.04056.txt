    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , the mpn@xmath2 family shares the common monoclinic structure with the centrosymmetric space group of @xmath18 ( no.12 ) [ see fig .  [",

    "[ fig1](b ) , nbas@xmath2 crystals form one - dimensional chains of nb and as respectively along the @xmath19 axis , which is the fast crystal growth direction . the as - grown single crystals are needle shaped with well - defined facets , among which the ( 001 ) plane is most distinguishable as the largest surface facet [ see supplementary information ( si ) ] . as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1](d ) show the first brillouin zone of mpn@xmath2 , in which the band calculation path and the important symmetry points have been indicated by the red line and solid blue circles , respectively .",
    "noticeably , the residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) , which is a direct indication of single - crystal quality , is significantly lower in nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 ( rrr@xmath20 ) than in tasb@xmath2 ( @xmath21 )",
    ". the discrepancy may be due to the formation of as - vacancies in the former two compounds .",
    "such as - vacancies will introduce sample - dependent electron doping @xcite , as we will discuss in details in the quantum oscillation results .",
    "the monoclinic lattice of the mpn@xmath2 family also produces highly anisotropic fermi surfaces , which is very sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "these two factors may explain the contradicting results of sdh oscillations in taas@xmath2 reported very recently by different groups @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that the nmr phenomena are readily observed independent of the sample quality , a manifestation of its origin in the topological surface states .",
    "it also highlights the importance of observing nmr in tasb@xmath2 , which has nearly perfect compensation with less than 0.1% mismatch between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 populations @xcite , as an example of intrinsic mpn@xmath2 .",
    "before we present the nmr results , it is critical to understand the electronic structure of nbas@xmath2 , taas@xmath2 and tasb@xmath2 respectively , using the first principle dft calculations .",
    "as summarized in figure [ fig2 ] , independent of the soc magnitude and variations in lattice constants , a general feature of the mpn@xmath2 family is unique electron - hole - electron ( @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 ) pockets along the @xmath5 direction . detailed analysis of the valence and conduction bands indicates that the fermi surface of mpn@xmath2 is mainly contributed by the @xmath13-orbitals of the transition metal .",
    "when soc is not included , the m-@xmath6 and m-@xmath7 orbitals form a tilted nodal ring of band crossing along the @xmath5 line @xcite .",
    "once soc is turned on , the band crossing points are completely gapped , creating the characteristic @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 pockets . for nbas@xmath22 ,",
    "the three pockets in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure are very close in the momentum space , which can be better visualized by plotting the three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi surface in the first brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]d ) .",
    "the stronger soc in taas@xmath2 increases the separation between the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 pockets , and the main hole pocket extends noticeably along the @xmath23 direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b and [ fig2]e ) . in both nbas@xmath22 and taas@xmath22",
    ", the dominant @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 pockets are coexisting with four small hole pockets and two small electron pockets , all located at the boundary of the first brillouin zone along the [ 001 ] axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]d and [ fig2]e ) . for tasb@xmath2 , there are drastic changes in the band structures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and [ fig2]f , the main hole pocket in nbas@xmath22 and taas@xmath22 becomes a small shoulder pocket , while the two @xmath3 pockets created by soc in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structures are much enlarged .",
    "it is also distinct that the four small hole pockets in nbas@xmath22 and taas@xmath22 merges into a single large pocket with double saddleback geometry @xcite .",
    "as rooted in the monoclinic lattice , the bandgap opening for the formation of the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure is non - trivial with @xmath8 topological invariants [ @xmath24 being [ 0;(111 ) ] , as shown in the parity table of the eight trim points ( table [ ti - mpn2 ] ) .",
    "the coexistence of non - trivial @xmath8 invariants and large trivial pockets make mpn@xmath2 a unique topological semimetal , as we shown in the following sections .",
    "[ ti - mpn2 ]    the dft prediction on the unique @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure in mpn@xmath2 is supported by the experimental results from t - dependent quantum oscillations of mr ( sdh ) and magnetic susceptibility ( dhva ) . as shown in figure [ fig3]a and [ fig3]b ,",
    "it is not straightforward to using the base - temperature sdh alone to determine the physical origin of different quantum oscillation frequencies , due to the existence of harmonic peaks and possible magnetic breakdown . temperature increase effectively suppresses the secondary peaks , but the intrinsic frequencies remain robust in the mr curves . for nbas@xmath2 ,",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the mr curve at 7.2 k only shows three oscillation peaks of 109.6 t , 234.3 t and 270.5 t respectively , while all high frequency peaks at 1.5 k above 400 t disappear . such differentiation of intrinsic and secondary peaks has been crosschecked by the dhva technique , which is free of the side effects and probes the quantization of intrinsic carrier pockets ( see si ) .",
    "combining these two complementary methods , we confirm the existence of @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure in each compound by assigning the corresponding oscillation frequencies in the mr curves .    for tasb@xmath2 ,",
    "the dft results agree with the experiments very well by predicting the existence of three oscillation frequencies of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for the hole and electron pockets in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure and a trivial saddleback - shaped hole pocket , respectively @xcite . for nbas@xmath2 , there are surprisingly also three prominent frequencies , while the dft calculations predict at least four trivial pockets ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "the unusually strong @xmath28 peak , which is an indication of magnetic breakdown , is also not consistent with the dft results , suggesting well isolated carrier pockets ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "using angle - dependent sdh , we have determined that the @xmath26 peak is the electron pocket in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure , distinct from others by a @xmath29 tilted angle from the @xmath30 axis ( see si ) . by measuring multiple samples",
    ", we found that the changes in @xmath25 is always opposite to @xmath26 , whereas @xmath26 increases or decreases simultaneously with @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "this is partly due to the highly anisotropic fermi surface , and more importantly , an indication of sample - dependent electron doping in nbas@xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , the fermi level of intrinsic nbas@xmath2 is extremely close to the band top of the trivial hole pocket along the @xmath31 line , which is vulnerable to electron doping induced by as - vacancies .",
    "such sample - dependent self doping also brings the electron pocket pair along the @xmath32 line much closer in @xmath33-space , which can explain the unusual @xmath28 peak intensity .",
    "similar to nbas@xmath2 , taas@xmath2 also shows three predominant quantum oscillation peaks , corresponding to the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure ( @xmath25 for the hole and @xmath26 for the electron ) and the electron pocket pairs in the vicinity of @xmath34 ( @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "after zoom - in , a shoulder peak of @xmath35 can be found , which is nearly superimposed with @xmath25 .",
    "this extra peak may be correlated to the two extra pairs of hole pockets in the vicinity of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 points .",
    "t - dependent nernst effect ( s@xmath38 ) of nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 indicate that both compounds are not intrinsic semimetals , evident by non linearity in s@xmath38 even at the base temperature , while tasb@xmath2 has nearly perfect linear s@xmath38 persisting up to 47 k ( fig . [ fig3]d - e and si ) .",
    "the intrinsic semimetal of tasb@xmath2 is also manifested in hall signals ( @xmath39 ) , which is `` u''-shaped at 1.5 k , while nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 have the parabolic - like @xmath39 with negative coefficients , due to significantly more @xmath3 population .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the magnitude of @xmath39 at 9 t and 1.5 k in tasb@xmath2 is one order of magnitude smaller than taas@xmath2 ( 10 @xmath40 for tasb@xmath2 vs 100 @xmath40 for taas@xmath2 ) , as a result of perfect compensation in tasb@xmath2 .",
    "the non - intrinsic doping in nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 also changes the xmr characteristics @xmath39 , which becomes saturating once b exceeds 8 t ( see si ) . for intrinsic tasb@xmath2",
    ", the quadratic growth of @xmath41 is strictly kept up to 15 t @xcite .",
    "independent of the sample quality , nmr has been readily observed in all samples of nbas@xmath2 , taas@xmath2 and tasb@xmath2 at low temperatures when @xmath1 is collinear with @xmath0 . as shown in figure [ fig4]a-[fig4]c , a distinct feature below 1 t is a rapid growth of positive mr .",
    "such sharp mr increase is mainly attributed to the weak antilocalizaiton ( wal ) effect , while the xmr effect induced by non perfectly aligned @xmath1 and @xmath0 only contributes a small part ( see si ) .",
    "the negative mr growth followed the positive mr cusp is non saturating in nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 , which exceeds -60% at 1.5 k and 15 t. for tasb@xmath2 , nmr quickly reaches -50% at 1.5 k and 2 t , then shows an upturn when the xmr signals become dominant at high fields .",
    "such mr upturn is testimony of the high quality of our tasb@xmath2 crystals , which has large than 300% mr even with a small effective @xmath42 of 0.08 t ( estimated by 0.2@xmath43 misalignment ) at 1.5 k. indeed , for low quality samples in which rrr is nearly an order of magnitude lower , the xmr uptown is not present even at 9 t @xcite .",
    "it is also notable that both the low - t wal - associated positive mr and the nmr show distinct b dependence when crossing a critical temperature . for nbas@xmath2 ,",
    "the wal effect becomes much broader and weaker in magnitude at @xmath44 k ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "in contrast , such t crossing points are @xmath45 k and @xmath46 k for taas@xmath2 and tasb@xmath2 respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b and [ fig4]c ) .",
    "the transition is most drastic in intrinsic tasb@xmath2 .",
    "below 20 k , the wal - induced mr is extremely narrow within 0.5 t , above which rapid nmr growth dominates .",
    "in contrast , at 30 k , the wal effect is largely extended to 2 t , but with a much smaller slope .",
    "although nmr becomes non saturating at 30 k , its magnitude at 10 t is nearly halved compared to the result at 1.5 k , despite that b is five times smaller in the latter .",
    "the observations suggest that across the critical temperature , both wal and nmr in mpn@xmath2 may have different physical origins .",
    "intriguingly , 20 k is one of the two lifshitz transition temperatures in tasb@xmath2 , which corresponds to the vanishing of the hole shoulder pocket in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]f and detailed discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . inspired by this finding",
    ", we have also measured the t - dependent seebeck coefficient @xmath47 of nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 , in which lifshitz transitions are the slope change points in @xmath48 @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d and [ fig4]e , the determined lifshitz transition temperature is 65 k and 55 k for nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 respectively .",
    "the @xmath47 deduced lifshitz temperatures for three binary compounds are qualitatively agreeing with the transition temperatures between wal and nmr , and both are consistent with the dft prediction of reducing hole pocket size in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure from nbas@xmath2 , taas@xmath2 to tasb@xmath2 .        although our results suggest a strong correlation between the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure and the anomalous mr in mpn@xmath2 with @xmath49 , it is unlikely that the wal and nmr phenomena are mainly contributed by the trivial pockets .",
    "for trivial spin - polarized pockets in strong soc systems , collinear b and e can induce a smooth crossover from positive mr to negative mr due to the competition between wal and weak localization ( wl ) @xcite , which can be modelled by @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spin flipping length and the phase coherent length respectively , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are constant parameters . the broad crossover from positive to negative",
    "mr lies in the fact that wl has a larger coefficient of @xmath53 but a smaller growth parameter of @xmath51 , compared @xmath54 and @xmath52 in wal respectively . as an intrinsic parameter of soc in the bulk ,",
    "@xmath51 is less sensitive to temperature than @xmath52 , leading to pronounced t - dependent crossover characteristics .",
    "such simplified model can explain the evolution of anomalous mr curves of tasb@xmath2 above the lifshitz transition , but it fails to capture the parabolic - like nmr growth below 30 k unless @xmath51 is unrealistically increased by several order of magnitudes ( see si ) .    by excluding wl of bulk states as the main mechanism , we propose an exotic explanation of topological surface state originated nmr .",
    "due to the unique @xmath8 indices of [ 0;(111 ) ] , most surfaces in mpn@xmath2 are topologically nontrivial with the presence of massless surface states , when the surface miller indices @xmath56 and weak @xmath8 indices @xmath57 satisfy the relation , @xmath58 due to the weak ti nature , dirac surface states must appear in pair with the opposite helical spin structures .",
    "with collinear b and e , the left - handed and right - handed surface dirac cones may be exchanging helical quasiparticles , creating an extra surface conduction channel in analogy to the chiral anomaly in bulk wsms .",
    "the existence of massless surface states in mpn@xmath2 can also explain the low - temperature plateau in resistivity vs t characteristics when b is turned on ( see si and ref .",
    "like the recent reported lasb , the mpn@xmath2 family represents a new class of topological semimetals , with the coexistence of non - trivial topological invariants and large trivial compensated pockets . unlike lasb ,",
    "in which soc opens a direct topological bandgap , the gapping of the @xmath13-orbital crossing in mpn@xmath2 leads to the formation of large trivial pockets with the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure .",
    "the @xmath8 of [ 0;(111 ) ] of mpn@xmath2 make this series a unique platform to study various theoretical proposals for weak tis , in which the topological surface states must appear in pairs with opposite helical spin textures .",
    "the universal nmr observed in mpn@xmath2 present in this study may be a manifestation of the rich physics for such topological weak ti surfaces .",
    "however , the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure in mpn@xmath2 is so dominant that it is very challenging to differentiate the the intrinsic topological surface states from the bulk states .",
    "it would be interesting to search for other compounds with the same @xmath18 lattice for weak ti studies . for tasb@xmath2",
    ", pressure and chemical doping may be able to tune the soc magnitude and thus suppress the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 structure effectively , so that the intrinsic weak ti surfaces can be probed by various experimental techniques .",
    "single crystals of nbas@xmath2 and taas@xmath2 and tasb@xmath2 were synthesized by two - step vapor transport technique using iodine as the transport agent .",
    "polycrystalline samples were first prepared by solid state reaction in evacuated quartz tubes with stoichiometric mixture of transition metal [ nb ( 99.99% ) or ta ( 99.99% ) ] and pnictide [ as ( 99.5% ) or sb ( 99.999% ) ] .",
    "subsequently , the polycrystalline pellets were ground thoroughly and mixed with iodine ( @xmath5913 mg / ml in concentration ) , before being reloaded into quartz ampoules .",
    "the single crystals of taas@xmath2 and nbas@xmath2 were grown in a temperature gradient of @xmath60 for seven days .",
    "the two - zone temperature setpoints for tasb@xmath2 growth are significantly higher of 1223 k and 1273 k respectively .",
    "typical single crystal dimensions are @xmath61 mm@xmath62 , characterized by shining faceted surfaces .",
    "the single crystal and powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) data were collected by a panalytical x - ray diffractometer ( empyrean ) with a cu k@xmath63 radiation and a graphite monochromator .",
    "the rocking curve of the ( 001 ) plane is characterized by the dominant ( 003 ) peak , which has a very narrow full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.06@xmath43 ( see si ) .",

    "the chemical compositions of three different types of single crystals were determined by energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .",
    "the stoichiometry of three compounds are nb : as=1:1.98 , ta : as=1:2.08 and ta : sb=1:2 respectively , showing no trace of iodine residual or other contaminations .",
    "the rietveld refinement of the powder xrd data was analysed by the software rietan - fp @xcite .",
    "electric and thermoelectric transport measurements were performed on a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms-9 t ) and an oxford-15 t cryostat with a he-4 probe . without specific mentioned ,",
    "the magnetic field was applied along the @xmath30 axis , _ i.e. _ the [ 001 ] direction , and the current or temperature gradient was applied along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the thermoelectric properties were measured by the steady - state technique .",
    "the typical temperature gradient used in the experiments is about 0.5 k / mm , which is determined by the differential method using a pair of type-@xmath0 thermocouples .",
