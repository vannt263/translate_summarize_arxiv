    "in this paper , we discuss microscopic details of the structural instabilities observed in ferromagnetic heusler alloys like the magnetic shape - memory ( msm ) system ni - mn - ga @xcite .",
    "these alloys are of technological importance being used for mechanical applications based on specific elastic properties of the martensites . due to ferromagnetic order",
    "magnetic fields allow to control the crystal structure .",
    "ni@xmath0mnga has now become a reference system for all investigations related to the msm technology .",
    "it has been shown that in moderate fields of the order of 1 t , the structural deformations in ni@xmath0mnga can reach @xmath110% @xcite .",
    "this makes the msm technology important for new kinds of micro - mechanical sensors and actuators @xcite .",
    "serious attemps are undertaken to search for new systems which would show even better msm performance @xcite .",

    ", width=302 ]    the msm effect is a completely material dependent property related to the different kinds of martensite formed at corresponding working conditions .",
    "a complete microscopic explanation of the martensitic modulated structures is not available which , however , is the key to understand the different properties of apparently similar heusler alloys like ni@xmath0mnga and co@xmath0mnga .",
    "so far , one has tentatively related the modulated shuffling of the atoms and the phonon softening to the specific shape of the fermi surface of ni@xmath0mnga @xcite . in this way",
    "the kohn anomaly driven by the fermi  surface nesting can lead to the structural instabilities of the crystal .",
    "unfortunately this nesting picture does not give a comprehensive understanding of the micro - mechanics involved in the shuffling of the atoms on the atomic scale .",
    "it also does not allow a complete characterization of the expected strong coupling of the electrons and phonons .",
    "finally atomic disorder , important for the stabilization of the modulated structures , might diminish the impact of nesting features .    with the aim to connect the electron and phonon properties of the heusler alloys we have carried out a series of _ ab - initio _ investigations .",

    "in order to calculate the phonon dispersions we have used the direct force  constant method @xcite .",
    "this method uses the forces calculated via the hellmann - feynman theorem in the total energy calculations for a supercell with periodic boundary conditions , which define to the corresponding dynamical matrix .",

    "the electronic exchange and correlation are treated by using the generalized gradient approximation .",

    "we tentatively argue that this hybridization will be influence by the electron - phonon interaction.,width=219 ]",
    "the calculated phonon dispersions for cubic co@xmath0mnge are shown in fig .",
    "[ comnge ] .",
    "further dispersions not shown here have been obtained for ni@xmath0mnga , ni@xmath0mnal , ni@xmath0mnge and co@xmath0mnga @xcite . in case of ni@xmath0mnga and ni@xmath0mnal the acoustic phonon modes soften in the range of @xmath5 between @xmath10 0.2 - 0.5 and 0.25 - 04 , respectively .",
    "this incommensurate softening is observed in experimental studies and assigned to be at the origin of the modulations @xcite . in case of ni@xmath0mnge",
    "the softening is also present but the l2@xmath11 structure of this crystal is not stable which leads to additional instability at small values of @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to that , co@xmath0mnge ( fig .",
    "[ comnge ] ) and co@xmath0mnga do not show an incommensurate phonon instability .    in order to compare how the softening appears in different heusler alloys we show in fig .",

    "we emphazise here the fact that the position of the softening can be related to the @xmath4 ratio of the corresponding heusler alloy .",
    "figure [ dos ] shows ga and ge site projected dos of ni@xmath0mnga and co@xmath0mnge , respectively .",
    "we note here that the main origin for the phonon instability can be related to nesting of the minority - spin states close to the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the stable systems do not show corresponding nesting .",
    "however , our calculations show additional features primarily related to the origin of the fermi  surface nesting .",
    "namely , in all unstable heusler alloys we find hybridization of unomalously low - lying optical and acoustic phonons .",
    "we expect that this feature leads to an additional strengthening of the electron - phonon coupling because of localized mode  electron coupling .",
    "in particular , this coupling might enhance the interaction of the ni-@xmath12 and ga-@xmath2 minority - spin states .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction will flatten corresponding @xmath12 bands of ni right at the fermi level leading to a nesting shape of the fermi surface allowing for structural instrabilities and the formation of martensitic modulated structures .",
    "in conclusion we can therefore say that the main driving force for martensitic transformations in msm alloys is still at debate and not a completely solved question .",
    "financial support by the german science council ( grk 277 and sfb 491 ) is very much acknowledged ."
