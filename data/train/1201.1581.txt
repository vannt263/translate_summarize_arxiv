    "mattila and vuorinen s proof that quasispheres are locally uniformly approximable by hyperplanes was recently streamlined by prause @xcite , using the quasisymmetry of @xmath2 .",

    "the main difference between mattila and vuorinen s theorem and theorem [ thmb ] is that the former is a statement about the regularity of @xmath50 , while the latter is a statement about the regularity of @xmath4 .",
    "the logarithmic term in ( [ kfinite ] ) is an artifact from the proof of theorem 1.1 , which occurs when we use the maximal dilatation of the map @xmath2 to control the weak quasisymmetry constant of @xmath2 ( see ( [ hdefn ] ) ) .",

    "when @xmath8 and @xmath2 is a quasiconformal map of the plane , @xmath75 ( see theorem 10.33 in @xcite ) .",
