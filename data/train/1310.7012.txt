    "accretion discs around magnetized neutron stars can greatly influence the stellar magnetic field , and magnetic field deformations can in turn have an effect on the angular momentum exchange between the disc and the central object . here",
    "we investigate these deformations and their effect on the neutron star spin .",
    "we focus mostly on the progenitors of millisecond pulsars , which are commonly believed to be descendants of normal neutron stars that have been spun up and recycled back as radio pulsars by acquiring angular momentum from their companion via an accretion disc during the low - mass x - ray binary phase @xcite .",
    "the importance of magnetic fields in accretion discs around neutron stars was recognized already in the early paper by @xcite .",
    "it was already clear then that the most relevant character in the play is the profile of the toroidal component of the magnetic field , @xmath0 .",
    "however , it was only in @xcite that a detailed model was developed .",
    "they pointed out that turbulent motion , reconnection and the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instability allow the stellar field to penetrate the disc and hence to be affected by its velocity field . by assuming a dipole profile for the poloidal component of the magnetic field , they calculated a corresponding profile for @xmath0 .",
    "one of the main consequences of having a non - zero lorentz force inside the disc is the creation of a magnetic torque , which can drastically influence the spin history of the central object and also change the shape of the disc . @xcite",
    "used the solution obtained in @xcite to compute the torque exerted on the neutron star by a keplerian disc .",
    "however in @xcite it was shown that the solution obtained by @xcite violated the induction equation and a consistent analytic profile for the toroidal field was instead calculated , as a stationary solution of the induction equation in axisymmetry . in that model",
    "the poloidal component of the magnetic field was assumed to be a pure dipole ; the disc was assumed to be keplerian , to be in corotation with the neutron star at the upper and lower surfaces and not to have any motion along the poloidal direction ; also , all horizontal derivatives were neglected with respect to vertical derivatives . at almost the same time",
    ", @xcite developed a similar one - dimensional model where , in addition , a non - keplerian profile for the disc was considered and where the horizontal terms in the induction equations were also included . both authors agreed in writing the toroidal component of the magnetic field in the following form , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplification factor , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the disc and stellar angular velocities , respectively , and @xmath6 is the dissipation time  scale . for a dipole @xmath7 , equation  ( [ eq : bp_an ] ) implies @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . in these models ,",
    "the amplification factor @xmath3 was taken to be a constant not much greater than unity ( it depends on the steepness of the transition in @xmath10 , from disc motion in the equatorial plane to corotation at the disc surface ) .",
    "the precise profile of @xmath6 depends on what is the dominant mechanism for dissipating the magnetic field . @xcite",
    "considered three different cases , with @xmath6 being dominated by the alfvn velocity , turbulent diffusion and magnetic reconnection , respectively .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite employed equation  ( [ eq : bp_an ] ) with a dipole vertical field to calculate the magnetic torque .",
    "they found that the magnetic contribution to the torque has the same sign as @xmath11 , i.e. the regions of the disc inwards of the corotation point rotate faster than the star , push the magnetic field lines forward and try to speed the star up , while the regions outwards of the corotation point rotate more slowly , drag the field lines backwards and spin the star down .",
    "@xcite relaxed the approximation of zero poloidal velocity and studied the magnetic field structure only in the inner region of the disc .",
    "his analysis confirmed the results of the previous models .",
    "@xcite addressed the problem from a complementary viewpoint , considering the influence of a given stellar magnetic field on the structure of the accretion disc in terms of its height and surface density .",
    "they also considered the back reaction on the magnetic field , solving both the induction equation ( in 2d ) and the disc - diffusion equation ( in 1 + 1d ) , using different time steps .",
    "they showed that , when @xmath7 is a dipole , equation  ( [ eq : bp_an ] ) is valid only to within a factor of @xmath12 ",
    "@xmath13 on average ; this factor changes with radius and can be as small as @xmath14 for large radii .",
    "@xcite carried out numerical calculations to look for steady - state axisymmetric configurations of a force - free magnetosphere corotating with the central star , treating the interaction with the disc by means of a simple model in which the disc velocity profile had only an azimuthal component ( i.e. no accretion flow ) and horizontal derivatives in the disc were neglected with respect to vertical ones . doing this , they found field - line inflation occurring immediately outside the corotation radius , caused by interaction between the stellar dipole field and the disc , with the field lines spreading out and the local field strength becoming weaker . calculating the resulting torque on the star in a way similar to @xcite , they found that this can then be up to two orders of magnitude smaller than what is obtained if the vertical field is taken to be a dipole ( depending on the boundary conditions and the size of the numerical domain ) .",
    "this phenomenon of magnetic field - line inflation had previously been discussed by a number of other authors in the 1990s ( see @xcite , ) .",
    "it arises due to initially dipolar field lines being dragged round by interaction with the differentially rotating disc matter ; the field - line twisting produced by this leads to inflation of the magnetosphere structure in response to increased magnetic pressure coming from the resulting toroidal component of the field .",
    "there can be associated line opening , leading to loss of part of the magnetic linkage between the disc and the star and to a wind being driven out along the open field lines .",
    "this has been studied in detail by @xcite in the context of classical ttauri stars .    in @xcite ( @xcite ,",
    "hereafter referred to as paper i and paper ii , respectively ) , we commenced a systematic step - by - step study of the how the original magnetic field of the neutron star is distorted by its interaction with the disc .",
    "the strategy was to start with very simple models and then progressively include additional features one at a time , with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms involved .",
    "we started off by focusing entirely on the structure of the magnetic field inside the disc , imposing simple dipolar boundary conditions at the top of it and taking pure vacuum outside .",
    "consideration of interaction with a non - vacuum magnetosphere ( including the phenomena of magnetic - line inflation mentioned earlier ) is reserved for a subsequent stage of the step - by - step programme . in papers i and ii",
    ", the stationary induction equation was solved numerically in two dimensions throughout the interior of the disc , calculating all of the magnetic field components ( i.e. the poloidal field was not forced to be dipolar there ) . as in earlier work ,",
    "axisymmetry was assumed and the kinematic approximation was used ( i.e. the velocity field was specified and then kept fixed during the calculation without including back reaction from the magnetic field ) .",
    "the velocity field was not taken to be purely azimuthal but also had a radial component , as given by the standard @xmath15-disc model of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter s&s ) , and a theta component , introduced so as to match the upper and lower boundary conditions ( imposed through the use of a coronal layer above and below the disc ) was the same as that of the @xmath15-disc ; @xmath16 was zero in the disc , while in the corona it smoothly changed to match the boundary conditions ; and @xmath10 was keplerian in the main part of the disc , smoothly changing to corotation at the inner edge and in the corona . ] .",
    "the results of this analysis demonstrated inward dragging of the poloidal field by the accreting matter and showed that the profile of the toroidal component of the magnetic field can deviate significantly from that given by equation  ( [ eq : bp_an ] ) , depending on the values of the magnetic reynolds numbers .    in this paper , we follow the same methodology as in papers i and ii but apply it now to the disc velocity profile calculated by @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter referred to as k&k ) . in their paper , k&k presented a self - consistent analytic solution for the general structure of the three - dimensional velocity field inside a stationary axisymmetric @xmath15-disc , and we use this here as the basis for our discussion .",
    "we again calculate all of the components of the magnetic field inside the disc : as in papers i and ii , we find significant deviations of the poloidal component away from a pure dipole and of the toroidal component away from equation  ( [ eq : bp_an ] ) whereas , when comparing between the results for the s&s and k&k velocity prescriptions ( which are very different ) , we find that the main overall behaviour is qualitatively rather similar .",
    "we also compute the contributions to the net torque acting on the neutron star which would come from magnetic linkage with the disc . instead of using a simplified expression for the torque , as in the early models ,",
    "we calculate it numerically , within our model assumptions , by computing the moment of the lorentz force using the magnetic field configurations obtained as above",
    ". this calculation will need to be revisited when we subsequently include improved boundary conditions representing a join on to a non - vacuum magnetosphere , but already we are seeing here striking results concerning which regions of the disc spin the star up or down .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model in more detail . in section  [ sec : equ ] , we discuss the equations used for our calculations : we write down the induction equation , describe the velocity field and derive the equation for the torque calculation . in section  [ sec : mfs ] , we present our results for the magnetic field structure , while those regarding the torque are presented in section  [ sec : tor ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "cmp ] , we compare our results with those from papers i and ii and finally , we summarize our analysis in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "our model consists of a neutron star with a dipole magnetic field which is aligned with the common rotation axis of the star and the ( corotating ) disc , everything being axisymmetric .",
    "as mentioned above , at this stage of the project , we are focusing entirely on the structure of the magnetic field inside the disc , imposing simple dipolar boundary conditions at the top of it and taking pure vacuum outside .",
    "the magnetic field is taken to be sufficiently weak in the main part of the disc , so that it does not produce any significant back reaction on the fluid flow .",
    "the approximation of neglecting this back reaction ( the kinematic approximation ) enormously simplifies the set of equations that one needs to solve in order to study the magnetic field structure .",
    "in fact , one then has to solve only the magnetic induction equation , which we do by looking for a stationary configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that close to the stellar surface the magnetic field is strong and dipolar : we are considering a surface field of @xmath17  g , which is typical for millisecond pulsars ( see e.g. @xcite ) . because of the @xmath18 dipolar fall off , as one moves away from the star , the magnetic field intensity decreases outwards quite rapidly and the field lines become progressively more distorted by the matter in the disc . as shown in papers i and ii , this deformation is twofold : ( 1 ) the angular rotation stretches any dipolar field line in the azimuthal direction , thus creating a toroidal magnetic - field component , and ( 2 ) the radial motion likewise has an effect by tending to pull any field line inwards with the accretion flow ( or outwards in the case of a backflow ) .",
    "close to the stellar surface , the magnetic field is strong and completely dominates the dynamics of the matter , i.e. this is the opposite regime to the one in which the kinematic approximation holds .",
    "however , for exactly that reason , in this region we can safely assume that the magnetic field is close to dipolar .",
    "our strategy is therefore not to make any detailed study of what happens in the close vicinity of the neutron star but instead to take the magnetic field there as just being a dipole .",
    "we place the inner edge of the disc at the alfvn radius in the radius of the inner edge . ] and solve the induction equation from there outwards .",
    "the innermost part of the disc is a transition region where the magnetic field does not completely dominate the dynamics of the matter , but where the magnetic torque is sufficient to alter the angular velocity of the matter flow away from keplerian .",
    "we treat this region ( which we refer to as the ` inner disc ' ) by imposing a suitable sub - keplerian profile for the angular velocity there .",
    "the solution of the induction equation in this region is used only to provide suitable boundary conditions for the solution further out , where the kinematic approximation becomes reasonable .",
    "there is another region where the kinematic approximation may not be suitable , and this is near to the surface of the disc .",
    "although the magnetic field intensity decreases quite rapidly with @xmath19 and can be very small for large @xmath19 , the matter pressure here is even weaker since it decreases sharply with @xmath20 , because of the change in density from the disc to the exterior ( here taken to be vacuum ) .",
    "we model this aspect by introducing a boundary layer , which we call the corona , at the top and bottom surfaces of the disc . in this corona ,",
    "the weak magnetic field is less prone to follow the motion of the low  density matter and we reproduce this behaviour in the model by using a larger value of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity there , which helps in reducing distortions away from a dipole ( i.e. away from the boundary conditions ) .",
    "we use this ` by - hand - enhancement ' of the diffusivity also in the inner part of the disc mentioned earlier .    throughout this paper",
    ", we consider a canonical @xmath21 neutron star with radius @xmath22 km , rotation period @xmath23  ms and a surface magnetic field of @xmath24  g , corresponding to a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath25  g @xmath26 . the mass accretion rate is taken to be @xmath27  g s@xmath28 .",
    "a sketch ( not to scale ) of the model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , where the two regions with larger diffusivity are clearly marked : they are the ` inner disc ' and the ` corona ' .",
    "the inner disc extends from the inner edge @xmath29 to the transition radius @xmath30 ( where @xmath31  cm is the schwarzschild radius ) ; the corona extends from @xmath32 to @xmath33 for all radii .",
    "the corotation radius is at @xmath34 and the light cylinder at @xmath35 . to avoid strong dependence on the outer boundary conditions ,",
    "our numerical domain of integration extends much further out than the light cylinder ( dashed lines in the figure ; more details are given in sections  [ ssec : bcs ] and [ ssec : sol ] ) .     and @xmath30 .",
    "for a @xmath22  ms pulsar ( with mass @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the opening angles",
    "are @xmath39 for the disc alone and @xmath40 for the disc plus corona .",
    "the dashed lines indicate that the outer disc extends much further out than the main region shown here : the grid continues until @xmath41 when we are solving for the toroidal component of the magnetic field and to @xmath42 when we are solving for the poloidal one.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in this section , we derive the equations for calculating the magnetic field structure and comment on the profile of the velocity field and on the turbulent diffusivity as well as saying something further about the boundary conditions .",
    "we also derive equations for calculating the magnetic torque exerted by the disc on the neutron star and briefly comment on the solution method .",
    "as mentioned previously , we are making our calculations using the kinematic approximation , within which the velocity field of the disc matter is specified separately ( here following the k&k solution ) rather than being solved for together with the magnetic field calculation .",
    "once the velocity field has been specified , the magnetic field structure can then be obtained by solving the induction equation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mean components of the magnetic field and velocity field respectively , and @xmath46 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity . resolving the full structure of turbulence and studying accretion driven by the magneto - rotational instability goes well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite where the first global axisymmetric simulations of that kind are described . here",
    ", we use average quantities and follow a phenomenological approach for the angular momentum transfer . as in papers",
    "i and ii , we are neglecting the so - called @xmath15-effect , which involves the appearance of a large  scale electromotive force because of the interaction between the turbulent fluctuations in the magnetic fields and the velocity fields .",
    "this term creates a growing solution for the magnetic field and is fundamental when one wants to study dynamo effects . in line with our approach , we want to use a simple model where one can unambiguously understand the roles played by the different contributing factors",
    ". only afterwards will additional ingredients ( such as dynamo action ) be added and their effects studied by comparison with the previous analyses .",
    "we use spherical coordinates ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath47 ) , with the origin of the coordinate system placed at the centre of the neutron star and the unit vector @xmath48 pointing in the direction of the magnetic dipole axis ( and the stellar rotation axis ) . in our model we are assuming axisymmetry ( @xmath49 = 0 $ ] ) and we want to find a stationary solution ( @xmath50 = 0 $ ] ) .",
    "the three scalar components of equation  ( [ eq : ind ] ) are then : @xmath51\\right ]   \\right\\ } \\label{eq : ind_r } \\ , \\,{\\rm , } \\\\   0 & = & \\partial_r \\left\\ { r \\hspace{0.5cm}\\left [ v_r b_\\theta - v_\\theta   b_r - \\frac{\\eta}{r}[\\partial_r(rb_\\theta ) - \\partial_\\theta b_r ] \\right ]   \\right\\}\\label{eq : ind_t } \\ , \\,{\\rm , } \\\\   0 & = & \\partial_r \\left\\ { r \\left [ v_\\phi b_r - v_rb_\\phi + \\frac{\\eta}{r }   \\partial_r(rb_\\phi ) \\right ] \\right\\ } -\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\partial_\\theta \\left\\ { v_\\theta b_\\phi - v_\\phi b_\\theta   -    \\frac{\\eta}{r\\sin\\theta}\\partial_\\theta ( b_\\phi \\sin\\theta ) \\right\\ }   \\,\\ , \\rm{. } \\label{eq : ind_p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two equations are independent of @xmath0 , and so we can solve these first for the poloidal components of the magnetic field and then solve the third equation afterwards for the toroidal component .    in order to solve for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one needs to specify profiles for @xmath54 , @xmath16 and @xmath46 and to solve for @xmath0 one also needs a prescription for @xmath55 .",
    "then , given a set of consistent boundary conditions , the set of equations ( [ eq : ind_r])([eq : ind_p ] ) has a single unique solution .",
    "k&k made a calculation of the three - dimensional structure for an @xmath15-disc , taking the disc to be suitably thin and taylor expanding the equations of viscous hydrodynamics in terms of a small parameter @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a characteristic vertical scaleheight in the disc and @xmath58 is a characteristic radius ( taken , in practice , to be the radius of the neutron star ) .",
    "the equation of state of the accreting medium was taken to be polytropic with constant specific entropy , implying that for any comoving fluid element , increases in entropy due to viscous dissipation are exactly balanced by losses due to radiation and conduction .",
    "they were able to find analytical solutions for the lowest order terms in their taylor expansions and these demonstrated a flow structure which was entirely an inward accretion flow at the top and bottom of the disc but could have an outward backflow near to the mid  plane at radii beyond a certain value .",
    "a similar flow pattern , including equatorial zone backflow , was found by @xcite in a calculation including radiative transfer in an @xmath15-disc modelled with a perfect gas equation of state .",
    "clearly , this flow pattern is very different from that in standard s&s discs and so it was of interest to repeat our earlier calculations of magnetic field distortions by s&s discs also for these k&k ones - viscosity prescription with @xmath59 , for which the issue of large turbulent cells need not arise . indeed , having them would completely change the spectra and character of the s&s solutions .",
    "more sophisticated mri treatments for the effective viscosity have smaller - scale turbulence and _ require _ stratification for successful operation . ] .",
    "the general form of the taylor expansions used by k&k is given in section 2.1 of their paper .",
    "we use here their prescriptions for the poloidal components of the velocity field , @xmath54 and @xmath60 , leaving the rotational velocity @xmath10 as being keplerian in the main part of the disc . due to parity considerations and mass conservation ,",
    "some of the terms appearing in the general form of the expansions are zero , and one is left with the leading - order terms in the expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath60 as being : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a characteristic sound speed in the disc .",
    "the analytic expressions for @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given by equations  2.53 and 2.56 of k&k , respectively .",
    "for implementing this velocity field within our calculation , we first choose the geometrical profile of the disc by specifying the disc height @xmath65 as a function of radius @xmath19 ( note that here we are using @xmath65 and @xmath19 to represent physical lengths and not the scaled quantities used in k&k ) .",
    "we choose this profile as being @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the co - latitude of the disc surface ( for which we take @xmath68 ) .",
    "we sharply truncate the disc at an inner radius @xmath69 ( for which we take @xmath70 ) .",
    "we then specify a quantity which we call @xmath71 , which is the value of the radial velocity @xmath54 at the point @xmath72 .",
    "doing this turns out to be all that is required in order to uniquely determine the velocity field in physical units ( i.e. as unscaled quantities ) . changing the value of @xmath71 is equivalent to changing the value of @xmath15 . from equation  2.55 of k&k , one has ( neglecting @xmath73 corrections ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the keplerian linear velocity and all quantities",

    "we have already commented on the boundary conditions being used for the present stages of our calculations : vacuum everywhere outside of the disc ( plus corona ) and the neutron star , with a dipolar magnetic field throughout those vacuum regions .",
    "this is highly idealized , of course , but it is our working approximation for the moment . in order to have a smooth transition between the disc and the external vacuum , we include a boundary layer , a corona , and then impose boundary conditions at the top of it .",
    "we also impose dipole conditions at the inner and outer radial edges of the disc . at the inner edge , this is done because the magnetic field is strong there and so it is very hard to get any distortions there at all .",
    "what is done at the outer edge is irrelevant anyway because we are placing it so far away that it does not influence what is happening inside the light cylinder , and so we make the simple choice of imposing dipole conditions there as well . in paper",
    "i , we tested various kinds of boundary conditions ( spherical lines , vertical lines and lines with @xmath114 inclination ) and found that for poloidal magnetic field lines entering the extended disc ( i.e. disc plus corona ) at the same locations , their shape within the disc varied hardly at all among the different cases .",
    "however , the values for the _ field strength _ as a function of distance out along the surface of the extended disc will also vary depending on the structure of the external magnetic field and this will clearly influence the magnitude of the magnetic torque exerted by the disc .",

    "we use the first condition directly to calculate @xmath16 in the coronal layer and for @xmath10 we use corotation , which is consistent with the second condition with @xmath122 .      the magnitude of the torque exerted by the accreting matter on the neutron star , is clearly affected by the behaviour of the magnetic field in the magnetosphere . in the present simple model , we are taking vacuum above and below the extended disc so that the magnetic field there remains strictly dipolar , but in the general realistic case there can be field - line inflation , as mentioned earlier , which may also lead to breaking of some of the magnetic linkage between the disc and the star .",
    "it has been suggested that associated opening of field lines might give rise to jets and winds : see , for example , @xcite concerning magnetospheric ejections . in this subsection",
    ", we consider the various contributions to the torque , first giving a rather general discussion and then specializing it to our simplified model .",
    "the disc can exert a torque on the central object via the link provided by magnetic field lines anchored at one end to the neutron star while the other end threads the disc , where the interaction with the moving matter creates a lorentz force which can have a non - zero moment with respect to the central object .",
    "we call this contribution to the total torque @xmath123 .",
    "as matter moves inwards , it encounters a progressively stronger magnetic field which eventually comes to completely dominate the motion of the plasma .",
    "this happens at the inner edge of the disc , where we suppose that matter leaves the disc following the magnetic field lines .",
    "if the magnetic field is then rigidly connected with the neutron star , it will force the matter to move with the same angular velocity as the central object . however , during this motion along the magnetic field lines , the matter is approaching the neutron star , and so although its angular velocity remains constant , there is a progressive decrease in its angular momentum ( the cylindrical radial distance is decreasing ) .",
    "this occurs due to a torque exerted on it by the magnetic field lines , associated with which there is an equal and opposite torque tending to spin up the neutron star .",
    "we call this contribution @xmath124 .",
    "finally , when the accreting matter hits the neutron star surface , it transfers its residual angular momentum to the star .",
    "the torque concerned in this is typically very small , however , and we will neglect it here .    the total torque exerted on the star can then be written as : @xmath125 with @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the moment of the lorentz force ( @xmath128 ) exerted on the neutron star by the local fluid element ; @xmath129 is the volume containing all of the fluid elements associated with the disc which are magnetically linked to the neutron star and for which @xmath130 is non - zero ; @xmath131 is the accretion rate ; @xmath132 is the neutron star spin period ; @xmath133 is the distance from the rotation axis to the inner edge of the disc , while @xmath134 is the corresponding distance for the point where the matter hits the surface of the neutron star and @xmath135 is the unit vector along the rotation axis . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work where the magnetic torque is calculated by computing the integral of the lorentz force through the whole disc , i.e.  by means of equation  ( [ eq : t_bd_def ] ) . in the usual approach ,",
    "only the value at the disc surface is considered .    throughout this work",
    "we express torques with respect to the star , i.e. a positive value means that the torque is spinning the star up , while a negative one produces spin down .",
    "the sign of @xmath136 is always positive : it always acts so as to spin the star up ( positive torque ) because the angular momentum of the matter is decreasing when going from the inner edge of the disc to the neutron star surface .",
    "the sign of @xmath137 , however , is not obvious until the calculations are performed ( see equation  [ eq : torque ] below ) and in general it can be either positive or negative .",
    "we now consider in more detail the contribution to the torque due to the integrated moment of the lorentz force ( i.e. that coming from equation  [ eq : t_bd_def ] ) .",
    "we are calculating the torque with respect to the origin of the coordinate system , and so the radial component of the force has zero moment .",
    "the force acting along the @xmath20 direction is always perpendicular to the position vector and so , if it is non - zero , it will always give a non - zero torque along the @xmath47 direction .",
    "however , since this component is antisymmetric with respect to the equatorial plane ( while the position vector is symmetric ) , the integral of its moment will be zero .",
    "the only non - zero contribution to the net torque comes from the moment of the @xmath47 component .",
    "if we use @xmath138 to indicate the position vector , and write @xmath139 with @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 being unit vectors in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath47 directions , we have @xmath143 where in the last equality we have changed the volume integral into three integrals over the three coordinate directions , integrated over @xmath47 ( giving the @xmath144 factor ) and have explicitly written the direction of the torque as being along the vertical axis ( this implies a change of sign because @xmath141 and @xmath135 have opposite directions ) .    from maxwell s equations in cgs gaussian units ,",

    "the magnetic field follows the plasma motion to a lesser degree , as it should if one assumes that the magnetic stresses eventually truncate the disc ( in fact @xmath52 always stays positive in this region ) .",

    "as soon as magnetic field lines enter the corona , they start to be pushed inwards by the accreting matter .",

    "however , we find some crucial differences with respect to those models : ( 1 ) the relative strength of @xmath0 at the two extrema is reversed and , most importantly , ( 2 ) @xmath0 decreases with @xmath19 much more slowly , and this has consequences for the torque ( see fig .",

    "we split this into two parts : ( 1 ) the torque produced by the interaction between the magnetic field and the disc @xmath202 and ( 2 ) that produced by the accreting matter , leaving the disc at the inner edge and reaching the ns surface along magnetic field lines , @xmath203 .",
    "the standard reference for calculating @xmath202 is @xcite .",
    "here we have modified that approach in two ways : ( 1 ) we drop some of the simplifying assumptions made in calculating the analytic expression for the torque ( i.e. we retain both horizontal and vertical derivatives ) and ( 2 ) for the magnetic field we use our numerical results , rather than the approximated profile of earlier models , although we recall our caveats about our present neglect of line - inflation and possible breaking of magnetic linkage beyond a certain radius in the disc . regarding the dipolar boundary conditions : in paper  i we showed that the shape of the field - lines inside the disc does not depend on the chosen boundary conditions",

    "the situation which they are considering is rather different from ours ( they are studying t tauri stars ) , but if one transfers this result to our case , it would correspond to loss of linkage only at the very edge of the domain used in our plots , where the magnetic torque contribution is negligible anyway .    in the standard scenario developed in the 1980s and 1990s , and",
    "still widely used , the magnetic torque is taken to be proportional to @xmath0 , which in turn is taken to be proportional to the difference between the local @xmath10 of the disc matter and that of the central object , so that the disc inwards of the corotation radius gives a spin - up contribution , while the remaining part gives a spin - down .",
    "we find that this description , although rather reasonable , in fact fails to reproduce the behaviour of a simple two - dimensional disc model , even when the vertical averages of @xmath0 and the magnetic torque are considered ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tor_eta0_4e10_b3cmp_avg ] and [ fig : torque_avg ] ) . for any given configuration",
    ", there is a vertical structure , such that at any radius there are both spin - up and spin - down regions ( at different heights in the disc , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : integrand_cont ] ) whose locations vary with the values of the magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "the sign of the torque mainly follows that of the vertical derivative of the toroidal field , @xmath204 .",
    "we find similar results also when calculating the torque for the models of papers i and ii , with an s&s velocity profile .    within our present model ,",
    "the torque contributions from the inner part of the disc and from the accreting matter inwards of its inner edge are both positive ( acting in the sense of spinning up the neutron star ) while that from the rest of the disc can be either positive or negative .",
    "we have shown that the behaviour of the latter is complicated , and needs to be calculated with care rather than relying on the standard simplified prescriptions . however , for our present restricted model , we find that the net contribution from this region would still be negative ( acting in the direction of spin - down ) , except in extreme cases , and that it would generally dominate over the positive contributions .",
    "this can not be right for the spinning - up of millisecond pulsars , and so we infer that the action of field - line inflation and reconnections in weakening the negative torque from the outer parts of the disc probably plays a crucial role in allowing the overall spin - up .    in this paper",

    "<S> millisecond pulsars are rather weakly - magnetized neutron stars which are thought to have been spun up by disc accretion , with magnetic linkage between the star and the disc playing a key role . </S>",
    "<S> their spin history depends sensitively on details of the magnetic field structure , but idealized models from the 1980s and 1990s are still commonly used for calculating the magnetic field components . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is the third in a series presenting results from a step - by - step analysis which we are making of the problem , starting with very simple models and then progressively including additional features one at a time , with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms involved . in our first two papers , the magnetic field structure in the disc </S>",
    "<S> was calculated for a standard shakura / sunyaev model , by solving the magnetic induction equation numerically in the stationary limit within the kinematic approximation ; here we consider a more general velocity field in the disc , including backflow . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the profiles of the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field are fairly similar in the two cases but that they can be very different from those in the models mentioned above , giving important consequences for the torque exerted on the central object . in particular we find that , contrary to what is usually thought , some regions of the disc outward of the co - rotation point ( rotating more slowly than the neutron star ) may nevertheless contribute to _ spinning up _ the neutron star on account of the detailed structure of the magnetic field in those parts of disc .    </S>",
