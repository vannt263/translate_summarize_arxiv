    "the influence of dzialoshinskii - moriya interaction  @xcite ( dmi ) on properties of domain walls ( dw ) is of high interest during the few last years .",
    "a especially drastic effect of dmi was recently reported for _ perpendicularly magnetized _ ultrathin films : a large tilting of the dw surface was predicted under magnetic field or a spin polarized current driving  @xcite , asymmetric expansion of the circular dw under field driving was demonstrated  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "new types of dw can appear , e.g. dzialoshinskii dw  @xcite and chiral dw  @xcite .",
    "the last one demonstrates very high mobility under spin - transfer torques induced by spin hall effect , this feature undoubtedly can be used for improvement of current controlled magnetic memory devices  @xcite .",
    "this paper has two objectives : ( i ) to study the dmi influence on static and dynamical properties of a transverse dw in _ in - plane magnetized _ narrow stripe , ( ii ) to propose the modified @xmath1-@xmath2 model with an additional pair of canonically conjugated collective variables which enables one to study dynamics of the dw with taking into account the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "first the collective variable approach was used to describe the dynamics of one - dimensional dw more then 40 tears ago  @xcite . up to now the collective variable model proposed by slonczewski  @xcite",
    "is widely used for different types of dws and different drivings  @xcite and it is often called `` @xmath1-@xmath2 model '' . in the frames of this model",
    "the dw dynamics is described by a pair of conjugated collective variables : @xmath1 determines position of the dw and angle @xmath2 determines the magnetization orientation in the dw center .",
    "this model allows one to describe general properties of motion of the dw as a localized object , but it does not take into account internal degrees of freedom of the dw . however one should note a number of papers where the dw width @xmath3 was considered as a third collective variable  @xcite .",
    "but as it was shown in these works the width @xmath3 is a slaved variable and its independent introduction to the model does not allow to describe the internal dw dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we show that due to the dmi the dw gains a deformation whose amplitude @xmath4 can be used as a collective variable conjugated to @xmath3 . in such a modified model the variables ( @xmath5 )",
    "are not slaved and reflect a rich dynamics of the dw internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model of long and thin stripe and discuss the considered interactions in the system . in section  [ sec : statics ] the static dw structure is obtained and deformations caused by dmi are considered . in the section  [ sec : dynamics ]",
    "the modified @xmath1-@xmath2 model is introduced and dmi influence on the dynamical properties of the dw are studied .",
    "results of the paper are summarized in the section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider here a case of thin and narrow ferromagnetic stripe whose thickness and width are small enough to ensure the magnetization one - dimensionality , and the stripe length much exceeds the lateral dimensions .",
    "thus the magnetization is described by continuous and normalized function @xmath6 , where @xmath7-axis is orientated along the stripe and @xmath8 denotes time . since @xmath9 it is convenient to proceed to the angular representation @xmath10 where angle @xmath11 describes the deviation of magnetization from the magnet axis and angle @xmath12 determines orientation of vector @xmath13 in plane perpendicular to @xmath7-axis .",
    "these notations are also explained in the fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] . to describe the magnetization dynamics we use the phenomenological landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations which in terms of angular variables have the form    [ eq : llg - angles ] @xmath14    here the overdot indicates the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath15 , where @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath18 being the saturation magnetization and @xmath19 is the normalized energy with @xmath20 being the area of the stripe cross - section .",
    "@xmath21 indicates the gilbert damping .",
    "typical scale of the physical quantities can be illustrated by the example of permalloy : @xmath22  ghz , @xmath23  mj / m@xmath24 , and @xmath25 .     and",

    "angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 determine orientation of the magnetization vector @xmath13 . ]",
    "we assume that energy of the system has the following form    [ eq : biax - e - field ] @xmath27\\mathrm{d}z ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in denotes the exchange energy @xmath28    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 being the exchange length and prime denotes derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate @xmath7 , e.g. @xmath30 .",
    "the second term describes the anisotropy @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants of the easy - axis and easy - plane anisotropies respectively .",
    "the easy - axis is orientated along the stripe ( @xmath7-axis ) whereas the easy - plane coincides with the stripe plane ( @xmath34 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the anisotropy is chosen in such a form because for the thin and narrow stripe the expression   approximately models the stray - field contribution originated from the surface magnetostatic charges@xcite .",
    "also the anisotropy term   allows the head - to - head ( tail - to - tail ) transverse dw  @xcite which is the subject of this paper .",
    "energy of the dzialoshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) is taken in the form typical for cubic crystals with t symmetry  @xcite @xmath35=-\\frac{d}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\phi ' ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalized dzialoshinskii constant @xmath36 is measured in units of length , therefore the comparison of @xmath37 and @xmath29 is equivalent to the comparison of strengths of the dmi and exchange contributions .",
    "the expression can be written in the equivalent form @xmath38 $ ] where the dzialoshinskii vector @xmath39 is collinear with the stripe ; the case when the dzialoshinskii vector is perpendicular to the one - dimensional magnet is considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the last term @xmath40 corresponds to interaction with the external magnetic field @xmath41 , which is measured in units of the saturation field and is applied along the stripe .",
    "in this section the no - driving case @xmath42 is considered and all the following analysis is based on the static form of equations  :    [ eq : stat - eqs ] @xmath43    without dmi ( @xmath44 ) the ground state of the system with energy is doubly degenerated : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the transition between domains of different ground states forms a dw .",
    "structure of the dw can be found as a solution of with boundary conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( case of head - to - head dw ) .",
    "this solution is well known  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is width of the static dw which originates from the opposite boundary conditions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as case @xmath53 is absolutely analogous to the considered one . ] .",
    "nevertheless the dw solution does not satisfy the equations in case @xmath54 . in the following we obtain deformation of the dw solution   induced by the dmi , considering the dmi as a small perturbation @xmath55 . with this purpose",
    "we introduce small deviations from the non - perturbed solution   @xmath56 substituting now into and linearizing the obtained equation with respect to the deviations one obtains the following equation for the deviation @xmath57 @xmath58 the corresponding equation for @xmath59 originated from is homogenous one @xmath60 , and besides the trivial solution is of higher order of smallness than linear one with respect to the perturbation : @xmath61 . ] @xmath62 it also has a solution @xmath63 which corresponds to the translational shift of the dw  .    physically important solution of must be bounded one .",

    "accordingly to the amplitude of the dw asymmetry @xmath4 is canonically conjugated momentum to the dw width @xmath3 , as well as dw phase @xmath2 is canonically conjugated momentum to the dw position @xmath1 . the effective energy in reads",
    "@xmath81 here we assume that @xmath82 and therefore only terms linear and quadratic with respect to @xmath4 are considered .",
    "the dissipative function can be obtained in the similar way by substituting the ansatz into : @xmath83\\bigr\\}\\ ] ] lagrangian and dissipative function produce a set of equations of motion which in the lowest approximation with respect to @xmath4 can be written in form    [ eq : cv - eqs - motion ] @xmath84    where matrix @xmath85 reads @xmath86 equations have the solution in form of translational motion @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in a low damping case ( one neglects terms @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) the parameters of this translational motion are the following @xmath94    thus in linear approximation with respect to @xmath4 the translational motion of the dw is the typical one for a biaxial magnet  @xcite except appearance of the asymmetrical deformation with amplitude @xmath95 .",

    "the dmi reduces values of these quantities and the corresponding corrections are proportional to @xmath105 .",
