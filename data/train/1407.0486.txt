    "the combination of a well defined active site and a robust and flexible macrocycle , as well as the possibility to incorporate a multitude of metal centers and attach a wide range of substituents , make tetrapyrrole molecules , such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines , attractive for a wide range of applications .",

    "the dimensionality ranges from 0d ( as single active sites@xcite ) to 3d ( in metal - organic frameworks@xcite ) , whereas devices such as organic solar cells @xcite or organic light emitting diodes ( oleds ) @xcite generally require comparatively thick layers.@xcite as the physicochemical properties of these systems often depend on the adsorption geometry and the orientation of the molecules both with respect to each other and the surface , it is of great importance to achieve excellent control over the growth processes of porphyrin films .",

    "this broadening was empirically determined to reproduce the experimental spectra by accounting for the reduced lifetime of the @xmath18 resonances which leads to increasing widths.@xcite    the missing core hole relaxation in the tp approximation can be corrected by shifting the spectra by the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 from eq .",

    "this section is therefore dedicated to a detailed analysis of the xps and nexafs signatures of free - base porphine by comparison to theoretical calculations .",

    "the c  1__s _ _ region of a multilayer grown on cu(111 ) at lt ( see methods and section [ subsec : multi_cu ] ) exhibits three main structures ( fig .  [",

    "the contributions to these two features can be grouped according to whether the respective carbon atoms are directly bound to a nitrogen atom ( c2/c4 , shoulder b ) or to other carbon atoms ( c1/c3/c5 , feature a ) .",
    "it is important to note that feature s is not reproduced .",

    "the simulation of the respective ionization energies shows no indication for a packing - induced modification of the xp spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dimers]e ) , thus indicating that the comparison of single molecule calculations to multilayer data is justified .    by the same methodology , the nexafs k - edge spectra of the nitrogen and the carbon regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nexafs_stobe ] ) can be analyzed .",
    "the n k - edge spectrum of ( see supporting information and ref .  ) is characteristic for porphyrins@xcite and can be deconvoluted into two sets of spectra , originating from the two chemically different nitrogen species.@xcite the great similarity to the spectra of substituted porphyrins , such as , indicates that the electronic structure of the macrocycle , or at least its center , is hardly affected by the attached substituents as long as they are neither of strong electron accepting nor donating character .",
    "[ fig : nexafs_stobe]a compares the measured c k - edge multilayer data ( black markers ) to the simulated curve ( red continuous line ) .",

    "the five single , simulated spectra originating from the chemically different carbon atoms in the molecule ( fig .",

    "the molecules are clearly planar,@xcite while a small deformation ( 10 - 15@xmath0 ) can not be ruled out on cu(111 ) , as the stronger interaction with the substrate leads to a general broadening of the nexafs features.@xcite the partially quenched first peak was attributed to a partial filling of the lumo due to electron transfer from the substrate , in agreement with calculations for on cu(110).@xcite the strong interaction is also reflected in the drastically modified appearance of the c  1__s _ _ xp spectrum ( fig .

    "a tentative explanation is that the strong interaction of the carbon atoms with the potential of the copper substrate entails a strong chemical environment on the carbon atoms that overwhelms the intramolecular differences and only two sharp main peaks remain .    as mentioned in ref .",

    "[ fig : growth_cu ] ) . the corresponding nexafs and xps",
    "signatures appear to be a mixture of first- and multilayer signals .",
    "the average tilt angle of the molecules in this bilayer is 25@xmath0 , indicating that for coverages exceeding 1  ml the molecules start to tilt . from our spectroscopic data",
    "solely it can not be concluded whether all molecules tilt uniformly@xcite or only the second layer molecules tilt . for low deposition temperatures ( @xmath33 = 150  k ) , however , the two layer limit can be overcome and thick multilayer films can be fabricated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_cu ] , bottom ; see also figs . s6 and s7 ) .",
    "the pronounced dichroism in the nexafs data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_cu]a , bottom ) indicates a highly ordered film .",
    "fitting of the nexafs data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_cu]b , bottom ) yielded an average tilt angle of 30@xmath0  with respect to the cu surface , which may either point to a uniform tilt of all molecules ( see illustrations in fig .  [",
    "fig : growth_cu ] ) or , as nexafs averages over all domains , to a more random distribution .",
    "the xps and nexafs spectra of such low temperature grown samples were used in fig .",
    "[ fig : xps_stobe ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nexafs_stobe ] for the comparison with the simulations , the good agreement points to weakly interacting molecules in the multilayer .",
    "the surprising importance of the second layer for the growth modes of porphine is reminiscent of the case of benzene adsorbed on cu(111 ) .",
    "there , the organic rings also adsorb flat in the first layer.@xcite increasing the coverage leads to the formation of a stable bilayer , in which the benzene units of the second layer are oriented perpendicular to the first layer .",
    "the second layer is special in that sense that it has a slightly higher ( 5  k ) desorption temperature than the molecules in the multilayer.@xcite in our case , however , the small nexafs angle rules out a completely upright standing second layer .",
    "this could be explained by the larger size of the porphine molecule , possibly resulting in a stronger interaction between the first and second layer molecules .      to study the influence of the substrate on the growth of we repeated the experiments on the ag(111 ) surface and again investigated the corresponding growth both at rt and lt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_ag ] ) . throughout the whole coverage range from submonolayer to thick multilayers",
    "the number and shape of the dominant resonances remain the same ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_ag]a ) and agree well with the theoretically calculated monomer curves discussed in section [ subsec : charac ] .",
    "as mentioned above , in the first layer the molecules adsorb undeformed and parallel to the surface , as indicated by the vanishing 90@xmath0-curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_ag]a , top ) . with increasing coverage the intensity of the 90@xmath0-curve increases until the dichroism is reversed for the thick multilayer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_ag]a ) .",
    "because of the coverage - dependent orientation and the related complex damping of the first layer signals , the coverages can not be quantified accurately , but we estimate the multilayer to be approximately 8 ml thick . for the thickest obtained layer the average molecular tilt angle was determined to be 80@xmath0  ( @xmath3410@xmath0 ) i.e. , the molecules are oriented almost perpendicular to the surface .",
    "remarkably , this phase differs substantially from the crystal phase,@xcite which consists of porphine dimers stacked in a t - shape fashion .",
    "this clearly points to templated growth inducing a multilayer film consisting of uniformly oriented upright standing organic constituents .",
    "templating growth is an important approach to control and optimize the properties of organic thin films.@xcite accordingly , the epitaxial influence of well - defined substrates on the growth modes of a variety of functional species is intensely investigated.@xcite a behavior comparable to the one reported here was observed by shnchen and co - workers when analyzing the growth of pentacene on cu(110 ) .",
    "they found flat molecules at low coverages , a perpendicular orientation for thick layers and a third phase in between.@xcite they postulated that the intermediate phase is formed due to the good fit between this structure and the ( flat ) monolayer , but that for thicker films the stress inside the film becomes larger , which favors a film structure with a lower surface energy.@xcite the same observations and interpretations were reported for pentacene on au(111).@xcite we tentatively follow this interpretation as explanation for the different observed phases .",
    "[ fig : growth_ag]c shows the corresponding c  1__s _ _ xps curves , whose shapes change in a systematic manner .",
    "unlike the spectra measured on cu(111 ) , a very broad structure is visible at ( sub)monolayer coverages ( fig .  [ fig : growth_ag]c , top ) , which transforms to a more defined shape for the multilayer of upstanding molecules .",
    "none of the four depicted spectra matches exactly the monomer spectrum predicted by dft calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xps_stobe ] ) .",
    "the multilayer spectrum shows the highest resemblance , but even with a broadening of 0.7  ev for the simulated curves the sharper experimental features can not be reproduced exactly .",
    "similarly , dft simulations of porphine dimers and chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dimers ] ) do not reproduce these observed differences in the measured data , excluding the possible influence of the nearest neighbor molecules .    ) and hardly show any dependence on the photon energies , while those of the highly ordered rt structure at ag(111 ) ( b ) are narrower and photon energy dependent .",
    "the latter finding can be explained by ( c ) simulations for an upright - standing geometry and assuming attenuation of the signal originating from the lower parts of the molecules . ]    dosing at low temperature on ag(111 ) results in the same molecular coverage as dosing at room temperature . however , the average tilt angle of the molecules is 30@xmath0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_ag ] , bottom ) instead of 80@xmath0  for the layers grown at rt and thus identical to the angle measured for a multilayer grown on cu(111 ) at lt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_cu ] , bottom ) .",
    "the corresponding xp spectrum differs from that of the ordered layer consisting of upright - standing molecules and is much more similar to both the calculated curve for the monomer and the c  1__s _ _ spectrum of the multilayer grown on cu(111 ) at low temperatures .      the c  1__s _ _ photoemission signal corresponding to the rt multilayer on ag not only exhibits a modified ( sharper ) shape , but is additionally shifted to lower binding energies ( see fig .  [ fig : lambda ] and fig .",
    "s5 ) , which is an indication that the upright room - temperature phase of 2h - p / ag(111 ) is much more ordered than the low - temperature films on both ag(111 ) and cu(111 ) .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] shows that the c  1__s _ _ spectra of room temperature and low temperature films not only differ in shape , width and energy position , but also react differently to a change in the incidence photon energy @xmath6 . for the flatter lt layer on cu(111 ) hardly any change in the relative intensities of the spectroscopic signatures is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda]a ) , whereas the intensity of the high - energy shoulder of the perpendicular 2h - p layers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda]b ) clearly depends on the photon energy , i.e. , the kinetic energies of the photoelectrons .",
    "a variation of the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons leads to a modified inelastic mean free path of the electrons.@xcite therefore measurements with 385  ev ( e@xmath35 @xmath36 100  ev ) are much more surface - sensitive and only probe the topmost parts of the molecules .",
    "photoelectron diffraction effects are neglected here , due to the large integration angle selected by the operation mode of the electron energy analyzer . a first tentative explanation of the photon dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda]b takes into account that the molecules are oriented differently . for flat molecules the photon energy @xmath6 should not change the shape of the spectra , as at normal emission electrons originating from inequivalent carbon atoms have to travel the same distance in the film . for perpendicularly oriented molecules the photoemission signal from atoms at the bottom of the porphine",
    "are attenuated due to the larger distance traveled through the material before reaching the detector . to quantify this effect , we performed depth - resolved xps simulations . to this end",
    "we considered two perpendicular orientations of the molecule where either one of the iminic nitrogen atoms , or one of the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms is closer to the surface .",
    "[ fig : lambda]c displays the superposition of both .",
    "the topmost carbon atoms are set to @xmath37 , i.e. , their signal is not attenuated .",
    "the intensities of the signals originating from all other atoms @xmath38 at depth @xmath39 are modified according to @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the non - attenuated intensity at @xmath42 0 , which is always set to @xmath43 in the simulation and @xmath44 is the attenuation length .",
    "the resulting shape for different values of @xmath44 varies for both orientations .",
    "since the porphine molecule is symmetric the effect of the attenuation is not as strong as it would be for an asymmetric molecule , as there are always weak and strong contributions from the same kind of carbon atom .",
    "hence , only at short attenuation lengths are differences predicted in the spectrum . even though for some systems the inelastic mean free path can be as short as 3    at 100  ev kinetic energy,@xcite our derived values for @xmath44 seem to be smaller than would be expected from literature values of various organic compounds.@xcite this might be explained by the fact that in our approach packing effects , as well as small deviations from an ideal perpendicular orientation , and different orientations of the porphine molecules are not taken into account , which might have a small quantitative effect .",
    "nevertheless , the trend of the photon energy dependence of the experimental curves is reproduced by the calculations and the results are consistent with the molecular orientation derived from nexafs spectroscopy measurements .      to get more insight into layer formation pathways",
    ", we investigated how the orientation of the molecules responds to changes in the temperature after deposition . to this end",
    ", multilayers of were dosed on cold ag(111 ) and cu(111 ) substrates , which leads to films with average adsorption angles of 25 - 30@xmath0 .",
    "slow annealing to room temperature leads to a partial irreversible reorientation of the molecules on both substrates , namely to an increase in tilt angles with respect to the substrate ( fig .",
    "s6e and i ) , though the effect is more modest on the cu(111 ) substrate .",
    "unfortunately , the re - orientation is on both substrates accompanied by a partial desorption of the molecules as evidenced by xps ( fig .",
    "s6f and j ) , so that no distinctive new phases could be achieved .",
    "a different behavior was observed for a different batch of molecules which contained chlorine and oxygen contaminants .",
    "after evaporation at lt again thick films with an average tilt angle of 30 - 40@xmath0  were achieved ( fig .",
    "s6 c and g ) .",
    "for these films slow annealing to rt led to temperature - stable multilayers which completely switched to a perpendicular orientation on both substrates without substantial molecule loss ( fig .",
    "s6 d and h ) .",
    "this implies that the contaminants stabilize the layers ( either by a chemical effect or by introducing a different intermolecular spacing ) or lower the energy of the transition and , most importantly , that by this procedure ordered , upright standing layers can be achieved not only on ag(111 ) , but also on cu(111 ) .    this molecular re - orientation on cu(111 )",
    "allows the self - metalation of on cu(111)@xcite to be studied . for bilayers deposited at room temperature and thicker films grown at low temperatures ( mostly flat molecular orientation in both cases )",
    "all molecules are metalated at 393  k as evidenced by the single peak present in the n 1s xps ( fig .",
    "s7a and b ) .",
    "however , the multilayer with the chlorine and oxygen contaminations , ( grown at lt , then warmed up to rt ) , which has already switched to an upright orientation , remains nearly unchanged after annealing to 393  k. even after further annealing to 433  k this contaminated film is not fully metalated .",
    "this indicates that ( i ) the nitrogen atoms need to be close to the surface in order to capture a copper atom from the substrate , which is prevented by the limited mobility of the stacked porphines , and ( ii ) that , presumably , even the first layer of porphine molecules , which is in direct contact with the substrate , has already begun to tilt .",
    "we explored the growth of a prototypical tetrapyrrole compound , 2h - porphine ( 2h - p ) , on the coinage metal surfaces ag(111 ) and cu(111 ) using a combination of x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and near - edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) spectroscopy and simulated spectra from density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "polarization - dependent nexafs measurements reveal the adsorption geometries of the porphines : on both substrates for coverages up to one monolayer the molecules bind without appreciable distortion and parallel to the respective metal surface . for higher coverages the orientation of the molecules depends on the chosen substrate and its temperature during the growth of the films ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) .",
    "multilayers grown at low temperatures ( lt ) exhibit a similar average tilting angle ( @xmath45 30@xmath0 ) on both substrates .",
    "the corresponding carbon xp and nexafs spectra agree very well with the simulated gas phase spectra , and therefore the contributions of inequivalent atoms can be successfully disentangled .",
    "specifically , the features observed in both spectra can be decomposed into two groups : peaks at lower binding energies stemming from carbon atoms exclusively connected through c - c bonds , and a second set of peaks at higher binding energies originating from c - n bonded environments .",
    "a remarkably different behavior is observed for molecules dosed at room temperature .",
    "on cu(111 ) the growth is limited to a coverage of approximately two layers , while on ag(111 ) thick multilayers can be grown without restriction .",
    "the molecules in these multilayers are , in contrast to the 2h - p bulk crystal structure , uniformly oriented with the molecular plane perpendicular to the metal surface .",
    "notably , different molecular orientations result in a modified shape of the c  1__s _ _ xps curves .",
    "the dependence of this shape on the incidence photon energy can be rationalized using depth - resolved dft calculations by taking into account the different attenuation of the various c  1__s _ _ contributions of varying depths .",
    "on the other hand , simulations of ionization energies for differently stacked molecules show no indication for a packing - induced modification of the xp spectra .",
    "interestingly the adsorption geometry also has an influence on the self - metalation on cu(111 ) , which is prevented or at least hindered for the perpendicularly adsorbed porphines , an effect that was attributed to the reduced contact with the substrate .",
    "a seemingly simple organic - metal surface hybrid system thus presents a surprisingly rich behavior , where the growth conditions and interfacial bonding gives rise to distinct layer geometries , none of which reflects the ordering principles of the bulk organic material .",
