    "dajani , kraaikamp and steiner @xcite introduced a generalization of both the @xmath0-continued fractions of nakada @xcite and the rosen continued fractions @xcite . using direct methods , similar to those of @xcite for the classical rosen fractions , they determine in @xcite natural extensions for certain of their @xmath0-rosen fractions .    here",
    "we give a method that begins with the explicit region of the natural extension of a rosen fraction ( as already determined in @xcite ) and determines the regions for the natural extensions for various @xmath0-rosen fractions .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that one easily sees that these various @xmath0-rosen fraction maps determine isomorphic dynamical systems ; in particular the associated one - dimensional maps have the same entropy .",
    "this can be compared to results on the entropy of nakada s @xmath0-continued fractions , obtained by nakada @xcite and others @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we define all notation below , here we simply note that for each @xmath1 and all appropriate values of @xmath0 , one can define an @xmath0-rosen continued fraction map @xmath2 on @xmath3 . when @xmath4 , the map is the original map of rosen ; @xcite showed that the domain of the natural extension is connected for all @xmath5\\,$ ] .",
    "we determine the least @xmath6 such that for all @xmath7\\,$ ] the natural extension is connected .",

    "* furthermore , let @xmath13 then the entropy of the @xmath0-rosen map for each @xmath14\\,$ ] is equal to the entropy of the standard rosen map .",
    "( here , `` the domain of the natural extension of @xmath2 '' refers to the largest region on which the standard number theoretic map  defined below in equation    is bijective . )",
    "the value of the entropy of the standard rosen map was given by h.  nakada @xcite , and is equal to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normalizing constant ( which depends on the parity of the index @xmath17 ) found by @xcite .",
    "we recall the value of @xmath18 in equations and .",
    "our approach is to determine the domain of the natural extension using a standard `` number theoretic '' two - dimensional operator , here @xmath19 ( depending on both @xmath20 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "the domain for rosen fractions , denoted here by @xmath21 , was obtained in @xcite . for fixed @xmath20 and given @xmath0 , we determine our domain by adding and deleting various regions to @xmath22 by a process that we informally refer to as `` quilting '' .",
    "the regions are determined from appropriate orbits of the strips in @xmath23 above intervals where the @xmath2-``digits '' ( see below ) differ from the @xmath24-digits .",
    "these strips are mapped by @xmath25 to a region that must be deleted , their image under @xmath26 must be added ; thereafter their further @xmath26-orbits are deleted and added , respectively .",
    "our approach succeeds without great difficulty exactly because in a small number of steps the orbits of the added regions agree with the orbits of the deleted regions  the infinitely many potential holes are quilted over by the added regions .",

    "we also identify a region of @xmath23 that obviously can not be part of the new natural extension , as its marginal projection lies outside of @xmath53 .",
