    "in our recent paper @xcite the problem of penetration of a given area @xmath11 by deterministic robots , referred to as ants , has been considered . in that model ,",
    "ants could exchange information on areas they had been visited .",
    "new scaling relations have been proposed for the time of penetration against the number of ants @xmath0 and the system size @xmath12 , where @xmath13 was the linear size of the system . in particular , the time @xmath14 when all ants know the whole area has been found to be proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 was the ant density .",
    "the related exponents @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been found numerically as 0.69 and -0.4 , respectively .",
    "+ the aim of the present note is to verify the role of the spatial fluctuations of the initial positions of ants in the value of @xmath17 .",
    "our question is as follows : provided that @xmath19 = const , the size dependence of @xmath14 can be partially attributed to the fact that some ants are initially more far from their neighbours . then , those ants need more time to meet other ants and collect the information from them .",
    "how , then , does the maximal distance @xmath7 between nearest neighbours depend on the area @xmath11 ?",
    "+ in the picture based on diffusion , an ant can be represented by a sphere of radius @xmath20 , and @xmath21 increases linearly with time . out of this sphere , the probability of meeting of the ant is zero .",
    "a meeting of two ants is then equivalent with a collision of two spheres .",
    "the time @xmath14 is expected to be dominated by @xmath22 .",
    "this picture is justified for @xmath23 and perhaps for @xmath24 , because in a low - dimensional space trajectories fill the spheres densely , but not for @xmath25 .",
    "as we demonstrate below , the obtained scaling relation can be written in a compact form , the same for @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "the price paid for this simplicity is a substitution of the difficult random walk problem by the diffusion model .",
    "+ we note that the relation @xmath27 can be formulated in terms of the probability distribution of an extremal value @xcite of the distance between random points @xcite .",
    "this formulation should allow to get the mean of the maximal distance to a nearest neighbours through the formalism of generating functions .",
    "yet , the numerical procedure applied here seems much simpler than the approach with use of special functions @xcite .",
    "+ in the next section , we describe the simulation developed to get the relation @xmath28 , and the numerical results for the dimensionality @xmath1 = 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "last section is devoted to discussion .",
    "the simulation is performed as follows .",
    "a @xmath1-dimensional area @xmath2 with periodic boundary conditions is filled with @xmath29 points of randomly selected positions . for each point",
    "@xmath3 = 1, ... ,@xmath0 we find its distance @xmath4 to its nearest neighbour .",
    "next , we find the maximal value of @xmath4 , denoted as @xmath7.this is done for @xmath13 varying with @xmath19 = constant , and for @xmath1= 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the number of points is taken as @xmath30 .",
    "+ the results are shown in fig .",
    "the adopted density is @xmath6 is ... yet , as we see , the obtained plot indicates the scaling relation @xmath8 , with @xmath31 close to 0.24 for all investigated dimensionalities @xmath1 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath31 is bounded by fitting error which varies from 0.02 to 0.04 for different dimensionalities .",
    "+     and the linear size @xmath13 of the system , for the dimensionality @xmath1 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 from bottom to top .",
    "each point is an average over 10 runs.,width=472 ]",
    "to compare the obtained scaling relation with the result @xmath32 for @xmath24 @xcite , we substitute @xmath33 .",
    "this gives @xmath34 .",
    "provided that the sphere area @xmath35 , as follows from the diffusion model , we get the time @xmath36 .",
    "this exponent is clearly less than @xmath37 , obtained in @xcite .",
    "as the ants are designed to omit their previous paths @xcite , an alternative assumption could be done according to the self - avoiding - walk model @xcite , where for @xmath24 the rule is @xmath38 .",
    "then we get @xmath39 , what is even more far from @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the observed value of the exponent @xmath17 can not be attributed solely to the fluctuations of the initial density of ants . for completeness",
    "we may add that @xmath41 for purely geometrical reasons .",
    "+ the scaling relation @xmath8 , which appeared as a by - product of the considerations of search - and - rescue robots in a labyrinth @xcite , can find applications also in other areas .",
    "an example is a spatial set of sensors ; two sensors interact if their distance is not larger than a prescribed value @xcite .",
    "yet , the distance in other than geometrical , high - dimensional space can play the same role .",
    "namely , in a network of of time series of biological or economic series of data @xcite as points and their mutual correlations as bonds , a least correlated signal in a network is equivalent to the maximally distant point .",
    "there , the signal length is a counterpart of the space dimensionality @xmath1 , and the range of the signal  of the linear system size @xmath13 . with this interpretation",
    ", our results can be helpful to identify outliers in data .",
