    "recently , our group has been working on three - dimensional , fully relativistic simulations of tilted thick disks , first in the hydrodynamic limit @xcite and here in full general relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) .",
    "a general relativistic treatment ensures that all important relativistic features , such as the cusp in the potential and the einstein and lense - thirring precessions of the orbits , as well as any higher order couplings of these features , are treated properly .",
    "the inclusion of magnetic fields is important because it is now widely believed that local `` viscous '' stresses are generated by turbulence that results from the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "this work is carried out using the cosmos++ astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code @xcite . for this work ,",
    "the key features of cosmos++ are the flexible mesh structure , adaptive gridding , and three - dimensional general relativistic mhd capabilities .",
    "this simulation is carried out on a spherical - polar mesh with an equivalent resolution of @xmath0 zones . the full set up of this problem and higher",
    "resolution simulations will be described in a forthcoming paper ( fragile et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of the simulated disk at late times are the two opposing plunging streams that start from high latitudes both with respect to the black - hole symmetry plane and the disk midplane .",
    "figure [ fig : plunge ] shows the structure of the full disk and a zoomed in view of the plunging region with the plunging streams .",
    "note that one stream remains entirely above the black - hole symmetry plane , while the other remains below . as material passes through this plunging stream it undergoes strong differential precession .",
    "the precession totals approximately @xmath1 ; thus , the material enters the black hole from the opposite azimuth from which it began its plunge .",
    "orbits at the pressure maximum of the initial torus ) .",
    "this figure is oriented such that the black - hole spin axis points straight up .",
    "the @xmath2-axis of the triad gives the original orientation of the disk angular momentum vector .",
    "the main body of the disk shows very little warping or realignment toward the symmetry plane of the black hole .",
    "the plunging region ( shown in inset ) shows two opposing , high - latitude streams of material connecting the disk to the horizon ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "[ fig : plunge ] ]    the interesting question from figure [ fig : plunge ] is _ why _ do these opposing accretion streams start from such high latitude with respect to the black - hole symmetry plane and disk midplane ? fundamentally this is due to the aspherical nature of the gravitational spacetime of the rotating black hole . a nice way to illustrate",
    "this is to consider the dependence of @xmath3 , the coordinate radius of the innermost stable circular orbit , on inclination .",
    "figure [ fig : isco ] illustrates this dependence for a few selected cases of @xmath4 .",
    "the key point of the plot is that orbital stability around a rotating black hole is strongly dependent on the inclination of the orbit .",
    "notice that the unstable region increases monotonically for increasing inclination .",
    "we can make better use of the information in figure [ fig : isco ] by converting it to a polar plot and overlaying it on a plot of data from the simulation , as is done in figure [ fig : slice ] .",
    "the polar plot creates an `` isco surface '' , which gives a clear indication of where the most unstable regions are .",
    "note that the plunging orbits highlighted previously start near where the disk first encounters the isco surface .",
    "more precisely , the streams start near the largest cylindrical radius ( @xmath5 ) of the isco surface , measured with respect to the angular momentum axis of the disk .",
    "the increase in @xmath3 with inclination then explains why these plunging orbits start at high inclinations relative to the black - hole symmetry plane and the disk midplane , since this is where the gravitational potential is most unstable .",
    "this work was supported under the following nsf programs : partnerships for advanced computational infrastructure , distributed terascale facility ( dtf ) and terascale extensions : enhancements to the extensible terascale facility ."
