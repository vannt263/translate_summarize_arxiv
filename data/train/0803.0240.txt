    "nls1 galaxies are a subclass of agn with extreme emission - line and continuum properties which appear to be in part driven by their high eddington ratios , low black hole masses , and other parameters ( e.g. , osterbrock & pogge 1985 , boroson 2002 , grupe 2004 ; see komossa 2008 for a review ) .",
    "the high eddington ratios likely lead to strong , radiation - pressure driven outflows .    as a class of objects with low black hole masses , high accretion rates and strong winds , the location of nls1 galaxies on the @xmath0 plane is of special interest ( mathur et al .",

    "however , the independent question is raised as to which mechanism drives these [ oiii ] line blueshifts , and what we can learn from them regarding the nature of these systems and perhaps the evolutionary state of nls1 galaxies .",
    "that is the topic of this study .",
    "a measurable difference in blueshifts and widths of different nlr emission lines has been recognized early ( review by osterbrock 1991 ) .",
    "the phenomenon of strong [ oiii ] blueshifts exceeding one  several hundred kms@xmath1 ( so - called blue outliers ) , is more rare .",

    "the nine nls1 galaxies of the present work were drawn from the sample of xu et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) . the original sample selection and standard data reduction procedures were described in detail in that work . in brief , the sample consists of nls1 galaxies from the catalogue of vron - cetty & vron ( 2003 ) and a comparison sample of bls1 galaxies from boroson ( 2003 ) at redshift @xmath8 , which have sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr3 ( abazajian et al . 2005 ) spectra available and which have detectable low - ionization lines ( presence of [ sii]6716,6731 , with s / n@xmath95 ) . the bls1 and nls1 galaxy samples have similar redshift and absolute magnitude distributions .",
    "xu et al . ( 2007 ) corrected the sdss spectra for galactic extinction , decomposed the continuum into host galaxy and agn components , and then subtracted the host galaxy contribution and the feii complexes from the spectra .",
    "emission line profiles of the galaxies were fit with gaussians using the iraf package specfit ( kriss 1994 )",
    ". measured fwhms were corrected for instrumental broadening .",
    "re - classification after spectral emission - line fitting led to 39 bls1 and 55 nls1 galaxies in the sample .",
    "we focus here on the nine galaxies with the highest blueshifts of [ oiii ] ( tab .",
    "1 ) which were identified by komossa & xu ( 2007 ; kx07 hereafter ) .",
    "results from the complete nls1 ( and bls1 ) sample are shown for comparison purposes , and in order to identify trends across the whole bls1  nls1  blue - outlier population .",
    "when we report measurements of optical feii strength ( feii4570 ) , this is the integrated flux of the feii emission complex between the rest wavelengths 4434  and 4684 .",
    "we refer to the flux sum of the two sulphur lines , [ sii]6716 and [ sii]6731 , as [ sii]6725 .",
    "the balmer lines were decomposed into three components , narrow core ( h@xmath10 ; fwhm fixed to that determined for [ sii]6716,6731 ) , and two broad components .",
    "no physical meaning is ascribed to the two separate broad components ; they merely serve as a mathematical description ( see xu et al .",
    "2008 for alternative lorentzian fits ) .",
    "the final width of the broad - line emission , h@xmath11 , is determined as the fwhm of the sum of the two gaussians . with the exception of [ oiii ]",
    ", forbidden lines are well represented by single gauss profiles . the total [ oiii ] emission - line profile , [ oiii]@xmath12 , was decomposed into two gaussian components , a narrow core ( [ oiii]@xmath13 ) and broad base .",
    "we distinguish between two types of [ oiii ] spectral complexity : ( 1 ) the presence of such a broad base which tends to be blue - asymmetric ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1981 ) , and is referred to as `` blue wing '' , and ( 2 ) systematic blueshifts of the whole core of [ oiii ] .",
    "objects which show this latter phenomenon are called `` blue outliers '' ( zamanov et al .",
    "2002)_c}>$]150 kms@xmath1 in order to refer to an object as [ oiii ] blue outlier ; while zamanov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) use this terminology for objects with @xmath14}>$]250 kms@xmath1 , where [ oiii ] outflow velocity is measured relative to h@xmath3 . ] .",
    "measurements of the fwhm and blueshift of [ oiii ] reported in this work refer to the core of the emission - line , unless noted otherwise .    ideally , measurements of the velocity shift of [ oiii ] should be done relative to the galaxy restframe , as defined by stellar absorption lines from the host galaxy . however , these features are generally weak or absent in our galaxies ( and in nls1 galaxies in general ) .",
    "we therefore measure velocity shifts of [ oiii ] and of all other lines relative to [ sii ] .",
    "we use positive velocity values to refer to blueshifts , negative ones for redshift .",
    "the shifts of h@xmath3 and other low - ionization lines ( [ oi]6300 , nii[6584 ] , [ oii]3727 ) agree well with [ sii ] , while other high - ionization lines ( [ neiii]3861 , [ nev]3426 , and iron coronal lines ) are characterized by high blueshifts ( sect .",
    "if lines were too faint to be fit by a gaussian of free width , we used fixed width instead ( fixed to fwhm([sii ] ) for low - ionization lines or to fwhm([oiii]@xmath13 ) for high - ionization lines ) and determined the central wavelength to measure the blueshift .",
    "results are reported in tab .",
    "1 . since the redshifts provided by the sdss pipeline are determined based on all strong detected emission lines and are therefore influenced by the blueshifted [ oiii ] , we have re - measured redshifts based on h@xmath10 .",
    "it is these redshifts that are given in tab .",
    "we have measured the average [ oiii]@xmath12/[sii]6725 ratios of our bls1 and nls1 galaxy sample .",
    "we find that , in terms of this ratio , their nlrs are similar , with @xmath4[oiii]@xmath12/[sii]6725@xmath9=5 in bls1 galaxies , and @xmath4[oiii]@xmath12/[sii]6725@xmath9=4 in nls1 galaxies .",

    "here , we briefly comment on the detection of [ fex]6375 in two blue outliers . in pg1244 + 026 [ fex ]",
    "is blended with [ oi]6365 . for decomposition , the width of [ oi]6365 was fixed to that of [ oi]6300 .",
    "the two - component fit then reproduces the expected ratio of [ oi]6300/[oi]6365 @xmath15 3 .",
    "[ fex ] is blueshifted by 640 kms@xmath1 . in rxj0135@xmath160043 , [ fex ]",
    "overlaps with atmospheric o@xmath17 which is imperfectly corrected for .",
    "therefore , the width of [ fex ] was fixed to that of [ oiii ] .",
    "this gives an outflow velocity of 990 kms@xmath1 .      in order to see",
    "how much the fitting procedure affects measurements of [ oiii ] fluxes , asymmetries and blueshifts , we have repeated the spectral analysis several times under different conditions and assumptions : we have fit the host - galaxy - corrected , feii subtracted spectrum and for comparison the original sdss spectrum without any of these corrections .",
    "we have re - fit the [ oiii ] profile in a number of different ways , and with different gaussian decompositions .",
    "the [ oiii ] profile was fit using the red half of the profile only , or different fractions of the total profile , or only the upper 30% of the profile , or with a single and a double gaussian profile .",
    "fitting the profile with one single gaussian component maximizes the blueshift in objects with significant [ oiii ] blue wings . in all other cases , uncertainties in line blueshifts due to non - subtraction of a host galaxy contribution and due to different line fitting procedures",
    "are typically much less than 50 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the blueshift independently determined from the weaker line [ oiii]4959 also agrees with [ oiii]5007 within better than 50 kms@xmath1 .",
    "four of our galaxies are also in the sample of boroson ( 2005 ) .",
    "his [ oiii ] blueshift measurements agree with ours within typically better than @xmath1810 kms@xmath1 .",
    "uncertainties in fwhm of the core of [ oiii ] are typically 30% for [ oiii ] lines with extra blue wing ( smaller in others ) , and are due to uncertainties in decomposition .",
    "we note in passing that the frequency of [ oiii ] blue wings in blue outliers is neither particularly high nor low ( see also boroson 2005 ) .",
    "in order to facilitate a systematic discussion of nlr models of blue outliers ( sect . 4.3 ) , we have investigated whether the non - shifted low - ionization lines have a ( faint ) high - ionization [ oiii ] counterpart and vice versa , other high - ionization lines show blueshifts , too ( sect .",
    "3.3.1 ) , but they are too faint for multi - component line decompositions . among the non - shifted emission lines , [ sii ]",
    "is the strongest unblended line , and we therefore focus on [ sii ] for the corresponding estimates in this section . ] .",
    "we did this representatively for the three galaxies with the highest [ oiii ] blueshifts ( sbs0919 + 515 , sdssj11555 + 0107 and rxj01354@xmath160043 ) , and for the galaxy with the highest s / n ( pg1244 + 026 ) .",
    "we have examined the following three questions :    \\(1 ) is there any [ oiii ] emission at zero blueshift present in the spectrum ( which could originate from the inner nlr ; or be counterpart to the low - ionization emission lines from the outer nlr ) ? in order to test this , we have enforced an extra gaussian line contribution to [ oiii ] at zero blueshift ( or at @xmath19 } = 50 $ ] kms@xmath1 , the average value of our nls1 sample excluding blue outliers ) and of fixed fwhm([oiii]@xmath20)=fwhm([sii ] ) .",
    "we find that , if present , it must be very weak .",
    "the average ratio [ oiii]@xmath12/[sii]6725 in our bls1 sample is 5 , while in our nls1 sample it is 4 .",
    "this value of 4 is much higher than the upper limit on the extra component which was fit to the observed spectra : typically , [ oiii]@xmath20/[sii]6725 @xmath21 , and always , [ oiii]@xmath20/[sii]6725 @xmath22 .",
    "since the ratio of [ oiii]/[sii ] of nearby seyfert galaxies generally decreases in dependence of radius ( in models and observations ; komossa & schulz 1997 , bennert et al . 2006 ) and since there must be an [ oiii ] contribution from the outer [ sii ] emitting clouds , the limits derived on any non - blueshifted [ oiii ] contribution from the _ inner _ nlr are very tight .",
    "\\(2 ) does the blueshifted [ oiii ] have a blueshifted h@xmath3 counterpart ?",
    "i.e. , how much highly blueshifted h@xmath3 could be ` hidden ' in the h@xmath3 profile ? in order to check this , we have re - fit h@xmath3 adding an additional gaussian to describe its profile with parameters of this extra component fixed at @xmath23_c}$ ] , fwhm(h@xmath24)=fwhm([oiii]@xmath13 ) and an intensity ratio [ oiii]@xmath13/h@xmath24=10 .",
    "we find that such a weak component could generally be hidden in the h@xmath3 profile .",
    "\\(3 ) does the blueshifted [ oiii ] have a blueshifted low - ionization counterpart in [ sii ] ?",
    "this is not the case . for typical",
    "_ spatially averaged _ ratios of [ oiii]/[sii]6725 @xmath154 of our nls1 sample , blueshifted [ sii ] lines would have generally been detectable , but are absent .",
    "very faint blueshifted [ sii ] , as it may arise in the _ inner _ nlr , can not be excluded with the present data .",
    "in summary , we find ( 1 ) little evidence for zero - blueshift [ oiii ] emission ( the amount of emission consistent with the spectra likely originates from the outer parts of the nlr which also emits in [ sii ] and other low - ionization lines ) ; ( 2 ) an extra blueshifted component in h@xmath3  the expected counterpart to blueshifted [ oiii] can be hidden in the h@xmath3 profile ; and ( 3 ) there is no detectable highly blueshifted component in the low - ionization lines .",

    "typical errors in individual bh mass estimates can be as large as 0.5 dex , and arise from the use of single - epoch data , and uncertainties in h@xmath3 decomposition and in host galaxy contribution .",
    "the nlr density was derived from the density - sensitive [ sii ] intensity ratio , [ sii]6716/[sii]6731 ( xu et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we have checked for ( 1 ) trends of outflow velocity with other ( atomic ) parameters within each single spectrum , and ( 2 ) for trends across our sample of blue outliers ( do all blue outliers have high eddington ratios , high black hole masses , etc . ? ) , and ( 3 ) for trends across our whole sample of bls1 and nls1 galaxies .",
    "we detect a strong correlation between emission - line blueshift and ionization potential ( fig .",
    "[ ionpot ] ) .",
    "while the low - ionization forbidden lines of [ oi ] , [ oii ] and [ nii ] , and the balmer lines h@xmath33 and h@xmath3 are at velocities very similar to [ sii ] , high - ionization lines on the other hand show strong blueshifts which increase with ionization potential .",
    "two galaxies ( sdssj115533.50 + 010730.4 and pg1244 + 026 ) show extreme blueshifts in [ fe x ] , on the order of 600 - 1000 kms@xmath1 .",
    "there is also a correlation between outflow velocity and critical density of the individual line transitions ( fig .",

    "<S> we have studied the properties of seyfert galaxies with high [ oiii]5007 blueshifts ( `` blue outliers '' ) , originally identified because of their strong deviation from the @xmath0 relation of normal , narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) and broad - line seyfert 1 ( bls1 ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these blue outliers turn out to be important test - beds for models of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , for mechanisms of driving large - scale outflows , for links between nls1 galaxies and radio galaxies , and for orientation - dependent nls1 models . </S>",
    "<S> we report the detection of a strong correlation of line blueshift with ionization potential in each galaxy , including the measurement of coronal lines with radial velocities up to 5001000 kms@xmath1 , and we confirm a strong correlation between [ oiii ] blueshift and line width . </S>",
    "<S> all [ oiii ] blue outliers have narrow widths of their broad balmer lines and high eddington ratios . while the presence of non - shifted low - ionization lines signifies the presence of a classical outer quiescent nlr in blue outliers </S>",
    "<S> , we also report the absence of any second , non - blueshifted [ oiii ] component from a classical inner nlr . </S>",
    "<S> these results place tight constraints on nlr models . </S>",
    "<S> we favor a scenario in which the nlr clouds are entrained in a decelerating wind which explains the strong stratification and the absence of a zero - blueshift inner nlr of blue outliers . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the wind remains speculative at this time ( collimated radio plasma , thermal winds , radiatively accelerated clouds ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps linked to the high eddington ratios of blue outliers . </S>",
    "<S> similar , less powerful winds could be present in all seyfert galaxies , but would generally only affect the coronal line region ( clr ) , or level off even before reaching the clr . </S>",
    "<S> similarities between blue outliers in nls1 galaxies and ( compact ) radio sources are briefly discussed . </S>"
