    "the primary cosmic rays consisting of protons , alpha particles and heavier nuclei continuously bombard the earth with a rate of 1000 particles / m@xmath4 sec at the top of the earth atmosphere @xcite .",
    "most of the cosmic rays originate in galactic sources such as neutron stars , pulsars , supernovae , active galactic nuclei and the big bang .",
    "the relative abundance of nuclei with charge number @xmath5 in cosmic rays is similar to that in the intersteller medium which indicates that cosmic rays are the normal intersteller matter in astrophysical process .",
    "the majority of cosmic rays from a few gev to 100 tev are accelerated in supernova blast .",
    "the magnetic field of the sun tends to exclude lower energy particles ( e@xmath6 gev ) . during periods of low solar activity , more cosmic rays",
    "manage to reach earth .",
    "earth s magnetic field also tends to exclude lower energy particles .",
    "the particles have greater difficulty penetrating the earth s magnetic field near equator than the poles .",
    "thus , the intensity of cosmic rays depends both on the location and the time .    upon entering the atmosphere ,",
    "the primary cosmic radiations interact with the air molecules ( mainly oxygen and nitrogen nuclei ) mostly at 10 - 15 km above the sea level  @xcite .",
    "all particles suffer energy losses through hadronic and/or electromagnetic processes .",
    "the most abundant particles emerging from the energetic hadronic collisions are pions .",
    "particles such as kaons , hyperons , charmed particles and nucleon - antinucleon pairs are also produced . however , most of these particles are unstable and either decay to other lighter particles or interact further with the air nuclei .",
    "the charged pions and kaons decay to muons and neutrinos as shown below    @xmath7 @xmath8    @xmath9 @xmath10    for a given particle propagating in the atmosphere , the probabilities of decay and interaction become a function of energy , altitude and zenith angle .",
    "the atmospheric length increases from vertical to inclined direction and this means more energy loss of the particles which results in a smaller integrated muon flux at the surface of the earth .",
    "the pion decay probability is also larger in the inclined direction which will enhance the muon flux in the intermediate energy .",
    "as the energy increases , the fraction of muons from kaon decays also increases because the longer - lived pions become more likely to interact before decaying than the shorter - lived kaons . since muons are produced with @xmath11(@xmath12 )",
    ", the measurement of muons near the maximum intensity curve for the parent pions can be used to calibrate the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "numerical calculations are needed to account accurately for decay and energy loss processes along with the knowledge of primary cosmic spectrum and the energy dependencies of their interaction cross - sections @xcite .",
    "one of the goal of this paper is to obtain simple analytical expressions which can be readily used as input in the simulations of detectors for cosmic rays as well as for rare event searches .    in this work",
    ", a modified power law is assumed for the cosmic ( atmospheric ) muon energy distribution at earth . using this function and geometrical considerations",
    ", we obtain analytical form for zenith angle distribution . for a flat earth",
    ", it leads to @xmath1 form where @xmath2 is the same as the power of energy distribution .",
    "further , a new analytical form for zenith angle distribution is obtained without assuming a flat earth .",
    "the parameters of these distributions are obtained with the help of measured energy and angular distributions of atmospheric muons .",
    "muons are produced at about 10 - 15 km height in the atmosphere and lose about 2 gev of energy before reaching the ground .",
    "their energy and angular distribution at ground reflect a convolution of production spectrum , energy loss in the atmosphere and the decay .",
    "the energy spectrum of muons is almost flat below 1 gev and then steepens to reflect the primary energy spectrum in the 10 - 100 gev range .",
    "it steepens further above 100 gev since the pions above this energy would interact in the atmosphere before decaying to muons . above 1 tev ,",
    "the energy spectrum of the muons is one power steeper than the primary spectrum .",
    "the energy distribution of primary cosmic rays follow power law @xmath13 .",
    "the pion and the muon distributions also follow the same power law which is modified in the low energy region . the vertical flux as a function of energy can be described by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vertical ( @xmath16 ) muon flux integrated over energy , which gives the normalization @xmath17 . here",
    ", we have added a parameter @xmath18 which accounts for energy loss due to both the hadronic as well as electromagnetic interactions with air molecules .",
    "we can introduce one more parameter @xmath19 which modifies the power in the high energy part and that should account for the finite life time of pions and kaons @xmath20 both the eqs .",
    "[ flux ] and [ flux1 ] assume that the energy loss ( @xmath21 ) is independent of particle energy , an assumption which is good for minimum ionizing particles .",
    "at low energies , the energy loss varies as @xmath22 thus a more appropriate distribution would come with an additional parameter @xmath23 as @xmath24 here , the normalization constant @xmath25 can be obtained numerically .",

    "the muon flux measured on the earth s surface has a weak dependence on the azimuthal angle but depends strongly on zenith angle which is defined as the angle made by the incident ray with the vertical direction at that point .",
    "one can obtain inclined distance @xmath26 in terms of vertical distance @xmath27 , the zenith angle @xmath0 and the earth s radius @xmath28 using a simple geometrical picture given in fig.[rbd ] . using sine law for @xmath29 @xmath30",
    "the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath0 is @xmath32 and the pathlength @xmath26 in the inclined direction is @xmath33 using eq .",
    "[ ratio2 ] and [ ratio4 ] , the ratio of pathlengths of a muon from inclined direction to that of a muon from the vertical direction is obtained as @xmath34 the ratio of the integrated muon flux at @xmath0 with that at @xmath35 can be obtained from eq .",

    "[ flux1 ] can also be considered the same as above since the higher energy term depending on @xmath19 will make a little difference to the integrated flux .",
    "the ratio of the energy loss from inclined to the vertical direction is given by the ratio of the pathlengths ( same as the ratio of thicknesses ) @xmath38 in the respective directions and thus , the zenith angle distribution of energy integrated flux in terms of @xmath39 is obtained as @xmath40 the overall distribution function as a function of both the energy and the zenith angle then can be written as @xmath41 here , the function @xmath38 is given by eq  [ dtheta ] . if the earth is assumed to be flat then @xmath42 which on putting in eq .",
