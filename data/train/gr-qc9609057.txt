    "to define quasilocal energy in general relativity , one can begin with a suitable action functional for the time history @xmath3 of a spatially bounded system @xmath1 . here",
    "`` suitable '' means that in the associated variational principle the induced metric on the time history @xmath4 of the system boundary @xmath5 is fixed . in particular",
    ", this means that the lapse of proper time between the boundaries of the initial and final states of the system @xmath1 must be fixed as boundary data .",
    "the quasilocal energy ( qle ) is then defined as minus the rate of change of the classical action ( or hamilton - jacobi principal function ) corresponding to a unit increase in proper time.@xcite so defined , the qle is a functional on the gravitational phase space of @xmath1 , and is the value of the gravitational hamiltonian corresponding to unit lapse function and zero shift vector on the system boundary @xmath6 .",
    "although other definitions of quasilocal energy have been proposed ( see , for example , the references listed in @xcite ) , the qle considered here has the key property , which we consider crucial , that it plays the role of internal energy in the thermodynamical description of coupled gravitational and matter fields.@xcite    in this paper we define the energy of a perfectly isolated system at a given retarded time as the suitable limit of the quasilocal energy @xmath0 for the partial system enclosed within a finite topologically spherical boundary . for our choice of asymptotic reference frame",
    "the energy that we compute equals what is usually called the bondi - sachs mass.@xcite as we shall see , our asymptotic reference frame defines precisely that infinitesimal generator of the bondi - metzner - sachs ( bms ) group corresponding to a pure time translation.@xcite we also show that in the same null limit the lapse - arbitrary , shift - zero hamiltonian boundary value defines a physically meaningful element in the space dual to supertranslations",
    ". this dual space element , it turns out , coincides with the  supermomentum \" discussed by geroch.@xcite our results are then specialized to an expression for the full bondi - sachs four - momentum in terms of hamiltonian values .",
    "it is already known that when @xmath6 is the two - sphere at spacelike infinity , the quasilocal and arnowitt - deser - misner@xcite notions of energy - momentum agree.@xcite our results therefore indicate that the quasilocal formalism provides a unified hamiltonian framework for describing the standard notions of gravitational energy - momentum in asymptopia .    before turning to the technical details ,",
    "let us first present a short overview of our approach . consider a spacetime @xmath3 which is asymptotically flat at future null infinity @xmath7 and a system @xmath8 of bondi coordinates thereon.@xcite the retarded time @xmath9 labels a one - parameter family of outgoing null hypersurfaces @xmath10 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath11 is a luminosity parameter ( areal radius ) along the outgoing null - geodesic generators of the hypersurfaces @xmath10 .",
    "the bondi coordinate system also defines a two - parameter family of topologically spherical two - surfaces @xmath12 .",
    "it suits our purposes to consider only a single null hypersurface of the family @xmath10 , say @xmath13 , the one determined by setting @xmath9 equal to an _ arbitrary _ constant @xmath14 .",
    "the collection @xmath15 of two - surfaces foliates @xmath13 , and in the @xmath16 limit these two - surfaces converge on an infinite - radius _ round _ sphere @xmath17 . to streamline the presentation",
    ", we refer to our generic null hypersurface simply as @xmath18 ; and we use the plain letter @xmath6 to denote both the @xmath18-foliating collection @xmath15 and a single generic two - surface of this collection .",
    "now , should we desire a more general @xmath19-foliating collection of two - surfaces , we could , of course , introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath20 . for a fixed retarded time",
    "@xmath21 the new two - surfaces would then arise as level surfaces of constant @xmath20 .",
    "however , we shall not consider such a new radial coordinate , because the new two - surfaces would not necessarily converge towards a round sphere in the asymptotic limit . at any rate",
    ", we could handle such an additional kinematical freedom , were it present , by assuming that along each outgoing null ray @xmath20 approached @xmath11 at a sufficiently fast rate in the asymptotic limit .",
    "our first goal is to compute the qle within a two - surface @xmath6 in the limit as @xmath6 approaches a spherical cut of @xmath7 along the null surface @xmath18 , and to show that this result coincides with the bondi - sachs mass : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the quasilocal energy surface density with @xmath24 ( in geometrical units ) and @xmath25 is the determinant of the induced metric on @xmath6 .",
    "recall that @xmath26 denotes the mean curvature of @xmath6 as embedded in some _ spacelike _ spanning three - surface @xmath1 .",
    "since both @xmath6 and @xmath1 are embedded in the _ physical _ spacetime @xmath3 , we sometimes use the notation @xmath27 .",
    "also recall that @xmath28 denotes the mean curvature of a surface which is isometric to @xmath6 but which is embedded in a three - dimensional _ reference _ space different than @xmath1 . here",
    "we choose the reference space to be flat euclidean space @xmath29 , i.  e.   we assign a flat three - slice of minkowski spacetime the zero value of energy.@xcite although a definition of the zero - energy reference in terms of flat space is neither always essential nor appropriate@xcite , it is the correct choice for the analysis of this paper .    in order to define @xmath26 , we must select such a three - surface spanning @xmath6 for each @xmath11 value .",

    "thus , the continuation of @xmath1 away from @xmath6 is not needed ; moreover , such a continuation of @xmath1 might not be defined throughout the interior of @xmath3 . therefore , though we speak of choosing a @xmath1 three - surface to span @xmath6 for each @xmath11 value , we are really fixing only a timelike unit normal vector field at @xmath6 . ) for generality , we leave the choice of spanning three - surface @xmath1 essentially arbitrary at each @xmath11 value , but we do enforce a definite choice asymptotically .",
    "heuristically , as @xmath31 the @xmath1 three - surface spanning @xmath6 approaches an asymptotic three - surface @xmath32 which spans a round infinite - radius spherical cut of @xmath7 ( see the figure ) .",
    "our construction is , as expected , sensitive to the choice of asymptotic three - surface @xmath32 .",
    "said another way , the qle depends on the fleet of observers at @xmath6 whose four - velocities are orthogonal to the spanning three - surface at @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , one expects _ a priori _ the expression on the right - hand side of ( [ limit ] ) to depend on the choice of asymptotic fleet associated with the two - sphere at @xmath7 .",
    "the asymptotic fleet we choose corresponds to a pure bms time translation : each member of the asymptotic fleet rides along @xmath33 . note that",
    ", although @xmath33 is everywhere timelike in @xmath3 ( at least in the relevant exterior regions ) , the _ extension _ of @xmath33 to @xmath7 in a conformal completion @xmath34 of the physical spacetime @xmath3 is in fact a null vector which lies in @xmath7 .",
    "( while we occasionally find it clarifying to make reference to the concept of a conformal completion , we do not explicitly use conformal completions in this paper . )",

    "both vector fields point everywhere normal to our collection @xmath12 of two - surfaces , and @xmath38 .",
    "next , we construct on @xmath19 a timelike vector field @xmath39 ( equality restricted to @xmath19 ) , which in our analysis will _ define _ for each @xmath6 along @xmath18 a spacelike spanning three - surface @xmath1 . in @xmath40ii",
    "we use the @xmath1 three - surfaces determined by @xmath41 to define an unreferenced energy surface density @xmath27 for each @xmath6 slice of @xmath18 and then examine the asymptotic limit of @xmath42 . in @xmath40iii we consider the asymptotic expression for the flat - space reference density @xmath43 , but give the derivation of this expression in the appendix .",

    "our construction implies @xmath70 on each ray as @xmath31 .",
    "now , the standard realization of the bms - group lie algebra ( as vector fields on future null infinity ) identifies the _ extension _ of @xmath33 to @xmath7 ( in a conformal completion @xmath34 of @xmath3 ) with a pure time translation.@xcite therefore , asymptotically , our fiducial surface @xmath32 determines precisely the pure time - translation generator of the bms group .",

    "therefore , we may assume that @xmath81 while calculating the spin coefficients in ( [ spin ] ) and then simply multiply the @xmath81 results by the appropriate factor to get the correct general expressions .",
    "let us sketch the calculation .",
    "first , from ( [ bassae]a ) with @xmath81 note that @xmath86 , because @xmath87 is a gradient .",
    "next , using both expressions ( [ bassae ] ) with @xmath81 , one can work the second term inside the parenthesis of ( [ spin]a ) into the form @xmath88 .",
    "finally , one writes the covariant - divergence terms as ordinary divergences ; for example , @xmath89 , where the square root of ( minus ) the determinant of the spacetime metric is @xmath90 .    following these steps and multiplying by the appropriate boost factors at the end of the calculation , one finds @xmath91 here the over - dot denotes partial differentiation by @xmath33 , the prime denotes partial differentiation by @xmath92 , and @xmath93 denotes the @xmath6 covariant derivative . since @xmath11 is an areal radius , we may take @xmath94 [ see the form of the @xmath6 metric given in ( [ bmetric ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , we obtain the compact expressions @xmath95 adding twice ( [ mu2]a ) to ( [ mu2]b ) , we arrive at our desired expression @xmath96 which has the asymptotic form @xmath97 note that we have chosen not to expand the @xmath98 pure divergence term @xmath99 .",
    "our assumption about the fall - off of @xmath61 ensures that a term @xmath100 which appears in the asymptotic expression for @xmath26 can be swept into @xmath101 .",

    "we have made an appeal to stokes theorem to show that the `` dangerous '' @xmath109 term that arises from proper integration over the pure - divergence term @xmath110 in ( [ kexpansion ] ) does indeed vanish .",
    "hence , this term does not contribute to the bondi - sachs mass and does not spoil the result ( [ unreferencede2 ] ) .",
    "the reference point contribution to the energy is @xmath111 where the asymptotic expression for @xmath28 must be determined from the specific asymptotic form ( [ bmetric ] ) of the sachs two - metric .",
    "we present this calculation in the appendix .",
    "the result is @xmath112 note the absence of an @xmath109 term in @xmath113 .",
    "the result ( 3.5 ) has just the right form , in that it removes the part of @xmath103 which becomes singular as @xmath31 but does not itself contribute to the mass .",
    "therefore the total quasilocal energy for large @xmath11 is @xmath114 this is the energy of the gravitational and matter fields associated with the spacelike three - surface @xmath1 which spans a @xmath6 slice of @xmath18 and which tends toward @xmath32 .",
    "our main claim ( [ limit ] ) follows immediately from ( 3.6 ) .",
    "consider the expression @xmath115 for the on - shell value of the gravitational hamiltonian appropriate for a spatially bounded three - manifold @xmath1 , subject to the choice of a vanishing shift vector at the boundary @xmath116 : @xmath117 we refer to @xmath118 as the smeared energy surface density .",
    "addition of this boundary term to the smeared hamiltonian constraint ensures that as a whole the sum is functionally differentiable.@xcite in this section we consider the @xmath16 limit of @xmath118 along the null hypersurface @xmath18 in exactly the same fashion as we considered the limit ( 1.1 ) of the quasilocal energy previously . before evaluating @xmath119 ,",
    "let us discuss its physical significance .",
    "consider a particular spherical cut @xmath17 of @xmath7 .",
    "a general bms supertranslation pushes @xmath17 forward in retarded time @xmath9 in a general angle - dependent fashion . as is well - known",
    ", the infinitesimal generator corresponding to such a supertranslation has the form @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is any twice differentiable function of the angular coordinates.@xcite as we have seen , @xmath33 is heuristically the hypersurface normal @xmath41 at @xmath17 of an asymptotic spanning three - surface @xmath32 . in other words , each member of the fleet of observers at @xmath17 rides along @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , again heuristically , the on - shell value of the hamiltonian generator of a general bms supertranslation is @xmath122 this symbolic expression coincides with the @xmath16 limit of the smeared energy surface density ( 4.1 ) , where we set @xmath123 ( suitable fall - off behavior for @xmath124 is assumed ) .",
    "thus , @xmath119 defines a physically meaningful element in the dual space of general supertranslations . in this respect",
    "it is like the  supermomentum \" of geroch.@xcite in the next section we show explicitly that , in fact , @xmath125 is precisely geroch s  supermomentum . \"",
    "note , however , that it might be better to call such an expression the `` superenergy , '' as it arises entirely from the `` energy sector '' of the hamiltonian s boundary term ( that is , the sector with vanishing shift vector ) but also incorporates the `` many - fingered '' nature of time ( that is , an arbitrary lapse function ) .",
    "let us now evaluate the @xmath16 limit of the smeared energy surface density @xmath118 . as we have stated , there is no @xmath109 contribution to @xmath113 .",
    "the absence of this contribution stems from the fact that the two - sphere average of the coefficient @xmath126 of the @xmath98 piece of the reference term @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "as spelled out in the appendix , this fact follows directly from an equation governing the required isometric embedding of @xmath6 into euclidean three - space .",
    "moreover , as seen in section 2 , the coefficient @xmath127 of the @xmath98 piece of the physical @xmath26 is not solely twice the mass aspect but also contains a unit - sphere divergence term .",
    "now , in the present case @xmath23 is smeared against a function @xmath124 , so one might worry that the limit is spoiled in some way by the presence of the smearing function . however , as we now show , _ for solutions of the field equations _ , the _ unintegrated _ expression @xmath128 is precisely the mass aspect of the system in the @xmath31 limit .",
    "this striking result rests on an exact cancellation between @xmath126 and the aforementioned unit - sphere divergence part of @xmath129 .    with the machinery set up in the previous sections and the appendix",

    "inspection of ( [ sachs]c , d ) shows that @xmath135 is expressed in terms of the same functions , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , that appear in the @xmath57 piece of @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , a short calculation with the @xmath6 metric shows that for these solutions @xmath139 may be expressed in terms of @xmath133 as follows : @xmath140 therefore , the term in ( [ limk - k0 ] ) which is enclosed by square brackets vanishes , and we obtain @xmath141 for the desired limit .",
    "this result shows that the @xmath16 limit of the smeared energy surface density equals the smeared mass aspect .",
    "coupled with the findings of the next section , it follows that geroch s  supermomentum \" is just the smeared mass aspect .",
    "this simple result does not appear to be widely known .    finally , recall that the bondi - sachs four - momentum components @xmath142 correspond asymptotically to a pure translation . in terms of the smeared energy surface density ,",

    "in this appendix we prove that the subtraction - term contribution @xmath193 to the quasilocal energy obeys @xmath194 for large @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we derive the result @xmath195 relating the coefficient @xmath196 of the @xmath98 piece of the reference term @xmath28 and the coefficient @xmath131 of the @xmath132 piece of the @xmath6 ricci scalar @xmath197 .",
    "the @xmath193 term is constructed as follows .",

    "let @xmath198 represent the extrinsic curvature of @xmath6 as isometrically embedded in @xmath29 .",
    "the flat - space reference density is @xmath199 , and in terms of this density @xmath200 since it is the intrinsic geometry of @xmath6 which determines the reference term @xmath28 , let us first collect a few results concerning this geometry",
    ". in the bondi coordinate system the two - metric of @xmath6 takes the following form:@xcite @xmath201 in terms of the functions @xmath136 and @xmath137 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 have the expansions [ see ( [ sachs]d ) ] @xmath204 as mentioned , we do not necessarily enforce sachs `` outgoing radiation condition '' which would , in fact , imply that in the expansions for @xmath202 and @xmath203 the terms that appear after the leading @xmath57 terms are @xmath132.@xcite    from the form of the line element ( [ bmetric ] ) one easily verifies ( [ sachs]d ) and that @xmath105 . a bit more work establishes that the scalar curvature @xmath197 of @xmath6 has the asymptotic form @xmath205 where @xmath206 .",
    "we have given the explicit form ( [ calr = dw ] ) of the coefficient @xmath207 corresponding to the asymptotic solutions considered here , and we have found this coefficient to be a pure divergence on the unit sphere . that this term integrates to zero can also be shown _ via _ the argument to follow , which does not assume that the einstein equations hold .",
    "the two - sphere average of @xmath139 vanishes , _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath208 . to prove the lemma ,",
    "start with the gauss - bonnet theorem @xcite @xmath209 in the second line we have simply expanded @xmath210 and used @xmath105 . on the right side of the equation , integration over the first term inside the brackets gives @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , we arrive at @xmath212 since @xmath213 falls off _ faster _ than @xmath132 , the @xmath214 limit of this last equation proves the lemma .",
    "now let us discern the @xmath11 dependence of the reference term @xmath28 .",
    "we must first address the issue of whether or not @xmath6 may be isometrically embedded in @xmath29 in a suitably unique way .",
    "it is known that a riemannian manifold possessing two - sphere topology and everywhere positive scalar curvature can be globally immersed in @xmath29 .",
    "an immersion differs from an embedding by allowing for self - intersection of the surface ( seemingly allowable provided that @xmath28 remains well defined ) . the cohn - vossen theorem states that any compact two - surface contained in @xmath29 whose curvature is everywhere positive is unwarpable .",
    "unwarpable means that the surface is uniquely determined by its two - metric , up to translations or rotations in @xmath29 ( which of course do not affect @xmath215).@xcite our surface @xmath6 has two - sphere topology , and for @xmath11 sufficiently large the scalar curvature @xmath210 is everywhere positive .",
    "it thus follows that for suitably large @xmath11 , the reference term @xmath28 is well defined .",
    "the key equation for determining the form of @xmath28 is the standard gauss - codazzi relation:@xcite @xmath216 this equation ( essentially a two - dimensional version of the hamiltonian constraint ) is an integrability criterion , obeyed by our embedding , which relates certain components of the _ vanishing _ riemann tensor of @xmath29 to the intrinsic @xmath6 curvature scalar and the desired reference extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath198 .",
    "next , since @xmath6 approaches a perfectly round sphere as @xmath31 , we take the following expansions for the various pieces of @xmath217 as an ansatz : @xmath218 to avoid clutter , for the various remainder terms we have used in ( [ expand ] ) simply a subscript @xmath219 in place of what should be @xmath220 , _",
    "etc_. plugging the expansions ( [ curvexpand ] ) and ( [ expand ] ) into ( [ key ] ) , one finds that to lowest order , namely @xmath98 , the equation is identically satisfied . at the next order , namely @xmath132 , the equation ( [ key ] ) yields the result ( a2 ) .",
    "therefore , we have found the following asymptotic expansion for @xmath28 : @xmath221 the first lemma we proved above has an important consequence .",
    "it ensures that the `` dangerous '' @xmath109 term in the integral ( [ integral ] ) vanishes ( regardless of whether or not ( [ calr = dw ] ) holds , which requires that the einstein equations are satisfied asymptotically ) . hence we get the result ( [ mainresult ] ) .",
