    "the impressive experimental progress in the field of ultracold atoms in the last decade has brought it to the forefront of research on strongly correlated quantum many - body systems .",
    "the possibility to confine and manipulate atoms in optical lattices created by standing waves of laser light gives the opportunity to realize some of the model hamiltonians of condensed matter physics , and in this way shed light on notoriously difficult problems @xcite .",
    "going beyond that , also systems without clear analogue in condensed matter systems can be realized .",
    "a prime example of this is the possibility to study bosonic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "these systems allow for the experimental check of theoretical predictions on the bose - hubbard model , introduced by fisher et al .",
    "@xcite in the late eighties .",
    "recent experiments with high accuracy verified the superfluid - mott insulator phase transition@xcite .",
    "these experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the bose - hubbard model@xcite .",
    "cold atomic gases also offer the possibility to realize mixtures of fermions and bosons @xcite .",
    "this yields a very rich system , which at this moment is far from fully explored .",
    "one promising route that is currently experimentally investigated is to make heteronuclear molecules consisting of a boson and a fermion , with a permanent electrical dipole moment and hence a long range interaction @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will , however , concentrate on the many - body behavior of an interacting cloud of spinless fermions and bosons .",
    "this system bears some analogy with the well - known two - component fermi - fermi mixture , but is in fact much richer . by replacing one of the fermionic components by bosons ,",
    "one keeps the instability of half - filled fermions towards charge - density wave ( cdw ) ordering . for historical reasons we keep this terminology throughout this paper ,",
    "although the fermionic atoms under consideration do not carry a charge . at the same time the bosonic species can be superfluid , allowing for supersolid behavior , where diagonal cdw order coexists with off - diagonal superfluid long - range order .",
    "several previous theoretical works have studied mixtures of fermions and bosons in an optical lattice@xcite . in some of these@xcite supersolid phases were predicted .",
    "investigating a strongly correlated bose - fermi mixture in an optical lattice is a difficult problem , to which powerful numerical and analytical techniques have been applied . in one dimension",
    "this involved bosonization@xcite , density matrix renormalization group@xcite , and quantum monte carlo@xcite . in higher dimensions , however , non - perturbative calculations are sparse . in two dimensions renormalization group studies",
    "@xcite have been carried out .",
    "although able to describe non - perturbative effects , this technique is limited to weak couplings .",
    "another powerful technique that has been applied in two@xcite , and recently also three dimensions@xcite is to integrate out the fermions . in this way",
    "one generates a long - ranged , retarded interaction between the bosons , which means that the resulting bosonic problem is still hard to solve .",
    "important progress has recently been made in mapping out the mott - insulating lobes .",
    "a composite fermion approach@xcite was used to qualitatively describe possible quantum phases of the bose - fermi mixture .    in this paper",
    "we describe the recently introduced generalized dynamical mean - field theory ( gdmft ) @xcite to study this system .",
    "this is a non - perturbative method which becomes exact in infinite dimensions and is a good approximation for three spatial dimensions .",
    "the only small parameter is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coordination number .",
    "for this reason , the method reliably describes the full range from weak to strong coupling . to solve the effective self - consistent quantum impurity problem arising within gdmft",
    ", we use the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite .",
    "nrg resolves the low - frequency information very well , which enables us to reliably capture the supersolid phase , which in general has a small gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will shortly describe the hamiltonian of the system and afterwards in section [ method ] we consider gdmft in detail . in sec .",

    "[ summary ] we end up with concluding remarks . in appendix [ derivation_effetive_action ]",
    "we derive the effective action , while in appendix [ derivation_kinetic_energy ] and appendix [ derivation_self_energy ] we derive the expression for the kinetic energy and self - energy , respectively .",
    "the standing waves of an optical lattice produce a potential @xmath4 , with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the wavelength of the laser . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the optical lattice to be strong enough that we can restrict ourselves to the lowest band .",
    "this means that we require @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the recoil energy for bosons ( fermions ) . in order for the single band approximation to hold",
    ", all the other energy scales and temperatures should be smaller than the band gap .",
    "since the wannier functions for the fermions and the bosons are well localized , it is a good approximation to consider only local interactions between particles and next - neighbor hopping , i.e. , to consider the system in a tight - binding approximation . under these approximations",
    "a mixture of fermions and bosons in an optical lattice can be well described by the single - band fermi - bose hubbard model @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes summation over nearest neighbors .",

    "[ j_exp]-[u_fb_exp ] it is clear that the ratio of the interaction to the tunneling amplitude can be varied from weak to strong coupling .    in the case of spinless fermions , since there is only one species of fermions and the interaction is purely local , the fermionic part simply reduces to the free fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "the total hamiltonian therefore has the following form @xmath27",
    "following the very successful dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and gutzwiller @xcite schemes , which are exact in infinite dimensions , we consider first the infinite - dimensional limit ( @xmath28 ) of the bose - fermi mixture , which is expected to be a good approximation to three spatial dimensions .",
    "the main idea of the dmft approach is to map the quantum lattice problem with many degrees of freedom onto a single site - the _ `` impurity site '' _ - coupled self - consistently to a non - interacting bath . to derive the self - consistency equations for this model",
    ", we use the `` cavity method '' @xcite : one considers a single site of the lattice and integrates out the remaining degrees of freedom on all other sites . to derive the self - consistency relations",
    ", we use the path integral formalism . the important point in this derivation",
    "is that we consider the limit of infinite spatial dimensions ( i.e. lattice coordination number @xmath29 ) . to keep the kinetic energy finite ,",
    "we need to rescale the hopping parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as follows : @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "doing so , the parameter @xmath0 appears as a small parameter in the theory , which is used to control the expansion .",
    "we note here that @xmath0 is not a coupling parameter in the original hamiltonian .",
    "therefore this method is suited for the full range of couplings considered .",
    "this gives us also a way to estimate accuracy : neglecting terms of order @xmath0 leads to reasonably small errors for the three - dimensional cubic lattice where @xmath32 .",
    "the first step in this formalism is to derive the effective action of the impurity site ( for details see appendix [ derivation_effetive_action ] ) by integrating out the remaining degrees of freedom ( @xmath33 ) in the partition function : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are grassmann variables describing fermions , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are @xmath39-numbers describing bosons . to",
    "leading order in @xmath0 one obtains @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the bosonic superfluid parameter , which is static .",
    "we have introduced the weiss function @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the interacting green s function for the fermions , and @xmath44 means summation only over the nearest neighbors of the `` impurity site '' .",
    "the expectation values are here calculated in the cavity system without the impurity site , which is indicated by the notation @xmath45 .    ) . ]",
    "the next step in the derivation is that the expectation values in the cavity system are identified with the expectation values on the impurity site .",
    "this means that we identify @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where the notation @xmath48 means expectation value for the impurity site . in passing by , we note that this involves again an error of order @xmath0 ( vanishing in the limit of high dimensionality ) , since a site at the edge of the cavity has one neighbor less compared to the impurity site .",
    "however , in this way , we have derived a self - consistency relation , which only involves the impurity site .    by inspecting these self - consistency relations ,",
    "it becomes clear that the bosonic part corresponds to the gutzwiller approximation , whereas the fermionic part corresponds to dmft .",
    "the two are coupled by the on - site density - density interaction .",
    "we note here that this derivation shows that the gutzwiller approximation for bosons is exact in infinite dimensions , and , like dmft , valid for arbitrary couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore this approximation is able to describe the whole phase - diagram , in particular the transition from superfluid to mott - insulator .",
    "this point is not always appreciated in the literature , where the gutzwiller approximation is sometimes regarded as a strong - coupling approximation .    summarizing ,",
    "the gdmft employed in our calculation consists of the dmft algorithm for the fermions , combined with bosonic gutzwiller mean - field theory .",
    "the bosons are described by the superfluid order parameter @xmath49 while the fermions are characterized by the weiss green s function @xmath50 where @xmath51 are matsubara frequencies .",

    "[ gdmft_pic ] .",
    "the self - consistency equation for the fermions assumes the simplest form for the bethe lattice which is schematically depicted in fig . [ bethe ] and has a semi - elliptic non - interacting density of states @xmath52 .",
    "the reason for this simplification is that for the bethe lattice the summation in eq .",
    "( [ weiss ] ) is reduced to @xmath53 , because all neighbors of `` impurity site '' are decoupled .",
    "the self - consistency relation for fermions on the bethe lattice is therefore @xmath54 the self - consistent gdmft loop has the following structure : we start from an initial guess of the weiss green s function and superfluid order parameter .",
    "the effective action of the model is then given by eq .",
    "( [ action2 ] ) , which allows us to calculate all local green s functions and expectation values , including the interacting green s function and the superfluid order parameter .",
    "the loop is closed by eq .",
    "( [ weiss_bethe ] ) , from which we calculate the new weiss green s function .",
    "this procedure is repeated until convergence is reached .",
    "the most difficult step in the procedure outlined above is the calculation of the local green s function from the effective action .",
    "we use the numerical renormalization group for this purpose , which is non - perturbative and provides reliable low - frequency information .    to be able to employ nrg",
    ", we map the self - consistent single - site model onto a generalized single impurity anderson model ( gsiam ) , which by construction has exactly the same effective action ( [ action2 ] ) as the initial hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . as in the conventional single impurity anderson model ( siam ) ,",
    "the impurity site is coupled to a non - interacting fermionic bath which - like the effective action ( [ action2 ] ) - needs to be determined self - consistently in dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "in addition , the gsiam now also contains a bosonic degree of freedom on the `` impurity site '' , which is self - consistently coupled to the superfluid order parameter , according to gutzwiller mean - field theory . in summary , the gsiam is described by the following hamiltonian , which allows for a two - sublattice structure : @xmath55   \\\\ & & \\hspace{-6mm}\\mathcal{\\hat h}_{b}^{\\alpha } = - z t_b ( \\varphi_{\\bar \\alpha}^{\\phantom \\star } \\hat b^\\dagger_{\\alpha } +   \\varphi^{\\star}_{\\bar\\alpha } \\hat b_{\\alpha}^{\\phantom\\dagger } ) + \\frac{u_{b}}{2 } \\hat n^{b}_{\\alpha } ( \\hat n^{b}_{\\alpha } -1 ) - \\mu_b   \\hat n^b_{\\alpha }   \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\hspace{-6mm}\\mathcal{\\hat h}_{fb}^{\\alpha } = u_{fb } \\hat n_{\\alpha}^f",

    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ gsiam ] ) can be diagonalized using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "the key idea of this method is to perform a logarithmic discretization of the conduction band in order to exploit the separation of energy scales crucial for a renormalization group treatment . by an additional unitary transformation",
    "the conduction band is mapped onto a semi - infinite linear chain .",
    "the fermionic part of our generalized anderson impurity model ( gsiam ) in eq .",
    "( [ gsiam ] ) then takes the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the fermion creation operators and the hopping coefficients on the linear chain .",

    "@xmath66 is the on - site energy for site @xmath67 of the linear chain . due to the logarithmic discretization",
    ", the hopping parameters and onsite energies now decay exponentially @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the nrg discretization parameter , which in our calculations we have chosen as @xmath71 .    as is obvious from eq .",
    "[ gsiam ] , the bosons are incorporated only on the `` impurity site '' and self - consistently coupled to the superfluid order parameter .",
    "this means that they will not affect the renormalization scheme of nrg , but only the construction of the `` impurity '' hamiltonian . in order to keep the dimension of the impurity site hilbert space small enough to handle it numerically",
    ", we use a cut - off for the number of bosons on the impurity site , which can be kept low due to the repulsive interactions , which suppress multiple occupancy of the bosons .",
    "the renormalization scheme of nrg then works as follows @xcite : in each step one more site of the linear chain is added to the hamiltonian , and using the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in the previous step one can build the hamiltonian for this system . the next step is to diagonalize the new hamiltonian and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the size of the hilbert space after adding one more site increases by a factor @xmath72 for two - component fermions and by a factor @xmath73 for spinless ones . to limit the matrix size",
    ", one then keeps only the @xmath74 lowest energy levels ( usually @xmath75 ) in each step .",
    "this truncation scheme is controlled by the energy scale separation discussed above . the number of iterations @xmath76 is directly related to the temperature of the system as @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the fermionic half - bandwidth . in zero temperature calculations , such as in this work",
    ", @xmath76 is chosen large enough to yield a temperature below any intrinsic energy scale of the system .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath79 .    from the eigenstates and matrix elements thus obtained one can then calculate any local expectation value or correlation function , such as the superfluid order parameter @xmath80 and the local fermionic interacting ( impurity ) spectral function @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that the final result of the gdmft calculations should not depend on the initial conditions of the self - consistency loop .",
    "however , for physical reasons it can happen that the self - consistent gdmft procedure yields multiple stable solutions . to find the ground state of the system in those cases , we need to compare the energies of the coexisting solutions .",
    "the ground state will correspond to the solution with the lowest energy . for this purpose",
    "we need to calculate the total energy which is given as follows : @xmath82 where the index @xmath56 corresponds to the two different sublattices . to calculate the fermionic part of the kinetic energy above",

    "@xmath83 is the fermionic non - interacting density of states and @xmath84 is a spectral function , with @xmath85 .",
    "we calculate the self - energy as follows @xcite(for details see appendix [ derivation_self_energy ] ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a local fermionic single - particle green s function , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 denotes the opposite spin state .    for nonzero temperature ( not considered here )",
    "the free energy is the relevant quantity , which means that also the entropy has to be calculated .",
    "we close this section with a short summary of the method .",
    "the gdmft technique is a combination of the dmft and gutzwiller approaches .",
    "we have shown that it is exact in infinite dimensions , and it is assumed to be a good approximation for three spatial dimensions ( with the lattice coordination number @xmath32 ) .",
    "fermionic dmft calculations in three dimensions show indeed excellent agreement with qmc calculations @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "the only small parameter in this method is @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the lattice coordination number ) .",
    "gdmft therefore incorporates local correlations between bosons and fermions in a fully non - perturbative fashion .",
    "non - local correlations , on the other hand , can be calculated only on a mean - field level .    since the fermions are treated with a _",
    "dynamical _ mean - field , their quantum fluctuations are also captured .",
    "higher orders in @xmath0 could make quantitative changes , but no qualitative changes are expected .",
    "the bosons on the other hand are treated in static mean field and couple only to the bosonic order parameter .",
    "although this is indeed exact in infinite dimensions , for a finite number of spatial dimensions even normal ( i.e. non - superfluid ) bosons will hop . this will e.g. affect the fluctuations in the boson number @xmath91 .",
    "within the gutzwiller approximation this quantity is zero in the mott insulator and alternating mott insulator phase ( which will be defined in the next section ) .",
    "the inclusion of normal hopping would lead to finite fluctuations .",
    "this effect is however not essential for the physics of the supersolid discussed here . in future calculations ,",
    "normal bosonic hopping could be included via the recently developed bosonic dmft ( bdmft ) @xcite .",
    "the above derivation was valid independently of temperature and impurity solver .",
    "therefore , gdmft also gives a reliable description of a bose - fermi mixture in an optical lattice at any finite temperature . as an impurity solver one can use nrg @xcite or exact diagonalization@xcite which works very convenient at finite temperature . in the present work ,",
    "we only apply it at @xmath92 and using nrg as an impurity solver .",
    "the supersolid phase - the phase with coexisting broken @xmath93 symmetry and particle wave density order - is one of the intriguing subjects in condensed matter physics .",
    "it is still an open question whether a supersolid has been realized in recent experiments on @xmath94he  @xcite . while in single - component quantum gases supersolids",
    "can only be stabilized by including nearest neighbor repulsion between the particles @xcite , they can be conveniently realized in bose - fermi mixtures with on - site repulsion in an optical lattice where the fermions are at half filling @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for this mixture of bosons and spinless fermions is given in eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian_spinless ] .",
    "the mechanism for supersolid formation here is the instability of fermions at half - filling towards charge - density wave ( cdw ) formation because of fermi surface nesting .",
    "the bosons act as impurities for the fermions , which drives the system into this phase with broken translational symmetry . since the bosons remain superfluid for moderate interactions , the associated @xmath93 symmetry and the translational symmetry are simultaneously broken . for strong bose - fermi interactions , on the other hand , fermions and bosons",
    "avoid each other and are localized in different sublattices , thus forming an alternating mott insulator ( ami ) phase as shown before @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we studied the bose - fermi mixture for the case when both species were half - filled .",
    "we obtained three different phases : ( i ) supersolid phase for small bose - fermi interaction and strong boson - boson interaction , ( ii ) ami phase for strong fermi - bose and boson - boson interaction and ( iii ) phase separation for small boson - boson interaction .     and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the half - band width of the fermions .",

    "we remark here that those results , and also the results obtained in this paper , are obtained with a density of states without van hove singularities .",
    "in fact , the results were obtained using the density of states of the bethe lattice , which is semi - elliptic and regular everywhere .",
    "we were still able to identify a supersolid phase , proving the point that a singularity in the non - interacting states is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of a supersolid .",
    "however , because of the lack of singularities in the density of states , the particle density oscillation and the gap in the spectrum in the supersolid phase were rather small .",
    "therefore , in this paper we study a different case where the filling of fermions is @xmath2 , while the filling of the bosons is higher , namely @xmath97 .",

    "here the bosonic density is alternating between @xmath106 and @xmath73 on neighboring lattice sites . if we continue to increase the interaction , only the amplitude of the fermionic density oscillations slowly increases .",
