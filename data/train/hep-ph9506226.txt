    "we will consider cross sections at fixed photon energies .",
    "when necessary , a discussion of the energy dependence of the distributions will be given .",
    "we will also consider electroproduction for small photon virtuality , in the weizscker - williams approximation , which is appropriate for the bulk of the photoproduction cross section .",
    "we will not consider the production of heavy flavours in deeply inelastic events , i.e. events in which high photon virtuality is required ( see refs .  [ [ virtualphoton ] ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we study the point - like contribution of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions in photoproduction .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the study of the hadronic component , considering the possibility of separating it from the point - like component with appropriate cuts . in sections  4 and 5",
    "we consider electroproduction of charm and bottom , in the weizscker - williams approximation . in section  6",
    "we compare our fixed - order results with those of the monte carlo herwig [ [ herwig ] ] , and in section  7 we give our conclusions .",
    "some technical details on the factorization schemes , the scale dependence , and the modified weizscker - williams approximation used here are given in the appendix .",
    "unless specifically stated , we will use in the following the set of parton densities mrsa , ref .  [ [ mrsa ] ] , with @xmath5mev .",
    "this set of distribution functions has been recently updated ( mrsg , ref .  [ [ mrsg ] ] ) , to include new hera deep inelastic scattering data , allowing a different small-@xmath6 behaviour of the gluon and sea quark densities .",
    "we have checked that the shapes of the single - inclusive distributions we are considering are not significantly different when the new parametrization is used .",
    "the default value of the charm quark mass will be @xmath7gev .",
    "the renormalization scale will be taken as @xmath8 , and the factorization scale for the proton and for the photon will be taken as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "we begin by showing the transverse momentum distribution for the charm quark in fig .",
    "[ pt286pnt ] , for @xmath11  gev ( the proton energy @xmath12 will be fixed in the following to be 820 gev ) .",
    "we also show the effect of applying the peterson fragmentation function  [ [ pete ] ] d(x)= to the final state quark .",
    "we use the value @xmath13 , which is the central value quoted in ref .",
    "[ [ chrin ] ] for charm quarks .",
    "as can be expected this softens considerably the @xmath14 spectrum . as discussed in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnrft ] ] , in the case of fixed target photoproduction experiments , the inclusion of peterson fragmentation correctly reproduces the shape of the measured @xmath14 distribution .",
    "the effect of a pseudorapidity cut similar to the one applied by the zeus collaboration [ [ zeuscharm ] ] is also shown . at low to moderate @xmath14",
    "this cut considerably lowers the cross section , while at higher @xmath14 it has a negligible effect . in fig .",
    "[ ptkickpnt ] we compare the @xmath14 distributions at different photon energies .",
    "we also illustrate the effect of applying an intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath15 to the incoming parton ( see ref .",
    "[ [ fmnrft ] ] ) .",
    "we find that even with the very large value of @xmath16gev@xmath17 the effect is small .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will neglect the effect of an intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons .",
    "pseudorapidity distributions for charm are shown in fig .",
    "[ eta286pnt ] for @xmath11  gev .",
    "we observe that the point - like contribution to the cross section at this energy strongly favours large negative pseudorapidities .",
    "a cut on the transverse momentum of the produced quark tends to move the distribution towards the central region .",
    "the dotted curve shows the effect of fragmentation in the presence of a transverse momentum cut .",
    "the fragmentation has little effect on the pseudorapidity of the quark , but degrades its transverse momentum , so that the @xmath14 cut has a stronger effect .",
    "the effect of fragmentation without transverse momentum cut is not shown in the figure , since it is not well defined ( see ref .",
    "[ [ fmnrft ] ] ) .    at lower energies ( fig .",
    "[ eta99pnt ] ) the pseudorapidity distributions become more central .",
    "we now turn to the sensitivity of our distributions to the various parameters that enter the computation .",
    "we have studied the dependence of our distributions upon the charm quark mass , by varying it between @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev , on the renormalization scale , which was varied by a factor of 2 below and above its default value , and upon the distribution functions , by considering the mrsd@xmath20 [ [ mrsdmeno ] ] and the cteq2mf [ [ cteq2mf ] ] sets .",
    "the proton parton densities were chosen in order to span the allowed range for the small-@xmath6 behaviour of the gluon density , mrsd@xmath20 being the most singular , and cteq2mf the least singular one ( see ref .",
    "[ [ fmnr_tot ] ] for a discussion of this point ) . studying the variation of our results with respect to @xmath21 is a difficult problem , since the values of @xmath21 extracted from fits to deep inelastic scattering data are not in good agreement with the lep value .",
    "the cteq group has provided a parton density set in which the value of @xmath21 was pushed as high as possible ( see also ref .",
    "[ [ grv_lam ] ] ) .",
    "they use a value of @xmath22mev , which is still below the lep value , but adequate for a study of the sensitivity of the distributions .",
    "the set of parton densities obtained in this fit ( cteq2ml ) was used in association with this value of @xmath21 .",
    "we found that the only cases in which there is a noticeable shape variation is in the @xmath14 distributions when we vary the mass and the parton densities .",
    "the relevant plots are given in figs .",
    "[ pt286pnt_mvar ] and [ pt286pnt_strfvar ] .    from the figures we can see a comparable variation of the @xmath14 spectrum in the low momentum region in the two cases .",
    "the mass dependence is easily understood .",
    "we expect nearly no mass dependence at high transverse momenta , while in the massless limit the cross section diverges at small momenta .",
    "therefore , the smaller the mass , the higher the cross section at low @xmath14 .",
    "as far as the distribution function dependence is concerned , the small-@xmath6 uncertainty in the densities plays here a major rle . the more singular the small-@xmath6 behaviour , the higher the cross section at small @xmath23 .    as a last point",
    ", we observe that , when measuring the total cross section , if a transverse momentum cut on the @xmath14 spectrum is being applied , the extrapolated total cross section will depend upon the assumptions we make about the value of the mass and the small-@xmath6 behaviour of the distribution functions .",
    "this has to be properly taken into account when inferring properties of the parton density at small @xmath6 from the energy behaviour of the total charm cross section .",
    "the point - like contribution of the charm cross sections will be contaminated by the hadronic component .",
    "depending upon the chosen distribution functions for the photon , the contribution of the hadronic component to the total cross section may dominate over the point - like one . whatever the choice of the distribution functions , however , the two components differ remarkably in the pseudorapidity distribution . the point - like component , as we have seen , favours negative pseudorapidities , while the hadronic component favours the positive direction .",
    "the separation of the two components will therefore require an analysis of a large pseudorapidity range . in the following",
    ", we will show a study of the full ( i.e. point - like plus hadronic ) pseudorapidity distribution for different choices of photon and proton distribution functions .",
    "we will see that the shape and magnitude of the @xmath24 distribution will allow us to distinguish between the most extreme parametrizations of photon distribution functions . in fig .",
    "[ pdf_lac1_sum_286 ] we show the @xmath24 distribution , obtained with the lac1  [ [ lac1 ] ] set of photon parton densities , and three different sets of proton parton densities ; both the point - like and the full results are presented .    a similar plot for the grv  [ [ grvph ] ] set for the photon is given in fig .  [ pdf_grv_sum_286 ] .",
    "we have chosen the lac1 and grv sets because , for our purposes , they represent the two extreme possibilities , as discussed in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnr_tot ] ] . in figs .",
    "[ pdf_lac1_sum_286 ] and [ pdf_grv_sum_286 ] we have imposed a realistic transverse momentum cut , which in general will make the pseudorapidity distribution even narrower . in spite of the cut",
    ", the separation of the two contributions is quite apparent .",
    "the study of the pseudorapidity distribution could help in distinguishing among different proton parton density sets , especially if the large negative pseudorapidity region could be explored . on the other hand ,",
    "the large difference in shape induced by the two photon sets considered has measurable effects even in the central region .",
    "the full transverse momentum distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ pt286full ] .",
    "the point - like and hadronic contributions are also separately shown . from the figure",
    ", we can see that the hadronic contribution is dominant in the low-@xmath14 region . at @xmath25  gev , it amounts to 50% of the full cross section . therefore , even without investigating the very low-@xmath14 region , the softer behaviour of the full cross section with respect to the point - like one should be visible .    obviously , this behaviour is strongly influenced by the photon parton densities used .",
    "if the grv set were used , instead of the lac1 set , the full distribution would differ only sligthly from the point - like one already at moderate @xmath14 .",
    "we can conclude that the charm transverse momentum spectrum at large values of the photon energy could help in further constraining the parton densities in the photon . from fig .",
    "[ pdf_lac1_sum_286 ] , we also learn that asymmetric pseudorapidity cuts may enhance or suppress the effect of the hadronic component in the @xmath14 spectrum , thus providing another handle for its study .",
    "in this section we discuss single - inclusive distributions for charm production in electron - proton collisions in the weizscker - williams approximation .",
    "we take the electron and proton energies to be @xmath26  gev and @xmath27  gev , respectively . since the weizscker - williams function peaks in the small-@xmath6 region",
    ", the bulk of the contribution to the cross section will be due to photons of relatively low energy .",
    "therefore , the rle of the hadronic component is less important with respect to the monochromatic photon case . by applying a small-@xmath14 cut ,",
    "the contribution of the hadronic component is even more suppressed , especially for soft photon parton densities .",
    "therefore , the qcd predictions at next - to - leading order are less affected by the uncertainty originating from the photon distribution functions .    because of the softness of the incoming photons , the pseudorapidity distribution of the point - like component is concentrated in the central region .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ el_eta_all ] , where we show the pseudorapidity distribution for charm quarks , supplemented with peterson fragmentation and a transverse momentum cut .",
    "the hadronic component is computed using our two extreme sets of photon parton densities .",
    "it is apparent that its effect is small in the central pseudorapidity region explored at hera .    the curves in fig .",
    "[ el_eta_all ] are obtained with @xmath28  gev , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the mrsa set for proton parton densities . while the total cross section is quite sensitive to the value of these parameters , as shown in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnr_tot ] ] , the shape of the single - inclusive distributions is rather stable .",
    "the pseudorapidity distribution shape is only mildly dependent upon the choice of proton parton densities .",
    "this is due to the fact that the various parametrizations differ in the small-@xmath6 region , which is not deeply probed in the electroproduction process .",
    "this is shown , for the point - like component , in fig .",
    "[ el_eta_pdf ] .",
    "the proton parton density dependence of the hadronic component is completely negligible , due to the softness of the partons in the electron .",
    "we now consider the transverse momentum distribution . in fig .",
    "[ el_pt_pnt ] we show the point - like contribution to this differential cross section , with and without peterson fragmentation",
    ". the softening of the distribution due to fragmentation should be observable at hera .",
    "the effect of applying a pseudorapidity cut is also shown : it affects the shape of the distribution less dramatically than in the case discussed in section 2 .",
    "we have checked that the hadronic component contribution to this distribution is remarkably softer than the point - like one . in practice ,",
    "its effect is less than 10% for @xmath29  gev when fragmentation is included and the pseudorapidity cut @xmath30 is applied .",
    "we have also computed the same distribution for different values of the renormalization and factorization scales , and we found that the corresponding shape variations are small .",
    "all the distributions presented so far were also evaluated in the case when an antitag condition on the outgoing electron is applied , that is to say when the electron scattering angle is below a given value , which we chose to be 5  mrad . for this computation , the improved form of the weizscker - williams distribution presented in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnrww ] ] is appropriate ( see the appendix ) .",
    "differences in the shapes of the distributions are found to be small . as an example , we show in fig .  [ el_eta_cut_pnt ] the pseudorapidity distribution with and without the antitag condition described above . the antitag condition has the effect of decreasing the total cross section , as described in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnr_tot ] ] , of slightly enhancing the contribution of positive pseudorapidities , and of mildly softening the transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "we can conclude that charm electroproduction distributions are rather insensitive to the choice of the parameters entering the perturbative calculation .",
    "therefore , single - inclusive charm electroproduction will be of little help in constraining the parton distribution functions of both the proton and the photon",
    ". on the other hand , the comparison between data and theoretical predictions will be useful for the study of the production mechanism .",
    "due to the higher value of the quark mass , perturbative qcd predictions for bottom production are more reliable than those for charm . furthermore , we are able to study the scale dependence in an exhaustive manner .",
    "in fact , the factorization scale , when varied by a factor of two below and above its default value , is always higher than the mininum allowed by the distribution function parametrizations . in fig .",
    "[ b_el_eta_var ] we show the point - like component of the pseudorapidity distribution for bottom electroproduction .",
    "the solid curve represents our central prediction , which corresponds to choosing @xmath31  gev , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the qcd result is supplemented with peterson fragmentation with @xmath34 , the central value of ref .",
    "[ [ chrin ] ] for bottom quarks . in the case of bottom",
    "the effect of fragmentation is less important than in the case of charm .",
    "the band between the two dashed curves has been obtained by varying the bottom quark mass between 4.5 and 5  gev and the renormalization and factorization scales between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the proton parton density set chosen is mrsa .",
    "we also show ( dotted curve ) the result obtained with a parton density set fitted at a higher value of @xmath37 , namely the set cteq2ml with @xmath38  mev , and the central values of mass and scales .",
    "it is difficult to foresee what a realistic transverse momentum cut could be for bottom production , and we have therefore kept the same cut @xmath39  gev we used in the charm case .",
    "figure  [ b_el_eta_var ] does not describe the uncertainties on the theoretical prediction completely , because the cteq2ml set was used keeping the scales and the mass at their default value , and because the hadronic contribution was not included .",
    "the full uncertainty on the @xmath24 distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ b_el_eta_all ] , in which mass and scales are varied also when using the cteq2ml set , and the possibility is considered that the effect of the hadronic component is as large as the lac1 set implies , or is completely absent .",
    "the dramatic effect of the inclusion of the hadronic component is apparent in the positive pseudorapidity region .",
    "this is due to the very soft behaviour of the lac1 partons and to the stronger sensitivity of the hadronic component to the choice of mass and scales with respect to the one of the point - like component .",
    "we now turn to the transverse momentum distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ b_el_pt_var ] , which is analogous to the corresponding figure for the @xmath24 distribution , fig .",
    "[ b_el_eta_var ] .",
    "as expected , in the large-@xmath14 region the sensitivity to mass and scales choice is strongly reduced .",
    "therefore , the perturbative prediction becomes more reliable there .    the full uncertainty on the @xmath14 distribution is given in fig .",
    "[ b_el_pt_all ] , which is analogous to fig .",
    "[ b_el_eta_all ] . from the figure , it is quite clear that even with the lac1 set the hadronic component affects the prediction only marginally .",
    "this fact is a consequence of the applied pseudorapidity cut , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ b_el_eta_all ] .",
    "we can therefore regard fig .",
    "[ b_el_pt_all ] as a reliable prediction of qcd for the @xmath14 spectrum of @xmath40 hadrons at hera .",
    "in order to assess the influence of higher - order and non - perturbative contributions on the shape of single - inclusive distributions , we have compared our fixed - order calculations with the results obtained with the parton - shower monte carlo program herwig  [ [ herwig ] ] . when using herwig we have always excluded the flavour excitation processes .",
    "this is because comparable processes , such as gluon splitting , are difficult to include .",
    "we have therefore preferred to use the monte carlo at a consistent level of accuracy . as discussed in section  2 ,",
    "the effect of an intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons is negligible in photoproduction at hera energies .",
    "this leads us to expect that higher - order and non - perturbative corrections are not as important here as in the case of hadroproduction  [ [ fmnrft ] ] . on the other hand , it is interesting to investigate how peterson fragmentation compares with the model of cluster hadronization implemented in herwig .",
    "we limit our discussion to the point - like component of the photoproduction cross section for fixed photon energy .    in fig .",
    "[ pt_vs_hrwg ] we show the transverse momentum distribution computed in fixed - order perturbation theory and with herwig .",
    "all herwig curves have been normalized to give the same total cross section of the corresponding next - to - leading order qcd predictions .",
    "we observe that before the hadronization process is switched on , the qcd prediction and the herwig result agree almost perfectly in all the presented @xmath14 range ( upper curves ) .",
    "we then consider the effect of hadronization in the central pseudorapidity region ( @xmath30 ) by comparing the perturbative prediction supplemented with peterson fragmentation and the herwig results for charmed hadrons or @xmath41 mesons only ( lower curves ) . in this case",
    "the two predictions display a different behaviour only in the low-@xmath14 region .",
    "this is also the only part of the @xmath14 spectrum that is significantly affected by the pseudorapidity cut .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ pt_vs_hrwg ] allow us to conclude that peterson fragmentation gives a description of the hadronization process , which is consistent with the one suggested by cluster models only at sufficiently large transverse momenta .    a similar study for the pseudorapidity distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ eta_vs_hrwg ] .    in this case",
    ", some difference is observed between the two distributions before hadronization , the fixed - order qcd prediction being slightly broader .",
    "however , they are peaked around the same value of @xmath24 , which is rather far from the central region , where the experimental acceptance is larger . applying a small transverse momentum cut ,",
    "the use of peterson fragmentation becomes possible also for the pseudorapidity distribution .",
    "we are therefore able to compare the qcd next - to - leading order distribution , convoluted with the peterson fragmentation function , and the herwig curves for charmed hadrons .",
    "we find a complete agreement between the two .",
    "we have performed the same kind of analysis on the hadronic component , and we found that the qualitative behaviour is completely analogous to what has been presented for the point - like component .",
    "we have studied single - inclusive cross sections for charm and bottom production at hera .",
    "we considered charm production in monochromatic photon - proton collisions , for energies spanning the range accessible at hera .",
    "we found that the shape of the @xmath14 and pseudorapidity distributions are quite stable with respect to the variation of the input parameters entering the calculation . on the other hand , the total cross section value ( see ref .",
    "[ [ fmnr_tot ] ] for a discussion on this point ) is strongly affected by the choice of parameters .",
    "we found that from the study of the pseudorapidity distributions in the central @xmath24 region ( @xmath30 ) it is difficult to distinguish between the various proton parton densities with different small-@xmath6 behaviour . on the other hand ,",
    "the striking difference between the predictions obtained by using the lac1 and grv set for photon distribution functions is clearly visible .",
    "this fact is almost completely due to the very soft behaviour of the lac1 parton densities .    the transverse momentum distribution for large @xmath14 is reliably predicted by qcd .",
    "measurements in this region should constitute a good test of the production mechanism . at moderate @xmath14 ,",
    "the point - like result is strongly influenced by the hadronic contribution when the lac1 set for photon parton densities is used .",
    "experimental investigations in this region of the spectrum could therefore help to distinguish among the various parton distribution functions in the photon .",
    "charm electroproduction is a less clean test of the production mechanism with respect to monochromatic photon production , because of the convolution with the weizscker - williams function . on the other hand ,",
    "the softness of the latter implies a strongly reduced dependence of the total cross section upon the phenomenological parameters entering the calculation .",
    "furthermore , when a small transverse momentum cut is applied , the hadronic contribution is more suppressed than the point - like one , whatever the photon densitites used .",
    "therefore , electroproduction is less sensitive to the contamination of the hadronic component than photoproduction with a monochromatic photon , and can be used to further investigate the point - like production mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , a sizeable dependence upon charm mass and renormalization scale remains in the total cross section prediction .",
    "the case in which an antitag condition is applied on the outgoing electron was also studied . aside from the effect on the total cross section value ( which has already been discussed in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnr_tot ] ] ) , the angular cut slightly enhances the importance of the central pseudorapidity region and mildly softens the transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "we also considered the production of bottom quarks in @xmath42 collisions . due to the higher value of the quark mass , perturbative qcd predictions for bottom production",
    "are more reliable than those for charm .",
    "it turns out that the point - like component is quite stable in shape .",
    "the hadronic component has a dramatic effect on the pseudorapidity distribution , although less important than in the case of charm .",
    "its effect in the central @xmath24 region is however marginal .",
    "we are therefore able to give a reliable prediction of the @xmath14 spectrum for @xmath40 hadrons in the central @xmath24 region .    finally , we compared our results with those obtained using the parton shower monte carlo herwig .",
    "we limited our discussion to the point - like component for monochromatic photon - proton collisions . as far as open charm quark",
    "is concerned , we found perfect agreement for the @xmath14 distribution , in the whole range considered .",
    "the next - to - leading order qcd prediction for pseudorapidity distribution is instead slightly broader than the one given by herwig in the region around the peak .",
    "this difference is however immaterial in the central pseudorapidity region , which is explored by the experiments .",
    "we also point out that , without any small transverse momentum cut , differential cross sections in  longitudinal \" quantities such as @xmath24 are indeed not characterized by a true hard scale . in this case ,",
