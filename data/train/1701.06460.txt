    "the displacement field @xmath1 induced by an axial screw dislocation in a @xmath0 fcc metal nanowire has been studied in detail recently.@xcite for a circular cross section , the @xmath1 field presents the two - fold symmetry of the @xmath0 orientation with an azimuthal @xmath2 dependence that is controlled by the anisotropy of the shear modulus .",
    "this latter is significant for palladium since like in the case of copper @xcite the values of the elastic moduli are similar with @xmath3 gpa and @xmath4 gpa in the @xmath5 , [ 01\\overline{1 } ] , [ 011]\\}$ ] coordinate system .    to illustrate the importance of these anisotropic effects ,",
    "let us calculate the azimuthal dependence of two particular quantities discussed in the article of lrps@xcite ( and reported in their figure 6d ) , namely the deviatoric strain term due to the screw deformation only and the one due to the twist only .",
    "these latter , denoted here @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , are plotted in figure [ devia ] as a function of the radial distance @xmath8 but also for all azimuth @xmath2 .",
    "and @xmath7 calculated from anisotropic elasticity for all azimuth @xmath2 from ref .",
    "[ ] . clearly for palladium , values of @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "spread over large domains bounded by extrema ( for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) that differ by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "the isotropic @xmath12 is also reported ( red dotted line ) , it vanishes for @xmath13.,width=321 ]    clearly the azimuthal exploration shows that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 belong to large domains bounded by extremum values ( for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) that differ by a ratio equal to @xmath16 .",
    "incidentally , we wish to comment the analysis made of the deviatoric strain terms in the figure 6d , that leads the authors to conclude at the end of section iii : _",
    "`` ... , so that the combined effect ( screw and twist ) gets closer to the md simulation.''_. this assertion is doubly misleading .",
    "first of all because the md simulation curve must contain the above mentioned anisotropy which is not shown on this graph ( some clarification on the method used to get the md curve would be helpful ) . and secondly because the isotropic deviatoric strain term designated as `` screw and twist deformation field '' in figure 6d does not match a calculation of the combined effect of both the dislocation and the torsion .",
    "the plot of this term denoted as @xmath12 in figure [ devia ] of the present work reveals a very different behavior since @xmath12 should vanish for @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the nanowire radius .",
    "this result can be directly understood by examining the @xmath19 and @xmath20 strain components in this isotropic case : the @xmath21 are null for both the dislocation and the torsion but the @xmath19 components have opposite signs with @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnitude of the burgers vector.@xcite consequently , since @xmath25 , one gets @xmath26 .",
    "thus , for @xmath8 approaching @xmath13 the combined effect ( screw and twist ) gets far away from the md simulations shown by the authors .    to conclude this section , we provide the expressions of the strain components @xmath19 and @xmath20 leading to the anisotropic behavior reported in figure [ devia ] .",
    "we also derive from our previous work @xcite the additional image strain field that results from the interaction of the screw dislocation with the lateral surfaces of the anisotropic cylinder .",
    "having determined the equilibrium stress components @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ref .",
    "[ ] , the derivation of the strain field becomes straightforward by using the following relations : @xmath29\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\epsilon_{r z }      = & \\frac{1}{2 c_{44 } c_{55 } } \\bigg [ - \\sigma_{\\theta z } c_{45}(\\theta ) + \\sigma_{rz } c_{44}(\\theta ) \\bigg ] \\label{derivuz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the elastic moduli can be written as @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    thus",
    ", the strain field induced by a perfect volterra screw dislocation , with burgers vector b = 1/2 @xmath35 is inversely proportional to @xmath8 with a marked @xmath2 dependence : @xmath36 the twist of the nanowire that is necessary to cancel the torque due to the dislocation produces a @xmath37 stress component ( @xmath38 is null for a circular cylinder ) that in term of strain becomes : @xmath39    finally , in the present case of an anisotropic @xmath0 nanowire of circular cross section containing a coaxial screw dislocation , an image stress field @xmath40 is necessary to fulfill the condition of a vanishing traction at the lateral surface .",
    "formally , this condition reduces to @xmath41 because @xmath42 is null for a circular cross section .",
    "thus , looking for an image field that obeys both to the boundary conditions , the equilibrium and the compatibility equations , we could obtain a numerical solution of the stress field based on a fourier series analysis .",
    "approximate expressions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 were also proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] . using eqs.([derivuz ] )",
    ", these latter can be converted in term of strain and written as : @xmath45 \\nonumber \\\\ \\epsilon^{img}_{rz } & = - \\frac{b r}{4 \\pi \\sqrt{c_{44}c_{55 } } r^2 } c_{45}(\\theta ) \\bigg [ 1 - \\ln \\bigg ( \\frac{c_{44}(\\theta)}{c_0 } \\bigg ) \\bigg ] \\label{imganalytic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 .    -0.5",
    "cm   ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) strain components calculated from our molecular statics ( ms ) simulations in ref .",
    "[ ] at different @xmath8 values in the case of an untwisted [ 110 ] circular copper nanowire of radius @xmath51 nm containing an axial screw dislocation .",
    "these results are compared to the expressions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( solid lines ) proposed in eqs .",
    "( [ derscrew ] ) and ( [ imganalytic ] ) .",
    "the boundary problem is also solved numerically through the fourier series analysis described in ref.[].,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    in ref .",
    "[ ] , the image field derived in term of stress components was compared to the one calculated from molecular statics simulations ( ms ) .",
    "similarly in the present comment , the ms simulations can serve as a reference for testing the validity of the approximate expression given in eqs.([imganalytic ] ) of the image strain . in practice",
    ", the analyticity of the tight binding potential used in our atomistic simulations allows a straightforward determination of the strain components per atom .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ deformation ] where the radial and the azimuthal dependencies of the strain field components @xmath19 and @xmath20 resulting from our ms simulations are plotted in the case of an untwisted cu nanowire of radius 30 nm containing a screw dislocation at its center ( the torsion can be treated separately since it does not affect the image field for a circular cross section ) .",

    "( [ derscrew ] ) combined with the image field in eq .",

    "this anisotropy is particularly pronounced for copper ( as for palladium ) .",
    "it controls for instance the shape of the eshelby potential well that traps the screw dislocation at the center of the twisted nanowire.@xcite",
    "at the end of their article , lrps arrive at the conclusion that _ `` the twist weakens the correlation between more distant regions of the cylindrical domain , up to the point that needle - like nanocrystals appear as made of sub - domains ( ... ) which scatter incoherently.''_.      we believe rather that this apparent loss of correlation should be presented as a limitation of the technique employed ( i.e. , the wppm analysis combined with x - ray powder diffraction ) that does not permit to discern if the above sub - domains scatter coherently or incoherently in such twisted samples . besides , it is worth completing that there are other techniques like x - ray coherent diffraction that are capable to show the interference phenomena that occur from the different sub - domains .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us for instance consider the model system envisaged by lrps made of two identical pd cylinders with the upper one rotated by different angles around the common [ hh0 ] axis . according to these authors _",
    "`` a wppm analysis of the corresponding powder patterns shows that for tilt angles @xmath54 1.5 @xmath55 coherence between the two half - cylinders is completely lost , so that powder diffraction `` sees '' completely separate ( incoherently scattering ) domains''_. considering now the same sample studied with x - ray coherent diffraction , this supposed `` loss of coherence '' is not observed .",
    "figure [ coherent ] shows an example of large tilt angle ( 3 degrees ) where clearly one can make the difference between the real diffraction pattern from the two cylinders [ fig.[coherent](a ) ] and the one that would correspond to incoherent diffraction [ fig.[coherent](b ) ] .",
