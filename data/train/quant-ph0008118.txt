    "magnetic traps are particularly versatile , since they can be used for any atomic species possessing a magnetic moment , and provide conservative potentials even for long trapping times . although the magnetic potential has merely served as a container in most experiments to date , it also provides an excellent means for more complex manipulation of atomic wave packets . in resonator qed experiments @xcite for example ,",
    "it can be used to shift a trapped atom into and out of the quantized light field .",
    "quantum computing schemes have been proposed in which a combination of electric and magnetic potentials controls state - dependent collisions in order to entangle atomic qubits @xcite .",
    "such complex potentials can be realized when lithographic or other surface - patterning processes are used to produce the field - creating structures on a suitable substrate , now sometimes called an `` atom chip '' .",
    "the use of lithographic , planar conductor patterns for magnetic atom trapping has been proposed as early as 1995 @xcite .",
    "however , no successful experiments were carried out at that time due to the difficulty of loading such traps , which have small volumes and are typically located only a few hundred micrometers or less from the substrate surface .",
    "this situation changed last year with our demonstration of an efficient loading mechanism for surface traps @xcite .",
    "it employs a novel mirror - mot , using a reflecting layer on top of the circuit pattern to realize the laser fields for laser cooling and trapping in close proximity to the surface . with this loading mechanism ,",
    "integrated traps for cold atoms became experimentally accessible .",
    "in the first demonstration of such a trap , the new loading mechanism was employed to fill a miniature quadrupole trap featuring transverse gradients of 1700g@xmath0 cm @xcite .",
    "the trapping potential was created by a lithographically produced , u - shaped conductor in conjunction with an external bias field . in the meantime ,",
    "the same loading and trapping techniques have also been applied to construct a ioffe - pritchard ( ip ) trap for @xmath1li atoms @xcite .",
    "the mirror - mot technique has also proven its usefulness beyond lithographic traps as it was used to fill surface traps of a different type , which result from the combination of permanent surface fields on magnetic tape with an external bias field @xcite .    indeed , lithographic conductors are now increasingly employed to trap , guide and manipulate cold neutral atoms .",
    "parallel conductors have been used to realize atom guides in which atoms are confined in two dimensions and move freely along the third @xcite . very recently",
    ", more complex conductor patterns were used to realize an atomic conveyer belt , which adiabatically transports atoms and positions them with a precision of the order of @xmath2 m @xcite . moreover ,",
    "two `` beam splitters '' have been demonstrated , one which distributes a trapped cloud in a y - shaped pattern @xcite , and one which splits a guided beam using an x - shaped pattern @xcite .",
    "such devices demonstrate the versatility of the new approach . considering the relative ease of these experiments now that major obstacles have been removed , we foresee a wide variety of applications for lithographic microtraps . in this article",
    ", we discuss some key issues of microtrap design and realization .",
    "we propose a modular , intuitive approach to the design of complex potentials from a few simple building blocks . in the following sections , we tackle the substrate technology and give a detailed description of the loading procedure .",
    "the wide - ranging possibilities offered by simple conductor configurations are illustrated by experimental results of trapping in some fundamental types of potentials which would be very difficult to create by more traditional means .",
    "finally , we demonstrate a linear collider for trapped atoms , which is well suited for the study of one - dimensional collisions .",
    "in this section we present a method to design a variety of microtraps from simple 2d - conductor configurations which serve as modular building blocks . as central part",
    "we investigate the magnetic potential at a perpendicular wire intersection , which can then be used to construct more complex magnetic potentials . throughout the discussion",
    "we will denote @xmath3 the vector normal to the substrate surface , all current carrying wires are contained within the @xmath4 plane at @xmath5=0 .",
    "ioffe - pritchard ( ip ) traps can be regarded as superposition of a two - dimensional quadrupole field for transverse confinement and a longitudinally varying field for confinement along the quadrupole axis .",
    "the 2d - quadrupole field can easily be created in the vicinity of a current carrying wire ( here @xmath6 along @xmath7 , if its tangential field @xmath8 is compensated at the point @xmath9 by the homogeneous field @xmath10 ( see fig.[fig : wirequadrupole ] ) .",
    "magnetic traps and waveguides employing this scheme have been realized both with discrete @xcite and with lithographic wires @xcite .",
    "furthermore , schemes have been studied that permit the creation of quadrupole guides without the use of external fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the field strength along the longitudinal trap axis can be varied by adding another field @xmath11 to the quadrupole field @xmath12 .",
    "the components @xmath13 yield a shift of the trap position along @xmath3 and @xmath14 respectively , whereas the modulus of @xmath15 determines the field strength at the shifted minimum location . using a linear approximation for the quadrupole field",
    "@xmath16 the total field @xmath17 and the transverse trap position can be expressed to 0@xmath18 and 1@xmath19 order , respectively , as @xmath20 here @xmath21 signifies the lowest value of the magnetic field within the plane perpendicular to the @xmath22  axis , @xmath23 denotes the corresponding minimum position . according to eq.[eq : bmin ] the transverse field minimum can be approximated by @xmath24 taken at the position of the unshifted quadrupole guide .",

    "<S> lithographically fabricated circuit patterns can provide magnetic guides and microtraps for cold neutral atoms . by combining several such structures on the same ceramic substrate </S>",
    "<S> , we have realized the first `` atom chips '' that permit complex manipulations of ultracold trapped atoms or de broglie wavepackets . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to design magnetic potentials from simple conductor patterns and we describe an efficient trap loading procedure in detail . applying the design guide , we describe some new microtrap potentials , including a trap which reaches the lamb - dicke regime for rubidium atoms in all three dimensions , and a rotatable ioffe - pritchard trap , which we also demonstrate experimentally . finally , we demonstrate a device allowing independent linear positioning of two atomic clouds which are very tightly confined laterally . </S>",
    "<S> this device is well suited for the study of one - dimensional collisions .    * </S>",
