    "in a seminal paper @xcite , r. bryant has shown that the geometry of surfaces with constant mean curvature 1 in hyperbolic 3-space @xmath0 has many similarities with the geometry of minimal surfaces in euclidean space @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown in particular that such surfaces admit a weierstrass representation in terms of certain holomorphic data ( see section 3 below for details ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of this representation has allowed the construction of many complete examples ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that constant mean curvature surfaces in @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be characterized as critical points for the area functional , under compactly supported variations .",
    "( recall that in the constant mean curvature nonzero case , only volume preserving variations are allowed . ) regarding these variational problems , in the cases of complete minimal surfaces in @xmath1 and complete constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in @xmath2 , it is known that the only stable objects are planes and horospheres @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this makes all the more interesting the study of surfaces of finite index , namely , surfaces for which the dimension of the space of area decreasing variations is finite . a fundamental result regarding",
    "this point is due to fischer - colbrie @xcite , who has shown that a minimal surface in @xmath1 has finite index if and only if its total curvature is finite .",
    "( in regard to this , see also @xcite . ) in fact , fischer - colbrie s analysis allows us to obtain explicit estimates for the index of concrete examples with finite total curvature .",
    "recall that any such surface is conformally equivalent to a compact riemann surface @xmath3 punctured at finitely many points corresponding to the ends of the original surface .",
    "moreover , the gauss map of @xmath4 extends meromorphically across the punctures defining a meromorphic map @xmath5 .",
    "then , it follows from fischer - colbrie s arguments that the index of @xmath4 coincides with the index of the schrdinger operator on @xmath3 defined by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are computed relatively to any metric on @xmath3 that is conformally equivalent to the original metric on @xmath4 .    the purpose of this paper is to extend this circle of ideas to constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in @xmath0 . in this case , the role played by the map @xmath9 is replaced by the so - called secondary gauss map @xmath10 ( we describe @xmath10 below ; it is a certain multivalued map that comes from the bryant - weierstrass representation ) .",
    "it so happens that if @xmath11 has constant mean curvature 1 and finite total curvature , then @xmath4 is also conformally finite , but it is _ no _ longer true , in general , that @xmath10 extends meromorphically across the ends .",
    "this means , as we shall see , that the analysis necessary for studying the index in the @xmath0 case is much more involved than in the @xmath1 case .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the induced metric and the gaussian curvature in both cases .",
    "a common feature here is that @xmath14 and vanishes only at isolated points ( unless @xmath4 is either a plane or a horosphere ) and that @xmath15 is a spherical pseudo - metric on @xmath4 with conical singularities at these points .",
    "a crucial point here is to determine the behavior of @xmath16 at an end of @xmath4 . to this effect ,",
    "let @xmath17 be a conformal parameter around some end so that the end corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "note that , since @xmath4 is complete , @xmath12 certainly becomes infinite when @xmath19 . also , since the surface has finite total curvature , the limiting value of @xmath20 as @xmath19 is zero .",
    "so at first sight , it is unclear what the behavior of @xmath21 is at the ends .",
    "it is well known , however , that in the minimal case we can choose @xmath22 so that @xmath23 where primes denote derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath9 extends meromorphically across the ends , we can assume @xmath24 , so that @xmath16 is bounded around the end .",
    "one can now take advantage of this fact when one does the analysis necessary for examining the index of the minimal case , eventually obtaining fischer - colbrie s results . in the hyperbolic case",
    ", we shall compute below that @xmath25 but now we can only assume that @xmath26 , for some @xmath27 depending only upon the end .",
    "in particular , if @xmath28 for some end , @xmath16 is _ not _ bounded at this end and the analysis for the minimal case does not apply to this situation .",
    "doing the necessary extra analysis is the heart of this paper .",
    "more precisely , we show that the canonical form for @xmath16 ( just above ) around the ends implies that the sobolev space @xmath29 is _ compactly _ embedded in @xmath30 ( lemma 4.4 ) .",
    "once this has been established , it is an easy matter to use standard variational methods to define ind@xmath31 as being the index of a certain operator @xmath32 defined on @xmath3 and corresponding to the schrdinger operator @xmath33 in the minimal case ( section 5 ) .",
    "it follows easily from the construction that ind@xmath34 ind@xmath35 , where ind@xmath36 denotes the _ unconstrained _ index of @xmath4 , namely , the index as computed for not necessarily volume preserving variations ( it follows from our arguments that ind@xmath37 and ind@xmath38 differ at most by 1 , so that computing ind@xmath38 takes us a great deal of the way toward computing ind@xmath37 , our ultimate concern here ) .",
    "furthermore , using standard results in elliptic regularity theory , we show that the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 extend continuously across the ends ( lemma 5.2 ) .",
    "this extra regularity property enables us to show that ind@xmath39 ind@xmath36 , after an argument due to fischer - colbrie ( lemma 5.3 ) .",
    "once this analysis is done , we find that we have an alternate proof of the result by do carmo and silveira @xcite that if a constant mean curvature 1 surface in @xmath0 has finite total curvature , then it has finite index ( corollary 5.2 ) .",
    "the advantage of our way of proving this result is that it gives us tools that allow us to compute explicit bounds on index for some concrete examples .",
    "for some surfaces we can even compute the index exactly .",
    "for example , using methods similar to those of nayatani @xcite , we can compute the index of the catenoid cousins and the enneper cousins of higher winding order , as well as some other examples described by umehara and yamada @xcite ( section 6 ) .",
    "our results about the index of these examples yields some surprising differences from the index of minimal surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , unlike the minimal catenoid in @xmath1 , the catenoid cousins in @xmath0 can have arbitrarily high index ( theorem 6.1 ) .",
    "also , although the only minimal surfaces in @xmath1 with index 1 are the catenoid and enneper s surface , there are many more examples of index 1 surfaces in the hyperbolic case ( final remark of section 6 ) .    as another example , using methods similar to those of choe @xcite , we can compute lower bounds for many constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in @xmath0 ( theorem 7.1 ) .",
    "we find lower bounds for genus 1 @xmath40-noid cousins ( corollary 7.3 ) , and for genus @xmath41 costa surface cousins ( corollary 7.1 ) . and ,",
    "in general , for those constant mean curvature 1 surfaces that are constructed via a deformation method @xcite from minimal surfaces in @xmath1 , we can find a lower bound for index ( theorem 8.1 ) .",
    "the second author owes special thanks to shin nayatani for many helpful discussions .",
    "thanks are also due to pierre berard , etienne sandier , shin kato , and david goldstein .",
    "let @xmath42 be an isometric immersion of a 2-dimensional manifold @xmath4 into a complete simply - connected 3-dimensional manifold @xmath43 with constant sectional curvature @xmath44 .",

    "let @xmath54 be the area of @xmath55 and @xmath56 be the mean curvature of @xmath46 .",

    "it follows that @xmath46 is critical for area amongst all volume preserving variations .    the second variation formula for volume preserving variations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is @xmath65 where @xmath13 is the gaussian curvature on @xmath4 .",
    "since we will be investigating surfaces of constant mean curvature 1 in hyperbolic space with constant sectional curvature @xmath66 , we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath67 and @xmath68 , so @xmath69 this formula is the same for both minimal surfaces in @xmath70 and constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in @xmath71 , giving us our first indication of the close relationship between these two types of surfaces .",
    "another indication of this close relationship is the weierstrass representations described in the next section .",

    "the methods we use in this paper allow us to compute ind@xmath74(@xmath4 ) , but what we really want to compute is ind(@xmath4 ) .",
    "however , these two indices can differ by at most 1 , so computing ind@xmath74(@xmath4 ) means that we know ind(@xmath4 ) must be either ind@xmath74(@xmath4 ) or ind@xmath74(@xmath4)@xmath66 .",
    "both minimal surfaces in @xmath1 and constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in @xmath2 can be described parametrically by a pair of meromorphic functions on a riemann surface , via a weierstrass representation .",
    "first we describe the well - known weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in @xmath1",
    ". we will incorporate into this representation the fact that any complete minimal surface of finite total curvature is conformally equivalent to a riemann surface @xmath3 with a finite number of points @xmath78 removed ( @xcite ) :    let @xmath3 be a riemann surface .",

    "then @xmath84 is a conformal minimal immersion of the universal cover @xmath85 of @xmath80 into @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , any complete minimal surface with finite total curvature in @xmath1 can be represented in this way .",
    "the map @xmath9 can be geometrically interpreted as the stereographic projection of the gauss map .",
    "the first and second fundamental forms and the intrinsic gaussian curvature for the surface @xmath60 are @xmath86 where the hopf differential @xmath87 is defined to be @xmath88 .    to make a surface of finite total curvature ( i.e. @xmath89 , which is necessary to make a surface of finite index @xcite ) we must choose @xmath82 and @xmath9 so that @xmath60 is well defined on @xmath90 itself . usually this involves adjusting some real parameters in the descriptions of @xmath82 and @xmath9 and @xmath80 so that the real part of the above integral about any nontrivial loop in @xmath80 is zero .",
    "we now describe a weierstrass type representation for constant mean curvature @xmath91 surfaces in @xmath92 .",

    "furthermore , any constant mean curvature @xmath91 surface with finite total curvature in @xmath99 can be represented in this way .",

    "it is the image of the composition of two maps .",
    "the first map is from each point on the surface to the point at the sphere at infinity in the poincare model which is at the opposite end of the oriented perpendicular geodesic ray starting at the point @xmath22 on the surface .",
    "the second map is stereographic projection of the sphere at infinity to the complex plane @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the first and second fundamental forms and the intrinsic gaussian curvature of the surface are @xmath101 where in this case the hopf differential is @xmath102 ( the sign change in @xmath87 is due to the fact that we are considering the `` dual '' surface ; see @xcite for an explanation of this ) , and where @xmath10 is defined as the multi - valued meromorphic function @xmath103 on @xmath80 , with @xmath104 .",
    "the reason that @xmath10 is multi - valued is that @xmath95 itself can be multi - valued on @xmath80 ( even if @xmath60 is well defined on @xmath80 itself ) .",

    "and we further wish to give a separate notation ",
    "@xmath10  for the secondary gauss map used in the hyperbolic case .",
    "we do this to emphasize that , in relation to their geometric interpretations , the `` @xmath9 '' in the euclidean case is more closely related to the hyperbolic gauss map `` @xmath9 '' in the @xmath2 case than to the secondary gauss map `` @xmath10 '' ( as we will see in section 6 ) .    in order for @xmath60 to be well - defined on @xmath80 itself , it is sufficient and necessary that @xmath95 satisfy a condition called the @xmath107-_condition_. note that if one travels about a nontrivial loop in @xmath80 , then @xmath108 , where @xmath109 .",
    "if for every loop in @xmath80 , the resulting matrix @xmath110 satisfies @xmath111 , then the @xmath107-condition is satisfied . if @xmath111 , then @xmath112 , so it follows that if the @xmath107-condition holds , then @xmath60 is well defined on @xmath80 itself .",

    "these facts provide the motivation for the results in sections 7 and 8 of this paper :    * it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath82 and @xmath9 and @xmath80 are fixed , then as @xmath114 , the constant mean curvature @xmath91 surfaces @xmath60 in @xmath99 converge to a minimal surface in @xmath1 .",

    "consider the poincare model for @xmath99 for @xmath118 .",
    "it is a round ball in @xmath1 centered at the origin with euclidean radius @xmath119 endowed with a complete radially - symmetric metric @xmath120 of constant sectional curvature @xmath121 .",
    "contracting this model by a factor of @xmath91 , we obtain a map to the poincare model for @xmath2 . under this mapping",
    ", constant mean curvature @xmath91 surfaces are mapped to constant mean curvature @xmath122 surfaces .",
    "thus the problem of existence of constant mean curvature @xmath91 surfaces in @xmath99 for @xmath118 is equivalent to the problem of existence of constant mean curvature @xmath122 surfaces in @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , under this mapping , the area form on the constant mean curvature @xmath91 surface is changed only by a constant factor @xmath123 : if @xmath124 is the area form on the constant mean curvature @xmath91 surface , and @xmath125 is the area form on the constant mean curvature @xmath122 surface , then @xmath126 .",
    "hence a variation that reduces area on the constant mean curvature @xmath91 surface is mapped to a variation that reduces area on the constant mean curvature @xmath122 surface ( and vice - versa ) .",
