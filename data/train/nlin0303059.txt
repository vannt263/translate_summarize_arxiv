    "it is common for dynamical systems to have two or more coexisting attractors . in predicting the long - term behavior of a such a system , it is important to determine sets of initial conditions of orbits that approach each attractor ( i.e. , the basins of attraction ) .",
    "the boundaries of such sets are often fractal ( @xcite , chapter 5 of @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the fine - scale fractal structure of such a boundary implies increased sensitivity to errors in the initial conditions : even a considerable decrease in the uncertainty of initial conditions may yield only a relatively small decrease in the probability of making an error in determining in which basin such an initial condition belongs @xcite . for discussion of fractal basin boundaries in experiments ,",
    "see chapter 14 of @xcite .",
    "thompson and soliman @xcite showed that another source of uncertainty induced by fractal basin boundaries may arise in situations in which there is slow ( adiabatic ) variation of the system .",
    "for example , consider a fixed point attractor of a map ( a node ) . as",
    "a system parameter varies slowly , an orbit initially placed on the node attractor moves with time , closely following the location of the solution for the fixed point in the absence of the temporal parameter variation . as the parameter varies , the node attractor may suffer a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "for definiteness , say that the node attractor exists for values of the parameter @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 , and that the saddle - node bifurcation of the node occurs at @xmath2 .",
    "now assume that , for a parameter interval @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath4 , in addition to the node , there are also two other attractors a and b , and that the boundary of the basin of attractor a , attractor b and the node is a fractal basin boundary .",
    "we are interested in the typical case where , before the bifurcation , the saddle lies on the fractal basin boundary , and thus , at the bifurcation , the merged saddle - node orbit is on the basin boundary .",
    "in such a case an arbitrarily small ball about the saddle - node at @xmath2 contains pieces of the basins of both a and b. thus , as @xmath0 slowly increases through @xmath5 , it is unclear whether the orbit following the node will go to a or to b after the node attractor is destroyed by the bifurcation . in practice , noise or round - off error may lead the orbit to go to one attractor or the other , and the result can often depend very sensitively on the specific value of the slow rate at which the system parameter varies .",
    "we note that the study of orbits swept through an indeterminate saddle - node bifurcation belongs to the theory of dynamical bifurcations .",
    "many authors have analyzed orbits swept through other bifurcations , like the period doubling bifurcation @xcite , the pitchfork bifurcation @xcite , and the transcritical bifurcation @xcite . in all these studies of the bifurcations listed above , the local structure before _ and _ after",
    "the bifurcation includes stable invariant manifolds varying smoothly with the bifurcation parameter ( i.e. , a stable fixed point that exists before or after the bifurcation , and whose location varies smoothly with the bifurcation parameter ) .",
    "this particular feature of the local bifurcation structure , not shared by the saddle - node bifurcation , allows for well - posed , locally defined , problems of dynamical bifurcations .",
    "the static saddle - node bifurcation has received much attention in theory and experiments @xcite , but so far , no dynamical bifurcation problems have been defined for the saddle - node bifurcation . in this work , we demonstrate that , in certain common situations , global structure ( i.e. , an invariant cantor set or a fractal basin boundary ) adds to the local properties of the saddle - node bifurcation and allows for well - posed problems of dynamical bifurcations",
    ".    situations where a saddle - node bifurcation occurs on a fractal basin boundary have been studied in two dimensional poincar maps of damped forced oscillators @xcite .",
    "several examples of such systems are known @xcite , and it seems that this is a common occurence in dynamical systems . in this work ,",
    "we first focus on saddle - node bifurcations that occur for one parameter families of smooth one dimensional maps having multiple critical points ( a critical point is a point at which the derivative of the map vanishes ) .",
    "since one dimensional dynamics is simpler than two dimensional dynamics , indeterminate bifurcations can be more simply studied , without the distraction of extra mathematical structure .",
    "taking advantage of this , we are able to efficiently investigate several scaling properties of these bifurcations .",
    "in particular , we investigate the scaling of ( 1 ) the fractal basin boundary of the static ( i.e. , unswept ) system near the saddle - node bifurcation ( secs .",
    "[ sec : dim ] and [ sec : scdim ] ) , ( 2 ) the dependence of the orbit final destination on the sweeping rate ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sweep ] ) , ( 3 ) the dependence of the time it takes for an attractor to capture the swept orbit following the bifurcation on the sweeping rate ( sec .",
    "[ sec : capture ] ) , and ( 4 ) the dependence of the final attractor capture probability on the noise level ( sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] ) .",
    "following our one - dimensional investigations , we explain that these results apply to two dimensional systems .",
    "we show , through numerical experiments on the periodically forced duffing oscillator , that the scalings we have found also apply to higher dimensional systems ( sec .  [",
    "sec : duff ] ) .    for one - dimensional maps , a situation dynamically similar to that in which there is indeterminacy in which attractor captures the orbit can also occur in cases where there are two rather than three ( or more ) attractors ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we can have the situation where one attractor persists for all values of the parameters we consider , and the other attractor is a node which is destroyed via a saddle - node bifurcation on the basin boundary separating the basins of the two attractors .",
    "in such a situation , an orbit starting on the node , and swept through the saddle - node bifurcation , will go to the remaining attractor .",
    "it is possible to distinguish different ways that the orbit initially on the node approaches the remaining attractor .",
    "we find that the way in which this attractor is approached can be indeterminate .",
    "we consider the general situation of a one dimensional real map @xmath6 depending on a parameter @xmath0 . we assume the following : ( 1 ) the map is twice differentiable with respect to @xmath7 , and once differentiable with respect to @xmath0 ( the derivatives are continuous ) ;",
    "( 2 ) @xmath8 has at least two attractors sharing a fractal basin boundary for parameter values in the vicinity of @xmath5 ; and ( 3 ) an attracting fixed point @xmath9 of the map @xmath6 is destroyed by a saddle - node bifurcation as the parameter @xmath0 increases through a critical value @xmath5 , and this saddle - node bifurcation occurs on the common boundary of the basins of the two attractors .",
    "we first recall the saddle - node bifurcation theorem ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "if the map @xmath6 satisfies : ( a ) @xmath10 , ( b ) @xmath11 , ( c ) @xmath12 , and ( d ) @xmath13 , then the map @xmath8 undergoes a backward saddle - node bifurcation ( i.e. , the node attractor is destroyed at @xmath9 as @xmath0 increases through @xmath5 ) . if the inequality in either ( c ) or ( d ) is reversed , then the map undergoes a forward saddle - node bifurcation , while , if both these inequalities are reversed , the bifurcation remains backward .",
    "a saddle - node bifurcation in a one dimensional map is also called a tangent or a fold bifurcation .      as an illustration of an indeterminate saddle - node bifurcation in a one - dimensional map , we construct an example in the following way .",
    "we consider the logistic map for a parameter value where there is a stable period three orbit .",
    "we denote this map @xmath14 and its third iterate @xmath15}(x)$ ] .",
    "the map @xmath15}(x)$ ] has three stable fixed points .",
    "we perturb the map @xmath15}(x)$ ] by adding a function ( which depends on a parameter @xmath0 ) that will cause a saddle - node bifurcation of one of the attracting fixed points but not of the other two [ see figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) ] .",
    "we investigate @xmath16}(x)+\\mu\\sin(3\\pi x),\\quad \\mbox{where } \\quad g(x)=3.832\\,x(1-x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] numerical calculations show that the function @xmath6 satisfies all the conditions of the saddle - node bifurcation theorem for having a backward saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "figure 2(a ) displays how the basins of the three attracting fixed points of the map @xmath8 change with variation of @xmath0 . for @xmath19",
    "the third iterate of the logistic map is unperturbed , and it has three attracting fixed points whose basins we color - coded with blue , green and red . for every value of @xmath0",
    ", the red region @xmath20 $ ] is the set of initial conditions attracted to the rightmost stable fixed point which we denote @xmath21 .",
    "the green region @xmath22 $ ] is the set of initial conditions attracted to the middle stable fixed point which we denote @xmath23 .",
    "the blue region @xmath24 $ ] is the set of initial conditions attracted to the leftmost stable fixed point which we denote @xmath25 .    for @xmath1 ,",
    "each of these colored sets has infinitely many disjoint intervals and a fractal boundary . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the leftmost stable fixed point @xmath25 is destroyed via a saddle - node bifurcation on the fractal basin boundary .",
    "in fact , in this case , for @xmath26 , every boundary point of one basin is a boundary point for all three basins .",
    "( that is , an arbitrarily small @xmath7-interval centered about any point on the boundary of any one of the basins contains pieces of the other two basins . )",
    "the basins are so - called wada basins @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon of a saddle - node bifurcation on the fractal boundary of wada basins also occurs for the damped forced oscillators studied in refs .",
    "alternatively , if we look at the saddle - node bifurcation as @xmath0 decreases through the value @xmath5 , then the basin @xmath24 $ ] of the newly created stable fixed point immediately has infinitely many disjoint intervals and its boundary displays fractal structure . according to the terminology of robert et al .",
    "@xcite , we may consider this bifurcation an example of an ` explosion ' .",
    "figure 3 graphs the computed dimension @xmath27 of the fractal basin boundary versus the parameter @xmath0 . for @xmath1 , we observe that @xmath27 appears to be a continuous function of @xmath0 .",
    "park et al .",
    "@xcite argue that the fractal dimension of the basin boundary near @xmath5 , for @xmath1 , scales as @xmath28 with @xmath29 the dimension at @xmath2 ( @xmath29 is less than the dimension of the phase space ) , and @xmath30 a positive constant .",
    "figure 3 shows that the boundary dimension @xmath27 experiences a discontinuous jump at the saddle - node bifurcation when @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that the basin @xmath24 $ ] suddenly disappears for @xmath31 .",
    "the existence of a fractal basin boundary has important practical consequences .",
    "in particular , for the purpose of determining which attractor eventually captures a given orbit , the arbitrarily fine - scaled structure of fractal basin boundaries implies considerable sensitivity to small errors in initial conditions .",
    "if we assume that initial points can not be located more precisely than some @xmath32 , then we can not determine which basin a point is in , if it is within @xmath33 of the basin boundary .",
    "such points are called @xmath33-uncertain .",
    "the lebesgue measure of the set of @xmath33-uncertain points ( in a bounded region of interest ) scales like @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the dimension of the phase space ( @xmath36 for one dimensional maps ) and @xmath27 is the box - counting dimension of the basin boundary @xcite . for the case of a fractal basin boundary @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 is small , a large decrease in @xmath33 results in a relatively small decrease in @xmath34 .",
    "this is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which defines the uncertainty dimension , @xmath39 , as follows .",
    "say we randomly pick an initial condition @xmath7 with uniform probability density in a state - space region @xmath40 .",
    "then we randomly pick another initial condition @xmath41 in @xmath40 , such that @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the probability that @xmath7 and @xmath41 are in different basins .",
    "[ we can think of @xmath43 as the probability that an error will be made in determing the basin of an initial condition if the initial condition has uncertainty of size @xmath33 . ]",
    "the uncertainty dimension of the basin boundary @xmath39 is defined as the limit of @xmath44 as @xmath33 goes to zero @xcite .",
    "thus , the probability of error scales as @xmath45 , where for fractal basin boundaries @xmath46 .",
    "this indicates enhanced sensitivity to small uncertainty in initial conditions .",
    "for example , if @xmath47 , then a decrease of the initial condition uncertainty @xmath33 by a factor of 10 leads to only a relative small decrease in the final state uncertainty @xmath43 , since @xmath48 decreases by a factor of about @xmath49 .",
    "thus , in practical terms , it may be essentially impossible to significantly reduce the final state uncertainty . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was conjectured that the box - counting dimension equals the uncertainty dimension for basin boundaries in typical dynamical systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proven that the box - counting dimension , the uncertainty dimension and the hausdorff dimension are all equal for the basin boundaries of one and two dimensional systems that are uniformly hyperbolic on their basin boundary .",
    "we now explain some aspects of the character of the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath0 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "from refs .",
    "@xcite it follows that the box - counting dimension and the hausdorff dimension coincide for all intervals of @xmath0 for which the map @xmath8 is hyperbolic on the basin boundary , and that the dimension depends continuously on the parameter @xmath0 in these intervals . for @xmath50 , there are many parameter values for which the map has a saddle - node bifurcation of a periodic orbit on the fractal basin boundary . at such parameter values , which we refer to as saddle - node bifurcation parameter values ,",
    "the dimension is expected to be discontinuous ( as it is at the saddle - node bifurcation of the fixed point , @xmath2 , see fig .  3 ) .",
    "in fact , there exist sequences of saddle - node bifurcation parameter values converging to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for each parameter value @xmath50 for which the map undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation , there exists a sequence of saddle - node bifurcation parameter values converging to that parameter value .",
    "the basins of attraction of the periodic orbits created by saddle - node bifurcations of high period exist only for very small intervals of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we did not encounter them numerically by iterating initial conditions for a discrete set of values of the parameter @xmath0 , as we did for the basin of our fixed point attractor .",
    "just past @xmath5 , the remaining green and red basins display an alternating stripe structure [ see fig .  2(b ) ] .",
    "the red and green stripes are interlaced in a fractal structure .",
    "as we approach the bifurcation point , the interlacing becomes finer and finer scaled , with the scale approaching zero as @xmath0 approaches @xmath5 .",
    "similar fine scaled structure is present in the neighborhood of all preiterates of @xmath9 .",
    "if one changes the horizontal axis of figs .",
    "2(a , b ) from @xmath0 to @xmath51 , then , the complex alternating stripe structure appears asymptotically periodic [ see fig .",

    "for any given @xmath61 which is not on the fractal basin boundary , there exists a range of @xmath0 such that iterates of @xmath61 under @xmath8 evolve to the same final attractor , for all values of @xmath0 in that range .",
