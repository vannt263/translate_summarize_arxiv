    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relative contribution of dust at @xmath5  k is expected to be strongly dependent on the strength of the illuminating radiation field .",
    "consequently , the 24  @xmath0 m band is predicted to increase more rapidly than other infrared bands as the illuminating radiation field increases , as has been shown with many physical and semi - empirical models of dust emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "multiple studies with _ spitzer _ data have shown that the 24  @xmath0 m emission from point - like sources corresponds to hii regions visible in optical and ultraviolet wave bands , so the 24  @xmath0 m band may be used to measure star formation activity @xcite . extended 24  @xmath0 m emission , however , may originate from outside of star - forming regions in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the 160  @xmath0 m mips detector mainly traces cold ( @xmath6  k ) dust emission that may be associated with cirrus dust in the diffuse interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because the 160  @xmath0 m band samples dust emission near the peak of the spectral energy distribution in the galaxies in this sample @xcite , the 160  @xmath0 m band should be tightly correlated with the total infrared ( tir ) luminosity .",

    "a description of the technique is presented in @xcite .",
    "the final images may contain residual background emission from the telescope or sky that is subtracted during the analysis .",
    "the mips data were processed using the mips data analysis tools version 3.06 @xcite .",

    "we therefore limit the sample to spiral galaxies in sings where the major axes of the d@xmath20 isophote specified by @xcite are larger than 5  arcmin . since we want to be able to distinguish between radial colour variations and colour variations related to the presence of substructures and since such substructures are difficult to study in edge - on galaxies , we only use galaxies that are inclined less than @xmath21 .",
    "the inclinations are calculated using @xmath22 the value @xmath23 is the observed ( projected ) minor - to - major axis ratio .",
    "the value @xmath24 is the intrinsic optical axial ratio ( the ratio of the unprojected optical axis perpendicular the plane of the galaxy to the diameter of the disc ) , which is equivalent to 0.20 for most disc galaxies @xcite .",

    "two very bright foreground stars in the 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath0 m images of ngc  3621 cause problems in the analysis , so ngc  3621 needs to be excluded from the sample as well .",

    "+    additionally , differences between the nature of 15 and 24  @xmath0 m dust emission could have also contributed to the differences between the 7  @xmath0m/15  @xmath0 m relation observed with iso and the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m relation observed with _",

    "consequently , a comparison of pah to 24  @xmath0 m data should exhibit more scatter than a comparison of pah to 15  @xmath0 m data .",
    "we also found that differences in the distribution of star - forming regions within galaxies could influence how the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio varies with 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness . in some galaxies , such as ngc  3351 and ngc  6946",
    ", the nucleus is the strongest site of star formation .",
    "hence , the location expected to have the lowest ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio will correspond to the location with the highest 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness , so the data will show that the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio decreases as the 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness increases , thus varying as expected from many models of dust emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other galaxies , such as ngc  925 and ngc  2403 , the nucleus is not the site of the strongest star formation activity , and many hii regions can be found at the periphery of the regions that were detected at the @xmath27 level in these data . while point - like 24  @xmath0 m sources should correspond to hii regions @xcite , dust emission models such as those presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that diffuse 24  @xmath0 m dust emission may still potentially originate from regions outside star - forming regions with high radiation fields . furthermore ,",
    "ionising photons may escape from star - forming regions into the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite , and results from @xcite suggest that 24  @xmath0 m emission may trace the recombination line emission from the diffuse gas heated by these photons .",
    "hence , it is possible that the infrared - brightest regions in the centres of some galaxies may contain a higher fraction of 24  @xmath0 m emission from diffuse dust than the infrared - faint regions , so the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio will increase as the 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness increases , as can be seen for ngc  925 and ngc  2403 in figure  [ f_pahvs24 ] .",
    "several mechanisms may be responsible for creating the differences in the spatial distribution of the pah 8 and 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "first , as the illuminating radiation field increases , the 24  @xmath0 m band is thought to increase more rapidly than bands that trace pah emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 24  @xmath0 m emission may be more strongly enhanced than the pah emission in regions with very high radiation fields , such as star - forming regions .",
    "second , the pahs may be destroyed in regions with strong radiation fields or in regions with large numbers of high - energy photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the pahs would be absent , and the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio would be low in the centres of star - forming regions and agn .",
    "third , the ratio of the 7.7  @xmath0 m pah feature to other pah features may vary with changes in the charge state of the pahs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this could occur in hii regions if the electron densities are high enough that recombination rates becomes significant compared to photoionisation rates , which would lead to a reduction of the pah@xmath28 ions that produce the 7.7  @xmath0 m emission @xcite .    while the enhancement of 24  @xmath0 m emission linked to dust heating in star - forming regions is certainly at least part of the reason why the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio varies",
    ", we argue that the variations must also be caused in part by a reduction in pah emission in the 8  @xmath0 m band through either pah destruction or changes in the relative strengths of pah spectral features .",
    "models of dust emission have suggested that , if pahs are present and radiating at 8  @xmath0 m , the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio would be enhanced in regions with very strong radiation fields , warmer dust , and low ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratios @xcite .",
    "however , the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio does not peak within individual star - forming regions where local minima in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio are found , such as the bright extranuclear regions in ngc  2403 , ngc  3184 , and ngc  3938 .",
    "this is best demonstrated by comparisons of the maps of ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m and ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratios at matching resolutions in figure  [ f_map_conv160comp ] , although the additional discussion in section  [ s_comp_pah160 ] and the maps in figure  [ f_map ] also support this conclusion .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ f_pah160vs24160 ] demonstrates that the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratios are not always higher in regions with strongly enhanced 24  @xmath0 m emission . according to the models of @xcite ,",
    "the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m should monotonically increase with the 24  @xmath0m/160  @xmath0 m ratio in these regions if pahs are present and if the pah ionisation does not change .",
    "these results indicate that the variations in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio must be in part caused by the suppression of pah 8  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "observations of individual hii regions within the milky way have shown that the pah emission may be found primarily in shell - like structures around the star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the strength of all pah spectral features relative to 24  @xmath0 m hot dust emission decreases within the centres of hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if these results are applicable to the galaxies in this paper , then the inferred decrease in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio within star - forming regions may also be partly caused by pah destruction and not just variations in the strengths of pah spectral features .",
    "further work with mid - infrared spectroscopic observations of star - forming regions within these galaxies , specifically studies of how the total emission in all pah spectral feature emission varies with respect to total dust emission , would be needed to confirm that pah destruction is taking place .",
    "although the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission does not share a one - to - one correspondence with 24  @xmath0 m emission or with other star formation tracers on kiloparsec scales , this does not necessarily preclude its use as a tracer of integrated star formation within nearby spiral galaxies . the variations between pah 8  @xmath0 m emission and other star formation tracers could potentially be averaged out when integrating across the optical discs of spiral galaxies . however , because a significant fraction of the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission still originates from the diffuse ism , it would not be as reliable as other global star formation tracers . furthermore , because the ratio of pah to tir flux and the ratio of pah to 24  @xmath0 m flux density varies with metallicity @xcite , a conversion factor relating integrated pah 8  @xmath0 m emission to star formation may also vary with global metallicity .",
    "we also note that variations in metallicity could possibly produce variations in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio observed in the galaxies studied in this paper , but these variations would not be expected to cause the differences in the ratio between star - forming regions and the diffuse ism observed here .",
    "moreover , the gas - phase abundances of the galaxies in our sample are well above 12+log(o / h)@xmath298 - 8.1 , where pah 8  @xmath0 m emission should be suppressed as determined by @xcite and @xcite , although ngc  628 , ngc  925 , ngc  2403 , and ngc  3031 all have characteristic abundances close to this value and might be affected . to examine this issue further , we compared the radial gradients in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio to the radial gradients in 12+log(o / h ) measured by j. moustakas et al .",

    "the relation between these two radial gradients can be seen in figure  [ f_gradcomp_pah24_12logoh ] . if the variations in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio depended primarily on metallicity variations , then we would expect to see a correlation between the gradients in figure  [ f_gradcomp_pah24_12logoh ] . however , the two gradients appear uncorrelated , which indicates that the variations in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio that have been observed here depend primarily on effects unrelated to metallicity .",
    "this conclusion for these spiral galaxies is also consistent with the results presented for the spiral galaxy m101 by @xcite , who found that pah equivalent widths appeared more dependent on the ionisation of the ism ( characterised using [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ siv]/[siii ] ) than 12+log(o / h ) .",
    "the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio appears to be closely correlated with the 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness measured on 45  arcsec scales in most galaxies , even in nearby galaxies where this angular scale corresponds to @xmath4  kpc .",
    "moreover , the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio sometimes traces high surface brightness large scale structures in the discs of these galaxies , such as the spiral arms in ngc  3031 or ngc  6946 .",
    "this indicates that the variations in the ratio may not be primarily dependent on radius as inferred by @xcite but instead may be primarily dependent on the 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "however , the large scale structures within these galaxies are only marginally resolved in the 160  @xmath0 m data .",
    "higher resolution observations at wavelengths longer than 100  @xmath0 m are needed to confirm that this interpretation is valid .",
    "nonetheless , if the above interpretation is correct , then it also suggests that the variations in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio may be more dependent on 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness than metallicity within the regions studied in these galaxies . since variations in metallicity have been linked to decreased pah emission relative to longer - wavelength dust emission in the integrated spectra of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "( 2008 , in preparation ) calculated with the @xcite calibration . for this comparison , we excluded ngc  4725 because the gradients in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio changes significantly between the nucleus and the outer disc , and we excluded ngc  3938 and ngc  4579 because abundance gradients are not given by j. moustakas et al .",

    "if the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio was affected by metallicity in the regions studied in these galaxies , then these data would be positively correlated .",
    "since the data in figure  [ f_gradcomp_pah160_12logoh ] do not exhibit such a correlation , the two gradients may be unrelated .",
    "we therefore conclude that , in the regions of the galaxies studied here , metallicity variations are not as important as 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness variations in determining the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio , although metallicity may be a factor outside the optical discs . again",
    ", this is consistent with the conclusions reached by @xcite , who found that pah equivalent widths in m101 were more dependent on the ionisation of the ism than abundances .",
    "while the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio traces large scale structure , we have demonstrated that the ratio is not enhanced within individual star - forming regions , and we explained earlier in this section that pah 8  @xmath0 m emission must be inhibited in regions with strong radiation fields . based on these conclusions and the strong relation between the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio and 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness",
    ", we infer that the pahs in these galaxies are generally associated with the cold ( @xmath6  k ) dust that dominates the 160  @xmath0 m emission , at least on scales of @xmath1  kpc .",
    "because most of this cold dust may be expected to be found in the diffuse ism , the pahs may also be found primarily in the diffuse ism as well , although some of the cold dust and pahs may also be found within clouds associated with star - forming regions . moreover , since the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio increases as the 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness increases , the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio may be an indicator of variations in the intensity of the radiation field heating the diffuse ism .",
    "this is further supported by the tight correlation between the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio and the 24  @xmath0m/160  @xmath0 m ratio found for many regions with weak 24  @xmath0 m emission in figure  [ f_pah160vs24160 ] , which are presumably regions that primarily sample dust emission from the diffuse ism .",
    "nonetheless , this interpretation is only valid if the pah mass fraction does not vary appreciably between infrared - faint and infrared - bright regions in the diffuse ism , and far - infrared observations with higher angular resolution will be needed to determine whether this association is still applicable on smaller spatial scales .    in most galaxies in this sample , the variation in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio with 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness is purely driven by the decrease in 160  @xmath0 m emission relative to tir emission , as the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/tir ratio remains constant with tir surface brightness . in a few exceptions , however , a decline in the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission relative to tir emission is also partly responsible for the observed variations .",
    "this reduction of pah emission may occur if the fraction of starlight from evolved red stars increases as the 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness decreases . in this scenario ,",
    "the photons in the illuminating radiation field would have reduced energies , and the peak temperatures attained by pahs following the absorpiton of single photons would be reduced .",
    "consequently , the pahs would tend to radiate at longer wavelengths , and the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio would appear to decrease .",
    "we also noted that the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio drops within the high surface brightness centre of some galaxies within this sample .",
    "a couple of mechanisms could be responsible for this phenomenon .",
    "first , agn may be responsible for inhibiting the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission either by changing the ionisation state of the pahs or by destroying the pahs .",
    "this was also suggested by @xcite , who showed that the 7.7  @xmath0 m pah spectral feature was suppressed within the centres of sings galaxies with low luminosity agn .",
    "many of the galaxies we observed with suppressed ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratios in their centres are objects that are classified as containing agn , although ngc  3184 is a notable exception .",
    "another possibility is that the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio drops in regions where a significant fraction of the interstellar radiation field originates from evolved bulge stars .",
    "as explained above , pahs may not be heated as strongly by single photons in such radiation fields , and therefore 7.7  @xmath0 m emission will be inhibited .",
    "we have shown that the relation between pah 8 and 24  @xmath0 m emission in this sample of spiral galaxies exhibit significant scatter on scales of @xmath1  kpc .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission is relatively weak compared to 24  @xmath0 m emission in star - forming regions , but the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission is relatively strong in the diffuse ism . in some cases ,",
    "the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio may exhibit variations greater than a factor of 2 at a given 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "we argue that two mechanisms are responsible for these variations : enhancements in the 24  @xmath0 m emission relative to pah emission in regions with very strong radiation fields with high - energy photons and the corresponding reduction of pah 8  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "we have also shown that the pah 8  @xmath0 m emission is associated with 160  @xmath0 m emission on scales of @xmath1  kpc within these spiral galaxies and that the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio appears to be a function of 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "the scatter in the relation is only at the 10%-20% level for a given surface brightness , and the intrinsic scatter measured in the relation between the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio and 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness is notably lower than for the relation between the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/24  @xmath0 m ratio and 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "while the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio appears to decrease monotonically with radius in some galaxies , the presence of peaks in the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio corresponding to large scale structure indicates that surface brightness may be a more important factor , and statistical tests of the best fit lines between the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio and either 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness or radius showed that the dependence with 160  @xmath0 m surface brightness was more significant . the strong correlation between the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio and 160  @xmath0 m emission and the results from the comparison of pah 8 and 24  @xmath0 m emission suggest that most of the pahs are located in the diffuse interstellar medium with the dust grains that produce the majority of the 160  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "we therefore suggest that the ( pah 8  @xmath0m)/160  @xmath0 m ratio may be indicative of the intensity of the interstellar radiation field that heats the diffuse interstellar dust in these galaxies .",
    "the results here indicate that pah emission should be used very cautiously as a tracer of star formation on kiloparsec scales if it should be used at all . instead , the pah emission may be more indicative of the distribution of diffuse dust within nearby galaxies , although pah emission still may be affected by metallicity @xcite , and the results here suggest that pah emission might be inhibited in the diffuse ism if the radiation field is very high .",
    "follow - up observations with the herschel space observatory and the james clerk maxwell telescope will allow for studying the correlation between pah and @xmath6  k dust emission on smaller spatial scales in nearby galaxies , thus placing further constraints on the relation between pahs and cool dust .",
