    "in recent years , the dynamics of steps of monoatomic height on crystal surfaces has attracted much interest , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "experimentally , fluctuations of isolated steps as well as trains of steps on vicinal surfaces have been studied thoroughly @xcite .",
    "+ theoretically , three distinct mechanisms driving the step fluctuations have been identified , step diffusion , evaporation  condensation and terrace diffusion .",
    "predictions of langevin descriptions @xcite have been checked , confirmed , and extended in monte carlo simulations on discrete sos models @xcite .",
    "recently , extensive simulations on step diffusion and evaporation  condensation have been performed , for isolated and pairs of ascending steps @xcite . here , results of a related study on terrace diffusion will be presented .",
    "+ of course , the roughness of the surface crucially influences the step dynamics . _ below _ the roughening transition temperature , @xmath1 , the surface is smooth .",
    "terrace diffusion may now be described in different ways . in an idealized description ,",
    "the elementary move consists of the detachment of a step atom , followed by its random walk on the perfectly flat terrace , and the final attachment of the atom at the same or neighbouring step .",
    "this description may be simplified further by assuming that the time of the random walk may be neglected compared to that of the step processes .",
    "more realistically , terrace diffusion results from jumps of each surface atom to neighbouring sites .",
    "this type of kinetics is usually called surface diffusion , and , in the following , only the idealized kind of kinetics will be called terrace diffusion . obviously , step positions are uniquely defined for terrace , but not for surface diffusion .",
    "one of the aims of the present monte carlo study is to compare simulational data , in the framework of sos models , for terrace diffusion and surface diffusion .",
    "+ _ above _ the roughening transition , steps are definitely no longer microscopically well defined ; so the analysis will be restricted to surface diffusion .",
    "one may study the evolution of the profile of initially straight steps .",
    "indeed , the corresponding equilibration problem , at @xmath2 , has been described by mullins many years ago @xcite , and we shall compare our monte carlo findings to that classical theory . likewise , some of our findings at @xmath1 may be compared not only to langevin theories on step fluctuations but also to theories on the equilibration of surface profiles @xcite .",
    "+ the article is organized accordingly , presenting first our results on isolated and pairs of ascending steps below roughening , and then those on steps above roughening .",
    "we simulate square surfaces with isolated and pairs of steps of monoatomic height .",
    "initially , at time @xmath3 = 0 , the steps are perfectly straight , and the bordering terraces are perfectly flat ; pairs of steps are usually separated by at most one lattice spacing .",
    "step fluctuations result from terrace or surface diffusion .",
    "+ in case of terrace diffusion , the acceptance rates of detaching and attaching atoms at steps , with a random walk in between , is assumed to be given by the boltzmann factor of the change in the kink energies as described by the one  dimensional sos model . there",
    "the kink energy is proportional to the number of missing bonds to the neighbouring step sites , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the position of step @xmath6 , ( @xmath6=1 , 2 ) , at site @xmath7 . the time unit , one monte carlo step ( mcs ) , is assigned to @xmath8 ( or 2@xmath8 ) attempted elementary moves for isolated ( pairs of ) steps of length @xmath8 . in case of pairs of steps",
    "no crossing of steps is allowed.to speed up simulations , one may replace the actual random walk by a probability distribution @xcite . + in case of surface diffusion , the acceptance rates for jumps of surface atoms to neighbouring sites will be given by the boltzmann factor of the corresponding energy change of the two  dimensional sos model , where the local energy is given by @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being neighbouring surface sites . the roughening transition is known to occur at @xmath12 .",
    "the time unit , one mcs , is assigned to @xmath13 attempted jumps , where @xmath8 is the step length , say , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 refers to the other direction of the surface . to monitor the step fluctuations , we recorded the step profile , @xmath16 = @xmath17 , summing over @xmath18 and averaging over @xmath19 monte carlo realizations with different random numbers .",
    "to stabilize the steps , the heights at the boundary lines parallel to the initial straight steps are kept constant during the simulation , e.g. for pairs of steps at @xmath20=0 and @xmath20=2 .",
    "+ the step dynamics may be described , both for surface and terrace diffusion , by the time evolution of the step profile @xmath16 , and , for terrace diffusion , by the average step positions , @xmath21 , and the fluctuation function @xmath22 , averaging over step sites and realizations .",
    "+    typical step profiles , for isolated and pairs of steps , are depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "to analyse their scaling behaviour , we use the ansatz @xmath23 . at a given height , @xmath24 ,",
    "one may yield at each time , by interpolation , the corresponding distance @xmath25 , and thence , setting @xmath26 , one may obtain an effective exponent @xmath27 .",
    "of course , full scaling holds only when @xmath28 eventually becomes independent of time @xmath3 and @xmath29 .",
    "+ indeed , for rather long steps , of at least a few hundred sites , terrace diffusion and surface diffusion lead to consistent monte carlo results on the effective exponent @xmath28 .",
    "most of the simulations were done at @xmath30= 1.0 and 0.8 for surface diffusion and at 1.0 for terrace diffusion . + for pairs of steps , in case of terrace and surface diffusion , the effective exponent @xmath28 is observed to approach 1/5 at large times of up to several @xmath31 mcs ( well before the step fluctuations saturate due to the finite step length ) , when @xmath29 approaches 0 or 2 . for reasons of symmetry , one may restrict the discussion to @xmath32 . at those times ,",
    "say , @xmath33 ( mcs ) , applying terrace diffusion , the separation distance between the steps , @xmath34 , and the fluctuations @xmath35 follow closely the power  law @xmath36",
    ". however , in that time regime , for terrace and surface diffusion , the effective exponent @xmath28 changes significantly with @xmath29 , increasing with @xmath29 from about 1/5 at small heights rather slowly up to about @xmath37 at @xmath38 , and then more rapidly to roughly 1/3 as @xmath29 approaches 1 , depending only weakly on time .",
    "it remains to be seen whether full scaling of the step profile , with , possibly , @xmath39 , holds in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "note that the continuum theory of spohn on the equilbration of steps due to surface diffusion @xcite does not provide an easy answer to this question .",
    "there the oscillatory character of the profile is emphasized , which may affect the scaling behaviour . in fact , oscillations show up , but with very small amplitudes ; see fig . 1 and next section.",
    "the value 1/5 for the exponent describing the separation of the two steps , @xmath41 , has been argued before to follow from the continuum theory of rettori and villain @xcite .",
    "+ terrace diffusion for pairs of short steps may be described , in the limit @xmath42 , by two points on a line emitting particles which execute one  dimensional random walks .",
    "when the emitted particle returns to the emitter , that point will stay at its original position , while the other point will move by one when the particle hits that point .",
    "the description may also be applicable to the motion of a pair of kinks along a smooth step in the case of step  edge diffusion when there are only those two kinks . from our simulations of such random walks",
    ", we infer that the distance @xmath43 between the two steps of length @xmath44 ( or the two kinks ) increases as @xmath45 at large times . + for isolated long steps ,",
    "the step profiles tend to scale , at sufficiently large times , with @xmath46 , for surface diffusion as well as for terrace diffusion .",
    "indeed , the critical exponent of the power  law describing the step fluctuations @xmath47 at those times is about 1/6 as well , in accordance with previous simulations for terrace diffusion @xcite .",
    "that result confirms the validity of langevin descriptions for step dynamics at late stages @xcite .",
    "we studied isolated and pairs of ascending steps in the framework of two  dimensional sos models at @xmath2 , or one  dimensional sos models , which are rough at all temperatures @xmath48 , computing the step profiles @xmath16 , applying surface diffusion .",
    "all cases lead to similar results , because above roughening individual steps are smeared out completely .",
    "+ in particular , the step profiles scale , already at moderate times of typically a few @xmath49 mcs , with the critical exponent @xmath50 , the effective exponent @xmath28 depending only very weakly on @xmath29 .",
    "the profiles show oscillations , with the amplitude decreasing rapidly with distance from the center of the surface , see fig .",
    "the onset of the oscillations may be readily understood by calculating the energetics of the first few excitations , starting from flat terraces and straight steps .",
    "already the first move leads to an overshooting of the profile at the next ",
    "nearest distance from the center , @xmath51 = 0 , which again triggers an undershooting at further distance , and so on .",
    "this effect has been described before by mullins in a continuum theory of surface equilibration above roughening @xcite .",
    "note that the oscillations persist to temperatures below roughening , as discussed above ; however , the amplitudes become much smaller , at least at the times used in our monte carlo study , see also fig .",
    "+    in mullins theory , the basic equation reads @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a temperature dependent coefficient ; the continuum variable @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath51 in the discrete description .",
    "the equation may easily be solved by fourier analysis @xcite .",
    "the resulting step profiles resemble closely those found in the simulations ; differences are expected to show up only at early stages of equilibration , as observed before for other surface defects such as periodic grooves @xcite . from the basic equation , it follows that the amplitudes of the oscillations settle at fixed values , independent of temperature .",
    "we confirmed these features by simulating steps at various temperatures .",
    "actually , the continuum description of mullins leads to a perfect scaling of the step profiles with @xmath55 .",
