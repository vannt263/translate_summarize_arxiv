    "all experimental data seem to be fully consistent with the standard model with 3 fermion generations ( sm3 ) .",
    "it is truly remarkable that sm3 could account for a very wide range of data .",
    "not only lep precision tests fail to reveal new effects ( except @xmath1@xmath2 , see below ) , the flavor related parameters such as @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the cp violating phase in sm3 ) could numerically account for subtle effects such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "remarkable as it is , we should recognize that , ",
    "accounting \" is one thing , but a deeper  understanding \" ( _ e.g. _ gauge invariance as a dynamical principle ) of all this is still lacking . to gain some perspective on the parameters of sm3 , note that -0.01 cm    [ cols=\"^,>,<,^,^ , < \" , ]     0.2 cm in all , out of 18 parameters are in flavor sector .",
    "furthermore , this number could easily multiply if more fermions are discovered .",
    "if gauge couplings @xmath13 are basically understood , while symmetry breaking is partially understood , in comparison , flavor is not understood ! this constitutes the flavor problem .",
    "many questions are contained here :    * why 3 ? * why mass and mixing hierarchies ? *",
    "why @xmath14 ? * for weak bosons and the top quark , @xmath0 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this appears to be natural since it is  normal \" to expect particles to have mass of order the dynamical scale ( e.g. hadrons in qcd ) .",
    "the mystery is then , why all fermions ( except the top ) behave as @xmath18 ?",
    "they appear more like zero modes at the weak scale ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    together with our limited understanding of symmetry breaking ,",
    "the last point suggest that one could well have more states around the weak scale @xmath19",
    ". these could be the 4th generation ( sm4 ) fermions , extra higgs bosons , or the appearance of exotic ( nonsequential ) fermions .",
    "what do we know about them ?",
    "perhaps the discovery of new particles at the @xmath19 scale may provide us with better understanding of the flavor problem .",
    "it is useful to remind ourselves the hard facts at hand :    * a heavy quark weighing 180 gev has been found during 1994 - 95 @xcite . however , _",
    "it is not yet proven to be the top _ , since most heavy quark decay scenarios contain @xmath20 final states .",
    "it could well be the 4th generation @xmath21 or @xmath22 quark , or some exotic quark .",
    "* if a 4th generation exists ( call it @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , then @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "* by same token , there is a firm lower bound of @xmath27 for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , the limit of @xmath31 gev from ",
    "@xmath32 \" measurement by cdf is not firm since it assumes @xmath33 .",
    "the 1989 - 91 limit of @xmath34 gev by cdf and 1994 limit of @xmath35 gev by d0 are not firm because the sm3 value of br@xmath36 is assumed .    our theme ,",
    "therefore , is that heavy quarks ( @xmath37 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or exotics ) could lurk / hide below @xmath0 if hadronic decays predominate the decay rate @xcite .",
    "the existence of a heavy quark @xmath38 with @xmath39 , together with the observed heavy quark @xmath40 with @xmath41 gev , imply that there would be a lot of fun ahead of us at both the tevatron and lep ii .",
    "as an illustration of how the tevatron experiments could have missed heavy quarks with @xmath42 , let us discuss the case for a  light \" top quark @xcite .",
    "we define the top quark as the doublet partner of the @xmath20 quark . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the sm3 decay chain is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is virtual ( see fig .",
    "this process is suppressed by a propagator and coupling factor @xmath46 ( i.e. still  remembering \" 4-fermi interaction ) as well as 3-body phase space . if some boson @xmath47 exist and couples to @xmath37-@xmath48 quarks with strength @xmath49 , then , if @xmath50 , this induces a 2-body decay . if @xmath49 is not too small compared to @xmath51 ( the weak gauge coupling ) , and if @xmath52 hadrons ( on - shell @xmath47 decay ) , then top decay could be dominated by hadronic final states due to @xmath47 production , and it would be difficult for cdf / d0 to tell from multijet background . note that this can not occur in sm3 , since @xmath53 coupling does not exist .",
    "however , @xmath47 could be exotic scalars such as @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "these could arise from minimal susy ( mssm ) , where the scalars could also be the top squark @xmath56 while @xmath48 above becomes the chargino @xmath57 or neutralino @xmath58 .",
    "the simplest construction , however , would be the addition of an extra scalar doublet . in the following ,",
    "we shall mainly use two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) as a means of illustration , before turning to more elaborate models . for sake of space",
    ", we touch on salient features without giving any detail .",
    "the  standard \" 2hdms invoke the natural flavor conservation condition ( nfc ) of glashow and weinberg , where each type of fermion charge receive mass from one higgs doublet only .",
    "the mass and yukawa matrices are then simultaneously diagonized , and fcnc couplings of neutral scalars are absent by construction .",
    "for model i , both @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks receive mass from the same doublet , while for model ii , they receive mass from different doublets . the latter is popular because it naturally arises in mssm , and has been rather well studied .",
    "it is possible to foresake the nfc condition by assuming some approximate ( global ) flavor symmetry in the yukawa couplings to protect from low energy fcnc constraints .",
    "this was noted already some time ago @xcite , and has been discussed widely recently .",
    "let us see how a light top could be hidden in these models .      in this model ,",
    "the @xmath54 coupling is @xmath62 where the parameter @xmath63 is mainly constrained by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the coupling could evade the stringent @xmath12 constraint by a cancellation mechanism between @xmath54 and @xmath64 effects @xcite .",
    "it evades direct cdf search for @xmath61 as follows .",
    "cdf finds @xcite that if @xmath65 is close to 100% , the entire region of @xmath66 is ruled out .",
    "however , if it falls below 50% , then the entire region becomes allowed ! in model",
    "i , since @xmath67 one has br@xmath68 30% .",
    "what is the @xmath69 coupling strength ?",
    "one sees from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that @xmath70 . from @xmath12 one",
    "infers that @xmath71 , while @xmath72 for this mass range .",
    "we thus find @xcite that @xmath73 ",
    "@xmath74 , hence , @xmath75 in the mass range of @xmath66 .      in this case one",
    "replaces @xmath76 by @xmath77 in the coefficient of the @xmath78 term .",
    "this makes all the difference compared to model i. the @xmath54 contribution now adds constructively to the @xmath79 boson contribution ( as well as the large qcd correction term that arises at leading log ( ll ) order ) .",
    "what is interesting @xcite is the appearance of a _",
    "@xmath80-independent _ term that contributes for any @xmath80 value .",
    "this amounts to a strong enhancement effect that is always there , leading to a stringent constraint from the observation of @xmath12 and @xmath81 by cleo .",
    "the upshot , as stated by cleo @xcite , is that @xmath82 gev .    at ll order ,",
    "one has significant scale dependence , which is supposedly resolved at next - to - leading ( nll ) order .",
    "such a calculation is rather tedious and intricate .",
    "a partial calculation suggests that new cancellation effects emerge at nll order .",
    "the details can not be presented here @xcite , but depending on the sign of new nll terms , it may be possible to evade @xmath12 bound for @xmath43 and @xmath83 . at the same time , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) gets multiplied by @xmath84 .",
    "thus , one needs @xmath85 to evade cdf direct search for @xmath61 .",
    "the upshot , then , is that @xmath86 is in fact possible if @xmath87 , which is a value where the distinction between model i and ii are blurred .      without nfc condition ,",
    "in general one has fcnc neutral higgs boson couplings at tree level",
    ". however , nature seems to have  naturally \" implemented some approximate flavor symmetry , which is reflected in the mass and mixing hierarchies .",
    "this suggests @xcite that low energy fcnc constraints could still be effectively evaded , _ without _ constraining the high energy behavior . the basic observation here",
    "then is that @xcite , there is in fact almost no _ direct _ constraint that forbids fcnc @xmath37-@xmath89-scalar couplings .",
    "it is not against any principle or experimental result @xcite . assuming that some fcnc neutral scalar @xmath55 is rather light , but still decaying via @xmath90 , then @xmath88 ( followed by @xmath91 ) decay provides a somewhat exotic but otherwise perfectly possible scenario where @xmath43",
    "could be realized @xcite .",
    "another way to induce fcnc is to break gim mechanism .",
    "the easiest way beyond sm3 is the addition of left - right singlet charge 2/3 quarks @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which affects top physics via @xmath37-@xmath40 mixing .",
    "one can show @xcite that physical @xmath94 and @xmath95 eigenvalues could remain small even with large @xmath59-@xmath40 and @xmath89-@xmath40 mixings . since @xmath53 coupling is induced by the presence of _ both _ @xmath89-@xmath40 and @xmath37-@xmath40 mixings , to allow @xmath96 decay to dominate over @xmath97 one needs both mixings to be very large .",
    "however , on closer inspection , one would find that too large a @xmath89-@xmath40 mixing would lead to too small a @xmath98 coupling .",
    "interestingly , it has recently been reported that the @xmath98 coupling is 2.5@xmath99 below sm3 expectations , while @xmath100 coupling seems to be almost 4@xmath99 above . taking these experimental indications as hints , it is possible to construct @xcite a solution to the so - called @xmath1  @xmath2 problem ( the only seeming discrepancy with sm3 in town ) in this context , at the price of introducing a second higgs doublet .",
    "the latter provides for additional weak doublet splitting ( @xmath101 ) via @xmath102 , while the exotic neutral higgs @xmath55should be as light as possible to allow maximal phase space for facilitating the hiding of the actual top quark below @xmath0 .",
    "the dominantly singlet quark @xmath40 emerges as the heavy quark observed at the tevatron .",
    "it still dominantly decays via @xmath103 mode , but also decays via @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , with many interesting consequences @xcite .",
    "the scenario bears some similarity with , but is also distinct from , the mssm solutions to the @xmath1 ( but not @xmath2 ) problem , where one demands light  stop \" and chargino / neutralinos .",
    "some recent work illustrates that a fourth generation could be entertained from a high scale perspective .",
    "elaborate studies have been conducted with susy gut inspired structures .",
    "for example , the work of gunion , mckay and pois @xcite takes top ( partner of @xmath20 ) to be the quark discovered at tevatron .",
    "they then demonstrate that it is possible to have @xmath109 gev , where both heavy quarks remain unobserved if @xmath110 , where @xmath45 decay is rather soft , while @xmath21 decays via loop induced @xmath111 mode @xcite .",
    "the discussion is rather elaborate , but the point , to some extent , is to allow for a fourth generation but also at the price of additional  light \" new particles , which are again charged or neutral scalar bosons . in a similar framework ,",
    "the work of carena , haber and wagner @xcite suggests that @xmath112 via neutralino induced decays @xmath113 ( while @xmath114 ) .",
    "the fourth generation @xmath22 quark decays via standard @xmath103 channel and is the one observed at tevatron .",
    "one again has light new particles below @xmath0",
    ".    it may be worthwhile to strip ourselves from high scale prejudices and reassess the issue of possible physics of a fourth generation at tevatron and lep ii .",
    "we have seen many scenarios where one may have particles below the @xmath79 scale . in all cases",
    "one needs some light scalar particle to facilitate their hiding .",
    "we conclude that  light \" heavy quarks , below @xmath0 , or at least below @xmath28 , is quite an open topic for experimental study .",
