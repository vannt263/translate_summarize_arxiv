    "figure [ fig : gicond]b shows the results .",
    "we find that the occurrence of the gi barely depends on @xmath7 .",

    "the gi occurs for @xmath111 .    in all the cases where the dust evolution leads to the gi in figure [ fig : gicond ] , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are satisfied if the dust aggregates evolve by the self - gravitational compression .",
    "thus the gi is inevitable on the course of dust evolution for the above disk conditions .",
    "we derive the condition for the existence of the gi region as a function of disk parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : source ] , on the lower left boundary of the gi region , the main heating mechanism is turbulent stirring and the main cooling mechanism is collisional damping .",
    "thus , we calculate @xmath28 from @xmath114 assuming @xmath115 and @xmath116 and neglecting gravitational focusing .",
    "we obtain the condition for @xmath117 as @xmath118    on the upper right boundary of the gi region , the main heating source is turbulent scattering and the main cooling source is collisional damping .",
    "thus , we calculate @xmath28 from @xmath119 .",
    "the condition for the gi in this regime is @xmath120    as shown in figure [ fig : source ] , these two conditions agree well with the numerical results .",
    "thus , the necessary condition for the existence of the gi region is @xmath121 . from this , we derive the critical @xmath66 as @xmath122 using the disk model , we rewrite @xmath123 as @xmath124 where we adopt @xmath125 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath123 on @xmath7 is very weak .",

    "we plot @xmath123 in figure [ fig : gicond ] , which agrees well with the numerical results .",
    "the sufficient condition for the gi is that the dust evolution track crosses the gi region .",
