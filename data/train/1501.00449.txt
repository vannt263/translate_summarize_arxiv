    "the phase structure of quark matter on finite temperature and density has actively been studied for decades  @xcite . under usual condition , meaning low temperature and density , quarks are confined inside hadrons and they never be able to observed as a single particle . on the other hand , due to the nature of the asymptotic freedom  @xcite , quarks and gluons can be free from the confinement at high temperature and density , because the coupling strength becomes weak at high energy .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that quark matter undergoes the confined / deconfined phase transition at some temperature and density .",
    "this is important subject both in theoretical and experimental studies since it crucially relates to the quark matter properties at relativistically high energy collisions and extremely dense stellar objects such as neutron stars .",
    "the first principle for quarks and gluons is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is a non - abelian gauge field theory for fermions .",
    "our goals is to evaluate the phase structure based on this first principle qcd , however , it is difficult to extract theoretical predictions due to the nature of complicated strongly interacting system .",
    "one of the most reliable approaches is to use the discretised version of qcd called the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) in which theoretical calculation is performed on the discrete spacetime  @xcite .",
    "although the lqcd works well at finite temperature @xmath0 for small chemical potential @xmath1 , there is the technical difficulty called the  sign problem \" when one tries to investigate the system at intermediate chemical potential .",
    "there effective models maybe nicely adopted because some models can consistently treat the system at finite temperature and chemical potential .    for the sake of evaluating the phase structure of quark matter at finite temperature and chemical potential , we will employ the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite which is the most frequently used one in this context ( there are a lot of nice review papers on the model , see , e.g.  @xcite . ) the model is constructed by incorporating the four point quark interaction into the model lagrangian , so it is not renormalizable due to this higher dimensional operator .",
    "therefore , the physical predictions of the model inevitably depend on the regularization procedure and the model parameters chosen .",
    "the resulting phase diagram on the @xmath2 plane is as well affected by the parameters and regularization prescriptions .",
    "so it is an important issue to study whether the phase structure obtained in one regularization method is consistent with the ones from different regularization methods .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to study the phase structure of quark matter in the njl model with various regularization ways , which are three dimensional ( @xmath3d ) momentum cutoff , four dimensional ( @xmath4d ) momentum cutoff , pauli - villars ( pv ) regularization , proper - time ( pt ) regularization , and the dimensional regularization ( dr ) .",

    "the pauli - villars regularization is based on the subtraction of the amplitude considering the virtually heavy particle to suppress the unphysical high energy contribution coming from loop integrals @xcite .",
    "the proper - time regularization makes integrals finite through the exponentially dumping factor @xcite .",

    "we can conclude that the regularizations are safely adopted . in this context",
    "the regularization parameter independent approach is also interesting @xcite .",
    "it is expected that observation of the critical end point can distinguish a suitable regularization for an effective model of qcd by comparing with the resulting phase diagrams .",
