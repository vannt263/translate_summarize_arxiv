    "the solidification of binary alloys and the formation of so - called mushy layers are important in applications across geophysics , geology and industry , ranging from sea ice growth  @xcite , to solidification in the earth s interior  @xcite , to the formation of metal castings  @xcite .",
    "mushy layers are partially - solidified reactive porous materials comprised of solid crystals and interstitial melt , and formed as a result of morphological instability during the solidification of a two component melt  @xcite .",
    "an issue of significance in many applications is understanding the conditions for both the occurrence and the resulting dynamics of buoyancy - driven convection within the mushy region  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review . )",
    "convective flow in a mushy layer transports fluid into regions of differing concentration , which can lead to local solidification or dissolution of the solid matrix and changes in the effective material properties .",
    "the permeability of the porous matrix depends on the local solid fraction , and hence flow focussing can accelerate the growth of the underlying convective - flow instability , and eventually lead to the formation of chimneys  channels of zero solid fraction that provide efficient pathways for buoyancy - driven flow out of the mushy layer . understanding the onset and dynamics of convection in mushy layers with chimneys is of importance in geophysics for predicting brine fluxes from sea ice  @xcite , and in metallurgy because material heterogeneities associated with chimneys can lead to defects in metal castings  @xcite",
    ".    experimental studies of chimney formation in mushy layer growth typically take one of two forms .",
    "numerous so - called fixed - chill experiments have studied the transient growth of a mushy layer from a cold isothermal boundary and show that chimneys typically form after the mushy layer exceeds a critical thickness  ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as the thickness of the mushy layer continues to increase , it is observed that the mean spacing between chimneys also increases , with extinction of the flow in certain chimneys  @xcite .",
    "alternatively one also considers steady - state mushy layer growth .",
    "directional solidification experiments , where the sample material is translated between two heat exchangers , indicate that multiple chimneys form for growth rates slower than a critical threshold that depends on the initial liquid concentration  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used growth from a boundary with controlled time - dependent temperature in order to achieve steady - state growth and study the influence of an external shear flow on the onset of chimney formation . for both transient and steady state growth the critical threshold for chimney convection can be interpreted in terms of an appropriate mushy - layer rayleigh number exceeding a critical value , so that buoyancy effects overcome dissipation and lead to the onset of convective fluid flow .",
    "theoretical modelling of convective flow in mushy layers has been approached from a variety of angles .",
    "linear and weakly nonlinear stability analyses have considered the onset of convection during directional solidification under a wide variety of conditions  ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for a review and more recent summaries . ) several studies have revealed that the bifurcation to both steady and oscillatory convective flow states can be subcritical  @xcite depending on the growth conditions .",
    "hence , this raises the possibility that finite amplitude perturbations may allow states with chimney convection to be accessed even when the base state of no flow is linearly stable .",
    "convective states of finite amplitude have been considered either in direct simulations of particular growth conditions  @xcite or via studies of the system dynamics with an assumed periodic array of chimneys  @xcite . in a study of particular relevance here",
    "@xcite used a numerical approach to consider the influence of changes in the spacing between chimneys on the evolution of system dynamics and the stability of solutions with steady - state chimney convection .",
    "this approach demonstrates that the observed convective flow states are suppressed via a saddle - node bifurcation as the chimney spacing is reduced .",
    "in this study we focus on the influence of a finite sample width on the formation of chimneys during mushy layer convection . in ",
    "[ sec2 : theoretical modelling ] we describe how the theoretical model of directional solidification of @xcite can be used to study the dynamics and stability of nonlinear convective flow states of finite amplitude .",
    "an experimental procedure is described in  [ sec3:apparatus ] that produces steady - state mushy layer growth for comparison to the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "an extensive set of experiments described in   [ sec4:results ] allows us to identify conditions for chimney formation for a variety of sample widths , growth rates and liquid concentrations , with comparison to the theoretical results providing an indirect estimate of mushy layer permeability for several different liquid concentrations .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in  [ sec6:discussions ] .",
    "a theoretical model of mushy layer convection with chimneys was used by @xcite to investigate the dynamics of nonlinear convective flow , and is applied here to determine conditions under which flow states with a chimney can exist .",
    "we briefly summarise the essential features of the model below , noting that further details of the governing equations and boundary conditions are elaborated on in @xcite .",
    "the model considers the directional solidification in two dimensions of a binary solution of local temperature @xmath0 and local concentration @xmath1 , translated at a speed @xmath2 between hot and cold heat baths , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : notation ] .     and",
    "temperature @xmath3 is translated downward at speed @xmath2 between hot and cold heat exchangers , and partially solidifies to form a mushy layer of thickness @xmath4 .",
    "we adopt a local co - ordinate system @xmath5",
    "so that a eutectic solid of temperature @xmath6 and concentration @xmath7 forms at @xmath8 . we solve in a domain @xmath9 and @xmath10 as indicated by the dashed outline , with a chimney of width @xmath11 located at @xmath12 located in this domain . with suitable boundary conditions , described in the main text , this domain describes either a periodic array of convection cells separated by chimneys of width @xmath13 centred at @xmath12 and with inter - chimney spacing @xmath14 , or else a single convection cell with chimney of width @xmath11 against an impermeable free - slip vertical boundary.,height=226 ]    this results in a porous mushy region of thickness @xmath4 bounded by an impermeable eutectic solid with temperature @xmath6 and and concentration @xmath7 at @xmath8 , and an overlying fluid for @xmath15 with assumed uniform composition @xmath16 and far - field temperature @xmath3 .",
    "we simulate flow with a chimney and single convection cell of width @xmath17 , utilizing boundary conditions that simultaneously allow us to consider both convection cells that are either isolated , or in periodic arrays .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 , local solid fraction @xmath18 and darcy velocity @xmath19 within the mushy region are calculated using time - dependent ideal mushy layer theory  @xcite which conserves heat and salt , accompanied by a condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium which couples the temperature and liquid concentration via a freezing point relationship @xmath20 .",
    "we use a linear approximation @xmath21 for the freezing point relationship , where @xmath22 is constant .",
    "fluid velocities are determined from the incompressible darcy flow law , where the permeability is assumed to be @xmath23 for some reference permeability @xmath24 .",
    "we apply symmetry conditions on @xmath0 and no normal flow at @xmath25 , equivalent to either an insulating , impermeable boundary or a periodic array of convection cells .",
    "the pure liquid flow in the narrow chimney is driven by buoyancy forces or pressure gradients and is parameterised using lubrication theory  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) where we apply symmetry conditions on the velocity @xmath19 at @xmath12 .",
    "this velocity boundary condition can describe either flow within two convection cells separated by a chimney of width @xmath13 centred at @xmath12 , or else a single convection cell with chimney of width @xmath11 against an impermeable free - slip vertical boundary ( a discussion of the likely influence of using a free - slip condition rather than a no - slip condition follows at the end of   [ sec : theory ] ) . combining the lubrication approximation with similar asymptotic approximations for heat transport yields nonlinear boundary conditions on the left hand side of the mushy region , which is treated as a singular interface at @xmath12 .",
    "these conditions depend on the width of the chimney , with @xmath11 updated to satisfy a condition of marginal equilibrium to just remove any constitutional supercooling",
    ". the boundary conditions at the mush liquid interface and procedure for updating @xmath4 are described in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "a pertinent point is that this approach uses a boundary layer approximation that describes the circulation and heat transport in the overlying fluid that is induced by the mushy - layer mode of convection , but neglects any component of buoyancy - driven convection that arises due to density differences within the overlying fluid region .",
    "this model is characterized by six dimensionless parameters , @xmath26 where the fluid density is approximated by @xmath27 $ ] for constant haline coefficient @xmath28 and reference density @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath31 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath32 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath33 is the specific heat capacity , @xmath34 is the latent heat of fusion , and we have made the simplifying assumption that material properties are uniform in both solid and liquid phases in line with ideal mushy layer theory  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results presented herein investigate how the dynamics change under variations of the dimensionless sample width @xmath35 and mush rayleigh number @xmath36 which characterizes the strength of buoyancy effects compared to dissipation .",
    "the experimental concentration and temperature conditions are reflected in the concentration ratio @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , with the darcy number @xmath40 representing the relative permeability of the porous matrix .",
    "it is difficult to directly constrain and measure the permeability in experimental settings , and so in   [ sec : stabbound ] we determine a reference value of @xmath41 for a range of liquid concentrations , by comparison between experimental data and theoretical prediction .",
    "this provides an indirect estimate of the permeability for solidification in a hele - shaw cell .",
    "comparison to other estimates in different settings will be discussed in  [ sec6:discussions ] .",
    "importantly , we note that an independent set of simulations that vary @xmath40 with all other parameters held fixed show that whilst the chimney width varies with scaling @xmath42 consistent with the scaling analysis of @xcite , the fluid flux remains constant at leading order over the range @xmath43 .",
    "the same features have also been observed in a recently - developed simplified model of convection in mushy layers  ( rees - jones & worster , personal communication ) .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the flow dynamics being controlled by buoyancy - driven flow within the mushy region , whilst the chimney width adjusts passively to accommodate the necessary liquid flux .",
    "hence , the mushy - region flow dynamics do not depend strongly on the ratio of flow resistance in the porous mushy region to viscous resistance in the liquid region , consistent with only a weak dependence on @xmath40 .",
    "we maintain the value @xmath44 throughout all numerical results reported here .",
    "the fact that flow in the mushy region is relatively insensitive to viscous resistance in the liquid region also suggests that qualitatively similar results would be obtained by application of a free - slip and a no - slip boundary condition in the chimney .",
    "the boundary condition describing flow at the chimney edge takes the form @xmath45 + \\alpha_3 a\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x } , \\label{eq : chimneypsi}\\ ] ] @xcite , where the streamfunction @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 and the constant pre - factors are @xmath48 for a free - slip boundary , or @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for a no - slip boundary . for fully developed chimneys , with @xmath52",
    "the final term on the right - hand side of   is @xmath53 smaller than the remaining terms  @xcite , and so an order - one change in @xmath54 does not impact the leading order behaviour .",
    "next , we note that the numerical coefficient of the buoyancy term ( featuring @xmath55 ) has been determined using a polhausen approximation in the current calculations  @xcite .",
    "previous calculations using a different form of approximation yield a different numerical coefficient , but qualitatively similar mushy - region - flow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "hence , we expect an order - one change in @xmath55 to also produce qualitatively similar dynamics .",
    "finally , the difference in @xmath56 between free - slip and no - slip boundaries can be compensated for by a rescaling of the darcy number @xmath57 . hence , because the flow in the mushy layer is insensitive to @xmath40 at leading order , we expect no qualitative difference in the leading - order dynamics within the mushy region between cases with a free - slip or a no - slip boundary condition in the chimney .",
    "the solution procedure combines two different numerical approaches involving both time dependent calculations , and an arc - length - continuation scheme .",
    "the time dependent simulations combine second - order finite differences in space , with semi - implicit crank - nicholson timestepping , and free boundaries updated via relaxation  ( see * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "the resulting systems for temperature and streamfunction were solved using a multigrid iterative method  @xcite .",
    "this time dependent code was complemented by an arc - length - continuation method  @xcite that traces both stable and unstable solution branches , allowing us to verify that the relaxation procedures do not have a strong influence on the stability of the system .",
    "in order to reduce the computational costs in solving the systems involving jacobian terms that are required for arc - length continuation , the predictor - corrector calculations are computed from projections of the finite difference solutions onto a basis of products of chebyshev polynomials in @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this allows the main characteristics of the solution to be characterised by a smaller number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting solutions predicted by arc - length continuation in chebyshev space are then refined using a steady version of the finite - difference code .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the influence of sample width on the formation of chimneys in a mushy layer . to determine conditions for the existence of states with chimneys , the arc - length - continuation method is used to trace solution branches as @xmath35 varies with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 all held fixed , applying the method of  @xcite to a region of parameter space relevant to our experiments .",

    "the stable upper branch of chimney convection ( red circles ) and stable lower branch of no flow ( blue squares ) , are accompanied by an intermediate unstable branch of chimney convection ( black crosses ) .",
    "the system undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath67 , with the stable state of chimney convection ceasing to exist for @xmath68 .",

    "having determined the critical wavelength @xmath70 , the above procedure is repeated with varying @xmath36 but @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 held fixed to obtain a stability boundary of the form @xmath71 .",
    "examples of such stability boundaries and their comparison to experimental data are shown later in figure  [ fig4 ] and discussed in   [ sec4:results ] .",
    "note that , by construction , the theory predicts that flow with a single chimney at the centre of two symmetric convection cells requires twice the domain width as the corresponding state with a single convection cell and chimney at the sidewall .",

    "second , there is at least one vigorous compositional plume in the far - field liquid region . since intermittent chimney plumes ( or convection in a breathing mode , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are commonly observed in the experiment , we consider a chimney plume if its life time is longer than the diffusion time scale for boundary layer convection @xmath123 mins .",
    "here @xmath124 mm is the average size of an isolated plume detached from the compositional boundary layer in the liquid region and @xmath125 is the solute diffusivity .",
    "third , other turbulent buoyant plumes in the near field next to the chimney plume have become substantially diminished which indicates suppressed boundary - layer mode convection in concert with the formation of the chimney .",
    "transition from a state of no flow to a state of chimney convection is readily identified through shadowgraph pictures . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we see the flow patterns in the liquid region when two sets of parameters ( @xmath35,r@xmath126 ) are chosen .",
    "figure [ fig5]a shows that in a stable state of no flow ( these data points are indicated by upward triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) , there is no chimney flow in the far field of the liquid region in any of the cells , while small - scale turbulent plumes driven by the boundary - layer mode convection remain active",
    ". when the value of r@xmath126 increases slightly ( indicated by downward triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) , chimney flow penetrates into the far field in the two largest cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) , which are readily discernible from the small - scale turbulent plumes and dominate the flow field in the liquid region .",
    "we thus conclude that the mushy - layers growing in the two largest cells are both in an unstable configuration that leads to a state of chimney convection .     and ( a ) @xmath87=1.5k / min ; ( b ) @xmath87=1.0k / min .",

    "the horizontal white bars show 2 cm.,width=340 ]    we determine the permeability of the mushy layer @xmath24 in the following manner . by adjusting a single value of @xmath24 that is the same for three different liquid concentrations , we determine values of @xmath128 from the experimental data so that the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes is closest to the stability curve derived from numerical calculations . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the resulting comparison with the theoretical curves is consistent with the observed stability to within one increment in cell width @xmath35 .",

    "chimneys are present only at high values of r@xmath126 and large @xmath35 .",
    "fig [ fig4]b shows that as the liquid concentration increases ( to @xmath98 ) , the critical r@xmath121 decreases .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of r@xmath121 to @xmath35 increases , abruptly increasing as the confinement increases ( i.e. as @xmath35 decreases ) and preventing the onset of mushy - layer mode convection . when the liquid concentration further increases to @xmath96 , solidification of the sample with large @xmath35 becomes unstable for all the values of r@xmath126 obtained from the experiments as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]c . in summary",
    ", the system becomes less stable as the liquid concentration @xmath81 increases , which can be interpreted as follows .",
    "an increase in liquid concentration @xmath81 leads to the values of the concentration ratio @xmath37 , the stefan number @xmath39 , and the dimensionless liquid temperature @xmath38 all being reduced .",
    "changes in these parameters influence the stability of the system in different ways , as identified in the linear stability analysis of  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath37 is reduced , then the mean solid fraction is higher and hence the local permeability is reduced within the interior of the mush . in addition , a reduced value of @xmath37 leads to a thinner mushy layer and reduces the potential energy that is available to drive flow .",
    "both of these effects make the system more stable",
    ". a smaller value of @xmath39 implies that the influence of latent heat is smaller , so that the solid matrix is dissolved more easily .",
    "this promotes growth of the instability .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath38 leads to a smaller heat flux from the liquid , so that the mushy layer grows thicker and provides greater potential energy to drive flow .",
    "the present theoretical simulations of finite amplitude convection reveal that the net combination of these competing effects results in the system becoming less stable as the liquid concentration @xmath81 is increased .    .",
    "black solid squares : stable state , mushy - layer with no - chimney ; red solid triangles : one chimney forms at the walls ; green open triangles : one chimney forms off the walls ; blue open circles : formation of two chimneys within the mushy - layer ; purple open squares : formation of three or more chimneys within the mushy - layer .",
    "blue curves : numerical results for the stability curve indicating the critical r@xmath121 as a function of @xmath35 ( corresponding to a single convection cell with chimney at the wall.),width=491 ]      depending on the growth speed of the mushy - layer and the size of the sample - cell , several morphological transitions are observed in the states displaying chimney convection . to illustrate these morphological transitions we present these results as regime diagrams for three repetitions of experiments with @xmath96 in fig .",
    "the comparison between the three repetitions in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) is indicative of the role of fluctuations in influencing different experimental realisations .",
    "the stability boundary between states with and without flow is robust to within inter - experimental variation of one increment amongst the set of cell widths .",
    "the variability between observed states with and without flow under the same experimental conditions might be explained in part by the theoretically suggested sub - critical instability behaviour : the form of perturbation required to trigger a transition to a finite - amplitude convecting state might only be achieved in a subset of the experiments .",
    "the variability may also be influenced by factors not described in the theory , such as weak heat loss through the walls or boundary - layer - mode convection .",
    "the regime diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] also reveal a preference for chimney formation at the cell walls when the system undergoes a transition from a state of no flow to a state of chimney convection at @xmath134 . combining all the data in figure [ fig6 ] ,",
    "for each cooling rate we determine the states at the smallest sample width that permits convection . using this method",
    "we find four cell widths where a single chimney is observed at the cell wall , and the remaining two cell widths show either a chimney at the wall , or a chimney in the sample interior , for different repetitions under the same conditions .",
    "localization of the mushy - layer mode of convection near the walls has been observed in both experiments and models @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical calculations show that chimney formation can be influenced by lateral heat transfer due to heat losses at the sidewalls .",
    "sidewall heat transfer can have both direct thermal effects , and indirect effects by forming weak convective flows in the overlying fluid @xcite .",
    "the cooling effect of sidewall heat losses can promote the formation of chimneys near to the walls  @xcite . whilst localization of convection resulting from flow in the overlying fluid encourages chimney formation at the walls in three - dimensional mushy - layer cells , in two - dimensional flow the localisation promotes chimney formation away from the cell walls .",
    "hence , this form of flow localisation can not be the controlling factor in our quasi - two - dimensional hele - shaw cell . as an alternative factor",
    ", our theoretical model suggests that the preference for wall chimneys close to the critical cell width for onset of convection may simply be a geometrical effect due to the finite - sample - width effects in our experiment .",
    "if the stability boundary @xmath135 for states with one chimney at the wall is interpreted as the minimum width of a single convection cell , then the narrowest sample widths that can support convection necessarily have a chimney at the wall . a state with a central chimney separating two symmetric convection cells",
    "requires a minimum cell width width @xmath136 .",
    "whilst we have not conducted detailed stability calculations for asymmetric states where an interior chimney is located away from the centre of the sample , it is plausible that certain forms of these states might be stable over the range @xmath137 with the chimney separating a dominant convection cell of width greater than @xmath138 from a narrower passive region .",
    "the possibility of asymmetric arrangements of convection cells is also likely to be of relevance in describing the observed transitions to states with two or more chimneys .",
    "for the same value of r@xmath126 , transition from one - chimney states to two - chimney states occurred at a large spacing @xmath139 .",
    "although the regime boundary for this transition varies slightly between different runs , we can conclude that @xmath140 . a more detailed theoretical exploration of these morphological transitions presents an interesting opportunity for future work .",
    "in many practical contexts it is desirable to predict growth conditions which avoid the formation of chimneys in growing mushy layers . in cells that are sufficiently wide to permit the formation of multiple chimneys ,",
    "experimental and theoretical models have been applied to infer a critical value r@xmath121 beyond which the mushy - layer mode convection will occur  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the cell width @xmath35 provides an additional constraint on the existence of convective instability . in particular , @xcite studied the evolution of finite amplitude states of convection with chimneys and showed that as @xmath35 is decreased the chimneys are extinguished via a saddle - node bifurcation at some critical @xmath141 .",
    "the present work provides the first experimental observation of this finite - sample - size effect on buoyancy - driven convection in the solidification of mushy layers .",
    "we observe a discernible transition of the flow field in the liquid region overlying the mushy layer as mush - rayleigh number r@xmath126 and cell width are varied . the flow instability is systematically quantified by the sample spacing @xmath35 and r@xmath126 for a variety of liquid concentrations . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we showed two sets of data from experiments conducted at two different cooling rates . at a high cooling rate ,",
    "the resulting value of r@xmath126 and the chimney spacing @xmath35 ( indicated by the upward triangles in figure [ fig4]b ) characterize a stable , no - chimney state ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) . a small reduction of the cooling rate increases the value of r@xmath126 ( shown by the downward triangles in figure [ fig4]b ) , and causes a flow instability in the mushy layer that results in a new state dominated by the formation of vigorous chimney plumes in the liquid region ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) . using the same nominal experimental control parameters ,",
    "the critical rayleigh number in different runs varies less than @xmath142 , as is also evident from the data shown in fig .",
    "thus , these experimental studies provide reliable results and a general framework for direct comparisons with the prior numerical and theoretical studies , revealing that the system becomes less stable to the onset of flow if either the cell width , rayleigh number or liquid concentration are increased .    in determining the unknown reference permeability @xmath24 of the mushy layer , we compared experimental and numerical results for the instability of the mushy - layer mode of convection summarized in fig .",
    "good comparison can be achieved using a single value of the permeability @xmath129 @xmath130 across the entire experimental range of @xmath81 .",
    "this suggests that the reference permeability is relatively insensitive to changes in the liquid concentration .",
    "it is interesting to compare our estimate of the reference permeability in our quasi - two dimensional experiment to previous estimates .",
    "for example , for solidification in a fully three - dimensional experimental cell @xcite estimated a mean permeability value of @xmath143 based on the carmen - kozeny relation and solid fractions inferred from measured temperature and salinity , whilst @xcite estimated a reference permeability @xmath144 by comparing to a linear stability threshold for the onset of shear enhanced convection .",
    "finally , @xcite estimated a significantly lower value of the mean permeability @xmath145 based on the carmen - kozeny relation and solid fractions measured via computed tomography",
    ". however , this corresponds to a permeability both after the onset of convection and measured two days after the end of the experiment , allowing the system to evolve away from the initial value of permeability before convective onset .",
    "hence , the difference in magnitude of the inferred reference permeability between our experiments and those of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the permeability is significantly lower for solidification in a quasi two - dimensional cell than for a three - dimensional cell .    through this dynamical constraint of the permeability , the theoretical model for finite - amplitude convecting states",
    "successfully captures the form of the observed stability boundary to within the inter - experimental variability of one increment in sample width .",
    "this suggests that the theoretical framework of  @xcite may provide a useful tool in future studies to investigate how chimney formation is influenced by additional factors , such as coupling to flow in the overlying liquid , in a fully nonlinear setting ."
