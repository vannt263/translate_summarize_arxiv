    "the d0 collaboration has measured the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath4-hadron decays @xmath5 .",
    "the following result has been reported @xcite:@xmath6 the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry @xmath7 for semileptonic decay of @xmath4 hadrons is defined as@xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the number of events containing two @xmath4-hadrons that decay semileptonically two positive or negative muons with the quark subprocesses : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this result indicates a 3.2 @xmath2 deviation from the standard model ( sm ) prediction .",
    "a confirmation of this deviation would provide unambiguous evidence for new physics ( np ) at low energy with a new source of cp violating phases .",
    "it is a common feature for any physics beyond the sm to possess additional sources of cp violation besides the sm phase in quark mixing matrix .",
    "these new phases can induce sizable contributions to direct and indirect cp asymmetries in @xmath13 decays and thereby resolve the apparent discrepancies between the observed results and the sm expectations .",
    "the charge asymmetry @xmath5 at the tevatron can be expressed as @xmath14 @xcite , where the charge asymmetry @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) for  wrong - charge \" semileptonic @xmath17-meson decay induced by the oscillation is defined by @xmath18 this asymmetry can be written as @xcite @xmath19 where the mass and width differences between @xmath20 mass eigenstates are given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the dispersive and the absorptive parts of the mixing amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the cp violating phase @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 . in the sm , the arguments of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are aligned at the leading order due to the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix , and thus , the phase @xmath26 is small irrespective of the individual phases , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath29 is roughly proportional to @xmath30 with a small phase , and as a result , the sm prediction of the charge asymmetry is small : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , which is in clear contradiction with the d0 result in eq.([d0result ] ) . in this respect , it is clear that a large new cp violation in @xmath0 mixing is required to enhance @xmath34 if @xmath35 mixing does not contain a new physics contribution .",
    "the phase @xmath36 can be large in general in many new physics models because the phase alignment between @xmath37 and @xmath1 can be broken if a new particle , such as a supersymmetric particle , propagates in the loop diagram , which contributes to the mixing amplitude @xcite .",
    "however , the absorptive part @xmath1 is not necessarily modified by the propagation of new particles due to the on - shell condition of the intermediate states .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath37 is determined by the mass difference @xmath38 , and thus eq.([a_sl^q ] ) tells us that @xmath34 has a maximal value if @xmath1 is dominated by the sm tree level contribution @xcite .",
    "one can easily show that if one simply extrapolates eq.([a_sl^q ] ) , then one needs a new phase @xmath36 with @xmath39 ( which is outside of the domain of @xmath40 ) in order to account for the experimental result of @xmath5 @xcite by the d0 collaboration . also with a large @xmath41 ,",
    "the decay width difference @xmath42 is suppressed and becomes inconsistent with the experimental constraints .",
    "therefore , one concludes that the sustainability of the d0 results of the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath4-hadrons decay would be a clear hint of possible np that modify the absorptive part of the mixing amplitude @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we show that the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) induced by the higgs coupling in two higgs doublet models ( thdm ) can provide a solution to the dimuon charge asymmetry puzzle by enhancing @xmath1 .",
    "the thdm is classified by the selection of the higgs couplings to fermions .",
    "we will consider a general type of coupling ( so called type iii thdm ) to obtain an appropriate fcnc source to modify @xmath1 .",
    "we enumerate the experimental constraints and investigate if there is room to enhance @xmath1 to achieve the d0 result of the dimuon asymmetry .",
    "we will obtain the operators generated by charged higgs exchange which can enhance @xmath43 . to accomplish this , suitably large higgs couplings to the first and second quark generations needed .",
    "such couplings can , in addition , lead to an excess of higgs decays into dijets .",
    "indeed , the cdf collaboration has recently reported a @xmath44 excess in the 120 - 160 gev range in the invariant mass distribution of the dijets in association with a @xmath45 boson @xcite .",
    "the excess may be explained by the higgs decays to dijets via the new higgs couplings .",
    "the presence of two higgs doublets is required in supersymmetric models and in models with the left - right gauge symmetry @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we briefly explore if the left - right symmetric model can explain the large dimuon asymmetry consistent with other experimental constraints .",
    "the two higgs doublet model is an extension of the sm that naturally introduces a new source of cp violation and fcnc @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "the most general renormalizable and gauge invariant yukawa interactions are given by@xmath47 where the higgs fields @xmath48 have hypercharges @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are defined as @xmath51 .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) are @xmath55 matrices with a generic flavor structure . in this case , the fermion masses are given as @xmath56 in the basis where the mass matrix is diagonal , fcnc interactions through the neutral higgs ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) exchange are generated from the mismatch between the diagonalization of the mass matrices and the yukawa interactions .",
    "for instance , couplings like @xmath59 and @xmath60 are induced by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the diagonalizing matrices of @xmath64 .",
    "hereafter , we will work in the basis where @xmath64 is diagonal , and we omit @xmath65 in the expressions .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "these couplings contribute to @xmath0-@xmath68 mixing and modify the amplitude @xmath37 as follows @xcite:@xmath69 where @xmath70 is given by@xmath71 we note that even in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) this type of modification of @xmath37 via the neutral higgs exchange can be obtained for large @xmath72 through the finite correction of the yukawa couplings due to soft susy breaking terms . in this case , if @xmath73 , the charge asymmetry @xmath74 is given by@xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath78 can be large if @xmath79 and @xmath80 are large , satisfying the experimental constraint : @xmath81 .",
    "as mentioned above , a large value of @xmath82 is necessary but not sufficient to account for the dimuon cp asymmetry @xmath5 . a significant enhancement of @xmath1 is preferable .    in the 2hdm several @xmath83 effective operators which may modify @xmath1 ,",
    "can be generated .",
    "for example , with non - vanishing @xmath84 and @xmath85 the operator @xmath86 is generated through the charged higgs exchange .",
    "let us enumerate the possible @xmath87 effective operators generated via the higgs exchange , which are suitable for modifying @xmath1 .    1 .",
    "@xmath88 2 .",
    "@xmath89 3 .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 4 .",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93    the operator @xmath94 is generated through the charged higgs exchange with the coefficient : @xmath95_{qi } \\left[\\frac{m_u^{\\rm diag } \\cos\\beta}{v } - y_u^\\prime \\right]_{q^\\prime j}^*. \\label{bscc - operator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we will see below , this is the preferred operator for modifying @xmath1 .",

    "! y_d^\\prime \\right]_{q^\\prime 2}^*\\!.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this operator can modify @xmath1 through interference with @xmath45 boson exchange . the effect can be large if @xmath98 and @xmath99 are sizable . however , one needs fine - tuning to obtain a large contribution to @xmath1 since the strange mass is @xmath100 .",
    "such fine tuning may also generate the operator @xmath101 , which affects @xmath102 by an amount which causes disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "the operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be generated through the neutral higgs exchange .",
    "we note that both operators are needed to modify @xmath1 since @xmath103 can not be self - conjugate .",
    "finally , the operators @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be generated from @xmath106 , @xmath107 via the neutral higgs exchange .",
    "it is remarkable that when @xmath108 generates the muon mass , br(@xmath109 ) is not constrained by experiment and @xmath43 can be modified .",
    "note that in mssm ( or thdm with @xmath110 ) , the following relation is obtained @xmath111 thus , due to the experimental bound on br(@xmath112 ) , the quantity br(@xmath113 ) can not be large enough to modify @xmath1 .    in the case of neutral higgs exchanges ,",
    "@xmath43 is modified at one - loop level while @xmath114 operator to modify @xmath37 is also generated through the neutral higgs exchanges at tree level .",
    "therefore , to obtain a sizable @xmath1 contribution , a large @xmath37 is also generated , which is unwanted .",
    "next we consider the following experimental constraints :    1 .",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 decays .",
    "2 .   @xmath117 .",
    "3 .   lifetime ratio @xmath118 .",
    "the constraints from two body decays into mesons and leptons are studied in @xcite , and the allowed operators for @xmath83 are @xmath119 in the mssm , it is difficult to enhance the @xmath87 operators selectively because the interactions are related by known ( or constrained ) coupling constants .",
    "the non - holomorphic yukawa coupling @xmath120 can also contribute to the charged higgs interaction and lead to an important effect on @xmath117 . in a non - susy type ii 2hdm",
    ", the charged higgs has to be heavier than @xmath121 gev to agree with the experimental measurement of @xmath117 .",
    "however , in our case , this constraint can be relaxed by a small @xmath120 contribution .",
    "note that @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) is constrained by @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) contribution .",
    "the @xmath117 process also constrains the large log contribution due to the renormalization group evolution below the @xmath45 boson mass @xcite .",
    "the @xmath117 constraint disfavors the neutral higgs contributions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the operators @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xmath128 give leading order large log corrections ( @xmath129 ) to the @xmath117 operators , and hence they are dangerous operators .",
    "we note that the charged higgs contribution can generate only next to leading order corrections .",
    "finally , the lifetime ratio @xmath118 provides a stringent constraint on the operator contributing to @xmath1 .",
    "the modification of @xmath1 can induce a change ( @xmath130% ) in the lifetime of @xmath0 , which can be consistent with the large hadronic uncertainty . however , this uncertainty is cancelled in the lifetime ratio @xmath118 .",
    "the current world average of the experimental result is @xcite @xmath131 therefore , if @xmath1 is modified , the lifetime of @xmath35 should also modified , which provides a strong constraint .",
    "actually , for @xmath35 system , it is known that the bound for br(@xmath132 .",
    "consequently , the modification of @xmath1 via @xmath109 has a deficit due to this lifetime ratio constraint . the only allowed operator to modify the @xmath35 lifetime seems to be @xmath133 , which can modify @xmath134 .",
    "fortunately , the operator @xmath133 alone modifies neither @xmath135 nor @xmath136 since @xmath137 is not self - conjugate .",
    "the above constraints imply that the only possibility left is the charged higgs exchange operator @xmath138 @xmath139 .",
    "the coefficients of these operators are obtained , as in eq.([bscc - operator ] ) , and they are proportional to @xmath140 , where @xmath141_{ij}$ ] . in order to generate the operators @xmath142 and @xmath133 , we need @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the condition @xmath145 can make these effective operators comparable to keep the lifetime ratio @xmath118",
    ". the condition can be satisfied when @xmath146 .",
    "however , if @xmath147 is sizable , one needs fine tuning to obtain the proper up quark mass",
    ". this can be relaxed if @xmath72 is large .",
    "the @xmath1 contribution is estimated as @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "the contribution to the dispersive part of the mixing can be written as @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the inami - lim functions .",
    "if we choose @xmath154 appropriately , the charged higgs contribution to @xmath37 can vanish , keeping the contribution to @xmath1 , ( in fact , if @xmath155 and @xmath156 , a gim - like mechanism works for the dispersive part of the meson mixing amplitudes ) .",
    "this is because the top - loop can contribute to @xmath37 , but not to @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , one can avoid an excessive contribution to @xmath37 and still modify @xmath1 appropriately in this scenario .     versus @xmath157 , width=377 ]    in fig.[fig1 ] , we show @xmath158 as a function of @xmath157 , where we assume @xmath159 for simplicity .",
    "we choose the charged higgs mass to be 160 gev .    in order to modify @xmath1",
    ", we need @xmath160 whose magnitude depends on the charged higgs mass @xmath161 .",
    "as previously mentioned , we need to fine - tune in order to obtain the proper up quark mass in order to satisfy the lifetime ratio .",
    "the fine - tuning can be relaxed when the charged higgs is light .",
    "however , the constraints from @xmath162 and @xmath163 should be taken into account @xcite . in a general 2hdm",
    ", the non - holomorphic coupling @xmath164 can contribute to the @xmath165 mass , and thus the @xmath166 coupling ( which is important to @xmath167 ) may have freedom to relax the @xmath168 constraint .",
    "the sizable higgs coupling @xmath169 can provide an interesting hadron collider signal .",
    "the coupling can cause a resonant production of the charged and neutral higgs bosons ( which mainly contain @xmath170 ) .",
    "the higgs bosons decay into two jets via the @xmath147 and @xmath85 couplings , which are needed to enlarge @xmath1 .",
    "thus , dijet excesses can be observed around the masses of the higgs bosons .",
    "if the higgs boson is light ( @xmath171 200 gev ) , the dijet events are buried under the qcd background . however , even if the higgs boson is light , there is a chance to observe dijet events produced by higgs decays associated with @xmath45/@xmath172 gauge bosons .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration has reported an excess of dijets associated with @xmath45 boson ( which decay into @xmath173 ) @xcite .",
    "the excess in the dijet mass distribution is in the 120 - 160 gev range , and it can be explained if the higgs boson mass is about 150 - 160 gev ( the peak of the dijet mass distribution shifts to lower mass due to cuts ) .",
    "we note that the bottom quark mass should be generated by @xmath174 because @xmath4-quark excess is not observed .",

    ", width=377 ]    the charged and neutral higgs bosons associated with the @xmath45 boson are produced by the @xmath176-channel exchange of the left - handed quarks through the @xmath160 coupling . the resonant ( or off - shell ) production of the charged / neutral higgs boson through @xmath160 can also contribute to the neutral / charged higgs boson associated with the @xmath45 boson .",
    "similar processes via a higgs doublet are also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the cdf estimated production rate of @xmath3 excess is about 4 pb . we use madgraph / madevent ( version 5 ) to estimate the @xmath177 cross - sections in this model . in fig.[fig3 ] , we plot @xmath178 as a function of @xmath179 for @xmath180 gev ( neutral higgs masses are also 160 gev ) . in the figure we use a @xmath181 factor @xmath182 .",
    "the @xmath183 production cross - section is dominated by charged higgs associated production ( roughly 70% ) .",
    "the charged higgs boson then decays 100% into jets .",
    "we find that the excess can be explained for higgs couplings @xmath184 .",
    "we also have @xmath185 ( includes both charged and neutral higgs ) productions in this model , but the cross - section is at least a factor 3 smaller compared to the @xmath183 production .",
    "the @xmath186 production cross - section goes further down if the neutral higgs masses are heavier than the charged higgs masses .    in fig.[fig2 ] , we plot @xmath158 as a function of @xmath122 , where we choose @xmath175 and @xmath180 gev . since in this case",
    "we need @xmath122 to be @xmath187 to produce the desired @xmath1 modification .",
    "due to this small @xmath122 , we have a very small amount of single @xmath4 quark present in the @xmath188 signal .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath122 is constrained by @xmath124 operator . in order to turn on the @xmath122 term",
    ", one should make @xmath189 small and the bottom quark mass should come from the non - holomorphic term .",
    "the absorptive part of the mixing is insensitive to @xmath154 , and thus @xmath154 can be used to adjust the dispersive part of the mixings .",
    "in susy models , the non - holomorphic terms ( @xmath190 couplings ) can arise only from the finite corrections .",
    "a sizable contribution to @xmath37 is easily obtained , but in order to obtain sizable effects for @xmath1 consistence with other experimental constraints such as @xmath117 , @xmath191 tev scale physics should be considered @xcite .    in the left - right symmetric gauge theory ( lr model ) , the gauge symmetry is extended to @xmath46 @xcite . in this model , a number of higgs fields and couplings are usually needed in order to obtain the required quark masses and ckm mixings .",
    "the higgs couplings can generate fcnc , which can affect the dimuon asymmetry , as described in the previous section .",
    "in addition , the @xmath192 gauge bosons can also contribute to @xmath1 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "let us estimate the contributions of these gauge bosons to the mixing amplitudes .",
    "the rrrr operator @xmath193 can contribute to @xmath194 ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the left- and right - handed quark mixing matrices , @xmath198 are the gauge coupling constants , and @xmath199 are the masses of the @xmath200 gauge bosons ( in general , these bosons can mix ) .",
    "we have used here the unitarity of the quark mixing matrices : @xmath201 . note that the @xmath202 contribution from the rrrr operator is tiny because of the unitarity of @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",

    "note that the contribution to @xmath194 via the llrr operator can be negligible because charm or up quark masses are inserted ( or @xmath210-@xmath211 mixing is inserted twice ) .    as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath212 the correction to @xmath194 should be less than about 30% when @xmath213 and @xmath214 . therefore , the contribution via the right - handed gauge boson is not a better choice to modify @xmath1 since modification to @xmath37 will be too large irrespective of the choice of the right - handed quark mixing matrix .    the merit of the right - handed gauge boson is to modify @xmath134 to adjust the lifetime ratio for @xmath35 and @xmath0 . if the right - handed quark mixing matrix is @xmath215 the operator @xmath216 is generated by @xmath211 exchange , and the lifetime of @xmath35 can be tuned depending on @xmath217 . in the previous section , we found that the element @xmath169 can modify @xmath134 but it requires fine - tuning to obtain the proper up quark mass .",
