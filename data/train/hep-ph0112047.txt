    "<S> we discuss the puzzling experimental results on baryon - antibaryon production in @xmath0 annihilation close to the threshold , in particular the fact that @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss an interpretation in terms of a two - step process , via an intermediate coherent isovector state serving as an intermediary between @xmath0 and the baryon - antibaryon system . </S>",
    "<S> we provide evidence that the isovector channel dominates both @xmath2 and from @xmath3 annihilation at rest , and show that the observed ratio of @xmath4 can be understood quantitatively in this picture .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental data from the fenice collaboration @xcite indicate that @xmath5 is relatively large close to threshold . </S>",
    "<S> their data may be compared with earlier data on @xmath6 @xcite and also with data on the time - reversed reaction @xmath7 , for which more precise data are available @xcite .    as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nnbar ] , the combined data indicate that @xmath8 when @xmath9 gev . </S>",
    "<S> averaging over the available data on both the direct and time - reversed reactions , which are very consistent , and ignoring any possible variation with energy , we find : @xmath10 in other words , _ close to the @xmath11 threshold , the timelike form factor of the proton is somewhat smaller than that of the neutron ! _    the fact that this ratio is less than unity requires confirmation , but even equal cross sections for @xmath12 and @xmath13 would be quite surprising , in view of the the conventional perturbative picture of baryon - antibaryon production in @xmath0 annihilation , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ee - fig ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the ratio of the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath14-channel processes @xmath15 should be infinite at zero momentum transfer , where the form factor simply measures the total proton and neutron charges , corresponding to a coherent sum over the electromagnetic charges of their constituent quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it is also believed that the ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) should be large at high momentum transfers . in a naive perturbative description of @xmath0 annihilation into baryons , the virtual time - like </S>",
    "<S> photon first makes a ` primary ' @xmath16 pair , which is then dressed by two additional quark - antiquark pairs that pop out of the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> this dressing is thought to be a perturbative qcd process at high momentum transfers , which does not distinguish between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , since gluon couplings are flavor - blind . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this conventional perturbative picture , the only difference between the production rates of proton and neutron is through the different electric charges of the primary @xmath16 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the total perturbative cross section is obtained by superposing the amplitudes with different primary @xmath16 pairs and squaring the result : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the amplitude at @xmath21 for making the baryon @xmath22 with a given primary flavor @xmath23 , which is determined by the baryon wave functions .    </S>",
    "<S> since the wave functions of the baryon octet have a mixed symmetry , the amplitudes @xmath20 tend to be highly asymmetric in specific models . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the chernyak - zhitnitsky proton wave function  @xcite , the @xmath17 quark dominates , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and similarly @xmath26 , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a limiting case we have @xmath28 while this is an extreme case , on general grounds we expect that the @xmath17 contribution dominates in the proton and the @xmath18 in the neutron , so that @xmath29 at large momentum transfers .    </S>",
    "<S> we find it puzzling that the experimental ratio ( [ exptalratio ] ) is apparently below unity when @xmath30  gev@xmath31 , whereas the ratio should be much larger than unity at both larger ( timelike ) and smaller ( spacelike ) momentum transfers . clearly , the mechanism at work here is qualitatively different from those responsible for the above intuition .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a conventional theoretical explanation is part of the motivation for the proposed new asymmetrical @xmath32 high - statistics collider at slac for the regime @xmath33 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this machine will yield high - precision data on baryon production in @xmath32 annihilation at threshold , providing a check on the fenice data and an accurate benchmark for testing possible theoretical explanations .    </S>",
    "<S> the first thing one must realize is that even though @xmath34 , the process is highly nonperturbative . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the ` extra ' kinetic energy available to the quarks is very small .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach @xcite to this puzzle is based on thinking about the time - reversed processes : @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> these may be viewed as two - step processes , with a coherent meson state serving as an intermediate state , as shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pions1-fig ] .    </S>",
    "<S> one possible motivation for this picture might be provided by the skyrme model  @xcite , according to which baryons appear as solitons in a purely bosonic chiral lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> this model is formally justified as a low - energy approximation to large-@xmath36 qcd  @xcite , and is known to provide a good description of many low - energy properties of baryons : see  @xcite for reviews . </S>",
    "<S> skyrmion - anti - skyrmion annihilation provides  @xcite-@xcite a fairly accurate description of low - energy baryon - antibaryon annihilation . just after the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion touch </S>",
    "<S> , they ` unravel ' each other , and a coherent classical pion wave emerges as a burst that takes away energy and baryon number as quickly as causality permits . </S>",
    "<S> a specific parametrization of the initial pion configuration is  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the profile of the chiral field , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 is a range parameter , @xmath41 is chosen so that the total energy is that of the @xmath11 pair , and the form of @xmath38 guarantees that the pion configuration has zero net baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> this crude model has been shown  @xcite to reproduce satisfactorily the inclusive single - pion spectrum in @xmath42 annihilation at rest and the branching ratios for multi - pion final states .    </S>",
    "<S> the details of this specific configuration are unimportant for our purposes : what is important is that the data are not inconsistent with such a model . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , although the skyrme model provides some motivation for our approach , it is not even essential for our purpose . </S>",
    "<S> what is important is that _ a single intermediate state should dominate _ the two - step @xmath35 process . </S>",
    "<S> this could , for example , equally well be a single intermediate @xmath43 resonant meson state .    to be more precise , </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath11 annihilation is a strong - interaction process , one must consider separately the @xmath44 and @xmath45 channels . </S>",
    "<S> accurately stated , our key assumption is that both of these channels are dominated by single states . </S>",
    "<S> these might be some excited @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons , for example , just as well as coherent pion configurations ( [ amado ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    with this picture in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we write the @xmath48 @xmath35 annihilation amplitudes as @xmath49 , where the overall phase is irrelevant , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are relatively real , and @xmath52 is the relative phase between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we then have @xmath53 it is apparent from ( [ ratio ] ) that @xmath54 if either @xmath55 or _ </S>",
    "<S> vice versa_.    remarkably , _ there is evidence from both @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilations that @xmath57 final states dominate by large factors_.    the clearest evidence comes from @xmath58 , where it is found by measuring final states with even and odd numbers of pions respectively that @xmath59 as seen in fig .

    "<S> fig : pions ] .. the cross section in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pions ] corresponds to the final state @xmath60 ; for the total @xmath61 one should multiply it by 1.5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] at these energies , we expect most final states created by @xmath62 to contain @xmath63 pairs , so that ( [ eeratio ] ) corresponds to the non-@xmath64 initial states we expect to dominate in @xmath11 annihilation </S>",
    "<S> . the value ( [ eeratio ] ) is similar to that found at lower energies , where @xmath65 , in agreement with naive quark models . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the ratio @xmath66 continues to be large at higher energies is consistent with ideas of generalized vector meson dominance . </S>",
    "<S> the data from @xmath67 annihilations are less clear . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , there are various calculations and other suggestions that the cross sections for @xmath67 annihilations into @xmath44 and @xmath45 may be similar . experimentally , several initial states contribute , including @xmath68s@xmath69 , @xmath70s / d@xmath71 and various p waves , but we are interested only in the @xmath43 @xmath70s / d@xmath71 initial states . </S>",
    "<S> it is in principle possible to distinguish different initial states by comparing annihilations in gas and liquid , as has been done in the analysis of ozi - violating final states , but we are unaware of a comparable analysis of multi - pion final states . because the initial state is a mixture with different @xmath72 , it is not possible to separate @xmath44 from @xmath45 simply by counting pions , as was the case in @xmath56 annihilation .    </S>",
    "<S> the most convincing experimental information known to us comes from an analysis of @xmath73 . by comparing the rates for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , it has been possible to extract  @xcite @xmath76 which is comparable to the corresponding ratio ( [ eeratio ] ) in @xmath77 annihilation </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 in the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) is consistent with the hypothesis that most of the @xmath78 final states are created by @xmath79 and @xmath80 pairs in the initial @xmath67 state , with a @xmath64 pair popping out of the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio ( [ nnbarratio ] ) would be small if primary @xmath64 pairs dominated .    </S>",
    "<S> we now use the experimental information on the dominance by the @xmath44 channel in both @xmath56 ( [ eeratio ] ) and @xmath70s / d@xmath71 annihilation ( [ nnbarratio ] ) in a quantitative analysis of the @xmath81 production @xmath82 ratio ( [ ratio ] ) . defining @xmath83 , </S>",
    "<S> we can rewrite ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath84 it is clear that the zero - momentum - transfer limit @xmath85 is obtained in the limit @xmath86 , and that the high - momentum - transfer limit @xmath87 is obtained in the limit @xmath88 . in order to estimate @xmath89 , our assumption of dominance in each isospin channel by a single state ( either a coherent multi - pion state ( [ amado ] ) or a generalized vector meson @xmath90 ) tells us that @xmath91 inserting the experimental indications ( [ eeratio],[nnbarratio ] ) into ( [ factorization ] ) , we estimate that @xmath92 the top end of this range seems to us quite conservative , whereas the lower end surely requires more justification from @xmath11 annihilation data . in the following numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we keep @xmath93 general , but focus extra attention on the limits @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent from ( [ newratio ] ) that @xmath96 is possible for any value of @xmath93 , for a restricted range of the relative phase @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the allowed range of @xmath52 is extended if @xmath93 is small . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that @xmath82 lies in a narrow range @xmath98 around unity if @xmath52 falls within the following range : @xmath99 it is apparent that @xmath96 for all values of @xmath52 if @xmath93 is small , as suggested ( [ epsilon ] ) by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative behaviour of @xmath82 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : threed ] . displayed explicitly is the region of the @xmath102 plane where @xmath82 falls within the experimental range ( [ exptalratio ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that this range favours @xmath103 , whatever the value of @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : twod ] displays projections of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : threed ] for the two limiting values @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the allowed range ( [ exptalratio ] ) of @xmath82 and the corresponding ranges of @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> are also shown .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the _ a priori _ puzzling large experimental value of the ratio @xmath104 can be understood qualitatively . </S>",
    "<S> this is relatively easy if the @xmath105 amplitude dominates over the @xmath45 amplitude , as suggested by the available data on @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation and our assumption of dominance by a single coherent state in each isospin channel . </S>",
    "<S> the specific range ( [ exptalratio ] ) can be understood quantitatively if the @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitude have a large relative phase @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we are not in a position to judge the plausibility of such a large value of @xmath52 , from either an experimental or a theoretical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to make tests of this possibility .    </S>",
    "<S> the disagreement between the naive theoretical prediction and experiment is striking again .    </S>",
    "<S> we comment finally on the surprisingly large value of the ratio @xmath106 observed by the cleo collaboration @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite for related experimental work ) .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cleo - gg - fig ] , cleo find that close to threshold , which seems analogous to fenice result for the @xmath107 ratio .    as illustrated by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gg - fig ] , for a given quark flavor , the perturbative amplitude for baryon - antibaryon production in the photon - photon reaction scales like the quark charge squared , compared with the linear dependence of the amplitudes on the quark charge in the @xmath0 case discussed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> thus one might naively expect the ratio @xmath108 to be even smaller than the corresponding perturbative prediction for @xmath109 in @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> .    it would be interesting to approach this puzzle from a point of view similar to that adopted in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , the situation in @xmath110 collisions is more complicated , because of the wider range of possible spin and isospin states . also , the information available on the isospin and spin decomposition is sparse compared with that in @xmath0 annihilation , which we used above . </S>",
    "<S> data for @xmath111 close to threshold might cast light on the @xmath112 puzzle , but are not yet available .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have proposed a simple model that is able to accommodate the surprisingly large observed value of the ratio @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> our suggestion is based on a simple two - step approach , in which a single intermediate state with @xmath44 dominates over @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this dominant intermediate state could be motivated by a skyrmion - anti - skyrmion picture , or could be some excited @xmath46 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> our model could be tested by further measurements of the ratios of different isospin amplitudes in @xmath56 and @xmath11 annihilation , and suggests a relatively large phase difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to more experimental data bearing on these issues , for example from a new low - energy @xmath56 collider  @xcite . </S>"
