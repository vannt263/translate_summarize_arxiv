    "the wireless ad hoc network ( wanet ) represents a class of self - organizing network architecture , which consists of nodes communicating with each other over peer - to - peer wireless channels without centralized infrastructure @xcite .",
    "since wanets can be flexibly deployed and reconfigured at very low cost , they are highly promising for a lot of critical applications , such as disaster relief , emergency rescue , daily information exchange , traffic off - loading and coverage extension for 5 g cellular networks @xcite . to facilitate the application and commercialization of wanets , protecting",
    "their transmission security is of great significance @xcite .",

    "an information - theoretic approach which exploits the fundamental characteristics of wireless channel to achieve perfect secrecy , has been extensively studied over the past few decades .",
    "based on the results of shannon in @xcite , wyner first indicated that perfect secrecy is achievable when the conditions of main channel between transmitter and receiver are better than that of wiretap channel between transmitter and eavesdropper @xcite . following this line",
    ", many research activities have been devoted to the study of physical layer security under various channel models , such as the broadcast channel @xcite , gaussian wiretap channel @xcite , two - way wiretap channel @xcite , multi - access channel @xcite and mimo wiretap channel @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , lots of approaches for improving physical layer security have been proposed in literature .",
    "the works of @xcite demonstrated that the strategies of cooperative jamming and relay selection can be utilized to enhance physical layer security .",
    "the works of @xcite indicated that physical layer security can also be facilitated by applying coding schemes .",
    "moreover , the combinations of physical layer security with other techniques such as power allocation , signal processing , and cross - layer optimization were explored in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "since physical layer security has the advantage of low computational complexity and can be easily implemented in a distributed manner , its application in wanets has attracted considerable academic attention recently @xcite . for a large - scale wanet , vasudevan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the asymptotic behaviors of security - capacity tradeoff as the number of network nodes tends to infinity .",
    "the price in terms of performance degradation for ensuring physical layer security in wanets was explored under the asymptotically large network scenario @xcite and single - hop network scenario @xcite , respectively .",

    "although there have been extensive works for studying physical layer security in wireless networks , they mainly focus on either the single - hop and two - hop network scenarios , or the asymptotically large network scenarios , while the research of physical layer security in multi - hop wanets which fills the significant gap between those two extremes is largely untouched and thus remains a technical challenge . by now , some initial results have been reported on the study of physical layer security in multi - hop wanets @xcite .",

    "it is notable that , however , security usually comes with a cost in terms of performance degradation @xcite , thus the tradeoffs between security and other network performance should be carefully addressed for a practical multi - hop wanet . as a step towards this end , this paper , for the first time , explores the physical layer security - aware routing and corresponding performance tradeoffs between transmission security and communication quality of service ( qos ) in a multi - hop wanet .",
