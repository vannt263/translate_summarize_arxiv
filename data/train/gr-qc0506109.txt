    "this paper presents some partial results for a wide parameter space search for periodic gravitational waves using data from the ligo detectors .",
    "the most promising sources for such waves are isolated pulsars .",
    "previous searches for gravitational waves from pulsars have been of two kinds .",
    "the first is a search targeting pulsars whose parameters are known through radio observations .",
    "these searches typically use matched filtering techniques and are not very computationally expensive .",
    "an example of such a search is @xcite which targets psr j1939 + 2134 using data from the first science runs of the ligo and geo detectors .",
    "the end result is an upper limit on the strength of the gravitational wave emitted by this pulsar and therefore on its ellipticity .",
    "see also @xcite which applies some of the techniques presented in @xcite to a large number of known pulsars using data from the second science run of the ligo detectors .",
    "the second kind of searches look for pulsars which have not yet been observed by radio telescopes .",
    "this involves searching over large parameter space volumes and turns out to be computationally limited .",
    "this is because looking for weak continuous wave signals requires large observation times to build up signal to noise ratio and to claim a detection with some degree of confidence ; on the other hand , the number of templates that must be searched over , and therefore the computational requirements , increase rapidly with the observation time .",
    "an example of such a search is @xcite where a 2-day long data stretch from the explorer bar detector is used to perform an all sky search in a narrow frequency band around the resonant frequency of the detector .",
    "all the searches mentioned above rely on a coherent integration over the full observation time ; it is well known that this is the optimal method .",
    "however , a full coherent integration is computationally expensive and it is therefore also useful to consider methods which are less sensitive but computationally inexpensive .",
    "such methods typically involve semi - coherent combinations of the signal power in short stretches of data .",
    "the hough transform is an example of such a method @xcite . using this method",
    ", we perform an _ all - sky _ search over a large frequency range using two months of data from the ligo detectors . as in all the searches",
    "mentioned above , we assume that the pulsar does not glitch during the full observation time considered .    section [ sec : waveform ] briefly describes the waveforms that we are looking for .",
    "section [ sec : houghbasics ] describes our search method , the hough transform .",
    "the search pipeline and the parameter space we search over is given in section [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "the search results are given in section [ sec : searchresults ] .",
    "section [ sec : hardwareinj ] presents a validation of our search method using hardware injected signals and finally section [ sec : conc ] concludes with a summary of our results and plans for further work .",
    "the form of the gravitational wave emitted by an isolated pulsar , as seen by a gravitational wave detector is @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is time in the detector frame , @xmath2 is the polarization angle of the wave , @xmath3 are the detector antenna pattern functions for the two polarizations . if we assume the emission mechanism is due to deviations of the pulsar s shape from perfect axial symmetry , then the gravitational waves are emitted at a frequency which is twice the rotational rate @xmath4 of the pulsar . under this assumption ,",
    "the waveforms for the two polarizations @xmath5 are given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle between the pulsar s spin axis and the direction of propagation of the waves , and @xmath8 is the amplitude : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the distance of the star from earth , @xmath11 is the @xmath12-@xmath12 component of the star s moment of inertia with the @xmath12-axis being its spin axis , and @xmath13 is the equatorial ellipticity of the star .",
    "the phase @xmath14 takes its simplest form in the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) frame where it can be expanded in a taylor series .",
    "up to second order : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is time in the ssb frame and @xmath17 is a fiducial start time .",
    "the frequency @xmath18 and the spin - down parameter @xmath19 are defined at this fiducial start time . in this paper , we include only one spin - down parameter in our search , i.e. we ignore the higher order terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasemodel ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable because , as we shall see below in section [ sec : parameters ] , our frequency resolution is too coarse for the higher spindowns to have any effect for reasonable values of the pulsar spindown age .    neglecting relativistic effects which do not affect us significantly in this case ( again because of the coarseness of our frequency resolution ) , the instantaneous frequency @xmath20 of the wave as observed by the detector is given , to a very good approximation , by the familiar non - relativistic doppler formula : @xmath21 where @xmath1 is time in the detector frame , @xmath22 is the velocity of the detector at time @xmath1 , @xmath23 is the direction to the pulsar , @xmath24 is the instantaneous signal frequency at time @xmath1 and is given by @xmath25 equations ( [ eq : master ] ) and ( [ eq : fhat ] ) describe the time - frequency pattern produced by a signal , and this is the pattern that the hough transform is used to look for .",
    "the hough transform was invented by paul hough in 1959 as a method for finding patterns in bubble chamber pictures from cern @xcite and it was later patented by ibm @xcite .",
    "the hough transform is also well known in the literature on pattern recognition to be a robust method for detecting straight lines , circles etc . in digital images ; see e.g. @xcite for a review in this field . a detailed discussion of the hough",
    "transform as applied to the search for continuous gravitational waves can be found in @xcite .",
    "a closely related semi - coherent method is the stack - slide algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the hough transform can be illustrated by the following simple example .",
    "consider the problem of trying to detect straight lines in a noisy two - dimensional digital image .",
    "the digital image is assumed to be made up of pixels which can be in one of only two possible states , namely `` on '' or `` off '' .",
    "let @xmath26 be the coordinates of the center of a typical pixel .",
    "we are looking for a pattern which is parameterized by two numbers @xmath27 such that @xmath28 the parameter space @xmath27 is assumed to be suitably digitized so that it is also made up of pixels . to find the most likely value of @xmath27",
    ", we proceed as follows . for each pixel @xmath29 which is `` on '' , we mark all the possible values of @xmath27 which are consistent with it , i.e. we mark all pixels in the @xmath27 plane lying on the straight line @xmath30 with a `` + 1 '' .",
    "this is repeated for every pixel which is `` on '' .",
    "the end result is an integer , the number count , for every pixel in the @xmath27 plane . in the case when the digital image is too noisy and no straight lines can be detected , the number counts would be uniformly distributed in the @xmath27 place .",
    "the presence of a sufficiently strong signal would lead to a large number count in at least one of the @xmath27 pixels , and the largest number count would indicate the most likely parameter space values .",
    "this method enables us to mark all the possible templates consistent with a given observation without stepping through the parameter space point - by - point .",
    "this leads to a significant gain in computational speed .",
    "furthermore , each observation , no matter how noisy , only adds at the most @xmath31 to the final number count .",
    "these two features are the chief virtues of the hough transform method : computational speed and robustness . on the other hand ,",
    "the hough search is likely to be less sensitive than the stack - slide search considered in @xcite .",
    "the tradeoffs between sensitivity versus efficiency and robustness are yet to be studied in detail and will be important in the context of a hierarchical search @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "the hough transform is used to find a signal whose frequency evolution fits the pattern produced by the doppler shift ( [ eq : master ] ) and the spin - down ( [ eq : fhat ] ) in the time - frequency plane .",
    "the parameters which determine this pattern are @xmath32 ; a point in this four dimensional parameter space will be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "this parameter space is covered by a discrete cubic grid whose resolution is described in section [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "the result of the hough transform is a histogram , i.e. an integer ( the number count ) for each point of this grid .",
    "the starting point for the hough transform are @xmath34 short stretches of fourier transformed data ; each short stretch will be called an sft ( short fourier transform ) .",
    "each of these sfts is `` digitized '' by setting a threshold @xmath35 on the normalized power @xmath36 in the @xmath37 frequency bin : .",
    "@xmath38 here @xmath39 is the value of the fourier transform in the @xmath37 frequency bin corresponding to a frequency @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the time baseline of the sft , and @xmath42 is the single - sided power spectral density of the detector noise at the frequency @xmath40 .",
    "we require that @xmath41 is small enough so that the signal does not shift by more than , say , half a frequency bin within this time duration . for frequencies of @xmath43hz",
    ", this restricts @xmath41 to be lesser than @xmath44min @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we work with sfts for which @xmath45s . in principle",
    ", we could choose @xmath41 to be greater , but we are restricted by the duty cycle of the interferometers in that we should be able to find suitably long time periods during which the detector is in lock .",
    "furthermore , the data should be stationary over the chosen time period .",
    "the choice of @xmath46s is a suitable compromise for all the three interferometers during the s2 run .",
    "this thresholding produces a set of zeros and ones ( called a `` peakgram '' ) from each sft .",
    "this set of peakgrams is the analog of the digitized two - dimensional image described earlier .",
    "the hough transform is used to calculate the number count @xmath47 at each parameter space point starting from this collection of peakgrams .",
    "let @xmath48 be the probability distribution of @xmath47 in the absence of a signal , and @xmath49 the distribution in the presence of a signal @xmath50 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath51 , where @xmath34 is the number of sfts , and it can be shown that for stationary gaussian noise , @xmath48 is a binomial distribution with mean @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the probability that any frequency bin is selected : @xmath54 in the presence of a signal , the distribution is ideally also a binomial but with a slightly larger mean @xmath55 where , for weak signals , @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 @xmath58 is the signal to noise ratio within a single sft , and for the case when there is no mismatch between the signal and the template : @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the fourier transform of the signal @xmath50 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the approximation that the distribution in the presence of a signal is binomial breaks down for reasonably strong signals .",
    "this happens mainly due to two reasons : i ) the random mismatch between the signal and the template used to calculate the number count and ii ) the amplitude modulation of the signal which causes @xmath56 to vary from one sft to another and for different sky locations .",
    "the result of these two effects is to `` smear '' out the binomial distribution in the presence of a signal .",
    "candidates in parameter space are selected by setting a threshold @xmath61 on the number count .",
    "the false alarm and false dismissal rates for this threshold are defined respectively in the usual way : @xmath62 we choose the thresholds @xmath63 based on the neyman - pearson criterion of minimizing @xmath64 for a given value of @xmath65 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this criterion leads , in the case of weak signals ( i.e. @xmath66 ) , large @xmath34 , and gaussian stationary noise , to @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds @xmath68 , i.e. we select about @xmath69 of the frequency bins from each sft ; for weak signals , this turns out to be independent of the choice of @xmath65 and signal strength .",
    "furthermore , @xmath61 is also independent of the signal strength and is given by : @xmath70 where , as before , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the inverse of the complementary error function .",
    "these values of the thresholds lead to a certain value of the false dismissal rate @xmath64 which is given in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath64 of course depends on the signal strength , and it turns out that the weakest signal which will cross the above thresholds at a false alarm rate of @xmath73 and a false dismissal rate of @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 equation ( [ eq : sensitivity ] ) gives the smallest signal which can be detected by the search , and is therefore a measure of the sensitivity of the search .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper correspond to ligo s second science run ( s2 ) that was held for 59 days , from february 14 to april 14 , 2003 .",
    "the geo detector was not running at that time , but all three ligo detectors were operating with a significantly better sensitivity than during the first science run .",
    "the ligo detectors comprise one 4 km facility in livingston , louisiana , ( l1 ) and two , 4 km and 2 km respectively in hanford , washington ( h1 and h2 ) ; see eg .",
    "@xcite . for our purposes",
    ", we note that the duty cycles of the detectors during the s2 run were @xmath76 for l1 , @xmath77 for h1 and @xmath78 for h2 .",
    "the number @xmath34 of @xmath79min sfts available for l1 data were 687 , 1761 for h1 and 1384 for h2 .",
    "figure [ fig : s2sensitivity ] shows the expected sensitivity for the hough search by the three ligo interferometers during the s2 run .",
    "those @xmath8 values correspond to the amplitudes detectable from a generic source with a 1% false alarm rate and 10% false dismissal rate , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sensitivity ] ) significantly over - estimates the sensitivity of the search for unknown pulsars because it does not include the mismatch between the signal and the template .",
    "furthermore , due to the large number of templates involved in the search , a false alarm rate of @xmath73 is too large in practice , and it would result in too many potential candidates . a false alarm rate of @xmath80 would be more realistic since this would lead , in the ideal case , to less than one candidate over the parameter space points considered in this search .    assuming that the gravitational wave emission mechanism is due to deviations of the pulsar s shape from perfect axial symmetry , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",
    "( eq .  ( 2.9 ) in @xcite ) and eq .  (",
    "[ eq : sensitivity ] ) , we can estimate the nominal astrophysical reach of the search for the three detectors : [ eq : range ] d = . for a value of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and for typical parameters of the s2 run",
    ", this corresponds to a distance of about @xmath83-@xmath79 parsecs .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this is not a realistic figure for the astrophysical reach of the search ; it does not consider the mismatch between the template and signal , and it does not use the more realistic false alarm rate mentioned above . due to these effects , it turns out that eq .",
    "( [ eq : range ] ) overestimates the astrophysical reach by a factor of about @xmath84-@xmath85 .",
    "data from each of the three ligo interferometers are used to analyze the same parameter space region .",
    "this section describes the portion of the parameter space @xmath32 that we search over , and the resolution of our grid in this portion of the parameter space .",
    "the total observation time is approximately @xmath86sec corresponding to the s2 science run .",
    "we search for pulsar signals in the frequency range @xmath87-@xmath88hz with a frequency resolution : @xmath89 .",
    "the resolution @xmath90 in the space of first spindown parameters is given by the smallest value of @xmath19 for which the intrinsic signal frequency does not drift by more than a single frequency bin during the total observation time : @xmath91 .",
    "we choose the range of values @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "this yields eleven spin - down values .",
    "all known pulsars ( except for a few supernova remnants ) have spindown parameters less than this value .",
    "this value of @xmath94 is equivalent to looking for pulsars whose spindown age @xmath95 is at least @xmath96 yr .",
    "this also shows that the approximation to drop higher spindown terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasemodel ] ) is reasonable ; with a spindown age of @xmath97 yr as above , we would need a total observation time of @xmath98 yr for the second spindown to cause a frequency drift of half a frequency bin .",
    "the resolution @xmath99 in sky positions is frequency dependent , with the number of templates increasing with frequency and is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is given in eq .",
    "( 4.14 ) of @xcite .",
    "this yields a resolution of about @xmath102rad at @xmath103hz .",
    "this resolution corresponds to @xmath104 sky locations for the whole sky .",
    "the pipeline used to search over this parameter space is described in figure [ fig : pipe ] . the figure is divided into four distinct blocks .",
    "the top - left block is the preparation of the sfts : the data stream is broken up into segments , calibrated , and a discrete fourier transform is applied to each segment .",
    "the calibration connects the error - signal from the interferometer to the actual value of the strain , and this is calculated in the frequency domain .",
    "these sfts are passed onto an optional conditioning step .",
    "this is meant to remove any known spectral disturbances from the sfts . in the present paper , we only present results for which no data conditioning is applied to the sfts .",
    "finally , data from the three interferometers are analysed separately .",
    "the rest of the pipeline consists of two conceptually distinct parts : the actual hough search and the process of setting upper limits .",
    "the hough search has been described earlier ; a threshold is set on the normalized power of each sft , replacing thereby the sfts by a set of peakgrams . in this paper , we only present partial results from this hough search and not the process of setting upper limits in any detail , except to say that this is the conventional frequentist upper limit based using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we set upper limits in each 1hz frequency band , based on the loudest event observed in that band .",
    "this will be presented elsewhere .",
    "as described earlier , the first step in this semi - coherent hough search is to select frequency bins from the sfts by setting a threshold on the normalized power defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : normpower ] ) .",
    "this requires a reliable estimate of the power spectral density @xmath105 for each sft , for which we employ a running median applied to the periodogram of each individual sft .",
    "the running median is a robust method to estimate the noise floor @xcite which has the virtue of discarding outliers which appear in a small number of bins , thereby providing an accurate estimate of the noise floor in the presence of spectral disturbances and possible signals .",
    ".,height=302 ]     for a false alarm @xmath65 of @xmath106 .",
    ", height=264 ]    as an illustrative example , some results of the hough search in a 1 hz frequency band are shown in figure [ fig : stats ] .",
    "the first panel of this figure shows , for every frequency bin , the maximum , minimum , mean and standard deviation of the number counts for all sky - locations and all spindown values .",
    "as expected , the mean is approximately @xmath107 .",
    "similarly , as expected , the standard deviation is @xmath108 .",
    "the second panel of figure [ fig : stats ] shows the distribution of number counts in this band and compares it with the expected binomial distribution in the absence of any signal .",
    "we find excellent agreement with the expected binomial distribution , and this is true in all frequency bands which are relatively free of spectral disturbances .",
    "figure [ fig : l1max ] shows the largest number count obtained for every frequency bin ( i.e. the maximum number count over all sky - locations and spindown values for a given frequency value ) . as this figure shows , several environmental and instrumental noise sources are present .",
    "the sources of these disturbances are mostly understood .",
    "they consist of broad @xmath109hz power lines , multiples of @xmath110hz due to the data acquisition system , and the violin modes of the mirror suspensions in a neighborhood of @xmath111hz .",
    "the 60hz lines are rather broad , with a width of about @xmath112hz , while the 16hz data acquisition lines are confined to a single frequency bin .",
    "in addition to the above disturbances , we also observe a large number of multiples of @xmath113hz .",
    "while these lines are known to be instrumental , their exact physical origin is yet to be determined .",
    "two artificial pulsar signals were injected for a duration of 12 hours at the end of the s2 run into all three ligo interferometers .",
    "these injections were designed to give an end - to - end validation of the search pipeline starting from as far up the observing chain as possible .",
    "the two artificial signals were injected at frequencies of 1279.123hz ( p1 ) and 1288.901hz ( p2 ) with spindown rates of zero and @xmath114hzs@xmath115 respectively , and amplitudes @xmath8 of @xmath116 .",
    "the signals were modulated and doppler shifted to simulate sources at fixed positions on the sky with @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "p1 was injected at a right acsension of 5.147 rad and a declination of 0.3767 rad , while p2 had a right ascension of 2.3457 rad and a declination of 1.2346 rad .",
    "the resolution in the space of sky positions and frequencies are the same as in section [ sec : parameters ] , but the spin - down resolution depends on the total observation time , and this now turns out to be @xmath120 hzs@xmath115 for l1 , @xmath121 hzs@xmath115 for h1 , and @xmath122 hzs@xmath115 for h2 . as before , for each intrinsic frequency we analyze 10 different spin - down values .",
    "the portion of the sky analyzed has a width of @xmath123 radians @xmath124 @xmath123 radians centered around the location of the injected signals .",
    "figure [ fig : injections ] shows some results for pulsar p1 using l1 data . there were 14 sfts available in the duration when",
    "the pulsar was injected .",
    "the top left and top right panels of figure [ fig : injections ] shows hough maps corresponding to the frequency and spin - down values nearest to the injected signal .",
    "although the presence of the signal is clearly visible , 12 hours of observation time is not enough to identify the location of the source in the sky .",
    "in particular , while the signal is identified with a high number count in these hough maps , one can still identify the signal in hough maps corresponding to different frequencies and spindowns with high number - counts , but with a mismatch in the sky location .",
    "this is shown in the bottom left and bottom right panels of [ fig : injections ] .",
    "similar results were found for pulsar p2 and the other detectors , thus providing an important validation of this search pipeline .",
    "in this paper , we have described the idea of the hough search and the search pipeline used to analyze data from the second science run of the ligo interferometers .",
    "we have shown some outputs of the hough search pipeline in the frequency range @xmath87-@xmath88hz , over the whole sky , and the first spindown parameter .",
    "we have also validated the search pipeline by showing that the search can detect hardware injected pulsar signals .",
    "work is in progress to compute astrophysical upper limits using the search pipeline presented in this paper .",
    "the eventual role of the hough transform is in a hierarchical scheme @xcite .",
