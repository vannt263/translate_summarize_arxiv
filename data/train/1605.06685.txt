    "the measured properties of piezoelectric materials are sensitive to the conditions under which they are tested .",
    "traditionally , piezoelectric materials are characterized under low amplitude excitation conditions , which provide different properties than that of large excitation , whose practical applications include popular transducers such as piezoelectric transformers and ultrasonic motors @xcite . therefore , many researchers have taken to study the high power characteristics of piezoelectric materials because the properties at high power levels are more relevant from an application standpoint .",
    "@xcite    the mechanical quality factor ( @xmath7 ) , is among the most critical properties for the design and application of high power piezoelectric transducers .",
    "the mechanical quality factor provides an amplification factor for strain and vibration in resonance conditions .",
    "the inverse of the mechanical quality factor provides a measure of the energy lost per cycle relative to the stored energy due to the hysteresis .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 is a very important parameter to discuss when evaluating a material s high power performance .",
    "the high quality factor , or the `` hardness '' of the industry standard piezoelectric material , lead zirconate titanate ( pzt ) , is achieved by acceptor doping the system and thereby generating internal field to suppress domain dynamics , the largest source of loss in this material system . with the recent environmental concerns due to lead content in pzt and other lead containing piezoelectric materials",
    ", many researchers are searching for lead free piezoelectric materials with a large mechanical quality factor to replace hard pzt for high power applications @xcite .",
    "many researchers have produced various promising materials which might replace pzt and other lead containing materials in high power applications@xcite .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is to clarify a better method to compare the performance of different piezoelectric material systems in high power conditions . in order to compare materials having different sample dimensions ,",
    "the vibration velocity condition has been used .",
    "this methodology is based on the fact that the strain levels between samples with different dimensions are the same if they are under the same vibration velocity condition .",
    "thus , the vibration condition can be used as a common excitation condition to compare results@xcite .",
    "this , however , only applies to samples having the same mode of vibration .",
    "for example , the radial vibration mode of a disc sample ( @xmath3 ) and the longitudinal vibration of a plate / bar sample ( @xmath2 ) can not be compared directly based on vibration velocity , as detailed in @xcite .    comparing material properties",
    "based on vibration velocity seems natural , as it an easy to recognize its significance , and materials properties measured on samples having different dimensions can be compared .",
    "however , comparing the @xmath7 performance of material systems simply based on vibration velocity is not a complete solution .",
    "the first reason is already mentioned : the disc and the plate sample can not be compared .",
    "this will be explained in greater detail in the next section , but to summarize the reason , the vibration velocity distribution profiles have different shapes .",
    "the second reason is that vibration velocity , although is not dependent on the size of the sample , is dependent on the stiffness or the density of the sample .",
    "it is simple to tell that a material with a higher mass density must have a higher mechanical energy to reach the same vibration velocity than a material with a lower mass density .",
    "however , simply judging from a vibration velocity perspective , both situations are equal .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to prove analytically that vibration velocity alone may result in misleading conclusions when directly used to compare between material systems .",
    "rather a new measure of excitation , mechanical energy density should be used .",
    "this methodology is demonstrated using published data from different material compositions in the literature .",
    "the second goal of this work is to show that energy density can be effectively used to determine anisotropic properties in high power conditions by providing a similar comparison metric between different piezoelectric resonators used to determine properties .",
    "in this section , the non - dimensional quantity , mechanical energy density , will be presented to normalize the dependence of @xmath8 on material vibration performance .",
    "the mechanical energy will be expressed in terms of the maximum kinetic energy instead of the maximum elastic energy because the compliance of the materials undergo nonlinearities , whereas the mass density does not , thereby simplifying the calculations for practical measurements .",
    ".parameter definitions[tab : parameter - definitions ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : change - in - mechanical energy density ] shows the change in the mechanical quality factor as a change in the mechanical energy density .",
    "the end of each of the curves has a tip vibration velocity of 1 m / s , except nkn whose is 0.57 m / s . using mechanical energy density , the vibration velocity for each system is effectively normalized with its density and vibration mode . looking at this figure , it is apparent that the quality factor of kn no longer exceeds that of pzt for any mechanical energy condition .",
    "this is because after taking into consideration the low mass density of kn , its performance becomes less significant .",
    "bnt - bt - bnmn exceeds the quality factor of pzt at a mechanical energy condition of 850 @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to the vibration velocity condition of 0.76 m / s for bnt - bt - bnmn and 0.64 m / s for pzt .",
    "bnklt exceeds the quality factor of pzt for mechanical energy densities of higher than 700 @xmath9 , which corresponds to a vibration condition of 0.64 m / s for bnklt and 0.55 m / s for pzt , which is different from the conclusion which could be made from figure [ fig : change - in - mechanical vibration ] , where the @xmath7 of bnklt exceeded that of pzt at 0.5 m / s .",
    "nkn exceeded the quality factor of the pzt at 540 @xmath9 , which is equivalent to 0.56 m / s for nkn and 0.53 m / s for pzt .",
    "the general trend observed is that the quality factor of the lead - free materials does not suffer from the sharp degradation as the commercial pzt sample does . as a result , although the mechanical quality factors of the lead - free materials are lower at low vibration velocities , they are higher past a sufficiently high mechanical excitation level . for all of the @xmath2 samples , the equivalent mechanical energy density condition resulted in a larger vibration velocity for the lighter lead - free sample rather than the more dense pzt . because the energy density takes into account mass density when calculating the performance level , the performance of pzt is apparently enhanced because of its large density .",
    "a larger vibration velocity is required from the lighter lead - free materials to reach the equivalent vibration velocity for the heavier pzt . with regards to nkn , the @xmath3 sample , the equivalent mechanical energy density condition yields an almost identical vibration velocity for the pzt and the nkn material system .",
    "this is because , the lighter density of nkn reduces its relative performance to the more dense pzt , but the mode of vibration of the nkn sample ( @xmath3 ) increases its performance .",
    "that being said , the density or the vibration mode does not actually enhance or the increase the degradation characteristics of the material .",
    "in fact , the mechanical energy density approach presented allows one to remove their effects and to compare material properties in a better justified manner .    the purpose of this section was to demonstrate the observations made comparing @xmath7 performance as a function of vibration velocity and as a function of mechanical energy density will be different .",
    "comparison of the @xmath7 degradation of materials using vibration velocity as the common condition has limitations , as was discussed .",
    "although general trends seen using vibration velocity as the figure of merit still hold true when observing the mechanical quality factor with regard to mechanical energy density , relative material performance can best be evaluated when utilizing mechanical energy density as the common comparison condition .      the energy density versus @xmath10 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy density ] for hard and soft pzt of @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonator geometries .",
    "this data was taken using the burst method operated at antiresonance .",
    "after accounting for the energy density of each mode type ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and the mass density of the material , the quality factors of both modes agree , showing they are comparable between different modes .",
    "previously , it may have seemed as though the @xmath3 degrades quickly ; however , this is due to the increased energy density stored per unit of vibration velocity .",
    "that being said , the @xmath3 mode s energy potential is omnidirectional in the plane of vibration , which may make it difficult to apply this resonator in devices .",
    "however , in applications such as structural health monitoring and piezoelectric transformers , this feature can be effectively utilized , in which case it is important to be able to compare the modes .",
    "anisotropy is a fundamental quality of piezoelectric materials , which implies that losses are also anisotropic .",
    "thus , although the quality factor for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes in this analysis were of similar levels , it is not possible to assume this generalize to all crystalline piezoelectric ceramics .",
    "analysis of the mechanical quality factor ( @xmath7 ) as a function of vibration velocity is typically used to compare the high power behavior of piezoelectric materials . using vibration velocity as a figure of merit might be misleading if distinctly different materials and vibration modes are compared . in this paper , a new figure of merit is introduced to compare high power behavior of different piezoelectric materials : mechanical energy density .",
    "the formulas describing the mechanical energy density were solved for longitudinal vibration ( @xmath11 ) and radial vibration ( @xmath3 ) type transducers .",
    "the new analysis method was applied to data regarding lead - free ( i.e. kn , bnklt , bnt - bt - bnmn , nkn ) and lead - based ( hard pzt ) piezoelectric materials found in the literature . analyzing mechanical quality factor as a function mechanical energy density gave different conclusions than analyzing it with regard to vibration velocity . when analyzing @xmath7 behavior versus vibration velocity , all lead - free ceramics surpassed hard - pzt . however , when analyzing @xmath7 behavior versus mechanical energy lead - free ceramics @xmath7 the trends observed differed . as a result",
    ", comparing the high power of behavior of different materials with mechanical energy density provides a better standard of comparison between different materials and different sample geometries than vibration velocity .",
    "this is because mechanical energy density accounts for the mass density of the material system and also accounts for type of vibration , thereby normalizing vibration velocity to mechanical energy density .",
    "the mechanical energy density approach is necessary to compare mechanical loss in piezoelectric ceramics for different material systems and vibration modes .",
    "finally , the energy density concept was applied to hard and soft pzt materials of @xmath3 and @xmath2 resonator geometries .",
