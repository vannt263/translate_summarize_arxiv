    "this could explain why the fit with generalized gumbel distributions whose negative tail is a simple exponential @xmath80 with exponent @xmath81 and coefficient @xmath82 leads to increasing effective values of @xmath82 when the range over which the tail is measured grows : the fit with simple scaling data on @xmath83 leads to @xmath84 @xcite , whereas the importance scaling data on @xmath85 leads to a completely different estimate @xmath86 @xcite .",
