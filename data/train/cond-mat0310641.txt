    "the question of mutual influence of long range coulomb interactions and disorder in two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) attracted a great attention after an unexpected discovery of metallic state and clear metal - insulator transition by kravchenko and coworkers .",
    "@xcite the very existence of a metallic state with finite conductivity at zero temperature is in conflict with the weak localization theory , @xcite which predicts that in 2d even negligible amount of disorder localizes electrons at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "the theory however was firmly established at weak coupling or for short range interactions only , while the metallic state exists and the transition was found for rather strong coupling @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average interaction energy per electron and @xmath2 is the fermi energy . therefore coulomb interactions dominate the kinetic energy and can not be considered `` small '' .",
    "in addition to an obvious difficulty to treat quantitatively or even qualitatively the strong coupling , it is not clear which one , disorder or coulomb interactions , should be considered as a most important cause of the transition to an insulating state ( the corresponding insulating state in these cases is of `` anderson '' or `` mott '' type @xcite ) .",
    "most probably it results from a nontrivial combination of these interactions .",
    "the standard approach starts with a commonly accepted argument that a long range coulomb interaction after bubble resummation  of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) type @xcite becomes effectively short range .",
    "therefore one can start the treatment of disorder after this resummation was performed .",
    "disorder is treated within a similar approach in which rainbow  diagrams @xcite ladders and crossed ladders resummation  @xcite ( or , more systematically , the steepest descent  approximations @xcite in the path integrals language @xcite ) with interaction being already short ranged . in this way",
    "two kinds of massless modes determining the properties of the disordered electron gas are identified : diffusons ( describing diffusive nature of the electron motion due to impurities ) and cooperons in the particle - particle channel .",
    "it is the last which lead to weak localization due to logarithmic infrared ( ir ) divergences in leading fluctuation contribution to conductivity @xcite ( diffusons can also lead to ir divergences at yet higher orders @xcite ) @xmath3,\\]]where @xmath4 is a free system relaxation time .    more sophisticated renormalization group ( rg ) based methods using path integral  @xcite and @xmath5 - models  wegner , pruisken , hikami with coulomb interactions @xcite  were developed .",
    "considering high order vertex renormalization , it was found that there are additional logarithmic ir ( aronov - altshuler aronov ) divergencies:@xmath6,\\]]where @xmath7 the fermi surface average of the screened coulomb interaction , leading to a conclusion that long interactions increase tendency to weak localization .",
    "@xcite this leads to a difficulty in understanding recent experiments in which apparently interactions do not necessarily lead to rapid increase of resistivity .",
    "recent detailed experimental studies @xcite clearly show that near the putative metal - insulator transition logarithmic terms either are suppressed or cancel each other ( several arguments were put forward in ref .   against such a fortuitous cancellation ) .",
    "the conductivity dependence on temperature follows the gold - dolgopolov s gold linear decrease , which at higher temperatures crosses over to the ballistic regime studied in detail recently in ref .  .",
    "generally within this approach the coulomb interaction is screened first and the disorder effects are treated later .",
    "however recent electron spin resonance experiment @xcite demonstrated that the screening length rapidly diverges when density is reduced towards the transition point . the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level vanishes .",
    "it was noticed long time ago @xcite that the diffusive motion of electrons slows down the process of screening .",
    "therefore in the limit of small density and when which disorder seems to play an important and possibly crucial role , it is reasonable to start from an approximation in which the interaction is not rendered short range .    with these experimental facts in mind ,",
    "we reconsider the question of the inter - relation of disorder and coulomb interactions in 2deg within a single consistent systematic approach without replacing it by a short range potential from the beginning as is done in the clean limit or high density .",
    "the necessarily nonperturbative approach consists of two steps .",
    "first is a variational one ( nonperturbative in coupling ) and is similar in spirit the hartree - fock for clean metals or the bcs approximation in superconducting metals .",
    "we find in section ii the bestquadratic hamiltonian representing the system . on this set of hamiltonians a quasiparticle ( and quasi - hole ) green function",
    "is a variational parameter .",
    "there are possible contributions in the particle - particle ( cooper pairs ) as well as the particle - hole channels due to coulomb interactions ( hartree state in direct and fock state in exchange channel ) , while interactions with disorder can be treated in a similar manner with the frequency dependent relaxation time being one of the variational parameters . possible condensates in several channels do not realize : of course there is no condensate in the coopper channel for a repulsive interaction and there is also no condensation in the direct channel due to the charge neutrality as is shown in section iia .",
    "however the strong long range exchange interaction creates ( even in the clean case @xcite ) a dip in the dos on the fermi surface . at",
    "infinitely strong coupling the dos on the fermi surface approaches zero ( to avoid confusion , this reduction is not related to the one found at higher orders for screened interaction in ref .  ,",
    "see discussion of this topic in section ivd ) .",
    "this makes the electron liquid very rigid and , as a result , the effects of disorder are greatly suppressed .",
    "this in turn leads to increase in conductivity at large coupling .",
    "the emergence of the above phenomenon can already be seen on perturbative level .",
    "the first order quasiparticle energy shift due to exchange is:@xmath8it is easily shown ( section iib ) that for purely repulsive @xmath9 energy of states above the fermi level is shifted up , while energy of states below the fermi level is shifted down .",
    "the logarithmic vanishing of the dos is a direct consequence of the long range nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is important to note that the significant reduction of the dos near the fermi level does not mean that the effective mass is smaller than the band effective mass . on the contrary",
    ", it was shown in the clean case tk , jang that despite this the effective mass grows with coupling as was observed recently in shubnikov - de haas experiments .",
    "@xcite we comment more on that in section iib .",
    "after the variational quadratic hamiltonian ( or variational quadratic action in the path integral formalism ) is found , we introduce in section iiia a systematic perturbation theory around it . in the path",
    "integral language negele , belitz it is a conventional steepest descent  expansion with the variational action as a saddle point .",
    "first we introduce fields describing various possible kinds of fluctuations : diffusons , cooperons , static photons ( corresponding to the direct coulomb interaction channel ) , the exchange and the cooper channel interactions .",
    "the last two are evidently massive as well as half of diffusons and cooperons .",
    "@xcite however we find that there is a nontrivial mixing between photons and diffusons .",
    "the phenomenon is very reminiscent of the anderson - higgs mechanism in superconductivity anderson in which massless goldstone boson of phase is mixing with ( dynamical ) photon . as a result",
    "both modes become massive . in the case of",
    "strongly coupled 2deg the modes are not really massive , the density - density correlator describing diffuson becoming `` harder'':@xmath10compared to the noninteracting diffusion pole@xmath11the ( static ) photon becomes rpa screened:@xmath12the renormalized diffusion constant @xmath13 increases ( nonperturbatively ) with coupling from its noninteracting value of @xmath14 .",
    "similarly the renormalized relaxation time @xmath15 increases with @xmath16    equation  ( [ difprop ] ) implies that electrons at large distances are no longer diffusive : they obey diffusion equation with first space derivative only .",
    "the cooperon on the other hand still retains its typical diffusivepole form eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) .",
    "the approximation scheme at higher orders therefore nontrivially combines the rpa and the disorder resummation on the same footing .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the scheme is manifestly gauge invariant . as was shown in refs .",
    ", that it is very important to ensure gauge invariance at each stage in order not to miss important vertex corrections  necessary to ensure charge conservation at each order of the expansion including the variational stage .",
    "next in section iv we turn to the fluctuation corrections  leading to weak localization .",
    "the leading fluctuation correction to conductivity is infrared divergent .",
    "however , as the coupling @xmath17 grows , the correction grows slower than the main ( drude ) contribution .",
    "this justifies the expansion even for small values of @xmath18 at which the standard @xmath19 expansion is invalid ( @xmath20 is however required ) .",
    "therefore the crossover temperature at which conductivity starts approaching zero is significantly lower than that for non - interacting electrons .",
    "this temperature is estimated as a temperature at which the perturbation theory in fluctuations breaks down , namely when the correction becomes a significant fraction of the leading order contribution .",
    "the crossover temperature , according to our analysis becomes unobservably small since it vanishes exponentially fast with coupling ( due to logarithmic dependence of the fluctuation correction on temperature serving as an ir cutoff ) . therefore one can practically ( for samples of finite albeit large size ) talk about stable metallic state in 2deg",

    "it was claimed that this is precisely what was observed in tunnelling junction experiments in disordered metal films .",
    "@xcite in our approach , due to anderson - higgs mechanism , this renormalization is greatly reduced .",
    "an alternative explanation at very strong coupling and significant disorder might be the leading order reduction of dos discussed in section iid , see fig .",
    "this does not contradicts the experiments in metals since in these experiments disorder is large ( even very large ) , while the coupling @xmath17 is quite small .",
    "of course if the density is sufficiently high the screening can no longer be neglected and the aronov - altshuler s effect becomes dominant . however , as we mentioned before , in very clean 2deg samples the disorder can reduce the screening and our approach of neglecting the screening at the leading order becomes more appropriate . in this case",
    "higher orders will not be large enough to undermine this assumption .",
    "one will get again a reduction in the dos , but for entirely different reason .",
    "a related issue is emergence of the coulomb gap commented on in the next section .",
    "to summarize we present a consistent gauge invariant approach to disordered strongly interacting electron gas in 2d .",
    "physically the basic phenomenon is the reduction in the dos at fermi level due to strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "this in turn suppresses both screening and scattering of impurities stabilizing the metallic state against weak localization effects .",
    "formally the approach consists of two steps .",
    "the first is variational ( or `` self consistent '' ) : the most general quadratic states were considered and one with minimal energy identified . at this stage",
    "the `` rpa '' screening is neglected assuming it is sufficiently weakened by disorder so that higher orders are small .",
    "the second step is steepest descent perturbative expansion ( which also can be identified as an expansion in parameter @xmath111 with @xmath124 number of spin components or valleys ) .",
    "although the general philosophy of the steepest descent expansion is not drastically different from the one adopted in other works ( see for example ref .  ) , two rather independent observations were made .",
    "the first is that the exchange part of coulomb interaction leads at strong coupling to a significant reduction of the dos near the fermi surface and to via the reduction suppresses the disorder effects .",
    "the second is that when the steepest descent expansion procedure , if followed consistently , mixing between static photons and diffusons not only causes debye screening of the photon , but leads in addition to a softening of the diffusion pole .",
    "this in turn leads to a number of observable consequences like a significant modification of the vertex part and consequently of the aronov - altshuler contribution to conductivity .",
    "the contribution becomes regular in the strong coupling , not logarithmic ( the absence of the effect of the dos reduction due to interaction in ref .",
    "17 can be traced to an approximate calculation of the exchange diagram in their eq .",
    "( 16 ) ) .    in this section",
    "we discuss several general questions and assumptions and relation of our work to other attempts to incorporate the long range coulomb interactions into the theory of disordered electron gas .",
    "the theory of disordered electron gas relies to large extent on existence of massless collective modes , diffusons and cooperons .",
    "it is tempting to interpret these excitations as goldstone bosons of some symmetry breaking ( with several complications arising from the quenched disorder , see ref .  ) .",
    "the @xmath5 model approach initiated by wegner wegner and others @xcite long ago and developed and applied to the coulomb interaction case recently by baranov et al .",
    "baranov start from and assumption that the @xmath125 symmetry of free disordered electron gas is spontaneously broken down to diagonal subgroup @xmath126 where @xmath127 enumerates replica , spin and matsubara indices .",
    "we have shown in section iii however that diffusons mix with photon and become `` harder '' than standard goldstone bosons .",
    "this might signal that the @xmath5 - model approach should be modified to incorporate the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "actually the need for such a modification can be found in recent remarkable work of ref .",
    "and we comment on this now .",
    "unfortunately the presence of strong coulomb interactions explicitly breaks a subgroup of @xmath128 .",
    "an example of the explicitly broken symmetry transformation is @xmath129 @xmath130 for positive matsubara frequencies @xmath131 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 for negative matsubara frequencies @xmath134the symmetry is broken by both the frequency term @xmath135 and by the coulomb interaction term .",
    "however while the breaking by the frequency term is `` soft '' and insignificant , as far as static quantities like dc conductivity are concerned , it was shown @xcite that the coulomb interaction effectively represented on the @xmath5 - model level by the `` square of trace '' operator  ( eq .  ( 2.1 ) in ref .  )",
    "is relevant and can not be reduced to a soft breaking .",
    "baranov et al .",
    "notice that at large distances the diffusion is suppressed which coincides with our eq .",
    "( [ diffuson ] ) . at short",
    "distance scales the electrons are diffusive .",
    "we believe that the anderson - higgs mechanism can be treated approximately within the @xmath5 - model approach as long as the mixing is small .",
    "this is well known problem in quantum field theory @xcite under the name of `` gauged @xmath5 - models '' .",
    "these issues might become clearer when the present approach is extended beyond 2d ( say to @xmath136 ) .",
    "work on this is in progress .",
    "a related issue is understanding the difference between diffusons and cooperons . within the @xmath5- model approach the @xmath137 symmetry forces the cooperon and the diffuson propagators to be same .",
    "it is precisely an explicit ( not spontaneous ) symmetry breaking due to coulomb interactions that makes the hardening of the diffuson ( mixing with photon ) , while leaving cooperon intact possible .",
    "the fact that coulomb interaction modifies diffusion at large distances was also discussed in ref .   and this might lead also to suppression of weak localization .",
    "the work however was criticized , sicomment , baranov , aleiner that the vertex parts were not taken into account or alternatively the treatment is not gauge invariant .",
    "our work explicitly shows that despite the fact that diffuson is `` harder '' ( although still massless ) at large distances , the cooperon is not .",
    "therefore although weak localization is suppressed , the suppression is much weaker and completely different .",
    "the logarithmically divergent contribution to conductivity includes cooperon .",
    "it was shown by efros and shklovskii @xcite on basis of a heuristic argument with  plausible assumptions about the nature of the localized electronic states ( neglecting their overlaps ) that there should be a coulomb gap in the strongly interacting electron gas .",
    "as in the case of @xmath5 models with coulomb interactions , @xcite it is not clear from the first orders in our scheme whether the reduction of the density of state is along the line of their argument .",
    "we believe this is unlikely due to the fact that they neglect the effect of exchange on the `` states '' @xmath138 defined there .",
    "it is also not clear at this point whether the opening of coulomb gap that baranov et al .",
    "@xcite deduce on the basis of the @xmath139 expansion is related to the reduction in density of states due to exchange .",
    "one can extend the approach presented here to the `` self consistent '' scheme initiated by vollhardt and developed to include coulomb interactions by sadovsky .",
    "@xcite this will allow quantitative study of the insulating state and of the coulomb gap .",
    "note however that the `` gap '' equations of ref .",
    "follow the perturbative aronov - altshuler contributions , while the `` self consistent '' form of our conductivity contributions eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) will contain different diagrams .",
    "the work on this is in progress .",
    "at last we briefly comment on two general assumptions made .",
    "the first is the spatial homogeneity .",
    "it is clear @xcite that clean and even disordered 2deg @xcite at sufficiently strong coupling become inhomogeneous wigner crystals or `` glass '' .",
    "it was even speculated chakravarty that the wigner crystallization ( which occurs around @xmath140 in clean systems ) might be related to the observed metal - insulator transition . following general argument",
    "can be advanced against such a scenario .",
    "it has been observed recently that in several clean systems of thermally fluctuating repelling objects the homogeneous state ( liquid or gas ) exists down to zero temperature .",
    "one such a system is one component classical plasma .",
    "@xcite another is a system of vortex lines in type ii superconductors . @xcite the latter is quite analogous to 2deg .",
    "the difference is that thermal fluctuations should be replaced by quantum and bosonic field by fermionic ( statistics is quite unimportant in the low density limit though ) . to be sure the energy of the solid is lower , so below the melting point the liquid state is metastable ( in conventional liquids",
    "for which in addition to repulsive interaction there is a long range attractive force , the metastable state ceases to exist at spinodal point ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume ( and it was demonstrated recently @xcite ) that disorder favors homogeneous state over a structured crystal ) .",
    "therefore transition to a wigner crystal or glass state would occur at much higher couplings than metal - insulator transition and the relevant state is homogeneous as was assumed in the present paper .",
    "another assumption commonly made is that the replica symmetry used to derive our starting point eq .",
    "( [ aspin ] ) was assumed to be unbroken .",
    "this means that we neglected a possibility of `` electron glass '' .",
    "@xcite this is a distant possibility in the quasimetallic state since , as we argued in the paper , reduction in the dos due to long range interactions make disorder less favored . eventually in the insulating state glassy behaviors will eventually prevail .",
