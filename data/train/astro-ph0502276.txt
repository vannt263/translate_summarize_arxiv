    "trojans are planetesimals that trace tadpole - shaped trajectories around one of two triangular equilibrium points ( lagrange points ) established by their host planet ( lagrange 1873 ; murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "they are said to inhabit the 1:1 resonance because they execute one orbit about the sun for every orbit that their host planet makes , staying an average of @xmath160@xmath3 forwards or backwards of the planet s orbital longitude .",
    "the lagrange points represent potential maxima in the frame rotating with the planet s mean orbital frequency .",
    "the coriolis force renders trojan motion dynamically stable , while dissipative forces ( such as introduced by inter - trojan collisions ) that reduce the energy in the rotating frame cause trojans to drift from their potential maxima and to escape the resonance .. ] best known are the jupiter trojans : two clouds of rocky , icy bodies that flank the gas giant and whose sizes range up to that of ( 624 ) hektor , which has a characteristic radius @xmath4 ( barucci et al .",
    "2002 ; marzari et al .  2002 ; jewitt , sheppard , & porco 2004 ) .",
    "the number of kilometer - sized jupiter trojans may exceed that of similarly sized main belt asteroids ( jewitt , trujillo , & luu 2000 ) .",
    "recently , the first neptune trojan , 2001 qr@xmath0 ( hereafter `` qr '' ) , was discovered by the deep ecliptic survey ( des ) , an observational reconnaissance of the kuiper belt at optical wavelengths ( chiang et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter c03 ) . this hektor - sized object librates ( oscillates ) about neptune s forward lagrange ( l4 ) point and vindicates long - standing theoretical beliefs in the dynamical stability of neptune trojans ( holman & wisdom 1993 ; nesvorny & dones 2002 ) .",
    "billion - year - long orbital integrations of possible trajectories of qr robustly indicate stability and suggest that the object has inhabited the 1:1 resonance for the age of the solar system , @xmath5 ( c03 ; marzari , tricarico , & scholl 2003 ; brasser et al .",
    "extrapolation of the total population of neptune trojans based on the amount of sky surveyed by the des indicates that neptune trojans resembling qr may be 1030 times as numerous as their jovian counterparts ( c03 ) .",
    "if so , their surface mass density would approach that of the current main kuiper belt to within a factor of a few [ e.g. , bernstein et al .",
    "2004 ; see also equations ( [ gmin1 ] ) and ( [ gmin2 ] ) of this paper ] .    here",
    "we investigate the origin of neptune trojans . unlike other resonant kuiper belt objects ( 3:2 , 2:1 , 5:2 , etc . )",
    "whose existence may be explained by the outward migration of neptune in the primordial disk of planetesimals and concomitant resonance trapping ( malhotra 1995 ; chiang & jordan 2002 ; murray - clay & chiang 2004 ) , neptune trojans do not owe their genesis to migration . as a planet migrates on timescales much longer than the local orbital period",
    ", it scatters neighboring planetesimals onto extremely elongated and inclined orbits by repeated close encounters ( c03 ; gomes 2003 ) .",
    "such scattering might explain the large velocity dispersions  eccentricities and inclinations with respect to the invariable plane ranging up to @xmath10.2 and @xmath10.5 rad , respectively  observed in the main kuiper belt today ( see , e.g. , elliot et al .",
    "2005 ; gomes 2003 ) .",
    "by contrast , the orbit of qr is nearly circular and nearly co - planar with the invariable plane ; its eccentricity and inclination are @xmath10.03 and @xmath10.02 rad , respectively . in simulations of migration and resonance",
    "trapping executed by c03 , the sweeping 1:1 resonance fails to trap a single test particle . instead",
    ", neptune s migration may destabilize neptune trojans .",
    "passage of neptune trojans through sweeping secondary resonances with uranus and the other giant planets can reduce the trojan population by nearly 2 orders of magnitude ( gomes 1998 ; kortenkamp , malhotra , & michtchenko 2004 ) .",
    "do jupiter trojans offer any insight into the formation of neptune trojans ?",
    "morbidelli et al .  (",
    "2004 ) propose that in the early planetesimal disk , jupiter trojans are captured as jupiter and saturn migrate divergently across their mutual 2:1 resonance ( see also chiang 2003 for a more general discussion of divergent resonance crossings ) .",
    "while jupiter and saturn occupy the 2:1 resonance , jupiter s 1:1 resonance is unstable ; planetesimals stream through trojan libration regions on orbits that tend to be highly inclined due to planetary perturbations .",
    "once the planets depart the 2:1 resonance , stability returns to the 1:1 resonance . at this moment , planetesimals that happen to be passing though trojan libration regions are trapped there , effectively instantaneously .",
    "this `` freeze - in '' scenario promises to explain the large orbital inclinations  up to @xmath10.6 rad  exhibited by jupiter trojans , in addition to saturn s observed orbital eccentricity of @xmath10.05 which might result from the planets resonance crossing .",
    "while we can not rule out that neptune trojans did not also form by freeze - in , analogous motivating observations are absent : the orbital inclination of qr is low ; divergent crossing of the 2:1 resonance by uranus and neptune may cause neptune s eccentricity to exceed its observed value of @xmath10.01 by a factor of @xmath13 ; and finally , the stability of plutinos and other resonantly trapped kuiper belt objects is threatened by planetary resonance crossing ( gomes 2001 ) .",
    "another motivation for studying neptune trojans is to infer the formation environment of the host ice giant .",
    "neptune s formation is the subject of substantial current research because traditional estimates of the planet s accretion timescale are untenably longer than @xmath6 ( thommes , levison , & duncan 1999 ; goldreich , lithwick , & sari  2004 , hereafter gls04 ) . as planetesimals that share neptune s orbit ,",
    "neptune trojans may hold clues as to how their host planet assembled .",
    "their composition probably reflects that of neptune s rock / ice interior .",
    "we quantitatively develop and assess the viability of three theories for the origin of qr - like objects :    1 .",
    "pull - down capture , whereby mass accretion of the host planet converts a planetesimal s orbit into tadpole - type libration .",
    "direct collisional emplacement , whereby initially non - resonant , qr - sized objects are diverted into 1:1 resonance by physical collisions .",
    "3 .   _ in situ _ accretion , whereby qr - sized bodies form by accretion of much smaller seed particles comprising a trojan sub - disk in the solar nebula .",
    "seed particles are presumed to be inserted into resonance as debris from collisions between planetesimals .",
    "the problem of accretion in the trojan sub - disk is akin to the standard problem of planet formation , transplanted from the usual heliocentric setting to an l4/l5-centric environment .",
    "peale ( 1993 ) analyzes trapping of jupiter trojans by nebular gas drag .",
    "we do not consider gas dynamics since the outer solar system after the time of neptune s formation was gas - depleted , almost certainly due to photo - evaporation by ultraviolet radiation from the young sun ( e.g. , matsuyama , johnstone , & hartmann 2003 , and references therein ) . by mass , neptune comprises only @xmath1418% hydrogen and helium ( lodders & fegley 1998 ) .    while the three mechanisms we examine are not mutually exclusive , the requirements and predictions that each makes independent of the others differ .",
    "faced with only a single known example of a neptune trojan and limited data concerning its physical properties , we wield order - of - magnitude physics as our weapon of choice .",
    "many of our simple estimates prove surprisingly illuminating .    in  [ basic ] , we review the collisionless dynamics of trojans and supply relations and terminology that will be used in remaining sections . observed and theoretically inferred",
    "properties of neptune trojans requiring explanation are listed in  [ character ] .",

    ", we argue against pull - down capture as the primary channel for formation . in  [ deposit ] , we quantify and assess the plausibility of demands that direct collisional emplacement places on the planetesimal disk . in ",
    "[ insitu ] , we demonstrate how _ in situ _ accretion can correctly reproduce the inferred number of qr - sized neptune trojans . in ",
    "[ conclude ] , we summarize our findings and point out directions for future observational and theoretical work .",
    "we review the motions of trojans hosted by a planet on a circular orbit to establish simple relations used throughout this paper .",
    "some of the material in this section is derived in standard textbooks ( e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "exceptions include trojan - trojan relative motion and the variation of libration period with tadpole size , topics that we develop ourselves .",
    "figure [ f1 ] illustrates qr s trajectory : a combination of epicyclic and guiding center motion in the frame co - rotating with the planet .",
    "the trojan completes each ellipse - shaped epicycle ( `` corkscrew turn '' ) in an orbit time ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the object s and the host planet s orbital angular frequencies , respectively .",
    "projected onto the host planet s orbit plane , the epicycle s major and minor axes align with the azimuthal and radial directions , respectively .",
    "the ratio of semi - axis lengths is @xmath10 : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the osculating eccentricity and orbital semi - major axis of the trojan , and @xmath14 is the orbital semi - major axis of the host planet .",
    "the guiding center of the epicycle loops around the lagrange point every libration period ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the ratio of neptune s mass to the sun s .",
    "this analytic expression for @xmath17 is given by linear stability analysis and is independent of the size of the guiding center orbit .",
    "we supply a more precise formula that depends on orbit size in  [ anharm ] .",
    "the guiding center traces approximately an extremely elongated ellipse ( `` tadpole '' ) centered on the lagrange point and having a radial : azimuthal aspect ratio of @xmath18 : @xmath19 , as depicted in figure [ nordicell ] .",
    "the semi - minor axis of the largest possible tadpole has a length of    @xmath20    this length equals the greatest possible difference between the osculating semi - major axes of the trojan and of the host planet .      consider two trojans moving initially on pure tadpole orbits with zero epicyclic amplitudes ( figure [ nordicell ] , bottom solid and open circles ) .",
    "a `` close '' conjunction between the bodies occurs with radial separation @xmath21 , at a location away from the turning points of either tadpole orbit and at a time when both bodies are moving in the same direction .",
    "the dynamics during the conjunction are , to good approximation , like those of a conjunction between two bodies on circular keplerian orbits in the absence of the planet .",
    "that is , the relative velocity is @xmath1@xmath22 and therefore the duration of the encounter is @xmath1@xmath23 .",
    "we have verified that this is the case by numerical orbit integrations .",
    "close conjunctions occur twice per libration period , radially inside and outside the l4 point .",
    "we define a synodic time ,    @xmath24    between successive close conjunctions .",
    "two bodies separated by a radial distance @xmath21 and an azimuthal distance @xmath25 undergo close conjunctions every @xmath26 .",
    "if the libration period , @xmath17 , were truly independent of tadpole size , two bodies undergoing close conjunctions would undergo them indefinitely ; two conjunctions would occur at the same locations with respect to l4 every libration period .. ] in fact , anharmonicity of the perturbation potential causes the libration period to grow with tadpole size .",
    "we calculate numerically the deviation ,    @xmath27    as a function of tadpole semi - minor axis , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the libration period for @xmath30 .",
    "we integrate , via the burlirsch - stoer algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) , test particle orbits having virtually zero epicyclic amplitudes ( @xmath31 ) in the presence of a binary of mass ratio @xmath32 and orbital eccentricity @xmath33 .",
    "the numerically computed value of @xmath29 matches that calculated from our analytic expression ( [ alib ] ) to within 1 part in @xmath34 .",
    "the result for @xmath35 , documented in figure [ tadshear ] , may be fitted to a power law ,    @xmath36    the anharmonicity is never strong ; @xmath37 .",
    "this `` anharmonic shear '' permits phase differences to accumulate between neighboring trojans .",
    "close conjunctions occur for a finite number of libration periods ; eventually , close conjunctions give way to `` distant '' conjunctions that occur when both bodies are moving in opposite directions on radially opposite sides of l4 ( figure [ nordicell ] , top open and solid circles ) .",
    "each cycle of close - distant - close conjunctions lasts for a time ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the minimum ( radial ) distance between neighboring tadpole orbits . for a typical value of @xmath40 , this `` grand synodic time '' takes a simple form :    @xmath41    which is similar to , but of order 10 times longer than , the ordinary synodic time in a circular keplerian disk away from resonance ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the time spent undergoing close conjunctions , @xmath43 , is shorter than @xmath44 by the ratio of @xmath45 to the circumference of a trojan s guiding center orbit :    @xmath46    independent of @xmath21 .",
    "the number of conjunctions that occur during this `` stirred '' phase is @xmath47 .      to summarize the behavior described in sections   [ epimotion][anharm ] : for a time @xmath43 , two neighboring trojans whose underlying tadpole orbits have semi - minor axes ( measured relative to l4 ) of @xmath28 and @xmath48 undergo close conjunctions .",
    "these conjunctions occur every @xmath49 , and are like ordinary conjunctions between bodies on circular orbits outside of resonance .",
    "in particular , an individual conjunction , during which the distance between guiding centers is @xmath1@xmath21 , lasts @xmath1@xmath23 .",
    "the number of conjunctions that occur during this stirred phase is typically @xmath50 .",
    "after @xmath43 time elapses , sufficient phase accumulates between the trojans that close conjunctions cease . the `` unstirred '' phase , during which distant conjunctions occur and the distance between bodies is @xmath51 , lasts @xmath52 . afterwards , close conjunctions resume .",
    "we review the properties of neptune trojans requiring explanation . with only one trojan",
    "known , we infer many of these characteristics by combining direct observations with theory .      evaluated in a heliocentric , j2000 ecliptic - based coordinate system on julian date 2451545.0 , the osculating elements of qr are @xmath53 au , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 rad ( elliot et al .  2005 ) .",
    "uncertainties in these values are less than 10% ( @xmath56 ) and computed according to the procedure developed by bernstein & khushalani ( 2000 ) .",
    "the epicycles traced by qr are larger than the radial width of the tadpole ; @xmath57 .    the libration amplitude",
    ",    @xmath58    equals the full angular extent of the tadpole orbit , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mean orbital longitudes of the trojan and of the planet , respectively . for qr , @xmath61 ( c03 ) .",
    "an assumed albedo of 124% yields a radius for qr of @xmath62@xmath63 ( c03 ) .",
    "this size is comparable to that of the largest known jupiter trojan , ( 624 ) hektor , whose minimum and maximum semi - axis lengths are @xmath175 km and @xmath1150 km , respectively ( barucci et al .  2002 ) .",
    "we refer to trojans resembling qr as `` large . ''",
    "the distribution of des search fields on the sky , coupled with theoretical maps of the sky density of neptune trojans ( nesvorny & dones 2002 ) , indicate that @xmath6430 large objects ( resembling qr ) librate about neptune s l4 point ( c03 ) .",
    "if the true radius of qr is near our estimated lower bound , @xmath62 km , then the number of large neptune trojans is comparable to that of large jupiter trojans , of which there are @xmath110 whose radii exceed @xmath165 km",
    "( barucci et al .  2002 ) .",
    "if the true radius of qr is closer to our estimated upper bound , @xmath65 km , then large neptune trojans outnumber their jovian counterparts by a factor of @xmath11030 , since there is only 1 jupiter trojan ( hektor ) whose radius exceeds @xmath1100 km ( barucci et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "large neptune trojans observed today are essentially collisionless ; they are not the remains of a once greater population that has been reduced in number by collisions .",
    "we consider here catastrophic dispersal by collisions with bodies in the same trojan cloud . by catastrophic dispersal",
    "we mean that the mass of the largest post - collision fragment is no greater than half the mass of the original target and that collision fragments disperse without gravitational re - assembly .",
    "the lifetimes , @xmath66 , of large neptune trojans against catastrophic dispersal depend on their relative velocities , @xmath67 , at impact .",
    "if the orbit of qr is typical , then @xmath68 .",
    "at such impact velocities , catastrophically dispersing a target of radius @xmath69 and corresponding mass @xmath70 may be impossible .",
    "this is seen as follows .",
    "the gravitational binding energy of such a target well exceeds its chemical cohesive energy .",
    "then dispersal requires a projectile mass @xmath71 satisfying    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the radius of the combined mass @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the fraction of pre - collision translational kinetic energy converted to post - collision translational kinetic energy ( evaluated in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath71 and @xmath70 ) .",

    "since the maximum of the left - hand - side is only 0.17 , catastrophic dispersal can not occur at such low relative velocities .",
    "even if the inclination dispersion of neptune trojans were instead as large as @xmath10.5 rad  similar to that of jupiter trojans , and permitted by dynamical stability studies ( nesvorny & dones 2002)collisional lifetimes are probably too long to be significant . such a large inclination dispersion would imply that @xmath80 and that projectiles having radii @xmath81 could catastrophically disperse qr - sized objects [ by equation ( [ breakup2 ] ) ] .",
    "the number , @xmath82 , of such projectiles is unknown . if the size distribution of neptune trojans resembles that of jupiter trojans ( jewitt et al .",
    "2000 ) , then @xmath83 , which would imply    @xmath84    where we have taken trojan projectiles to occupy a volume of azimuthal arclength @xmath1@xmath85 , radial width @xmath1@xmath86 , and vertical height @xmath1@xmath87 , and inserted @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we conclude that the current number of qr - sized neptune trojans can not be explained by appealing to destructive intra - cloud collisions .",
    "that large neptune trojans have not suffered collisional attrition suggests that their number directly reflects the efficiency of a primordial formation mechanism .",
    "it seems unlikely that gravitational perturbations exerted by solar system planets in their current configuration reduced the neptune trojan population by orders of magnitude .",
    "nesvorny & dones ( 2002 ) perform the following experiment that suggests neptune trojans are generically stable in the present epoch .",
    "they synthesize a hypothetical population of 1000 neptune trojans by scaling the positions and velocities of actual jupiter trojans . over @xmath6 ,",
    "about 50% of their neptune trojans remain in resonance .",
    "objects survive even at high inclination , @xmath90 .      by contrast , during the era of planet formation , dramatic re - shaping of the planets orbits likely impacted the number of neptune trojans significantly . to pinpoint the time of birth of present - day trojans",
    ", we must understand the history of neptune s orbit .",
    "current conceptions of this history involve a phase when proto - neptune s orbit was strongly perturbed by neighboring protoplanets ( gls04 ; see also thommes et al .",
    "1999).20 au by accreting in the sub - hill regime ( gls04 ) .",
    "our conclusion that present - day neptune trojans formed after neptune s orbit finally circularized does not change if we follow instead the scenario in which the ice giant cores were formed between jupiter and saturn and were ejected outwards ( thommes et al .",
    "] once protoplanets grew to when their mass became comparable to the mass in remaining planetesimals , circularization of the protoplanets orbits by dynamical friction with planetesimals was rendered ineffective ( gls04 ; see also  [ insitu ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the protoplanets gravitationally scattered themselves onto orbits having eccentricities of order unity . at this time , the mass of an individual protoplanet equaled the isolation mass ,    @xmath91    which is the mass enclosed within each protoplanet s annular feeding zone of radial width @xmath1@xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a protoplanet s hill sphere radius , @xmath94 ( greenberg et al .",
    "1991 ) , and @xmath95 is an earth mass . for the surface density , @xmath96 , of the protoplanetary disk , we use @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the surface density of condensates in the minimum - mass solar nebula at a heliocentric distance of 30 au .",
    "the actual surface density might well have exceeded the minimum - mass value by a factor of @xmath13 , in which case @xmath99 .",
    "the phase of high eccentricity ended when enough protoplanets were ejected from the solar system that proto - neptune s orbit could once again be kept circular by dynamical friction with planetesimals .",
    "trojans present prior to neptune s high - eccentricity phase would likely have escaped the resonance due to perturbations by neighboring protoplanets .",
    "our numerical integrations show that while trojans can be hosted by highly eccentric planets , such trojans undergo fractional excursions in orbital radius as large as those of their hosts , i.e. , of order unity ( figure [ ecchost ] ) .",
    "since fractional separations between protoplanets would only have been of order @xmath100 , trojan orbits would have crossed those of nearby protoplanets .",
    "long - term occupancy of the resonance must wait until after protoplanet ejection and the final circularization of neptune s orbit .",
    "note that c03 argue that the existence of neptune trojans rules out violent orbital histories for neptune .",
    "we consider their case to be overstated .",
    "present - day neptune trojans can be reconciled with prior eccentricities of order unity for neptune s orbit , provided that trojan formation occurs after neptune s circularization by dynamical friction .      after neptune s orbit circularized , the planet may still have migrated radially outwards by scattering ambient planetesimals ( fernandez & ip 1984 ; hahn & malhotra 1999 ) .",
    "neptune trojans can escape during migration by passing through secondary resonances with uranus and the gas giants ( gomes 1998 ; kortenkamp , malhotra , & michtchenko  2003 ) . in our analysis",
    "below , we assume that trojans form after migration and therefore do not suffer such losses .",
    "trojans can , in principle , be captured via mass growth of the host planet .",
    "this mechanism , which we call `` pull - down capture , '' has been proposed to generate jupiter trojans as a massive gaseous envelope accreted onto the core of proto - jupiter ( marzari & scholl 1998ab ; fleming & hamilton 2000 ; marzari et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "pull - down capture may have played a supporting role in the capture of neptune trojans , but likely not a leading one .",
    "the mechanism operates on the principle of adiabatic invariance .",
    "if , as is likely , the mass of the planet grows on a timescale longer than @xmath17 , then the libration amplitudes of 1:1 resonators shrink as    @xmath101    horseshoe orbits  those in 1:1 resonance that loop around both triangular points , so that @xmath102can be converted to trojan orbits , having @xmath103 .",
    "these bounds derive from the circular , restricted , planar 3-body problem .",
    "one shortcoming of current treatments of pull - down capture is that the prior existence of horseshoe librators is assumed without explanation .",
    "horseshoe librators are more unstable than tadpole librators ; the former escape resonance more easily due to perturbations by neighboring planets.20 known asteroids that , sometime within 1000 years of the current epoch , occupy horseshoe - like orbits with jupiter . these objects transition often between resonant and non - resonant motion . ]",
    "what sets the number of these weakly bound resonators at the beginning of pull - down scenarios is unclear .    even if we ignore the problem of having to explain the origin of horseshoe librators , the efficacy of pull - down capture is weak [ equation ( [ weakling ] ) ] .",
    "the factor by which neptune increases its mass subsequent to its high - eccentricity phase is @xmath104 [ equation ( [ miso ] ) ] .",
    "such mass growth implies that pull - down capture , operating alone , produces trojans having only large libration amplitudes , @xmath105 .",
    "by contrast , the orbit of qr is characterized by @xmath61 .",
    "excessive libration amplitudes even afflict jupiter trojans formed by pull - down capture , despite the @xmath130-fold increase in jupiter s mass due to gas accretion ( marzari & scholl 1998b ) .",
    "collisions have been proposed to extend the distribution of libration amplitudes down to smaller values ( marzari & scholl 1998b ) , but our analysis in  [ pastpop ] indicates that large trojans are collisionless .",
    "moreover , inter - trojan collisions dissipate energy and therefore deplete the resonance ; see  [ intro ] and  [ insitu ] .    in sum",
    ", formation of large neptune trojans by pull - down capture seems unlikely because libration amplitudes are inadequately damped ; neptune increases its mass by too modest an amount after the planet s high - eccentricity phase .",
    "large , initially non - resonant objects of radius @xmath69 can be deposited directly into trojan resonance by collisions .",
    "successful deflection of target mass @xmath70 by projectile mass @xmath71 requires that the post - collision semi - major axis of @xmath70 lie within @xmath1@xmath106 of @xmath14 , and that the post - collision eccentricity be small ( resembling that of qr ) .",
    "we estimate the number of successful depositions into one trojan cloud as follows .",
    "first , we recognize that successful emplacement requires @xmath107 , since it is difficult for widely varying masses to significantly deflect each other s trajectory .",

    "we provide a more precise definition of success below .",
    "for the collision geometries that we experiment with , we find that @xmath121 ensures that all successful collisions are counted ( i.e. , @xmath120 goes to zero at the limits of integration ) .",
    "computing @xmath115 requires knowing how pre - collision semi - major axes , eccentricities , and inclinations are distributed . since these distributions in the early solar system are unknown , we attempt the more practicable goal of estimating the maximum value of @xmath115 by experimenting with simple cases . to better understand the ingredients for a successful emplacement , we allow @xmath122 .",
    "we model collisions as completely inelastic encounters between point particles , though we allow for the possibility of catastrophic dispersal .",

    "the existence of neptune trojans can be reconciled with violent orbital histories of neptune ( thommes et al .",
    "1999 ; gls04 ) , provided that trojans form after the planet has its orbit circularized . in histories where neptune s eccentricity was once of order unity , final circularization is achieved by dynamical friction with ambient planetesimals .",
    "long - term occupancy of the trojan resonance is possible after circularization .",
    "this point was not recognized by c03 .",
    "we regard their argument that present - day neptune trojans rule out dramatic scattering events for neptune to be overstated .",
    "pull - down capture , whereby objects are trapped into trojan resonance by mass growth of the host planet , is unlikely to have been solely responsible for the origin of large neptune trojans .",
    "libration amplitudes ( i.e. , tadpole orbit sizes ) are damped by pull - down capture too inefficiently to explain the libration amplitude of qr .",
    "moreover , the present theory is unsatisfactory because it assumes , without explanation , the prior existence of objects on 1:1 horseshoe orbits .",
    "the theory fails to specify what determines the number of weakly bound librators at the onset of pull - down capture .",
    "a pair of initially non - resonant , qr - sized objects can be diverted onto low - eccentricity trojan orbits ( like that occupied by qr ) when they collide near the periapse and apoapse of their respective orbits .",
    "the greatest efficiencies of direct collisional emplacement are attained for planetesimals that orbit 12 hill radii away from the planet and whose eccentricities are 12 @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176@xmath177 , where @xmath32 is the ratio of neptune s mass to the sun s .",
    "such orbits are strongly chaotic and can not be maintained over collision timescales .",
    "we estimate that actual efficiencies of direct emplacement are so low that a heliocentric disk of qr - like planetesimals can divert @xmath187 of its members into resonance only if the disk s surface density exceeds @xmath120% that of the local minimum - mass disk of solids .",
    "unfortunately , such a large surface density in qr - sized objects is not supported by observations of the kuiper belt or by theoretical models of how neptune and kuiper belt objects accreted .",
    "we therefore discount the formation of large neptune trojans by direct collisional emplacement .",
    "_ in situ _ accretion of large neptune trojans is viable and attractive .",
    "we exercised the two - groups approximation to study accretion dynamics within a primordial trojan sub - disk composed of small seed bodies having sizes @xmath295 and a surface density lower than that of the local minimum - mass disk of condensates by @xmath296 .",
    "this surface density is 10 times that of the neptune trojan sub - disk today ( in qr - sized objects ) .",
    "a plausible way to seed the resonance is by planetesimal collisions that insert ejecta fragments into the trojan libration region .",
    "big bodies accrete small bodies in our model sub - disk to grow to a radius of @xmath297 over a period of @xmath298 .",
    "their number at this time is @xmath299 , as mandated by the rules of dispersion - dominated oligarchy .",
    "collisional diffusion of small bodies out of the resonance naturally halts further growth .",
    "large neptune trojans may be the most recently assembled objects in our planetary system .",
    "we have developed the case that the number and sizes of large neptune trojans represent an unadulterated imprint of oligarchic accretion inside resonance .",
    "confirmation of this result would support theories of planet formation by accretion of very small particles ( gls04 ) .",
    "what future observations or theoretical work might help to develop this picture ?",
    "measurement and calculation of the size distribution of trojans are natural next steps .",
    "perhaps more intriguing is the question of velocity dispersions inside the neptune trojan cloud .    today , the eccentricity and inclination ( with respect to the invariable plane ) of qr are both about 0.03 .",
    "the corresponding epicyclic velocities are of order 200 m / s .",
    "in contrast , our accretion model requires velocity dispersions @xmath300 2 m / s while big bodies grow .",
    "we suspect , but have yet to check , that today s velocity dispersions are the result of gravitational perturbations exerted by the other giant planets  perturbations unchecked by dynamical friction during the present , non - accretionary epoch .",
    "we might expect planetary perturbations to amplify eccentricities and inclinations of neptune trojans to values not exceeding @xmath10.1 .",
    "this expectation stems from billion - year - long integrations of possible trajectories of qr ( brasser et al .",
    "2004 ) , which reveal that its eccentricity and inclination ( with respect to the invariable plane ) stay below @xmath10.1 .",
    "for some trajectories , the @xmath292 resonance is found to raise the inclination of qr to at most @xmath301 ( 0.12 rad ) .",
    "more typically , the inclination remains below @xmath1@xmath302 ( brasser et al .",
    "thus , even though neptune trojans can exist at inclinations as high as @xmath1@xmath303 ( nesvorny & dones 2002 ; marzari et al .",
    "2003 ) , we see no reason why these niches at high inclination should be occupied .",
    "we might expect mutual inclinations between large neptune trojans to be less than @xmath1@xmath304 .",
    "this picture of a `` thin disk '' contrasts with the `` thick disks '' of other minor body belts ",
    "jupiter trojans , main belt asteroids , and the kuiper belt4.6 degrees with respect to their mean plane ( elliot et al .",
    "2005 ) . like neptune trojans",
    ", this cold population may also be relatively dynamically pristine.]and reflects the dynamically cold accretionary environment that we have championed .",
