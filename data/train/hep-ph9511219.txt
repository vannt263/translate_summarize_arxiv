    "fermion number violating processes involving two particles in the initial state are generally believed to be also exponentially suppressed@xcite .",

    "unsuppressed fermion number violating processes are generally believed to have of order @xmath8 particles in both the initial and final states .",
    "this all suggests that fermion number violation will remain unobservable at future accelerators no matter how high the energy , whereas in the high temperature environment of the early universe such processes did play a significant role@xcite .    in this paper , we explore the robustness of these ideas by studying a variant of the standard model in which the amplitudes for certain fermion number violating collisions , as well as for spontaneous decays , can be reliably estimated for small coupling @xmath2 . the model is the standard electroweak theory with the higgs mass taken to infinity and with a skyrme term@xcite added to the higgs sector . with these modifications ,",

    "ordinary baryon and lepton number are violated in the decay .",
    "we shall see that the model has a limit in which fermion number violating amplitudes can be reliably estimated both for processes which occur by tunnelling and for those which occur in two particle collisions between a soliton and a single @xmath0-boson with energy above the barrier .      to modify the standard model",

    "the energy functional along this path has a maximum which is greater than the soliton mass . as we vary the path ,",

    ", the classically stable soliton can decay by barrier penetration @xcite .",

    ", we focus on processes where there is enough energy to go over the barrier . in the standard model ,",
    "the sphaleron mass is of order @xmath65 and the sphaleron size is of order @xmath66 .",
    "this means that for small @xmath2 two incident @xmath0 bosons each with energy half the sphaleron mass have wavelengths much shorter than the sphaleron size .",
    "this mismatch is the reason that over the barrier processes are generally believed to be exponentially suppressed in @xmath67 collisions .",
    "in contrast , in the model we consider we can take a soliton as one of the initial state particles . to the extent that the soliton is close to the sphaleron",
    "we have a head start in going over the barrier .",
    "we can also choose parameters such that an incident @xmath0 boson with enough energy to kick the soliton over the barrier has a wavelength comparable to both the soliton and sphaleron sizes .",
    "we first look at solutions to the minkowski space classical equations of motion derived from the lagrangian ( [ unitarylag ] ) . to simplify the calculations we work in the spatial spherical ansatz@xcite .",
    "we solve the equations numerically . as initial data",
    "we take a single electroweak soliton at rest with a spherical pulse of gauge field , localized at a radius much greater than the soliton size , moving inward toward the soliton . in the next section",
    ", we display one example of a soliton - destroying pulse in detail . for @xmath46 within about a factor of two of @xmath60 , for all the pulse profiles we have tried with the pulse width comparable to the soliton size , there is a threshold pulse energy above which the soliton is destroyed .",
    "the energy threshold is larger than the barrier height , and does depend on the pulse profile .",
    "however , the existence of a threshold energy above which the soliton is destroyed seems robust , and in this sense the choice of a particular pulse profile is not important .",
    "a classical wave narrowly peaked at frequency @xmath68 with total energy @xmath69 can be viewed as containing @xmath70 particles . making a mode decomposition",
    ", we can then estimate the number of gauge field quanta , that is @xmath0 bosons , in a pulse which destroys the electroweak soliton . from ( [ unitarylag ] )",
    "we see that such a pulse has an energy proportional to @xmath71 for fixed @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the particle number @xmath72 of any such pulse goes like some constant over @xmath73 .",
    "for example , at @xmath74 we have found pulses with @xmath75 . at this value of @xmath46 , by varying the pulse shape we could reduce @xmath76 somewhat but we doubt that we could make it arbitrarily small . upon reducing @xmath46 towards @xmath60 and thus lowering the energy barrier @xmath77 , smaller values of @xmath76 become possible .",
    "for example , at @xmath78 we have found pulses with @xmath79 . in the standard model , finding gauge boson pulses which traverse the sphaleron barrier and which have small @xmath76 appears to be much more challenging @xcite .",
    "note from the form of ( [ unitarylag ] ) that taking @xmath2 to zero with @xmath45 and @xmath46 fixed is the semi - classical limit . in this limit ,",
    "the soliton mass , the sphaleron mass and their difference @xmath77 all grow as @xmath71 .",
    "the number of particles in any classical pulse which destroys the soliton also grows as @xmath71 .",
    "the existence of soliton destroying classical pulses has quantum implications beyond a naive estimate of the number of particles associated with a classical wave . in appendix",
    "b we give a full and self - contained account of the relationship between classical solutions and the quantum tree approximation in a simple scalar theory . in a theory with an absolutely stable soliton , the hilbert space of the quantized theory separates into sectors with a fixed number of solitons , and states in different sectors have zero overlap@xcite .",
    "we argue in section iii using the results of appendix b that the existence of classical solutions in which solitons are destroyed demonstrates that there are states in the zero and one soliton sectors of the quantum theory whose overlap in the semi - classical limit is not exponentially small .",
    "these states are coherent states with mean number of @xmath0-bosons of order @xmath71 . knowing that some quantum processes exist which connect the zero and one soliton sectors suggests that we go beyond the semi - classical limit and",
    "look for such processes involving only a single incident @xmath0-boson .",
    "there is an interesting limit in which we can reliably estimate amplitudes for single particle induced decays .",
    "recall that for @xmath45 and @xmath2 fixed , as @xmath46 approaches @xmath60 from above the sphaleron mass approaches the soliton mass .",
    "we can hold @xmath45 fixed and pick @xmath46 to be a function of @xmath2 chosen so that as @xmath2 goes to zero @xmath46 approaches @xmath60 in such a way that @xmath80 remains fixed .",
    "we call this the fixed @xmath77 limit",
    ". it is different from the semi - classical limit in that as @xmath2 goes to zero the classical theory is changing .",
    "we will argue in section iv that for @xmath46 near @xmath60 it is possible to isolate a mode of oscillation about the soliton whose frequency is near zero , which is in the direction of the sphaleron .",
    "this normalizable mode , which we call the @xmath81-mode , is coupled to a continuum of modes with frequencies @xmath82 .",
    "if the @xmath81-mode is sufficiently excited by energy transferred from the continuum modes , then the soliton will decay .",
    "we are able to estimate the amplitude for a single @xmath0-boson of energy @xmath69 to excite the @xmath81-mode enough to induce the decay . at threshold",
    "the cross section goes like @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a dimensionless constant . in the same limit",
    "we can calculate the rate for the soliton to decay by tunnelling and we get @xmath85 .",
    "both are exponentially small as @xmath2 goes to zero and the ratio of the tunnelling rate to the induced decay rate is exponentially small .",
    "we introduce fermions into this theory as in the standard model .",
    "the left - handed components transform as @xmath5 doublets whereas the right - handed components are singlets .",
    "the fermion mass is generated in a gauge - invariant way by a yukawa coupling to the higgs field .",
    "for simplicity we only consider the case where both the up and down components of the fermion doublet have equal mass @xmath86 . in any process where a soliton is destroyed",
    "there is a violation of fermion number .",
    "the nature of this violation is different depending on whether the fermion is light , @xmath87 , or heavy , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the characteristic size of the soliton . in the light fermion case ,",
    "when the soliton disappears one net anti - fermion is produced in the process . in the heavy fermion case no fermions are produced .",
    "however in this case the soliton carries heavy fermion number and when the soliton is destroyed this quantum number is violated . in both cases there is a change of fermion number of minus one and heavy minus light fermion number is conserved as it must be since the heavy and light fermion number currents have the same anomalous divergence .",
    "the metastable electroweak soliton of the modified higgs sector is an intriguing object to study . yet",
    "this beast is not found in the standard electroweak theory where the higgs sector is a linear sigma model with no higher derivative terms .",
    "it is reasonable to ask if the modified theory gives a credible description of physics at the weak scale .",
    "to date the higgs boson has not been found . if it is found and the mass is low so that @xmath81 of ( [ smhiggslag ] ) is small then working in the infinite @xmath81 limit would not well approximate reality .",
    "however , if the higgs is heavy , then working with infinite @xmath81 could be justifiable .",
    "working at the scale @xmath22 and below , we then integrate out the heavy higgs , leaving a low energy effective action . in this strongly interacting case , higher derivative terms in the effective action",
    "would not be perturbatively small and we would expect all possible higher derivative terms consistent with the symmetries .",
    "this effective theory would or would not support stable solitons .",
    "if it did then our use of the skyrme term is justified as a simple way to write an effective action which supports solitons .",
    "it is possible that the higgs is not fundamental .",
    "rather the higgs sector may be an effective theory describing the massless degrees of freedom which arise as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking in some more fundamental theory .",
    "for example , this is the basis of technicolor theories in which the symmetry breaking is introduced via a scaled up version of qcd . in technicolor theories",
    "one finds technibaryons which can be described as electroweak solitons just as the baryons of qcd can be described as skyrmions . for now , regardless of whether the underlying theory is specifically a technicolor model , as long as we are consistent with symmetry considerations , we are free to choose the effective theory to conveniently describe the particles which interest us . thus ( [ skyrmelag ] ) is a simple way to describe three massless bosons ( which are eaten in the gauged version ( [ fulllag ] ) ) as well as a stable ( metastable in ( [ fulllag ] ) ) heavy particle .",
    "of course the effective theory includes higher derivative terms other than the skyrme term , so it is not the precise form of ( [ fulllag ] ) which we think is plausible , but rather the physical picture which it describes .",
    "it is worth asking what processes can sensibly be described using the effective theory .",
    "the effective theory is a derivative expansion in momenta over @xmath22 .",
    "consider the ( fermion number conserving ) production of soliton  anti - soliton pairs in @xmath67 collisions .",
    "these processes are beyond the regime of applicability of the effective theory because the incident particles have momenta which are greater than @xmath22 , and the underlying theory must therefore be invoked .",
    "( for example , in a technicolor theory the production process would be described as techniquark  anti - techniquark pair production followed by technihadronization . )",
    "the effective theory is , however , well - suited to describing soliton decay induced by a single @xmath0 boson with energy just above @xmath77 in the fixed @xmath77 limit . in this limit @xmath45 is held fixed while @xmath90 , and thus @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the incident @xmath0 momentum to the scale @xmath22 is going to zero , and a treatment using the effective theory is justified .",
    "we begin our investigations classically . we wish to find solutions to the minkowski space classical equations of motion derived from the lagrangian ( [ unitarylag ] ) which at early times have an electroweak soliton and an incident pulse and which at late times have outgoing waves",
    "only , the soliton having been destroyed . in this section ,",
    "we investigate solutions to the equations of motion numerically . in order to make the numerical problem tractable ,",
    "we work in the spatial spherical ansatz @xcite .    the unitary gauge lagrangian ( [ unitarylag ] ) yields the equations of motion    @xmath92 , a_\\mu\\right]= 0   \\label{unitary - eom}\\ ] ]    where @xmath93\\ . \\label{dfmunu}\\ ] ] in the unitary gauge lagrangian , the skyrme term , @xmath94 ^ 2 $ ] , is the same as the quartic term in @xmath95 .",

    "it forms a soliton , an outgoing pulse of energy @xmath210 is radiated , and the soliton of mass @xmath56 is left sitting at the origin .",

    "we learned that the configuration @xmath510 has fermion number one if @xmath88 and fermion number zero if @xmath87 . since @xmath505=1 $ ] this means that as we reduce @xmath86 from @xmath507 to @xmath536 one ( net ) level must cross zero from below .",
    "accordingly , for one or more values of @xmath86 , of order @xmath537 , the dirac hamiltonian ( [ fermham ] ) has a zero energy bound state in the skyrmion background and furthermore there is a nonzero value of @xmath86 below which there are no zero energy bound states . now consider interpolating from the skyrmion configuration at @xmath519 to the soliton configuration .",
    "define @xmath538 to be the largest value of @xmath86 such that for all @xmath539 the dirac hamiltonian ( [ fermham ] ) in the background @xmath540 does not have a zero energy bound state . from our understanding of the skyrmion background ,",
    "we know that @xmath541 is of order @xmath537 . by making @xmath46 arbitrarily large",

    "therefore , for large enough @xmath46 , throughout the interpolation from the skyrmion to the soliton @xmath538 remains nonzero .",
    "we now assume that this is in fact the case for all @xmath53 .",
    "we feel that this is a reasonable assumption since , as figure 2 shows , the soliton configuration is quite similar to the corresponding skyrmion configuration even for @xmath46 near @xmath60 . making this assumption , we conclude that for @xmath87 , as for @xmath88 , no levels cross zero during the interpolation between @xmath534 and @xmath535 .",
    "hence , no fermions ( light or heavy ) are produced during the interpolation between @xmath532 and @xmath522 .",

    "suppose we are only interested light fermion production .",
    "we can view the heavy fermion as a device introduced only for the purpose of making an argument . because we have not included the back reaction of the fermions , heavy or light , on the bosonic background , any conclusions we reach about the light fermion are in fact independent of whether there is or is not a heavy fermion in the theory .",
    "therefore , in any process in which a soliton is destroyed , one net anti - fermion from each light @xmath5 doublet is anomalously produced .",
    "we have described a theory which agrees with the standard electroweak model at presently accessible energies but which includes a metastable soliton with mass of order several tev .",
    "this higgs sector soliton may have a dual description as a bound state particle made of more fundamental constituents or it may be that the higgs sector is fundamental and when quantum effects are taken into account , a metastable soliton is found . in any event ,",
    "given the soliton , under certain circumstances we can reliably estimate the rate for collision induced decays .",
    "the parameters of the theory can be chosen so that the soliton configuration is close to the sphaleron configuration , which means that using the soliton as an initial particle makes it easy to find sphaleron crossing processes .",
    "indeed , we have found classical solutions in which the soliton is destroyed where the incoming pulse corresponds to a quantum coherent state with @xmath542 @xmath0-bosons .",
    "the rate for such processes is not exponentially suppressed as @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "furthermore in the limit @xmath2 goes to zero with @xmath543 fixed we can reliably estimate the rate for a two particle scattering process in which a single incident @xmath0-boson kicks the soliton over the barrier causing it to decay .",
    "we have argued that in all processes in which the soliton disappears fermion number is violated .",
    "this model may be relevant only as a theoretical foil , as a demonstration that fermion number violating high energy scattering processes can be very different than in the standard model .",

    "<S> we consider a variant of the standard electroweak theory in which the higgs sector has been modified so that there is a classically stable weak scale soliton . </S>",
    "<S> we explore fermion number violating processes which involve soliton decay . </S>",
    "<S> a soliton can decay by tunnelling under the sphaleron barrier , or the decay can be collision induced if the energy is sufficient for the barrier to be traversed . </S>",
    "<S> we present a classical solution to the minkowski space equations of motion in which a soliton is kicked over the barrier by an incoming pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this pulse corresponds to a quantum coherent state with mean number of @xmath0 quanta @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3 gauge coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a self - contained treatment of the relationship between classical solutions , including those in which solitons are destroyed , and tree - level quantum amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we consider a limit in which we can reliably estimate the amplitude for soliton decay induced by collision with a single @xmath0-boson . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude depends on @xmath2 like @xmath4 , and is larger than that for spontaneous decay via tunnelling in the same limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that in soliton decays , light @xmath5 doublet fermions are anomalously produced . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have a calculation of a two body process with energy above the sphaleron barrier in which fermion number is violated .    </S>",
