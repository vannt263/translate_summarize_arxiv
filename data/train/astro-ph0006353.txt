    "there has been a lot of recent controversy concerning the density profiles of the dark matter halos of virialized cosmological structures , from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scale .",
    "n - body simulations of the formation of `` virialized '' dark matter halos associated with galaxies and clusters in a cold dark matter model were found to be well - fit by a simple , universal form for the variation of mass density @xmath0 with radial distance @xmath1 from the center of mass , given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some characteristic radius which separates the two asymptotic power - law slopes , @xmath4 at @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a characteristic density which reflects the mean density of the universe at the epoch of halo formation ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; `` nfw '' ) .",
    "more recent n - body simulations of higher resolution obtain halo profiles which agree with the nfw profile at large radii but have an even steeper inner slope , @xmath9 ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this prediction by the standard cdm model of singular density profiles for cosmological halos is apparently in conflict with the observed mass distributions inside dark - matter - dominated halos on two extremes of the halo mass function , dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters . as a result",
    ", these observations and their interpretation have recently come under intense scrutiny . in work going back to flores & primack ( 1994 ) , moore ( 1994 ) , burkert ( 1995 ) and more recently in kravtsov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and mcgaugh & de blok ( 1999 ) , these predictions of singular halos were found to be in conflict with the halo density profiles derived from the observed rotation curves of dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies .",
    "the latter were found , instead , to be better fit by density profiles with flat cores .",
    "recently , the universality of this observational requirement that dark - matter - dominated galactic halos possess a uniform - density core has been challenged on the grounds that the rotation curves are not generally resolved well enough in the centers to distinguish the slowly rising rotation curve which results from a mass profile with a flat core from the more rapid rise which results from a cuspy profile @xcite .",
    "initially , this challenge appeared to apply primarily to lsb galaxies , leaving the case for uniform - density cores in dwarf galaxies still strong .",
    "for example , the well - resolved rotation curves of the nearby dwarf galaxies ddo 154 and ngc 3109 still demanded a flat density core @xcite .",
    "very recently , however , this challenge has been extended to the interpretation of dwarf galaxy rotation curves , as well ( van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) . while the latter are still generally better fit by halo profiles with a flat core , it can no longer be stated with much confidence that the observations _ demand _ such profiles .",
    "until better resolution data become available , profiles with @xmath10 near the center , with @xmath11 , all seem to yield reasonable fits to the data .",
    "hence , while it appears that a significant conflict remains between the cdm halos predicted by the highest resolution n - body simulations to date ( which imply @xmath9 at the center ) and the dwarf galaxy rotation curves , the current observations are unable to discriminate effectively between halos with inner profiles as cuspy as the nfw profile and those with a uniform - density core , instead .    on the galaxy cluster scale , the case for a uniform - density core has been made most convincingly using observations of strong gravitational lensing , where the images of background galaxies are distorted by the cluster mass to form arcs and multiple images . to date , the most spectacular example of such observation is a hubble space telescope image of multiple arcs produced by the cluster cl  0024 + 1654 at @xmath12 .",
    "the relaxed structure of cl  0024 + 1654 , the absence of a single , central , dominant cluster galaxy , and the presence of an easily - identified multiply - imaged background galaxy make this cluster a particularly good candidate for a determination of the halo mass profile from lensing analysis .",
    "according to tyson , kochanski , & dellantonio ( 1998 ) , the observations of this cluster require a halo mass profile with a uniform - density core , in strong conflict with the predicted cuspy profile of nfw .",
    "these conflicts between the cdm n - body results and the observations of dwarf galaxy and cluster halo profiles have stimulated a vigorous re - examination of the theoretical underpinnings of the cdm model , including a number of suggestions for a variation of the microscopic properties of cdm which might serve to produce halos with uniform - density cores while retaining the more successful aspects of the original cdm model .",
    "these include suggestions that the dark matter is nongravitationally self - interacting @xcite , warm ( e.g. sommer - larsen & dolgov 2000 ; coln , avila - reese , & valenzuela 2000 ; hannestad & scherrer 2000 ) , fluid @xcite , decaying @xcite , repulsive @xcite , fuzzy @xcite , and annihilating @xcite . in view of the importance of the dwarf galaxy and cluster halo profile observations in constraining the theoretical models , it is somewhat disappointing that the conclusions based upon dwarf galaxy rotation curves are currently so ambiguous with regard to the question of the uniform - density core",
    ". this makes the conclusion of tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) regarding the core in cl  0024 + 1654 all the more critical .",
    "recently , a new study of this cluster by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) has reached a conclusion opposite to that of tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) regarding the consistency of the observed mass profile with the density profiles predicted by the n - body simulations of cluster formation in the standard cdm model .",
    "they find that the nfw mass profile is consistent with the lensing data .",
    "if this is correct , then the case against the standard cdm model is significantly weakened .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to point out that the fit by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of the cluster lensing data with a mass distribution which follows the nfw profile implies a cluster velocity dispersion which is much larger then the value measured for this cluster by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) of @xmath13 .",
    "the projected dark matter density profile which tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found by modeling the lensing data for cl  0024 + 1654 within the arcs at radius @xmath14 is well fit by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath21 .",
    "additionally , tyson et al . (",
    "1998 ) rule out at a great confidence level the possibility of a good fit of the observed mass distribution by the nfw profile .    a recent paper by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained , instead , a good fit to the lensing data with a total mass distribution given by the nfw profile in equation  ( [ nfw ] ) , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , the critical density of the universe at the cluster redshift .",
    "this @xmath26 is directly related to the nfw concentration parameter @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radius within which the average density is 200 times this critical density , according to @xmath29}},\\ ] ] which yields @xmath30 , and @xmath31mpc . from this",
    "they concluded that there is no conflict between the observations of this cluster and the predictions of the standard cdm model .",
    "these mass profiles inferred for the cluster cl  0024 + 1654 based upon lensing observations have implications for the velocity dispersion of its dark matter and galaxies if the cluster is assumed to be in virial equilibrium .",
    "we begin by considering the nfw profile .",
    "the same n - body simulations of cluster formation in the cdm universe which indicate that clusters are , indeed , in an approximate virial equilibrium which can be described by the universal mass profile suggested by nfw also yield information about the 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath32 and its radial dependence . over a wide range of radii ,",
    "the halos obtained in n - body simulations are roughly isothermal ( tormen , bouchet , & white 1997 ; eke , navarro , & frenk 1998 ) . for comparison with the velocity dispersion of a cluster like cl  0024 + 1654 observed within some radius , it is necessary to consider the average velocity dispersion of the nfw halo within a sphere of the same radius . the average velocity dispersion of cl  0024 + 1654 was measured by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to be @xmath33 within a radius @xmath34 , based upon 107 galaxy redshifts , to an uncertainty of roughly less than @xmath35 .",
    "for the nfw profile proposed by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for this cluster , this radius corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "it is a relatively simple matter to estimate the predicted velocity dispersion @xmath37 for a given nfw density profile in terms of the circular velocity profile @xmath38 of the same halo , as follows .",
    "the circular velocity profile of the nfw halo is given by @xmath39}{x}},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the mass enclosed by radius @xmath1 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath38 is @xmath42 , which occurs at @xmath43 . the nfw velocity profile for the parameters reported by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is shown in figure  1 .",
    "we obtain @xmath44 for this cluster . according to the detailed analysis of numerical n - body results by tormen , bouchet , & white ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the average 1-d velocity dispersion within @xmath45 for simulated clusters , which are well - fit by the nfw profile , is somewhat lower than @xmath46 , but never by more than a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "this factor of 1.5 agrees very well with the aperture - averaged , line - of - sight @xmath32 which results from solving the jeans equation for the variation of the radial @xmath48 with @xmath1 inside the nfw profile , including the possible effects of anisotropic velocities ( lokas & mamon 2000 ; lokas , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , the nfw profile proposed for cl  0024 + 1654 by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) implies an average velocity dispersion for the cluster within the radius @xmath34 of @xmath49 , which is too large by a factor of @xmath50 to be compatible with the measured velocity dispersion quoted above . , the value if @xmath51 is for an einstein - de  sitter universe .",
    "our conclusion that @xmath52 substantially exceeds the observed @xmath53 remains unchanged if , instead , we consider other background cosmologies .",
    "the values of @xmath46 and @xmath37 for a low - density universe ( @xmath54 ) are only slightly lower than the values quoted above , by 10% for the open case ( @xmath55 ) and by 25% for the flat ( @xmath56 ) case . ]",
    "the tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mass model in equation  ( [ lens_fit ] ) does not uniquely predict the velocity dispersion @xmath32 implied for the cluster even if it is assumed to be in virial equilibrium . for one ,",
    "it is a fit _ only _ to the projected density within the arcs at @xmath57 and , therefore , does not constrain the external mass profile very well . for another , even if we restrict our attention to radii within the arcs and assume virial equilibrium , this is still not enough to specify @xmath32 and its radial dependence there uniquely . as a result ,",
    "it is not possible to compare the predicted @xmath32 for the tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mass model with the observed @xmath32 as directly as we did for the nfw profile above .",
    "however , we can at least demonstrate that the mass model is plausibly consistent with the observed @xmath32 , as follows .",
    "the projected mass density in equation  ( [ lens_fit ] ) is well fit by that obtained from the truncated , nonsingular , isothermal sphere ( `` tis '' ) profile of shapiro , iliev , & raga ( 1999 ) .",
    "we discuss the details of the fitting procedure and the results elsewhere ( iliev & shapiro 2000a , b ) .",
    "this tis represents a particular solution of the lane - emden equation which corresponds to the outcome of the collapse and virialization of a top - hat density perturbation .",
    "the size and virial temperature which result are unique functions of the mass and redshift of formation of the object for a given background universe . according to this solution ,",
    "the central density @xmath58 is roughly more than 500 times the density at the surface , and the core radius @xmath59 is about 1/30 of the total size .",
    "[ note : our definition of the core radius is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the `` king radius '' defined in binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) , p. 228 . ] as described elsewhere , this solution is a convenient analytical approximation for the halos which form from more realistic initial conditions in the cdm model , which reproduces many of the average structural properties of the halos found in cdm simulations , except in the very inner profile where the tis model has a uniform - density core instead of a central cusp . as such ,",
    "a fit of the tis profile to the tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mass model provides a plausible , physically - motivated connection between this mass model with a flat density core and the implied cluster velocity dispersion . the projected density profile of a tis sphere with a central density @xmath62 and",
    "a core radius @xmath63kpc provides a very close match to the tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) result for @xmath64 discussed above .",
    "based on this best - fit tis , the velocity dispersion is @xmath65 in close agreement with the measured value .",
    "two different attempts to invert the observations of strong lensing by cluster cl  0024 + 1654 to solve for the mass profile of the cluster have reached opposite conclusions regarding the presence of a uniform - density core versus the acceptability of a central cusp like that of the nfw profile .",
    "this suggests that , either there is some error in one or both of these analyses or else there is some degeneracy in the inversion process which prevents a clean discrimination between these different solutions .",
    "while we do not claim to address the accuracy of either of the two analyses of this cluster , we point out , instead , that there may be additional constraints on the allowed mass models which can aid in distinguishing them . in particular , the measured cluster velocity dispersion , which also reflects the mass distribution of the cluster , should also be required to be consistent with the mass model derived from the inversion of the lensing data .",
    "we have shown that this is not the case for the cuspy nfw profile which broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report is a good fit to the lensing data .",
    "that profile , if it actually corresponds to a halo formed in the standard cdm model , predicts much too high an average velocity dispersion to be consistent with the observed value .",
    "by contrast , the mass model of tyson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) does not have this problem .",
    "this suggests that the lensing data for cl  0024 + 1654 still favor a flattening of the density profile at small radii , in conflict with the prediction of cuspy halos by n - body simulations of the standard cdm model .    in view of the importance of this conclusion for the ongoing debate regarding the validity of the standard cdm model",
    ", it would be valuable if uncertainties in the gravitational lense models , such as that due to possible departures from spherical symmetry or substructure , were properly quantified .",
    "this uncertainty would have to be rather extreme , however , to reconcile the broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) profile fit with the observed velocity dispersion of cl  0024 + 1654 .",
    "the lensing analysis leads to nfw parameters roughly by measuring the mass interior to the arcs , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath41 , and determining @xmath3 by matching the logarithmic slope @xmath68 of the density profile at @xmath69 as derived from the projected mass distribution , according to @xmath70 . in order to adjust @xmath46 downward relative to the value discussed above by a factor large enough to reconcile the nfw profile with the observed velocity dispersion while leaving the measured mass @xmath71 unchanged ,",
    "therefore , @xmath3 must be reduced by factor of order 4 , to @xmath72 .",
    "this requires an observational uncertainty so large as to change the value @xmath73 reported by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) into @xmath74 , which seems very unlikely .",
