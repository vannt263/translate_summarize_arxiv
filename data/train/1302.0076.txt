    "diffuse hot gas is an important , yet probably the least understood component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in and around the milky way ( e.g. , wang 2010 ; putman et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "the hot ism has been proposed to account for much of the missing baryon matter within the galactic halo and traces energetic feedback from stars , which shapes the ecosystem of the galaxy .",
    "however , little is actually known observationally about the kinematic , chemical and spatial properties , as well as the content of the hot ism .",
    "it has been chiefly studied in its emission , which carries little distance information and is subject to absorption by cool gas  an effect that is often difficult to quantify . in the past several years , however , it has been demonstrated that the hot ism can be effectively characterized through x - ray absorption line spectroscopy ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2005 ; williams et al .  2005 ;",
    "yao & wang 2005 ; juett et al . 2006 ; costantini et al .   2012 ; wang 2010 and references therein ) . through the measurements of absorption lines produced by various ions in the spectra of bright x - ray sources , primarily active galactic nuclei and x - ray binaries , it becomes possible to constrain the spatial , physical , chemical , and kinematic properties of the hot gas .",
    "one key step in such a study is the identification and correction for any potential spurious features , which may be intrinsic to the background source or to the instruments .",
    "this issue is particularly acute for local sources , which may produce features that can not be easily recognized because of little systematic velocity offset .",
    "the existing interstellar x - ray absorption line study of cyg x-2 represents such an outstanding case ( yao et al .",
    "this archetypal z - source is a bright binary system containing a neutron star , accreting from its low - mass companion ( v1341 ) with an orbital period of 9.84450 days ( casares et al .",
    "2009 ) . in their study with a _",
    "chandra _ grating spectrum , yao et al .",
    "( 2009 ) particularly noted a puzzling lack of the interstellar  k@xmath0 ( 21.602   ) absorption line .",
    "other important oxygen absorption lines , such as  k@xmath1 ( 18.654   ) ,  k@xmath0 ( 18.967   ) and  k@xmath0 ( 22.040   ) , were all detected .",
    "the missing line is known to lay in the middle of these other lines in terms of the transition wavelengths and ionization states of the ions and is usually known to be the strongest of them all .",
    "one possibility presented , but ruled out , by yao et al . was that the absorption line might be filled or contaminated by a broad emission line similar to those detected at wavelengths shorter than 10     in the same spectrum ( schulz et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these broad emission lines originate from the photo - ionized accretion disk corona ( adc ) surrounding the neutron star .",
    "the presence of a broad  k@xmath0 emission line , which could only be partly absorbed , would leave broad wings in the spectrum , which were not detected .    in the present work",
    ", we test a hypothesis that the absorption line could be contaminated by a relatively narrow emission line .",
    "such a line or lines might be expected from x - ray heating of the atmosphere of the companion star and/or an outer region of the expected accretion disk , where the doppler broadening may be sufficiently small .",
    "this is possible because the  k@xmath0 line is at a lower energy than where the broad emission lines were detected . at such lower energies , relatively narrow emission lines",
    "were indeed observed in the spectra of lmc x-3 ( song et al .",
    "2010 ) , for example , although it is a high - mass x - ray binary with an accreting black hole .",
    "if this was the case , cyg x-2 may then be a problematic background source for the study of interstellar absorption lines .",
    "a varying , narrow emission line could not only make absorption lines vanish , but change their depths and other properties key to such a study . in the present work , we mainly use multiple _ xmm - newton _ observations to test our hypothesis and to potentially enhance our understanding of the hot ism along the line of sight as well as this well - known source itself .    indeed , vrtilek et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have suggested that  and  emission lines , as detected with _ hst_/ghrs observations of cyg x-2 , seem to arise from the surface of the companion .",
    "these lines show velocity shifts that are consistent with this interpretation ; but the fwhms of the lines are larger than expected",
    ". it may be possible that the line emission is from an accretion heated corona above the disk ; however , the fwhms are smaller than expected by simple models of line emission from accretion disks ; the lines also do not exhibit the double - peaked structure as predicted .",
    "we use recently available _ _ hst__/cos data of cyg x-2 with improved sensitivity and resolution to search for the  counterpart of the putative  line and to determine the nature of the line emission .",
    "in addition , we have carefully re - examined the /hetg data to check the consistency of the  results and to further the test of our scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in   2 , we describe the _ xmm - newton _ observations and our data reduction procedure .",
    "we present the analysis and results of the data in   3 .",
    "the results are then compared with those from other x - ray and uv data analyses in   4 . in   5 , we discuss the origins of the absorption and emission seen in the cyg x-2 , as well as the consistency of our scenario .",

    "_ hst _ visited cyg x-2 three times with the cos ( table  [ t : cos ] ) .",
    "these observations were taken with the fp_pos position shifting from 1 to 4 during each visit .",
    "we calibrated the observations with the pipeline calcos ( version 2.11f ) .",
    "flat - fielding and alignment of the processed exposures were carried out using idl routines developed by the cos science teamdanforth / costools.html for the co - adding and flat - fielding algorithm and additional discussion . ] .",
    "the extracted spectra from individual exposures of each observation were cross - correlated and combined to form an exposure - weighted co - added spectrum .    here",
    "we focus on the  doublet region of the cos spectra ( fig .",
    "[ f : cos ] ) .",
    "compared to the rest - frame wavelengths of 1238.82   and 1242.81  , the line centroids are blue - shifted , consistent with similar velocities as seen in the ghrs spectra ( vrtilek et al",
    ".  2003 ) .",
    "the profile of each line apparently consists of two major components : one ( with higher peak fluxes ) seems to be considerably narrower than the other . while a quantitative decomposition and modeling of these components are beyond the scope of the present work , a few trends are readily noticeable .",
    "both the centroid and flux of these two components change systematically with the phase .",
    "the positive centroid velocity shift of the narrow component , as seen from the left to the right panels , is qualitatively consistent with its association with the companion , as tentatively suggested by vrtilek et al .",
    "the component appears substantially narrower than inferred from the ghrs spectrum ( fwhms @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and is again more consistent with the companion origin than with the accretion disk .",
    "the velocity shift of the broad component with the phase appears to be in the opposite direction of the narrow one .",
    "therefore , the broad component can be attributed naturally to the accretion disk .",
    "both components appear to be the brightest in the @xmath7 plot .",
    "this trend for the broad component may be consistent with the saddle shaped disk model , in which less obscuration is expected at @xmath8 or 0.75 . for the narrow component , some obscuration may be expected from the companion itself , particularly at @xmath9 . with an inclination of 62.5@xmath10 for the binary system ( casares et al . 2009 )",
    ", the line emission may originate in an outflow from the heated surface of the companion .",
    "we further explore the potential connection of the line absorption with the broad - band x - ray fluxes of cyg x-2 . in fig .",
    "[ f : w_rxteflux ] , for example , we have marked all the grating observations on the light curve obtained with the  /asm .",
    "however , we find no apparent correlation of the absorption line ews seen in the rgs or hetg observations with the asm or rgs broad - band fluxes ( tables  [ t : xmm ] and  [ t : chandra ] ) .",
    "what is the origin of the  and  absorption lines ? along the line of sight toward cyg x-2 ( galactic coordinates @xmath11 ) , a typical ism absorber is expected to have a systemic velocity in the range of @xmath12 to @xmath13 , as seen in 21 cm neutral hydrogen surveys .",
    "in contrast , the systematic velocity of cyg x-2 is known to be @xmath14 ( casares et al .",
    "2009 ) , which means that its emission at the systemic velocity would be @xmath1515 m  off from the absorption line centroid ; the line - of - sight orbital velocity of the companion , @xmath16 , alone can hardly make a difference .",
    "the measured centroid of the  line , @xmath17  , appears to be slightly redshifted , compared to the expected rest - frame wavelength of 21.602  .",
    "but the measured line centroid of the  line , @xmath18  , compared to the expected 22.040  , shows an opposite shift .",
    "one also needs to consider the systematic absolute wavelength uncertainty of 7  m  ( 1@xmath3 ) , as is expected for an rgs observation .",
    "we add the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature and find that the centroids of both lines are consistent with an ism origin ( within @xmath19 ) and that the  line is significantly redshifted from the systemic velocity of cyg x-2 at a confidence level of @xmath20 .",
    "if the absorption lines arise from the hot ism , then the observed variation in the ews must be related to the changing intensity of the emission lines associated with cyg x-2 .",
    "because of the limited spectral resolution of the rgs ( fwhm @xmath21 60 m ) , the emission and absorption lines should be blended . but a velocity offset between the line emission and absorption could also be large enough to affect the centroid measurement of the absorption line .",
    "however , as mentioned in   3 , the current measurements are not sufficiently reliable to constrain the emission properties of the source .",
    "another interesting issue that needs an explanation is the fact that the  k@xmath1 absorption line was detected , while the  line was missing in the same /hetg spectrum ( yao et al .",
    "this may be understood in our emission filling scenario because the emissivity of the k@xmath0 transition is substantially higher than that of the k@xmath1 transition for a plasma of @xmath22 k. in addition , the effectiveness of the emission filling can be affected by the substantial difference in the absorption saturations of the two lines .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath23 at the center of the k@xmath0 line and @xmath24 for the k@xmath1 line for an absorbing plasma of a column density , log[n ( ) ] @xmath25 , and a velocity dispersion , @xmath26 ( yao et al .",
    "in contrast , there is no saturation for the corresponding emission lines .",
    "thus it is easier to fill a highly saturated  line than a weakly saturated  k@xmath1 line .    what is the origin of the emission lines ?",
    "possible sites are the accretion disk , the impact bulge of the accretion stream , and the surface or even outflow of the stellar companion .",
    "emission lines from the first two sites should generally be broad ( as observed in those short wavelength lines ; schulz et al .  2009 ) , due primarily to the fast rotation around the neutron star , depending on the exact location of the emission site . in comparison",
    ", the emission from the companion should be relatively narrow .",
    "therefore , the and  lines , as well as the narrow component of the  doublet seen in the cos spectra , are likely to be associated with the companion or its wind .",
    "also the relative strengths of these emission lines are sensitive to the temperature of x - ray - emitting plasma .",
    "therefore , the lines may not arise from the same locations .",
    "so a correlation between the line emissions is not necessary , which may explain the lack of the coincidence of the missing  and  absorption lines (   3 ) .",
    "indeed , the redshift of the emission line centroid wavelength corresponds to a velocity shift of @xmath27 , relative to the rest - frame wavelength ( 22.0403  ) and larger to the blue - shifted cyg x-2 . this large velocity shift , if real , indicates an association of the emission line with the accretion flow .",
    "however , this scenario can hardly explain the narrowness of the line .",
    "the emission and absorption lines together resembles a p - cygni profile , which could originate in a thick wind .",
    "however , the cyg x-2 has a low - mass companion , which is not expected to have a strong wind . also for a wind - generated p - cygni profile",
    ", the absorption is expected to be strong blue - shifted , while the emission should peak at the rest - frame wavelength , which is opposite to what is observed for cyg x-2 .",
    "so the origin of the emission line remains largely unknown .",
    "the  or  grating observations were taken in various different orbital cycles , in which cyg x-2 may be in very different states .",
    "therefore , the observations probably sampled quite different accretion , heating , and radiation processes ; hence different x - ray line emissions , even if the binary had similar orbital phases and/or continuum x - ray fluxes ( bauciska - church et al .",
    "2011 ; vrtilek et al .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to have a set of dedicated x - ray spectroscopic observations in a single orbital cycle . as illustrated in   3 , potential instrumental effects on the measurements of the absorption lines should also not be neglected .",
    "in addition to the discussed effect on the centroid measurement , the presence of instrumental features , which may not be corrected accurately , could , in principle , affect the quantitative measurements of the ew of a line as well .",
    "the pointing direction of the observations should thus be set carefully to minimize the presence of the instrumental features in the immediate vicinities of the key absorption lines .",
    "motivated by solving the mystery of the missing  absorption in a previous /hetg study , we have systematically analyzed 10 /rgs observations of cyg x-2 in the wavelength range covering both the  and  lines .",
    "this analysis is complemented by both a re - examination of the /hetg data and an analysis of the  1238.82    and 1242.81    doublet in three /cos spectra .",
    "the main results and conclusions that we have obtained are as follows :    * we have clearly detected the  absorption line in the bulk of the rgs observations .",
    "the mean ew of the line is @xmath28 m .",
    "but in one of the observations , the lack of the line ( or an inconsistency with the mean ew at the @xmath2 level ) is also detected , similar to the absence of the line in the /hetg spectra , which is confirmed in our re - analysis .",
    "similar ew variation is also detected for the  line .",
    "but this variation is not correlated with that of the  line . *",
    "the mean centroids of the two absorption lines are consistent with their origin in the ism .",
    "the ew variations in the lines are thus likely caused by changing contamination of the corresponding narrow line emission within the lrf of the rgs . * a re - examination of the meg spectrum shows an apparent narrow emission line right on the longer wavelength edge of the  absorption line .",
    "their ews are also comparable .",
    "therefore , such an emission , when observed with a lower spectral resolution and/or shifted to a shorter wavelength , could be responsible for the occasional disappearance of the  absorption in the rgs spectra .",
    "* a narrow component of the  emission doublet is also seen in the /cos spectra of cyg x-2 .",
    "this component , likely associated with the x - ray heated binary companion , varies in the line strengths and centroids . * the exact origin of the putative  and  line emission is yet to be understood",
    ". a dedicated monitoring study of the x - ray line absorption over a single orbital period could be particularly useful to constraining the site of the line emission and hence understanding its nature .",
