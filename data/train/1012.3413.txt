    "in pursuit of atomic - scale magnetic storage devices and future spintronics applications , one - dimensional ( 1d ) transition - metal ( tm ) nanostructures have become a topic of intense research interest.@xcite a promising route for future applications concerns e.g.  the control of the spin state in 1d wires using spin - polarized currents via the spin transfer torque . besides the strong technological motivation , from the fundamental point of view",
    "one - dimensional systems constitute a unique playground for electronic structure theory . due to",
    "enhanced intra - atomic exchange and lowered coordination , they reveal an increased tendency towards magnetism . for example , elements such as pt and pd , which are non - magnetic in bulk , can become magnetic in atomic chains.@xcite moreover , giant values of the magnetic anisotropy energy , which is crucial to stabilize magnetism against thermal fluctuations , have been found for free - standing , suspended , and deposited tm chains.@xcite owing to the rich physics in one - dimensional systems many more novel effects and phenomena have been reported in the recent years concerning their electronic structure , spin dynamics and transport properties .",
    "@xcite    the creation of monatomic chains in experiment is extremely challenging , however , in the most recent years , a few techniques to achieve this goal have been successfully developed .",
    "one experimental approach is the formation of chains in so - called mechanically controllable break junctions . upon pulling two electrodes apart ,",
    "it is possible to produce short freestanding monatomic chains suspended between the electrodes . with this technique ,",
    "successful chain formation has been reported for late @xmath1- and @xmath2-transition - metal elements and transport measurements can be performed to probe the junction properties .",
    "@xcite another route is to use a substrate and grow the chains by self - assembly exploiting one - dimensional structures provided by the surface topography such as step edges@xcite or in trenches of reconstructed surfaces as has been demonstrated for fe chains on ir(001)@xcite or au chains on si(111).@xcite a second possibility on a surface is to build the chain atom by atom utilizing a manipulation technique with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "the use of stm is particularly attractive as it also allows for a direct study of the magnetic properties of individual chains .",
    "e.g.  in combination with spin - polarized stm , serrate _",
    "_ used this approach to demonstrate non - collinear spin alignment in small linear chains of co atoms on mn / w(110).@xcite on the other hand , hirjibehedin and co - workers created linear mn chains of up to ten atoms on an insulating cun / cu(001 ) surface and applied inelastic stm to prove their antiferromagnetic exchange coupling.@xcite    one of the basic issues in chain magnetism is the sign , origin , and dependence on various external parameters of the exchange interaction between the tm atoms .",
    "the most common way to model a magnetic chain of atoms is the effective heisenberg hamiltonian : @xmath3 which describes the magnetic ground state and low - energy magnetic excitations of a system from the knowledge of the heisenberg parameters , or exchange constants , @xmath4 . in the latter relation @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are the unit vectors of the spins of atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e.  their magnitude does not depend on their relative orientation within this model . in case of linear equidistant monatomic chains of atoms of the same kind , the heisenberg model can be rewritten with respect to the atom at the origin with the heisenberg constants @xmath9 .",
    "the general solution of the heisenberg model on a periodic lattice , here a 1d monatomic chain , is the so - called ( flat ) spin - spiral state , which is a non - collinear arrangement of spins given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spacing between atoms in the chain and @xmath12 is the modulus of the spin - spiral vector . for each set of exchange parameters , the energy dispersion @xmath13 of a spin - spiral with a wave - vector @xmath12 , propagating along the chain axis @xmath14 , can be determined from eq .",
    "( 1 ) : @xmath15 and the ground state of the system can be found among collinear ferromagnetic ( fm , @xmath16 ) , collinear antiferromagnetic ( afm , @xmath17 ) , and non - collinear spin - spiral states .",
    "the phase diagram for the 1d - heisenberg model and characteristic shapes of the curves @xmath13 are presented in fig .  1 , where the exchange interaction was assumed to vanish beyond third nearest neighbor .",
    "as can be seen from fig .  1 , the phase space of possible ground states of a 1d spin chain is rather complicated and depends sensitively on the exchange parameters , exhibiting wide regions of preferred non - collinear solutions . as far as real tm chains are concerned , establishing their magnetic ground state position in the phase diagram of fig",
    ".  1 based on their electronic structure determined by _ ab initio _ calculations is a non - trivial task . while the exchange interactions have been explored intensively for finite tm magnetic clusters , both freestanding and deposited on surfaces,@xcite the work for infinite monatomic tm chains concentrated almost exclusively on collinear magnetic solutions.@xcite the occurrence of non - collinear magnetic states and analysis of exchange interaction beyond the first neighbor in freestanding and deposited monatomic chains has come into the focus of interest only recently,@xcite while a conclusive evidence for a spin - spiral ground state , or more complicated spin textures , in a real deposited metallic tm monatomic chain or wire with complex atomic relaxations is missing from _ ab initio _ theory .",
    "experimentally , it is very challenging to measure the exchange interaction .",
    "nevertheless , the sign of the exchange interaction has been indirectly determined by stm for mn , fe , and co dimers on nial(110)@xcite and even quantitatively for the interaction between single co atoms on pt(111 ) @xcite and for mn chains on cun / cu(001 ) .",
    "@xcite in the two latter cases , indirect exchange by the rkky interaction and super exchange via the substrate atoms , respectively , were concluded as the microscopic mechanisms .",
    "surprisingly , for the mn dimer on nial(110 ) ferromagnetic coupling due to double exchange was reported .",
    "@xcite         among other @xmath0-tms , mn chains are most likely to display a manifold of magnetic solutions depending on the details of chain geometry , environment and hybridization with the substrate .",
    "this stems from the fact that a monowire ( mw ) of mn atoms experiences a fm to afm ground state transition as a function of the interatomic distance @xmath11 not far away from the equilibrium value @xmath18.@xcite the origin of this transition lies in the subtle competition of antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange and ferromagnetic double exchange,@xcite which in terms of the @xmath11-electron exchange splitting @xmath19 and hopping @xmath20 can be quantitatively described as a competition between the @xmath21 and @xmath20 terms , respectively.@xcite the kinetic exchange arises from a level repulsion between occupied majority states of an atom with unoccupied minority states of a neighboring atom , when the spins of the two atoms are opposite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hopping between the @xmath11-states of the neighboring atoms gives rise to an energy gain due to the splitting between the bonding and antibonding minority @xmath11-states , if the spins are oriented in parallel , while this splitting is zero in the afm configuration .",
    "taking a `` prototypical '' tm monatomic chain , we normally observe smaller values of @xmath19 and larger values of @xmath20 for smaller interatomic distance @xmath11 , which promotes the afm kinetic exchange over the fm double exchange . upon increasing the interatomic distance , on the other hand ,",
    "the hopping @xmath20 is decreased while the exchange splitting energy @xmath19 increases reaching the atomic limit value , which promotes the double exchange over the kinetic exchange , and the chain can become ferromagnetic .",
    "this results in the bethe - slater behavior of first exchange parameter @xmath22 for tm chains as a function of interatomic distance : @xmath22 is negative for small @xmath11 and becomes positive for larger @xmath11.@xcite the position of this transition point , where @xmath22 changes sign , depends of course on the transition metal , and is situated close to the equilibrium interatomic distance only for mn chains among all 3@xmath11 tms .",
    "@xcite    here , we investigate the appearance of non - collinear magnetism in freestanding monatomic mn chains , its development upon alloying the chains with the neighbors of mn in the periodic table , i.e.  cr and fe , and finally upon deposition on the cu(110 ) , pd(110 ) and ag(110 ) surfaces . due to the special position of mn chains at the borderline between competing fm and afm exchange interactions , we anticipate the possibility of a spin - spiral ground state in the vicinity of this transition point , where @xmath22 is small , and long - ranged indirect exchange interactions become of importance.@xcite indeed , a whole set of non - collinear solutions has been recently predicted to occur in single - strand as well as thicker infinite and finite freestanding wires of mn atoms,@xcite revealing a sensitive dependence of the exchange interactions on the details of the surroundings , observed also for small deposited mn clusters .",
    "@xcite also in two dimensions the tendency of mn to non - collinear spin ordering is well - established.@xcite while experimentally finite mn chains on cun are believed to display an afm ordering due to super exchange via substrate atoms , a possibility for non - collinear spin ordering has been suggested for long finite mn chains on ni(111 ) from _ ab initio _ calculations due to frustration of competing exchange interactions within the chain and with the surface.@xcite however , structural relaxations , which can strongly influence the magnetic order , were not considered in that study .            in our work ,",
    "we demonstrate that indeed the spin - spiral solution is the ground state of freestanding mn chains in a wide region of interatomic distance @xmath11 between 4.3 and 5.5  a.u .",
    "furthermore , we consider freestanding mn chains alloyed with cr and fe atoms and find that such chains take a smooth trajectory in the magnetic phase space as a function of cr , mn , and fe concentration .",
    "starting from an afm state for cr chains the region of non - collinear solutions is crossed for mn - rich chains until with increasing fe content the fm part of the phase diagram is reached .",
    "this suggests a simple way to tune the magnetic ground state of mn - containing chains and wires .",
    "one can explain this transition within the bethe - slater@xcite as well as moriya picture of direct exchange between @xmath11-states.@xcite we also investigate whether the non - collinear ground state survives for mn chains on a substrate and consider the ( 110)-surfaces of cu , pd , and ag including structural relaxations . our choice of substrates allows us to study the effect of varying interatomic distance in the chains as well as the dependence on the strength of hybridization with the substrate .",
    "we show that owing to the spin - dependent charge transfer between the chain and the surface and reduction of the exchange splitting @xmath19 the exchange interaction changes in favor of antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange , and for mn chains on pd(110 ) the ground state is afm . on the other hand ,",
    "a shallow spin - spiral ground state in the vicinity of the afm solution is retained for mn chains on ag(110 ) and cu(110 ) .",
    "since these surfaces are suitable for chain creation by self - assembly or by manipulation with an stm tip , we simulate stm experiments based on the calculated vacuum charge and magnetization density of states .",
    "we show that the spin spiral magnetic order in supported mn monowires can theoretically be observed in a spin - polarized stm measurement allowing an unambiguous proof of the non - collinear spin structure .",
    "in our first - principles investigation of non - collinear magnetism in monatomic mn chains based on density - functional theory ( dft ) we neglect spin - orbit coupling , which affects the electronic structure , spin , and orbital moments rather weakly for @xmath0 tm chains in general , and mn chains in particular , due to their half - filled @xmath11-shell .",
    "@xcite since we also focus on the metal substrates cu , ag , and pd with relatively small spin - orbit coupling this remains a good approximation throughout our study .",
    "neglecting the spin - orbit interaction allows for an enormous speed - up of the calculations as we need to consider only one tm - atom per unit cell due to the validity of the generalized bloch theorem.@xcite for all calculations we used the gga rev-`pbe ` exchange - correlation functional.@xcite calculations for the freestanding mws have been performed using the one - dimensional flapw method as implemented in the jlich dft code ` fleur`.@xcite we used between 64 and 320 @xmath23-points carefully checking the convergence of the obtained values with respect to their number .",
    "the calculation of the spin - spiral energy dispersions was done with the magnetic force theorem , and we tested its result versus the self - consistent calculations , finding generally very good agreement .",
    "for the basis functions cutoff we used the @xmath24 parameter of more than 4.0  @xmath25 , while we chose values of 6  a.u .  and 7.5  a.u .  for the vacuum parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we used a muffin - tin radius of @xmath28 for mn atoms .",
    "calculations of the surface - deposited monatomic mn chains were performed with the film version of the ` fleur ` code  @xcite with the geometrical setup and computational details close to those in ref .",
    "we modeled the semi - infinite crystal by a slab of seven substrate layers for the fcc-(110 ) surfaces of cu , pd and ag .",
    "we used the experimental lattice constants of the substrates and exploited inversion symmetry by depositing chains on both sides of the slab .",
    "we restricted structural relaxations to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "following values for the muffin - tin radii were used : 2.2  a.u .  for cu atoms , 2.3  a.u .  for pd and ag atoms , 2.2  a.u .  for the chain mn atoms .",
    "we considered an in - plane separation between the chains of approximately 15  a.u .  which corresponds to a @xmath29 unit cell ( see fig .  2 for a sketch of the geometrical setup ) .",
    "this choice of the super - cell provides the separation between adjacent chains large enough to exclude the effect of interchain interaction on the spin - spiral energies and energy scales , discussed in the paper .",
    "we chose values of @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( depending on the surface ) for relaxations and non - collinear calculations , achieving the convergence in the values of the total energy differences and spin moments .",
    "further computational details , values of the spin moments and relaxed atomic positions can be found in ref .",
    "[ ] . for the spin - spiral calculations",
    ", we considered a slab of five substrate layers to simulate the semi - infinite crystal and a dense mesh of 336 @xmath23-points in one half of the brillouin zone .",
    "the calculations of the spin - spiral dispersion curves for deposited mn chains were performed self - consistently .",
    "it was predicted from first - principles calculations@xcite that freestanding mn mws exhibit a ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ground state transition as a function of interatomic distance @xmath11 , a phenomenon that has been later predicted to occur also in mn dimers .",
    "@xcite experimentally , ferromagnetic coupling in mn dimers on nial(110 ) was deduced indirectly from tunneling spectra in stm experiments.@xcite according to the heisenberg model , in the vicinity of the transition point from fm to afm coupling , the nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange parameter , @xmath22 , becomes comparatively small , and exchange constants beyond nearest neighbors become of importance .",
    "this can result in a pronounced non - collinear ground state of mn chains ( cf .",
    "phase diagrams in fig .  1 ) .",
    "indeed , the appearance of a spin - spiral energy minimum has been recently demonstrated by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for free - standing chains as well as more complex structures of mn atoms.@xcite in our work , we investigate how the non - collinear magnetism in mn chains evolves upon stretching the chain and alloying with strongly antiferromagnetic cr and ferromagnetic fe,@xcite alloys that are known to exist in bulk @xmath33-mn , see  e.g.  ref .  [ ]",
    ".    we start by studying the magnetism in pure mn chains in the regime of the interatomic distance @xmath11 around the fm - afm crossover point between 4.3  a.u .  and 5.5  a.u.@xcite when the spacing is varied in this interval , the spin moment of the mn atoms changes by roughly 0.3@xmath34 with respect to the averaged value of 4@xmath34 both for fm and afm solutions .",
    "for each value of @xmath11 the variation of the mn spin moment as a function of the spin - spiral vector @xmath12 is even smaller ( up to 3% ) , which allows a mapping to the heisenberg model . in fig .",
    "[ mn_disp90_pic](a ) we present the energy dispersion relation @xmath13 of spin spirals ( cf .",
    "eq.(3 ) ) for mn chains with different interatomic spacings @xmath11 .",

    "starting already at @xmath38  a.u .",
    "a very shallow spin - spiral energy minimum of @xmath39  mev with respect to the afm state develops at @xmath40 , corresponding to an angle of approximately @xmath41 between spins of nearest neighbor mn atoms .",
    "as the interatomic distance increases this energy minimum becomes deeper , reaching as much as 57.7  mev for a distance of 5.0  a.u .",
    ", and moves towards the middle of the bz with the angle between the spins on neighboring atoms , @xmath42 , becoming smaller . at this distance ,",
    "the difference in energy between the fm and afm state , negative for smaller @xmath11 , nearly vanishes , and upon further increasing @xmath11 , when the fm state moves to lower energies with respect to the afm solution , the non - collinear ground state energy minimum becomes less pronounced again .",
    "remarkably , in the whole range of considered interatomic distance the ground state of the mn chains is non - collinear .    in fig",
    "3(b ) we display the heisenberg exchange constants @xmath43 as a function of the @xmath7th nearest neighbor in the chain extracted from the corresponding @xmath13 dispersion curves in fig .",
    "3(a ) by a fourier transform .",
    "at a lattice constant of 4.3  a.u .",
    "@xmath22 is large and negative , indicating afm exchange coupling that dominates over all other heisenberg constants , which can be considered negligible beyond the 2nd nearest neighbor . among the collinear solutions the afm state",
    "is therefore favored over the fm state by a large value of 340  mev and the spin - spiral minimum is shallow . with increasing @xmath11",
    "the long - range exchange interaction becomes more significant as @xmath22 decreases drastically until it changes its sign to ferromagnetic coupling between 5.0 and 5.5  a.u . between these values of @xmath11 , the 2nd and 3rd nearest exchange constants , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , become of importance and @xmath44 even exceeds the value of @xmath22 , resulting in a deep non - collinear ground state . finally , at @xmath46  a.u .",
    "the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction is ferromagnetic and in the long - range interaction the typical rkky - like behavior is clearly visible . at this and larger distances @xmath11 the magnitude of the exchange constants , the depth of the spin - spiral ground state , and the energy difference between fm and afm state becomes small due to a large separation between the atoms .",
    "the transition from afm to fm nearest - neighbor exchange coupling with increasing interatomic spacing is predicted from the bethe - slater curve ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the mechanism behind this effect can be understood within the alexander - anderson model @xcite of exchange interaction between the @xmath11-states of transition - metal atoms as applied by moriya .",
    "@xcite at small distances , the kinetic exchange interaction , which is antiferromagnetic , dominates for a tm atom with nearly half - filled @xmath11-shell such as mn . as the spacing is increased , the hopping @xmath20 and splitting between bonding and antibonding parts of the @xmath11-states decrease , while exchange splitting @xmath19 normally increases .",
    "this leads to weakening of the kinetic exchange according to @xmath21 dependence , outlined in the introduction . on the other hand , the ferromagnetic double exchange ,",
    "whose energy contribution is proportional to @xmath20 , is also weakened upon stretching , but only linearly in the hopping .",
    "this leads to a crossover between negative @xmath21 and positive @xmath20 parts of the exchange energy at a certain interatomic distance , and the chain becomes ferromagnetic upon further stretching .",
    "we will see in the next section how this competition is changed in favor of kinetic exchange due to hybridization with a substrate .",
    "within the so - called virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) we artificially change the atomic number @xmath47 of the atoms in the chain while keeping the charge neutrality , and investigate the influence of the @xmath0-band filling on the non - collinear magnetism in mn mws . by doing this",
    "we aim at mimicking the behavior of the magnetic ground state upon alloying mn with other elements , as well as charging upon  e.g.  deposition on a substrate .",
    "we perform these calculations at a fixed interatomic distance in the chain of @xmath48  a.u . , roughly corresponding to the equilibrium interatomic distance of the tm chains in the middle of the @xmath0 series.@xcite the atomic number @xmath47 is varied between 24.0 and 26.0 , corresponding to cr and fe chains , respectively , in steps of @xmath49 , which causes a shift of the fermi level @xmath50 within the @xmath0-bands upwards in energy with respect to the fermi energy in the cr chain .",
    "the results of our calculations for the spin - spiral dispersion @xmath13 are presented in fig .",

    "the fm state becomes favorable over the afm configuration , and for an fe chain with @xmath53 , the fm ground state is by more than 0.2  ev  lower in energy than the afm solution , in accordance to previous collinear calculations at this distance .",
    "@xcite at values of @xmath47 around 24.9 a small non - collinear ground state emerges close to the @xmath37-point , which shifts towards the @xmath35-point and becomes more pronounced in energy with increasing @xmath47 until it disappears at @xmath54 .",

    "from this plot we can see that mostly @xmath22 exceeds @xmath44 by an order of magnitude , while , in turn @xmath45 is noticeably smaller than @xmath44 @xmath56 thus , for our analysis we will consider only @xmath22 and @xmath44 heisenberg parameters and trace the position of our chains in the @xmath22-@xmath44 phase space .",
    "the magnetic ground state for the 1d heisenberg model as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath44 is presented in fig .",

    "4(b ) a smooth trajectory of the mw in the @xmath22-@xmath44 phase space . in the regime of @xmath47 close to the pure cr chain",
    "antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange coupling prevails , i.e.  @xmath22 is about @xmath57  mev and very large in comparison to @xmath44 with an absolute value of approximately 20  mev .",
    "accordingly , in this region of @xmath47 the ground state is afm and the mws are situated deeply inside the afm region in the phase diagram of fig .",

    "this boundary is crossed when @xmath47 exceeds 24.9 and the chains reveal a non - collinear ground state until @xmath47 reaches 25.5 . in terms of exchange constants",
    "this happens when upon increasing atomic number , @xmath22 is dramatically decreased so that it becomes comparable to @xmath44 . at @xmath52 @xmath22 vanishes , then it becomes positive and increases , exceeding @xmath58 for @xmath59 @xmath56 correspondingly , the chain becomes ferromagnetic for @xmath47 in the vicinity of fe .",
    "remarkably , the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath47 , displayed in fig .",
    "4(a ) , is very similar to that of the bethe - slater curve , which characterizes the sign of the exchange interaction as a function of @xmath60 , with @xmath11 being the distance between the transition - metal atoms and @xmath61 as spread of the @xmath11-orbitals .",

    "the @xmath61 is larger and for larger @xmath47 the spread is smaller@xcite @xmath56 this results in positioning of the afm cr and fm fe chains on different sides of the bethe - slater curve , with mn chains in the middle at the fm - afm crossover .    a different point of view can be taken by referring to the model of moriya,@xcite , which is an extension of the alexander and anderson model  @xcite for the exchange interaction between transition metals as a function of the number of electrons in the @xmath11-shell .",
    "moriya finds a curve similar to that of bethe - slater if he varies the number of @xmath0-electrons of the interacting transition metal atoms , in complete analogy to @xmath62 presented in fig .",
    "this confirms that while the kinetic exchange mechanism is behind the afm ordering of tms with half - filled @xmath11-shell , the double exchange leads to fm ground state for tms with half - filled @xmath11-spin - subband .",
    "the link between the bethe - slater and moriya pictures of exchange , as outlined in the previous paragraph , is the decrease of the spread of the @xmath11-orbitals , @xmath61 , upon increasing electronic occupation in tm series.@xcite effectively , as far as mn chains are concerned , we can therefore conclude that the effect of the band filling on the magnetic state is the same as that from changing the interatomic distance @xmath11 in the chain .",
    "for the next - nearest and next - next - nearest neighbor exchange interactions , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we find two changes of sign in the considered range of atomic numbers ,  c.f .  fig .",
    "this result is in nice qualitative agreement with the spin susceptibilities for bulk fe calculated by terakura et al .",
    "@xcite as a function of the energy . as the increase of the atomic number in our approach leads to a filling of the @xmath0-band we can compare our result with the spin susceptibilities .",
    "for supported mn chains we consider three different metallic surfaces : unreconstructed cu(110 ) , ag(110 ) and pd(110 ) .",
    "this choice is motivated by several reasons .",
    "firstly , these substrates are rather promising experimentally as they provide trenches for chain self - assembly , while chain creation atom - by - atom by manipulation with an stm tip may also be feasible . secondly ,",
    "as far as we assume that the chains grow pseudomorphically on these surfaces , the interatomic distance between the chain atoms @xmath11 is dictated by the lattice constant of the substrate , taking values of 4.82 , 5.30 and 5.59  a.u .  for cu(110 ) , pd(110 ) and ag(110 ) , respectively . in the previous section",
    "we observed that in this regime of interatomic distance mn chains display a non - collinear ground state , while among the collinear solutions freestanding mn chains favor an afm state for @xmath11 corresponding to that of cu(110 ) , while for the spacing corresponding to pd(110 ) and ag(110 ) the chains prefer a ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "finally , while cu and ag are noble metals with predominantly @xmath63-character of electronic states at the fermi level , the degree of hybridization of mn atoms and the underlying cu or ag substrate is much weaker than that of mn chains deposited on pd , which has high density of states of @xmath1 electrons at the fermi energy .",
    "we can thus compare the effect of hybridization on the exchange interaction of deposited mn mws .",
    "the summary of our calculations is presented in fig .  5 , where the energy dispersion curves @xmath13 are plotted for mn chains on cu(110 ) , pd(110 ) and ag(110 ) , as a function of the @xmath12-vector of a flat spin - spiral propagating along the chain .",
    "we observe that in all cases the energetically favorable state is afm among the collinear solutions , even for mn chains on pd(110 ) and ag(110 ) , which prefer fm ordering in an unsupported situation .",
    "this tendency towards antiferromagnetism in surface - deposited chains and small clusters of @xmath0 tms has been observed previously in refs .  [ ] and [ ] , and stems from the hybridization between the chain and the substrate .",
    "as far as the non - collinear solutions are concerned , we predict that despite strong modifications in the shape of @xmath13 and a tendency towards afm - ordering , a shallow spin - spiral energy minimum retains for mn chain on cu(110 ) ( 3.5  mev below the afm state ) and on ag(110 ) ( 5.5  mev below the afm solution ) .",
    "in contrast , the strong hybridization between the @xmath1-states of the pd surface and the @xmath0-states of mn atoms around the fermi energy leads to a disappearance of the spin - spiral minimum , and the resulting order is antiferromagnetic .    in order to investigate the influence of the substrate on exchange interactions of deposited mn chains in more detail",

    "we observe that while the freestanding mn monowire exhibits a significant energy minimum of @xmath65 with respect to the fm solution of a spin - spiral with an angle of @xmath66 between neighboring spins , the spin - spiral state becomes much less favorable for the chain on the ag(110 ) substrate ( @xmath67 below the afm state ) and the angle shifts to a larger value of @xmath68 .",
    "as already pointed out , the energy difference between the fm and the afm solution is reversed for a mn chain deposited on the substrate .",
    "while the fm state is by 20 mev lower than the afm for the freestanding mn chain , the afm becomes by 40 mev more favorable for the deposited mn chain .",
    "the comparison of the exchange parameters , fig .",
    "6(b ) , which were extracted from the dispersion curves in fig .",
    "6(a ) , underlines the influence of the substrate on the nature of exchange interactions in this system : while the exchange constants beyond the second nearest - neighbor are similar for the freestanding and ag - supported mn chain , the ag(110 ) surface causes a change in sign of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath44 , as compared to the freestanding mn mw .",
    "further , the magnitude of @xmath22 increases significantly , emphasizing predominantly afm - coupling along the deposited chain .",
    "it seems fruitful to analyze the correspondence between the changes in the local mn spin moment @xmath69 upon deposition and the change in the nature of exchange coupling . in general , as it was already reported in ref .",
    "[ ] for the fm and afm state of mn chains on the ( 110)-surfaces of cu , ag , and pd , the value of @xmath69 ( in units of @xmath34 ) is reduced in the fm ( afm ) state from 3.97 ( 3.98 ) for an unsupported mn chain to 3.69 ( 3.75 ) on cu(110 ) , from 4.12 ( 4.20 ) for an unsupported mn chain to 4.00 ( 3.96 ) on pd(110 ) , and from 4.20 ( 4.29 ) for an unsupported mn chain to 4.05 ( 4.12 ) on ag(110 ) .",
    "this reduction of the spin moment comes from spin - dependent changes in the number of electrons inside the mn atomic spheres . while the changes in the local mn spin moment stemming from @xmath63-electrons are rather small upon deposition , owing to small spin - polarization of these states , the changes in the @xmath11-moment and @xmath11-occupation for up and down spins are rather significant .",
    "for example , in the case of the afm mn chain the number of @xmath11-electrons in the spin - up channel is changed from 4.47 in the freestanding state to 4.39 upon deposition on ag(110 ) , while the corresponding values for the spin - down channel constitute 0.27 and 0.37 , respectively .",
    "the values for the changes in the mn @xmath11-occupation upon deposition are quite similar for other substrates and magnetic states of deposited mn chains and a general trend emerges : upon deposition we observe a decrease in the occupation of spin - up electrons , while the number of spin - down electrons increases , with consequent reduction of the total mn spin moment . in a simple picture of the densities of states (",
    "dos ) of a freestanding chain , this situation corresponds to an effective decrease in the value of the interatomic distance @xmath11 , when the chain is deposited on a surface : the spin - down @xmath11-states ( mostly unoccupied in mn ) are shifted to lower energies while the spin - up @xmath11-states ( mostly occupied in mn ) are shifted in the opposite direction , and the overall exchange splitting and the value of the spin moment is reduced .",
    "qualitatively , as we discovered in the previous section , this reduction in interatomic distance has the same effect as the alloying of the mn wire with cr atoms , which results in large and negative @xmath22 exchange parameter , see figs .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) , and the exchange interaction in deposited mn chains leans towards strong antiferromagnetism , as observed in fig .",
    "the reduction of exchange splitting @xmath19 of the mn @xmath11-states upon deposition on a substrate can be seen also from the local densities of states of deposited chains in comparison to the dos in the freestanding configuration . in fig .",
    "[ mndos ] we compare the dos of bare and mn chains deposited on cu(110 ) and ag(110 ) substrates for both collinear spin configurations , i.e.  fm and afm states .",
    "the reduction of @xmath19 , defined as the difference between the center of mass of spin - up ( red ) and spin - down ( blue ) mn states , upon deposition on the surface can be easily seen in these plots .",
    "it is especially pronounced for the case of a mn chain deposited on ag(110 ) , both in the fm and afm configuration . in this case",
    "the distance @xmath11 between the mn atoms along the chain is larger and the corresponding peaks in the dos are sharper than in the case of the mn chain deposited on cu(110 ) which imposes a smaller mn - mn distance .",
    "as can be seen , upon deposition on ag(110 ) the value of the exchange splitting can be reduced by as much as 0.3@xmath560.4  ev as compared to the freestanding value of @xmath19 . in case of cu(110 ) the mn states are rather spread in energy for both structural cases and the center of mass of the @xmath11-bands is more difficult to determine , however , even in this case the reduction of the exchange energy upon deposition is quite visible .    in terms of the alexander - anderson model , outlined in the previous sections ,",
    "the reduction in the value of @xmath19 promotes the antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange over ferromagnetic double exchange between the mn atoms .",
    "another subtle point in this competition , which was pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] , is that the gain in energy due to double exchange is smaller for a chain on a surface than it is for a free - standing chain .",
    "if the @xmath11-states are resonant with the background hybridization , e.g.  due to the presense of a substrate , the tails of the bonding and antibonding resonances cross the fermi energy , and their repopulation partly counteracts the energy gain due to double exchange in a bare chain.@xcite at the end , due to enhancement of the kinetic exchange and weakening of the double exchange , mn chains , situated right at the fm - afm crossover point , become antiferromagnetic when deposited on a substrate .",
    "an experimental verification of the predicted non - collinear magnetic ground state of mn chains on ag(110 ) and on cu(110 ) is very challenging as the atomic chain structure needs to be revealed and individual chains have to be addressed .",
    "in addition , the magnetic signal is small due to the low amount of magnetic material and in any spin - spiral state the magnetization is compensated on the atomic length - scale .",
    "therefore , there are few experimental techniques suitable for this challenge . in recent years",
    ", it has been demonstrated that spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) is a powerful tool to image magnetic order of individual nanostructures down to the atomic - scale  @xcite and non - collinear spin structures in ultra - thin films have been observed .",
    "@xcite as calculated sp - stm images based on the spin - polarized extension of the tersoff - hamann model  @xcite are in excellent agreement with the experimental data , we have performed such simulations for the system of deposited atomic chains , taking mn chains on cu(110 ) as an example .    before we turn to the predicted sp - stm images ,",
    "it is insightful to analyze the partial charge and magnetization density obtained from our first - principles calculations in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "as we are interested in the contrast obtainable with sp - stm , we depict these quantities in the vacuum a few ngstrm above the mn chain atoms .",
    "figure  [ dens_0.4_pic ] displays such a top view of the mn chain on cu(110 ) with a spin - spiral magnetic state characterized by the vector @xmath70 .",
    "this magnetic structure is close to the absolute minimum in total energy ( see fig .  [ dispersion_all_sub_pic ] ) , and it is commensurate with the atomic lattice with a relatively small pitch of 5 atoms allowing a simple discussion .    in the magnetization density ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ dens_0.4_pic ] ) the location of the mn atoms can be clearly seen while the vacuum charge density ( bottom panel ) only resolves the chain direction .",
    "the @xmath71- and @xmath72-direction of the magnetization ( center panels ) already hint at the contrast expected with a magnetic stm tip which is sensitive to a magnetization component given by its own magnetization direction .",
    "we find that the maxima and minima need not correspond to the atom positions and that the images can change qualitatively with the tip magnetization .",
    "a further striking point is evident from the local magnetization ( top panel ) , i.e.  the rotation of the magnetization density is not uniform . above the atom sites the rotation is slow and in between it is much faster .",
    "another interesting feature which can be seen in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ dens_0.4_pic ] is that the direction of the magnetization in the vacuum coincides with that inside the mn atoms .",
    "this appears somewhat counterintuitive , since , according to the density of states of the mn chain on cu(110 ) presented in fig .",
    "[ mndos ] , the minority states dominate in the region around the fermi level . in order to resolve this discrepancy , in fig .",
    "[ vacuum_dos ] we plot the spin- and orbitally - resolved local dos inside the mn spheres together with the ldos in the vacuum at a distance of @xmath73    from the mn chain on cu(110 ) in its ferromagnetic state ( the case of the antiferromagnetic mn chain is essentially analogous ) .",
    "the orbitally - resolved ldos ( fig .",
    "[ vacuum_dos](a ) ) shows that these are the mn @xmath11-states which dominate at @xmath50 for both spin directions , and while for spin - down the @xmath11-dos is quite large , for spin - up it is rather small and featureless , owing to the exchange splitting which shifts the position of the spin - up @xmath11-states deep below the fermi level . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation with the ldos in the vacuum is completely opposite , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ vacuum_dos](b ) . for minority spin , the vacuum ldos around @xmath50 is very small , increasing drastically in value only above 1 ev .",
    "however , the vacuum ldos of spin - up electrons is very large and dominates the total ldos in a large window around @xmath50 and determines the direction of the local magnetization dos in the vacuum above the mn atoms , presented in fig .",
    "[ dens_0.4_pic ] .    by comparing figs .",
    "[ vacuum_dos](a ) and ( b ) we can see that the structure of the spin - up vacuum ldos in the energy window [ @xmath74  ev,@xmath75  ev ] is in very nice correspondence to the @xmath63-dos of the mn atom .",
    "in particular , the peaks in the @xmath63-dos at around @xmath76  ev , @xmath77  ev , @xmath78  ev , @xmath79  ev and the peak directly at the fermi energy can be clearly seen also in the majority vacuum ldos , while the @xmath11-dos is quite featureless for energies above @xmath80  ev in this spin channel .",
    "this suggests , that the magnetization in the vacuum high above the chain is actually driven by spin - polarized @xmath63- and @xmath81-electrons which reach further into the vacuum , rather than localized @xmath11-states .",
    "the spin - polarization of the @xmath63- and @xmath81-states stems from their hybridization with the @xmath11-electrons in the chain , which influence their bonding properties .",
    "while the majority @xmath63- and @xmath81-states bare an anti - bonding character with respect to the interaction with the substrate , the minority @xmath63- and @xmath81-states are bonded stronger to the cu(110 ) surface , which makes their spread into the vacuum much smaller .",
    "the latter scenario has been also recently observed and explained from first - principles for deposited magnetic adatoms and their clusters@xcite as originating from the reduced coordination and symmetry of the adsorbates .",
    "this explains why the localized mn spin moment due to spin - up states well below the fermi energy is collinear with the magnetization density in the vacuum , obtained by integrating the states in a small window around @xmath50 .",
    "such a correspondence between the direction of the atomic spin moment in the deposited chain and the vacuum magnetization was also found for biatomic fe chains on an ir substrate.@xcite    now we turn to the calculated spin - polarized stm images which have been obtained applying the spin - polarized version of the tersoff - hamann model  @xcite and using the electronic structure calculated within dft .",
    "figure  [ current_y_pic ] displays the result for a tip magnetization along the @xmath72-direction .",
    "the upper two panels show the non - spin - polarized and the spin - polarized component of the tunneling current , respectively , at a fixed distance from the chain atoms of 5.9   .",
    "as expected the atom positions are not resolved in the non - spin - polarized part of the current within the tersoff - hamann approximation .",
    "the apparent width of the chain is about 2   .",
    "the spin - polarized part , on the other hand , clearly shows the five atom periodicity of the spin spiral structure with @xmath70 which implies an angle of @xmath82 between the spins of neighboring atoms . in the total tunneling current , the superstructure due to the magnetic signal is still visible , but it is slightly damped due to the large contribution from the non - spin - polarized part .",
    "therefore , the spin structure should be resolvable within an sp - stm experiment .    in order to quantify the contrast we have calculated the corrugation amplitude by simulating a line scan along the chain axis in the constant - current mode .",
    "we have chosen the starting point of the scan lines at a height of 5.9   which fixes the constant current .",
    "the obtained scan lines , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ current_y_pic ] , reveal an asymmetric profile and the maxima and minima of the spin - polarized stm image do not necessarily coincide with atom positions .",
    "we find a corrugation amplitude , i.e.  the maximum height change as the tip moves along the chain , of about 0.08   .",
    "this value is above the resolution limit of stm ( cf .",
    "measurements of spin spirals in ref .",
    "[ ] ) and is enhanced at smaller tip - sample distance and larger tip spin - polarization ( a value of 0.4 has been assumed here ) .    in fig .  [ current_x_pic ]",
    "the predicted sp - stm images are displayed for a tip magnetization along the @xmath71-axis .",
    "the five atom periodicity is again apparent from the plot and a three - fold contrast pattern is also observed . the main difference between a tip magnetization , @xmath83 , pointing into the @xmath71- and @xmath72-direction ,",
    "respectively , is that there are atoms whose magnetic moments point directly into the @xmath71-direction , but there are no atoms whose magnetic moments directly point into the @xmath72-direction . at some points",
    "the maximum of the spin - polarized corrugation is therefore directly localized above the atom sites in the case of @xmath83 pointing into the @xmath71-direction , while when @xmath83 pointing into the @xmath72-direction this is never the case .",
    "for this reason , the two schemes are not only shifted with respect to each other , but look substantially different . in fig .",
    "[ current_x_pic ] the third and the fourth atom are equivalent in the sense that their magnetizations have the same @xmath33 component and therefore they produce the same contrast .",
    "the same argument holds for atom 2 and 5 . on the contrary , in the case of @xmath83 pointing in the @xmath72-direction",
    "these atoms are not equivalent .",
    "interestingly , the vacuum magnetization can be well reproduced within a simple model of sp - stm ,  @xcite which relies only on a knowledge of the magnetic structure and assumes a spherical exponential decay of the wave functions .",
    "therefore , the discussed sp - stm images could have also been obtained within this much faster approach .",
    "simulations for spin spirals with a different pitch , i.e.  other values of @xmath12 , are therefore easily possible in this way .",
    "we have performed an _ ab initio _ study of the non - collinear magnetism in freestanding and deposited monatomic mn chains neglecting the effect of spin - orbit coupling , which is relatively small in our systems .",
    "we find that the spin - spiral magnetic state is the ground state of unsupported mn chains in a large interval of distance between the atoms .",
    "we were able to attribute the appearance of non - collinear magnetism in this system to the existence of a ferromagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic transition point . in the vicinity of this point the nearest - neighbor exchange parameter changes sign and",
    "is on the order of exchange interactions beyond nearest neighbors , which promotes an energy minimum of a spin - spiral state .",
    "we also demonstrate , within the virtual crystal approximation , that upon alloying chains of mn with cr and fe the ground state of mn chains can be controlled .",
    "in particular , while cr - rich mn chains are antiferromagnets , upon increasing the mn concentration they exhibit a spin spiral ground state . upon mixing mn chains with fe",
    "a transition from a non - collinear ground state to the fm state occurs .",
    "the trajectory which mn chains take in the magnetic phase space upon alloying with cr and fe is therefore smooth .    for mn chains on the ( 110 ) surfaces of fcc cu , pd and ag we observe an overall strong tendency towards antiferromagnetism . as a result , among",
    "the considered substrates only cu(110 ) and ag(110 ) allow for a spin - spiral ground state in the deposited mn chains close to the afm solution with a modest gain in energy of 3.5 and 5.5  mev over the afm state , respectively .",
    "we attribute this suppression of the tendency of mn chains towards non - collinear magnetism , which is extremely pronounced for unsupported chains , to the effect of the hybridization with the substrate . within the alexander - anderson model of exchange between @xmath11-states",
    "it can be shown that the hybridization weakens the ferromagnetic double exchange mechanism and the antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange interaction prevails.@xcite    an effect which can enhance the spin - spiral minimum of mn chains on heavier substrates lies in the spin - orbit driven dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi).@xcite irrespective of its sign , adding the dmi contribution to the spin - spiral dispersion curve would make the spin - spiral minimum in the vicinity of the collinear afm solution more pronounced , owing to the anti - symmetric nature of this energy correction with respect to the spin - spiral vector .",
    "the dmi energy contribution will have to compete with another manifestation of the spin - orbit coupling in these systems @xmath56 the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy , which we , however , expect to be rather small for considered deposited chains .",
    "taking into account the stabilization of the magnetization by the weak spin - orbit coupling in mn chains on the cu and ag substrates , we predict that the spin - spiral state in deposited mn chains can be observed experimentally via ,  e.g. , sp - stm techniques .",
    "based on the vacuum charge and magnetization density of supported mn chains on cu(110 ) we calculate sp - stm images , which can provide a conclusive evidence for a non - collinear ground state spin - structure in mn chains .",
