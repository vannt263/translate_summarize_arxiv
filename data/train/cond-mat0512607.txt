    "we assume as a model for cuo layers in high @xmath0 cuprates the 2d @xmath1-@xmath2 model . however , neglecting from beginning the n.n.n . hopping all features depending on the detailed structure of the fermi surface",
    "are clearly lost . gauging with a chern - simons gauge field action the spin and the charge global symmetries of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model one",
    "obtains a gauged @xmath1-@xmath2 model strictly equivalent to the original @xcite .",
    "the spin - charge gauged model suggests an improved `` mean field approximation '' ( mfa ) based on a formal spin - charge decomposition of the electron field @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the low energy effective action describes spin @xmath7 gapful bosonic spinons , with a non - linear sigma ( nl@xmath8 ) model action , and charged fermionic holons interacting via a slave - particle gauge field .",
    "peculiar to our approach and present both in the `` pseudogap '' and `` strange metal phases '' ( although here less effective ) is the spinon gap @xmath9 .",
    "it is due to spin vortices attached by the spin gauge field in mfa to the empty - site positions and at high temperature it receives the standard thermal correction of the nl@xmath8 model .",
    "the theoretically derived @xmath10 dependence of the spinon gap up to @xmath11 is in qualitative agreement with the behavior of the af correlation length in underdoped lsco @xcite .    in the `` pseudogap phase '' ( pg , at low @xmath6 and @xmath4 ) the holons have `` small '' fermi surface @xmath12 and a `` dirac structure '' induced via hofstadter mechanism by the @xmath13-flux lattice of the charge - gauge field in mfa , with bare dispersion @xmath14 restricted to the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "the main effect of gauge fluctuations is to induce a a shift in the mass of spinons @xcite @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant and @xmath17 the diamagnetic susceptibility , thus introducing a dissipation @xmath18 .",
    "the competition between the two energy scales , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , is the root in our approach of many crossover phenomena peculiar to in - plane transport properties of the `` pseudogap phase '' @xcite .",
    "in particular it yields an explanation of the metal - insulator crossover ( mic ) observed in underdoped , non - superconducting cuprates as temperature decreases @xcite , @xcite and a similar crossover in superconducting cuprates when a strong magnetic field suppresses superconductivity @xcite .",
    "hence , in our approach the mic is due to correlation effects , not to a disorder - induced localization which would be hard to reconcile with the experimental fact that @xmath21 at mic ranges from o(0.1 ) to o(10 ) , i.e. well below and well above ioffe - regel limit .",
    "furthermore the gauge interaction induces the binding of spinon and anti - spinon into a massive damped magnon resonance and ( close to the fermi surface ) of spinon and holon into an `` electron '' resonance with a @xmath22-dependent wave function renormalization constant @xmath23 and inverse life - time @xmath24 .",
    "this energy scale , i.e. the recombination rate , dominates the out - of - plane resistivity , yielding an insulating behavior .",
    "the `` dirac dispersion '' of holons induces a reduction of the spectral weight outside the magnetic brillouin zone , reminiscent of the `` fermi arcs '' found in arpes in underdoped cuprates @xcite , see fig.1 .",
    "around a temperature @xmath25 ( identifiable as the inflection point of in - plane resistivity ) the @xmath13-flux lattice of the charge gauge field melts and we enter in the `` strange metal phase '' ( sm , at high @xmath6 or @xmath4 ) . in such phase @xcite , holons have `` large '' fermi surface @xmath26 and standard dispersion .",
    "the gauge fluctuations induce still the formation of a strongly overdamped magnon resonance , with inverse life - time @xmath27 and an `` electron resonance '' with inverse life - time , @xmath28 , of the same order and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the typical scale of gauge fluctuations , where @xmath31 is their landau damping , and can be thought of as a sort of anomalous skin depth .",
    "consistently with experimental data , linear in @xmath4 behaviour of in - plane and out - of - plane resistivity and spin relaxation time @xmath32 is recovered at large enough @xmath4 , as a consequence of the above life - time and the `` effectiveness '' of the gauge fluctuations in a slab of momenta @xmath33 around the fermi surface : in fact the conductivity derived from boltzmann transport theory would be @xmath34 , but due to `` effectiveness '' the physical conductivity is @xmath35 .",
    "_ in - plane resistivity",
    "_    it is calculated via ioffe - larkin addition rule @xcite , a typical feature of slave - particle gauge theories : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the resistivity of the spinon - gauge subsystem and @xmath38 of the holon - gauge subsystem , subdominant .",
    "kubo formula applied to @xmath37 gives in the pg in the range @xmath39 ( roughly from few tenth to few hundreds k ) where the approximations made appear reliable ,      thus one recovers the metal - insulator - crossover ( mic ) and an inflection point @xmath41 ( since @xmath42 in pg ) at higher temperature , found also experimentally @xcite ; see fig .",
    "one easily verifies that the normalized resistivity @xmath43 is a function only of the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "therefore a prediction of the theory is a universal behaviour which in fact can be verified in experimental data and was already empirically remarked in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane yields a shift of the mic at higher temperature and this in turn produces a big positive transverse magnetoresistance @xcite , as found in experiments @xcite .    in sm one obtains , for @xmath45 ( roughly from few tenth to 500 k ) , where the approximation made in our approach are reasonable : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant . in the high temperature limit @xmath48 , the damping rate in ( [ asympt ] ) dominates over the spin gap @xmath49 and the spinon contribution to resistivity is linear in @xmath4 , with a slope @xmath50 , see fig .",
    "5 . lowering the temperature , the second term in ( [ asympt ] ) gives rise first to a superlinear behavior and then , at the margin of validity of our approach , an unphysical upturn .",
    "the deviation from linearity is due to the spin gap effects and is cutoff in the underdoped samples by the crossover to the pg phase .",
    "we expect that physically in the overdoped samples it is cutoff by a crossover to a fl``phase '' .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spinon mass yields a bending at high temperature , stronger for lower dopings , as visible in the resistivity data at constant volume for lsco @xcite ; this effect is masked in the resistivity data at constant pressure @xcite by thermal expansion .",
    "we compute the electronic ac conductivity via kubo formula , in the two limits @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the external frequency .",
    "it turns out that up to the logarithmic accuracy one can pass from the first to the second limit by replacing @xmath4 with @xmath53 in @xmath54 and @xmath28 ( we denote the obtained quantities by @xmath55 ) and rescaling @xmath28 by a positive multiplicative factor @xmath56 . in pg , in the range @xmath57 the ac conductivity",
    "can be approximately obtained from @xmath58 derived from eq .",
    "( [ rpg ] ) substituting @xmath4 with @xmath59 .",
    "hence it exhibits a broad maximum at a frequency , @xmath60 , corresponding to a temperature slightly higher than @xmath61 , as in fact experimentally seen in @xcite , see fig .",
    "an @xmath62 anisotropy of @xmath61 and @xmath60 found in underdoped lsco @xcite would be generated naturally in the above scheme by an @xmath62 anisotropy of the magnetic correlation length @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath61 strengthens our interpretation of correlation - induced mic , since a disorder - induced localization is expected to have a unique mic temperature .",
    "as @xmath4 becomes greater than @xmath53 the ac conductivity becomes approximately @xmath53 independent .",
    "in sm , for @xmath51 we have @xmath63 while for @xmath64 @xmath65 from the above formulas the following features found experimentally in overdoped lsco @xcite and bsco @xcite are easily derived : besides the standard tail @xmath66 , the effect of replacing @xmath54 by @xmath67 is to asymmetrize the peak at @xmath68 appearing in re@xmath69 for @xmath51 and to shift it towards lower frequency , see fig .",
    ".          therefore , in the high temperature limit we recover the linear in @xmath4 behavior for @xmath5 and at high doping / low temperature the superlinear deviation , also found experimentally in overdoped samples of lsco.@xcite , see fig . 10 .",
    "furthermore , the factor @xmath73 weakens the doping dependence of the slope as compared with the resistivity curves , in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we assume an incoherent transport along c - direction .",
    "@xmath74 thus is dominated by virtual hopping between layers and it is calculated via kumar- jayannavar formula @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath28 is the inverse electron life time , given here by the spinon - holon recombination rate , @xmath76 is an effective average hopping in the @xmath16-direction and @xmath77 the density of states at the fermi energy . in pg the first term in ( [ kuma ] )",
    "dominates , yielding the insulating behaviour : @xmath78 .",
    "this crossover reproduces a knee experimentally found in @xcite , see fig .",
    "the very strong decrease with @xmath4 of the anisotropy ratio @xmath79 in pg is also well reproduced by the above formulas , see fig .",
    "12 .    in the sm",
    "phase the second , metallic , term in ( [ kuma ] ) dominates and substituting @xmath28 and @xmath23 one recovers the @xmath80linearity in the `` incoherent regime '' @xmath81 : @xmath82 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ kuma ] ) yields possibly a minimum at low @xmath4 ( if in the admissible range ) see fig . 13 .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt have a reliable method to estimate the ( extrapolated ) @xmath83 intercept of @xmath84 which is large when compared with the corresponding intercept for @xmath85plane resistivity , so we can not extract safely the anisotropy ratio @xmath79 .",
    "however , if the minimum in @xmath74 is at higher temperature than the ( unphysical ) minimum in @xmath86 , then one can derive the fast decrease of the anisotropy ratio at low temperature found experimentally,@xcite , see fig .",
