    "in public health studies , clustered or longitudinal binary responses may be collected on a group of individuals where only a subset of these individuals are susceptible to having a positive response .",
    "for example , questionnaires may ask teenagers who are dating to answer a series of questions about dating violence . as in the next generation health study , a larger proportion of all zero responses are observed than would occur by chance ; presumably many individuals who are not dating filled in all zeros on the questionnaire ( also known as `` structural zeros '' ) .",
    "while there may be alternative reasons for structural zeros , for example , participants giving socially desirable responses , we believe this accounts for only a small fraction of zero inflation .",
    "interest is in making inference about the correlated binary responses for those who are susceptible ( i.e. , inference about dating violence among individuals who were dating ) .",
    "there is an extensive literature on zero - inflated poisson and binomial models [ @xcite ; @xcite ] that provide early references , along with more recent work on zero - inflated ordinal data [ @xcite ] and zero - inflated sum score data with randomized responses [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite reviewed various statistical models incorporating zero inflation in both discrete and continuous outcomes for cross - sectional data .",
    "@xcite discussed cross - sectional binary regression with zero inflation , and proved the model identifiability when at least one covariate is continuous . @xcite",
    "first considered longitudinal or clustered data with zero - inflated binomial or poisson outcomes .",
    "they incorporated a random effect structure to model the within - subject correlation and proposed an em algorithm to estimate the parameters .",
    "@xcite extended the work of @xcite by proposing a generalized estimation equation ( gee ) approach to model several zero - inflated distributions in a longitudinal setting .",
    "@xcite presented a hurdle model with random effects for repeated measures of zero - inflated count data .",
    "there has been no work , however , on zero - inflated clustered binary data .    a component of the next generation health study examines the prevalence and correlates of dating violence among 2787 tenth - grade students , following them over seven years .",
    "dating violence is common among adolescents , may impact adolescent expectations regarding adult intimate relationships [ @xcite ] , and has been found to be associated with increased risk of depression and engagement in high - risk behaviors [ @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "thus , dating violence among adolescents merits interest from both developmental and public health perspectives [ @xcite ] .",
    "investigators involved in the next study are primarily interested in identifying the risk factors associated with dating violence .",
    "@xcite found a relationship between high - risk behaviors ( i.e. , depressive symptoms , alcohol use , smoking and drug use ) , gender and the prevalence of dating violence victimization .",
    "a total of 10 questions were asked about dating violence .",
    "five of the questions were on dating violence victimization : did your partner ( 1 ) insult you in front of others , ( 2 ) swear at you , ( 3 ) threaten you , ( 4 ) push or shove you , or ( 5 ) throw anything that could hurt you ; the other five were similar questions on perpetration : did you ( 1 ) insult your partner in front of others , ( 2 ) swear at your partner , ( 3 ) threaten your partner , ( 4 ) push or shove your partner , or ( 5 ) throw anything that could hurt your partner ? as illustrated in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the distribution of the number of `` yes '' responses is clumped at zero .",
    "when we fit the frequencies with a zero - inflated binomial distribution , the zero - inflation probability is estimated to be about 58% .",
    "the binomial distribution yields a poor fit to the frequencies for two reasons .",
    "first , the prevalence of `` yes '' responses is unequal across different questions ; second , the responses from the same subject are correlated .",
    "but this only serves as an intuitive visualization of zero inflation .",
    "one can argue that the clump of zeros might be due to the high correlation of the binary responses within the same subject ; and , therefore , we also fit the generalized linear mixed model ( glmm ) and plot the fitted frequencies in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "glmm attempts to fit the spike at 0 , and hence tends to overestimate the within - subject correlation . in this paper , we hope to explore whether zero inflation exists while allowing for the cluster effects .",
    "we propose maximum - likelihood ( ml ) and gee approaches to simultaneously account for the zero inflation and clustering in the multiple binary responses .",
    "the major difference between our work and the previous work is that @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all considered the zero inflation at the observation level ,  while in our paper the zero inflation is at the subject level  ( meaning that with a structural zero , all the binary responses from a subject are zero ) . for our dating violence example , subjects have all zero responses because they are not susceptible to the condition ( e.g. , in a relationship ) .",
    "the proposed methods are evaluated and compared in simulation studies .",
    "we then reexamine the relationships between high - risk behaviors and dating violence among teenagers using the proposed analysis strategy accounting for zero inflation .",
    "in section  [ sec2 ] we present both maximum - likelihood and gee approaches for parameter estimation .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] discusses the identifiability of the proposed model and proposes a likelihood ratio test for zero inflation .",
    "simulation study results are presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the next dating violence data is analyzed in section  [ sec5 ] , and a discussion follows in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be the multivariate binary outcome for subject @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath3 be the corresponding matrix of covariates .",
    "let @xmath4 be the latent class , so that @xmath5 always takes the value of @xmath6 ( structural zero ) if @xmath7 , and @xmath5 follows a multivariate binary distribution with density @xmath8 if @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a vector of parameters .",
    "we suppress the subscript  @xmath1 when there is no confusion .",
    "let @xmath11 be the prevalence of the latent class  1 . in our example",
    ", @xmath9 indicates that subject @xmath1 is susceptible to the possibility of dating violence ( i.e. , potential of answering the dating violence questions in a positive fashion ) , while @xmath7 indicates that the subject is not susceptible .",
    "if both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are observed , the individual contribution to the full data likelihood is @xmath14 the observed likelihood of @xmath12 is then given by @xmath15 here we assume that the zero - inflation probability @xmath16 is the same across all the subjects in the sample .",
    "this could easily be extended to allow @xmath16 to depend on covariates , for example , with a logistic regression model .",
    "we use a generalized linear mixed effects model ( glmm ) to describe the multivariate distribution , @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the vector of random effects following the multivariate normal distribution @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the design matrix of the random effects , and @xmath23 is the known link function .",
    "the parameter vector @xmath10 consists of the parameter of interest @xmath24 and the nuisance parameters in the variance component @xmath25 .",
    "assume @xmath26 s are mutually independent given @xmath27 and @xmath20 , and let @xmath28 be the probability density function of @xmath20 .",
    "then the likelihood for subject @xmath1 becomes @xmath29 the integral with respect to the random effects can be approximated by gaussian ",
    "hermite quadrature as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32th quadrature grid point and @xmath33 is the associated weight [ @xcite ] .",
    "the parameter estimation for @xmath16 and @xmath10 can be found by maximizing the log - likelihood for all @xmath34 subjects , @xmath35 .",
    "the variance estimation is calculated from the inverse of the observed information : @xmath36 and can be implemented by the ` optim ` function in ` r ` [ @xcite ] .",
    "likelihood - based inference makes full distributional assumptions on @xmath37 .",
    "when these assumptions are correct , the estimator gains efficiency ; otherwise , classical inference has poor statistical properties .",
    "we explore the estimating equations approach [ @xcite ] that only specifies a structure for the conditional mean @xmath38 .",
    "suppose @xmath39 where @xmath23 is the known link function and @xmath40 is the regression coefficients of interest .",
    "unconditional on @xmath4 , the `` marginal '' mean of @xmath5 is given by @xmath41 the estimating equations can then be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the working covariance matrix for @xmath5 [ @xcite ] .",
    "we can decompose @xmath44 as @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the diagonal matrix of the variance of @xmath26 [ which is @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the working correlation matrix specified by some nuisance parameter @xmath49 .",
    "if the mean model ( [ eq0-mean ] ) is correct , the estimating equations ( [ eq1-gee1 ] ) are always consistent regardless of the working correlation , and choosing an approximately correct working correlation generally leads to improved efficiency . in the context of zero - inflated regression , we propose two ways to specify the working correlation : marginal and conditional specification .",
    "the marginal correlation directly makes assumptions on @xmath48 , which is similar to the standard gee : the _ marginal independent correlation _ assumes @xmath50 , the @xmath51-dimensional identity matrix ; the _ marginal exchangeable correlation _ assumes that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the @xmath54 square matrix of ones .",
    "we refer to these two different approaches as gee - mi and gee - me , respectively .",
    "the conditional correlation exploits the zero - inflated structure and utilizes the conditional covariance , @xmath55 , to derive the unconditional covariance @xmath56 .",
    "a similar idea was first used by @xcite to derive their gee estimator for observation - level zero inflation . by the law of total covariance , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60 element of @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the @xmath63th element of @xmath64 .",
    "the variance of @xmath26 is given by @xmath65 .",
    "conditional independence correlation _ assumes that @xmath66 , so the working correlation is @xmath67 with the @xmath60 element as @xmath68 the _ conditional exchangeable correlation _ assumes that @xmath69 that is , a correlation of @xmath70 between any @xmath26 and @xmath71 _ given _ @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath60 element of the working correlation @xmath73 is @xmath74 we refer to these conditional gee approaches as gee - ci and gee - ce , respectively .",
    "similar to the ordinary gee , an unstructured working correlation can be assumed that allows for distinct correlations for each pair of outcomes . with the unstructured gee , the marginal and conditional specification of working correlation",
    "are equivalent , that is , @xmath75 we refer to this approach as gee - un .    with each of the five forms of working correlation matrices",
    ", we could solve  ( [ eq1-gee1 ] ) using the newton  raphson method to obtain the corresponding parameter estimates @xmath76 . with the exchangeable or unstructured correlation structure",
    ", we iteratively update @xmath70 from its moment estimator and @xmath40 from equation ( [ eq1-gee1 ] ) [ @xcite ] . according to the standard theory of gee , the variance of the estimated @xmath76 has the usual sandwich form @xmath77 , where @xmath78      we note that the regression parameters in the glmm and gee are not directly comparable as they have different interpretations .",
    "the former is interpreted as the `` subject - specific effect '' conditional on a subject  @xmath1 , while the latter is the `` population - averaged effect '' or `` marginal effect '' [ @xcite ] .",
    "thus , glmm and gee are not compatible for nonidentity link functions . in other words , if the glmm is true , the marginal expectation by integrating out the random effects @xmath20 may not preserve the linear additive form of the covariates .",
    "however , for binary regression with a probit link and random intercept , glmm and gee are compatible .",
    "we adopt a probit random effects model for both the simulations and example analysis .",
    "let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be the c.d.f . and p.d.f .",
    "of the standard normal distribution .",
    "consider the generalized linear mixed effects model with a probit link and a random intercept only , @xmath81 by integrating out @xmath82 , the marginal probability of @xmath26 is computed as follows : @xmath83 while glmm estimates @xmath84 , gee estimates @xmath85 .",
    "the latter is a probit regression model as well , with the regression coefficients , @xmath86 .",
    "this allows us to compare the performance of glmm and gee by comparing the marginal effects of the covariates , which is our interest in the dating violence analysis of the next study .",
    "in general , zero - inflated models are mixtures of two parametric parts , a point mass at zero ( equivalently , a  binary distribution with @xmath87 ) and a parametric distribution for the nonstructural zero part .",
    "typically , zero - inflated models are identified by observing a larger number of zeros than would be consistent with the parametric model .",
    "for example , with poisson or binomial outcomes , one can observe excessive proportion of zeros with a histogram .",
    "for a single binary outcome , zero inflation can not be distinguished from rare events , unless covariate dependence is introduced . when there is a continuous covariate @xmath88 , zero inflation is identified because of the linear effect of @xmath88 on the binary response through a known link function .",
    "@xcite proved a weaker sufficient condition for identifiability when covariates are all categorical : to identify a two component mixture of logistic regressions with a binary response , the covariate vector needs to take at least 7 distinct values .",
    "@xcite also used the same argument to prove the identifiability of zero - inflated ordinal regression .",
    "single binary outcome can be seen as a special case of our proposed model with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as more information is available with @xmath91 , our model is also identified under follmann and lambert s condition .",
    "@xcite proved the model identifiability for the zero - inflated binary regression with at least one continuous covariate . using a similar technique",
    ", we can prove our model identifiability .",
    "for gee with a probit link , consider @xmath92 and @xmath93 to be two parameter vectors that yield the same conditional mean @xmath94 , that is , @xmath95 equivalently , @xmath96 .",
    "suppose the @xmath97th component of @xmath98 ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) is continuous , then we can take the partial derivative with respect to @xmath99 , which yields @xmath100 taking the partial derivative on both sides of ( [ eq2-iden ] ) with respect to @xmath99 , and with some algebra , it follows that @xmath101 , and hence @xmath102 . from ( [ eq1-iden ] ) , we further get @xmath103 .",
    "this proves the identifiability gee - ci and gee - mi . in gee - un",
    ", the association parameters are indeed obtained from a moment estimator of the correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath71 .",
    "since the mean model is identified , the variance and correlation are also identified . for exchangeable working correlation ,",
    "the association parameter is the `` average '' correlation between all @xmath26 and @xmath71 pairs with @xmath57 , which is identifiable as well .",
    "we now prove the identifiability of the random effects model ( [ eq0-glmm ] ) with a probit link .",
    "with normally distributed random effects , the mean of @xmath26 could be marginalized as @xmath104 , where @xmath25 is the variance  covariance matrix of random effects  @xmath20 .",
    "we further assume that a continuous covariate is contained in @xmath98 but not in  @xmath105 .",
    "then the same argument of ( [ eq2-iden ] ) still applies by denoting @xmath106 as @xmath40 , which proves the identifiability of the regression coefficients up to a scale .",
    "now it suffices to prove the identifiability of @xmath25 .",
    "denote @xmath107 as the correlation coefficient of @xmath26 and @xmath71 ( @xmath57 ) given @xmath72 .",
    "note that from section  [ sec2.2 ] , we have @xmath108 since @xmath40 is identifiable , @xmath109 is also identifiable .",
    "therefore , if two parameter vectors @xmath110 and @xmath111 lead to the same @xmath112 and @xmath113 , @xmath107 must be the same . furthermore , the regular glmm is identifiable , suggesting that the correlation structure @xmath107 conditional on @xmath72 is uniquely defined by @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we prove @xmath114 , and , consequently , the identifiability of the ml estimator is established .",
    "we also note that when @xmath90 and no covariates are available , the repeated binary counts could be collapsed into a binomial distribution .",
    "the problem then reduces to the zero - inflated binomial model , which is clearly identifiable . in the presence of the random effects ,",
    "collapsing the binary counts leads to an over - dispersed binomial distribution .",
    "@xcite discussed the zero - inflated beta - binomial model , where the over - dispersion is controlled by a beta distributed random intercept .",
    "our model assumes that the over - dispersion comes from a normal distributed random intercept .",
    "another way to view the proposed model is a mixture of random effect distributions . recall that @xmath26 follows a bernoulli distribution with probability @xmath115 , given by @xmath116 instead of introducing the latent class @xmath4",
    ", we assume that @xmath20 is a mixture of normal distribution and a point mass at @xmath117 : @xmath118 when @xmath119 , the probability @xmath115 is always 0 for @xmath120 , so @xmath5 is the structural zero .",
    "it is easy to show that the likelihood is exactly the same as the proposed model .    in practice , one may wish to test for the existence of zero inflation , which can be performed under the parametric model framework .",
    "the likelihood ratio statistic is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the maximized log - likelihood for the zero - inflated model , and @xmath123 is the maximized log - likelihood for the ordinary glmm .",
    "as the null hypothesis ( @xmath87 ) is on the boundary of the parameter space , the asymptotic null distribution of @xmath124 is a mixture of @xmath125 and point mass at 0 , with equal mixture probabilities [ @xcite ] .",
    "theoretically , we could also construct a score test statistic similar to the test proposed by @xcite for zero inflation in a poisson distribution .",
    "however , for our problem , the likelihood function involves intractable integrals , making the score and information matrix both difficult to evaluate .",
    "so in our application , we apply the likelihood ratio test .",
    "motivated by the next study , the data generation for the simulation studies mimics the real example . to evaluate the statistical properties of the above methods , simulation studies of the true model and a misspecified model",
    "were run with two different levels of within - cluster correlation",
    ". a sample size of @xmath126 with a cluster size of @xmath127 questions is considered .",
    "the simulations were repeated 5000 times to compare the performance of the naive estimator ( glmm , where the zero - inflation is ignored ) , the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimator and the five gee estimators ( gee - mi , gee - ci , gee - me , gee - ce and gee - un ) .",
    "we calculated the average ( mean ) and standard deviation ( sd ) of the estimated parameters , average of the estimated standard errors ( se ) and 95% ci coverage rates ( cover ) based on the wald intervals to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of the gee and the maximum - likelihood approaches .",
    "twenty gaussian ",
    "hermite quadrature points were used for computing the glmm and ml estimators .",
    "we also tried 10 and 40 quadrature points as well as the adaptive quadrature with 250 simulated data sets . in our simulations , the results are very similar for differing number of quadrature points .",
    "our experience for generalized linear mixed models with the logit link function is that gaussian quadrature works very well , and in most situations agq is not needed . in terms of numerical efficiency",
    ", we found that the computation time for agq is about 1020 times longer than the fixed quadrature .",

    "we suspect that a majority of them were not in a relationship , but answered all the dating violence questions with `` no .",
    "'' however , there may be alternative reasons for the zero inflation , for example , some kids may give socially desirable answers in the survey and hence underreport dating violence .",
    "however , we believe that this only accounts for a small fraction of the structural zeros .",
    "the likelihood ratio test statistic for zero inflation is @xmath172 ( @xmath16-value@xmath1730.001 ) .",
    "the parameter estimations by gee are generally close to ml , but the standard errors are larger . the naive glmm method estimated smaller covariate effects , which could be biased due to ignoring the zero - inflated nature of the data .",
    "as pointed out by a referee , the zero - inflation problem could be avoided by including a filter question of asking whether the subject had a relationship or not . the filter question was not included because the study investigators felt that it was an unreliable question to ask .",
    "relationships between teenagers today can not easily be characterized , and the investigators felt that explicitly asking this question may limit important responses about violence [ @xcite ] .",
    "there are other cases where the susceptible population can not be ascertained accurately .",
    "for example , in drug abuse studies , specifically asking whether individuals are drug abusers might not be a question that would result in a reliable response .",
    "but we may be interested in whether the abusers seek particular types of treatment .",
    "additionally , this approach may be relevant to questions regarding immigration status , where there may be legal implications ( perceived or real ) in answering , and in questions on mental health status , where the respondent may have a reduced ability to accurately report their status .",
    "in public health research , excessive zero responses may occur if the population which is susceptible to respond is not carefully screened or is unknown .",
    "the resulting zero inflation may have an effect on the results obtained by conventional methods of analysis . in the next generation health study , investigators were interested in identifying predictors of dating violence in teenagers . examining these regression relationships are of interest for those individuals who are in a relationship ( i.e. , the susceptible condition ) .",
    "many more individuals completed this study component than investigators thought would be in a relationship at this age .",
    "this led to what appears to be zero - inflated clustered binary data .",
    "we developed both ml and gee approaches for analyzing such data . through simulations and analysis of the real data example",
    ", we found that the ml approach is substantially more efficient than the gee approaches .",
    "however , under moderate model misspecification , the ml approach may result in biased inference .",
    "it is recommended that , as a sensitivity analysis , both ml and gee approaches be applied in applications .    in the gee approach ,",
    "we treat the regression parameters and nuisance working correlation as orthogonal , that is , a gee1 approach with the parameters in the working correlation estimated by a moment estimator .",
    "potential efficiency gain could be achieved using an improved version of gee1 [ @xcite ] or gee2 [ prentice and zhao ( @xcite ) ; liang , zeger and qaqish ( @xcite ) ] , by establishing another set of estimating equations on the second moment .",
    "however , gee2 requires a correct variance structure with working third and fourth moment model , which is hard to verify with the presence of zero inflation , and results in bias under second , third and fourth moment misspecification .",
    "the previous work of @xcite adopted prentice and zhao s gee2 that maintains the parameter orthogonality in their second moment estimating equations , and they argued that only making a first moment assumption may lead to parameter nonidentifiability .",
    "this is true in their case , where the zero - inflation probability is at the observation level , so @xmath174 and @xmath62 might be confounded in @xmath175 .",
    "however , in the case of subject - level zero inflation , we have shown the model identifiability of the gee1 estimators .    in principle , zero - inflated models can not be identified nonparametrically ; parametric assumptions for the nonzero part play a fundamental role in model estimation .",
    "for example , zero inflation in poisson and binomial data can be determined by the lack of fit in the zero cells of these respective distributions . in this paper , we assume that the nonzero distribution is given by a generalized linear mixed model with normal random effects .",
    "the ml approach exploits the correlation structure in order to distinguish structural zeros and random zeros .",
    "intrinsically , gee only uses the mean structure of the binary data in order to estimate regression parameters and , unlike ml , does not use the entire distribution for estimation .    in our application , there were very few missing data",
    ". however , in many studies with sensitive psychological or behavioral questions , there may be informative missingness .",
    "an advantage of the ml approach is that it can more easily be extended to account for informative missing responses [ see @xcite , e.g. ] .",
    "the proposed methodology implicitly assumes that the subjects answer the questions truthfully .",
    "if this assumption does not hold , the parameter estimation is likely to be biased .",
    "we could formulate a likelihood approach if we had good prior information about the distribution of false negative occurrence across the questions .",
    "this would require a verification subsample corresponding to the survey questions ( maybe obtained through interviews of parents and friends ) on a fraction of teenagers .    the zero - inflation probability in our model is assumed to be constant , but it is straightforward to include covariates in both ml and gee approaches . in addition , our focus is on a cross - sectional inference , that is , analyzing the dating violence data at one point in time ( 11th grade ) .",
    "understanding behavior change from adolescence over time is interesting but also challenging . in the longitudinal",
    "setting , the zero - inflation probability is time - dependent that can probably be modeled by a latent markov process .",
    "we will leave it for future exploration .",
    "we greatly appreciate and enjoyed reading the very insightful comments and suggestions by the associate editor and two anonymous referees .",
    "their comments not only remarkably improved the quality of the paper , but also motivated our deeper thoughts of possible extensions of the methodology in the future ."
