    "interaction of ultrashort and strong optical laser pulse with solids has been a subject of intensive theoretical and experimental research during the last few decades .",
    "@xcite the interest in this field has grown after experimental realization of short laser pulses with just a few oscillations of optical field , which is comparable to the internal fields of a solid.@xcite such high intensity optical pulses strongly affect the electron dynamics and strongly modify the transport and optical properties of solids within the duration of the pulse,@xcite which is a few femtosecond - long .",
    "the response of electron system of a solid to the optical field of the pulse strongly depends on the band structure of the solid .    for dielectrics , the main energy parameter , which determines the interaction of a solid with the laser pulse , is the bandgap @xmath0 between the occupied valence band and the empty conduction band .",
    "if the pulse frequency is small , @xmath1 , then the electron dynamics can be described in terms of the dynamics of the passage through anticrossing points of quasistationary wannier - stark levels of conduction and valence bands in time dependent electric field of the laser pulse.@xcite the passage through such anticrossing points determines whether the electron dynamics is adiabatic or diabatic .",
    "the last anticrossing point corresponds to the electric field of the strength @xmath2 .",
    "such field can also be defined as the field which induces a change in electron potential energy by @xmath3 over the lattice period @xmath4  . for silica with bandgap @xmath5 ev ,",
    "the critical field is @xmath6 v /  . at such electric field ,",
    "i.e. at the last anticrossing point of wannier - stark levels , the interband coupling is strong , which results in strong mixing of conduction and valence band states .",
    "such mixing results in strong enhancement of dielectric response of the solid.@xcite    in addition to the enhancement of dielectric susceptibility of the solid , the response of the electron system of dielectrics to a strong optical pulse shows another interesting property .",
    "namely , the deviation of electron dynamics from adiabatic one results in finite charge transfer @xmath7 through the system during the pulse.@xcite for an ultrastrong pulse , the effective conductivity calculated from the transferred charge , @xmath8 , is enhanced by almost 18 orders in magnitude compared to its low - field value .",
    "the direction of the charge transfer is the same as the direction of the pulse maximum . for ultrashort laser pulse ,",
    "the electron dynamics is also highly reversible , i.e. the electron system almost returns to its initial state after the pulse ends .",
    "such reversibility was demonstrated both experimentally@xcite and numerically.@xcite thus , within the duration of ultrashort and strong laser pulse , the insulator shows strong enhancement of both dielectric response and electrical conductivity with highly reversible dynamics .    in metals , where the conduction band is partially occupied",
    ", the main effect of interaction of ultrashort optical pulse with solid is strong modification of intraband electron dynamics.@xcite the electron dynamics in strong optical pulse shows high frequency bloch oscillations , which is visible in the generated electric current and in the shape of the optical pulse transmitted through the metal nanofilm.@xcite in addition to such oscillations the highly nonlinear electron dynamics in ultrastrong optical pulse results in strong enhancement of the pulse transmittance through the metal nanofilm.@xcite similar to dielectrics , the optical pulse also generates the transferred electric charge , but now the direction of the charge transfer is opposite to the direction of the pulse maximum .    in the present paper",

    "the purely two dimensional electron dynamics in graphene is characterized by unique dispersion relation , the low energy part of which is relativistic with linear dependence of the electron energy on momentum .",
    "the behavior of such low energy electrons is described by the dirac relativistic massless equation .",
    "therefore , graphene is a semimetal with zero bandgap and relativistic low - energy dispersion . in this case",
    "the interaction of the laser pulse with graphene should show some similarity to the behavior of a metal in strong optical pulse , where the intraband electron dynamics determines the response of the electron system .",
    "zero bandgap should also result in strong interband mixing of the states of the valence and conduction bands .",
    "below we consider femtosecond - long laser pulses , for which the duration of the pulse is less than the electron scattering time , which is of the order of 1 ps.@xcite in this case the electron dynamics is coherent and is described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation , where the time dependence is introduced through the time - dependent electric field of the optical pulse .",
    "the dynamics of graphene in long optical pulse with duration of hundred femtosecond , for which the scattering processes become important and the electron dynamics is incoherent , has been studied in ref .   within the density matrix approach , where the sensitivity of the hot - electron fermi distribution to the intensity of the optical pulse were reported .",
