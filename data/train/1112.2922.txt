    "a large fraction of the sdb stars ( @xmath6 ) are short period binaries @xcite with periods ranging from only @xmath7 to more than @xmath8 .",
    "close binary sdbs are most likely formed by common envelope ( ce ) ejection @xcite . however , it is difficult to determine the nature of the close companions in sdb binaries .",
    "because most of them are single - lined , only lower mass limits have been derived from the binary mass functions , which are in general compatible with late main sequence stars of spectral type m or compact objects like white dwarfs . only in rare cases ( e.g. eclipsing systems )",
    "it is possible to distinguish between these two options .",
    "subdwarf binaries with massive wd companions turned out to be candidates for supernova type ia ( sn ia ) progenitors because these systems lose angular momentum due to the emission of gravitational waves and shrink .",
    "mass transfer or the subsequent merger of the system may cause the wd to reach the chandrasekhar limit and explode as a sn  ia .",
    "one of the best known candidate systems for the double degenerate merger scenario is the sdb+wd binary kpd1930@xmath92752 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed high resolution spectra of single - lined sdb binaries .",
    "because the inclinations of these systems are unknown , additional information is required to derive masses .",
    "@xcite measured the surface gravities and projected rotational velocities .",
    "assuming synchronised orbits the masses and the nature of the unseen companions was constrained .",
    "surprisingly , some companions may be either massive white dwarfs , neutron stars ( ns ) or stellar mass black holes ( bh ) .",
    "however , the assumption of orbital synchronisation in close sdb binaries was shown to be not always justified and the analysis suffers from selection effects @xcite .",
    "the existence of sdb+ns / bh systems is predicted by binary evolution theory @xcite .",
    "the formation channel includes two phases of unstable mass transfer and one supernova explosion and the fraction of those systems is consistently predicted to be about @xmath10 . if the companion were a neutron star , it could be detectable by radio observations as a pulsar .",
    "@xcite searched for pulsed radio emission at the positions of four candidate systems from @xcite using the green bank radio telescope , but did not detect any signals .",
    "we started a radial velocity ( rv ) survey ( massive unseen companions to hot faint underluminous stars from sdss , muchfuss ) to find sdbs with compact companions like supermassive white dwarfs ( @xmath11 ) , neutron stars or black holes @xcite .",
    "the same selection criteria that we applied to find such binaries are also well suited to single out hot subdwarf stars with constant high radial velocities in the galactic halo like extreme population ii and hypervelocity stars ( see heber et al .",

    "for the muchfuss project the target selection is optimised to find massive compact companions in close orbits around sdb stars ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "includes sdss data release 6 , we have now extended the selection to data release 7 .",
    "hot subdwarf candidates were selected by applying a colour cut to sdss photometry .",
    "all point source spectra within the colours @xmath12 and @xmath13 were selected and downloaded from the sdss data archive server . by visual inspection",

    "the sample contains @xmath15 hot subdwarfs .",
    "we excluded sdbs with radial velocities ( rvs ) lower than @xmath16 to filter out such binaries with normal disc kinematics , by far the majority of the sample .",

    ", we discovered @xmath23 new sdb binaries with radial velocity variations on short time scales ( @xmath24 ) . in total",

    "in addition @xmath25 he - sdos show signs of rv variability .",
    "this fraction was unexpected since in the spy sample only @xmath26 of these stars turned out to be rv variable @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear what causes this rv variability . up to now",
    "we were not able to derive the orbital parameters of any such object and prove , that it is a close binary star .      in order to select the most promising targets for follow - up",
    ", we carried out numerical simulations and estimated the probability for a subdwarf binary with known rv shift to host a massive compact companion .",
    "we created a mock sample of sdbs with a close binary fraction of @xmath27 and adopted the distribution of orbital periods of the known sdb binaries .",
    "two rvs were taken from the model rv curves at random times and the rv difference was calculated for each of the @xmath28 binaries in the simulation sample . since the individual sdss spectra were taken within short timespans , another simulation was carried out , where the first rv was taken at a random time , but the second one just @xmath29 later .",

    "@xmath44 sdos have main sequence companions , while @xmath45 sdos , most of which show helium enrichment , are single - lined",
    ".    the fraction of close binaries among the hot subdwarf stars in sdss can be estimated by taking a look at the objects with more than one epoch of spectroscopy .",
    "@xmath46 stars ( @xmath47 sdb / sdob , @xmath48 he - sdo , @xmath49 sdb+ms ) from our sample have at least two epochs of observations .",
    "@xmath50 of the sdbs and sdobs are rv variable , while only one he - sdo ( @xmath51 ) and one sdb with a visible companion ( @xmath52 ) show variability . due to the small sample size",
    "the last two numbers should be regarded as upper limits at most .",
    "the binary fraction of the sdb stars is closer to the one found in the spy project ( @xmath53 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than to the higher fraction of @xmath54 reported by @xcite .",
    "follow - up medium resolution ( @xmath55 ) spectra were taken during dedicated follow - up runs with eso - ntt / efosc2 , wht / isis , caha-3.5m / twin , int / ids , soar / goodman and gemini - n / gmos .",
    "orbital parameters of eight sdb binaries discovered in the course of the muchfuss project have been determined so far @xcite .",
    "since the programme stars are single - lined spectroscopic binaries , only their mass functions @xmath56 can be calculated .",
    "although the rv semi - amplitude @xmath57 and the period @xmath58 can be derived from the rv curve , the sdb mass @xmath59 , the companion mass @xmath60 and the inclination angle @xmath61 remain free parameters . adopting the canonical mass for core helium - burning stars @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "we derive a lower limit for the companion mass .    depending on this minimum mass",
    "a qualitative classification of the companions nature is possible in certain cases . for minimum companion masses lower than @xmath64",
    "a main sequence companion can not be excluded because its luminosity would be too low to be detectable in the optical spectra @xcite . in this case",
    "the companion can be a compact object like a wd or a late main sequence star .",
    "if the minimum companion mass exceeds @xmath64 and no spectral signatures of the companion are visible , it must be a compact object .",
    "if this mass limit exceeds @xmath65 or even the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath66 ) the existence of a supermassive wd or even an ns or bh companion is proven .",
    "the minimum companion masses of seven binaries are similar ( @xmath67 ) . from these minimum masses alone the nature of the companions can not be constrained unambiguously .",
    "however , the fact that all seven objects belong to the sdb binary population with the highest minimum masses illustrates that our target selection is efficient and singles out sdb binaries with massive companions @xcite .",
    "photometric follow - up allows us to clarify the nature of the companions . short period sdb binaries with late main sequence or",
    "substellar companions show variability in their light curves caused by the irradiated surfaces of the cool companions facing the hot subdwarf stars . if this so - called reflection effect is present , the companion is most likely a main sequence star . if not , the companion is most likely a compact object . in the case of the short period system",
    "j1138@xmath680035 a light curve taken by the superwasp project shows no variation exceeding @xmath69 .",
    "the companion is therefore most likely a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "we obtained follow - up photometry with the mercator telescope and the busca instrument mounted on the caha-2.2 m telescope . in this way we discovered the first eclipsing sdb binary j082053.53 + 000843.4 to host a brown dwarf companion with a mass ranging from @xmath70 to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the very similar eclipsing system j162256.66 + 473051.1 was discovered serendipituously ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : j1622 ] ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows that the orbital period is very short ( @xmath72 ) and the rv semi - amplitude quite low ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the companion is most likely a substellar object as well .",
    "the high success rate in finding these objects shows that our target selection not only singles out sdb binaries with high rv - amplitudes , but also systems with very short orbital periods .",
    "low - mass stellar and substellar companions may yet play an underestimated role in the formation of sdb stars ( see geier et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "most recently , we detected p - mode pulsations in the sdb j012022.94 + 395059.4 ( fbs0117 + 396 , * ? ? ? * ) as well as a longer trend indicative of a reflection effect in a light curve taken with busca .",
    "only a few of the known short - period sdb pulsators ( sdbv@xmath74 ) are in close binary systems .",
    "more observations are needed to determine the orbital parameters of this system .",
    "the muchfuss project aims at finding hot subdwarf stars with massive compact companions .",
    "we identified 1369 hot subdwarfs by colour selection and visual inspection of the sdss - dr7 spectra .",
    "the best candidates for massive compact companions are followed up with time resolved medium resolution spectroscopy . up to now",
    "orbital solutions have been found for eight single - lined binaries .",
    "seven of them have large minimum companion masses compared to the sample of known close binaries , which shows that our target selection works quite well .",
    "however , it turns out that our selection strategy also allows us to detect low - mass companions to sdbs in very close orbits .",
    "we discovered an eclipsing sdb with a brown dwarf companion and a very similar candidate system in the course of our photometric follow - up campaign .",
    "these early results encourage us to go on , because they demonstrate that muchfuss will find both massive and substellar companions to sdb stars .",
