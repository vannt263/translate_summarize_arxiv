    "actually , we can obtain from by using the result obtained by kotani and sunada @xcite , which asserts that the eigenvalues of @xmath20 with the largest absolute value are given by @xmath28 for @xmath29 . as the prime number theorem is obtained via the riemann zeta function , these formulas are also related to the zeta function @xmath30 ,",

    "to state the result , we need a generalization of the jacobi polynomial : for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , define @xmath48    \\alpha_1 + 1,\\ldots,\\alpha_d+1 \\end{array } ; \\,\\frac{1-x}{2},\\ldots,\\frac{1-x}{2 } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the pochhammer symbol with @xmath50 being the gamma function , @xmath51 and , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the lauricella multivariable hypergeometric function of type @xmath0 . remark that @xmath54 is equal to the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath55 and hence @xmath56 coincides with the classical jacobi polynomial .",

    "we give some numerical examples and observations obtained from the examples .",
    "we see that , in this case , our formula seems to give a graph analogue of a refinement of the prime geodesic theorem for compact riemannian manifolds of negative curvature , which counts closed geodesics lying in a fixed homology class .",

    "<S> the discrete tori are graph analogues of the real tori , which are defined by the cayley graphs of a finite product of finite cyclic groups . in this paper , using the theory of the heat kernel on the discrete tori established by chinta , jorgenson and karlsson , we derive an explicit prime geodesic theorem for the discrete tori , which is not an asymptotic formula . to describe the formula , we need generalizations of the classical jacobi polynomials , which are defined by the lauricella multivariable hypergeometric function of type @xmath0 .    _ primary _ 11m36 _ secondary _ 05c30 , 33c65    discrete tori , prime geodesic theorem , heat kernels on graphs , lauricella hypergeometric functions , jacobi polynomials . </S>"
