    "by now there is convincing evidence for solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",

    "for the @xmath5 we have : @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as for the mixing angles , two are large and one is small .",
    "the atmospheric angle @xmath0 is large , actually compatible with maximal but not necessarily so : at @xmath8 : @xmath9 with central value around @xmath10 .",
    "the solar angle @xmath11 is large , @xmath12 , but certainly not maximal ( by about 5 - 6 @xmath13 now @xcite ) .",
    "the third angle @xmath1 , strongly limited mainly by the chooz experiment , has at present a @xmath8 upper limit given by about @xmath14 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in spite of this experimental progress there are still many alternative routes in constructing models of neutrino masses .",
    "this variety is mostly due to the considerable ambiguities that remain .",
    "first of all , it is essential to know whether the lsnd signal @xcite , which has not been confirmed by karmen@xcite and is currently being double - checked by miniboone@xcite , will be confirmed or will be excluded .",
    "if lsnd is right we probably need at least four light neutrinos ; if not we can do with only the three known ones , as we assume here in the following .",
    "as neutrino oscillations only determine mass squared differences a crucial missing input is the absolute scale of neutrino masses ( within the existing limits from terrestrial experiments and cosmology @xcite,@xcite ) .    the following experimental information on the absolute scale of neutrino masses is available . from the endpoint of tritium beta decay spectrum we have an absolute upper limit of 2.2 ev ( at 95% c.l . ) on the mass of `` @xmath15 '' @xcite , which , combined with the observed oscillation frequencies under the assumption of three cpt - invariant light neutrinos , represents also an upper bound on the masses of all active neutrinos .",
    "complementary information on the sum of neutrino masses is also provided by the galaxy power spectrum combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies . according to the recent analysis of the wmap collaboration @xcite , @xmath16 ev ( at 95% c.l . ) .",
    "more conservative analyses give @xmath17 ev , still much more restrictive than the laboratory bound .",
    "but , to some extent , the cosmological bound depends on a number of assumptions ( or , in fashionable terms , priors ) .",
    "however , for 3 degenerate neutrinos of mass @xmath18 , depending on our degree of confidence in the cosmological bound , we can be sure that @xmath19 .",
    "the discovery of @xmath20 decay would be very important because it would directly establish lepton number violation and the majorana nature of @xmath21 s , and provide direct information on the absolute scale of neutrino masses .",
    "the present limit from @xmath20 is @xmath22 ev or to be more conservative @xmath23 ev , where @xmath24 in terms of the mixing matrix and the mass eigenvalues ( see eq.([3nu1gen ] ) .",
    "given that neutrino masses are certainly extremely small , it is really difficult from the theory point of view to avoid the conclusion that l conservation is probably violated .",
    "in fact , in terms of lepton number violation the smallness of neutrino masses can be naturally explained as inversely proportional to the very large scale where l is violated , of order @xmath25 or even @xmath26 .",
    "given for granted that neutrinos are majorana particles , their masses can arise either from the see - saw mechanism or from generic dimension - five non renormalizable operators @xcite of the form : o_5=+  h.c .",
    ", [ o5 ] with @xmath27 being the ordinary higgs doublet , @xmath28 the su(2 ) lepton doublets , @xmath29 a matrix in flavour space , @xmath30 a large scale of mass and a charge conjugation matrix @xmath31 between the lepton fields is understood .",
    "neutrino masses generated by @xmath32 are of the order @xmath33 for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the vacuum expectation value of the ordinary higgs .",
    "apriori comparable masses are obtained in the see - saw mechanism : the resulting neutrino mass matrix reads : m_=m_d^t m^-1m_d  .",
    "that is the light neutrino masses are quadratic in the dirac masses and inversely proportional to the large majorana mass . for @xmath36 ev and @xmath37 with @xmath38",
    "we find @xmath39 which indeed is an impressive indication for @xmath25 .",
    "thus neutrino masses are a probe into the physics at @xmath25 .",
    "if we take maximal @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and keep only linear terms in @xmath42 , from experiment we find the following structure of the @xmath43 ( @xmath44,@xmath45,@xmath46 , @xmath47 ) mixing matrix , apart from sign convention redefinitions : & & u_fi= + & & ( ) , [ ufi1 ] + even for three neutrinos the pattern of the neutrino mass spectrum is still undetermined : it can be approximately degenerate , or of the inverse hierarchy type or normally hierarchical . given the observed frequencies and the notation @xmath48 , @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the three possible patterns of mass eigenvalues are : & & : |m_1|~|m_2| ~|m_3||m_i - m_j| + & & : |m_1|~|m_2| |m_3| + & & : |m_3| |m_2,1[abc ] models based on all these patterns have been proposed and studied and all are in fact viable at present .",
    "the detection of neutrino - less double beta decay would offer a way to possibly disintangle the 3 cases .",
    "the quantity which is bound by experiments is the 11 entry of the @xmath21 mass matrix , which in general , from @xmath52 , is given by : m_ee  = ( 1-s^2_13 )  ( m_1 c^2_12  +  m_2 s^2_12)+m_3 e^2",
    "i s^2_13 , [ 3nu1gen ] starting from this general formula it is simple to derive the following bounds for degenerate , inverse hierarchy or normal hierarchy mass patterns , .",
    "* degenerate case . if @xmath53 is the common mass and we take @xmath54 , which is a safe approximation in this case , because @xmath55 can not compensate for the smallness of @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 . here",
    "the phase ambiguity has been reduced to a sign ambiguity which is sufficient for deriving bounds .",
    "so , depending on the sign we have @xmath58 or @xmath59 . we conclude that in this case @xmath60 could be as large as the present experimental limit but should be at least of order @xmath61 unless the solar angle is practically maximal , in which case the minus sign option can be arbitrarily small .",
    "but the experimental 2-@xmath13 range of the solar angle does not favour a cancellation by more than a factor of about 3 . *",
    "inverse hierarchy case . in this case",
    "the same approximate formula @xmath62 holds because @xmath63 is small and @xmath56 can be neglected .",
    "the difference is that here we know that @xmath64 so that @xmath65 ev . at the same time , since a full cancellation between the two contributions can not take place , we expect @xmath66 ev . * normal hierarchy case . here",
    "we can not in general neglect the @xmath63 term .",
    "however in this case @xmath67 and we have the bound @xmath68 a few @xmath69 ev .",
    "recently some evidence for @xmath20 was claimed @xcite corresponding to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 in a more conservative estimate of the involved nuclear matrix elements ) .",
    "if confirmed this would rule out cases b ) and c ) and point to case a ) or to models with more than 3 neutrinos .",
    "after kamland , sno and wmap not too much hierarchy in neutrino masses is indicated by experiments : r = m_sol^2/m_atm^2 ~1/35.[r ] precisely at @xmath8 : @xmath72 .",
    "thus , for a hierarchical spectrum , @xmath73 , which is comparable to the cabibbo angle @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests that the same hierarchy parameters ( raised to powers with o(1 ) exponents ) are at work for quark , charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices .",
    "this in turn indicates that , in absence of some special dynamical reason , we do not expect a quantity like @xmath1 to be too small",
    ". indeed it would be very important to know how small the mixing angle @xmath1 is and how close to maximal is @xmath0 .",
    "actually one can make a distinction between `` normal '' and `` special '' models .",
    "for normal models @xmath0 is not too close to maximal and @xmath1 is not too small , typically a small power of the self - suggesting order parameter @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "special models are those where some symmetry or dynamical feature assures in a natural way the near vanishing of @xmath1 and/or of @xmath4 .",
    "normal models are conceptually more economical and much simpler to construct . typical categories of normal models are    * anarchy : models with approximately degenerate mass spectrum and no ordering principle , no approximate symmetry assumed in the neutrino mass sector @xcite @xcite .",
    "the small value of r is accidental , due to random fluctuations of matrix elements in the dirac and majorana neutrino mass matrices .",
    "the see - saw formula being a product of 3 matrices generates a broad distribution of r values resulting from random input in each factor .",
    "all mixing angles are generically large : so we do not expect @xmath0 to be maximal nor @xmath1 to be too small .",
    "* semianarchy : we have seen that anarchy is the absence of structure in the neutrino sector .",
    "here we consider an attenuation of anarchy where the absence of structure is limited to the 23 sector .",
    "the typical texture is in this case @xcite @xcite : m_m ( + ccc & & + & 1&1 + & 1 & 1 + ) [ s - an ]  , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are small and by 1 we mean entries of @xmath78 and also the 23 determinant is of @xmath78 .",
    "this texture can be realized for example with different u(1 ) charges for @xmath79 , eg @xmath80 appearing in the dim",
    ". 5 operator of eq.([o5 ] ) .",
    "clearly , in general we would expect two mass eigenvalues of order 1 , in units of @xmath18 , and one small , of order @xmath76 or @xmath81 .",
    "this pattern does not fit the observed solar and atmospheric observed frequencies .",
    "however , given that the ratio @xmath82 is not too small , we can assume that its small value is generated accidentally , as for anarchy .",
    "we see that , if by chance the second eigenvalue @xmath83 , we can then obtain the correct value of @xmath82 with large but in general non maximal @xmath0 and @xmath11 and small @xmath84 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath1 is the main advantage over anarchy , but the relation with @xmath2 normally keeps @xmath1 not too small ( eg @xmath85 in simple u(1 ) models ) .",
    "* in the limit of exact @xmath86 symmetry we have inverted hierarchy with @xmath87 and bi - maximal mixing ( both @xmath11 and @xmath0 are maximal ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "simple forms of symmetry breaking can not sufficiently displace @xmath11 from the maximal value because typically @xmath88 .",
    "viable normal models are obtained by arranging large contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath11 from the charged lepton mass diagonalization .",
    "but then , in order to obtain the measured value of @xmath11 the size of @xmath1 must be close to its present upper bound . *",
    "normal hierarchy models with 23 determinant suppressed by see - saw @xcite : in the 23 sector one needs relatively large mass splittings to fit the small value of @xmath82 but nearly maximal mixing .",
    "this can be obtained if the 23 sub - determinant is suppressed by some dynamical trick .",
    "typical examples are lopsided models @xcite @xcite @xcite with large off diagonal term in the dirac matrices of charged leptons and/or neutrinos ( in minimal su(5 ) the d - quark and charged lepton mass matrices are one the transposed of the other , so that large left - handed mixings for charged leptons correspond to large unobservable right - handed mixings for d - quarks ) .",
    "another typical example is the dominance in the see - saw formula of a small eigenvalue in @xmath89 , the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "when the 23 determinant suppression is implemented in a 33 context , normally @xmath1 is not protected from contributions that vanish with the 23 determinant , hence with @xmath82 .",
    "the fact that some neutrino mixing angles are large and even nearly maximal , while surprising at the start , was eventually found to be well compatible with a unified picture of quark and lepton masses within guts .",
    "the symmetry group at @xmath25 could be either ( susy ) su(5 ) or so(10 ) or a larger group .",
    "for example , normal models based on anarchy , semianarchy , inverted hierarchy or normal hierarchy can all be naturally implemented by simple assignments of u(1)@xmath90 horizontal charges in a semiquantitative unified description of all quark and lepton masses in susy su(5)@xmath91 u(1)@xmath90 . actually , in this context , if one adopts a statistical criterium , hierarchical models appear to be preferred over anarchy and among them normal hierarchy appears the most likely .    in conclusion",
    "we expect that experiment will eventually find that @xmath1 is not too small and that @xmath0 is sizably not maximal .",
    "but if , on the contrary , either @xmath1 very small or @xmath0 very close to maximal will emerge from experiment or both , then theory will need to cope with this fact .",
    "one can imagine other types of special models , for example one where , starting from the lagrangian basis where the symmetries of the model are specified , all neutrino mixings arise from the diagonalisation of the charged lepton mass matrix . in ref .",
    "@xcite we argue that , in presence of two large mixing angles , this dominance of charged lepton mass diagonalization does not `` normally '' happen , although we can devise special tricks to enforce this possibility .",
    "in particular we have constructed an example which is natural in the technical sense and moreover has a very small @xmath1 , so that it is a special model also in this respect .",
    "it is interesting to conceive and explore dynamical structures that could lead to special models in a natural way .",
    "normal models have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , so we concentrate here on examples of special models .",
    "we want to discuss here some particularly special models where both @xmath1 and @xmath4 exactly vanish .",
    "then the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath43 ( @xmath44,@xmath45,@xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , in the basis of diagonal charged leptons , is given by , apart from sign convention redefinitions : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 stand for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "it is much simpler to write natural models of this type with @xmath94 small and thus many such attempts are present in the early literature .",
    "more recently , given the experimental value of @xmath11 , the more complicated case of @xmath94 large was also attacked , using non abelian symmetries , either continuous or discrete @xcite . in the flavour basis the general form of the neutrino mass matrix for @xmath97 ( no cp violation ! ) and @xmath0 maximal is given by : @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ grimus ] ) 4 real parameters appear corresponding to 3 eigenvalues plus @xmath11 . in many examples",
    "the invoked symmetries are particularly ad hoc and/or no sufficient attention is devoted to corrections from higher dimensional operators that can spoil the pattern arranged at tree level and to the highly non trivial vacuum alignment problems that arise if naturalness is required also at the level of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "an interesting special case of eq .",
    "( [ ufi1 ] ) is obtained for @xmath99 , i.e. the so - called tri - bimaximal or harrison - perkins - scott mixing pattern ( hps ) @xcite , with the entries in the second column all equal to @xmath100 in absolute value : @xmath101 this matrix is a good approximation to present data .",
    ", to be compared with the latest experimental determination @xcite : @xmath102 .",
    "] this is a most special model where not only @xmath1 and @xmath4 vanish but also @xmath11 assumes a particular value . clearly , in a natural realization of this model ,",
    "a very constraining and predictive dynamics must be underlying .",
    "interesting ideas on how to obtain the hps mixing matrix have been discussed in refs @xcite .",
    "the most attractive models are based on the discrete symmetry @xmath103 , which appears as particularly suitable for the purpose , and were presented in ref .",
    "here we discuss some general features of hps models and present our version of an @xmath103 model @xcite .",
    "there are a number of substantial improvements in our version with respect to ma in ref .",
    "first , the hrs matrix is exactly obtained in a first approximation when higher dimensional operators are neglected , without imposing ad hoc relations among parameters ( in ref .",
    "the equality of @xmath104 and @xmath105 is not guaranteed by the symmetry ) .",
    "the observed hierarchy of charged lepton masses is obtained by assuming a larger flavour symmetry .",
    "the crucial issue of the required vev alignment in the scalar sector is considered with special attention and a natural solution of this problem was presented .",
    "we also keep the flavour scalar fields distinct from the normal higgs bosons ( a proliferation of higgs doublets is disfavoured by coupling unification ) and singlets under the standard model gauge group .",
    "last not least , we study the corrections from higher dimensionality operators allowed by the symmetries of the model and discuss the conditions on the cut - off scales and the vevs in order for these corrections to be completely under control .",
    "in ref . @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we show that if we want to reproduce @xmath122 in some limit of our theory , necessarily this limit can not correspond to an exact symmetry in flavour space ( we explicitly exclude symmetries that are broken by o(1 ) terms , for example such that the difference between the @xmath45 and the @xmath46 masses is a breaking effect or is introduced by hand while the symmetry would prescribe them of the same order ) .",
    "then a maximal atmospheric mixing angle can only originate from breaking effects as a solution of a vacuum alignment problem .",
    "our model is based on the discrete group @xmath103 following refs @xcite , where its structure and representations are described in detail .",
    "here we simply recall that @xmath103 is the discrete symmetry group of the rotations that leave a tethraedron invariant , or the group of the even permutations of 4 objects .",
    "it has 12 elements and 4 inequivalent irreducible representations denoted 1 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and 3 in terms of their respective dimensions . introducing @xmath125 , the cubic root of unity , @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 , the three one - dimensional representations are obtained by dividing the 12 elements of @xmath103 in three classes , which are determined by the multiplication rule , and assigning to ( class 1 , class 2 , class 3 ) a factor @xmath128 for 1 , or @xmath129 for @xmath123 or @xmath130 for @xmath124 .",
    "the product of two 3 gives @xmath131 .",
    "also @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 etc . for @xmath135 , @xmath136",
    "the irreducible representations obtained from their product are : @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 following ref .",
    "@xcite we assigns leptons to the four inequivalent representations of @xmath103 : left - handed lepton doublets @xmath142 transform as a triplet @xmath143 , while the right - handed charged leptons @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 transform as @xmath147 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "the flavour symmetry is broken by two real triplets @xmath148 and @xmath149 and by a real singlet @xmath150 . at variance with the choice made by @xcite , these fields are gauge singlets .",
    "hence we only need two higgs doublets @xmath151 ( not three generations of them as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which we take invariant under @xmath103 .",

    "such a mechanism only works in the case of discrete symmetries , since in the continuous case the large symmetry of the total potential energy would make the relative orientations of the two scalar sectors undetermined .    last but not least , the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses can be reproduced by the usual froggatt - nielsen mechanism within the context of an abelian flavour symmetry , which turns out to be fully compatible with the present scheme .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extensively discussed how this lowest order picture is modified by the introduction of higher dimensional operators .",
    "the induced corrections are parametrically small , of second order in the expansion parameter @xmath214 , @xmath153 being the cut - off of the theory , and they can be made numerically negligible .",
    "we believe that , from a purely technical point of view , we have fulfilled our goal to realize a completely natural construction of the hps mixing scheme . but to construct our model we had to introduce a number of special dynamical tricks ( like a peculiar set of discrete symmetries in extra dimensions ) .",
    "apparently this is the price to pay for a `` special '' model where all mixing angles are fixed to particular values .",
    "perhaps this exercise can be taken as a hint that it is more plausible to expect that , in the end , experiment will select a `` normal '' model with @xmath1 not too small and @xmath0 not too close to maximal .    0.2 cm",
