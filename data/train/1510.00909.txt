    "however , the proof of @xcite can not be straightforwardly extended to the general family of inequalities ( [ 0009 ] ) .",
    "of course , a natural question , whose answer can be useful in other inequalities , is whether the upper estimates @xmath12 can be improved as long as the exponent @xmath27 moves from the left to the right in ( [ 87 ] ) . in this paper , among other results we show that for the multiple exponent @xmath28 the sharp constants are still @xmath29 it is worth mentioning that our approach seems to be not effective to cover all the remaining cases @xmath30 and this some open problems remain waiting for an answer .",
    "the exact values for the optimal constants @xmath31 satisfying ( [ ul ] ) are still unknown , although many progresses have been made in the last few years . having nice estimates for these constants is , in general , crucial for applications ( for instance in quantum information theory ( see @xcite ) , and complex analysis @xcite ) . the first estimates for @xmath32 ( @xcite ) suggested an exponential growth but only few years ago very different results have appeared . in fact , for @xmath33 the most recent estimates for the optimal values for the constants satisfying ( [ ul ] ) show a sublinear growth:@xmath34more specifically , for complex scalars ( see @xcite ) , @xmath35where @xmath36 denotes the gamma function . for real scalars ( see @xcite),@xmath37where the constants @xmath38 denote the best constants satisfying khinchine s inequality ( see @xcite ) , which are given by @xmath39for @xmath40 and    @xmath41    for @xmath42 more precisely , the number @xmath43 @xmath44 is the solution of the following equality    @xmath45    it is still an open problem , for real scalars , if the optimal constants @xmath46 are @xmath47 or @xmath48 or whether they lie strictly between these bounds",
