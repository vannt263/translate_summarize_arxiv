    "one of the most important resources for quantum information processing is entanglement .",
    "entangled states and many of its applications do not have any classical counterpart , and thus , an entangled state essentially reveals and exploits nonclassicality ( quantumness ) present in a physical system .",
    "for example , entanglement is essential ( may not be sufficient ) for dense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite and device independent quantum cryptography @xcite ; and none of these schemes ( i.e. , dense coding , teleportation , device independent quantum cryptography ) has any classical analog . among these nonclassical schemes , teleportation deserves special attention , as a large number of quantum communication schemes can be viewed as variants of teleportation .",
    "for example , quantum information splitting ( qis ) @xcite , hierarchical qis ( hqis ) @xcite , quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite , quantum cryptography based on entanglement swapping @xcite may be viewed as variants of teleportation .",
    "usually , standard entangled states , which are inseparable states of orthogonal states , are used to implement these teleportation based schemes .",
    "however , entangled non - orthogonal states do exist and they may be used to implement some of these teleportation - based protocols @xcite .",
    "specifically , entangled coherent states @xcite and schrodinger cat states prepared using @xmath0 coherent states @xcite are the typical examples of entangled non - orthogonal states .",
    "such a state was first introduced by sanders in 1992 @xcite . since",
    "then several investigations have been made on the properties and applications of the entangled non - orthogonal states .",
    "the investigations have yielded a hand full of interesting results . to be precise , in ref .",
    "@xcite , prakash et al . , have provided an interesting scheme for entanglement swapping for a pair of entangled coherent states ; subsequently , they investigated the effect of noise on the teleportation fidelity obtained in their scheme @xcite , and dong et al .",
    "@xcite , showed that this type of entanglement swapping schemes can be used to construct a scheme for continuous variable quantum key distribution ( qkd ) ; the work of hirota et al .",
    "@xcite , has established that entangled coherent states , which constitute one of the most popular examples of the entangled non - orthogonal states , are more robust against decoherence due to photon absorption in comparison to the conventional bi - photon bell states ; another variant of entangled non - orthogonal states known as squeezed quasi bell state has recently been found to be very useful for quantum phase estimation @xcite ; in @xcite , adhikari et al . , have investigated the merits and demerits of an entangled non - orthogonal state - based teleportation scheme analogous to the standard teleportation scheme . in brief , these interesting works have established that most of the quantum computing and communication tasks that can be performed using usual entangled states of orthogonal states can also be performed using entangled non - orthogonal states .",
    "the concept of masfi , which was claimed to corresponds to the least value of possible fidelity for any given information , was introduced by prakash et al .",
    "subsequently , in a series of papers ( @xcite and references therein ) , they have reported masfi for various protocols of quantum communication , and specially for the imperfect teleportation . here , it is important to note that adhikari et al .",
    "@xcite , tried to extend the domain of the standard teleportation protocol to the case of performing teleportation using entangled non - orthogonal states . to be precise , they studied teleportation of an unknown quantum state by using a specific type of entangled non - orthogonal state as the quantum channel . in their protocol",
    ", the input state to be teleported from alice to bob was prepared by a third party charlie , who used to send the prepared state to alice though a noiseless quantum channel .",
    "clearly , the presence of charlie was not essential , and in the absence of charlie , their scheme can be viewed simply as a scheme for teleportation using non - orthogonal state .",
    "interestingly , they s d that the amount of non - orthogonality present in the quantum channel affects the average fidelity ( @xmath1 ) of teleportation .",
    "however , their work was restricted to a specific type of entangled non - orthogonal state ( a specific type of quasi bell state ) , and neither the optimality of the scheme nor the effect of noise on it was investigated by them .",
    "in fact , in their work no effort had been made to perform a comparative study ( in terms of different measures of teleportation quality ) among possible quasi bell states that can be used as teleportation channel .",
    "further , the works of prakash et al . , @xcite and others ( @xcite and references therein ) have established that in addition to @xmath2 minimum assured fidelity ( masfi ) and minimum average fidelity ( mavfi ) , which we refer here as minimum fidelity ( mfi ) can be used as measures of quality of teleportation .    keeping these points in mind , in the present paper",
    ", we have studied the effect of the amount of non - orthogonality on @xmath1 , mfi , and masfi for teleportation of a qubit using different quasi bell states , which can be used as the quantum channel .",
    "we have compared the performance of these quasi bell states as teleportation channel an ideal situation ( i.e. , in the absence of noise ) and in the presence of various types of noise ( e.g. , amplitude damping ( ad ) and phase damping ( pd ) ) .",
    "the relevance of the choice of these noise models has been well established in the past ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "further , using hordecky et al.s relation @xcite between optimal fidelity ( @xmath3 ) and maximal singlet fraction ( @xmath4 ) , it is established that the entangled non - orthogonal state based teleportation scheme investigated in the present work , is optimal for all the cases studied here ( i.e. , for all the quasi bell states ) .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entangled - non - orthngooal - states ] , we briefly describe the mathematical structure of the entangled non - orthogonal states and how to quantify the amount of entanglement present in such states using concurrence . in this section , we have restricted ourselves to very short description as most of the expressions reported here are well known .",

    "the main results of the present paper are reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantum - teleportation - using ] , where we provide expressions for @xmath5 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 for all the four quasi - bell states and establish @xmath6 for all the quasi bell states , and deterministic perfect teleportation is possible with the help of quasi - bell states . in sec .",

    "these states of the subsystems satisfy @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the conventional entangled states of orthogonal states and they satisfy @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the entangled nonorthogonal states .",

    "( [ eq:5 ] ) shows that an arbitrary entangled non - orthogonal state can be considered as a state of two logical qubits .",

    "this is already noted in table 1 , where we have also noted that if we express @xmath67 in @xmath97 basis , we obtain the bell state @xmath98 , which is maximally entangled and naturally yields unit fidelity for teleportation .",

    "thus , we may conclude that the quasi bell state @xmath58 will never lead to deterministic perfect teleportation .",

    "interestingly , @xmath115 is found to depend on the parameters of the state to be teleported ( cf .",
    "( 11 ) of ref .",
    "thus , if we use bloch representation and express the state to be teleported as @xmath116 , then the teleportation fidelity @xmath115 will be a function of state parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( here @xmath119 is used to distinguish the state parameter @xmath117 from the non - orthogonality parameter @xmath51 ) .",
    "an average fidelity is obtained by taking average over all possible states that can be teleported , i.e. , by computing @xmath120 .",
    "this definition of average fidelity is followed in @xcite and in the present paper . however , in the works of prakash et al .",

    "as that notation is not consistent with the definition of average fidelity used here . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to the minimum value of @xmath115 as mfi , but it would be the same as mavfi defined by prakash et al .",
    "further , we would like to note that in @xcite and in the present paper , it is assumed that a standard teleportation scheme is implemented by replacing a bell state by its partner quasi bell state , and as a consequence for a specific outcome of bell measurement of alice , bob applies the same pauli operator for teleportation channel @xmath122 or @xmath123 ( which is a quasi bell state ) as he used to do for the corresponding bell state @xmath124 or @xmath125 where @xmath126 however , the expression of masfi used here ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) ) and derived in @xcite are obtained using an optimized set of unitary ( cf .",
    "discussion after eq .",
    "( 10 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and are subjected to outcome of bell measurement of alice , thus no conclusions should be made by comparing masfi with mfi or @xmath1 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) and ( [ eq:15 ] ) , we can see that for a standard bell state @xmath57 ( i.e. , when @xmath90 ) , @xmath127 .",
    "however , for @xmath87 = 1 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "thus , we conclude that for a standard bell state both @xmath5 and average teleportation fidelity have the same value .",
    "this is not surprising , as for @xmath87= 0 the entangled state @xmath58 becomes maximally entangled .",
    "however , for @xmath91 this state is non - maximally entangled , and interestingly , for @xmath87= 1 , we obtain @xmath130 , whereas @xmath1 is nonzero .",
    "we have already noted that no comparison of @xmath5 and @xmath1 obtained as above should be made as that may lead to confusing results .",
    "here we give an example , according to @xcite , masfi is the least possible value of the fidelity , but for certain values of @xmath87 , we can observe that @xmath131 for example , for @xmath132 , we obtain @xmath133 whereas @xmath134 clearly , minimum found in computation of @xmath5 , and the average found in the computation of @xmath1 is not performed over the same data set , specifically not using the same teleportation mechanism ( same unitary operations at the receiver s end ) .",
    "now we may check the optimality of the teleportation scheme by using the criterion introduced by horodecki et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this criterion optimal average fidelity that can be obtained for a teleportation schme which uses a bipartite entangled quantum state @xmath135 as the quantum channel is @xmath136 where @xmath4 is the maximal singlet fraction defined as @xmath137 where @xmath112 : @xmath138 is bell state described above and summarized in table [ tab : quasi - bell - states ] . as we are interested in computing @xmath4 for quasi bell states which are pure states , we can write @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a quasi bell state .",
    "a bit of calculation yields that maximal singlet fraction for the quasi bell state @xmath58 is @xmath141 now using ( [ eq:15 ] ) , ( [ eq : horodecki ] ) and ( [ eq : singlerfracpsiplus ] ) , we can easily observe that @xmath142 thus , a quasi bell state based teleportation scheme which is analogous to the usual teleportation scheme , but uses a quasi bell state @xmath58 as the quantum channel is optimal .",
    "we can also minimize @xmath143 with respect to @xmath117 and @xmath118 to obtain @xmath144 which is incidentally equivalent to maximal singlet fraction in this case .",
    "so far we have reported analytic expressions for some parameters ( e.g. , @xmath2 @xmath145 and @xmath146 that can be used as measures of the quality of a teleportation scheme realized using the teleportation channel @xmath58 and have shown that the teleportation scheme obtained using @xmath58 is optimal . among these analytic expressions , @xmath147 was already reported in @xcite .",
    "now , to perform a comparative study , let us consider that the teleportation is performed using one of the remaining two quasi bell states of our interest ( i.e. , using @xmath148 or @xmath62 described in table [ tab : quasi - bell - states ] ) as quantum channel . in that case , we would obtain the concurrence as    @xmath149    clearly , in contrast to @xmath150 which was only @xmath87 dependent , the concurrence @xmath151 depends on both the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath51 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) it is clear that at @xmath152 @xmath153 quasi bell state @xmath148 @xmath154 is maximally entangled , even though the states @xmath21 and @xmath23 are non - orthogonal as @xmath155 .",
    "thus , at these points , states @xmath156 are maximally entangled .",
    "if quantum state @xmath148 is used as quantum channel , then @xmath5 for teleportation of an arbitrary single qubit information state ( [ eq:8 ] ) would be    @xmath157    and similarly , that for quasi bell state @xmath62 would be    @xmath158    thus , the expressions for @xmath5 are also found to depend on both @xmath87 and @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , at @xmath159 and @xmath160 @xmath161 , and hence for these particular choices of @xmath162 entangled non - orthogonal state @xmath148 leads to the deterministic perfect teleportation of single qubit information state .",
    "clearly , for these values of @xmath51 , @xmath163 indicating maximal entanglement . however , the entangled state is still non - orthogonal as @xmath87 can take any of its allowed values .",

    "thus , deterministic perfect teleportation is possible using quasi bell states @xmath67 or @xmath156 as quantum channels for teleportation , but it is not possible with @xmath58 unless it reduces to its orthogonal state counter part ( i.e. , @xmath167 we may now compute the average fidelity for @xmath156 , by using the procedure adopted above for @xmath58 and obtain @xmath168    ( color online ) the dependence of the average fidelity on non - orthogonality parameters is established via 2 and 3 dimensional plots .",
    "specifically , variation with @xmath87 for different values of @xmath169 and @xmath170 is shown in ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , ( d ) shows 3 dimensional variation for both @xmath171 and @xmath172 in light ( yellow ) and dark ( blue ) colored surface plots .",

    "note that the quantity plotted in this and the following figures is @xmath1 , which is mentioned as @xmath173 in the @xmath174-axis . ]",
    "now , we would like to compare the average fidelity expressions obtained so far for various values of non - orthogonality parameters for all the quasi bell states .",
    "the same is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : avfid ] .",
    "specifically , in fig .",
    "[ fig : avfid ] ( a)-(c ) we have shown the dependence of average fidelity on secondary non - orthogonality parameter ( @xmath51 ) using a set of plots for its variation with primary non - orthogonality parameter ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this establishes that the primary non - orthogonality parameter has more control over the obtained average , fidelity but a secondary parameter is also prominent enough to change the choice of quasi bell state to be preferred for specific value of primary non - orthogonality parameter .",
    "thus , the amount of non - orthogonality plays a crucial role in deciding which quasi bell state would provide highest average fidelity for a teleportation scheme implemented using quasi bell state as the teleportation channel .",
    "further , all these plots also establish that there is always a quasi bell state apart from @xmath67 , which has average fidelity more than classically achievable fidelity @xmath175 for all values of @xmath87 .",
    "we may now further illustrate the dependence of the average fidelity on both non - orthogonality parameters via 3 d and contour plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avfid ] ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) . these plots",
    "establish that the average fidelity of @xmath148 state increases for the values of @xmath51 for which @xmath62 decreases , and vice - versa .",
    "we can now establish the optimality of the teleportation scheme implemented using @xmath156 by computing average fidelity and maximal singlet fraction for these channels .",
    "specifically , computing the maximal singlet fraction using the standard procedure described above , we have obtained    @xmath176    using hordecky et al . , criterion ( [ eq : horodecki ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : avefidelityphipm])-([eq : singlet fractionphipm ] ) , we can easily verify that @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the teleportation scheme realized using any of the quasi bell state are optimal .",
    "however , they are not equally efficient for a specific choice of non - orthogonality parameter as we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : avfid ] .",
    "this motivates us to further compare the performances of these quasi bell states as a potential quantum channel for teleportation .",
    "for the completeness of the comparative investigation of the teleportation efficiencies of different quasi bell states here we would also like to report mfi that can be achieved using different quasi bell states .",
    "the same can be computed as above , and the computation leads to following analytic expressions of mfi for @xmath156 : @xmath178 and @xmath179    interestingly , the comparative analysis performed with the expressions of mfi using their variation with various parameters led to quite similar behavior as observed for @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : avfid ] .",
    "therefore , we are not reporting corresponding figures obtained for mfi .",
    "in this section , we would like to analyze and compare the average fidelity obtained for each quasi bell state over two well known markovian channels , i.e. , ad and pd channels . specifically , in open quantum system formalism , a quantum state evolving under a noisy channel can be written in terms of kraus operators as follows @xcite @xmath180 where @xmath181s are the kraus operators of a specific noise model .",

    "( [ eq : kraus - damping ] ) and ( [ eq : kraus - dephasing ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise - affected - density - matrix-1 ] ) . finally , to quantify the effect of noise we use a distance based measure `` fidelity '' between the quantum state evolved under a specific noisy channel and the quantum state alice wish to teleport ( say @xmath185 ) .",

    "further , details of the mathematical technique adopted here can be found in some of our recent works on secure @xcite and insecure quantum communication @xcite .",
    "we will start with the simplest case , where we assume that only bob s part of the quantum channel is subjected to either ad or pd noise .",
    "the assumption is justified as the quasi bell state used as quantum channel is prepared locally ( here assumed to be prepared by alice ) and shared afterwards . during alice to bob transmission of an entnagled qubit , it may undergo decoherence , but the probability of decoherence is much less for the other qubits that do nt travel through the channel ( remain with alice ) .",
