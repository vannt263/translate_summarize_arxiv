    "type ia supernova ( sn ) is a thermonuclear explosion of a c+o white dwarf in a close binary ( see , * ? ? ?",

    "* for a review ) .",
    "when the mass of the white dwarf becomes close to the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath8 ) , the explosion is triggered .",
    "thus , the ejecta mass of type ia sne is always similar @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the observed properties of type ia sne are more homogeneous than those of core - collapse sne , which have various ejecta masses .",
    "thanks to this homogeneity , type ia sne are used as a cosmological distance indicator .",
    "although it is known that the maximum luminosity has a diversity , this can be corrected using the shape of the light curve : the brighter sne decline more slowly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recently , the discovery of a class of extremely luminous type ia sne has casted the question on the progenitor scenario .",
    "@xcite reported that sn 2003fg had a maximum brightness @xmath9 mag .",
    "to power such an extreme luminosity , @xmath10 of @xmath6ni  is required . despite the large @xmath6ni  production , the expansion velocity of sn 2003fg ( @xmath11 km  s@xmath12  near the maximum brightness ) is slower than normal type ia sne ( @xmath13 km  s@xmath12 ) . from these facts",
    ", they suggested that the progenitor of sn 2003fg has a super - chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "another candidate of super - chandrasekhar mass type ia sn is sn 2006gz @xcite .",
    "the maximum brightness is @xmath15 mag when the host extinction @xmath16 mag is assumed .",

    "this class of objects commonly shows clear lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "the c lines are rarely seen in normal type ia sne @xcite .",
    "the presence of c also seems to support a super - chandrasekhar mass progenitor since it suggests that there is a lot of unburned elements above the thick @xmath6ni - rich layer .",
    "the c - rich ejecta might also explain the faintness of sn 2006gz at late phases @xcite .",
    "however , there is a possibility that this class of objects is an aspherical explosion of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .",
    "@xcite discussed the difficulty in synthesizing much @xmath6ni  in a differentially rotating white dwarf , and suggested an aspherical , lopsided explosion of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .",
    "@xcite argued that a combination of the low velocity and the moderate light curve decline rate of sn 2003fg is not compatible with super - chandrasekhar mass explosion , although the observed properties of sn 2006gz are consistent with a spherical explosion of a super - chandrasekhar mass progenitor .",
    "they also suggested possible asphericity , if those two overluminous sne are to be explained in a unified scenario .",
    "asphericity must be one of the keys to understanding the nature of the extremely luminous type ia sne .",
    "asphericity of extragalactic sne can be studied by polarization measurements ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "polarization is generated by the electron scattering in the sn ejecta .",
    "when a photon is scattered by an electron with nearly @xmath17 , unpolarized light gains large linear polarization , whose vector direction is orthogonal to the scattering plane .",
    "since extragalactic sne are point sources , the polarization vectors are cancelled out in spherically symmetric ejecta .",
    "thus , if polarization is detected , it undoubtedly means asymmetry of the sn ejecta @xcite . the larger degree of polarization means larger deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "past observations show that the continuum polarization of normal type ia sne is small , being @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "thus , the explosion of normal type ia sne is almost spherical .",
    "in addition , polarization at the line has information on element distribution .",
    "scattering by lines tends to depolarize lights @xcite .",
    "if the line scattering elements are distributed aspherically , the cancellation of polarization vectors becomes incomplete at the absorption minimum of the p cygni profile . as a result , enhancement of the polarization degree is detected at the absorption . in other words , detection of the line polarization",
    "directly means that the distribution of the elements is not uniform in front of the photosphere .",
    "although spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool , it was not performed for the three candidates of super - chandrasekhar mass type ia sn so far . in this paper , we present the first spectropolarimetric observation of a candidate of super - chandrasekhar mass type ia sn : sn 2009dc .",
    "sn 2009dc was discovered by @xcite in s0 galaxy ugc 10064 .",
    "@xcite performed the first spectroscopy and reported the slow expansion velocity and the presence of the line .",
    "@xcite performed infrared spectroscopy and reported non - detection of lines .",
    "@xcite showed that sn 2009dc is an extremely luminous event .",
    "if the distance modulus @xmath19 mag and galactic extinction @xmath20 mag @xcite are assumed , the peak absolute magnitude is @xmath21 mag ( even assuming null extinction in the host galaxy ) .",
    "this is twice as bright as the average luminosity of type ia sne . the required mass of @xmath6ni  is estimated to be @xmath7",
    "thus , sn 2009dc belongs to the same class as sne 2003fg and 2006gz : the fourth candidate of super - chandrasekhar mass type ia sn . for the properties of sn 2009dc ,",

    "the data taken from @xcite are plotted in blue points in figure [ fig : pdm15 ] .",
    "the time evolution is not corrected for . with two exceptions ( sne 2004dt and 1999by )",
    ", they suggested that the brighter sne ( with smaller @xmath104 ) show the smaller line polarization .",
    "@xcite limited their sample to the data taken at premaximum phases . from the literatures , we have added three spectropolarimetric examples at postmaximum phases ( green points in figure [ fig : pdm15 ] ) : sn 1997dt ( + 21 days , @xmath108 , @xcite ) , sn 2003du ( + 18 days , @xmath109 , @xcite ) , and sn 2004s ( + 4 days , @xmath110 , @xcite ) .",
    "their @xmath104 is @xmath111 mag @xcite , @xmath112 mag @xcite , and @xmath113 mag @xcite , respectively",
    ". we must be careful about the time evolution of polarization .",
    "it is thought that the degree of polarization decreases with time @xcite , but the number of multi - epoch spectropolarimetric observations is not sufficient to clarify the common property of the time evolution .",
    "keeping this caveat in mind , we can still see the trend that brighter sne have smaller line polarization . as is inferred from spectral models for type ia sne @xcite",
    ", brigher sne have the thinner si - rich layers , i.e. , the degree of the line polarization is smaller in sne with the thinner si - rich layers . in addition , sne with high si ii line velocities tend to have a high si ii line polarization @xcite . in high - velocity sne ,",
    "the si - rich layer is thought to be thick @xcite .",
    "we thus suggest that the si line polarization can be used as an indicator of thickness of the si - rich layers , or that enough thick si - rich layers are required to produce the sufficient line polarization .",
    "sn 2009dc is an extremely luminous sn , synthesizing @xmath7 of @xmath6ni(@xmath114 mag , @xcite ) . despite the large production of @xmath6ni",
    ", we have detected a moderate degree of line polarization .",
    "the degree of the si line polarization ( @xmath4 , red point in figure [ fig : pdm15 ] ) is higher than expected from the trend seen in other type ia sne ( blue and green points ) .",
    "this fact suggests that sn 2009dc has enough thick , clumpy si - rich layers above @xmath7 of @xmath6ni - rich layers .",
    "it must be cautioned , however , that this discussion relies largely on the small number of spectropolarimetry of sn 1991t - like overluminous type ia sn , especially on sn 2001v ( @xcite , see @xcite for spectroscopic behavior ) . to firm the conclusion , more spectropolarimetric observations of sne with @xmath115 mag are necessary .",
    "we have shown that sn 2009dc shows the small continuum polarization and moderate line polarizations . from the relation between @xmath104 and the line polarization ,",
    "it is suggested that sn 2009dc has enough thick , clumpy si - rich layers .",
    "combined with the low line velocities and the clear detection of the strong line @xcite , we suggest that sn 2009dc has a super - chandrasekhar mass .",
    "@xcite suggested a possibility that the extremely luminous type ia sn 2003fg is an aspherical explosion of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf . in their scenario ,",
    "the explosion is triggered at an off - center position , and nuclear burning preferentially takes place toward one direction . as a result",
    ", the distribution of @xmath6ni  is lopsided .",
    "with such a lopsided explosion , the extreme luminosity can be explained even with 0.9 @xmath116 of @xmath6niwhen we observe the sn from the @xmath6ni - rich direction .",
    "although this explosion model is very aspherical , the expected continuum polarization may not be very large .",
    "@xcite presented theoretical predictions of the polarization spectra for a detonating failed deflagration model by @xcite , in which the off - center ignition is followed by a surface detonation .",
    "the center of the @xmath6ni  distribution is displaced also in this model .",
    "the resultant sn can be brighter when it is viewed from the direction in which the detonation takes place .",
    "the predicted continuum polarization is small in every line of sight .",
    "this is understood as following . in the ellipsoidal geometry ,",
    "non - zero polarization is expected because of the difference in the amount of light from the pole and the equator ( 90-degrees away ) , having orthogonal polarization directions . in the off - center model ,",
    "on the other hand , the difference is mainly in 180-degrees away , and thus , the resultant net polarization is small .",
    "it is also worth comparing the line polarization of this off - center ignition model @xcite with the observation ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "although the expected polarization depends on the line of sight , @xcite found that the line polarization tends to be high , reflecting the aspherical distribution of intermediate mass elements . in there",
    "model , the line polarization is greater than 1 @xmath118 in almost half of the possible viewing angles .",
    "next , we discuss explosion geometry of a super - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .",
    "when a super - chandrasekhar mass is maintained by rapid rotation , the rotation speed is limited by the critical rotation at the surface in the equatorial direction .",
    "if the rotation is uniform , the chandrasekhar mass is only 1.5 @xmath116 .",
    "if the white dwarf mass is as large as 2 @xmath116 , then the rotation must be differential and the white dwarf prior to the explosion has an aspherical shape @xcite .",
    "the explosion of super - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf was first studied by @xcite .",
    "they explored pure detonation models and found that almost all the materials are burned into fe - peak elements .",
    "this is incompatible with the observed properties of normal and extremely luminous type ia sne .",
    "recently , @xcite performed simulations of deflagration models of super - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .",
    "they found that the deflagration model does not result in a bright enough sn , and is unlikely to explain the extremely luminous type ia sne , as noted by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite revised the simulations of pure detonation models of super - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .",
    "they found that the entire white dwarf is not burned into fe - peak elements , and that some intermediate mass elements are synthesized . in their models ,",
    "the synthesized mass of @xmath6ni  is sufficiently large ( @xmath119 ) to explain the extremely luminous type ia sne .",
    "it is worth testing the spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric properties of this model .",
    "note that a recently proposed scenario involving the collision of two white dwarfs could also realize super - chandrasekhar mass ejecta @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario predicts a very aspherical explosion , and thus , it may not be consistent with the small continuum polarization level observed in sn 2009dc .",
    "we have presented the first spectropolarimetric observations of a candidate of the super - chandrasekhar mass type ia sn : sn 2009dc . with the data taken at a later epoch",
    ", isp is estimated with small uncertainty .",
    "we find that the continuum polarization of sn 2009dc is small ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the degree of line polarization is moderate ( @xmath4 at @xmath476355 , and @xmath5 at the ir triplet ) .",
    "these properties of polarization are similar to those of normally luminous type ia sne with normal expansion velocities .",
    "the polarization at the and lines is detected not only at photospheric velocity ( @xmath120 km  s@xmath12 ) but also at high velocity ( @xmath101 km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "in addition , polarization data clearly show a loop in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane , suggesting non - axisymmetric , clumpy distribution of intermediate - mass elements .",
    "past spectropolarimetric observations of type ia sne show the trend that brighter sne have smaller line polarization @xcite .",
    "however , the degree of line polarization of sn 2009dc deviates from this trend : it is larger than expected from its extreme brightness .",
    "this fact suggests that there are thick enough , clumpy si - rich layers above the thick @xmath6ni - rich layers ( @xmath7 ) , and thus , the progenitor white dwarf has a super - chandrasekhar mass .    in summary , our spectropolarimetric observations ,",
    "combined with photometric and spectroscopic observations @xcite , suggest that sn 2009dc is an explosion of a super - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .",
    "the explosion geometry is globally spherically symmetric , with clumpy distribution of intermediate - mass elements .",
