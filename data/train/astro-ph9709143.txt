    "recent results from reverberation - mapping of the broad emission - line regions ( blr ) in agn indicate that the blr distance from the central radiation source roughly scales as @xmath3 ( koratkar & gaskell 1991;kaspi et.al .",
    "1996 ; peterson 1995 ) .",
    "our model provides a physical explanation to this scaling , and predicts an additional testable dependence on the spectral shape .",
    "most workers today agree that the line width in agn is induced by keplerian bulk motions .",
    "if this is the case , the blr distance is directly related to the line width , and studying such relations could provide more observational input .",
    "such an input seems to be found in a new class of narrow - line x - ray galaxies ( nlxg ) , which are similar to seyfert 1 galaxies except for having relatively narrow permitted lines ( fwhm @xmath4km / sec ) , and often stronger feii emission ( e.g. walter and fink 1993 ) .",
    "many nlxg show steep soft x - ray spectra , @xmath5 , while ordinary ( broad line ) agn such as seyfert 1 s and quasars usually have @xmath6 .",
    "mixed samples ( nlxg and ordinary agn ) show a strong correlation between the h@xmath2 line width and the soft x - ray spectral index ( boller , brandt and fink 1996 ; wang , brinkmann and bergeron 1996 , hereafter wbb ) .",
    "the latter authors found the soft x - ray spectral index is correlated also with the feii / h@xmath2 ratio , and with the h@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "we derive simple analytic relations between soft x - ray continuum spectrum ( luminosity and spectral index ) and the blr size and the width of the broad emission lines , which explain the observed correlation between the x - ray slope and the line width ( section 2 ) . applying the model to samples of agn it gives a good agreement with the blr sizes determined by reverberation mapping , and with the observed fwhm(h@xmath2 ) - cf .",
    "wandel and boller 1997b ( section 3 ) .",
    "finally , in section 4 we suggest explanations of two additional empirical correlations ( related to the h@xmath2 equivalent width and the feii emission ) and discuss the validity of our basic assumptions .",
    "while there is probably a range of physical conditions ( ionization parameter and density etc . ) in the broad hbeta line - emitting gas in agns , the emission of each line is dominated by emission in a relatively narrow optimum range of conditions ( baldwin et al .",
    "we will therefore make the assumption that the conditions relevant for h@xmath2 can be approximated by a single value .",
    "we show that within the observational constraints on the far uv and soft x - ray bands of agn spectra , the blr size and the line width predicted by the model are not very sensitive to the detailed shape of the spectrum in the euv band .",
    "we then estimate the blr size , and assuming keplerian velocity dispersion we relate it to the line width .",
    "the new element in our scheme is the use of the soft x - ray spectral index and luminosity to estimate the ionizing spectrum .",
    "the spectral index enters in the model as follows : a softer ( that is steeper ) spectrum has a stronger ionizing power , and hence the blr is formed at a larger distance from the central source , has a smaller velocity dispersion and produces narrower emission lines .",
    "we parametrize the form of the ionizing euv continuum in terms of the the break between the uv and x - ray bands and the measured soft x - ray slope @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the spatial extent of the blr may be represented by a characteristic size - e.g. the radius at which the emission peaks .",
    "the physical conditions in the line - emitting gas are largely determined by the ionization parameter ( the ratio of ionizing photon density to the electron density , @xmath8 , e.g. netzer , 1990)@xmath9where the ionizing photon flux ( number of ionizing photons per unit time ) is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the luminosity per unit energy , and @xmath121 rydberg=13.6 ev . defining the ionizing luminosity , @xmath13 and",
    "the mean energy of an ionizing photon , @xmath14 , the blr radius ( expressed in light - days ) may be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the observed x - ray luminosity , @xmath18 is the mean photon energy in rydbergs , and @xmath19 .",
    "typical values in the gas emitting the high excitation broad lines are @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( e.g. rees , netzer and ferland , 1989 ) , so that @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
    "we consider two practical cases : broad band luminosity , ( for the rosat band ) @xmath24 and a monochromatic luminosity defined by @xmath25 at e=0.3kev .",
    "the two cases give quite different @xmath0 vs. @xmath7 curves , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the ionizing flux is dominated by the euv continuum in the 1 - 10 rydberg regime , where most of the ionizing photons are emitted . since the the continuum in this range",
    "can not be observed directly , we try to estimate it by extrapolation from the nearest observable energy bands .",
    "the far uv spectrum has been observed beyond the lyman limit , for about 100 quasars ( zheng et al , 1996 ) , to wavelengths of 600   , and for a handful luminous , high redshift quasars to wavelengths of 350 .",
    "the average spectrum has a slope of @xmath26 in the 1000 - 2000   band , and below 900   it steepens to @xmath27 . in the soft x - ray band",
    "the observed spectrum is often steeper than this ( especially in nlxgs , see hasinger 1993 ; walter and fink , 1993 , but compare laor 1997 ) .",
    "this indicated there may be a break or a turnover at some intermediate energy @xmath28 between 10 and 100ev ( cf .",
    "mathews and ferland 1987 ) .",
    "we assume that the soft x - ray spectrum can be extrapolated to lower energies down to some break energy @xmath29 , and below the break we take @xmath30 .",
    "for the hard x - rays ( @xmath31 ) we use the  universal \" @xmath32 power law , observed in most agn with a high energy cutoff at 100kev ( since the ionizing photon flux is dominated by the continuum near 1 ryd , the model is insensitive to the assumed hard x - ray spectrum ) . in summary , we approximate the ionizing continuum spectrum by a broken power law of the form @xmath33 where the break energy @xmath34 is a free parameter , @xmath35 is the break energy at the hard x - ray band , and @xmath36 is the high energy cutoff . in the calculations below we",
    "take @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "fig . 1 shows how the calculated blr size depends on the x - ray spectral index , on the shape of the euv spectrum ( parametrized by @xmath28 ) and on the normalization of the x - ray luminosity ( broad - band or monochromatic ) . while the dependence on @xmath7 is strong ( @xmath0 increases by a factor of 100 when @xmath7 increases from 0 to 4 ) , the dependence on the euv shape is quite weak ; changing @xmath28 in the relevant range ( 13.6 - 100ev ) changes @xmath0 by less than 30% ( for @xmath39 ) .",
    "as expected , we find that @xmath0 is almost independent of the hard x - ray parameters - @xmath35 and @xmath36 .      assuming that the line width is induced by keplerian motion in the gravitational potential of the central mass , the velocity dispersion corresponding to the full width at half maximum of the emission lines is given by @xmath40 where m is the mass of the central black hole and r the distance of the broad line region from the central source .",
    "( 1 ) gives @xmath41    in order to relate the unknown mass to the observed luminosity we assume that the central mass approximately scales with the luminosity ( dibai 1981 ; joly 1985 ; wandel and yahil 1985 ; wandel and mushotzky 1986 ) . in terms of the eddington ratio these authors find for large agn samples @xmath42 . within this distribution ,",
    "bright objects tend to have slightly larger l / m ratios than faint ones ( cf .",
    "koratkar and gaskell 1991 ) roughly @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "combining this with the correlation between the optical and the x - ray luminosities @xmath45 ( kriss 1988 ; mushotzky and wandel 1989 ) gives @xmath46    and with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the line - width may be related directly to the observed x - ray luminosity and spectral index :    @xmath47 where @xmath48 combines all the unknown parameters ; for the @xmath22 and @xmath49 stated above we have @xmath50 .",
    "we have compared the blr size calculated from the model with the distance from the central source obtained by reverberation mapping of the h@xmath2 line , for a sample of 10 agn for which reverberation and x - ray data were available ( fig 2 and table 1 ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the agreement _ actually improves _ by taking the x - ray spectral slope into account .    in the model calculations",
    "we have used the spectral index from the power - law fit to the rosat 0.1 - 2.4 kev band and @xmath29=1ryd , ( with the exception of ngc 3783 , for which we have used @xmath51 , see walter and fink , 1992 ; note also that ngc 4151 has an extended emission , warwick et.al .",
    "the horizontal error bars represent the combined error in the luminosity and in the spectral index . allowing for the uncertainty in @xmath52 ( represented by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) , the agreement is quite good : all the points lie well within these boundaries . in order to test the significance of our model",
    ", we have calculated the blr radii _ without _ taking into account the spectral dependence ( that is , assuming all objects have _ the same _ soft x - ray spectral slope , which we set to the sample average , @xmath7=1.45 ) .",
    "we find that the difference between blr size ( calculated using only the luminosity scaling ) and the reverberation size is significantly larger when the spectral dependence is not taken into account for three objects ( ngc4151 , pg0844 and ngc 3783 ) shown as gray dots in fig 2 .",
    "for the other objects the difference is small in both calculations .",
    "the statistical significance of each model is tested by the @xmath58 statistic , @xmath59 ^ 2 \\over \\sigma_i^2({\\rm obs})+ \\sigma_i^2({\\rm mod})}.\\ ] ] the variance of each object is taken as the sum of the squared standard deviations of the observed radius ( the error in the reverberation determination ) and the calculated radius ( the errors in the involved observables - @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath58 values obtained for the three models are @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding confidence levels @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of degrees of freedom ( here taken as 9 ) .",
    "for the three models we get @xmath67=0.0043 , 0.0091 and 0.0077 respectively .      equation ( 5 ) predicts an explicit relation between the velocity dispersion ( associated with the line width ) , the x - ray luminosity and the spectral index , namely a surface in the @xmath68 space . for a fixed value of @xmath23",
    "this gives a curve in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "figure 3 shows such curves of fwhm vs.@xmath7 for several values of the luminosity , @xmath70-@xmath71 ( cf . wandel and boller 1997 ) .",
    "overplotted are the data points - fwhm(h@xmath2 ) vs. @xmath7 for a sample of agn ( see below ) .",
    "the model seems to reproduce the distribution of the data very well , and in particular it explains the observed anticorrelation between the h@xmath2 line width and the soft x - ray spectral index .      in order to test the model prediction over the three dimensional @xmath72 space we compare the observed line width to the value calculated with eq .",
    "( 5 ) using the measured x - ray spectral index and luminosity for a sample consisting of 33 ordinary agn from walter and fink ( 1993 ) combined with 32 nlxgs ( boller , brandt and , fink 1996 ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "4a , the agreement is very good , and most of the objects fall well within the uncertainty strip of log fwhm(obs)=log v(mod)@xmath730.5 . fig .",
    "4b shows the same comparison when the spectral information is not taken into account ( but rather its sample average , @xmath74 ) : the correlation is significantly weeker .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the observed and calculated line widths is @xmath75 and 0.316 respectively .",
    "the t - test statistic for zero regression    @xmath76 gives for the two cases @xmath77 and 2.40 respectively , for which the confidence levels for zero correlation are @xmath78 and 0.01 respectively , and the dependent confidence level ( which measures the significance of the dependence on spectral index , after taking out the dependence on the luminosity ) is @xmath79 .",
    "one may try to understand also the other strong correlations found in the data in terms of our model .",
    "the h@xmath2 equivalent width is anti - correlated with the fwhm ( gaskell 1985 , wbb ) and with the soft x - ray spectral index ; agn with a steep soft x - ray spectrum have a lower ew(h@xmath2 ) than flat- spectrum agn . to see how our model can explain this",
    ", we recall that the equivalent width measures the fraction of the continuum flux reprocessed and emitted in the line .",
    "we have shown ( fig .",
    "1 ) that the blr distance from the central source increases with the spectral index .",
    "if the emission - line clouds are not pressure confined , it is reasonable that their sizes do not change significantly with the blr radius , hence if clouds are conserved , the solid angle covered by the clouds decreases with radius , which implies that the equivalent width decreases with increasing ( steepening ) spectral index , as observed .",
