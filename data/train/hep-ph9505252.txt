    "the non - abelian gauge nature of the standard model predicts , in addition to the trilinear @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings ( tgv s ) , quartic gauge boson couplings ( qc s ) .",
    "the strength of the couplings is set by the universal gauge couplings of the @xmath9 local gauge symmetry . in the standard model",
    "there are only three quartic couplings which necessarily involve at least two charged @xmath10 s ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . although the @xmath14 vertex is not present in the sm it is present at tree level via higgs exchange while the @xmath15 vertex is only produced at loop level in the standard model .",
    "the trilinear and quartic couplings probe different aspects of the weak interactions .",
    "the trilinear couplings test the non - abelian gauge structure where deviations from the sm can result from integrating out heavy particles in loops @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the quartic couplings can be regarded as a window on electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "recall that the longitudinal components of the @xmath10 and @xmath16 are goldstone bosons .",
    "the quartic couplings of gauge bosons therefore represent a connection to the scalar sector of the theory .",
    "the qc s would arise as a contact interaction manifestation of heavy particle exchange .",
    "it is quite possible that the quartic couplings deviate from their sm values while the tgv s do not .",
    "for example , the bess model is a non - linear realization of symmetry breaking where new structures not present at tree level appear in 4@xmath10 couplings@xcite .",
    "there are models with a heavy scalar singlet interacting with the higgs sector which do not affect the @xmath17 parameter nor the tgv s but do change the @xmath18 vertex @xcite .",
    "thus , if the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking does not reveal itself through the discovery of new particles such as the higgs boson , supersymmetric particles , or technipions it is quite possible that anomalous quartic couplings could be our first probes into this sector of the electroweak theory .    while considerable effort has been expended to study the trilinear couplings , the quartic couplings are only starting to receive much attention . in this contribution",
    "i review recent developments in the study of quartic couplings and attempt to summarize the current status of this subject . in the next section i describe the effective lagrangians relevant to qc s .",
    "i will then describe various processes that have been proposed to study quartic couplings using a wide variety of colliding particles : @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . in the final section",
    "i summarize these results and also add some comments as to where the subject can benefit from further work .",
    "the formalism of effective lagrangians provides a well - defined framework for investigating the physics of anomalous couplings and electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the infinite set of terms in @xmath19 can be organized in an energy expansion where at low energy only a finite number of terms will contribute to a given process . at higher energies more and more terms become important until the whole process breaks down at the scale of new physics .",
    "one focuses on the leading operators in the expansion .",
    "quartic operators can either be associated with trilinear couplings or can be genuinely quartic .",
    "the former type is described by : @xmath20 this operator generates @xmath21 couplings with strength @xmath22 in addition to @xmath8 couplings .",
    "these vertices are not likely to be particularly interesting as the parameter @xmath23 will already be constrained from other processes such as @xmath24 where the tgv contributes but the qc does not appear @xcite    we will restrict our discussion to the more interesting , genuinely quartic couplings .",
    "we concentrate on the lowest dimension operators that can contribute to a given vertex .",
    "we impose custodial @xmath9 , which is satisfied to high precision by the nearness of the @xmath17 parameter to unity , and @xmath25 for the operators involving photons .",
    "there are 2 ( equivalent ) parametrizations which have appeared in the literature",
    ". we will begin by describing these parametrizations .",
    "this parametrization was introduced by blanger and boudjema @xcite .",
    "there are only two dimension four operators .",
    "they do not involve photons since @xmath25 requires derivatives which would result in a higher dimension operator . imposing @xmath26 the two dimension four operators",
    "are given by : @xmath27   \\\\      { \\cal l}^c_4 & = & { 1\\over 4 } g_c g_w^2          ( \\vec{w}_\\mu \\cdot\\vec{w}^\\nu ) ( \\vec{w}^\\mu\\cdot\\vec{w}_\\nu)\\\\      & & \\to   g_c g_w^2 [ { 1\\over 2}(w_\\mu^+ w^{-\\mu } w_\\nu^+ w^{-\\nu}+w_\\mu^+ w^{+\\mu } w_\\nu^- w^{-\\nu } ) \\\\      & & \\qquad\\qquad + { 1\\over c_w^2 } w_\\mu^+ w^{-\\nu } z^\\mu z_\\nu          + { 1\\over{4c_w^2 } } z^\\mu z_\\mu z_\\nu z^\\nu ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these operators involve the maximum number of longitudinal modes .",
    "these are the most important manifestations of an alternative symmetry breaking scenario .",
    "note that the @xmath14 vertex does not appear in the sm and @xmath28 can not be probed via 3 boson production in @xmath0 .",
    "photons do not appear in these genuine qc s .",
    "the first operator can be thought of as parametrizing heavy neutral scalar exchange so that we can make the connection : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the strength of coupling in the @xmath10 system .",
    "heavy higgs exchange , at tree level in the sm , gives @xmath30 of order 1 . in this case",
    "@xmath31 corresponds to @xmath32  gev which would most likely be observed directly at a high energy collider invalidating this approach . on the other hand ,",
    "taking a higgs mass of 1  tev yields a contact term of strength @xmath33 .",
    "thus , to see the effect of a heavy scalar as a deviation to the qc requires very precise measurements .    for the case of scalar exchange @xmath34 . in the second operator the @xmath35 vertex corresponds to heavy charged scalar exchange so that we could associate it with a triplet of heavy scalars .",
    "a specific case of interest is when @xmath36 which could parametrize heavy vector particle exchange which might arise in theories like technicolour . in this case",
    "the @xmath37 couplings cancel and the net effect is a rescaling of the sm @xmath18 vertex .",
    "bounds on @xmath38 therefore determine the precision with which @xmath18 couplings could be measured .    to introduce photons we have to go to dimension 6 operators .",
    "we only consider these dim-6 operators since they result in the largest phase space and are therefore most likely to give the largest deviations .",
    "imposing @xmath26 and @xmath39 and restricting the phenomenological analysis to the @xmath40 and @xmath41 conserving operators with a maximum of two photons involves the @xmath42 and @xmath43 vertices described by the operators : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an @xmath9 triplet and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the @xmath25 and @xmath9 field strengths respectively .",
    "both operators have contributions from loops but the first can originate from heavy neutral scalar exchange while the second can arise from charged scalars . note that the @xmath9 gauge symmetry predicts that @xmath15 does not appear in the sm .",
    "the custodial symmetry imposed on these couplings means that , in leading order in @xmath48 , they contribute in the same way to the @xmath49 and to @xmath50 .",
    "there is an additional operator which gives a @xmath51 vertex @xcite : @xmath52    the parameter @xmath53 is an unknown `` new physics '' scale which is often taken to be @xmath54 .",
    "this is a little misleading as @xmath53 represents the scale of new physics which one might expect to be @xmath55  tev .",
    "one should keep this in mind when gauging the sensitivity of various experiments to the parameters @xmath56 . to facilitate the comparison of different processes i have taken @xmath57  tev , rescaling results where necessary .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 affect the value of @xmath60 and therefore contribute to the @xmath61 and @xmath62 parameters @xcite leading to the rather weak one - sigma constraints@xcite : @xmath63 there are no similar low energy constraints on @xmath64 .",
    "another widely used effective lagrangian is the chiral lagrangian .",
    "it assumes a heavy higgs boson using a non - linear realization of the goldstone bosons and assumes a custodial @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xmath65 ^ 2 \\\\ { \\cal l}_2 = { l_2\\over 16\\pi^2 } [ tr(d^\\mu \\sigma^\\dagger d_\\nu \\sigma)]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67  gev , and @xmath68 . in this approach",
    "@xmath69 would be the most important manifestation of alternative symmetry breaking scenarios in a higgsless world .",
    "the two approaches are not distinct so that @xmath69 is equivalent to @xmath70 with the mapping : @xmath71    typical models with goldstone bosons interacting with a scalar , isoscalar resonance like the higgs boson give @xmath72 @xcite . from precision measurements of the @xmath73 widths",
    "dawson and valencia obtained the weak bounds @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "imposing perturbative unitarity gives the rough constraints of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the genuine quartic couplings are presently not well constrained by experiment but are limited by perturbative unitarity .",
    "to facilate comparison of different processes i have presented results in terms of @xmath76 , rescaling results where necessary ( using @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "i have defined @xmath79 when @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , one can write down operators involving two photons in the chiral lagrangian@xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    for @xmath2 reactions , by making explicit the @xmath39 symmetry , gives the mapping : @xmath84",
    "in this section i survey the various processes that have been proposed to measure quartic couplings .        at an 500  gev @xmath0 collider",
    "the @xmath10 fusion process will be ineffective so that three gauge boson production may be a reasonable substitute for the measurement of quartic couplings . in the process @xmath86",
    "four @xmath10 quartic couplings do nt contribute so that vertices with at least two neutral vector bosons where one of the neutrals couples to the @xmath0 vertex are likely to be the best tested in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "for any model with @xmath9 , however , @xmath87 vertices are related to @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath9 also predicts a @xmath37 vertex which will contribute to @xmath88 .",
    "the event rates for reactions that meet this criteria are shown in table [ table1 ] for @xmath89  gev and assuming an integrated luminosity of l=10  fb@xmath90 .",
    "the approach used is to look for deviations in the cross sections from their standard model values @xcite .    .",

    "one of the most important problems in particle physics is the understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if the higgs boson is `` heavy '' and electroweak symmetry breaking is non - linearly realized then the quartic vertices will provide a window into ewsb .",
    "i have surveyed various processes that have been proposed to study quartic couplings . for dimension 4",
    "operators @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 rescattering in @xmath96 have been considered and for dimension 6 operators @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .    for the dimension 4",
    "operators it appears that the lhc will provide the most constraining measurements . however , is far from clear whether the lhc will be able to disentangle this sector of the weak interaction .",
    "it is possible , then , that precision measurements at high energy @xmath0 colliders through @xmath5 rescattering could be our first glimpse of a strongly interacting weak interaction .",
    "for the dimension 6 quartic couplings involving photons , @xmath2 collisions appear to be the best place to measure these couplings .",
    "they can be measured at least an order of magnitude more precisely than using 3-boson production in @xmath0 .",
    "measurements using gauge boson production in @xmath1 collisions are almost as precise as the @xmath2 processes .",
    "the study of quartic couplings are still in the preliminary stages .",
    "it would be useful for the purposes of comparing different processes that a consistent parametrization of the vertices be adopted and that the different processes be analysed in a consistent way .",
    "the most dramatic effect of qc s is when all vector bosons are longitudinal .",
    "therefore , an important next step is to include the decays of the @xmath10 s and @xmath16 s into fermions and their reconstruction .",
    "after all , it is the fermions which are observed not the gauge bosons themselves .",
    "this would enable more sophisticated polarization studies that would simulate the experimental separation of @xmath10 s and @xmath16 s and the separation of longitudinal and transverse gauge bosons .",
