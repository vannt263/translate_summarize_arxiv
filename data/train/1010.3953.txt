    "to develop new ability to separate and stretch biomolecules , such as nucleic acids and proteins , is very important in molecular biology and medical research for its applications in single molecule analysis and dna sequencing  @xcite . conventional way to determine the genetic information of a dna molecule relies on a series of cumbersome operations of subcloning and electrophoretic separation  @xcite .",
    "this current method reads the sequence of dna fragments of hundred base - pairs per time , which has become inadequate for individualized genetic studies  @xcite . to improve the efficiency of sequencing ,",
    "single - molecule sequencing methods have been developed recently  @xcite , in which the genetic information of individual dna molecules is scanned in a linear fashion .",
    "one of the key problems in these methods concerns the unfolding of dna molecules to increase the spatial resolution of scanning , as dna molecules are long polyelectrolyte ( pe ) chains that usually adopt the coiled conformation in a typical buffer . in the past decades",
    ", many techniques have been developed to stretch pe chains , including the utilization of optical tweezers  @xcite , fluid flows  @xcite , electric fields  @xcite , and other methods  @xcite . among these methods , stretching pe chains in electric fields has received considerable attention , as electrokinetics has become a viable microfluidic method for on - chip molecular analysis  @xcite .",
    "dna electrophoresis is usually performed in a sieving medium , such as a gel or a polymer solution  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "dna chains transform cyclically between an extended structure , with one end hooked onto obstacles in the medium , and a coiled structure when released from the obstacles  @xcite .",
    "if an alternating - current ( ac ) electric field of appropriate frequency is applied instead , the conformation of chain in a sieving medium can be maintained constantly in an elongated structure  @xcite . in a bulk buffer ,",
    "coiled dna chains have been demonstrated to be stretched in a strong direct - current ( dc ) electric field , through the mechanism of polarization  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is a drawback to this method : a strong dc field leads easily to electrolytic dissociation of water molecules  @xcite . to avoid this drawback ,",
    "a short - duration pulse or an ac electric field has been suggested , with the period shorter than the dissociation reaction time .",
    "moreover , the mean displacement of pe chains in an ac field is zero .",
    "this feature could be used to trap or to manipulate single dna molecules at some place to facilitate the detection of the sequence , particularly when it is integrated with a dielectrophoresis trapping mechanism  @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown that ac electric field can indeed stretch and orient dna chains in aqueous solutions at low ac frequency and the chain polarization is largely reduced while the frequency is elevated  @xcite . recently , wang et al",
    ".  demonstrated that the conformational transition of single pes possesses a hysteretic nature upon sweeping the frequency of ac electric field  @xcite .    without a solid medium to break the symmetry of the coil - stretch transitions ,",
    "a low - frequency ac field should stretch the dna repeatedly during every half - cycle , in a manner of a quasi - dc field .",
    "however , unlike dc stretching , the polarization and stretching dynamics now becomes important , as the molecule must be fully stretched within one half period .",
    "it is known that multivalent cations have dramatic effects on the properties and structures of dna molecules in aqueous solutions  @xcite .",
    "coiled dna chains can collapse into globule particles while the chain charge is neutralized by the condensed multivalent cations  @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown that a collapsed dna chain can be unfolded in dc electric fields if the field strength surpasses a threshold  @xcite .",
    "this threshold @xmath0 depends on the chain length @xmath1 , and the dependence has been studied recently by computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "the results suggested a power law - like relation @xmath2 and the electrophoretic mobility of chain depends strongly on whether the chain is unfolded or not .",
    "these studies provide a solid foundation to separate pe chains by length in free solutions , based upon the drastic mobility change when a chain is unfolded by an applied electric field  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent study in protein mass spectrometry showed that ac electrospray ionization ( esi ) yields an effective ionization without fragmenting molecules , with higher ionization efficiency than dc esi  @xcite .",
    "the ionization efficiency is a sensitive function of sample ph and molecular conformation .",
    "it is still unclear whether the higher efficiency is due to the increased local ph or the conformational change or both of the two effects .",
    "this present work constitutes a fundamental molecular dynamics study of how an ac field affects the conformation of a pe chain and the condensation of counterions , and how the field strength to unfold the chain varies with frequency , in order to give deep insight of the complicated behavior of pe solutions in ac fields .",

    "our system contains a single linear chain , modeled by a bead - spring chain model .",
    "the chain is composed of @xmath1 monomers .",
    "each monomer carries a negative unit charge @xmath3 and dissociates one monovalent counterion into the solution .",
    "the bond connection on the chain is modeled by the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential @xmath4where @xmath5 is the bond length between two neighboring monomers , @xmath6 the maximum extension , and @xmath7 the spring constant .",
    "the condensation of the pe chain is induced by adding ( 3:1)-salt into the system .",
    "the salt molecules dissociate into trivalent cations ( also called `` counterions '' ) and monovalent anions ( also called `` coions '' ) in the solution .",
    "all these particles , including monomers , counterions , and coions , are modeled as lennard - jones ( lj ) spheres , described by the potential @xmath8 & \\mbox{\\ , for $ r \\le \\sqrt[6]{2 } \\sigma \\ ; $ } \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{\\ , for $ r > \\sqrt[6]{2 } \\sigma \\ ; $ } \\end{array } \\right.\\]]where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the diameter and the hardness of the lj sphere , respectively , and @xmath11 is the distance between two particles . since the interaction between the monomers is purely repulsive , this setup corresponds to a good solvent condition .",
    "particles also interact with each other via coulomb interaction , which read as @xmath12where @xmath13 is the thermal energy and @xmath14 is the charge valence of the @xmath15th particle .",
    "the bjerrum length @xmath16 is the distance between two unit charges , at which the electrostatic energy is equal to the thermal energy , where @xmath17 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath18 is the relative dielectric constant of solvent .",
    "the solvent molecules are not modeled explicitly in the study .",
    "however , their effects are incorporated implicitly by the following three ways : ( 1 ) dielectric screening of charge by @xmath18 , ( 2 ) friction force , @xmath19 , due to particle moving through the solvent , ( 3 ) stochastic force , @xmath20 , owing to thermal collisions of solvent molecules .",
    "the equation of motion , also known as the langevin equation , thus reads as @xmath21where @xmath22 is the particle mass , @xmath23 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath24 is the conservative force . in this equation ,",
    "the temperature @xmath25 is controlled by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath26 .",
    "the system is placed in a periodic rectangular box .",
    "the ac field @xmath27 is a square wave applied in @xmath28-direction .",
    "the period of the square wave is @xmath29 and the field strength is @xmath30 .",
    "particle - particle particle - mesh ewald sum  @xcite is used to calculate coulomb interaction .",
    "we simulate aqueous pe solutions at room temperature ( @xmath31k ) and assume that all the particles have the same mass @xmath32 and lj parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we set @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the time unit .",
    "since @xmath39 is 7.1   for water , the length unit @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath40  .",
    "the time unit @xmath41 is about 1.5 ps if @xmath32 is taken to a typical monomer mass of the order 100 g / mol .",
    "this set of parameters can be used to model flexible pe chains in water , such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate .",
    "the dimension of our simulation box is @xmath42 and the chain length @xmath1 is @xmath43 .",
    "it yields the monomer concentration @xmath44 equal to @xmath45 , which is about 12 mm in real unit .",
    "this @xmath44 describes a dilute pe solution .",
    "the salt concentration @xmath46 is set to the equivalence point @xmath47 .",
    "it has been shown that at @xmath48 , the trivalent counterions form complexes with the chain , largely neutralizing the bare chain charge ; the chain collapses into a globule structure  @xcite . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are varied over a wide range of value to study their effects on the properties of the pe system .",
    "langevin equation is integrated by verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath49 equal to @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "a pre - run phase takes about @xmath51 time steps to bring the system into a stationary state for each ( @xmath29 , @xmath30)-case , followed by a production - run phase of @xmath52 time steps to cumulate data for analysis .",

    "for e.g. , the strength of electric field will be described in unit @xmath55 .",

    "the error bar of data , if not shown , is smaller than the symbol size of data in this paper . ]",
    "we can see that @xmath56 shows a sharp transition , occurred at @xmath60 .",
    "below @xmath61 , the pe chain stays in a collapsed state , in which condensed trivalent counterions tightly bind monomers together , resulting in a chain size similar to the unperturbed size in zero field .",
    "the structure of the collapsed chain is a spherical globule .",
    "when @xmath62 , the chain unfolds abruptly .",
    "the dc field is strong enough to drive the condensed trivalent counterions towards one side of the chain globule and even more , strips them off the chain .",
    "the chain is hence elongated and aligned in the field direction in the process .",
    "the degree of chain unfolding can be as large as @xmath63 of the contour length when @xmath59 is large enough .",
    "the detailed study including the effect of salt concentration and valence on chain unfolding as well as the scaling law for @xmath61 against @xmath1 in dc fields can be found in refs .",
    "an independent simulation done recently by other group  @xcite also confirms our results .",
    "we then studied the case with ac fields .",
    "the degree of chain unfolding is now plotted against the field period @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : p1n96_z3_et_ds_inflex.eps](b ) for different field strength @xmath30 .",
    "the results show that @xmath56 takes the value of zero field , @xmath64 , over the whole range of @xmath29 when @xmath65 .",
    "in this situation , the field strength is too weak to overcome the binding of the condensed trivalent counterions to unfold the chain .",
    "when @xmath66 , chain unfolding can take place and @xmath56 is a sigmoidal function of @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath29 is small , the applied field alters very frequently .",
    "the duration of a half period of the field , within which the square - wave field acts as a dc one pointing to either @xmath67 or @xmath68 direction , is not long enough either for the chain to complete its conformational change or for the condensed counterions to migrate to stable positions .",
    "the degree of chain unfolding is thus small .",
    "when @xmath29 is sufficiently large , the deformation and the polarization of the pe complex can be completed in a half period . the chain is unfolded and the maximal degree of chain unfolding takes a value corresponding to the limiting value in the referenced dc field . in the figure ,",
    "the limiting value has been indicated in dashed line .",
    "the reduction of the degree of chain unfolding in the region of small @xmath29 is in agreement with experiments  @xcite ; recent simulation  @xcite also reported a consistent behavior .",
    "moreover , we observed that the transition of @xmath56 is not really sharp but occurs over a range of period @xmath29 . in order to characterize this behavior quantitatively ,",
    "we define the transition point at @xmath69 , which is the inflection point of the @xmath56 curve .",
    "the inflection point has been indicated by a symbol ` x ' on each curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : p1n96_z3_et_ds_inflex.eps](b ) .",
    "we saw immediately that @xmath70 depends strongly on @xmath30 and the value falls in a range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , or equivalently , from 22.5 ps to 5.25 ns .",
    "therefore , the collapsed chain is unfolded when the ac field frequency is smaller than the order of tera- or giga - hertz .",
    "detailed study showing that @xmath70 is directly related to the characteristic time to fully polarize the pe chain will be presented later .",
    "since chain unfolding occurs in a small frequency region , experiments can verify this phenomenon easily , provided that the ac field strength is stronger than @xmath61 .",
    "as having been shown in our previous dc simulations  @xcite , @xmath61 can be largely reduced to a value of few hundreds volt per cm if a long pe chain of order , for e.g. , @xmath73 , is used .",
    "this strength of ac field is accessible by experiments .      in order to have the picture of chain conformation in mind",

    "the trivalent counterions , the monovalent counterions , and the coions are represented by the red , green and white beads , respectively .",
    "the change of the field direction is indicated on the left side of the figure as a function of field cycle @xmath77 and the evolution of the chain conformation can be seen in each panel , following the @xmath77-axis from bottom to top . ]",
    "three field periods are presented in the panels : ( a ) @xmath74 , ( b ) @xmath75 , and ( c ) @xmath76 , which are , respectively , smaller than , about equal to , and larger than the critical period @xmath70 ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : p1n96_z3_et_ds_inflex.eps ] ) . in each panel ,",
    "the evolution of chain shape against a field cycle is shown , following the @xmath77-axis .",
    "we can see that for the case of small period ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots](a ) ) , the chain is not unfolded in the ac field .",
    "it exhibits a globule structure .",
    "this is because the acting time in a half - cycle of the ac field is too short for the chain to response . on the other hand , for the case of large period as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots](c ) , the acting time is long enough .",
    "the chain is stretched and displays an elongated structure aligned parallel to the field direction .",
    "if we look carefully into the snapshots , we can find that the trivalent counterions are not uniformly condensed on the chain backbone in this case .",
    "they follow the field direction and accumulates more on one of the chain end .",
    "this non - uniform distribution results in a chain polarization .",
    "when the ac field switches its direction , the stability of the system is suddenly destroyed and the condensed trivalent ions migrate toward the other chain end .",
    "the chain partially shrinks and then regains its size soon after the new stability is established . for the case with the field period close to @xmath70 ( panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] ) , an astonishing , tadpole - like structure of chain is observed , just before switching of the ac field direction . the head of the tadpole structure is derived from the accumulated trivalent counterions binding together with the chain near an end . and",
    "the tail is formed by the other side of the chain with less counterions condensed on it . because the chain is partially unfolded",
    ", the degree of polarization is smaller than the one in panel ( c ) .",
    "the change of the ac field direction drives the trivalent counterions moving away from the tadpole head toward the tail . as a passage ,",
    "the head shrinks and the tail grows .",
    "eventually , the new accumulation of the trivalent counterions creates a new head on the other side of the chain .",
    "the new tadpole structure thus inverts its heading direction and waits for the next field alternating .",
    "the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath30 can be captured by the following charge relaxation theory .",
    "we assume that a pe chain is unfolded in an ac field if the polarization energy of the chain complex , @xmath78 , is larger than some critical energy , where @xmath79 is the field frequency and @xmath80 is the polarizability .",
    "this critical energy can be estimated by @xmath81 , the polarization energy to unfold the chain in the critical dc field @xmath61 .",
    "it is known that for a conducting maxwell - wagner sphere of arbitrary radius @xmath82 in an ac field , the polarizability can be expressed by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the clausius - mossotti factor , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the @xmath79-dependent complex permittivity of the solvent medium and the pe complex , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this clausius - mossotti factor arises due to both the dielectric polarization , resulting from the permittivity difference across the sphere - medium interface , and the space charge accumulation at the interface , derived from the conductivity gradient and the corresponding ion flux discontinuity at that location .",
    "while counterion migration occurs across the entire collapsed chain , charge polarization occurs only at the two poles .",
    "it involves the dissociation and condensation of the migrating counterions presented within a debye - layer neighborhood of the interface . as a result ,",
    "the dipole formation time is the usual charge relaxation time at the interface .",
    "when the resulting dipole moment aligns parallel to the electric field , a net stretching force is imposed on the chain , corresponding to the polarization energy .",
    "the chain is unfolded .",
    "the condensed ions hence play a role to the pe chain , similar to the one of the bound surface electrons to a dielectric object .",
    "therefore , the polarization dynamics of the system can be studied by the method of electrical impedance  @xcite .",
    "we model the dielectric response for the pe complex by a resistor - capacitor ( rc ) circuit in series .",
    "the complex permittivity reads as @xmath87 the response function for the solvent is modeled by a rc circuit in parallel and the complex permittivity is @xmath88 here @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) are , respectively , the permittivity and the ion conductivity in the pe complex ( or in the solvent ) , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 . since the trivalent counterions condensed quite tightly on the chain , the migration of these ions from one side of the pe complex to the other side in an electric field is similar to the electron migration from one plate of a capacitor to the other plate in a voltage source .",
    "the ion migration also suffers a resistance force against the applied electric field , a situation which is similar to put a resistor in the circuit .",
    "therefore , we model the pe chain phase by an rc circuit in series . because the length scale across the phase in the field direction corresponds to both the capacitor gap and the resistor length , the ratio @xmath95 is the characteristic time to move the counterions from one side of the pe chain to the other side .",
    "it corresponds to the rc time of the circuit . in the solvent phase",
    ", the ions travel through the whole system .",
    "since the traveling speed is not fast , the medium is a poor conductor for ions .",
    "therefore , we regard the solvent as a leaky dielectric , modeled by an rc circuit in parallel .",
    "a similar argument shows that the ratio @xmath96 is the rc time for the solvent .    due to the linear dependence of the conductivity on the ionic strength ,",
    "the rc time for solvent is also the charge relaxation time of electrolyte , which is equal to the squared debye screening length divided by the diffusivity of the dominant ions . for the pe phase ,",
    "this connection is typically not true because the ions conduct through nanoporous structures formed by the twisted chain in the phase , rather than simply through a bulk solution .",
    "the rc time for the pe phase is important in determination of the critical frequency . at high frequency",
    ", the chain polarization is due to dielectric polarization and the value is small . at low frequency ,",
    "the `` capacitor '' is fully charged through conductive polarization by accumulating counterions at one pole of the pe globule , producing a large polarization .",
    "this polarization can grow even further via chain unfolding if the applied electric field is strong .",
    "we assume that the rc time for pe is a constant at the critical points to unfold the chain .",
    "based upon the above assumption for the polarization energy , the critical frequency @xmath97 to unfold a chain is determined by the criterion @xmath98/{\\rm re}[k(\\omega_c)]$ ] .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath99 .",
    "we obtain @xmath100where @xmath101 is the excess of the squared electric field .",

    "the length unit @xmath9 and time unit @xmath41 are 2.4  and 1.5ps , respectively , while mapped to a real system .",
    "since the trivalent cations condense on the chain and largely neutralize the chain charge , most of the monovalent cations and anions are presented in the bulk solution . hence , the concentrations of the cations and the anions in the solution are both about 0.0001 ( @xmath109 ) , or equivalently , 12 mm .",
    "the permittivity of water in our system is @xmath110 using this value of @xmath111 ( @xmath112 in our unit system ) for @xmath91 , the theoretical interpretation of our coarse - grained simulation of chain stretching yields the solvent conductivity @xmath92 ( @xmath113 equal to @xmath114 , or equivalently , 0.59 s / m  @xcite .",

    "the wing bottom occurs at non - zero @xmath121 , showing that the variation of @xmath56 falls behind the @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the chain elongation is slaved to the fast dynamics of the interfacial trivalent counterion dissociation / relaxation time which dominates the polarization .",
    "moreover , a beautiful shuttlecock pattern is formed when the ensemble of the data at different field frequencies is looked together in the @xmath121-@xmath56 plot .      to quantify the findings with our theory , we calculated the polarization time by fitting exponentially the growth of @xmath121 in a half cycle of field with large @xmath29 . the mean polarization time",
    "@xmath128 versus the critical period @xmath70 to unfold the chain is shown in fig  [ fig : taup_t_e_inflex.eps](a ) .     vs.  critical period @xmath70 , and ( b ) @xmath128 vs.  field strength @xmath30 .",
    "in panel ( b ) , fluctuation time @xmath129 is also plotted as a function of @xmath130 at the same scale .",
    "the values of @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath70 are reported in unit @xmath49 . ]",
    "we found that @xmath128 depends linearly on @xmath70 with slope equal to 0.27(1 ) .",
    "this result interestingly connects the critical points with the polarization in the supercritical region where the chain is fully unfolded .",
    "the physics can be understood by the following simple picture .",
    "because the chain structure is linear in the supercritical region ( @xmath131 ) , the polarization time @xmath128 can be estimated by the relaxation time @xmath132 where @xmath82 is the relaxation distance of trivalent counterions migrating through the chain to establish a new polarization when the applied field switches the direction and @xmath133 is the drifting velocity equal to @xmath134 . in our simulations , @xmath135 for the trivalent counterions and @xmath136 for small @xmath97 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) . the slope 0.27 yields a relaxation distance of @xmath137 ( about @xmath138 of the chain contour length ) , which is a reasonable value in view of the profile of charge distribution along the chain . fig  [ fig : taup_t_e_inflex.eps](b ) shows @xmath128 as a function of the ac field strength @xmath30 .",
    "one can see that the stronger the field strength , the shorter the polarization time .",
    "it is because ions and pes are dragged at faster speeds when the applied field is stronger .",
    "moreover , detailed study showed that in the region of strong field @xmath139 , @xmath128 is inversely proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "also , in the limit where @xmath30 tends toward @xmath140 , the product of @xmath141 and @xmath142 is a constant .",
    "the two behaviors can be deduced easily from our theory , known that @xmath70 and @xmath128 are identical within a factor .",
    "our simulations are in good agreement with experiments of field - induced decondensation  @xcite , in which the reciprocal of the relaxation time of decondensation exhibits a linear relation to the field strength when the field is strong , and deviates from the relation when the field is weak .",
    "recently , simulations done by liu et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the intrinsic chain relaxation frequency is the upper bound of the critical ac frequency to stretch a pe chain .",
    "this bound is quite crude in light of the current result . to further verify the importance of the dissociation / condensation of the interfacial trivalent counterions , we calculated the autocorrelation function of @xmath56 , defined by @xmath143 in different dc electric fields",
    "the correlation time @xmath129 , calculated by fitting @xmath144 function exponentially , represents physically the fluctuation time of chain size under the action of a dc electric field .",
    "the results have been plotted in fig  [ fig : taup_t_e_inflex.eps](b ) as a function of the field strength @xmath59 at the same scale .",
    "we found that @xmath129 is a constant when @xmath145 .",
    "a large jump occurs at @xmath146 and then , @xmath129 decreases inversely with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "a striking finding is that @xmath129 is basically coincident with @xmath128 in the region @xmath147 .",
    "we know that the pe chain is in a dynamic equilibrium with the ions surrounding it .",
    "the dissociation or condensation of a counterion away or onto the chain will locally break the chain stability and cause the fluctuation of the chain size .",
    "the coincidence between these characteristic times shows the importance of the ion fluctuations on chain unfolding . the critical frequency to stretch a chain in a square - wave ac field",
    "is mainly determined by the dissociation / relaxation of the condensed interfacial trivalent counterions , which takes the value of the fluctuation time of chain size in the counterpart dc electric field .",
    "we have revealed the key conditions to unfold collapsed pe chains in square - wave ac electric fields : the field strength must be larger than the critical dc field to stretch the chain and the frequency is smaller than the inverse of the counterion dissociation / relaxation time under a quasi - dc field .",
    "moreover , when both conditions are satisfied , there is a strong correlation between the critical field strength and the field frequency .",
    "a simple scaling theory , based upon maxwell - wagner dielectric theory , can quantitatively capture this critical field - frequency correlation for pe unfolding in ac fields .",
