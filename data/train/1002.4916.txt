    "the relative strength of these two decays at moderate to large @xmath4 is controlled by the ratio @xmath91 ( note that in the flipped model the @xmath90 branching fraction inherits the large uncertainty in the strange quark mass ) .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath27 mode is in contrast to the type - ii 2hdm ; in that model decays to quarks dominate only at low @xmath92 where the charm quark yukawa coupling contributes significantly to the rate , leading to @xmath93 .",

    "the measured rate for @xmath22 yields a lower bound on @xmath3 which is almost independent of @xmath4 for @xmath112 ; for smaller values of @xmath4 the bound becomes stronger .",
    "because the allowed charged higgs contribution is quite small , the bound is very sensitive to the experimental central value and the theoretical calculation for the sm rate .",

    "the dominant decay for @xmath4 larger than a few is @xmath121 , leading to a signal in these channels of @xmath169 .",
    "we expect that this will be completely swamped by four - jet qcd backgrounds .",
    "charged higgs production in top quark decay has already proven to be a more sensitive channel at the tevatron and we expect that this will remain true at the lhc",
    ".    for charged higgs masses above the @xmath5 threshold , the signal in any of these channels will be @xmath170 .",
    "we expect that backgrounds will be dominated by @xmath1 just as in the case of the @xmath154 , @xmath151 channel discussed in the previous section ; at the same time the signal cross section is at least an order of magnitude smaller than for @xmath154 . unless the forward jets in the weak boson fusion process can be used to severely reduce the background , we thus expect that these channels will be even less sensitive than @xmath154 associated production .      finally , we consider associated production of a charged higgs boson with a @xmath11 , initiated by @xmath172 fusion at tree level or gluon fusion at one loop .",
    "these processes can proceed directly via @xmath81 couplings to an initial or internal fermion , as well as via @xmath142 coupling to an @xmath163-channel neutral higgs boson ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or @xmath73 ) .",
    "the leading - order cross sections were computed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the mssm higgs sector .",
    "squark loop contributions to the gluon - fusion process in the mssm were computed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and one - loop electroweak and qcd corrections to the @xmath172 fusion process were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . for @xmath164",
    "gev , ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath173 the @xmath172 fusion process is dominant , in part because of strong destructive interference between quark box and triangle diagrams in the gluon fusion process  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections in the flipped 2hdm are the same as those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same higgs spectrum and mixing angles , except for the absence of supersymmetric @xmath4-enhanced one - loop corrections to the bottom quark yukawa coupling .",
    "however , the mssm imposes stringent relations among the neutral and charged higgs masses which are absent in a generic 2hdm .",
    "reference  @xcite studied @xmath171 production at the lhc in a generic 2hdm and found that , compared to the mssm case , the cross section could be enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude in some parts of parameter space ( allowed by all theoretical and experimental constraints ) due to the lifting of destructive interference or resonant production of a heavier neutral higgs boson followed by decay to @xmath171 .",
    "reference  @xcite studied the lhc search prospects in this channel with @xmath174 and @xmath175 . in the context of an mssm - like higgs sector",
    ", the signal appears to be completely swamped by the large @xmath176 background ; however , in favorable non - mssm - like regions of 2hdm parameter space the cross section could be enhanced to an observable level  @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for a charged higgs boson would constitute conclusive proof of physics beyond the sm and shed light on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the simplest extensions of the sm that contain a charged higgs are two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "there are four possible assignments of the fermion couplings in two - higgs - doublet models that naturally avoid tree - level flavor - changing neutral higgs interactions .",
    "the phenomenology and lhc search prospects for the charged higgs boson in the type - i and -ii models have been studied extensively in the literature ; recent papers have done the same for the lepton - specific 2hdm .",
    "we complete the picture here by studying the charged higgs of the flipped 2hdm , in which one doublet gives mass to up - type quarks and charged leptons and the other gives mass to down - type quarks .",
    "the phenomenology of the charged higgs is controlled by the structure of the yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons , the charged higgs mass , and the parameter @xmath4 . in the flipped model ,",
    "the charged higgs couplings to quarks have the same @xmath4 dependence as in the usual type - ii model .",
    "this allowed us to carry over directly from the type - ii model those indirect constraints and charged higgs production cross sections that depend only on quark couplings .",
    "in contrast , the charged higgs couplings to leptons have the opposite @xmath4 dependence in the flipped model than in the type - ii model .",
    "this eliminates indirect constraints from ( semi-)leptonic meson decays and leads to a different pattern of charged higgs decays below the @xmath5 threshold compared to the type - ii model .",
    "we used these features to extract the existing indirect and direct constraints on the charged higgs in the flipped model and to evaluate the search prospects at the lhc .",
    "the strongest indirect constraint comes from @xmath22 , which yields @xmath177300  gev ; @xmath107@xmath108 mixing also constrains @xmath178 ( 1.3 , 0.9 ) for @xmath117 ( 200 , 300 )  gev .",
    "because indirect constraints are vulnerable to contributions from other unknown new physics , we also considered direct search constraints on the charged higgs from lep and the tevatron . taking account of the different decay patterns in the flipped model compared to the type - ii model , we found that the lep experiments yield @xmath179 gev while tevatron searches for @xmath6 put an upper bound on @xmath4 of about 40 for @xmath180  gev and exclude very small @xmath4 values below about 0.51.5 .",
    "it should be possible at the lhc to extend the tevatron s sensitivity in @xmath6 to more moderate @xmath4 values , but existing studies consider only the @xmath143 channel , which would provide sensitivity in the flipped model only at low @xmath4 .",
    "we expect that the lhc studies could be fruitfully extended to include @xmath137 as in the tevatron searches .    for charged higgs masses above the @xmath5 threshold",
    ", the only potentially promising discovery channel appears to be @xmath150 associated production with @xmath181 .",
    "signal rates in the flipped and type - ii models are essentially identical . unfortunately the most up - to - date atlas and cms studies of this channel with 30  fb@xmath153 conclude that the signal is obscured by the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath1 background .",
    "charged higgs searches thus remain a major challenge for the lhc .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "we compute the top quark branching fractions as follows . neglecting the bottom quark mass , the sm partial width for @xmath182",
    "is given at tree level by , @xmath183    \\left[1 - \\frac{m_w^2}{m_t^2 } \\right]^2.\\ ] ] taking @xmath184  gev and @xmath185  gev  @xcite yields @xmath186  gev .",
    "in the flipped and type - ii models , the partial width for @xmath6 is given at tree level by , @xmath187     \\left[1 - \\frac{m_{h^+}^2}{m_t^2 } \\right]^2,\\ ] ] where we again neglect the final - state bottom quark mass in the kinematics , but keep @xmath188 where it enters the charged higgs yukawa coupling .",
    "in particular , the decay width becomes large at both low and high @xmath4 .    at high @xmath4",
    "the @xmath139 coupling is dominated by the term proportional to @xmath189 .",
    "this coupling receives large qcd corrections , which can be mostly accounted for by using the running bottom quark mass evaluated at the energy scale of the process , which we take to be @xmath3 .",
    "we use the one - loop expression for the running bottom quark mass , @xmath190^{4/b_0 } \\bar m_b(m_b),\\ ] ] where @xmath191 and @xmath192 is the number of active quark flavors in the energy range of interest . here",
    "gev  @xcite is the running bottom quark mass in the modified minimal subtraction scheme evaluated at the bottom quark mass scale , and the running strong coupling @xmath194 is given at one loop by @xmath195 we use @xmath196  @xcite .",
