    "massive stars strongly disturb the interstellar medium ( ism ) via emission of ionizing photons , stellar winds , and supernova explosions .",
    "these processes produce overpressured hot bubbles that expand into ambient interstellar clouds . at the same time , a shock wave sweeps up the ambient clouds into a dense shell .",
    "the expanding shell strongly influences the dynamics of the ism .",
    "especially , it is often supposed to trigger the formation of stars through the gravitational fragmentation @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the dynamical expansion of the hii region , the photodissociation region , and the swept - up shell , solving the uv and far - uv radiative transfer and thermal and chemical processes in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamics code .",
    "they showed that the shell becomes cold and dense enough for the gravitational instability ( gi ) to take place owing to the reformation of molecules destructed by far - uv photons .",
    "numerous authors have discovered evidences for the star formation in shell - like molecular clouds around hot bubbles . @xcite",
    "have compiled a catalogue of @xmath0 shells from data in _ spitzer_-glimpse survey .",
    "recently , @xcite have investigated 102 samples identified as shells on the _",
    "spitzer_-glimpse images at 8.0@xmath1 m .",
    "they found that 86% of the shells are associated with ionized gases , or hii regions .",
    "they obtained statistical properties of the triggered star formation , and suggested that more than a quarter of the shells may have triggered the formation of massive stars .",
    "this suggests that the trigger star formation process may be important in the massive star formation .    to understand the triggered star formation",
    ", it is important to investigate how and when the expanding shell fragments through the gi . @xcite and @xcite derived a simple dispersion relation taking into account the mass accretion and the dilution effect of perturbations owing to the expansion .",
    "they assumed the thin - shell approximation , and neglect the boundary effect of the contact discontinuity ( cd ) .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) investigated stability of expanding shells taking into account asymmetric density profiles with imposing an approximate shock boundary condition on the leading surface and the cd boundary condition on the trailing surface .",
    "they found that the dispersion relation and eigen - function strongly depends on the boundary conditions and the degree of asymmetry of the density profile .",
    "although many authors have studied fragmentation of shells by using linear analysis , it is still uncertain how and when shells fragment .",
    "this is because the stability analysis of the evolving shell is difficult to perform without any approximations .",
    "therefore , time - dependent multi - dimensional simulations are crucial to investigate it .",
    "to resolve propagating thin shells all the time , the eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique in the mesh code or the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) have been used . however , since enormous meshes or sph particles are required to resolve the thickness , researches based on numerical simulations are less advanced .",
    "@xcite investigated the gravitational fragmentation of the shell driven by the expansion of the hii region by using three - dimensional ( 3d ) sph taking into account the radiative transfer of ionizing photons . in their simulation",
    ", its thickness was not resolved sufficiently .",
    "@xcite have investigated fragmentation of shells with fixed mass that expand into a hot rarefied gas by using two different numerical schemes , the eulerian amr method ( the flash code ) and the sph method .",
    "they considered shells confined by a constant pressure on both surfaces . in the more realistic situation where shells are confined by the cd and the shock front ( sf ) ,",
    "multi - dimensional simulations including the self - gravity have not been performed yet .    in this paper",
    ", we perform the 3d simulation to investigate the fragmentation process of expanding shells through gi . as numerical method",
    ", we adopt the 3d sph method . in order to attain high resolution enough to resolve the thickness ,",
    "we calculate not the whole but a part of the shell .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : simulations ] , we describe our model and simulations in detail .",
    "brief review of paper i is presented in section [ sec : review ] .",
    "the results of our simulations are shown in section [ sec : sph result ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : discuss ] and [ sec : summary ] , we present discussions and summaries of our paper .",
    "we adopt the sph method ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . since sph is lagrangian particle method",
    ", it is one of the best method for problems where a wide low density region and geometrically thin shell coexist . instead of additional viscosity to handle shocks",
    ", we use the `` godunov sph '' where the results of the riemann problem are used to calculate the interaction between sph particles @xcite . the tree method @xcite is used to calculate self - gravitational force .      in the standard sph method @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath2-th particle has the mass of @xmath3 , and its density is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is kernel function and we use the gaussian kernel , @xmath6 is the smoothing length , and @xmath7 is an average between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the equation of motion of the @xmath2-th particle is given by @xmath10 the standard sph has a shortcoming when calculating the cd between a hot and a cold gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the artificial tension stabilizes the kelvin - helmholtz instability with a different densities in the standard sph .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have shown that godunov sph can describe the kelvin - helmholtz instability reasonably well .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite proposed a new method that treats the cd naturally in the context of a multi - phase fluid .",
    "they modified equations ( [ eoc sph ] ) and ( [ eom sph ] ) to treat the cd as follows : @xmath11 and @xmath12\\nonumber\\\\          & & \\hspace{3cm}\\times\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial { \\bf x}_i }          w({\\bf x}_i - { \\bf x}_k .",

    "\\label{eom sph modi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term of @xmath13 represents the volume of @xmath2-th particle @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , if we determine particle mass of hot and cold gases so that its smoothing length distributes smoothly across the cd , the terms inside the bracket in equation ( [ eom sph modi ] ) is smooth across the cd , leading to much better behavior at the cd .",
    "their new method is very useful in problems where the position of the cd is known in advance as in our modeling .",
    "equation ( [ eom sph modi ] ) satisfies the relation of @xmath15 , suggesting that the momentum conservation is guaranteed .",
    "furthermore , we apply the godunov technique to equation ( [ eom sph modi ] ) as @xmath16\\nonumber\\\\          & & \\hspace{3cm}\\times\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial { \\bf x}_i }          w({\\bf x}_i - { \\bf x}_k ,          \\bar{h}_{ik } ) .          \\label{eom sph godunov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the result of the riemann problem between the @xmath2-th and the @xmath18-th particles @xcite .",
    "massive stars emit ultraviolet photons ( @xmath19 ev ) and produce hii regions around them . here",
    ", we consider a massive star that emits ionizing photons with the photon number luminosity @xmath20 $ ] into the ambient gas with the uniform density of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the number density and the mean mass of the ambient gas particle , respectively .",
    "we construct as simple model as possible to concentrate on the physics of gi of expanding shells .",
    "figure [ setup ] illustrates the schematic picture of our model . in this paper",
    ", we do not calculate the radiative transfer of ionizing photons but introduce hot and cold gases that are assumed to evolve keeping their temperatures constant .",
    "the hot gas is occupied in @xmath24 ( the dotted region ) , and the thin shell is in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positions of the cd and the sf , respectively .",
    "the pre - shock ambient cold gas in @xmath28 is assumed to be uniform . in our model ,",
    "the inner boundary is set at @xmath29 inside the hot bubble @xmath30 . in the hii region , the detailed balance between the recombination and the ionization is approximately established all the time .",
    "therefore , the interior pressure of the hii region is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the strmgren radius , @xmath33 we assume that the pressure of the hii region is spatially constant because of the high temperature .",
    "the hot gas at @xmath29 is pushed by the interior pressure @xmath34 .",
    "if we simulate the overall shell , the required number of sph particles , @xmath35 , is too large to calculate .",
    "therefore , to save @xmath35 , we calculate a part of the shell .",
    "the schematic picture of the calculation domain is shown in figure [ fig : region ] , and is designated by @xmath36 and @xmath37 . since the solid angle subtended by the calculation domain from the center @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the total number of sph particles can be reduced by a factor of @xmath40 compared with the calculation of the whole shell .          in this paper , for convenience , the units of the time , length , and mass scales are taken to be @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the dependence of the expansion law on the parameters @xmath46 are approximately eliminated by using the non - dimensional quantities normalized by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( see figure 1 in paper i ) .",
    "it is difficult to resolve very thin shell in early evolutionary phase even if we calculate the part of the shell ( see figure [ fig : region ] ) .",
    "thus , we use a grid - based 1d hydrodynamical code to describe the early evolutionary phase of the hii region expansion , and we switch to 3d sph at @xmath50 . as a grid - based numerical method",
    ", we use the 1d spherically symmetric lagrangian godunov method @xcite .",
    "the innermost mesh at @xmath51 is pushed by the interior pressure given by equation ( [ pext ] ) .",
    "when the 1d simulation reaches @xmath52 , the radial profiles of physical quantities are used as the initial condition of the 3d calculations .",
    "we smooth the distribution of the sound speed across the cd in the scale of the smoothing length .",
    "it is assumed that the temperature of the hot gas is 64 times as high as that of the cold gas .",
    "the specific value of the hot gas temperature does not change our conclusion as long as it is much larger than the temperature of the cold gas .",
    "we calculate the expansions of hii regions around the 41@xmath53 ( the high - mass ( hm ) model ) and 19@xmath54 ( the low - mass ( lm ) model ) stars that are embedded by the uniform ambient gas of @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "simulation parameters are listed in table [ table : model para ] .",
    "the temperature of the cold gas @xmath57 is assumed to be @xmath58 k. the opening angles of simulation domains are set to @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the hm and the lm models , respectively , so that the calculation domains contain a single wavelength of the most unstable mode predicted from the thin - shell linear analysis by @xcite .",
    "the mass of sph particles are set so that the initial thickness is resolved by five sph particles .",
    "since the thickness increases with time , the relative resolution becomes better as the shell expands . in the later phase",
    ", the thickness is resolved by @xmath61 particles .",
    "the total number of sph particles for the hm and the lm models are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "corrugation - type perturbations are put into the shell at the initial state .",
    "we displace the sph particles so that their densities do not change , or @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the displacement of the @xmath2-th particle .",
    "the functional form of the displacement of the shell is assumed to be @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the shell has the negative displacement at @xmath68 .",
    "the sph particles are displaced keeping their velocity , the sound speed , and the mass fixed .",

    "after that , the information in the whole solid angle can be obtained . however , for @xmath83 , the rotated domains in the @xmath81-direction have overlaps .",
    "this comes from the fact that the pyramid can not fill 3d space .",
