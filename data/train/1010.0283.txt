    "the reaction tank was a large glass cylinder sealed at each end by large rubber bungs .",

    "the outside end of the capillary tube was sealed with a short plastic tube clamped at one end which formed the initiation volume .",
    "the plastic tube was filled by a porous plug made of loosely packed cotton .",
    "reactions were initiated by inserting a thin hypodermic needle into the plastic tube and then injecting a very small amount of product solution into the porous plug .",
    "the purpose of the plug was to to quench any potential hydrodynamic disturbance of the quiescent reactant solution during reaction initiation .",
    "as a reaction front ascends , it must first make its way through the plug , and then into the capillary tube . upon reaching the end of the submerged portion of the capillary tube",
    ", a reaction front is then able to escape into the large volume of reactant solution , launching a plume .",
    "the apparatus was illuminated from behind and still images of the evolving plume were captured using a digital camera .",

    "congo red changes color over a ph range of 3.0 to 5.0 , where the acid form is blue and the base form is red .",
    "the reaction front leaves in its wake a product solution with ph of @xmath4 , so that the upwelling blue products are easily visible within the red unreacted solution .",
    "in addition to the reactants , most solutions also contained chemically inert glycerol , the effect of which was to vary the fluid properties of the reactant mixtures , which are given in table  [ fluprops ] . unless otherwise stated , glycerol concentrations throughout this paper are given in volume percent .",

    "the various stages in the evolution of a plume that pinches - off were first described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in summary , these stages are as follows . in the initial stage",
    "the plume creeps slowly out of the capillary tube and its head remains roughly spherical . following this stage ,",
    "the plume head changes shape and the vortical motion within the head becomes visible as the product solution wraps within an overturning vortex ring . as the plume head continues to ascend and enlarge , it begins to pinch - off from the upwelling conduit . during this stage of growth ,",
    "the head becomes almost completely detached from the conduit , and becomes an essentially free vortex ring . beneath this vortex ring , a rising bulge in the conduit forms which eventually becomes a second generation plume head .",
    "multiple generations of plume heads can be formed through this pinch - off process .",
    "whether or not an autocatalytic plume head pinches - off , and also the number of pinch - offs , depends on the fluid properties of the reactant solution .",
    "[ morph ] shows the morphologies of fully developed starting plumes produced in solutions with various concentrations of glycerol .",
    "plumes produced in the solutions without glycerol , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ morph]a , did not exhibit pinch - off .",
    "similarly , in 20% glycerol solutions pinch - off was not observed .",
    "all plumes that did exhibit pinch - off , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ morph]c - e , generally had similar morphologies , regardless of the number of times that pinch - off occurred .",
    "for experiments in 30% and 40% glycerol , there were always two or more pinch - offs . at glycerol concentrations of 50% , however , pinch - off was rarely observed . in cases where it did happen , such as the run shown in fig .",
    "[ morph]e , only a single pinch - off event took place .",
    "in addition to fluid properties , the number of pinch - offs observed for a given reactant solution composition also depended on the length of the cylinder in which experiments were performed . in the 32 cm high cylinder , the maximum number of fully developed plume heads produced was four .",
    "this occurred for a run in a 30% glycerol solution . to test whether or not the number of pinch - offs could be increased by giving plumes more vertical space to develop , experimental runs were performed in an apparatus with the same diameter as the 32 cm long cylinder , but with a length of 40.6 cm .",
    "these runs were only performed for glycerol concentrations of 20% , 40% , and 50% . for 50% glycerol plumes ,",
    "no additional plume heads were generated .",
    "however , for 20% glycerol plumes , extending the length allowed for a single pinch - off to occur , when , in contrast , no pinch - offs were observed in the shorter cylinder for the same solution .",
    "the maximum number of fully developed heads for a 40% glycerol run in the longer cylinder was five , compared to just three heads in the shorter cylinder .",
    "the ascent data for five plume heads produced in a 40% glycerol solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ five_heads ] .     for each plume head.,height=245 ]      for each experimental run , the ascent velocity of each plume head was calculated using linear fits to the head height as a function of time .",
    "the maximum head velocity @xmath13 was determined from the fit to the five consecutive data points giving the largest slope . from @xmath13 , the head reynolds number , @xmath14 was calculated , where @xmath15 is the width of the plume head at the average time over which @xmath13 was measured .",
    "@xmath15 was measured from digital images , taking into account the optical magnification due to the cylindrical shape of the reaction tank .",
    "we observed that re@xmath16 had similar values for all of the plume heads produced in a given run .",
    "the exception to this generality was the value of re@xmath16 for the final head produced in a run with multiple heads , which was always somewhat less than the others .",
    "this was mainly due to the smaller value of its @xmath13 .",
    "typically , for a given experimental run , the final plume head would develop close to the top of the tank , giving it less time to accelerate before it hit the top surface of the fluid .",
    "this limitation is enhanced by the growing mass of product solution at the top of the tank which further decreases the vertical space into which the final head can ascend .",
    "for all of our experiments , re@xmath16 never exceeded @xmath17 .",
    "this value was reached in a 20% glycerol run , where @xmath18  cm , @xmath19  cm / s , and the kinematic viscosity of the solution was @xmath20  @xmath21/s .",
    "the value of re@xmath16 indicates that while the flow around the plume head is certainly laminar , re@xmath16 is not so small that it can be considered stokes or  creeping \" flow , which would require re@xmath22 .",
    "to understand the general tendency of the plumes to pinch - off , we examined the trend in the number of pinch - offs and head reynolds numbers for varying glycerol concentration .",
    "the glycerol concentration is conveniently expressed in terms of the dimensionless schmidt number , @xmath23 recall that the glycerol concentration effects both the kinematic viscosity @xmath6 and the molecular diffusivity of the iodide autocatalyst @xmath7 .",

    "as discussed above , the last head often did not have the time to fully develop before interacting with the top of the tank . @xmath24",
    "values from different runs were then averaged to obtain a characteristic reynolds number @xmath25 for all experiments that took place in fluids with same glycerol concentration and hence the same value of sc .",

    "[ morph ] .    for the two smallest schmidt numbers , corresponding to runs in 0% and 20% glycerol",
    ", @xmath25 is approximately independent of sc and no pinch - offs were observed .",
    "this reflects the rather small and undeveloped head morphology under these conditions . as fig .",
    "[ morph]a shows , in pure water , the head remains small and compact . in 20% glycerol ,",
    "a vortex ring develops in the head only near the top of the tank .",
    "while these plumes rise faster than plumes in solutions containing more glycerol , @xmath25 is limited by the small size of @xmath15 . as glycerol concentration increases , sc increases and",
    "@xmath25 begins to drop . in this regime ,",
    "multiple pinch - offs are observed .",
    "this behavior is accompanied by a decrease in @xmath25 with viscosity with only small changes in @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "finally , at the highest value of sc , only one pinch - off is observed while @xmath25 continues its downward trend .",
    "thus , we find that multiple pinch - off behavior occurs in a special , intermediate range of sc .",
    "plume heads reach maximum velocity because as the head grows in width , the flow field begins to have stronger viscous interactions with the cylindrical wall of the tank .",
    "as the head reaches widths comparable to the diameter of the cylinder , vortical fluid motion in the head appears to quench because of wall effects . eventually , the constrained vortical motion is no longer able to effectively entrain fresh reactant solution into the head , slowing the growth of buoyancy generated by the reaction . in the intermediate range of sc ,",
    "the plume rises slowly enough that a complex head morphology and multiple pinch - off events have time to develop . for the highest value of sc ,",
    "however , the increased constraint from boundary effects is likely the reason why pinch - off is seldom observed .     for autocatalytic plumes in a 30% ( dark circles , blue online ) and 40% ( light circles , orange online ) glycerol solution .",
    "the horizontal grey line indicates the constant value of @xmath26 for non - reacting forced plumes  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath27 corresponds approximately to when a vortex ring first forms in the head , not to the moment when the reaction front emerges from the capillary tube.,height=245 ]      in addition to the head width @xmath15 , the head length @xmath28 , was also measured from digital images .",
    "we defined @xmath28 as the distance from the top of the head to the base of the underturning lobe beneath it .",
    "the dimensionless aspect ratio @xmath29 is a useful way to compare autocatalytic plume heads to buoyant plume heads produced without chemical reactions  @xcite . for laminar forced plumes , the growing plume heads are self - similar and",
    "this ratio is constant  @xcite with @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , autocatalytic plume heads do not remain self - similar .",
    "[ wlchem ] shows that the aspect ratio of the autocatalytic plume head increases with time .",
    "a steep increase in the rate of change of @xmath29 occurs at approximately the same time that a narrowing of the conduit beneath the head becomes obvious , indicating that a pinch - off event is under way .",
    "another interesting feature of autocatalytic plume head morphology is the spherical shape of the top of the head , which we refer to as the _ crest_. the inset of fig .",
    "[ curve_time ] shows an image of a 40% glycerol plume head with a circle fitted to the crest shape .",
    "positions extracted from the image using edge detection were corrected for the optical distortion of the cylindrical tank and then fit to a circle to extract the radius of curvature @xmath30 .",
    "this analysis is similar to the method employed in a classic study of the shape of bubbles rising in a cylinder by davies and taylor  @xcite .",
    "the growth of @xmath30 with time for a 40% glycerol plume is shown in fig .",
    "[ curve_time ] .",
    "we find that @xmath30 goes through two distinct periods of linear growth .",
    "this is in contrast to the growth of the head width @xmath15 , which has been shown in previous work to have three distinct growth regimes  @xcite . while the transition from a small head without vortical motion to one with a vortex ring marks a change in growth rate of the width",
    ", it does not cause a change in the growth rate of the crest curvature @xmath30 .",
    "instead , the only transition observed in the growth rate of @xmath30 occurs after the head pinches - off from the conduit and becomes an almost - free vortex ring .",
    "a steep increase in growth rate of @xmath30 is a very clear and unambiguous morphological indicator of pinch - off .     of the crest of an autocatalytic plume head as a function of time .",
    "the two straight lines are fits to the data before and after pinch - off .",
    "the inset shows the crest of an autocatalytic plume head and the best fit circle that describes its shape .",
    "the head was imaged at a height of 16.7 cm above the outlet , 448 s after the front emerged from the capillary.,height=245 ]",
    "in this section , we turn to a discussion of the axisymmetric numerical simulation which was used to diagnose the processes leading up to pinch - off in autocatalytic plumes . while it was computationally intractable to use our numerical model to simulate fully realistic plumes with multiple pinch - off events , it was possible to use our model to gain insight into the main features of the process .      to describe our numerical model , it is helpful to first focus on the various dimensionless groups which control the fluid mechanical , thermal , and chemical aspects of plume dynamics .",
    "plume motion depends on three different diffusivities .",
    "the most rapidly diffusing quantity is the momentum , which scales with the kinematic viscosity @xmath6 .",
    "the reaction front is exothermic , and the diffusion of heat scales with the thermal diffusivity @xmath31 . finally , the concentration of the autocatalyst is the slowest diffusing quantity , scaling with the diffusivity @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the schmidt number @xmath32 , defined in eqn .  [ schmidt ] , a second independent dimensionless ratio is the lewis number , @xmath33 the prandtl number , given by @xmath34 is not required in our formulation , but naturally appears in discussions of purely thermal plumes  @xcite .    for a 40% glycerol solution , using @xmath35  @xmath21/s and values from table  [ fluprops ] ,",
    "we find @xmath36 the large values of @xmath32 and @xmath37 indicate that momentum and heat diffuse much faster than chemical concentration , and hence the concentration profile at the reaction front is extremely sharp compared to all the other fields that surround an autocatalytic plume .",
    "in general , the wide range of sc , le and pr indicate strong scale separation between the various effects .",

    "this suggests that the interior flow profiles of autocatalytic and non - reacting laminar plumes might be similar , at least initially .",
    "the simulation results , however , show that this is not the case .",
    "a non - reacting laminar plume head is formed by buoyancy flux from its upwelling plume conduit . in order to feed the head ,",

    "the plume head can not detach from the conduit . as the head rises",
    ", it must force its way up through quiescent fluid , and this induces large scale return flow in the tank .",
    "once this flow has been established below the plume head , fluid rising in the conduit experiences less resistance to motion than was initially experienced by the head  the conduit is moving upwards into fluid that already has momentum in the direction of its motion .",
    "this leads to the formation of a steady - state conduit flow below the plume head , where the velocity profile across a horizontal cross section of the conduit is constant , independent of height  @xcite .",
    "the simulation results show that the transient phase during the development of the autocatalytic steady - state conduit is much more complex than in non - reacting laminar plumes .",
    "previous experimental work  @xcite has shown that the conduit is conical , rather than cylindrical for the case of non - reacting laminar plumes .",
    "this shape is also clear in the simulated autocatalytic plume conduits .",
    "the most dramatic feature is of course the pinch - off process . in previous work",
    ", it was presumed that pinch - off occurs because of the acceleration of the autocatalytic plume head , which then leads to a `` bottleneck '' in the conduit at the site of pinch - off , resulting in the formation of a second generation head  @xcite .",
    "our simulation results reveal a much more complete picture of the flow development involved in this process .    as an autocatalytic plume evolves and the conduit elongates , reaction at the interface between reacted and unreacted fluids causes the buoyancy flux to be distributed along the entire length of the conduit . the time - dependent flow in the conduit is shown in fig .",
    "[ spacetime ] , which shows a space - time diagram of the vertical velocity profile along the axis of symmetry of the plume . in the early stages of plume growth , before about @xmath107 , the vertical velocity in the conduit increases with distance from the base of the plume .",
    "this shows that , even in the early stages , an autocatalytic plume conduit does not play the same role as a non - reacting plume conduit , which delivers buoyancy flux to the more slowly ascending non - reacting plume head .",
    "the ascent velocity of the autocatalytic plume head in the early regime exceeds the vertical velocity in the conduit , so that upwelling flow in the conduit does not reach the head .",
    "instead of being fed buoyant fluid by the conduit , an autocatalytic plume head is able to generate its own buoyancy flux by means of reaction with the surrounding fluid .",
    "the later stages of autocatalytic plume development , leading to pinch - off , are more complex . beyond approximately @xmath107 ,",
    "a velocity minimum becomes apparent beneath the head . in fig .",
    "[ spacetime ] , the minimum is seen as a streak that trails below the maximum near the crest of the plume .",
    "the development of the velocity minimum occurs long before morphological indicators of pinch - off are observed , namely , the changes in the growth rates of either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , or the visible narrowing of the conduit beneath the head .",
    "all of these indicators suggest that pinch - off occurs from anywhere between approximately @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "the first generation head continues to accelerate upward , despite the development of the velocity minimum , highlighting the lack of influence that the conduit has on the subsequent evolution of the first generation autocatalytic plume head .",
    "the second generation plume head is created by the accumulation of buoyant fluid rising up into the area of the velocity minimum .",
    "after it is formed , the second head also accelerates away from the conduit , and a new velocity minimum develops in its wake , bringing the process of head generation back to the beginning of the cycle .",
    "the simulation clearly shows the precursor structure in the conduit velocity that long precedes the morphological indicators of pinch - off . although it superficially resembles the conduit of a non - reacting plume , the structure below the head of an autocatalytic plume , which might better be called the  tail \" , does not contribute in the same way to plume head motion .",
    "this is already the case long before pinch - off becomes apparent .",
    "we have described an experimental and numerical study of buoyant laminar plumes driven by the autocatalytic iodate - arsenous acid reaction .",
    "experimentally , autocatalytic plumes were created in solutions where the viscosity was varied by the addition of glycerol . in the most viscous solutions , pinch - off of the plume head from the conduit",
    "was rarely observed , while in the lowest viscosity solutions , pinch - off was not observed . in the mid - range of glycerol concentrations used , however , pinch - off occurred multiple times from a single initiation event .",

    "we found that this ratio evolved with time quite differently from that of non - reacting forced plumes . a steep increase in the rate of change of @xmath30",
    "was found to occur at the approximate time when the plume head visibly separates from the conduit .    to further examine the pinch - off process ,",
    "axisymmetric simulations of autocatalytic plumes were implemented for the fluid parameters corresponding to a reactant solution with 40% glycerol .",
    "similar results were shown for both simulated and experimental plumes  first generation plume heads were observed to accelerate and pinch - off from the conduit , and the metrics used to quantify the morphology of the first generation plume head were in good qualitative agreement with the ones measured for the experimental system .",
    "more importantly , the simulation results provided new insight into the pinch - off process .",
    "it was found that subtle changes in the velocity structure in the conduit occur long before the appearance of external morphological changes associated with pinch - off .",
    "furthermore , it was determined that the vertical component of the fluid velocity in the conduit is less than the ascent velocity of the head at all times , so that the conduit does not contribute buoyancy to the head but rather forms a tail in its wake .",
    "the appearance of velocity minima in this tail are early precursors to the eventual pinch - off of the head .",
    "this velocity profile reveals that autocatalytic plume heads are nearly independent flow structures that are driven mainly by the chemical reaction between fluid in the heads and their surroundings .",

    "<S> a localized source of buoyancy flux in a non - reactive fluid medium creates a plume . </S>",
    "<S> the flux can be provided by either heat , a compositional difference between the fluid comprising the plume and its surroundings , or a combination of both . for autocatalytic plumes produced by the iodate - arsenous acid reaction , </S>",
    "<S> however , buoyancy is produced along the entire reacting interface between the plume and its surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> buoyancy production at the moving interface drives fluid motion , which in turn generates flow that advects the reaction front . as a consequence of this interplay between fluid flow and chemical reaction , </S>",
    "<S> autocatalytic plumes exhibit a rich dynamics during their ascent through the reactant medium . </S>",
    "<S> one of the more interesting dynamical features is the production of an accelerating vortical plume head that in certain cases pinches - off and detaches from the upwelling conduit . </S>",
    "<S> after pinch - off , a new plume head forms in the conduit below , and this can lead to multiple generations of plume heads for a single plume initiation . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the pinch - off process using both experimentation and simulation . </S>",
    "<S> experiments were performed using various concentrations of glycerol , in which it was found that repeated pinch - off occurs exclusively in a specific concentration range . </S>",
    "<S> autocatalytic plume simulations revealed that pinch - off is triggered by the appearance of accelerating flow in the plume conduit .    </S>",
    "<S> [ intro ]    plumes are organized flow structures of considerable importance  @xcite due to their widespread natural occurrence , particularly in geophysical flows  @xcite . a plume can be _ steady _ , in the case when the flow structure is well - developed and is no longer time - dependent , or it can be _ starting _ , in the transient case where buoyant fluid is penetrating the medium into which it is growing . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of work on plumes has focused on the steady variety , since the persistence of the columnar conduit following behind the head plays a significant role in many geophysical processes . </S>",
    "<S> long - lived plume conduits are believed to underlie the formation of mantle hot spots , such as the one responsible for the hawaiian island - emperor seamount chain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider autocatalytic starting plumes in this paper .    before </S>",
    "<S> a laminar starting plume reaches a steady state , it develops its most prominent feature : an evolving head encompassing a vortex ring . usually , the plume head remains attached to the conduit and the conduit remains linked to the buoyancy source  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vortex rings are the subject of a vast literature and have a rich history  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can be produced experimentally by using a piston to transiently inject a finite volume of neutrally buoyant fluid into quiescent surroundings  @xcite , a technique is similar to the vortex ring generator pioneered by p. g. tait in the nineteenth century  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ pinch - off _ refers to the process by which the vortex ring detaches from its source . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to neutrally buoyant scenarios , vortex ring formation and pinch - off has also been investigated in the context of buoyant starting plumes , where results suggest that dimensionless circulation of the ring is a universal quantity , regardless of whether it is produced by pinch - off from a plume head or formed by a piston  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> essentially free buoyant vortex rings can also be created by the pinch - off of plume heads driven by an autocatalytic chemical reaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear chemical kinetics can produce fronts of reaction which are advected by the buoyancy - driven flow created by the reaction itself  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this `` self - stirring '' can , in turn , increase the production of the product species and change the morphology of the reaction front . in a container with a relatively unconfined geometry </S>",
    "<S> , the localized initiation of a nonlinear autocatalytic reaction creates a special sort of reacting plume  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such plumes can be viewed as weakly driven versions of expanding flame fronts , such as the flame `` bubbles '' that detonate type ia supernovae  @xcite . unlike supernovae , autocatalytic plumes are readily produced and studied in the laboratory  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes experimental and numerical investigations on the behavior of autocatalytic plumes produced by the propagating front of the iodate - arsenous acid ( iaa ) reaction  @xcite , focusing on the pinch - off process . </S>",
    "<S> the iaa reaction produces buoyancy - driven flow by its exothermicity and by the isothermal density difference between its reactant and product solutions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effect of adding glycerol to the iaa solution on autocatalytic plume morphology and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> addition of glycerol increases the viscosity of the solution , and it slows the rate of diffusion of the autocatalyst . </S>",
    "<S> we found that pinch - off behavior is most prevalent in a specific window of glycerol concentration . </S>",
    "<S> plumes produced with glycerol concentrations outside this window did not produce multiple pinch - off events . to complement the experiments , we constructed an axisymmetric numerical simulation of autocatalytic plume dynamics and used it to examine the development of the reaction - driven flow that leads to pinch - off . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by identifying the subtle processes in the head and conduit that lead up to pinch - off events . </S>"
