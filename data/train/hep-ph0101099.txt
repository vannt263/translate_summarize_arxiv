    "<S> it is anticipated , however , that at sufficiently small @xmath0 , this increase will be tamed by shadowing corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> the first quantitative studies of gluon shadowing were made by gribov , levin and ryskin @xcite ( glr ) and by mueller and qiu @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the shadowing contribution , @xmath8 , to the gluon distribution @xmath9 , unintegrated over the gluon transverse momentum @xmath10 , is of the form [ eq : a1 ] = - c ^2 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes the transverse area populated by the gluons and @xmath13 is the integrated gluon distribution . the constant @xmath14 will be specified later . when the shadowing term is combined with dglap evolution in the double leading @xmath15 approximation ( dlla ) </S>",

    "<S> which couple the ladders , is computed in the leading @xmath17 approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the glr equation has stimulated an enormous literature [ 318 ] connected with shadowing effects in deep inelastic and related hard scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important results to emerge from these studies is the computation of the exact triple - pomeron vertex beyond leading @xmath17 , but staying within the more appropriate leading @xmath18 approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present study is to take advantage of this precise knowledge of the triple - pomeron vertex in order to perform a quantitative estimate of the gluon shadowing effects which can be probed in the low @xmath0 domain which is accessible at the lhc . to be precise , </S>",

    "<S> then we compute the quadratic shadowing contribution , @xmath20 , from the solution @xmath19 using the more complete triple pomeron vertex . </S>",
    "<S> we resum the shadowing contributions using a simple ( 1,1 ) pad - type representation [ eq : a3 ] f = , and the gluon distribution is then calculated from [ eq : a4 ] xg ( x , q^2 ) = xg ( x , k_0 ^ 2 ) + _ </S>",

    "<S> if we rewrite ( [ eq : a7 ] ) in terms of the transformed function [ eq : a8 ] ( , b , y ) = _ 0^ j_0 ( r ) n ( r , b , y ) , then the shadowing term has a much simpler form [ eq : a9 ] ( , b , y ) = _ 0 ( , b , y ) + _ 0^y dy , where @xmath33 is the bfkl kernel in momentum space @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we have made the short - distance approximation in which we neglect the @xmath34 terms in comparison to @xmath35 , so that @xmath22 is only a function of the magnitudes @xmath25 and @xmath27 , and @xmath36 of @xmath37 and @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we may resum the linear bfkl effects and rearrange ( [ eq : a9 ] ) in the form [ eq : a10 ] ( , b , y ) = _ l ( , b , y ) - _ 0^y dy g ( y - y ) ^2 ( , b , y ) , where @xmath38 is the solution of the linear part of ( [ eq : a9 ] ) with the shadowing term neglected , and @xmath39 is the green s function of the bfkl kernel [ eq : a11 ] g ( y - y ) = ( ( y - y ) k ) </S>",

    "<S> we use ( [ eq : a6 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) to write ( [ eq : a15 ] ) in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain [ eq : a16 ] f ( y , k^2 ) = f_l ( y , k^2 ) - ( 1 - ) ^2 k^2 _ 0^y dy ^2 , where we have used the identities [ eq : a17 ] & & _ </S>",

    "<S> one may expect that there will be other contributions beyond those leading to equation ( [ eq : a7 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general structure of those corrections is unfortunately not entirely known . </S>",
    "<S> one can however expect that after taking them into account it may no longer be possible to obtain a closed equation for @xmath22 since one will have to introduce other independent and more complicated dynamical quantities as well . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be observed that the non - linear equation ( [ eq : a7 ] ) does not contain possible effects generated by the compound states of more than two reggeised gluons @xcite . ] </S>",

    "<S> moreover , we emphasize again that for the linear term @xmath19 we use the solution of an equation which embodies both bfkl and dglap behaviour and which contains major sub - leading effects in @xmath48 @xcite . in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] we show the results for the integrated gluon @xmath2 obtained from ( [ eq : a3 ] ) and ( [ eq : a4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowing term @xmath20 in ( [ eq : a16 ] ) is computed from the unintegrated gluon @xmath19 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , assuming a running coupling @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> several features of the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] are noteworthy . </S>",
    "<S> first we see , as expected , the effect of shadowing on @xmath50 decreases with increasing @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> second , with increasing @xmath52 , the start of the ` turn - over ' towards the saturation limit is evident in the @xmath53 curves . </S>",
    "<S> the major uncertainty in the predictions arises from the choice of the value of @xmath54 , as a consequence of the @xmath55 dependence of the shadowing term . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen values of @xmath54 that are consistent with the radius of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] show that the effects of shadowing are rather small and difficult to identify at hera where , at best , the domain @xmath56 at @xmath57 can be probed . on the other hand shadowing leads to up to a factor of 2 suppression of @xmath58 in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 domain accessible to the lhc experiments @xcite .    for completeness </S>",
    "<S> we summarize how the kovchegov equation @xcite , ( [ eq : a7 ] ) , may be reduced to glr form @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we start with ( [ eq : a6 ] ) and approximate @xmath61 by @xmath62 , which is valid provided @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> then we obtain [ eq : a19 ] ( r , y ) = r^2 ^4/r^2 f ( y , k^2 ) , where the integral can be identified with the integrated gluon @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . thus , from ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , we have [ eq : a20 ] d^2 b n ( , , y ) r^2 xg ( x , 4/r^2 ) . now if ( [ eq : a7 ] ) is evaluated in the strongly - ordered approximation @xmath66 it can be shown , using ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , that it reduces to the glr form [ eq : a21 ] = xg ( x , q^2 ) - ^2 . comparing with ( [ eq : a2 ] ) we see that the coefficient , which is four times larger in the large @xmath28 limit . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have quantified the size of the shadowing corrections to @xmath2 using a triple - pomeron vertex which is valid beyond leading @xmath68 , but staying within the leading @xmath69 approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections are found to be sizeable for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this domain may be probed at the lhc by observing prompt photon production ( @xmath72 ) or drell - yan production both at very large rapidities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course the latter process involves a convolution to allow for the @xmath73 transition , which is required for a gluon - initiated reaction ; consequently somewhat larger values of the gluon @xmath0 are probed . </S>"
