    "schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) is a stochastic process which aims to classify the two - dimensional critical models by focusing on their geometrical quantities @xcite .",
    "the idea of classification of probability measures of random curves growing in the upper half complex plane was first proposed by o. schramm @xcite .",
    "this technique has provided us with a new interpretation of the traditional conformal field theory ( cft ) and coulomb gas approaches . in conformal field theories ( cft )",
    "the emphasis is on the algebraic properties of the critical models dictated by their conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable that there is a connection between this theory and sle .",
    "this relation was found in the pioneering work of m. bauer and d. bernard @xcite in which it was found a relation between the central charge of cft and the diffusivity parameter ( @xmath1 ) of sle .",
    "+ many papers have been published concerning the analytical and numerical properties of interfaces of various two - dimensional ( 2d ) critical models described by sle theory @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis of the various aspects of these critical curves contains valuable information of the model in hand . in the numerical studies of the less - known 2d critical models ,",
    "the main concern is to extract the diffusivity parameter ( referred to as @xmath1 ) of their critical interfaces to relate the underlying model to a cft class @xcite .",
    "therefore the dependence of statistical observables to @xmath1 is of paramount importance in this area @xcite .",
    "as an example of these statistical observables , one can mention fokker - planck ( fp ) equation @xcite , left passage probability @xcite , crossing probability @xcite , etc . which are directly related to the diffusivity parameter ( @xmath1 ) of sle . in spite of many analysis addressing the fp equation for",
    "the sle traces in various papers @xcite , a complete and comprehensive analysis of this subject is missing in the literature yet , e.g. the actual behavior of the solutions of this equation in the whole domain of the model and a comprehensive investigation of the fp equation for the dipolar and radial sle and sle(@xmath0 ) . ) . in this paper",
    "we use sle(@xmath0 ) in order not to be confused with the probability density @xmath2 to be defined in sec [ fp ] .",
    "our analysis is limited to the case @xmath3 . ]",
    "the question _ what the statistical properties of the tip of the growing random curves are in the sle(@xmath1 ) and sle(@xmath0 ) _ is the main concern of this paper .",
    "the importance of the statistical analysis ( such as fp equation ) of sle(@xmath0 ) can be understood , e.g. for the case in which the curve in its growth process _ experiences _ some boundary condition changes ( bcc ) in some point on the boundary of the domain of growth .",
    "this situation which occurs in most cases in the numerical analysis of the less - known models should be investigated within sle(@xmath0 ) theory .",
    "such analysis may help to analyze these behaviors .",
    "+ in this paper we analyze the various aspects of the fp equation of sle traces . to this end",
    ", we firstly show how to employ the backward sle equation and find the langevin equation for the spatial coordinates of the tip of the sle trace .",
    "we analyze these equations in short and long time limits and show that for ordinary ( chordal ) sle in long time both horizontal and vertical components of the tip of the sle trace behave as @xmath4 ( @xmath5 time ) as expected . to do so , we find the behaviors of sle traces for long times in two ways ; directly solving the fp equation and using the langevin equation .",
    "we then connect the fp equation to the cft and find some exact behaviors . for sle(@xmath0 ) , however there is other preferred point on the real axis , causing the situation be different . to analyze this case",
    "we first find the behavior of the curves for short times perturbatively .",
    "the long - time behaviors are also investigated by analyzing the langevin equation .",
    "we finally report some exact behaviors of this case by means of its cft counterpart .",
    "+ the paper has been organized as follows : in sec [ sle ] we present a short introduction to sle(@xmath1 ) and its variant sle(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the sec [ fp ] has been devoted to the derivation of fp equations for the sle traces .",
    "fp equation for the sle(@xmath0 ) is derived in sec [ fpsle ] and the short and long time limits of this equation is derived in this section .",
    "as a well - known fact , the critical 2d models have special algebraic and geometrical properties .",
    "the algebraic properties of these models are described within the conformal field theories .",
    "however these theories are unable to uncover the geometrical features of these models since it concerns the local fields defined in these models .",
    "according to schramm s idea one can describe the interfaces of two - dimensional ( 2d ) critical models via growth processes named as sle .",
    "thanks to this theory however , a deep connection between their local properties and their global ( geometrical ) features has been discovered .",
    "this theory aims to describe the 2d critical models by focusing their interfaces .",
    "these non - intersecting _ domain - walls _ are assumed to have two essential properties , conformal invariance and the domain markov property . in the sle theory one",
    "replaces the critical curve by a dynamical one .",
    "+ we consider the model on the upper half plane , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "let us denote the curve up to time @xmath7 as @xmath8 and the hull @xmath9 as the set of points which are located exactly on the @xmath8 trace , or are disconnected from the infinity by @xmath8 .",

    "loewner showed that this mapping satisfies the following equation @xcite : @xmath16 with the initial condition @xmath17 and for which the tip of the curve ( up to time @xmath7 ) is mapped to the point @xmath18 on the real axis . for fixed @xmath19",

    "sle aims to analyze these critical curves by classifying them to the one - parameter classes represented by @xmath1 .",
    "+ there are three phases for these curves : + * dilute phase * : for @xmath25 the trace is non - self - intersecting and it does not hit the real axis . therefore in this case",

    "+ there is a connection between the two phases : in the dense phase the frontier of @xmath31 ( the boundary of @xmath32 minus any portions of the real axis ) is a sle curve .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this simple curve is locally described by the diffusivity parameter @xmath33 in the dilute phase . + the correspondence to cft is via a simple relation between diffusivity parameter @xmath1 and the cft - central charge @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "( boundary change has been shown schematically by ( @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 ) ) . ]    . ]",
    "let us now suppose that there is a preferred point on the real axis , namely at @xmath38 as indicated in fig [ slekrevol1 ] and [ slekrevol2 ] .",
    "we are going to analyze the random curve in presence of this point .",
    "note that the conformal invariance of the curve has been explicitly broken , however the curve is yet self - similar .",
    "sle(@xmath0 ) is a variant of ordinary ( chordal ) sle which analyzes such curves .",

    ", the bcc imposed in @xmath40 corresponds to putting a bcc operator with conformal weight @xmath42 at that point ] @xcite .",
    "+ for these curves the stochastic equation is the same as formula ( [ loewner ] ) .",
    "the driving function @xmath18 acquires however a drift term with respect to the chordal sle : @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is one - dimensional brownian motion and @xmath45 is the transformation of the point @xmath40 under the action of @xmath46 .",
    "this situation can be generalized to a set up with the arbitrary number of bcc s .",
    "+   + * real - axis to real - axis random curves : * + as an example of the above discussion , we consider the fig [ slekrevol2 ] in which the mentioned preferred point is the ending point of the curve ( which does not go to the infinity , but after the exploration process turns to the real axis ) . for this set - up , by using the conformal map @xmath47 , one can send the end point of the curve to the infinity .",
    "since our model is conformal invariant , we can deduce that the function @xmath48 describes ordinary ( chordal ) sle from which one easily concludes that @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 in which @xmath51 .",
    "the other criteria is to make the mapping hydrodynamically normalized .",

    "( [ loewner ] ) with the price that @xmath18 acquires a drift term as follows @xcite : @xmath52 in the other words , this stochastic function is the driving function of the sle(@xmath0 ) with @xmath3 .",
    "thus for the critical curves from boundary to boundary , the corresponding driving function acquires a drift term .",
    "this generalization of sle can be generalized further to have multiple preferred real axis points and multi - critical curves @xcite . for review",
    "see also references @xcite .",
    "+ the other example is the traces which terminate surely to the real axis in the interval @xmath53 . for these curves of course the point @xmath54 is regarded as the preferred point for which @xmath55 yields dipolar sle(@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "and the backward conformal map @xmath56 on the sle trace . ]    in this section we are going to find the langevin equation for the tip of the chordal sle trace .",
