    "the dark matter ( dm ) is a component of the total density of the universe which can be measured only through gravitational interactions and ( likely ) weak interactions .",
    "it behaves as dust - like matter in the sense that it is collisionless and that its energy density decreases as the third power of the scale factor .",
    "there are many compelling evidences of its existence , although all of them are indirect .",
    "these are mainly dynamical evidences , which rely on the gravitational influence of dm .",
    "some examples of these evidences are the rotation curves of late type galaxies @xcite , galaxy cluster dynamics @xcite and strong lensing @xcite , among others .",
    "the effects of dm are very important not only for determining the dynamics of galaxies or galaxy clusters , but also for the evolution of the universe as a whole , and for the galaxy formation processes and structure formation scenarios .    for example , assuming that the dm consists of particles that were originally in thermal equilibrium with the radiation in the early universe , depending on the mass of the particles , the structure formation scenario will be top down or hierarchical . in the top down structure formation scenario , the first structures to collapse are large ( on the mass scale that corresponds to present - day superclusters ) , because all overdensities at smaller scales are erased by free streaming .",
    "this is the case for a hot dark matter ( hdm ) model , in which the dm particles were relativistic at the time of decoupling . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "small ( and also large ) structures start to collapse after decoupling , because dm particles were non - relativistic at the time of decoupling , and so the free streaming is negligible .",
    "this is the case for a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model @xcite . because the @xmath10 model is currently the most favoured one ( see for example the results by planck @xcite ) , we study this particular scenario in this work .",
    "the postulated cdm particle has been named a wimp ( or weakly interacting massive particle ) , because it weakly couples to normal matter ( for introductions to the topic of dm astrophysics , see @xcite and @xcite ) . in the standard scenario ,",
    "this particle is considered to be a thermal relic .",
    "this means that its creation and annihilation processes from the early universe radiation field were in thermal equilibrium with each other , and thus , the present day dm number density is the relic abundance after the freeze - out of this processes , with annihilation being favoured after the universe had cooled enough @xcite .",
    "this fact alone allows for the computation of the interaction cross section for the creation - annihilation process given only the present day abundance of dm ( its density parameter @xmath11 ) .",
    "an important feature of a self - annihilating thermal relic wimp is that the annihilation products are standard model particles , and thus , they may inject energy to the igm or to the medium where a particular dm halo is embedded .",
    "globally , the annihilations of wimps are unlikely to occur because their abundance has long ago frozen",
    ". however , there may be regions where encounters among wimps are more probable due to an enhanced density .",
    "these regions are precisely the regions where structures form .",
    "now , it is a direct consequence of the @xmath10 model that dm is clumpy , due to the hierarchical growth of structure .",
    "thus , it is precisely in the inner regions of dm haloes and substructures that the annihilations are more probable .",
    "the energy output due to annihilations will be proportional to the square of the density , thus , these local density enhancements are of great importance @xcite .",
    "the first hierarchy in density enhancements are the dm haloes that do not belong to any gravitationally bound structure at a particular redshift . in n - body",
    "dm only simulations , these are called main haloes .",
    "an analytic formalism to quantify the number density of these haloes per decade in mass is given by the press - schechter formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite among others ) .",
    "this formalism considers that the overdensity field of the universe is a gaussian field , and thus , the properties of its fourier transform are known .",
    "one can define the matter power - spectrum as the square of the complex modulus of the overdensity in k space , and compute the variance of the matter fluctuations of scales of a given mass , as a window - smoothed average of the power spectrum on the corresponding volume .",
    "the press - schechter formalism then allows to obtain the number density of haloes considering that the gravitational collapse is a self - similar process , and thus , a given halo collapses if its mass scale variance surpasses a certain theshold for collapse at that redshift , and the probability that a halo has the required mass is distributed gaussianly with the variance corresponding to the associated mass .",
    "the second hierarchy in density enhancements are the substructures embedded in a particular halo .",
    "as the gravitational collapse is a self - similar process , each halo will be the end node ( the trunk ) of an inverted halo merger tree at that redshift @xcite .",
    "as the dm is non - collisional , it relaxes much slower than normal matter , because it can not radiate away energy to fall to the bottom of the gravitational potential well .",
    "also , as friction is negligible , the angular momentum barrier will make the dm subhaloes to acquire stable orbits around the center of mass , but these subhaloes will retain their identities .",
    "thus , inside each dm halo , it is expected that the full hierarchy of dm haloes is nested within , until the lowest mass haloes that formed .",
    "the number density of these subhaloes can be measured in milky - way sized halo simulations , and by approximating their abundance by a power - law behaviour ( via lactea ii simulation @xcite , acquarius project simulation @xcite ) .    apart from the number density of haloes and subhaloes , it is important to quantify the form of the density distribution within a particular structure , in order to compute the annihilation power output .",
    "@xcite , when studying the clustering of dm in n - body simulations , found that haloes from different cold dark matter cosmologies all have the same universal density profile ( the nfw profile ) .",
    "this profile is characterized by two parameters , the scale radius and the scale density , and this parameters can be ( on average ) regarded as a function of the halo mass and the redshift . also , this dm density profile may be further enhanced by the gravitational effect of baryons on dm through adiabatic compression ( see , for example @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the total resulting dm distribution in the universe can be computed at a particular redshift .",
    "knowing the global dm distribution , one can compute the resulting energy output per baryon , which can be further compared with what can be obtained assuming a perfectly homogeneous dm distribution ( see @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "one can also compute the energy generated per unit time by a particular halo of a given mass and redshift , and one can calculate what is the energy received by a particular halo due to the rest of the universe .",
    "this additional energy injection may have interesting effects on the global igm , as well as on the environment within particular dm haloes .",
    "for example , several authors ( for example @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite among others ) have studied the effects of dm annihilation ( and also decays , in different dm models ) on the igm temperature and on the global ionization fraction .",
    "this extra heating may be detectable through the global 21 cm differential brightness temperature , measurable in the mhz frequency range .",
    "this differential brightness temperature arises as a result of the coupling of the neutral hydrogen spin temperature ( that accounts for the hyperfine transition ) to the igm kinetic temperature , thus causing a difference between the spin temperature and the cmb temperature .",
    "also , the energy input may contribute as an extra heating mechanism within haloes that can add up to the standard sne and agn feedback mechanisms ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and may change the temperature of the halo environment .    regarding the observational evidence for the energy injection due to dm annihilations",
    ", no definite conclusion has been drawn yet . however , different observations of anomalous enhancements in detected signals from high - energy phenomena in the galactic halo and in the cosmic background suggest its presence .",
    "these signals correspond mainly to gamma ray detections ( fermi @xcite , h.e.s.s @xcite and egret @xcite experiments ) and to measurements of cosmic ray positron fractions ( pamela @xcite experiment ) .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite analyse the data sets by pamela , fermi and h.e.s.s . , and",
    "conclude that the observed signals could be accounted for by a @xmath12 wimp .",
    "they also find an enhanced interaction cross - section ( sommerfeld enhancement ) for the annihilation process ( @xmath13 times the thermal relic wimp value ) .",
    "a similar result was also obtained by @xcite with respect to the egret gamma ray data @xcite .",
    "however , there is some debate regarding the compatibility of the presence of sommerfeld enhancement with the non - detection of gamma ray flux from known dm structures ( like galaxy clusters ) . in this line",
    ", the study by @xcite determines that the attempts of explaining the fermi , pamela and h.e.s.s . combined data with @xmath12 wimps and cross sections enhanced by factors of @xmath14 , are incompatible with the egret upper limits on the gamma ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster .",
    "regarding the fermi gamma ray excess , @xcite argue that it can be well accounted for by non - exotic processes ( decaying pions , inverse compton , point sources , etc ... ) , except within @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) from the galactic center , where the gamma ray excess is consistent with the prediction of a cusped ( @xmath17 ) dm density profile , and annihilating wimps with a thermal relic cross - section ( no sommerfeld enhancement ) and masses in the range @xmath18 .",
    "also , @xcite found that the excess microwave radiation within @xmath19 from the galactic center , found by the wmap experiment and called the wmap haze , can be well explained by a cusped dm profile with @xmath20 in the inner kiloparsecs , and a wimp with mass in the @xmath21 to multi - tev range and thermal relic cross section .",
    "however , according to the recent null results in dm direct detection obtained by the lux collaboration @xcite , a wimp with masses between @xmath22 an @xmath23 is increasingly disfavoured .",
    "also , for lower mass light dark matter ( ldm ) particle candidates ( with masses in the @xmath24 range ) , possible constraints on the mass and cross section coming from the cmb have been studied ( see section 5 of @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the effect on the cmb by massive wimps , like the ones studied in this work , would be completely negligible . it can be seen that no clear consensus exists neither on the significance of the results as positive indirect detections of dm , nor on the importance of these detections for discriminating among different wimp scenarios .",
    "what can be said nonetheless , is that evidence of possible new exotic physics is accumulating , and that wimp dm annihilation represents a well motivated option . as for the evidence for sommerfeld enhancement , it is specially controversial and largely model - dependent .",
    "however , the dm annihilation interpretation of the observational evidence supports wimp masses in the range @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    the main goal of this work is to compute this additional energy injection , both locally within haloes and globally , and to asses the importance of this injection on the different processes mentioned above .",
    "all the computations will be done considering a cosmology consistent with the planck 2013 results @xcite . in particular",
    ", we will use @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the thermal relic wimp , and the two above mentioned well motivated particular dm models will be explained in greater detail . in section 3 , the statistics of the dm clustering on all hierarchies will be developed and the nfw universal density profile , as well as the adiabatic compression mechanism will be explained . in section 4 , the dm annihilation energy output ,",
    "both globally ( per baryon ) and locally within a particular dm halo will be computed . also , the clumpiness factor , defined as the ratio of output between the smoothed and fully clumped cases , will be calculated . in section 5",
    ", the energy injected on the medium of a particular halo , due to the contribution of the rest of the universe , will be obtained for different cosmological scenarios . in section 6 , the effects of the annihilation energy injection on the global igm will be followed in detail , computing the igm temperature , the ionization fraction and the resulting 21 cm differential brightness temperature in this scenario .",
    "the general conclusions will be presented in section 7 .",
    "as was previously mentioned in the introduction , the wimp is a theorized particle that allows to account for the missing mass in the universe .",
    "the evidence of this missing mass is ( as previously mentioned ) mainly gravitational .",
    "this missing mass can not come however from normal baryonic matter , because current big - bang nucleosynthesis constraints , like for example the primordial helium abundance ( section 10.4 of @xcite ) , set stringent limits on the normal matter content .    for a certain particle , motivated by some beyond - standard physical scenario , to be a viable wimp candidate",
    ", it must have some basic properties .",
    "for example , it has to be charge - neutral and it can interact only weakly with ordinary matter . also , it has to be collisionless and massive in order to behave as cold dark matter .",
    "a light dm particle will behave as warm or hot dark matter depending on if it was relativistic or not at the time of decoupling and also depending on its free streaming length @xcite , and the resulting structure formation scenario or minimum halo mass will be different to the cdm case . also , a wimp must be stable , or have a decay time longer than ( or at least comparable to ) the present hubble time .    in some well motivated physical scenarios , the wimp is a thermal relic .",
    "this means , as was mentioned before , that its creation and annihilation reaction were in thermal equilibrium with the radiation background in the early universe .",
    "then , as the universe cooled down , the annihilation reaction was increasingly favoured over the creation reaction due to the rest - mass energy difference between both states",
    ". finally , as the expansion rate of the universe became larger than the annihilation reaction rate , the global abundance of dm ( its comoving number density ) was frozen , and the probability of occurrence of an annihilation event became negligible .    in two well studied scenarios ,",
    "the wimp particles are such that they are their own anti - particle .",
    "for example in the case of a kaluza - klein excited state , arising naturally in compactified extra - dimensional models ( like universal extra dimensions or ued , in which all particles are able to propagate in the extra dimension provided they have enough energy ) , the wimp is the lightest neutral gauge boson excited state , corresponding to the first excited state of the b boson or @xmath33 , and as the standard model b boson , it is its own antiparticle ( the b boson is a superposition of the photon of quantum electrodynamics and the z boson of the weak interaction ) . also , in the case of the mssm ( the minimal supersymetric standard model )",
    ", considering conserved r - parity ( and thus that superpartners are forbidden to decay to standard model particles ) , the wimp is the lightest neutralino ( i.e. , the lightest mass eigenstate of the fermionic superpartners of the gauge bosons and the higgses ) , and it is a majorana fermion , and thus it is its own antiparticle .    in both these scenarios , the annihilation cross section is dependent only on the present day abundance of dm .",
    "this fact has been dubbed the wimp miracle and is explained in what follows .",
    "the wimp miracle refers to the fact that , given that the wimp is a thermal relic , its creation / annihilation cross section can be computed without needing extra model - dependent input ( except for the fact that the cross section must not depend on the energy of the wimp , i.e. , the s - wave cross section must be dominant ) .",
    "the cross section then only depends on the present day dm density parameter @xmath11 , and the present day value of the hubble parameter @xmath34 ( that gives the current expansion rate ) .",
    "intuitively , one would think that a higher cross section @xmath35 would lead to less relic abundance of dm , thus resulting in a smaller value of @xmath11 .",
    "both quantities are , indeed , inversely proportional to each other .",
    "obtaining this cross section is a standard derivation and it is done in , for example , section 5.2 of @xcite . for the value of the cross section , @xcite use @xmath36",
    "$ ] , and in the cosmology used in this work , that gives :    @xmath37.\\ ] ]    in all that follows , we will use that value for the cross section of wimp annihilation .",
    "now we will motivate and explain two scenarios that give rise naturally to a thermal relic wimp with the above - given cross section .      in extra dimensional models ( i.e. , physical models that are built considering more than three spatial dimensions ) ,",
    "the additional spatial degrees of freedom may be accessible to all or some of the particles .",
    "also , these additional dimensions may be compactified differently and on different energy scales .",
    "if a standard model particle can propagate in this compactified ( and thus finitely extended ) dimensions , they will appear more massive in the four dimensional effective theory . in some cases",
    ", these excited states of standard model particles may have the desirable features of the wimp . here",
    "we will briefly discuss the lightest kk particle wimp candidate and the extra - dimensional scenario in which it arises .",
    "we loosely follow the excellent review by @xcite .",
    "one extra dimensional scenario that is interesting for being able to provide a suitable dm particle is universal extra dimensions ( ued ) . in this scenario , proposed by @xcite , all standard model ( sm ) particles are able to propagate in the extra dimension . because this dimension is compactified , and thus has a finite extent , the momentum that a particle can acquire in it will be discrete ( the idea is similar to that of an electron propagating in a box of given size ) , thus giving an apparent extra rest - mass in the four dimensional world",
    ".    the spectra of different possible momentum states in the extra dimension will give a series of possible masses of a particle , quantized by the number of the excitation state .",
    "this masses will depend on the radius of compactification and will be given roughly by :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the mass of the @xmath40 excited kaluza - klein state of a sm particle @xmath41 , @xmath42 is its mass in the sm and @xmath43 is the compactification radius of the extra dimension , given in natural units ( so it has dimension of @xmath44 ) .",
    "then , the kk particles are the same sm particles , but considering their excitations in the extra dimension . interactions between sm particles and kk particles are possible , but are suppressed ( thus , these particles are weakly interacting ) . moreover ,",
    "the lightest kk particle is stable because of conservation of momentum in the extra dimension .",
    "as was already mentioned , the lightest kk particle in the ued framework is the @xmath33 , i.e. , the first kk excited state of the b gauge boson ( also called the kk - photon ) .",
    "this particle is charge neutral , and can annihilate with itself , and thus is a suitable wimp candidate .",
    "some of the ways in which kk particles can interact with sm particles are through decays , annihilations and scatterings . for example , a heavier kk particle can decay into a lighter kk particle emitting standard model particles , until it has cascaded into the @xmath33 ( also called @xmath45 , see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "also , more interestingly in view of the possible effects of wimp annihilation on the igm , two @xmath33s can annihilate to lepton pairs and photons ( see figure 16 of @xcite ) .",
    "supersymmetry is a particular symmetry property of the lagrangian of a physical theory , such that said lagrangian remains invariant if a supersymetric transformation is performed on the fields of the theory .",
    "the supersymmetric transformation is such that the change in a fermionic field is a bosonic field , and the change in a bosonic field is a fermionic filed .",
    "as in quantum field theory , the fields represent different particle contents ( the particles are nothing more than the excited states of the fields ) , a supersymmetric theory naturally has one boson for each fermion present , and vice - versa .",
    "the particle content of the mssm ( the minimal supersymmetric standard model ) is the same as that of the sm , but for every sm particle , there is an associated supersymmetric partner ( also , the higgs field is different from the one in the sm , being two fields instead of just one ) . the naming scheme for the superpartners is to maintain the root of the name of the sm particle , but to change the end of the name with the suffix -ino in the case of fermionic superpartners of sm bosons and to add the prefix s- in the case of bosonic ( scalar ) superpartners of sm fermions .",
    "for example , the superpartners of the electron and the muon are the selectron and the smuon , and the superpartners of the photon and the z boson are the photino and the zino .",
    "the wimp candidate of susy is the lightest neutralino ( unless the gravitino , the superpartner of the graviton in supergravity is lighter than the neutralino , but this scenario will not be considered here ) .",
    "the neutralinos are the mass eigenstates of the superpartners of the neutral gauge bosons and the higgses , i.e. , the bino ( @xmath46 ) , neutral wino ( @xmath47 ) and the neutral higgsinos ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "they are labelled @xmath50 in order of increasing mass , such that the @xmath51 corresponds to the lightest neutralino .",
    "the @xmath51 , ( the wimp candidate ) will be in general a linear combination of the gauginos ( bino and wino ) and the higgsinos , and it will have a somewhat different phenomenology depending on its specific particle mixture . although the precise differences between a mainly gaugino , mainly higgsino or mixed gaugino - higgsino type neutralino are beyond the scope of this work , it is sufficient to mention that , in general ( in order to give the appropriate above - mentioned interaction cross section ) , a mixed gaugino - higgsino composition is assumed .    in r - parity conserving susy scenarios",
    ", no superpartner can decay to sm particles only ( sm particles have different r - parity than superpartners ) , and so the lightest neutralino ( @xmath51 ) will be stable , whereas more massive susy particles can decay into the @xmath51 emitting standard model particles ( as long as the standard conservation rules are not violated ) . also , the ( @xmath51 ) is a majorana fermion , and thus it can self - annihilate into sm particles .",
    "the susy particles can also interact ( scatter off ) standard model particles , but these scatterings are suppressed , thus the @xmath51 is weakly interacting .",
    "the main annihilation processes of neutralino into sm particles is into fermion pairs , although it can also annihilate into gauge bosons ( w and z ) at tree - level . at 1-loop level",
    ", the neutralino can annihilate directly into gluons or photons , and although this is greatly suppressed compared to tree - level processes , the direct decay into photons is important because it signals a smoking gun of annihilation ( the resulting two photons will have an energy very close to the neutralino rest - mass energy , and so it is a clear signal with no contaminants ) .",
    "the feynman diagrams of the tree - level annihilation channels are shown in figures 9 , 10 and 16 of @xcite .",
    "finally , it is important to mention that the phenomenologies of kk particles ( as they arise in ued ) and of susy are very similar , and both of them could be tested , for example in particle colliders , by studying interactions above a certain energy scale . in the case of kk",
    ", this energy scale corresponds to the inverse of the radius of compactification of the extra dimmension , whereas in susy , it corresponds to the mass of the neutralinos and superpartners .",
    "current collider lower limits on the mass scale of this new physics ( for example the lhc limits ) are on the order of the  100 gev and increasing .",
    "this mass limit will motivate the values that we adopt for the wimp mass in the rest of this work .",
    "we use both a wimp mass of 10 gev and of 1tev .",
    "as it was mentioned , the gravitational collapse process is hierarchical and self - similar , and so different levels of clustering are expected . in the following subsections",
    "we explain the prescriptions adopted to account for the dm clustering at all these levels , considering also the distribution of dm within a particular halo or subhalo . in section 3.1 , we follow the analytic approach , using the press - schechter formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite among others ) to compute the number density of dm haloes per decade in mass . in section 3.2",
    ", we account for the presence of substructure by considering the substructure mass function given by @xcite . in section 3.3",
    ", we present the universal nfw density profile @xcite , that gives the dm distribution within each gravitationally bound halo , and explain how to calculate its parameters for different halo masses at different redshifts .",
    "finally , in section 3.4 , we explain the effect that the gravitational collapse of the barionic matter ( in particular , the formation of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) ) can have on the dm density profile through adiabatic compression .",
    "we use this formalism , as presented in @xcite , but using the modified @xcite halo mass function and bias factor , calibrated with the gif simulations @xcite .",
    "we consider the overdensity @xmath52 defined as @xmath53 , and the overdensity threshold for collapse @xmath54 , defined as the density contrast ( in the linear approximation ) required for an overdensity in a certain region to already have formed a collapsed object ( @xcite , equation a14 ) .",
    "we consider also the mass fluctuation @xmath55 , defined as the standard deviation of the matter overdensity field when smoothed on a scale of size r. finally , the dimensionless mass parameter is defined as @xmath56 , and it is a measurement of the mass of a collapsed region ( dm halo ) relative to the mass of the structures that have recently collapsed at redshift z.    we will use the @xcite probability distribution @xmath57 . the mass fluctuation @xmath58 is computed following @xcite and @xcite , starting from the power spectrum of matter overdensities , @xmath59 , at redshift z. when calculating the mass function we adopt a primordial power spectrum of the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a normalization .",
    "we use the planck 2013 ( @xcite ) scalar index , @xmath62 .",
    "the effects on the power spectrum due to the gravitational collapse of the dm on sub - horizon scales after the radiation - matter equality epoch and the barion acoustic oscillations ( baos ) are encoded in the transfer function .",
    "we adopt the functional form given by bardeen et al .",
    "( the bbks transfer function ) , which ignores the baos .",
    "the second level of clustering of the dm corresponds to the self - bounded haloes that retain their identity within bigger haloes .",
    "the presence of these substructures is a natural consequence of the hierarchical structure formation picture , because haloes at all redshifts are formed by the aggregation of smaller parent haloes .",
    "as the dm is collisionless , dm haloes are significantly less disrupted than barionic matter during the merging processes , and thus subhaloes may survive up to the smallest scales ( due to the negligible , but nonzero , free - streaming of the wimps ) . many authors ( for example @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "have investigated the clustering properties of the subhaloes by means of fitting an analytic form to the subhalo mass function obtained in high - resolution numerical n - body simulations and re - simulations .",
    "we use the substructure mass function proposed by @xcite , because it also considers the evolution of the substructure in time , due to the combined effects of gravitational heating and tidal stripping in the potential well of the main halo .",
    "these effects will tend to erode the subhaloes , which are the remnants of the haloes accreted by the host halo .",
    "as was found by these authors , the mass loss ( to the smooth component of the main halo ) of subhaloes can be approximated by an exponential decay of the subhalo mass on a characteristic timescale that is proportional to the dynamical time of the main halo .",
    "explicitly , the unevolved subhalo mass function ( that considers all subhaloes with the mass they had when they were accreted ) is universal , and is given by :    @xmath63    with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "these values were calibrated using the gif @xcite and gif2 @xcite simmulations , as well as resimulations done by @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath66 represents the unevolved subhalo mass ( the mass that the halo had when it was accreted ) and @xmath67 represents the present - day host mass .    to account for time evolution , the authors find the following relation between the mass of a subhalo at time @xmath68 ( given that it was accreted at time @xmath69 ) , and its unevolved mass :    @xmath70,\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is the evolved mass and @xmath72 is the characteristic mass loss time , given by    @xmath73^{-1/2}\\left[\\frac{h(z)}{h_{0 } } \\right]^{-1},\\ ] ]    and @xmath74 .    in this work , it was useful to approximate the accretion time of all haloes by the time at which the main halo collapsed , corresponding to a redshift @xmath75 , which we take as the redshift at which it acquired half of its mass ( see section 3.3 )",
    ". in terms of the look - back time to redshift z ( @xmath76 ) , equation 15 can be approximated by :    @xmath77.\\ ] ]    now , the required subhalo mass function is the one that includes the mass loss of subhaloes in time , so it should be @xmath78 , using the chain rule . expressing the subhalo mass function in terms of @xmath71 instead of @xmath66 ,",
    "one obtains :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the present day ( at redshift z ) , evolved mass of a subhalo , @xmath81 is the mass of the host halo and @xmath82 is defined by    @xmath83.\\ ] ]    it can be seen that the behaviour of the subhalo mass function is that of a power law with an exponential cutoff , and that all mass scales are displaced as a function of time since halo formation .",
    "the displacement is such that a present day subhalo of mass @xmath80 , corresponded to a halo of greater mass ( by a factor @xmath82 ) , and so its abundance is decreased because it is the abundance corresponding to the greater mass at the time of halo formation .",
    "these last two equations give the number of subhaloes present in a halo of mass @xmath84 at redshift z , that have a mass between @xmath80 and @xmath85 , and so correspond to the subhalo mass function that we need . in the next section ,",
    "we explore the smooth density profile of a particular halo , in order to account for the last level of the dm clustering hierarchy .",
    "the last hierarchy corresponds to how the dm is smoothly distributed within a particular halo or subhalo .",
    "this dm distribution appears to be universal , as found by @xcite using n - body simulations , and is given by the nfw density profile :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the characteristic density and @xmath88 is the scale radius .",
    "thus , the nfw profile depends on only two parameters , which on average only depend on the mass of a halo and the redshift at which it is observed . before obtaining these parameters",

    "we proceed to study the consequences of the collapse of the baryons on the density profile of the dm haloes , and obtain a modified density profile for the latter considering the growth of a central smbh , a process that appears to be ubiquitous in galaxy formation .",
    "we consider the modification in the nfw dm density profile resulting from the gravitational collapse of baryons .",
    "baryons behave dynamically differently from dm in their collapse process because they can heat and radiate away their energy , as they are not collisionless and have nonzero internal pressure .",
    "thus , as they lose energy , they fall towards the center of the gravitational potential well ( this process is also called baryonic infall or cooling ) .",
    "this is the main mechanism that allows the formation of galaxies within the dm haloes , and it is also responsible for the adiabatic compression of the dm halo density profile .",
    "however , baryonic cooling will only take place in dm haloes with masses above a certain critical mass @xmath102 .",
    "a first estimate of this critical mass is the jeans mass , such that the baryons in haloes with smaller masses are pressure - supported ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the jeans criteria assumes that the dm perturbation from which the halo is formed is still in the linear regime , which is not the case for already virialized haloes , and therefore , @xcite consider a slightly different @xmath102 criteria that accounts for the details of the collapse process .",
    "finally , one could worry that the presence of dm itself may alter the @xmath102 , but as shown by @xcite , although the jeans mass is altered , the @xmath102 as considered by tegmark changes by an @xmath103 factor only ( and this is considering ldm , because for the case of the massive wimps under study , it would be essentially unchanged ) .",
    "therefore , in this work , we will consider that only those haloes ( main and substructure ) that attain a mass greater than @xmath104 , as given in the figure 6 of @xcite , are able to undergo adiabatic compression .",

    "we implement this algorithm as described in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm assumes that the density profile is of the initial nfw form up to the radius of gravitational influence of the smbh ( defined as the radius up to which it is the main contributor to the contained mass ) , and that within this radius , the density profile is described by a power - law with a different ( steeper ) exponent .",

    "it is important to mention that the energy injection rate to the igm per baryon computed in this way , considers only the contribution of the dm haloes and not of the smooth component . in the case of a zero free - streaming mass ,",
    "all the dm would be in haloes since there would be no minimum mass scale for the formation of collapsed structures .",
    "however , due to the non - zero free streaming mass , all haloes with masses less than that value , that should exist according to the halo mass function , are simply not allowed to form . as the clumped energy injection should be always greater than the smooth energy injection ( computed in section 4.1 ) , and as the contribution due to dm haloes will be declining rapidly with increasing redshift after the truncation of low mass haloes due to the free - streaming limit becoming important , a good approximation is to use as the clumped dm injection rate the greater value among the one calculated in equation ( 47 ) , and the one calculated in section 4.1 .",

    ". however , the curve for this case has a cutoff at @xmath202 instead of at @xmath203 like for the cases considering a 1tev wimp .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the higher free - streaming mass ( and thus , higher minimum mass that haloes can have ) , and the fact that the mass of the haloes that have a characteristic @xmath183 ( the haloes that have just recently collapsed ) decreases with increasing redshift , such that with a higher free - streaming mass , less haloes are allowed to form at higher redshifts .",
    "we can see that the presence of adiabatic compression is also very important for boosting the annihilation energy injection .",
    "we also note that the curves considering adiabatic compression have a secondary broad peak at lower redshift , besides the peak adjacent to the cutoff .",
    "this secondary peak is present due to the existence of @xmath102 , because for higher redshifts , the fraction of haloes that have @xmath204 decreases due to the redshift dependence of the halo mass function , and so does the energy output in dm annihilations .",
    "the case considering both adiabatic compression and substructure is indistinguishable from the case that considers only adiabatic compression and no substructure , which is in agreement with what was discussed in section 4.2 with respect to the interpretation of figure 3 .    in the next section ,",

    "we refer the reader to the paper of the authors for further details.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    in general , it can be seen that for all the cases considered , the clumpiness is a decreasing function of redshift .",
    "this is reasonable , because as the redshift increases , the universe will tend to be more homogeneous and uniform , because the gravitational collapse and formation of structures would have had less and less time to occur .",
    "also , for all the cases considered , the universe will be practically completely homogeneous by redshift ( @xmath203 ) , except for the case with @xmath6 dm wimp , in which the universe becomes homogeneous at redshift ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "note that in this case , although @xmath209 is higher than for the other cases by almost an order of magnitude at redshift zero , @xmath210 is higher as well , and so the clumpiness c(z ) is not .",
    "it can also be seen that in agreement with what was discussed before , the adiabatic compression mechanism is important for low redshifts , and the presence of substructure is irrelevant for increasing the clumpiness provided that the adiabatic compression is present ( for haloes and subhaloes with @xmath204 ) , as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "we show also the clumpiness factors @xmath211 obtained by @xcite , in figure 5 , using different line - styles .",
    "the two sets of curves can be readily compared as the definitions of the clumpiness factors are the same .",
    "there are , however , differences in the methods for computing them . in particular , @xcite compute the halo mass function using the p - s theory , starting from an analytic fit to @xmath212 , and then consider that substructure and sub - substructure follow a pure power - law mass function with exponent @xmath213 .",
    "we refer the reader to the authors for further detail about their computation procedure . in general",
    ", it can be seen that we predict less clumpiness than the authors at low redshift , but comparable clumpiness than the authors at high redshift .",

    "any given halo , the radiation contributed by all the structures external to it will be characterized in terms of a specific intensity field , and then , the received luminosity will depend on the effective cross - section of this halo to the presence of the radiation field . in the following subsections",

    "dm haloes with different masses ( above a mass scale m ) , provide biased measurements of clustering .",
    "the bias factor of mass scale m can be defined by :    @xmath215    with @xmath216 the correlation function of the dm haloes with masses above m , and @xmath217 the unbiased correlation function ( labelled simply as @xmath218 , and considered previously ) .",
    "this bias factor is independent of @xmath219 in a first order approx .",
    "we adopt the bias factor given by @xcite that takes into account ellipsoidal collapse and fits well numerical simulation measurements .    finally , we consider the radial halo mass function",
    ". this mass function , that will be given by the mass function computed with p - s theory , but considering the clustering of dm around the particular halo of mass m , can be defined as    @xmath220    now , having characterized the radial clustering of haloes about a given halo , we proceed to compute the radiation field around the halo and the power absorbed by it .      in section 2.1 of @xcite , the solution to the problem of radiative transfer , in terms of the isotropic specific intensity , in the context of a dynamic cosmological background was presented .",
    "the authors considered the radiative transfer equation ,    @xmath221    with formal solution    @xmath222    where j is the specific intensity ( in units of @xmath223 @xmath224 ) , @xmath225 is the specific emissivity , @xmath191 is the redshifted frequency of the radiation , @xmath226 is the distance travelled by a single photon of radiation per redshift interval and @xmath227 is the effective optical depth for the radiation travel .    in our case , because we are considering a model - independent wimp scenario , we do not have a specific spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the radiation resulting from the annihilation events .",
    "therefore , instead of using a frequency dependent specific intensity , we modify this formalism to consider an intensity integrated in frequency . in this case",
    ", the emissivity will be the usual power density , and we have to include an extra @xmath228 factor to account for the redshifting of the energy of all photons ( independently of the details of the sed in frequency ) .",
    "thus , we write    @xmath229    now , we give the prescriptions used for the terms included in this equation .",
    "for the line element , we use @xmath230    also , in order to take into account the radial clustering statistics about a halo of mass m , we compute the comoving distance travelled by a photon emitted at redshift @xmath231 and received at @xmath232 , as    @xmath233    where    @xmath234    now , we write the emissivity of the annihilation luminosity in the vicinity ( at a comoving distance r ) of a halo of mass @xmath84 as    @xmath235    and it already considers the correlation function and the bias of dm haloes . also , @xmath236 corresponds to the total annihilation luminosity generated by a halo , considering both the main halo and the substructure therein .",
    "now , for the effective optical depth , we use    @xmath237    where we specify @xmath238 as follows .",
    "the baryonic cross - section of a halo to the dm annihilation radiation was computed as    @xmath239    where @xmath240 is the fraction of baryons by mass , @xmath241 is the primordial abundance of he by mass and @xmath242 is the thompson cross - section .",
    "this corresponds to considering the total cross section of a dm halo as the number of electrons present in the halo times the thompson cross - section .",
    "although this prescription is crude , it is also completely model - independent .",
    "the implicit assumption here is that the photons of the radiation are energetic enough so that their frequency is higher than the frequency of typical atomic transitions in neutral hydrogen and helium ( @xmath24310 ev ) , so that we are away from the rayleigh regime and therefore bound electrons can be considered as free ; and also that they are soft enough so that their energies are small with respect to the rest - mass energy of the electrons .",
    "the first assumption is certainly true , whereas the second assumption seems dubious because the mass of an electron is on the mev scale whereas the mass of a wimp is on the gev - tev scale .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the radiation background received by the halo is not necessarily the same radiation that was obtained as a secondary product of the annihilations , because the photons have been redshifted as they travelled through the universe , and also , they could have been scattered off other haloes before . in any case ,",
    "the best reason for considering this prescription is its model - independence , and also the fact that , because for all considered halo masses and redshifts we are always in the optically thin regime ( @xmath244 ) , the absorbed external luminosity will be simply proportional to this cross - section , and therefore , the use of the thompson cross - section as the cross - section of each individual electron amounts to obtaining an upper bound on the external luminosity , because for higher energy photons , the correct klein - nishina correction factor only decreases the cross - section .",
    "finally , the specific intensity will be given by    @xmath245    note that we have already taken into account the radial dependence of the clustering statistics about a given halo of mass m. also , we have taken into account the fact that haloes of different mass have different luminosities and different biases with respect to the target halo , by performing an extra mass integration in the computation of @xmath246 .",
    "now , given the specific intensity of the radiation field , we compute the flux that is incident on the surface of the halo , and the energy that is absorbed by it . by surface ,",
    "we mean that we assign a radius to the halo that corresponds to @xmath247 .",
    "the flux incident on any surface element of the halo will be given by    @xmath248    where in this case , @xmath249 corresponds to the solid angle of the half - sphere , because any surface element receives radiation from the entire half - space that corresponds to the outside of the halo .",
    "thus , because @xmath250 is isotropic , the flux can be written as    @xmath251    finally , the power absorbed by a halo ( our external luminosity ) will be given by    @xmath252    where @xmath43 is the radius of the halo .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath253    we see that the final result is proportional to @xmath254 , and therefore , for the reasons already discussed , it should only be considered as an upper bound on the external luminosity . also , we choose @xmath255 ,",
    "because an absorption fraction of @xmath256 means that 10% of the photons produced inside dm haloes manage to reach the igm , and therefore , this choice is somewhat similar to choosing @xmath257 for the energy injection per baryon in section 4.3 , as motivated by @xcite and @xcite , although both fractions are not directly comparable .    in figure 6 , we show our results for the external dm annihilation light - to - mass ratio ( defined as @xmath258 ) as a function of halo mass at different redshifts , considering only the @xmath131cdm cosmology , in the case of a wimp with mass @xmath5 and considering both substructure and adiabatic compression",
    ".    ) ratio of the external dm annihilation luminosity received by individual haloes , as a function of halo mass ( in the range from @xmath175 to @xmath176 @xmath177 ) .",
    "the colours of the curves correspond to different redshifts ; in particular , the dotted curve correspond to @xmath178 , the short - dashed curve correspond to @xmath179 , the dot - dashed curve correspond to @xmath180 , the triple - dot - dashed curve to @xmath181 and the long - dashed curve to @xmath182 . the curves were computed assuming a wimp mass of 1tev and considering both substructure and adiabatic compression .",
    "we also include the @xmath183 mass values for the 3 lowest redshifts in the corresponding line - styles , as in figure 3.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    in general , comparing these results with the ones obtained for the dm luminosity to mass ratio generated within a particular halo ( see figure 3a ) , one can see that the external annihilation luminosity is lower than the internal annihilation luminosity at all redshifts and that the difference is of at least 2 orders of magnitude , as in the case of @xmath179 and for masses less than @xmath259 . therefore , considering that the luminosity computed here is only an upper bound , we can conclude that the external dm annihilation luminosity is not relevant as a feedback mechanism .",
    "we can also see that the curves for the received luminosity imply an almost constant light to mass ratio at each redshift , which is reasonable considering that the halo cross - section is proportional to the number of electrons , and thus proportional to the mass .",
    "different authors have studied the effects of dm annihilations ( or decays ) on the global properties of the igm , due to their extra energy injection ( for example , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite among others ) . in this section ,",
    "we study the effects on the igm of the energy injection found on section 4.3 .",
    "we divide the section into different subsections , each corresponding to one of the different physical quantities of interest that are affected by this extra energy injection .",
    "we explain the formalism and the definition of the quantities , as well as how to compute them , in the beginning of the corresponding subsections , and then we show the results we obtained and compare them with different authors .",
    "the first two sections ( the ionization fraction and the igm temperature ) , refer to general properties of the igm , whereas the next sections have to do with the signal of this extra - heating on the 21 cm line of the hyperfine structure of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "we start , in the next subsection , with the computation of the igm ionization fraction .",
    "the ionization fraction ( @xmath260 ) is defined as the ratio of free electrons to hydrogen atoms @xmath261 . following @xcite , the variation of the ionization fraction",
    "is given by :    @xmath262,\\ ] ]    where @xmath263 and @xmath264 are the standard ionization and recombination rates per baryon , and @xmath265 is the contribution to the ionization rate due to the energy injection of dm annihilation .",
    "@xmath266 is the energy injection rate per baryon computed in section 4.3 , @xmath267 is the ionization energy of hydrogen ( 13.6 ev ) , and @xmath268 is the ionization efficiency and is given by @xmath269 ( i.e. ,",
    "if all matter is ionized , no energy is used for ionization , and if all matter is neutral , @xmath270 of the injected energy goes to ionizations ) . the factor @xmath271 , is simply a change of variables , because the differential of cosmic time @xmath272 and the redshift differential @xmath273 are related by @xmath274 .",
    "we define the dm annihilation contribution to the ionization fraction as @xmath275 , where @xmath276 is the ionization fraction in the standard scenario .",
    "it is important to mention that this standard ionization fraction is a consequence of the physics of recombination from the epoch of the last scattering surface , and is simply the relic free - electron abundance from the freeze - out of the recombination reaction .",
    "thus , the @xmath276 does not account for the reionization of the universe by poulation iii stars , that according to planck 2013 @xcite , occurred at redshift @xmath277 . with this definition of @xmath278",
    ", we have :    @xmath279    we solve this differential equation , using the @xmath276 given in figure 3 of @xcite , by the euler method , using as boundary condition that @xmath280 ( at redshift @xmath281 , as we are near the recombination epoch , the ionization fraction is near 1 and is almost entirely due to the standard cooling scenario ) .",
    "we show the obtained ionization fraction ( @xmath282 ) curves in figure 7 and in figure 8 .",
    "the first figure shows the @xmath282 curves obtained for the different dm clustering scenarios and wimp masses , but considering the clumped dm case , and with an absorption fraction of @xmath159 ( more details on the caption of the figure ) .",
    "the second figure shows the ionization fractions , assuming a wimp mass of 1tev and substructure and adiabatic compression , but for different values of the absorption fraction ( @xmath283 or @xmath284 ) , or simply not considering dm clustering at all , and using the homogeneous dm energy injection computed previously .",

    ", we also include the results obtained by mapelli , ferrara & pierpaoli ( 2006 ) for the case of the 100gev susy neutralino , taken from the bottom panel of figure 3 of the authors and we show them as thin lines .",
    "the thin solid line corresponds to @xmath288 and the thin dotted line corresponds to @xmath285 .",
    "also included is the line corresponding to @xmath286 , that indicates when the effects of popiii stars may become important.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    it can be seen from figure 7 that the ionization fraction evolves very differently from the case with no dm energy injection , as long as the dm clumpiness is considered .",
    "also , for the case of a wimp with a mass of @xmath6 , the ionization fraction can be increased up to @xmath289 at redshift zero , whereas for the other cases that consider a 1tev wimp , this partial re - ionization can only bring @xmath260 to @xmath290 at redshift zero , hence leading to a difference of one order of magnitude of the final ionization fraction .",
    "note , however , that the computation of the ionization fraction does not account for the popiii stars ( for a review , see section 4 of @xcite ) , that are thought to have re - ionized the universe around redshift @xmath291 according to the results by planck @xcite ; thus , this results are only reliable down to that redshift at most",
    ". however we use a more conservative limit of @xmath286 in the plots , to account for the fact that the formation of the first stars started earlier than this quoted redshift of reionization .",
    "note , nonetheless , that we should keep in mind that the ionization process is by no means an instantaneous process , and that this redshift corresponds only to the best fit for the six - parameter base @xmath10 model under the assumption of instantaneous reionization ( as explained in @xcite ) , but that large regions of neutral hydrogen may have still been present up to @xmath292 , with a volume filling factor of @xmath293 ( see section 5.1 of @xcite ) . also , we note that as discussed by @xcite and by @xcite , the reionization may have been caused not only by the first stars , but also by the x - ray emission from accretion onto early black holes .",
    "it can also be seen in the figure that adiabatic compression is considerably less important than wimp mass in determining the evolution of the ionization fraction , and that it becomes relevant only for @xmath294 .",
    "the case with substructure but no adiabatic compression results in @xmath295 at @xmath178 , whereas the case with adiabatic compression but no substructure is indistinguishable from the case that considers both processes . therefore , in agreement with what was mentioned in previous sections , the presence of substructure is irrelevant with respect to the presence of adiabatic compression .    from figure 8 , it can be seen that even without considering dm clumpiness , the case with a @xmath6 wimp considerably modifies the ionization fraction of the universe .",
    "it has the effect of raising the relic ionization at redshift 0 ( without accounting for stellar populations ) by a factor of @xmath296 . also , the evolution of the ionization fraction is particularly sensitive to the absorption fraction @xmath157 , such that reducing @xmath157 from @xmath297 to @xmath298 results in a completely different evolution for @xmath299 ( and in a ionization fraction at z=0 an order of magnitude lower ) .",
    "the cases with @xmath300 and no clumpiness give evolutions of the ionization fraction that are very similar to the case were no dm energy injection is present .",
    "we now consider the kinetic temperature of the igm . following @xcite ,",
    "the change in this temperature is given by :    @xmath301    @xmath302    where @xmath303 is the analogue to a thermal conductivity between the cmb and the igm , @xmath304 is the heating efficiency and is given by @xmath305 and @xmath306 is the helium fraction by mass ( taken as @xmath147 ) .",
    "it is expected ( see for example @xcite ) that the igm kinetic temperature tracks the cmb temperature at high redshifts , so we used the cmb temperature at redshift @xmath307 as the boundary condition for the igm kinetic temperature , and solved the differential equation by the euler method .",
    "the interpretation of this cooling equation is straightforward , as the first term on the right hand side corresponds to the adiabatic cooling of the igm in absence of heat exchange or energy injection , and proceeds as @xmath308 .",
    "the second term corresponds to the heat exchange between the cmb and the igm , and the third term allows for the extra heating due to the dm annihilation energy injection .",
    "we show the obtained igm kinetic temperature curves in figure 9 and in figure 10 .",
    "the first figure shows the temperatures obtained for the different dm clustering scenarios and wimp masses , but considering the clumped dm case , and with an absorption fraction of @xmath159 ( more details on the caption of the figure ) .",
    "the second figure shows the temperatures , assuming a wimp mass of 1tev and substructure and adiabatic compression , but for different values of the absorption fraction ( @xmath283 or @xmath284 ) , or simply not considering dm clustering at all , and using the homogeneous dm energy injection computed previously .",
    "line is also included.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +     line is also included.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    in can be seen on figure 9 that for all the cases that consider the clumpiness of the dm ( assuming @xmath4 ) , the cooling is very different from the standard adiabatic scenario . significant re - heating occurs in the case of a @xmath6 wimp , where the igm may be heated even to temperatures of @xmath309 by redshift zero ( although , remember that this cooling scenario does not account for energy injection due to stellar components and early black holes , and so it is reliable only down to redshift @xmath310 ) . also , adiabatic compression is more important for the cooling history than substructure , and the extra heating due to this compression can amount to almost two order of magnitude of difference by redshift zero , but the difference is relevant only for @xmath299 .    also , it can be seen on figure 10 that the absorption fraction is critical for determining the particular cooling history , and that the low - redshift heating due to dm annihilations can vary enormously with different choices for @xmath157 .",
    "it can be seen that , in general , in the cases considering adiabatic compression , the igm kinetic temperature reaches a quasi - stationary state , and the final temperature attained is almost proportional to the absorption fraction .",
    "we also include the results for the ionization fraction and igm kinetic temperature obtained by @xcite , in order to compare them with our results .",
    "it can be seen that for the cases with no dm clumpiness , we reproduce the results obtained by the authors . also , the boost they considered in the cross section ( for example , accounting for sommerfeld enhancement ) , has almost exactly the same effect than lowering the mass of the wimp particle .",
    "furthermore , we find significant effects not accounted for by the authors when considering the clumpiness of the dm on all its levels , but only at @xmath311 for 1tev wimp or at @xmath312 for 10gev wimp .",
    "we now study the 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen , and how it is modified by dm annihilation .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite in the explanation of the physics and the processes involved , and refer the reader to the above papers for further details .",
    "the 21 cm line corresponds to the transition energy between the singlet and triplet hyperfine levels ( @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath313 , @xmath315 ) of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen is defined as the temperature that relates the populations of singlet and triplet states :    @xmath316    where @xmath317 is the spin temperature , @xmath318 is the equivalent temperature of the 21 cm transition ( corresponding to @xmath319 , where @xmath320 ) , @xmath321 is the triplet state occupation number , @xmath322 is the singlet state occupation number and the factor of @xmath323 is the degeneracy of the triplet state ( i.e. , 3 ) .    in general , the spin temperature is a weighted average of the igm kinetic temperature and the cmb temperature . in absence of additional heating mechanisms , both the igm kinetic temperature and the spin temperature",
    "are coupled to the cmb at high redshifts ( @xmath324 ) , whereas at lower redshifts , the igm cools faster than the cmb .",
    "thus , the spin temperature will be lower than the cmb and the igm will be visible in 21 cm absorption .",
    "there are two main mechanisms that couple the spin temperature and the kinetic temperature : spin exchange collisions and ly - alpha pumping ( also called the wouthuysen - field ( w - f ) effect @xcite ) .",
    "spin exchange collisions correspond to the collisions of neutral hydrogen ( responsible for the 21 cm line ) with other neutral hydrogen atoms , with electrons or with protons .",
    "these collisions will tend to thermalize the populations of both levels ( singlet and triplet ) to the kinetic temperature of the igm , and thus will couple @xmath317 with @xmath325 .",
    "lyman - alpha pumping , on the other hand , corresponds to the mixing ( and thus thermalisation ) of the singlet and triplet levels by lyman - alpha transitions ( from energy levels 1 to 2 and vice - versa ) to the 2p level .",
    "therefore , the mixing of hyperfine states through the w - f effect will depend on the intensity of the lyman - alpha photon field , which in turn will depend on the kinetic temperature of the igm and on the direct energy injection due to dm wimps .",
    "thus , the w - f will also couple @xmath317 with @xmath325 .    at low redshift ( @xmath153 ) , the igm density is sufficiently rarefied so as to make the spin exchange collisions too improbable , and thus @xmath317 will tend to follow the temperature of the cmb again .    as the mechanisms coupling @xmath317 and @xmath326 depend on the ionization fraction @xmath260 , and the dm energy injection rate per baryon @xmath266 , it is expected that the presence of an annihilating wimp will alter the evolution of @xmath317 with redshift , and thus , the detection of this signal may help to discriminate between different wimp scenarios .",
    "the spin temperature at redshift z can be computed as :    @xmath327    where @xmath328 is the w - f coupling , and @xmath329 is the collisional coupling to the igm temperature .",
    "the coupling coefficients can be computed as :    @xmath330    and    @xmath331    where @xmath332 is the spontaneous emission coefficient for the transition , and @xmath333 and @xmath334 are the radiative and collisional transition coefficients respectively ( they are rates , with units of @xmath335 $ ] ) .",
    "the collisional transition coefficient is given by :    @xmath336    where @xmath337 and @xmath338 are the neutral hydrogen number density and the free electron number density respectively , and @xmath339 and @xmath340 are the specific ( one particle ) transition coefficients for collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms and electrons respectively .",
    "we have neglected the contribution due to collisions with protons , following @xcite .",
    "the number densities @xmath338 and @xmath337 are easily obtained in terms of the above - defined ionization fraction @xmath260 , the hydrogen and helium abundances by number ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) and the baryonic density of the universe @xmath341 , also defined previously .",

    ", we also include the results obtained by cumberbatch , lattanzi & silk ( 2010 ) for the case of susy models with a nfw density profile , taken from the upper panel of figure 10 of the authors , and we show them as thin lines .",
    "the line - styles for the thin curves correspond to dot - dashed for model 4 , short - dashed for model 2 , long - dashed for model 3 and dotted for model1 .",
    "we refer the reader to table i of the authors for a description of the different models .",
    "we also include the detectability limits here discussed , corresponding to the @xmath297 @xmath383 threshold and to the @xmath286 ( popiii stars ) and @xmath384 ( minimum frequency of @xmath385 @xmath386 ) limits.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    it can be seen , from figure 11 , that the most important factor that determines the @xmath387 signal is the wimp mass . for a @xmath6 wimp ,",
    "the signal is around @xmath388 at redshift 100 , very much above the @xmath389 sensitivity of current and future instruments quoted by @xcite .",
    "however , the authors also mention that current and future radio frequency arrays will probe up to a minimum frequency of @xmath9 , thus corresponding to a 21 cm emission at @xmath390 .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity window should be considered as @xmath391 , and also @xmath392 .",
    "the @xmath6 case is barely within this window , in the range of @xmath231 between @xmath393 and @xmath394 ( with an amplitude of @xmath387 that varies from @xmath395 to @xmath396 ) and for @xmath310 ( with an amplitude of @xmath397 ) . for the cases with a wimp mass of @xmath5 , the corresponding curves coincide in the plot , and",
    "thus , for the @xmath387 signal , only the mass of the wimp is relevant .",
    "also , in all the @xmath5 cases , the signal is within the detectability window only for @xmath398 , and only at the @xmath399 level , and therefore , it is unlikely to be distinguishable from the backgrounds .",
    "it can be seen in figure 12 , that even in the no - clumpiness case , a wimp with mass of @xmath6 would still be inside the sensitivity window mentioned before , due to the broad peak in the signal around @xmath400 and the secondary peak around @xmath401 .",
    "also , for the cases with @xmath5 wimp but non - maximal @xmath157 or no clumpiness , the signal would be very similar to the @xmath4 case , but with a slightly reduced amplitude , and would just barely fall in the sensitivity window ( at @xmath402 ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , as was mentioned above , the sensitivity window here considered is only nominal , because the foreground extraction and the de - contamination of the signal may be difficult .",
    "we also present in figure 11 and figure 12 the @xmath403 curves obtained by @xcite and compare them with the results that we obtain .",
    "it can be seen from the comparison between the curves given by the authors and ours , that the dynamical range of the values for the obtained @xmath403 curves are similar , but that the particular shapes of the curves are different .",
    "this may be because the authors use an analytic approximation to @xmath404 , compute @xmath157 self - consistently and assume a pure power - law shape for the substructure , without considering time evolution of substructures within particular haloes , and so their curves will be more soft , having less numerical noise from the integration and equation solving procedures .",
    "also , all our curves are peaked around @xmath405 ( with a secondary peak in the cases with @xmath6 wimps ) , whereas the results from the authors are peaked around @xmath406 .",
    "in this paper , we develop formalisms for calculating the generated and received dm self annihilation luminosity of individual halos , as well as the energy injection rate per baryon in the universe as a whole , accounting for the clustering of the dm at all scales but without considering sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "we also compute the effects on the igm and on the 21 cm signal of this extra energy injection due to the dm .",
    "it is important to mention that we take a numeric approach for performing the calculations of the barionic clumpiness , instead of the analytic approach used by previous authors . also , we incorporate adiabatic compression , which had not been done so far .",
    "the prescriptions used for the computations are the primordial power spectrum , the transfer function , the window function , the substructure mass function and its corresponding time evolution , the computation of the nfw parameters as a function of halo mass and redshift and the computation of the adiabatically compressed density profile for each halo , considering the critical mass criteria as given by @xcite .",
    "we now give some general conclusions about the results obtained .",
    "as discussed in section 4.2 , the luminosity generated within individual halos , considering @xmath5 wimps , is not enough to self - regulate the star formation of the halo , and thus , it can not contribute significantly to the standard feedback mechanisms ( agn feedback for haloes of mass greater than @xmath407 and sne feedback for haloes of mass smaller than @xmath408 ) .",
    "dm clustering in general is determinant in order to assess the effects of dm annihilation on the igm and for computing the energy injection per baryon .",
    "evidence of this are the clumpiness factors obtained in section 4.4 , which can be in excess of @xmath207 at redshift zero ( the energy injection rate is thus boosted by this factor with respect to the case of a perfectly smooth universe ) .",
    "also , in favour of the importance of clustering are the results obtained for the ionization fraction @xmath282 and the igm kinetic temperature @xmath409 discussed in section 6.1 and section 6.2 , where it is clearly seen that , for the cases assuming a perfectly homogeneous universe , and for a wimp mass of @xmath5 , the obtained evolutions of these quantities are virtually indistinguishable from the standard case with no energy injection due to dm .",
    "for example , not accounting for substructure , led @xcite to conclude that the effects of a heavy ( @xmath23 ) neutralino on the igm were negligible , and it was shown by @xcite that this may not be the case by accounting for the clustering of dm .",
    "however , we found that even for our maximally clustered case ( adiabatic compression plus substructure ) , for a 1tev wimp , the deviations with respect to the smooth case only become significant at @xmath410 .",
    "we find that the presence of annihilating and clumped dm may result in significant deviations in the evolutions of the inferred temperature and ionization fraction for @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in the scenario that takes into account the clustering of dm at all levels , as well as the adiabatic compression , a @xmath5 wimp with thermal relic annihilation cross - section may increase the temperature of the igm to the @xmath411 level , or contribute to the ionization fraction rising it to a value of @xmath412 at redshift zero ( not considering popiii stars ) .",
    "we conclude that although the dm annihilation can have a significant impact on the inferred properties of the igm , it can not be regarded as an alternative reionization scenario , because even in the case of a @xmath6 wimp ( with lower mass than favoured by direct and indirect detections and accelerator constraints ) , the value of @xmath260 at @xmath413 does not rise over 0.03 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained by @xcite , where for all the different models of decaying or annihilating dm considered by the authors , they obtained values of @xmath260 at @xmath413 of at most 0.3 ( for the case of axino - type light dark matter with a mass of @xmath414 and without considering popiii stars ) .",
    "we note however that among the models that they considered , only the neutralino dm model is comparable to our results for the no clumpiness case .",
    "both results are in good agreement , however we do not use exactly the same mass as they do , and we do not consider cross - section enhancement .",
    "varying the mass of the wimp and considering a constant enhancement in cross - section can have enormous effects on the properties of the igm as the dm energy injection rate scales as @xmath415 ( disregarding the variation in the presence of substructure when changing @xmath110 due to free - streaming effects ) .    about the detectability of the @xmath416 @xmath387 signal , defined as the absolute value of the difference of the differential brightness temperatures in 21 cm with and without dm energy injection ( see section 6.5 )",
    ", we can conclude considering the results that we obtain that , according to the sensitivity limits mentioned by @xcite , and considering a maximal absorption fraction @xmath4 , a thermal relic wimp with mass of @xmath5 is not likely to be detected from the global signal alone ( see section 6.5 ) .",
    "a lower mass wimp may be detectable , although a mass on the order of @xmath25 or lower is not favoured by neither accelerator constraints ( see section 2.3 ) , nor by direct and indirect detection searches ( see section 4.6 ) . comparing with the results obtained by @xcite",
    ", we notice that for their different susy neutralino models , the authors obtain @xmath387 curves that cover a similar dynamic range than our curves .",
    "however , in the redshift range of @xmath417 that is interesting for detection , they tend to predict a stronger signal than our @xmath5 and @xmath6 wimp models , because their curves are centred around @xmath418 , whereas ours are centred around @xmath419 .",
    "this also applies to our @xmath420 case , to which we should compare their results to ( because the authors already incorporate an explicit @xmath157 treatment and they have values @xmath421 in that redshift range ; see their figure 12 and figure 13 ) .",
    "note that the authors use a lower mass @xmath422 wimp , but they obtain the energy and number of photons and electron - positron pairs that result from the cascades produced by the primary products of the annihilation and use these in order to compute @xmath157 . according to their results ,",
    "all of their susy models would be in principle detectable , except for their model 4 ( see their table 1 for more details ) .    finally , as future work , we should mention that it is in principle possible to use the dm annihilation luminosity received by a halo ( section 5 ) , together with the luminosity generated by the halo itself ( section 4.2 ) , in order to compute the effects that the extra energy injection will have on the standard physical processes that take place in the barionic component of the halo ( intra cluster medium or icm in the case of galaxy cluster - sized haloes ) , like for example its neutral hydrogen abundance , bremsstrahlung luminosity , etc ... also , being able to compute the ionization fractions and temperatures of individual haloes at high redshifts , as well as their spatial clustering , may provide a way of computing the angular fluctuations of the differential brightness temperature ( @xmath3 ) signal for different wimp scenarios , in order to have another test besides the predicted global signal ( for example , @xcite study this , but without considering substructure or adiabatic compression ) .",
