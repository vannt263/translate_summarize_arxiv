    "heat conduction in low - dimensional systems has recently become the subject of a large number of theoretical and experimental studies@xcite .",
    "the theoretical interest in this field lies in the rapid progress in probing and manipulating thermal properties of nanoscale systems , which unveils the possibility of designing thermal devices with optimized performance at the atomic scale .",
    "as we all know , devices that control the transport of electrons , such as the electrical diode and transistor , have been extensively studied and led to the widespread applications in modern electronics .",
    "however , it is far less studied for their thermal counterparts as to control the transport of phonons ( heat flux ) , possibly by reason that phonons are more difficult to control than electrons .",
    "recently , it has been revealed by theoretical studies in model systems that , such as electrons and photons , phonons can also perform interesting function , which shed light on the possible designs of thermal devices@xcite . the nonlinear systems with structural asymmetry",
    "were predicted to exhibit thermal rectification@xcite , which has triggered model designs of various types of thermal devices .",
    "remarkably , a thermal rectifier has been experimentally realized by using gradual mass - loaded carbon and boron nitride nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models of thermal transistors @xcite , thermal logic gates @xcite , and thermal memory@xcite are also proposed .",
    "most of these studies are relevant to heat conduction in the nonlinear response regime , where the counterintuitive phenomenon of ndtr may be observed and plays an important role in the operation of those devices .",
    "ndtr refers to the phenomenon where the resulting heat flux decreases as the applied temperature difference ( or gradient ) increases .",
    "usually , the studies on ndtr have been on the models with structural inhomogeneity , such as the two - segment frenkel - kontorova model @xcite , the weakly coupled two - segment @xmath0 model @xcite , and the anharmonic graded mass model @xcite . however , structural asymmetry is not a necessary condition for ndtr and it can also occur in absolutely symmetric structures@xcite .",
    "recently , hu and coworkers @xcite have found from molecular dynamics simulations that ndtr is possible in both asymmetric and symmetric gnrs .",
    "gnrs may be good candidate martials for designing thermal devices such as thermal transistors , thermal logic gates , and thermal memory .",
    "therefore , it very necessary to find in which kind of gnrs ndtr can occur .",
    "recent works @xcite have shown that dimension crossover can strongly affect heat transport in gnrs .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to find dimension dependence of ndtr in gnrs . in this paper",
    ", we focus on finding how the dimension of gnrs affects the appearance of ndtr by using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method .",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed and applied to explain and predict the thermal properties of graphene . the experiments and theories",
    "@xcite show that the carrier density of non - doped graphene is relatively low , the phonon contribution overwhelms the electronic one by orders of magnitude and the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity ( wiedemann- franz law ) is negligible .",
    "the thermal conductivity of graphene is thus dominated by phonon transport , namely diffusive conduction at high temperature and ballistic conduction at sufficiently low temperature . therefore ,",
    "classical molecular dynamics is widely used in calculating the thermal conductivities of gnrs .     and @xmath1 is varied.,height=113 ]    in this paper , we study thermal transport of gnrs shown in fig . 1 by using classical molecular dynamics .",
    "for a ribbon , its length @xmath2 is greater than its width @xmath3 , which in turn is larger than the effective thickness @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) . in the simulations , we have used the tersoff - brenner potential @xcite for carbon - carbon interaction in the intra - plane . for multiple - layer gnrs",

    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 and the detailed information of @xmath17 are given in brenner s reference @xcite .",
    "the form of the lennard - jones potential is shown as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the attractive and repulsive constants , respectively .",

    ".    therefore , the total potential between a pair of atoms is @xmath29 and the force between two atoms can be found by taking the gradient of the potential function with respect to their distance : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gradient operator .",
    "then , the net force on a particular atom can be found by summing the forces due to all other atoms in the system , @xmath32    we place atoms at the two ends of gnrs in the thermostats with temperatures @xmath33 ( left end ) and @xmath1 ( right end ) shown in fig .",

    "@xmath45 is the number of atoms in the thermostat , @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath47 is the mass of the carbon atom . the atoms between the two thermostats are obeying the newton s law motion , @xmath48 where @xmath9 runs over all the atoms between the two thermostats .    the velocity verlet method is employed to integrate the equations ( 1 - 7 ) of motion at the given initial positions and velocities of the all atoms . the time step of @xmath49 , and the simulation runs for @xmath50 time steps giving a total molecular dynamics time of @xmath51 .",
    "the statistic average of interesting quantities start from half of the total time , i.e. , @xmath52 time steps are used to relax the system to a stationary state .",
    "we set the relaxation time @xmath53 .",
    "the distance between the neighbor layers is @xmath54 and the bond length of carbon - carbon is @xmath55 . in order to avoid the spurious global rotation of gnrs in the simulations ,",
    "we use the fixed boundary conditions for the two ends along the length of gnrs .    the heat bath acts on the atom with a force @xmath56 , thus the power of heat bath is @xmath57 , which can also be regarded as the heat flux coming out of the high temperature heat bath and injecting into the low temperature heat bath .",
    "the total heat flux ( thermal current ) from the heat bath to the system can be obtained @xcite by @xmath58=-3\\gamma nk_{b}t(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath8 runs over all the atoms in the thermostat .",
    "because thermal transport strongly depends on the phonon density of states ( pdos ) which is the number of vibrational states per unit frequency , it is necessary to study the full and transversal edge pdos of the system to understand the appearance of ndtr .",
    "the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function is the pdos @xcite .",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the velocity vector of the @xmath9th atom , and the angle brackets denote an average over all atoms and all time windows .",

    "similarly , full pdos is calculated from eq .",
    "( 9 ) where @xmath9 runs all the atoms of the gnrs .",
    "for the convenience of discussion on ndtr , thermal current can be written as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the effective thermal conductivity which depends on @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is the temperature difference and @xmath66 is the average temperature .",
    "obviously , ndtr may occur only when the effective thermal conductivity @xmath67 decreases remarkably as @xmath64 increases .     as a function of the temperature difference @xmath64 for both armchair and zigzag gnrs .",

    "when @xmath72 is not large , @xmath73 and @xmath64 are proportional to each other and the system is within the linear response regime .",
    "but for large values of @xmath64 , the system enters the nonlinear response regime , where ndtr may occur .",
    "since the results from zigzag gnrs are qualitatively similar to that from armchair gnrs , we mainly study dimension dependence of ndtr in armchair gnrs .",
    "obviously , the phenomena of ndtr is not caused by the asymmetry , since gnrs is absolutely symmetric .",
    "the appearance of ndtr in gnrs can be explained by the transversal edge effects of gnrs@xcite . from eq .",
    "( 9 ) we can obtain the transversal edge pdos shown in fig .",
    "it is found that there are some strong low - frequency peaks which shows the existence of the edge - localized phonon modes .",
    "the transversal edge of gnrs will reduce the effective thermal conductivity @xmath62 owing to the appearance of the edge - localized phonon modes .",
    "the edge - localized phonons can interact with other low energy phonons and thus reduce the phonons mean free paths , which reduces the effective thermal conductivity @xmath62 . when the average temperature increases ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) , the heights of the low - frequency peaks decrease and the peaks become not significant gradually . in other words ,",
    "the number of edge - localized phonon modes increases as the average temperature decreases .",

    "when the width @xmath3 is very small , e.g. , @xmath80 , no ndtr can be observed .",
    "this can be understood as follows : gnrs with very small width reduces to one - dimensional atom chain@xcite without on - site potentials , for example fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) chain , in this kind of chain , thermal current always increases with the applied temperature difference@xcite .",
    "therefore , ndtr can not occur for very narrow gnrs ( one dimension ) .",

    "for example , ndtr almost disappears for @xmath96 .",
    "we thus suggest that ndtr will eventually disappear if the length exceeds some critical value .",
    "obviously , when the length increases so that the length is much larger than the width ( @xmath97 ) , gnrs becomes from two - dimensional system to one - dimensional system and gnrs reduces to one - dimensional atom chain without on - site potential , where no ndtr can be found @xcite .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the thermal transport of gnrs in the nonlinear response regime from one dimension to three dimensions .",
