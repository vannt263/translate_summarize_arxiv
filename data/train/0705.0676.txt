    "the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite has been extensively used as a prototype for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and related issues .",
    "this is due to the fact that both models share some common features such as asymptotic freedom and chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) .",
    "for this reason the gn model is useful as a toy model to test different techniques that can be ultimately used to tackle problems related to qcd phase transitions . at the same time , in the condensed matter physics domain , the two ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional gn model ( gn2d ) has been associated to polymers @xcite including unidimensional molecules such as polyacetylene @xcite , while the three ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional version ( gn3d ) has been related to planar superconductors @xcite .",
    "the applications concerning phase transitions within the gn model are commonly carried out in the finite temperature and/or finite density domain where non - perturbative techniques must be employed . in these applications",
    "the most commonly used analytical non - perturbative technique is the @xmath2 expansion @xcite where , for the gn model , @xmath1 represents the number of fermionic species ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "in general , this expansion is considered only at the leading order in what is known as the large-@xmath1 approximation .    in the large-@xmath1 approximation",
    "there are fundamental differences between the gn2d and gn3d models that are worth recalling . in dimensions",
    "@xmath3 one observes chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) occurring via a phase transition of the second kind for high temperature ( @xmath4 ) and small chemical potential ( @xmath5 ) values , while for low @xmath4 and high @xmath5 the transition is of the first kind @xcite .",
    "one finds a tricritical point in the @xmath6 plane separating the second order transition line from the first order one , while metastable lines accompany the first order transition @xcite . in the @xmath7 plane ( @xmath8 being the pressure and @xmath9 the density )",
    "one finds a phase diagram similar to the one generated by a van der waals liquid so that the csb region corresponds to the `` gas '' phase while the csr region corresponds to the `` liquid '' phase .",
    "it then follows that the first order transition allows for the appearance of a ( mixed ) liquid - gas phase . the chiral ( dynamical ) symmetry breaking happening in the massless gn2d with discrete symmetry at finite temperature , however , must be seen with care , since it is an artifact of the large-@xmath1 approximation",
    "this is a consequence of well - known no - go theorems concerning that there should be no discrete symmetry breaking in one - space dimension @xcite . in this case",
    "the system s vacuum manifold allows for the appearance of kink  anti - kink configurations that are unsuppressed at any finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the system becomes segmented into regions of alternating signs of the order parameter whose net average value becomes zero . at leading order , the @xmath2 approximation misses this effect because the energy per kink goes to infinity as @xmath10 , while the contribution from the kinks has the form @xmath11 .",
    "the large-@xmath1 results for the gn model in 2 + 1 dimensions are rather different @xcite .",
    "first of all , as far a discrete chiral symmetry is concerned , the no - go theorem of one - space dimensions no longer applies ( though now , in two - space dimensions , the no - go theorem applies to the non - existence of a continuous broken symmetry at any finite temperature ) .",
    "the gn3d phase diagram produced by the large-@xmath1 approximation shows that the csb / csr transition is of the second kind everywhere except at @xmath12 , where it happens to be of the first kind . within this approximation",
    ", there are no tricritical points lying in the @xmath6 plane and no liquid - gas phase .",
    "the model behaves more like a planar superconductor with the transition csb / csr happening as a superconducting / normal one @xcite .",
    "later , kogut and strouthos have used lattice monte carlo simulations to study the gn3d at finite @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "they predicted that a tricritical point should exist at low finite values of @xmath4 , but within the numerical precision of their simulations , they were unable to give its exact location ( in earlier lattice simulations @xcite used to obtain the phase diagram for the gn3d at finite @xmath1 , some evidence for a tricritical point was also pointed out ) .",
    "no other attempts or approximations were able to improve on this situation .",
    "as far we are aware of , no evidence has been given so far for a possible chiral  liquid - gas \" kind of phase .    in an attempt to go beyond the simple large-@xmath1 approximation and in such a way that temperature and chemical potential effects could be considered in a simple approximation method ,",
    "three of the present authors @xcite have recently considered the gn2d in the linear @xmath13 expansion method ( lde ) , also known as the optimized perturbation ( opt ) .",
    "that study allowed for the inclusion of the first non trivial finite @xmath1 corrections to the complete phase diagram of the gn2d model .",
    "the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite are the derivation of analytic non - perturbative expressions , containing finite @xmath1 corrections , scalar field expectation value , critical temperature @xmath14 ( at @xmath15 ) , critical chemical potential @xmath16 ( at @xmath12 ) , as well as for the tricritical point ( at @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . in the phase diagram",
    ", the predicted csb region is reduced for finite values of @xmath1 .",
    "the opt expression for @xmath14 predicts values that are lower than the ones predicted by the large-@xmath1 approximation which , in the light of the coleman - mermin - wagner - landau theorem @xcite , can be viewed as an indication of convergence .    our recent success in treating the gn2d @xcite and the previous lattice monte carlo results on the gn3d , concerning the eventual existence of a tricritical point in the gn3d model @xcite , gave us the motivation to investigate the gn3d using the opt method to fully study its thermodynamics in order to confirm , in an analytical way , the existence of a tricritical point .",
    "the opt method is known for exactly reproducing the large-@xmath1 result for the effective potential ( or free energy ) already at the first non trivial order @xcite .",
    "the _ perturbative _ computation of higher orders brings finite @xmath1 corrections and non - perturbative results are generated upon using a variational criterion .",
    "one advantage is that at any perturbative order one has complete control over the contributions , while the eventual technical difficulties are like the ones one should encounter in a traditional perturbative computation .",
    "the convergence properties of the opt in critical problems associated to bose - einstein condensates have been proved @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some of the most accurate numerical results regarding the critical temperature for weakly interacting homogeneous bose gases have also been obtained with this method @xcite . concerning the gn3d model the results obtained in the present work include analytical equations for both @xmath14 ( at @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( at @xmath12 ) as well as for the scalar field vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath19 with finite @xmath1 corrections .",
    "contrary to the gn2d case , these values appear to be higher than the predicted large-@xmath1 values .",
    "one of our most important results concerns the location of a tricritical point at finite values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . being able to specialize to _ any _ value of @xmath1 we choose @xmath20 , which is the relevant value for qcd . in a preliminary work @xcite ,",
    "we already have shown that the unstable region in the @xmath6 plane , which corresponds to the region inside the metastable lines that accompany the first order transition line , is rather small , thus explaining the difficulty in observing and locating the tricritical point in previous works . here",
    "we extend that work and , from the ( landau ) free energy , or effective potential , we obtain other relevant thermodynamical quantities such as the thermodynamical potential , pressure , density , etc .",
    "this allows us to obtain the phase diagram in the intuitively more accessible @xmath7 plane and that shows how important are the finite @xmath1 corrections in the gn3d .",
    "in fact , these corrections produce a phase diagram that is like a van der waals liquid and _ contrary _ to the large-@xmath1 predictions , we show that the model can display a mixed  liquid - gas \" phase , which was previously unknown to exist .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section we present the gn model . in sec .",
    "iii we present the opt method and the interpolated gn model , evaluating the effective potential in this non - perturbative scheme .",
    "we show that , already at leading order , our results go beyond the known large-@xmath1 results . in sec .",
    "iv we present the optimized results obtained from the effective potential at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the dynamically generated fermion mass that we here associate with the auxiliar scalar field vacuum expectation value , the critical temperature and critical chemical potential for chiral symmetry restoration are evaluated and explicit analytical expressions for these quantities are obtained . in this same section",
    "we also discuss the complete phase diagram for the gn model in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 plane that then shows the presence of a tricritical point joining the lines of second order and first order chiral phase transitions , which we are able to locate precisely . in sec .",
    "v we present other relevant thermodynamical quantities and show explicitly the existence of a mixed chiral symmetry restored / broken phase , the analogous of a liquid - gas phase in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "the entropy , latent heat , and other important quantities are also evaluated . in sec .",

    "is performed over the fermion fields satisfying the anti - periodic boundary condition in euclidean time : @xmath37 .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the implementation of the opt method within the gn model . usually , when employing this approximation one starts by performing a linear interpolation on the original model in terms of a ficticious parameter @xmath13 ( used only for bookkeeping purposes ) , which allows for further expansions . according to this opt interpolation prescription @xcite ( for",
    "a long , but far from complete list of references on the method , see @xcite ) the deformed four fermion theory reads @xcite    @xmath38    so , that at @xmath39 we have a theory of free fermions while at @xmath40 the original theory is reproduced .",
    "now , the introduction of an auxiliary scalar field @xmath41 can be achieved by adding the quadratic term ,    @xmath42    to @xmath43 .",
    "we are then led to the interpolated model    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the part of lagrangian density containing the necessary counterterms for renormalization , whose coefficients are allowed to be @xmath13 and @xmath46 dependent @xcite . as it is well known",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional gn model is not renormalizable in the usual perturbative expansion , but is renormalizable in the @xmath2 expansion @xcite , which has the property of modifying non - perturbatively the usual behavior under power counting .",
    "though our renormalization procedure in the opt expansion is more similar to a perturbative renormalization , this is not a real obstacle for our analysis . on general grounds",
    "it is always possible to calculate physical quantities in a non - renormalizable model , at the price of introducing new counterterms at successive orders , which simply means that the sensitivity to an implicit cutoff of the model is expected to be more pronounced than in a renormalizable theory @xcite .",
    "such a procedure is commonly and successfully applied in many effective theories , like e.g. typically in chiral perturbation theory ( for a recent review of chiral perturbation theory with emphasize on the renormalization procedure see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , concretely in our case , at first order of the opt expansion all the relevant quantities are actually finite ( when using dimensional regularization as we do here ) , thus completely unambiguous .",
    "next , at second order , that we also investigate to some extent in this paper , it turns out , that the only potentially non - renormalizable contributions to the effective potential actually vanish , such that only standard ( i.e. mass , wave - function , etc ) counterterms are necessary to cancel the divergences .",
