    "wireless networks where nodes are arranged regularly in a lattice have advantages in terms of coverage , for example in sensor networks or for cellular base stations , and in terms of interference , since it is much easier to devise good channel access schemes than in networks where nodes are randomly deployed or mobile . despite this advantage , relatively little work has focused on the interference characterization in such networks . furthermore , interference results for lattices also provide bounds on optimally scheduled general wireless networks , since the goal of scheduling is to maximize the spacing between a receiver and its interfering transmitters , while maintaining a certain density of transmitters .    in this context , this paper makes three contributions :    * we introduce general bounding techniques for the interference in lattice networks .",
    "* we apply these bounds to _ transmitter - centric _ macs ( mac schemes that schedule transmitters without considering the location of their respective receivers , such as csma - type scheduling without rts / cts ) . in this case",
    ", transmitters form a lattice , but interference has to be measured at the receiver , where the interference is necessarily larger than if it were measured at the location of the desired transmitter .",
    "the transmitter - receiver distance @xmath0 results in _ excess interference_.",
    "we show that quadratic approximations of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the interference at the desired transmitter and @xmath3 is the excess interference due to the offset of the receiver , are highly accurate for small @xmath0 .",
    "these results are relevant for well scheduled wireless networks with arbitrary node distribution . * for networks where all nodes form a lattice , we analyze and compare the interference of different tdma schedulers , and we provide schemes that are very close to optimum ( if not optimum ) for one - dimensional , square and triangular networks . in the one - dimensional case",
    ", we also provide results on the achievable rate and the transport capacity .",
    "while a growing body of work studies interference in random networks ( see , , @xcite and references therein ) , only few papers have addressed the issue of interference in lattice networks . in @xcite , bounds on the interference in triangular networks were derived using a relatively crude upper bound on the riemann zeta function that is within 25% of the true value for the range of @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "we will derive a much tighter bound that is within 1.3% .",
    "a tdma scheduling scheme for square lattices that is optimum for the case where the density of concurrent transmitters is @xmath6 is suggested in @xcite .",
    "here , we provide near - optimum scheduling schemes for any density @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the interference distribution in one - dimensional networks with rayleigh fading is analyzed in @xcite for the case where all nodes transmit , and @xcite derives outage results an throughput - optimum tdma schedulers for the same type of network .",
    "finally , the single - hop throughput for two - dimensional lattice networks with rayleigh fading is approximated in @xcite . for non - fading channels",
    ", @xcite provides throughput results for general tdma schemes in two - dimensional lattice networks .",
    "the interference is expressed using complicated infinite double sums ( that are evaluated numerically ) , for which we will present tight bounds .",
    "the network models in this paper are entirely deterministic , although , of course , the interference results derived correspond to the expected interference in fading channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the bounding techniques ( section ii ) , followed by three application sections that discuss one - dimensional networks ( section iii ) , square lattice networks ( section iv ) , and triangular networks ( section v ) . conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic techniques that will be used to bound the interference .",

    "important cases include the square integer and the triangular lattice in two dimensions , both with nearest - neighbor distance @xmath14 : @xmath15 the lattice @xmath16 has the properties that it includes the origin @xmath17 and that each lattice point is centered in its voronoi cell , , if @xmath18 is the voronoi cell of lattice point @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a uniformly randomly distributed random variable on @xmath18 , then @xmath21 .",
    "the volume of each voronoi cell is @xmath22 , and the density of the lattice is @xmath23 ( points per unit volume ) .",

    "then the interference at point @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the path loss function , assumed monotonically decreasing and isotropic , , there exists a function @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the standard euclidean norm .",
    "further assume that @xmath31 as @xmath32 ( otherwise the interference is infinite ) and that @xmath33 has a _ convex tail _ , , there is a finite radius , defined as @xmath34 all commonly and rarely used path loss functions satisfy these properties .",
    "the origin is assumed to be the desired transmitter , so it does not contribute to the interference .",
    "the distance @xmath35 is restricted to values that ensure that @xmath25 is not too close to an interferer , , @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the column vectors that constitute @xmath39 .    the first theorem exploits the tail convexity of the path loss function to yield an upper bound on the interference .",

    "for the case where the path loss law @xmath59 has a power law tail with exponent @xmath63 , the integral evaluates to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the lower integration bound .",
    "the reason why @xmath66 is restricted to the set @xmath67 is that if @xmath66 is not the smallest distance of a voronoi cell , then @xmath66 can always be increased to the next larger smallest distance without changing the set over which the sum is taken , thereby yielding a better bound . in other words , for any set @xmath42 chosen in theorem [ thm : voronoi ] , the corresponding @xmath66 here should be the largest radius such that @xmath68 does not overlap with any of the voronoi cells of the points in @xmath42 .",
    "the integral in can be interpreted as the mean interference stemming from a poisson point process of intensity @xmath69 . as one would expect , outside of a certain radius from the origin , only the intensity of the point process matters , rather than its higher - order statistics ( such as second - moment measures ) .",

    "by judicious application of jensen s inequality , tight and general upper and lower bounds on the interference in lattice networks can be calculated .",
    "the lower bounding technique yields expressions involving the riemann zeta function , which , in turn , can be tightly lower bounded in closed - form ( lemma [ lem : zeta ] ) .    when transmitters are arranged in a lattice , but their receivers are not , such as in a cellular downlink scenario or when a mac scheme focuses on separating the transmitters , the interference needs to be characterized at some distance @xmath0 from the desired transmitter .",
    "we have introduced a simple yet effective quadratic approximation that shows how the interference increases with growing link distance @xmath0 . in terms of the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ,",
