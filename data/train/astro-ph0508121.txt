    "it is well established that massive stars form in dense cores within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , while low - mass stars form both in dark clouds and gmcs .",
    "the formation process of an isolated low - mass star is fairly well understood ; the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud into a protostellar core and the subsequent accretion via a circumstellar disk surrounded by an infalling envelope ( e.g. , shu , adams , & lizano 1987 and references therein ) , followed by the dissipation of momentum into its surroundings through molecular outflows ( lada 1985 ; fukui et al .  1986 , 1993 ; fukui 1989 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the current paradigm is now being tested by observations , and it has become clear that some modifications to the details of protostellar formation are needed ( e.g. , andr et al .  1993 ; onishi et al .  1996 , 1998 ; evans 1999 and references therein ) .    concerning massive star formation ,",
    "an empirical scenario of the later stages of the massive star formation process has been presented ( e.g. , kurtz 2000 and references therein ) ; dense ( @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath17 ) , compact ( @xmath26 0.1 pc ) , and hot ( @xmath27 100 k ) regions called hot cores are formed in gmcs , then the uv radiation from newly formed stars within hot cores ionizes the surrounding material to produce ultra - compact h  ii regions ( uchiis ) , and finally the central stars become visible , such as the trapezium cluster in orion . on the contrary ,",
    "evolution before the formation of hot cores remains unclear , although some attempts to detect sources at the earliest stages of massive star formation have been made ; surveys toward iras point sources and maser sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed the presence of the dense , compact , and massive cores ( density @xmath27 10@xmath28 @xmath17 , temperature @xmath27 100 k , luminosity @xmath27 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ) sometimes called high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of which are not accompanied by uchiis . although sources without uchiis may be younger than the rest , the presence of iras point sources and maser sources themselves stongly indicates that stars are already formed within hmpos .",
    "it is quite natural to suppose that dense , compact , massive , _ starless _ cores ( density @xmath24 10@xmath28 @xmath17 , size @xmath26 1.0 pc , mass @xmath27 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) are the precursors of the hmpos and hot cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "systematic studies of these massive _ starless _ cores had not been carried out until recently , due to the difficulty in selecting targets from the existing database .",
    "it is to be noted that large - scale surveys for possible candidates for massive _ starless _ cores ( density @xmath24 10@xmath18 @xmath17 ) have already been made ; e.g. , @xcite surveyed the l1630 cloud ( orion b ) in cs ( @xmath4 = 21 ) . the importance of the study of _ starless _ cores has been revealed in a series of unbiased surveys for dense cores in low - mass star - forming regions , especially from a viewpoint of setting observational constraints on the evolutional time scales of the theoretical model @xcite .",
    "the same is expected for the massive star forming regions and thus unbiased surveys for massive dense cores in massive star - forming regions are also crucial .",
    "one of the most important tasks in the study of massive star formation at the moment is to identify massive dense cores which have not yet experienced massive - star formation but are capable of future massive - star formation .",
    "high - resolution observations of these cores will give observational constraints on the initial phases of the evolutional model of a massive star ; massive stars are formed by direct accretion onto a central protostar through an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which is simple extension of low - mass star formation , or by collisions of intermediate - mass protostars within a young cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , such observations are the only method to reveal the initial conditions of massive star forming cores , since the properties of the cores change rapidly soon after the formation of massive stars due to strong uv radiation and stellar winds .",
    "surveys for hot cores and hmpos toward iras point sources and maser sources are , however , biased toward regions which have experienced star formation , and thus it is not possible to obtain information on the initial conditions of the massive star forming cores",
    ". therefore studies of dense cores which have not yet experienced massive - star formation are awaited .",
    "unbiased surveys for massive dense cores over entire gmcs in molecular lines as well as in the far - infrared and ( sub-)millimeter continuum may be the most effective methods to search for massive _ starless _ cores which are capable of future massive - star formation .",
    "far - ir and submillimeter / millimeter continuum observations are best suited to detect radiation from the dust in _ starless _ cores , since the radiation from cold dust ( @xmath29 @xmath26 20 k ) peaks at far - ir ( @xmath30 150 @xmath31 m ) wavelengths with gradual decrease toward longer wavelengths .",
    "recent development of sensitive instruments , such as bolometer array receivers , makes ( sub-)millimeter continuum observations more effective for carrying out a large - scale survey for massive dense cores .",
    "an unbiased survey of entire gmcs with ( sub-)millimeter continuum has not yet been made , but several surveys in small fields surrounding iras point sources are now in progress for the purpose of detecting massive dense cores located near the iras point sources .",
    "so far , regions of @xmath24 10@xmath32 @xmath12 10@xmath32 around @xmath24 200",
    "iras point sources have been observed at a resolution of 824@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "based on these surveys , a few massive dense cold cores without mid - ir ( msx ) and far - ir ( iras ) counterparts have been found @xcite .",
    "molecular line observations have the invaluable merit of drawing kinematic information within the cores , which is impossible in continuum observations .",
    "the empirical relation between the luminosity of the forming star and the line width of the parent dense core has been found by many authors from observations in nh@xmath34 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in c@xmath3o ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which makes molecular line observations still more important .",
    "we , the nanten group , are now conducting unbiased surveys for dense cores in the c@xmath3o ( @xmath4 = 10 ) line with the nanten 4-meter millimeter telescope .",
    "@xcite compiled a sample of 174 c@xmath3o dense cores in low - mass star - forming regions of taurus @xcite , l1333 @xcite , ophiuchus north @xcite , @xmath35 oph @xcite , chamaeleon @xcite , lupus @xcite , corona australis @xcite , the pipe nebula @xcite , and the southern coalsack @xcite including intermediate - mass cluster - forming regions such as @xmath35 oph , cha i , r cra , and lupus 3 , and found that cores with active star formation tend to have larger column density , number density , and mass , and tend to be gravitationally more bound .",
    "observations toward massive star forming regions are also in progress ; we have detected 112 cores so far in the unbiased surveys for dense cores in gmcs such as orion a , orion b , cepheus ob3 , vela , s35/s37 , and centaurus @xcite .",
    "the beam size of the nanten telescope , 2@xmath367 ( @xmath240.3 pc at the distance of the nearest gmc , orion b , @xmath37 = 400 pc ) , is not necessarily sufficient to resolve massive _ starless _ cores .",
    "however , it is still meaningful to select _ candidates _ for massive _ starless _ cores ( density @xmath38 @xmath17 , size @xmath24 a few pc , mass @xmath30 a few @xmath39 @xmath14 , which are estimated from the physical parameters of massive _ starless _ cores ) , which can be traced by c@xmath3o ( @xmath4 = 10 ) observations with nanten , since only a few massive _ starless _ cores have been identified so far . in this paper , we report the results of an unbiased survey for dense cores in the gmc associated with the @xmath0 carinae nebula ( the @xmath0 car gmc hereafter ) , with the aim of obtaining samples of massive-_starless_-core candidates which are possible sites for future massive star formation .",
    "the @xmath0 car gmc has been one of the most active star - forming regions in the galaxy at least until the formation of the youngest stellar cluster associated with the gmc ( @xmath243 myrs ago , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "eight stellar clusters ( trumpler 14 , 15 , 16 , collinder 228 , bochum 10 , 11 , ngc 3293 , and ngc 3324 ; hereafter we abbreviate trumpler 14 and trumpler 16 as tr 14 and tr 16 , respectively ) are associated with the gmc , which contains more than 64 o - type stars including one of the most massive stars , @xmath0 car @xcite .",
    "when we estimate the star formation activity from the richness of the clusters by counting the number of the most massive stars ( e.g. , stars with the spectral type of o3 ) since the total number of the cluster members can not be counted , the @xmath0 car gmc ( with five o3 stars ) is estimated to be the second most active star - forming region after ngc 3603 with six o3 stars @xcite .",
    "its proximity to the sun ( @xmath37 @xmath24 2.5 kpc for the @xmath0 car gmc compared to 6.9 kpc for ngc 3603 ) makes the @xmath0 car gmc the best site for the detailed study of massive star formation , because much higher spatial resolution can be achieved .",
    "there is a possibility that active star - forming regions , such as w49 , where more than 100 o - type stars have been found in infrared observations @xcite , are hidden in the galactic plane due to heavy foreground extinction .",
    "however , it is natural to think that regions with heavy foreground extinction are located distant from the sun ( 11.4 kpc in the case of w49 ) , and thus the @xmath0 car gmc still remains advantageous .",
    "it is to be noted that the well - studied massive star - forming region , the orion region , is a much smaller system , containing only a single o4 - 6 star @xcite .",
    "several observations have been made so far covering the entire @xmath0 car gmc with moderate spatial resolution .",
    "@xcite observed the whole @xmath0 car gmc ( 3 @xmath12 2 deg@xmath40 ) in the @xmath1co ( @xmath4 = 10 ) line with an 8@xmath368 beam , and revealed the existence of a string of co clouds between @xmath41 = 284@xmath427 and 289@xmath43 with a total mass of 6.7 @xmath12 10@xmath44 @xmath14 . @xcite made sub - millimeter observations in @xmath1co ( @xmath4 = 43 ) and atomic carbon [ ci ] @xmath45@xmath46 with a 3@xmath32 beam , and found that these two emissions and @xmath1co ( @xmath4 = 10 ) are approximately coextensive , and that the excitation temperature is higher ( @xmath24 50 k near @xmath0 car and @xmath24 20 k in clouds farther from @xmath0 car ) than that in dark clouds .",
    "high - resolution observations at a resolution of @xmath242040@xmath33 were made toward some selected clouds near @xmath0 car .",
    "there are two main co emission regions near @xmath0 car ; northern and southern clouds @xcite .",
    "the northern cloud lies surrounding the cluster tr  14 ( @xmath24 7 pc northwest of @xmath0 car ) .",
    "@xcite observed the northern cloud and found that the cloud consists of 4 main co clouds with masses in the range 40500 @xmath14 , two of which are gravitationally bound with density exceeding 10@xmath44 @xmath17 .",
    "they proposed that these clouds are exposed to a radiation field originating mainly from the most massive stars in tr 14 .",
    "the southern cloud is located adjacent to the cluster tr 16 , which includes @xmath0 car .",
    "@xcite found a gravitationally - bound cloud with a mass of 70 @xmath14 , and that a cold iras point source with luminosity @xmath24 10@xmath18 @xmath19 is associated with the cloud .",
    "they concluded that star formation is on - going at the interface between the cloud and the cluster tr 16 , which is triggered by radiation driven shocks . in between the northern and the southern clouds ,",
    "the distribution of the molecular gas is patchy due to dissociation by the strong uv radiation and stellar winds from nearby massive stars in tr 16 @xcite .",
    "they also found that the typical mass of the clouds is @xmath24 10 @xmath14 , and that the clouds are not gravitationally bound .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the region called the giant pillar @xcite , @xmath24 0@xmath425 south of @xmath0 car . since the distance from the clusters is larger than that of the northern and southern clouds , and the giant pillar",
    "is located behind the southren cloud , the influence of the uv radiation and stellar winds from the clusters may be smaller and the photo - dissociation takes longer than the northern and southern clouds . from co @xmath4 = 21 observations toward four mid - ir sources identified by @xcite using mid - infrared data obtained by midcourse space experiment ( msx ) , they found these sources are also influenced by the radiation from clusters tr 14 and tr 16",
    ". the mass of the associated clouds ranges from 1045 @xmath14 and they are probably not gravitationally bound .",
    "they also found 12 candidates for massive young stellar objects and uchiis from the mid - ir data .",
    "these studies revealed that star formation is still on - going in the @xmath0 car gmc under the strong influence of the most massive stars in clusters , in at least 1.5 @xmath12 2 deg@xmath40 regions in the vicinity of @xmath0 car .",
    "here we report the results of an unbiased survey for dense cores in the entire @xmath0 car gmc .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to obtain a sample of massive-_starless_-core candidates which are possible sites for future massive star formation . with moderate spatial resolution , 2@xmath367 , our observation covered the entire @xmath0 car gmc ( 3 @xmath12 2 deg@xmath40 ) including regions farther from @xmath0 car , such as the western part of the @xmath0 car gmc around the h  ii region gum 31 and the southern most part of the @xmath0 car gmc , where no previous observations had been made except coarse large - scale surveys .",

    "out of the 15 c@xmath3o cores detected in this survey , two are on - going massive star forming cores associated with luminous infrared sources and another 4 are possibly less - massive star - forming cores , and thus as many as 913 cores which have not experienced massive star formation , are detected in this survey .",

    "<S> the core with neither iras nor msx point sources shows the presence of a bipolar molecular outflow in @xmath1co ( @xmath4 = 21 ) , which indicates that star formation is also occuring in the core , and the other three of the four h@xmath2co@xmath20 detections show wing - like emission . in total , six c@xmath3o cores out of 15 (= 40@xmath21 ) are experienced star formation , and at least 2 of 15 (= 13 @xmath21 ) are massive - star forming cores in the @xmath0 car gmc . </S>",

    "<S> these properties of the cores may account for the fact that as much as 6087 % of the cores do not show any signs of massive star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the origin of a large amount of turbulence in the @xmath0 car gmc . </S>",
    "<S> we found that turbulence injection from stellar winds , molecular outflows , and supernova remnants which originated from stars formed within the gmc , are not enough to explain the existing turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the possibility that the large turbulence was pre - existing when the gmc was formed , and is now dissipating . </S>",
