    "in 1988 , a. barkai and c.d mcquaid reported a novel observation in population ecology while studying benthic fauna in south african shores @xcite : a predator - prey role reversal between a decapod crustacean and a marine snail .",
    "specifically , in malgas island , the rock lobster _ jasus lalandii _ preys on a type of whelk , _",
    "burnupena papyracea_. as could be easily expected , the population density of whelks soared upon extinction of the lobsters in a nearby island ( marcus island , just four kilometers away from malgas ) .",
    "however , in a series of very interesting controlled ecological experiments , barkai and mcquaid reintroduced a number of _ jasus lalandii _ in marcus island , to investigate whether the equilibrium observed in the neighboring malgas island could be restored .",
    "the results were simply astounding :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` the result was immediate .",
    "the apparently healthy rock lobsters were quickly overwhelmed by large number of whelks .",
    "several hundreds were observed being attacked immediately after release and a week later no live rock lobsters could be found at marcus island . ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    surprisingly , and despite observations such as the report in @xcite , theoretical population biology has largely ignored the possibility of predators and preys switching their roles . of importance , the paper of barkai and mcquaid suggests the existence of a threshold control parameter responsible for switching the dynamics between ( a ) a classical predator - prey system with sustained or decaying oscillations , and ( b ) a predator ( the former prey ) driving its present - day prey to local extinction .",
    "it is worth noting there are some papers in the literature describing ratio - dependent predation ( see , for example @xcite and @xcite ) , but they are not related to the possibility of role - reversals . on the other hand ,",
    "the likelihood of changing ecological roles as a result of density dependence has already been documented for the case of mutualism by breton @xcite and , in 1998 , hernndez made an interesting effort to build a mathematical scheme capable of taking into account the possible switches among different possible ecological interactions @xcite .",
    "so , to the best of our knowledge , there are no theoretical studies supported by field evidence specifically addressing predator - prey role - reversals yet .",
    "predator - prey systems are generally modeled by adopting one of the many variations of the classical lotka - volterra model :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes the intrinsic preys rate of growth , @xmath2 corresponds to the rate of predation upon preys , @xmath3 stands for the predators death rate in absence of preys , and @xmath4 represents the benefit of predators due to the encounters with preys .",
    "our goal is to assess whether modeling the role - reversal behavior observed by barkai & mcquaid @xcite is possible , when adopting appropriate parameters and assumptions .",
    "for instance , if one considers quadratic density dependence in the preys as well as in the predators , non - constant rates of consumption of preys by the predators , and the profiting of predators by the existence of preys , then it is possible to suggest the following system :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 represents the intrinsic growth rate of the prey in the absence of predators , @xmath7 the carrying capacity of the prey s habitat , @xmath8 the rate of preys consumption by the population of predators , @xmath9 the predators decay rate in the absence of preys , @xmath10 the intraspecific rate of competition among predators and , finally , @xmath11 the factor of predator s profiting from preys . the ratio @xmath12 is then the fraction of prey biomass that is actually converted into predator biomass .",
    "the latter should remain constant , since the fraction of preys biomass converted to predators biomass is a physiological parameter , rather than a magnitude depending on demographical variables .",
    "thus , a particular case of system ( [ e1 ] ) in the appropriate rescaled variables is :    @xmath13    where all the parameters are positive and @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , all of the parameters have a relevant ecological interpretation : @xmath15 is the normalized intrinsic growth rate of the species with density @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a measure of the damage intensity of the second species on the first one , @xmath18 is the normalized rate of predators decay and @xmath19 is the benefit ( damage ) the second population gets from the first one .",
    "note the crucial role played by the interaction term @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the first population threshold to switch from being prey to predator .",
    "the horizontal nullcline of the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) , that is @xmath22x=0 $ ] , has two branches : the vertical axis and the nontrivial branch    @xmath23    which is a symmetric hyperbola with asymptotes : @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see figure 1 ) .    [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the dotted line and the vertical axis are the horizontal nullcline .",
    "the continuous downward facing parabola and the horizontal axis are the vertical nullcline .",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the non - trivial equilibria .",
    "the origin of coordinates is a trivial equilibrium.,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=359 ]    the vertical nullcline , @xmath29y=0 $ ] , also has two branches : the horizontal axis and    @xmath30    which is a parabola with @xmath31 , attaining its maximum at @xmath32 , the value of which is    @xmath33    this term is positive if and only if @xmath34 . the zeros , @xmath35 and @xmath36 of equation ( [ e4 ] ) are given by    @xmath37    the latter are real numbers if and only if @xmath38 . the rate of change of @xmath39 is then    @xmath40    to analyze the system while keeping in mind the ecological interpretation of the variables and parameters , we will now consider the left branch of the horizontal nullcline ( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath34 with @xmath14 and the region of the phase plane of the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) defined as    @xmath41    the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) has the equilibria : @xmath42 , @xmath43 plus those states of the system stemming from the intersection of the nullclines @xmath44 and @xmath39 in the region @xmath45 .",
    "such equilibria are defined by the @xmath16 in the interval @xmath46 satisfying the identity    @xmath47    or , equivalently , the @xmath16 that are roots of the third order polynomial    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the calculation of the nontrivial equilibria of ( [ e2 ] ) follows from the determination of the roots of ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "consequently , due to the qualitative behavior of the functions @xmath44 and @xmath39 on @xmath45 , we are faced with the following possibilities :    1 .",
    "the nontrivial branches of the nullclines do not intersect each other in the region of interest .",
    "in such a case , the system ( [ e2 ] ) has just two equilibria : @xmath53 and @xmath26 in @xmath54 .",
    "figure 2a shows the relative position of the nullclines in this case , and figure 3a the phase portrait of the system . + for fixed positive values of @xmath55 and @xmath19 , and @xmath56 such that @xmath57 one can see that both nullclines become closer with increasing values of @xmath21 .",
    "+ , both nullclines touch tangentially .",
    "further changes in the parameter lead to a saddle - node bifurcation , and to the two transversal intersections depicted in figure 1.,title=\"fig:\",width=230 ] [ fig:1a ] + , both nullclines touch tangentially .",
    "further changes in the parameter lead to a saddle - node bifurcation , and to the two transversal intersections depicted in figure 1.,title=\"fig:\",width=230 ] [ fig:1b ] +    +    2 .   the nullclines @xmath44 and @xmath39 touch each other tangentially at the point @xmath58 in the region @xmath54 .",
    "again , figure 2b shows the relative position of the nullclines in this case , and figure 3b the phase portrait of the system .",
    "in such a case @xmath59 , in addition to satisfy ( [ e5 ] ) , must also satisfy the condition @xmath60 _ i.e. _ , + @xmath61 + if one assumes the existence of @xmath59 satisfying ( [ e5 ] ) , the required extra condition ( [ e7 ] ) imposes the restriction @xmath62 on @xmath59 , due to the positiveness of its left hand side .",
    "moreover , from a geometrical interpretation of ( [ e7 ] ) it follows that : * \\(i ) if + @xmath63 there is not any @xmath64 such that @xmath65 . *",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath66 the condition ( [ e7 ] ) is satisfied just at @xmath67 . *",
    "\\(iii ) if @xmath68 there exists exactly one value , @xmath69 , of @xmath70 such that the equality ( [ e7 ] ) holds .",
    "+ in any case , the point @xmath71 is a _ non - hyperbolic _ equilibrium of the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the proof that a tangential contact of the nullclines results in a point where the determinant of the jacobian matrix of the system vanishes follows immediately , implying that at least one of its eigenvalues is zero .",
    "the nullclines intersect each other transversally at two points , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , belonging the region @xmath54 . for reference",
    ", please refer to figure 1 . in this case",
    "the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) has two extra equilibria which arise from the _ bifurcation _ of @xmath71 . + here ,",
    "if in addition to choosing the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 such that @xmath72 , we select the rest of them such that : * \\(i ) @xmath73 , i.e. , + @xmath74>\\frac{b}{c}(2-k),\\ ] ] + guaranteeing the existence of the equilibria @xmath75 and @xmath76 above mentioned .",
    "moreover , the coordinates of these points satisfy @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 with @xmath80 . here",
    "* \\(ii ) @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath74=\\frac{b}{c}(2-k).\\ ] ] + here we have @xmath75 with @xmath77 and @xmath83 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath84 .",
    "part of the local analysis of the system of equations ( [ e2 ] ) is based on the linear approximation around its equilibria .",
    "thus , we calculate the jacobian matrix of the system ( [ e2 ] ) :    @xmath85_{(x , y ) } = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } b(1 - 2x)-cy(k-2x ) & -cx(k - x)\\\\ fy(k-2x ) & -e-2ey+fx(k - x)\\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ]    by a straightforward calculation , we obtain the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix ( [ e9 ] ) at the point @xmath53 .",
    "these are : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "hence , @xmath53 is saddle point of the system ( [ e2 ] ) , for all positive parameter values . by carrying out similar calculations we obtain the corresponding eigenvalues of matrix ( [ e9 ] ) at @xmath26 , which are : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the restriction @xmath14 on @xmath21 implies that @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 is an asymptotically stable node for all the positive parameter values appearing in system ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "now we carry out the local analysis of ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "we notice two cases , depending on the relative position of the nullclines :    * case 1 . * the main branches ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) of the nullclines do not intersect on @xmath54 .    here , any trajectory of system ( [ e2 ] ) starting at the initial condition @xmath91 with positive @xmath92 and @xmath93 tends to the equilibria @xmath53 as time goes to infinity .",
    "thus , the region @xmath94 is the basin of attraction of @xmath26 . invariably , the species with density @xmath95 vanishes , implying non coexistence among the interacting species .",
    "meanwhile , the other species approach the associated carrying capacity .",
    "* the nullclines intersect each other at the points @xmath75 and @xmath96 , where none is tangential . here",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 satisfy @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in a neighborhood of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 satisfy the implicit function theorem .",
    "in particular , each one of the identities @xmath101 and @xmath102 define a function there .",
    "actually , these are @xmath103 and @xmath104 given in ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) , respectively .",
    "their derivative at @xmath105 with @xmath81 is calculated as follows    @xmath106    by using these equalities , we can state the following proposition .    * proposition 1 . * _ the equilibrium @xmath27 is not a saddle point .",
    "meanwhile , the equilibrium @xmath28 is a saddle point for all the parameter values .",
    "_    a proof of this proposition and some remarks can be found in appendix a.      as we have already shown , system ( [ e2 ] ) has four equilibrium points .",
    "these are illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the origin is a saddle point with the horizontal and vertical axis as its unstable and stable manifolds . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , a node and a saddle for parameter values after the bifurcation , and @xmath28 is a stable node .",
    "the stable manifold of the saddle point is a separatrix dividing the phase space in two disjoint regions : the set of initial conditions going to @xmath26 , and the complement with points going to @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , our numerical solution shows the existence of an homoclinic trajectory starting and ending in the saddle point .",
    "thus , we have a bistable system .    ) . from left to right",
    ": @xmath27 is a stable node , @xmath28 is a saddle and @xmath26 is another stable node . the heteroclinic trajectory joining the saddle point to the stable node is easily identified .",
    "the stable manifold is a separatrix between the basin of attraction of @xmath26 and @xmath27.,width=453,height=359 ]    the bistability of system ( [ e2 ] ) has an interesting ecological interpretation :",
    "the coexistence of the interacting species occurs whenever the initial population densities @xmath91 are located in the region above the saddle point unstable manifold . in this case",
    ", both populations evolve towards the attractor @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , if the initial population densities @xmath91 are below the separatrix , the population densities @xmath107 evolve towards the equilibria @xmath26 implying the non - coexistence of the species and , invariably , the species with population density @xmath95 vanishes .",
    "the heteroclinic trajectory of system ( [ e2 ] ) connecting the saddle ( @xmath28 ) with the node ( @xmath27  or focus , depending on the set of parameters ) , in addition to the coexistence of the species , also tells us that this occurs by the transition from one equilibrium to another as time increases .",
    "to describe more accurately our role - reversal system , we extended our model of system ( [ e2 ] ) to incorporate the spatial variation of the population densities . here ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath108 and @xmath109 the population density of the whelks and lobsters at the point @xmath110 at time @xmath111 , the resulting model is :    @xmath112    where the subscript in @xmath113 and @xmath114 denotes the partial derivative with respect the time , and @xmath115 is the laplacian operator . here , @xmath116 , @xmath117 correspond to the diffusivity of the species with density @xmath113 and @xmath114 , i.e. that of whelks and lobsters , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the original variables have been rescaled , but still denote population densities .",
    "we then proceeded to construct numerical solutions of the system ( 10 ) in three different domains : a circle with radius 2.2 length units ( lu ) , an annulus defined by concentric circles of radii 2.2 lu and 1 lu , and a square with side length of 4.6 lu .",
    "all domains were constructed to depict similar distances between malgas island and marcus island ( roughly 4 km ) . in the first one , the annular domain",
    ", we try to mimic the island habitat of whelks and lobsters as a concentric domain .",
    "the other two domains are used to confirm the pattern formation characteristic of excitable media , and to reject any biases from the shape of the boundaries .    to obtain numerical solutions of all spatial cases",
    ", we used the finite element method with adaptive time - stepping , and assumed zero - flux boundary conditions .",
    "accordingly , we discretized all spatial domains by means of delaunay triangulations , until a maximal side length of 0.17 was obtained .",
    "the latter defines the approximation error of the numerical scheme .",
    "we attempted to describe two entirely different situations by using a single set of kinetic parameters : that of malgas island , where both species co - exist , and marcus island , where whelks soar and lobsters become extinct .",
    "the only difference between these two cases was the initial conditions used .",
    "aside , one could intuitively assume whelks motion to be very slow , or even negligible in comparison to that of lobsters .",
    "however , it is worth considering how slow , and whether fluid motion could aftect this speed . while there is no data specific to _ jasus lalandii _ and _ burnupena papyracea _ in islands of the saldanha bay , data of similar species can be found in the literature .",
    "for instance , a related rock - lobster species , _ jasus edwardii _ has been found to move at a rate of 5 - 7 km / day @xcite .",
    "in contrast , whelks within the superfamily _ buccinoidea _ have been found to move towards food at rates between 50 and 220 meters / day ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , predation by whelks remains seemingly unaffected by variations in water flow @xcite .    by putting these findings together ,",
    "we argue a reasonable model need not incorporate influences from shallow water currents , and would assume whelks to move toward ` bait ' at a speed roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that of lobsters .",
    "thus , we opted for a two - dimensional habitat , and one order of magnitude difference between the non - dimensional isotropic diffusion rates ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "aside , our choice of reaction parameters was : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "regarding initial conditions , we adopted the following scenarios , representing the different scenarios of weighted biomass :    1 .",
    "malgas island : the initial density of whelks at each element was drawn from a uniform distribution 0.1 * u(0.25 , 0.05 ) , and that of lobsters from u(0.25 , 0.05 ) .",
    "marcus island : the initial density of whelks at each element was drawn from a uniform distribution u(0.25 , 0.05 ) , and that of lobsters from 0.1 * u(0.25 , 0.05 ) .",
    "results are shown in figure 5 , corresponding to averaged densities of whelks and lobsters in the three different spatial domains , respectively .",
    "simulations in an annular domain can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "interestingly , changes in density are usually accompanied with wave - like spatial transitions in each species density .",
    "examples of this spatial transient patterns can be found in figures 6 and 7 , for annular and rectangular domains in malgas island and marcus island , respectively .",
    "we have modeled a well documented case of role - reversal in a predator - prey interaction . our model pretends to capture the essential ecological factors within the study of barkai and mcquaid @xcite , who did an extraordinary field work and meticulously reported this striking role - reversal phenomenon happening between whelks and lobsters in the saldanha bay .    the analysis of our model and corresponding numerical solutions clearly predict the coexistence of both populations and the switching of roles between the once denoted predators and preys . here , the coexistence scenario corresponds to the case when lobsters predate upon whelks , and role - reversal corresponds to the case when whelks drive the population of lobsters to extinction , as observed by barkai and mcquaid in the field .",
    "moreover , by introducing spatial variables and letting both populations diffuse within a spatial domain , we obtain patterns that are characteristic of excitable media @xcite . of particular interest is the upper row of figure 6 , where self - sustained waves travel in the annular region .",
    "the latter is not entirely surprising , as the ordinary differential equation model in which the spatial case was based shows bistability .",
    "nevertheless , our findings are novel in that , to the best of our knowledge , there are no reports of ecological interactions behaving as excitable media .",

    "first we prove the second part of our proposition .",
    "at @xmath28 we have      @xmath131 implying that @xmath132 and @xmath133 have the same sign at @xmath134 but @xmath135 with @xmath78 and @xmath136 , then @xmath137 and @xmath138 . by using the above calculations we obtain @xmath139 and @xmath140 then , the determinant of the jacobian matrix of the system ( [ e2 ] ) at @xmath28      for the proof of the first part of the proposition we follow a similar sign analysis as we did previously , by considering that @xmath77 , @xmath142 and that at @xmath97 the inequality @xmath143 holds where both derivatives are positive .",
