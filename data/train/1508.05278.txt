    "[ fig : kagome ] ]    we study this model for the special magnetic fields where the number of bands still equals the number of bands without magnetic field .",
    "note that this is an important difference from the investigation of the square lattice by aidelsburger _",
    "_ et al.__where topological effects could only arise once the number of bands was increased by certain values of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the bands and their dispersion are computed as well as the first chern number @xmath2 .",
    "this chern number equals the berry phase @xcite occurring for a bloch state which surrounds the brillouin zone .",
    "the brillouin zone is the relevant two - dimensional manifold , namely , a simple torus @xmath3 .",
    "this chern number is defined by    [ eq : chernzahl ] @xmath4    in eq .",

    "the partial derivatives @xmath9 refer to the derivation with respect to the momenta @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",

    "we compute the above chern number for the three kagome bands , thereby identifying the topologically nontrivial bands .",
    "for simplicity , we study a nearest - neighbor tight - binding model on the kagome lattice . its hamiltonian reads @xmath13 where the indices run over all sites and @xmath14 stands for nearest neighbors .",
    "the creation operator @xmath15 creates a fermion at site @xmath16 and @xmath17 annihilates it . in general",
    ", we consider complex hopping elements @xmath18 with some directed phases @xmath19 resulting from the peierls substitution , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the charge of the hopping particle .",
    "the local potentials are given by @xmath22 .",
    "they depend on the sublattice to which the site @xmath16 belongs .     and @xmath23 as defined in eq .   in the kagome lattice without any magnetic field and local potentials .",
    "the hopping is set to @xmath24 .",
    "note the flat lowest band and the two dirac cones where the two other bands touch with linear dispersion .",
    "[ fig : flux_n0 ] ]    as a reference , we first look at the case without any magnetic fields and without local potentials such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 . it is known that in this case a flat band occurs because the kagome lattice is a line graph , namely , the line graph of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "line graphs are generally known to have flat bands @xcite .",
    "the explicit calculation illustrates the flat band nicely in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n0 ] .",
    "it is based on the @xmath27 matrix in momentum space @xmath28 where we use the wave - vector components    [ eq : some_defs ] @xmath29    with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; i.e. , the lattice constant from one a site to the nearest a site is set to unity .",
    "we stress that the full brillouin zone is given by @xmath32 $ ] because the @xmath33 have only half the length of the primitive vectors .",
    "note that @xmath34 holds according to the above definitions ; only two of the @xmath10 are independent .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the matrix are    @xmath35    these bands are degenerate at @xmath36 where the flat band touches the lower dispersive band and at @xmath37 where the two dispersive bands display dirac cones . due to the degeneracy ,",
    "the chern numbers @xmath2 of the bands are not properly defined .",
    "but even if one breaks the degeneracy , for instance by infinitesimal local potentials , the @xmath2 turn out to be trivial , i.e. , zero , because the model without finite phases is time - reversal invariant which implies @xmath38 .    thus we turn to the model in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the kagome plane .",
    "this induces finite phases according to eq .  .",
    "we do not aim at discussing the complete intricate interplay of discrete lattice symmetry and noncommuting magnetic translations @xcite which give rise to multiple hofstadter bands @xcite .",
    "instead , we aim at the situation where the magnetic translations @xmath39 along the primitive vectors @xmath40 commute .",
    "they obey the relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the magnetic flux through the unit cell measured in units of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order not to increase the number of bands , we avoid decreasing the translational symmetry .",
    "thus we focus on the commuting case @xmath44 implying @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an arbitrary integer . inspecting the unit cell shown by the lightly shaded area in fig .  [ fig : phases ] elementary geometry shows that @xmath47 if @xmath48 is the flux through a triangle .",
    "thus eq . translates to @xmath49 the physics modulo gauge transformations of the phases is only influenced by the fluxes through the loops modulo flux quanta , not by the individual phases .",
    "thus we conclude that the physics , such as chern numbers of the bands , depends on @xmath48 with periodicity of @xmath12 so that we will have to study only the values of @xmath7 modulo 8 .     and",
    "@xmath50 , are introduced which are directed in the sense of the arrows .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ]    we choose a specific gauge where the phases @xmath19 take values as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : phases ] .",
    "the arrows on the bonds stand for the direction of the phases @xmath51 and @xmath50 . in this gauge",
    ", the total phase around the unit cell takes the value zero , which may be a surprise because it seems to reflect zero flux and thus zero magnetic field .",
    "but this is not the case because the sum of all phases along closed loops is meaningful only modulo @xmath12 .",
    "hence zero total phase complies with a finite flux fulfilling eq .  .",
    "to make this point explicit we consider a gauge for arbitrary flux in appendix [ app : arbit ] and show that it can be regauged to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] in appendix [ app : specific ] . in this particular gauge ,",
    "the relation between these phases and the flux @xmath48 is the following    [ eq : micros_relation ] @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 may occur since the fluxes through the loops are only fixed up to multiples of @xmath12 .",
    "the last equation [ eq . ] is the sum of the three equations before with @xmath55 which confirms eq . .",
    "the left - hand side of eq .",
    "stands for the vanishing sum of all phases around a unit cell ; see fig .   [",
    "fig : phases ] .",
    "this does not mean that there is no net uniform magnetic field through the lattice , but it reflects the fact that the magnetic translations commute for the special magnetic fields we are considering because the flux through the unit cell is a multiple of the flux quantum .",
    "thus , there are gauges without net total phase around the unit cells and we are employing such a gauge here for simplicity .",
    "but in the smaller loops , i.e. , the triangles , there is a net flux given by @xmath48 .    for finite phases and local potentials we obtain the following matrix problem : @xmath56 where we use the shorthand @xmath57 for brevity .",
    "we have introduced the average and the difference of the phases @xmath58 and @xmath59 . obviously , the matrix @xmath60 is @xmath12 periodic in @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "interestingly , the band hamiltonian is identical to the ones considered in haldane models before @xcite if @xmath63 and the local potentials are switched off .",
    "but we recall that eq . only holds for uniform magnetic fields which meet the condition .",
    "this observation leads us to the experimentally useful result that certain haldane models can be realized for specific fluxes complying with eq . by uniform magnetic fields .",
    "but the eigenvalues are even periodic in @xmath61 with period @xmath64",
    ". this can be seen by the gauge transformation @xmath65 which transforms the hamiltonian matrix according to @xmath66 the value of @xmath62 remains unchanged . clearly",
    ", the eigenvalues at each momentum do not change under the transformation and hence they are @xmath64-periodic in @xmath61 . since the transformation @xmath67 is independent of momentum it does not change the chern numbers either so that the chern numbers are also @xmath64-periodic . note that a change of @xmath61 by @xmath64 at constant @xmath62 corresponds to the simultaneous change @xmath68 alternatively , the increase of @xmath61 by @xmath64 can be interpreted as an increase of @xmath48 by @xmath12 and the increment @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we see that the physics is indeed @xmath12-periodic in @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , one easily sees that @xmath70 simply leads to a global minus sign in the hamiltonian matrix , thus inverting the sequence of bands and thereby swapping the chern numbers of the first and the third bands .",
    "the change @xmath70 directly corresponds to the change @xmath71 ; see eq .   .",
    "but in view of the @xmath12-periodicity in @xmath48 we find the corresponding bands up to a gauge transformation already for @xmath72 .",
    "for examples , we refer the reader to the sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] below .",
    "moreover , reversing time amounts up to changing the sign of the phases @xmath73 and of the flux @xmath74 ; i.e. , the hamiltonian matrix is complex conjugated .",
    "this transformation of @xmath60 leaves the eigenvalues and , thus the dispersion unchanged because the energy eigenvalues are real numbers .",
    "but it changes the sign of the chern numbers .",
    "combined with the shift of the flux by @xmath75 we obtain the result that the change @xmath76 inverts the energy bands , i.e. , takes the dispersion energy to their negative values , but leaves the chern numbers unchanged .",
    "we will illustrate these properties in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] below .",
    "the chern numbers of the bands are also @xmath64-periodic in @xmath62 because the shift of the momenta    [ eq : shift ] @xmath77    implies @xmath78 , where the last identity holds modulo @xmath12 .",
    "thus , this shift of the momenta corresponds to the change of gauge @xmath79 .",
    "so the eigenvalues at given momenta change , but they are only shifted in reciprocal space . since the chern number is a property of the band in the brillouin zone it does not change under eqs . .",
    "this is obvious if one uses the shifted brillouin zone , shifted by the same amount as in eqs . .",
    "note that a change of @xmath62 by @xmath64 at constant @xmath61 corresponds to the simultaneous change @xmath80    we stress that the combination of the two gauge transformations , eqs . and",
    ", illustrates that the essential physics is determined by @xmath55 while the individual values of the @xmath53 do no matter much .",
    "however , @xmath81 can not be regauged to change by unity only .",
    "in this section , we show explicit results for the dispersion and the chern numbers of the three bands of the kagome lattice in a magnetic field obeying relation .      for vanishing local potential the eigenvalues of the matrix can be determined analytically . solving the characteristic polynomial of order 3",

    "the hopping is set to @xmath24 .",
    "[ fig : flux_n4 ] ]    for simplicity , we choose @xmath86 , thus @xmath63 , and vary @xmath87 to achieve various fluxes @xmath48 . as pointed out above , one only has to consider eight values of @xmath48 because of the @xmath12-periodicity and the quantization condition .",
    "additionally , @xmath88 only inverts the energies and swaps chern numbers so that it is sufficient to consider @xmath89 .",

    "all three bands are separated from one another so that the chern numbers are well defined .",
    "note the gradual evolution upon increasing flux , illustrated nicely from fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n0 ] over the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n123 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n4 ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath76 inverts the signs of the energies is nicely illustrated by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n0 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n4 ] . the same relation is seen between the upper and the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n123 ] .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_n123 ] remains unchanged under inversion of the signs , which implies that the upper and lower bands differ only by their sign and that the middle band is identical to zero .",
    "next , we turn to the chern numbers of the bands",
    ". we did not find a way to evaluate the expressions in eqs . analytically .",
    "moreover , the two - dimensional integrals are difficult to implement numerically to high precision .",
    "but due to the robustness of the discrete chern numbers the computation of accumulated phases on a finite mesh is very accurate , even if the mesh is not particularly dense @xcite .",
    "thus we use this approach to compute the chern numbers shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chern ] .     as defined in eqs . computed for various fluxes @xmath48 for @xmath95 .",
    "the bands are numbered in order of ascending energy .",
    "[ fig : chern ] ]    several interesting observations can be made .",
    "first , the fluxes , which are multiples of @xmath75 , indeed yield trivial bands .",
    "second , incrementing the flux by @xmath75 yields a swap of the chern numbers due to the inverted global sign of the energies .",
    "the change @xmath76 leaves the chern numbers unchanged .",
    "third , swapping the sign of the fluxes swaps also the sign of the chern numbers .",
    "fourth , the gradual evolution of the bands from @xmath96 to @xmath97 with energetically well - separated bands is reflected in constant chern numbers .",
    "further values of @xmath48 do not need to be analyzed because of the @xmath12-periodicity of the chern numbers as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "thus the pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig : chern ] will occur repeatedly .      in order to illustrate that the chern numbers are robust against small changes of the hamiltonian we turn to the case with local potentials .",
    "clearly , equal changes of all potentials @xmath98 , and @xmath99 do not affect the chern number at all because they simply add an identity matrix to @xmath60 which shifts the eigenenergy but has no impact on the eigenvectors and hence no impact on the chern numbers ; see eqs .  .",
    "for illustration , we study two nontrivial patterns of the local potentials , namely @xmath100 and @xmath101 in fig .  [ fig : robust1 ] and @xmath102 and @xmath103 in fig .  [",
    "fig : robust2 ] .",
    "these patterns are applied to the case @xmath104 of which the dispersion without local potentials is shown in the middle panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : flux_n123 ] .",
    "clearly , the nontrivial chern numbers of the lower and upper bands are robust against the local potentials .",
    "it is necessary to apply potentials of the order of @xmath105 to destroy the topological phases because these phases are protected by gaps ; see the middle panel of fig .",

    "even the group velocities differ by about a factor of 2 .",
    "these differences make the assignment of the edge states to the upper and lower edges particularly simple by analyzing mixed boundaries ; see the lower panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : raender ] and [ fig : edge - dispersion ] .",
    "clearly , we partly find the dispersion from the upper panel for the right - moving states and from the lower panel for the left - moving states .",
    "thus the right - moving states live at the lower edge and the left - moving states at the upper edge . of course",
    ", this will be swapped if the sign of the magnetic field is inverted .",
    "we conclude that the shapes of the boundaries open an interesting field for tuning the properties , for instance the transport properties , of topologically nontrivial bands .",
    "we have shown that a crystal lattice with basis equally allows us to induce topologically nontrivial bands upon application of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , the number of bands does not need to be increased from the values at zero magnetic field , which is in contrast to the situation in bravais lattices @xcite .     for a and b sites , respectively .",
    "the experimental realization should be easier in this gauge .",
    "[ fig : gauge_exp ] ]    in particular , we studied nearest - neighbor hopping on the kagome lattice with a three - fold basis .",
    "this lattice is made of triangular loops , i.e. , loops with the smallest number of odd bonds which generically induces frustration effects . without magnetic field",
    "the bands are not separated , but the special magnetic fields which preserve the commutation of the translations induce a proper splitting and nonzero chern numbers for two of the three bands .",
    "interestingly , we found that the kagome lattice in a uniform magnetic field of particular strengths realizes haldane models on this lattice for particular quantized fluxes .",
    "it would be interesting to realize crystal lattices with nontrivial gauges experimentally @xcite . in order not to be forced to induce finite phases @xmath119 for all hopping processes ,",
    "we point out that a simple gauge transformation eliminates all phases on bonds to or from sites of the sublattice c. it consists of the additional factor @xmath120 for a sites and the additional factor @xmath121 for b sites .",
    "of course , the fluxes through the triangles are left unchanged because the phases on bonds between the a and b sites are tripled , @xmath122 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauge_exp ] .    finally , we investigated the edge states for three ways to cut the kagome lattice along the same direction .",
    "again , this possibility is a particular feature for lattices with a basis .",
    "surprisingly , we found a significant qualitative dependence of the dispersion of the edge states on the nature of the boundaries .",
    "the shape and the position of the dispersions differ as well as the group velocities .",
    "still there are left- and right - moving modes which can be clearly assigned to the upper or lower edge .",

    "one may envisage fascinating applications because the transport properties will differ depending on the direction of motion of a fermion from left to right or vice versa .",
    "it is conceivable to build diode like devices if the properties of the edges are tuned to maximize their differing characteristics , for instance the group velocity .    at present ,",
    "the most promising systems for experimental realization are not yet clear @xcite . but recent advances in realizing artificial gauges in systems of optical lattices @xcite make it likely that soon the theoretical results presented here can be put to experimental tests .",
    "the realization of precisely defined edges may pose a problem , but any reproducible difference between two edges of a strip of lattice will make a verification possible .    alternatively , various solid - state systems may constitute alternative routes towards experimental realizations , for instance thin slabs of ferromagnetic chern insulators @xcite , honeycomb lattices built from atoms with higher atomic number @xcite , artificial lattices on surfaces @xcite , or special lattices built from semiconductor nanostructures @xcite . in any case , we conclude that designed crystal lattices constitute a promising field of research .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : arbit ] a general gauge is shown which is a lattice version of the landau gauge .",
    "the phases depend on the @xmath114 coordinate of their bond , i.e. , on the @xmath114 coordinate of the midpoint of their bond .",
    "the dependence is linear , @xmath123 where we imply that the lattice constant is set to unity .    ]",
    "then it is easy to see that indeed the flux through a triangle is given by @xmath124 so that our notation is consistent .",
    "similarly , we find for the flux through the hexagon    @xmath125    as it has to be for a homogeneous magnetic field . in total , the flux through a unit cell is given by @xmath126 .",
    "note that these results do not change if we consider shifted triangles or hexagons in other parts of the lattice .",
    "shifts in the @xmath116 direction do not change the phases at all .",
    "shifts in the @xmath114 direction do not change the fluxes because they depend on phase differences being independent of @xmath114 due to the linearity of eq . .",
    "so the gauge shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arbit ] correctly describes the effect of an arbitrary homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the lattice .",
    "here we show that for @xmath127 the gauge in fig .  [",
    "fig : arbit ] can be regauged to yield the gauge in fig .",

    "the annihilation operators are transformed by the complex conjugate phase factors .",
    "obviously , the phase factors are chosen such that the phases on the bonds @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 match those in fig .",
    "[ fig : specific ] .",
    "we have to check the resulting phase factor on @xmath138 and compute          if we now pass from the sites @xmath132 to @xmath142 to the sites @xmath130 to @xmath131 we can use almost the same transformations because the phases on the bonds are changed by multiples of @xmath75 due to        if @xmath7 is even we may use exactly the same transformations . if @xmath7 is odd we regauge the center site @xmath146 by the factor @xmath147 and we are back to the phases between the sites @xmath132 through @xmath142 and use the regauge transformation . in addition , it is obvious that the phases on the bonds @xmath148 and @xmath149 correspond to the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : specific ] .        because they are not directly deduced from the ones on @xmath132 to @xmath142 .",
    "straightforward calculations verify that these transforms yield the phase pattern shown in fig.[fig : specific ] .",
    "the sites resulting from a shift by one lattice constant to the right are again transformed either exactly the same way as the sites @xmath142 to @xmath129 and @xmath153 if @xmath7 is even . for odd @xmath7 ,",
    "the same transformations are used except for an additional sign change on the shifted center site @xmath154 .    in the next upper row the phase pattern for the row of sites @xmath132 to @xmath142 is repeated . thus one can reuse the transformations except that all the phases must be taken _ relative _ to the phase of the @xmath129 site [ eq . ] ."
