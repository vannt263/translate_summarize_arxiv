    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique based on wavelet analysis approach for calculations related to description of different space - charge effects .",
    "we consider models for space - charge dominated beam transport systems in case when space - charge forces are the same order as external focusing forces and dynamics of the corresponding emittance growth related with oscillations of underlying coherent modes [ 1],[2 ] .",
    "such approach may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related with collective behaviour and corresponding statistical distributions to the problems described by systems of nonlinear ordinary / partial differential equations .",
    "also we consider an approach based on the second moments of the distribution functions for the calculation of evolution of rms envelope of a beam .",
    "the rational type of nonlinearities allows us to use our results from [ 3]-[14 ] , which are based on the application of wavelet analysis technique to variational formulation of initial nonlinear problems .",
    "wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods , which gives us a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and give for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases the maximum sparse forms . in part 2",
    "we describe the approach based on vlasov - type model and corresponding rms equations .",
    "in part 3 we present explicit analytical construction for solutions of vlasov ( besides gaussians ) and rms equations from part 2 , which are based on variational formulation of initial dynamical problems , multiresolution representation and fast wavelet transform technique [ 15 ] .",
    "we give explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the base of high - localized generalized coherent states / wavelets .",
    "our solutions are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlinearity and the others are the linear problems which come from the corresponding wavelet constructions . in part 4",
    "we present results of numerical calculations .",
    "let @xmath0 be the transverse coordinates , then single - particle equation of motion is ( ref.[1 ] for designations ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 describes periodic focusing force and @xmath4 satisfies the poisson equation : @xmath5 with the following density projection : @xmath6 distribution function @xmath7 satisfies vlasov equation @xmath8 using standard procedure , which takes into account that rms emittance is described by the seconds moments only @xmath9 we arrive to the beam envelope equations for @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 but only in case when we can calculate explicitly @xmath13 .",
    "an additional equation describes evolution of @xmath14 : @xmath15 for nonlinear @xmath16 we need higher order moments , which lead to infinite system of equations .",
    "these rms - type envelope equations , from the formal point of view , are not more than nonlinear differential equations with rational nonlinearities and variable coefficients .",
    "one of the key points of wavelet approach demonstrates that for a large class of operators wavelets are good approximation for true eigenvectors and the corresponding matrices are almost diagonal .",
    "fast wavelet transform gives the maximum sparse form of operators under consideration .",
    "it is true also in case of our vlasov - type system of equations ( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "we have both differential and integral operators inside .",
    "so , let us denote our ( integral / differential ) operator from equations ( 1)-(4 ) as @xmath17 and his kernel as @xmath18 .",
    "we have the following representation : @xmath19 in case when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are wavelets @xmath22 ( 7 ) provides the standard representation of operator @xmath17 .",
    "let us consider multiresolution representation @xmath23 the basis in each @xmath24 is @xmath25 , where indices @xmath26 represent translations and scaling respectively or the action of underlying affine group which act as a `` microscope '' and allow us to construct corresponding solution with needed level of resolution .",
    "let @xmath17 act : @xmath27 @xmath28 , with the kernel @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 is projection operators on the subspace @xmath24 corresponding to j level of resolution : @xmath32 let @xmath33 be the projection operator on the subspace @xmath34 then we have the following `` microscopic or telescopic '' representation of operator t which takes into account contributions from each level of resolution from different scales starting with coarsest and ending to finest scales [ 15 ] : @xmath35 we remember that this is a result of presence of affine group inside this construction .",
    "the non - standard form of operator representation [ 15 ] is a representation of operator t as a chain of triples @xmath36 , acting on the subspaces @xmath24 and @xmath34 : @xmath37 where operators @xmath38 are defined as @xmath39 the operator @xmath17 admits a recursive definition via @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 works on @xmath43 . it should be noted that operator @xmath44 describes interaction on the scale @xmath45 independently from other scales",
    ", operators @xmath46 describe interaction between the scale j and all coarser scales , the operator @xmath42 is an `` averaged '' version of @xmath47 .",
    "we may compute such non - standard representations of operator for different operators ( including pseudodifferential ) . as in case of differential operator @xmath48 as in other cases in the wavelet bases we need only to solve the system of linear algebraical equations .",
    "let @xmath49 then , the representation of @xmath50 is completely determined by the coefficients @xmath51 or by representation of @xmath50 only on the subspace @xmath52 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 satisfy the usual system of linear algebraical equations . for the representation of operator @xmath54 or integral operators we have the similar reduced linear system of equations .",
    "then finally we have for action of operator @xmath55 on sufficiently smooth function @xmath20 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is wavelet basis and @xmath58 are wavelet coefficients .",
    "so , we have simple linear parametrization of matrix representation of our operators in wavelet bases and of the action of this operator on arbitrary vector in our functional space",
    ". then we may apply our approach from [ 3]-[14 ] . for constructing the solutions of rms type equations ( 5),(6 ) obtained from vlasov equations",
    "we also use our variational approach , which reduces initial problem to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage .",
    "we have the solution in a compactly supported wavelet basis .",
    "multiresolution representation is the second main part of our construction .",
    "the solution is parameterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems , one is nonlinear and the second are some linear problems , which are obtained from one of the wavelet constructions .",
    "the solution of equations ( 5),(6 ) has the following form @xmath59 which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying scales .",
    "formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into a slow part @xmath60 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary n. so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one to obtain more detailed information about our dynamical process .",
    "the first term in the rhs of representation ( 8) corresponds on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second one to detail space . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time scale .",
    "it should be noted that such representations ( 8) give the best possible localization properties in phase space .",
    "this is especially important because our dynamical variables correspond to distribution functions / moments of ensemble of beam particles .",
    "now we present numerical illustrations of previous analytical approach .",
    "numerical calculations are based on compactly supported wavelets and related wavelet families .",
    "1 demonstrates 6-scale / eigenmodes construction for solution of equations ( 4 ) .",
    "figures  2,3 demonstrate resonances region and corresponding nonlinear coherent eigenmodes decomposition according to equation ( 8) [ 16 ] .",
    "we would like to thank the u.s . civilian research & development foundation ( crdf ) for support ( grants tgp-454 , 455 ) , which gave us the possibility to present our nine papers during pac2001 conference in chicago and ms.camille de walder from crdf for her help and encouragement .",
