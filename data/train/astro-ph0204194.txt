    "the theoretical study of the weak gravitational lensing to probe the statistics of large scale structures in the universe has received much attention ( mellier 1999 , bartelmann & schneider 1999 ) in recent past .",
    "based on the earlier works done by several authors ( gunn ( 1967 ) , blandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , miralda - escude ( 1991 ) and kaiser ( 1992 ) ) , current development has focussed mainly on two different directions .",
    "much progress have been achieved in the field of numerical simulations of the weak lensing , in particular the construction of shear maps which provide invaluable tools in testing the analytical results .",
    "the numerical simulations typically employ n - body simulations , through which ray tracing experiments are conducted ( schneider & weiss 1988 ; jarossznski et al . 1990 ; lee & paczynski 1990 ; jarossznski 1991 ; babul & lee 1991 ; bartelmann & schneider 1991 , blandford et al . 1991 ) .",
    "building on the earlier works of wambsganns et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ) the most detailed numerical study of lensing was done by wambsganns , cen & ostriker ( 1998 ) .",
    "other recent studies using ray tracing experiments have been conducted by premadi , martel & matzner ( 1998 ) , van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier ( 1998 ) , bartelmann et al ( 1998 ) , couchman , barber & thomas ( 1998 ) and jain , seljak & white 2000 .    on the analytical front ,",
    "villumsen ( 1996 ) , stebbins ( 1996 ) , bernardeau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kaiser ( 1992 ) have focussed on the use of perturbative techniques to study weak lensing .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the hierarchical ansatz for the higher order correlation functions can be used to describe the statistical properties of the weak lensing convergence fields for the case of small smoothing angles ( hui 1999 , munshi & coles 1999 , munshi & jain 1999 , valageas 1999a , b , munshi 2000 , munshi & coles 2000a , b ) .    in this paper",
    "we will show that while perturbative calculations have already been used to compute the lower order moments of convergence field , ( see e.g.bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 , van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier 1998 , for detailed review on perturbative calculations in the context of weak lensing surveys see bernardeau 1999 ) ; when coupled with generating function techniques it can also reproduce the complete pdf and bias functions associated with the smoothed projected density field .",
    "we also show that these results can simply be obtained by replacing the generating function of the tree hierarchy in non - linear regime with its quasi - linear counterpart . while the non - linear generating function corresponds to the three dimensional generating function for the matter correlation hierarchy , in the quasi - linear regime it has to be replaced by a generating function which represent the smoothed two - dimensional projected density field .",
    "these generating functions have already been studied in great detail by bernardeau ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) for the case of top - hat smoothing function .",
    "using the recent analytical results from the study of statistics of the convergence field for small smoothing angles , we will introduce a reduced convergence field @xmath0 and study how its statistical properties ( including the lower order moments ) are related with its counterpart used to describe the projected density field .",
    "the weak lensing convergence @xmath1 is simply the projected mass distribution and its statistics carries valuable information about the geometry and dynamics of the background universe as well as the physics of collision - less clustering .",
    "@xmath2    throughout our discussion we will be placing the sources at a fixed red - shift ( an approximation not too difficult to modify for more realistic description ) . the weight function can be expressed as @xmath3 . where @xmath4 is the comoving radial distance to the source placed at a red - shift @xmath5 .",
    "we will be focusing on the quasi - linear regime where it is possible to expand the density contrast using a perturbative series .",
    "@xmath6    it will be useful to work in fourier domain and the fourier decomposition of @xmath7 can be written as :    @xmath8    where we have used @xmath9 and @xmath10 to denote the components of wave vector @xmath11 , parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight direction @xmath12 . in the small angle approximation",
    "however , one assumes that @xmath10 is much larger compared to @xmath9 .",
    "we will denote the angle between the line of sight direction @xmath13 and the wave vector @xmath11 , by @xmath14 .",
    "the smoothing angle will be denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "using the definitions that we have introduced above we can now express the smoothed projected two - point correlation function ( limber 1954 , peebles 1980 , kaiser 1992 , kaiser 1998 ) :    @xmath16    where we have introduced a new notation @xmath17 which denotes the scaled wave vector projected on the surface of the sky .",
    "the average of the two - point correlation function @xmath18 smoothed over an angle @xmath15 with a top - hat smoothing window @xmath19 is useful to quantify the fluctuations in @xmath20 which is often used to reconstruct the matter power spectrum @xmath21 ( jain & selzak 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath22    using the standard perturbative techniques , it is possible to compute the normalized cumulants or @xmath23 parameters , for the convergence field in the large smoothing angle regime .      to construct the probability distribution function ( pdf )",
    "it is necessary to have the @xmath23 parameters for the convergence maps computed to an arbitrary order .",
    "these computations have already been done by bernardeau et al .",

    "these results have already been tested using numerical simulation by munshi et al .",
    "typically for a degree scale smoothing , we will use @xmath32 .",
    "the projection effects are incorporated in the line of sight integration .",
    "such a separation of dynamical part and the geometrical part occurs only when we replace the actual initial power spectra with the local power law spectra ( bernardeau , 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath33    finally we can write down the normalized cumulants for the convergence field as :      the generating function approach developed by balian & schaeffer ( 1989 ) and later extended by bernardeau & schaeffer ( 1992 ) was used to compute the whole hierarchy of @xmath23 parameters for the three dimensional matter distribution and the projected matter distribution ( bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "the generating function is related to the vertices which appear in the tree representation of the correlation hierarchy which appear in the quasi - linear evolution of gravitational clustering .",
    "@xmath35    such a hierarchy also appears in the highly non - linear regime but with different tree amplitudes .",
    "the generating function for the @xmath23 parameters can similarly be represented as ( balian & schaeffer 1989 ) :    @xmath36    the function @xmath37 satisfies the constraint @xmath38 necessary for the normalization of the pdf .",
    "these two generating function are known to be related to each other by the following set of equations ( balian & schaeffer 1989 , bernardeau & schaeffer 1992 ) :    @xmath39    hence once we know the generating function @xmath40 it is possible to compute the whole hierarchy of the projected @xmath23 parameters .",
    "it was shown that the generating function takes a particularly simple form ( bernardeau 1995 ) :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 for 2d perturbative dynamics of gravitational clustering in a 3d universe .",
    "this particular result hold for unsmoothed density field but it is possible to incorporate the effect of smoothing into account if we assume that the smoothing window is a top - hat function ( bernardeau 1994 , bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath43^{1/2}\\right)\\over \\sigma(r_0)}\\right].\\ ] ]    for the variance @xmath44 at length scale @xmath45 will use the local power spectral index @xmath31 so that @xmath46 .",
    "the vpf and the pdf can be related to each other by the following equation ( balian & schaeffer 1989 ) : @xmath47 \\label{pdf}.\\ ] ]    the above expressions are clearly suitable for the density field and similar calculations can be done for convergence maps and the generating functions for the cumulants of the convergence maps can then directly be related to its counterpart for the density field .",
    "the details of such calculations can be found in munshi & jain ( 1999 ) and valageas(1999b ) .",
    "our notations follow that of munshi & jain ( 1999 ) more closely .",
    "these studies clarified that it is useful to define a reduced convergence map @xmath0 smoothed with an angle @xmath15 ;    @xmath48    where the minimum value of the convergence along any line of sight direction can be defined by the following equation : @xmath49    under certain approximation @xmath0 will have the exactly same one - point statistics as the density field @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51    = 3.5truein    notice that the quantity @xmath52 does not depend on the smoothing angle @xmath15 and hence will only depend on the source red - shift @xmath5 and the definition of reduced convergence remains same both in the quasi - linear and the highly non - linear regime and is not connected with the convergence or divergence of the perturbative series .    in general the expression connecting the cumulant generator for @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath53 can be related to @xmath54 by the following approximation .",
    "@xmath55 } \\int_0^{\\chi_s } d \\chi   \\big [ { r^2(\\chi ) \\over \\kmin } { \\av \\over \\ex } \\big ] \\phi^{\\rm pt } \\big [ \\omega(\\chi ) \\kmin { \\ex \\over r^2(\\chi ) \\av }    \\big ] \\ ] ]    clearly this expression does not depend on whether we are in the quasi - linear regime or in the highly non - linear regime . only changes which are to be made is that of @xmath54 . in quasi - linear regime",
    "the quasi - linear phi can be computed from quasi - linear generating function for tree vertices defined earlier and in highly non - linear regime it needs to replaced with its non - linear counterpart .",
    "the simplification mentioned above can be achieved by replacing the red - shift dependence of different integrands with their values at a median red - shift .",
    "numerical computations seems to suggest that such an approximation works remarkably well ( valageas 1999b , munshi & jain 1999a ) .",
    "it is possible to have different approximate asymptotic expressions for different limiting values of @xmath0 .",
    "however here we have performed a direct numerical integration and results for different cosmologies and various smoothing angles are presented in the figure-1 and figure-2 .",
    "the different curves represent various versions of ( standard , lambda , omega and @xmath56 ) cold dark matter models .",
    "the details of various parameters charecterising these dark matter models can be found in munshi & jain ( 1999a ) .    as in the case of quasi - linear regime",
    "we now get :    @xmath57    although these expressions are very similar to their small angle counterparts ( munshi & jain 1999a , valageas 1999 ) , however it is not very difficult to notice that there is a sharp difference between the two . for larger smoothing angle",
    "the statistics of reduced convergence map follows that of projected density field which in turn is related to the results associated with the two dimensional perturbations in a three dimensional universe . however in case of very small smoothing angles when we are probing the non - linear regime , the statistics of the convergence maps is that of full three dimensional density field .",
    "the intermediate regime is more difficult to model and it interpolates these two regimes in a smooth manner .",
    "numerical investigations of @xmath58 was done by gaztanaga & bernardeau ( 1998 ) for scdm model for various smoothing angle . we find a good agreement between our results and their numerical measurements for angular scales as small as @xmath59 . which means that our analytical results for pdf and bias ( based on tree - level calculations ) , may even be valid for much smaller angular scales .",
    "a detailed comparison however will require a large simulation patch and is not available at present .",
    "= 3.5truein      while it is clear that one - point studies of convergence field is interesting it was shown by munshi ( 2001 ) that such results can also be obtained for the case of two - point quantities such as bias associated with the convergence map @xmath60 and its moment , the cumulant correlators @xmath61 ( see munshi , melott & coles 1999 for detailed descriptions of generalized cumulant correlators based on various hierarchical models ) .    @xmath62    we have used shorthand notations @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 to simplify the above expression . a similar expression can be obtained for the reduced convergence map @xmath0 .",
    "our studies in the highly non - linear regime have shown that the hierarchical ansatz can be used to understand how the ` hot - spots ' in convergence maps are correlated and how such correlations can be used to study the similar correlation for the underlying matter distribution and hence the bias associated with the collapsed objects .",
    "we will show that a similar study is also possible in the quasi - linear regime with appropriate change in the generating function as was the case for non - linear regime .",
    "the normalized cumulant correlators or @xmath66 parameters have been calculated for dark matter density perturbations using direct perturbative calculations for low orders and for arbitrary orders using the generating function techniques .",
    "we can define these parameters by the following relation    @xmath67    these parameters were computed by bernardeau(1996 ) for the density field and were found to obey a generic factorization rule @xmath68 for the case of 3d perturbations .",
    "similar computations were later generalized for the case of 2d perturbations .",
    "@xmath69    for projected fields we will get a prefactor resulting from the line of sight integration as was the case for the one - point cumulants .    @xmath70=c^{\\rm pt}_{p1}c^{\\rm pt}_{q1 } { \\cal c}_{p+q}[i^{(p+q-2)}_{\\kappa_{\\theta_0 } } i_{\\kappa_{\\theta_{12 } } } ] % = c_{pq}^{\\kappa } \\langle % \\kappa_s^2 \\rangle_c^{(p+q-2 ) } \\langle \\kappa_s({\\bi \\gamma_1 } ) \\kappa_s({\\bi \\gamma_2 } ) % \\rangle_c\\ ] ]    where we have introduced a new quantity @xmath71 which incorporates the line of sight integration effects for the two - point quantities , such as the cumulant correlators and bias which we are considering here .    @xmath72    \\equiv    \\int_0^{\\chi_s } { \\omega^{t } ( \\chi ) \\over % r^{2(t-1)}(\\chi ) } f(\\chi ) d \\chi.\\ ] ]    .",
    "it can be shown that the role of the generating function for the normalized cumulant correlators for the ( unsmoothed ) density field @xmath73 @xmath74 is played by the quantity @xmath56 itself .",
    "@xmath75    in a very similar way we can define the generating function @xmath61 for the convergence map @xmath1 by the following relation :    @xmath76    however such a factorization is not possible for the projected density fields , without some simplifying assumptions and in general we have to use the generating function for @xmath77 which we denote as @xmath78 . using relations",
    "we have already presented above we can finally write :    @xmath79 \\big ] \\big [ \\int   { d^2 { \\bf l } \\over ( 2 \\pi)^2 ) }   p ( { \\bf l \\over r(\\chi ) } )   w^2(l\\theta_0 ) \\big ] ^{p+q-2 } y_1^p y_2^q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as was the case with one point cumulants we can use the reduced convergence @xmath80 to simplify the analysis because as pointed out earlier the statistics of reduced convergence map is very similar to that of the underlying projected density field .",
    "@xmath81 ^ 2 } \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\times ~~\\beta^{\\rm pt } \\big ( { y_1 \\over \\one } { \\omega(\\chi ) \\over r^2 ( \\chi ) } \\var \\kmin   \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times ~~ \\beta^{\\rm pt } \\big ( { y_2 \\over \\one } { \\omega(\\chi ) \\over r^2 ( \\chi ) } \\var   \\kmin \\big ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we use the same techniques which we have used to simplify the integrals associated with one the point cumulants ( see munshi & jain 1999a , and munshi 2000 ) where we replaced the red - shift dependence in integrands with their values at a median red - shift we can write :    @xmath82    this is exactly the same result which we have obtained for small smoothing angle , however results we have derived here are valid for large smoothing angles and hence the generating function @xmath83 corresponds to the case of perturbative regime .",
    "if we neglect the effect of smoothing the generating function @xmath83 is simply the function @xmath84 ( bernardeau 1996 ) however for smoothed convergence maps we can write ( bernardeau 1996 ) :    @xmath85^{1/2}\\right)}.\\ ] ]    finally the bias @xmath86 can be expressed as :    @xmath87 /   \\int_{-i\\infty}^{i\\infty } { dy \\over 2 \\pi i } ~ \\exp \\big [ { \\eta y - \\phi^{\\rm pt}(y )   \\over \\bar \\xi_2 } \\big ]   \\label{bias}.\\ ] ]    the generating function for @xmath0 and projected density field are same under certain simplifying approximation , it shows that the bias associated with the reduced convergence is very similar to the statistics of the projected density field .",
    "this is in direct contrast with what was obtained using the nonlinear theory for small smoothing angle where the statistics of hot - spots in projected map are more closely related to the underlying three dimensional density field and not to the projected density field .",
    "finally the bias associated with the convergence @xmath1 can be expressed by the following equation .",
    "@xmath88    = 3.5truein    clearly it is possible to integrate the exact equation which represents joint moments exactly and hence compute the exact bias function for large smoothing angle from @xmath89 , but it was found by munshi(2000 ) that simplification of replacing all the integrals by their approximate values , works remarkably well , when tested against numerical simulations .",
    "we will adopt the same technique for this study .",
    "result of such numerical integration for different cosmologies are presented in figure-3 and figure-4 .",
    "instead of plotting the differential bias function we have plotted its integral part which simply represent the bias associated with spots which cross certain threshold in reduced convergence .",
    "such a bias is easier to measure from numerical maps .",
    "we find that the bias predictions based on log - normal models also match perturbative calculations reasonably well .    while in the non - linear regime it is possible to extend such studies to even higher order where one gets the complete picture for the many - point statistics of over - dense cells , similar analysis is not possible in quasi - linear regime as the tree - vertices @xmath90 defined above are dependent on shape factors .",
    "different sources of noise affect the measurement of one - point quantities such as pdf and two - point quantities such as bias from observational data or numerical simulations . while for small angular scales the major concern is always the noise due to intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies at larger smoothing angle it is finite volume corrections which starts playing the major role .",
    "it manifests itself mainly on large @xmath1 tail of the pdf and bias and depends on the presence or absence of a rare cluster in the catalog .",
    "the large @xmath1 tail generally shows large fluctuations before showing an abrupt cutoff for a certain threshold beyond which there are no more over - dense cells in the catalog .",
    "similar effects are observed in the determination of bias too .",
    "perturbative calculations have already been used to compute the lower order hierarchy of @xmath23 parameters associated with the convergence maps in quasi - linear regime . on the other hand hierarchical ansatz",
    "was shown to be useful in highly non - linear regime . in this particular paper",
    "we have shown how the recent development in highly non - linear regime can also be used to study the quasi - linear regime by introducing a reduced convergence field to construct the full pdf and bias associated with convergence maps in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "we have shown that a reduced convergence field in fact is related directly with the two - dimensional projected density field .",
    "it is known from earlier studies that the generating function corresponding to the two - dimensional density field is connected with the two dimensional spherical collapse . which indicates that such a generating function now can be used to predict the pdf and bias of smooth convergence maps in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "a quick comparison with corresponding results in highly non - linear regime shows that while statistics of projected density for small smoothing is intimately related with the full three dimensional density field at larger smoothing angle it is related to the projected two dimensional density field .    from observational point of view our results will have direct significance .",
    "while most recent observational studies cover rather small patches of the sky necessary for quasi - linear approximations to be valid , it is hoped that larger and larger patches of the sky will be covered in future , where one can apply perturbative techniques . at smaller angular scales",
    "it is well known that noise due to intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies will play a major role in determination of the cosmological parameters , however such noise will be less significant for studies at larger angular scales where our results will have direct relevance .",
    "although signal variance will start declining with larger and larger smoothing angle and direct determination of weak lensing signal at degree scale might seem difficult at present , in the intermediate length scale @xmath91 where the hierarchical ansatz starts to break down our analysis using perturbative techniques will provide much needed theoretical insight .",
    "most of the presently available numerical maps for cosmic shear are generated from high resolution numerical simulation and are generally correspond to few degree patches in the sky which are suitable for testing analytical predictions for smaller smoothing angles , and recent comparison of various statistics were found to be very accurately reproduced by non - linear theory .",
    "such studies for larger smoothing angles will have to wait till much larger numerical maps are available .",
    "there have been some attempts in this direction using higher order lagrangian theories which replaces the exact gravitational dynamics .",
    "such models although less accurate can reproduce the basic features of convergence maps in larger smoothing angles and are definitely very cost effective . for reproducing the statistics of convergence maps made using higher order lagrangian perturbation theory we just need to change the exact generating function which we have used in this study by corresponding smoothed generating function for perturbative lagrangian dynamics for the case of projected perturbations and it can then be used to compare with numerical studies .",
    "it can be shown that the frozen flow approximation as proposed by matarrese et al(1992 ) . will produce a log - normal pdf in the quasi - linear regime ( munshi , sahni & starobinsky 1994 ) , hence such an approximation",
    "can also be used to generate convergence maps .",
    "results presented here can be generalized very easily for the case of projected galaxy survey .",
    "a detailed study will be presented elsewhere .",

    "although inherently local in nature we found that it can also be used as a good fitting function for both one - point probability distribution function ( see bernardeau & kofman 1995 for similar comparison in 3d for density pdf ) and the bias function associated with the convergence maps .",
    "for the projected density contrast @xmath7 ( which is related to the reduced cnvergence field @xmath94 ) we can write the pdf as :              @xmath98 and @xmath99 denotes the non - linear and linear correlation functions and can be computed using suitable modelling of non - linear evolution e.g. peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) . to compute the one - point and two - point pdf s for @xmath1 from above expressions we have to apply the transformation @xmath100 ( which involve computation of @xmath101 ) discussed before .",
