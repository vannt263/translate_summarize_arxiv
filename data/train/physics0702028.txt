    "after a meal or a drink , fidgety people sometimes play with the available props , such as empty glasses , bottles , and soda cans .",
    "these containers are all nearly axi - symmetric objects with round bottoms .",
    "a natural form of play is to roll these containers on their circular bottoms . when a slightly tipped container ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ovaltinetippedphoto ] ) is let go , sometimes one sees it fall upright , make a slight banging sound , and then tip up again at another angle , then fall back upright again , and so on for a few rocking oscillations . because these oscillations usually damp quickly its easy to miss the details of the motions . to aid the eye , instead of just letting go of the slightly tilted container , you can flick its top forward with the fingers .",
    "this provides an initial righting angular velocity along the axis about which the container was initially tipped ( too large an angular velocity will cause the container to lift off the table as it pivots over ) .",
    "the tipping container , as before , falls to a vertical configuration , at which time its bottom circular face bangs on the table .",
    "after this bang , the container tips up onto the other side and maybe falls over . when this experiment is performed with a container that is not too tall and too thin",
    ", you can see that the container does not fall exactly onto the diametrically opposite side of the bottom rim .",
    "that is , point a on the bottom of the container that initially contacted the table and the new contact point b , that the container rocks up onto , are not exactly 180 degrees apart .",

    "note the apparent symmetry breaking with @xmath1 .",
    "is this deviation from symmetric rocking due to imperfect hand release ?",
    "here we show that the breaking of apparent symmetry is consistent with the simplest deterministic theories , namely smooth rigid body dynamics .",
    "we derive formulas for the `` angle of turn '' , for both the perfect - rolling and for the frictionless - sliding cases given infinitesimal symmetry breaking in the initial conditions .",
    "the results here generalize some of the nearly - falling - flat results of cushman and duistermaat @xcite ; they considered the special case of the pure - rolling of flat disks .    .",

    "if the table was perfectly planar and horizontal , the container s bottom was perfectly circular , and the container was perfectly axisymmetric , then an initial condition with a purely righting angular velocity would result in a collision in which , just as the container becomes vertical , all points on the container s bottom slap the table - top simultaneously .",
    "the consequence of such a rigid - container collision is not computable since algebraic rigid - body collision laws are not well - defined for simultaneous multi - point collisions ; for example , the order of the impulse locations is then ill - defined @xcite . basing the rocking outcome on such a perfect flat collision",
    "would be basing the outcome on details of the deformation , that is , leaving the world of rigid - object mechanics .",
    "geometric perturbations to the circular rim can similarly lead to two - point collisions , where both points of contact are now on the rim .",
    "the second point of contact could be diametrically opposite to the first point , or anywhere else on the rim .",
    "we could then compute the consequences of , say , a plastic collision at the new point of contact .",
    "however , the consequences of the collision would depend on the location of the geometric imperfection . for a given collision point ,",
    "such a theory could predict the energy dissipation at the collision .",
    "but such a theory can not be useful in predicting a systematic breaking of symmetry as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterplotovaltine ] . for",
    "any given imperfection , the motion is deterministic and depends on the location of the impection , and there is no reason to expect that the location of the imperfection would have a distribution similar to that in fig .  [",

    "predicts @xmath4 degrees for frictionless sliding and @xmath5 degrees for rolling with no slip . ]",
    "assuming a perfectly flat rigid bottom , the circle - slapping - ground simultaneous collision is essentially impossible . after all , the container is being launched by imperfect human hands that can not provide any exact initial conditions",
    ". accounting for various symmetries in the problem , the set of all motions of a container rolling without slip is three dimensional ; the space of solutions could be parameterized by , say , the minimum tip angle @xmath6 , the yaw rate @xmath7 at that position , and the rolling rate @xmath8 at that position .",
    "the set of solutions that leads to a face - down collision can be characterized with only two parameters , a set with co - dimension one @xcite .",
    "so , small generic perturbations of a `` collisional '' initial condition result , with probability 1 , in a non - collisional motion described by the smooth dynamics of the container rolling or sliding on its circular bottom rim .",
    "the rest of this paper is about the near - collisional motions .",
    "we will see that these near - collisional motions involve rapid rolling or sliding of the container on its bottom rim , so that the contact point appears to have switched by a finite angle that is greater than 180 degrees . for this analysis",

    "without loss of generality the center - of - mass can be taken as on a fixed vertical line .",
    "our initial discovery of the phenomenon described here was found in numerical simulations of the equations above .",

    "first , we integrate the equations with initial conditions that lead exactly to a face - down collision @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and say , @xmath41 . as would be expected , the container lands in a manner that all of its bottom face simultaneously reaches the horizontal table - top .",
    "up to this time the motion of the container is identical to that of an inverted pendulum hinged at the contact point a. the integration becomes physically meaningless at that collision point .    in the vicinity of these collisional motions , the solutions of the equations of motion here",

    "[ fig : purerollnumresults ] .",
    "the plot of @xmath46 suggests a motion in which the container s bottom face periodically comes close to touching the table ( @xmath47 ) , but then gets `` repelled '' by the floor as if by an elastic collision , so that the container rocks down and up periodically , ad infinitum , without losing any energy , as expected from this dissipation - free system .",
    "we notice that when @xmath48 , @xmath49 changes almost discontinuously . also , when @xmath31 is close to zero , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 blow up to very large values , resulting in almost discontinuous changes in the corresponding angles @xmath22 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that we are simply simulating the apparently smooth differential equations , and not applying an algebraic transition rule for a collision .",
    "as @xmath45 goes to zero , the angle rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 grow without bound , but the magnitude of the angular velocity vector is always bounded , as it must be since energy remains a constant throughout the motion . in particular , while the angle rates @xmath8 and @xmath7 are large , they are very close to being equal and opposite ( @xmath50 , fig .  [",

    "the position of the contact point p@xmath51 on the ground relative to the center of mass @xmath18 is given by the following equations : @xmath52 when @xmath48 and @xmath22 is not particularly close to any multiple of @xmath53 , the contact point position is given by @xmath54    given that @xmath55 do not change much during the brief near - collisional phase ( because center of mass velocity is finite ) , we can see from eq .",
    "[ eq : contactptcircle ] that a rapid continuous change in @xmath22 corresponds to a rapid continuous change in the contact point in a circle with the center @xmath56 .",

    "we consider the near - collisional motions of the no - slip container that can be characterized as being the pasting - together of two qualitatively distinct motions of vastly different time - scales :    1 .",

    "rapid rolling of the container which accomplishes in infinitesimal time , a finite change in the contact point , and a sign - change in the tilt rate @xmath49 .",
    "note that the near - collisional motion for a container rolling without slip requires very high friction forces ( for non - zero @xmath11 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : purerollnumresults]g ) .",
    "however , plotting the ratio of the required friction forces with the normal reaction , we find that only a finite coefficient of friction is required for preventing slip even in the collisional limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : purerollnumresults]h ) .    the other extreme of exactly zero friction is similar . here",
    ", the horizontal component of the center of mass velocity may be taken to be zero .",
    "the near collisional motions for a container sliding without friction are again characterized as consisting of two qualitatively different phases :    1 .   a tipping phase when @xmath31 is not too small , involving the container moving nearly in a vertical plane , the center of mass moving only vertically , and the contact point slipping without friction .",
    "a rapid sliding phase in which the sign of @xmath49 is reversed almost discontinuously , and the contact point moves by a finite angle in infinitesimal time .",
    "the angle of turn for the frictionless case and the no - slip case are different in general ( when @xmath58 ) . in the next two sections , we derive the formulas for the angle of turn by taking into account the two - phase structure of the near - collisional motion .",

    "reasonable reviews of such literature can be found , for instance , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will not use these somewhat cumbersome general solutions but will analyze only the special near - collisional motion of interest to us .",
    "the calculation below may be called , variously , a boundary layer calculation , a matched asymptotics calculation ( but we are not interested in an explicit matching ) or a singular perturbation calculation . essentially , we take advantage of the presence of two dynamical regimes with vastly different time - scales , each regime simple to analyze by itself . the overall motion can be obtained approximately by suitably pasting together the small-@xmath31 and the large-@xmath31 solutions .",
