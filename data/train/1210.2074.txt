    "the recent beam energy scan ( bes ) program @xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) pursues one of the major goals of heavy - ion collision experiments : to explore the qcd phase diagram and search for the phase boundary between the normal nuclear matter and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . the bes program at rhic together with pb+pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "provide us with a unique opportunity to study systematically the collision energy dependence of a large number of relativistic heavy - ion collision observables .    here",
    "we study the collision energy dependence of charged hadron transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients @xcite , using ( 2 + 1)-d viscous hydrodynamics coupled with a modern lattice qcd based equation of state @xcite .",
    "our work focuses on qualitative tendencies rather than quantitative comparison with experimental data .",
    "it makes simplifying assumptions that are justified at high energies but gradually break down at lower @xmath7 : longitudinal boost invariance , an equation of state for matter with zero net baryon density , and a purely hydrodynamic approach with constant specific shear viscosity , including for the dilute hadronic rescattering stage which at lower energies occupies an increasing fraction of the fireball s dynamical history and should be described microscopically @xcite .",
    "these limitations can be cured in future work ; they are expected to modify our conclusions quantitatively but not qualitatively .",
    "* evolution of charged hadron multiplicity and total elliptic flow : *       in figs.[fig3]a , b , we show the differential charged hadron elliptic flow for au - au or pb - pb collisions at 20 - 30% centrality .",
    "the differential elliptic flow is affected by both total elliptic and radial flow . with mc - glauber initial conditions",
    "the differential elliptic flow for @xmath9gev/@xmath10 remains almost unchanged for @xmath11@xmath1gev . as the collision energy increases , both radial and elliptic flow increase , due to",
    "the longer fireball lifetime .",
    "naively the increasing total elliptic flow should also lead to a larger differential @xmath12 , but this tendency is counteracted by the growing radial flow which blueshifts the momentum anisotropy to larger @xmath13 . for the runs with mc - kln initial conditions we use a larger @xmath14 value .",
    "the resulting larger viscous effects suppress the total elliptic flow at lower collision energies more strongly than for the mc - glauber runs , leading to a monotonous decrease of the slope of the differential @xmath15 with decreasing collision energy .",
    "to further illustrate this point we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , d the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath16 at 5 fixed @xmath13 points . in this representation",
    "one sees that for the mc - glauber model with @xmath17 , @xmath18 at any fixed @xmath19gev/@xmath10 features , as a function of @xmath7 , a very broad maximum around top rhic energy ( 200@xmath1gev ) . for lower @xmath20gev/@xmath10 , heavier particles , or smaller @xmath14 this maximum moves towards lower @xmath7 . with the larger @xmath21 used in the mc - kln model ,",
    "the strong reduction of @xmath18 at low collision energies shifts the maximum of @xmath18 at any fixed @xmath13 towards higher @xmath7 ; fig .",
    "[ fig3]d shows that for @xmath21 this observable does not peak below the top lhc energy , except for very small @xmath22mev/@xmath10 .",
    "-dependence of the final spatial eccentricity @xmath23 of the isothermal kinetic freeze - out surface at @xmath24mev , for 10 - 30% centrality .",
    "the initial eccentricity is 0.26 for the mc - glauber model and 0.32 for the mc - kln model .",
    "the experimental points indicate preliminary data @xcite from an azimuthal hbt analysis by the star collaboration . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the final fireball eccentricity calculated along the kinetic freeze - out surface , @xmath25mev , as a function of collision energy . as the collision energy increases , the final spatial eccentricity @xmath23 decreases monotonically for both mc - glauber and mc - kln models .",
    "this is because at higher collision energy the fireball has longer lifetime to decompress its original deformation and become more isotropic . in fig.[fig4 ] , we compare our results with recent star data from an azimuthal hbt analysis @xcite .",
    "our calculations qualitatively agree with the experimental data and reproduce the trend of the collision energy dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "mc - glauber runs with @xmath17 quantitatively reproduce the data at @xmath26gev while underpredicting the final eccentricity by @xmath2710% at lower energies .",
    "mc - kln initial conditions with @xmath21 result in 15 - 20% larger final eccentricities , due to the @xmath2720% larger initial eccentricities of the mc - kln profiles . within the explored range , we found weak sensitivity of these curves to @xmath14 . extending our calculations to lhc energy",
    "we predict that @xmath23 will approach zero around @xmath28 - 5.5@xmath1tev .    *",
