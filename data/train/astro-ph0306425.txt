    "there has been a recent upsurge in interest in interstellar dust emission , both in our own galaxy and in extragalactic environments .",
    "galactic dust emission in the far - infrared ( fir ) and microwave is a primary source of contamination to measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "association of the observed cosmic infrared background ( cib ) with dust emission from high - redshift galaxies @xcite and the recognition of the potential use of this source as a probe of structure formation @xcite has placed a high priority on understanding extragalactic dust properties .",
    "most of what we know about interstellar dust from our own and other galaxies comes from measurements of extinction ( absorption plus scattering ) in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and near- to mid - infrared ( nir , mir ) @xcite .",
    "extinction measurements can be compared to dust models @xcite to constrain the size , composition , and density of dust grains .",
    "low - frequency ( @xmath1 thz ) dust emission is thought to be dominated by thermal greybody emission from dust grains heated by the interstellar radiation field ( irf ) , so to turn the knowledge of the dust from extinction into a prediction for low - frequency dust emission , one needs two further pieces of information : the spectrum of the irf and the greybody emissivity of the different grain populations  in general a function of frequency , grain size , and grain composition .",
    "conversely , one can use measurements of low - frequency dust emission combined with models of the dust density and optical properties to constrain models of the irf .    in the simplest models of optical properties of dust at low frequencies ,",
    "the dust emissivity is independent of grain size and composition . @xcite and",
    "@xcite ( hereafter dl84 ) argue that for dust grains much smaller than a wavelength ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the grain radius ) , the emission cross - section will be proportional to the volume of the grain .",
    "the emissivity per unit dust mass for a given dust density is then independent of the nature of the grain size distribution as long as all grains are small compared to the wavelengths of interest . dl84",
    "argue further that electric dipole radiation will dominate in this limit , and the dust emissivity will be proportional to the square of the frequency , regardless of dust composition .",
    "later theoretical work @xcite and laboratory measurements @xcite have suggested different power - law indices for ir dust emissivity , depending on composition , and ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , even in the regime @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite have also found evidence for temperature - dependent behavior of the power - law index for certain types of amorphous silicate grains .",
    "further complicating matters is the possibility that different dust populations along a single line of sight can have different emission temperatures , even if the radiation field does not change along the line of sight .",
    "grains in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) are predicted to have temperatures of @xmath6 ( dl84 ) , but very small grains can be transiently heated to temperatures of hundreds of kelvin by a single uv photon and will cool to ambient temperature by re - emitting in the nir / mir @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the maximum grain radius @xmath3 at which this effect is noticeable to be @xmath7 .",
    "they divide silicate and carbonaceous ( graphite ) dust into `` big '' and `` small '' populations based on this criterion and estimate emission from small grains to be an important contributor at @xmath8 ghz but small compared to large - grain emission at @xmath9 ghz and lower frequencies .",
    "@xcite have combined data from the infrared astronomy satellite ( _ iras _ ) at @xmath8 ghz ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath9 ghz ( @xmath11 ) with @xmath12 ghz ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ghz ( @xmath15 ) data from the sub - millimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera and other sub - mm measurements in the literature to characterize the dust emission from 32 nearby galaxies . in an earlier study , @xcite found that fitting just the two _ iras _ points and the scuba @xmath14 ghz point resulted in derived temperatures of @xmath16 and emissivity indices of @xmath17 for a larger sample of 104 nearby objects .",
    "the new study finds that for the sources for which they were able to add more sub - mm points , the spectra were better fit by a model with two components at different temperatures , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the authors note that these conclusions are not definitive , due both to a paucity of measurements for most of their sources ( only 10 of their sources are measured in more than four spectral bands  only one in more than six bands  and a two - component greybody model with power - law emissivity in general has six free parameters ) and to a fundamental degeneracy between a broadened temperature distribution and a shallower emissivity power - law .    in this paper",
    "we consider high - fidelity measurements in seven frequency bands of the two galaxies nearest to ours : the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "all of the measurements are at frequencies @xmath20 ghz .",
    "the measurements at @xmath21 ghz are taken from the publicly available data from the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) satellite , while the measurements at @xmath22 ghz are new results from the tophat instrument .",
    "the irregular dwarf galaxies known as the magellanic clouds are the most prominent extragalactic features in the southern sky and have been observed for hundreds of years in many spectral bands ( for a summary , see @xcite or @xcite ) . despite the proximity of these two galaxies , there exist relatively few observations of them in the fir or in continuum sub - millimeter or microwave bands .",
    "studies of dust in the magellanic clouds have been done using extinction measurements @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate dust grain size distributions in the magellanic clouds and our galaxy and find that the distribution shape and large - radius cutoff are similar in the two environments .",
    "the product of grain size distribution and emissivity per grain increases with grain size in the two types of grains in the weingartner & draine model ( silicates and carbonaceous ( graphite ) grains ) up to a cutoff at @xmath23 for silicates and @xmath24 for graphites . based on this work , we assume grains large enough to be in thermal equilibrium with the irf will dominate the emission at @xmath25 ghz from the magellanic clouds .",
    "attempts have been made to characterize the dust in the magellanic clouds using _ iras _ data alone , @xcite , while @xcite combined _ iras _ data with single scans across the lmc and smc with a ground - based millimeter - wave receiver operating from antarctica .",
    "_ iras _ observed the entire sky at @xmath26 resolution in four spectral bands centered at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ghz ( 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100@xmath29 ) .",
    "however , _",
    "iras _ was designed to detect point sources , and though large - area sky maps have been created from _ iras _ data ( issa images , @xcite ) , large zero - point and calibration drifts across these maps render them unsuitable for determinations of absolute flux in regions as large as the magellanic clouds .",
    "dirbe extended the frequency range of _ iras _ with two lower - frequency channels ( @xmath30 ghz ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ghz ( @xmath33 ) ) and was specifically designed to measure diffuse emission , so the zero - point and absolute calibration are more well - behaved and well - characterized .",
    "the angular resolution of dirbe is @xmath34 , which is well - matched to characterizing the integrated dust properties of the magellanic clouds , which have angular extents on the order of degrees .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter sfd98 ) have combined _ iras _ and dirbe @xmath9 ghz ( 100@xmath29 ) data to produce a full - sky model with @xmath26 resolution and the stability of the dirbe data .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter fds99 ) use dirbe @xmath32 ghz data and data from the _ cobe _ far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) to extend this model to longer frequencies , but they exclude the magellanic clouds from the extended model . @xcite and @xcite use dirbe data and the sfd98 model to characterize the dust in the smc , and @xcite find that some combination of components at temperatures between @xmath35 and @xmath36 and an emissivity proportional to @xmath37 fits the combined _ iras_/dirbe",
    "/ sfd98 data at @xmath38 ghz .",
    "similar analyses have not been published for the integrated dust emission from the lmc .",
    "we report here a measurement of the spectra of integrated flux relative to the background of the lmc and smc .",
    "we report separate results for the lmc with the active star - forming region 30-doradus ( the tarantula nebula ) masked off and for 30-doradus alone .",
    "this measurement is based on observations made with tophat and dirbe , and spans the range 245  -3000  ghz .",
    "we report calibrated spectra ( in jy , @xmath39 ) of all three regions .",
    "we fit the calibrated spectra to a single - component greybody emission model with power - law emissivity and report a best - fit optical depth , temperature , and emissivity power - law index for each region .",
    "these new measurements provide data which span a gap in our knowledge of the lmc and smc integrated spectra .",
    "the dust emission properties are complicated by neither stochastic , non - equilibrium dust grain heating nor resonance emission , which are important factors at frequencies above 3 thz .",
    "in addition , the sub - mm measurements in the rayleigh - jeans portion of the dust emission permit an estimation of the dust mass .",
    "in particular , if a steep emission spectrum is indicated for theoretical reasons , a large mass of cold gas would be required to match the flat sub - mm spectrum reported here .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section [ sec : instrument ] describes the tophat instrument and observations and section [ sec : dataanalysis ] describes the reduction of raw tophat data to uncalibrated sky maps and uncertainties . section [ sec : fluxanalysis ] describes the flux analysis performed and the regions selected .",
    "section [ sec : dirbe ] explains how we treat the dirbe data and combine it with the tophat observations .",
    "the tophat calibration and the effect of the dirbe calibration uncertainties are discussed in section [ sec : calibration ] , and the final calibrated fluxes with errors are given in section [ sec : calibratedfluxes ] .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of these results and compare to results from the literature in section [ sec : discussion ] , and we discuss applications of these results and future work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "tophat @xcite is a balloon - borne telescope designed to measure millimeter astrophysical emission over a large area of sky .",
    "tophat is an on - axis cassegrain telescope with a 1 m aluminum primary and a secondary mirror suspended on six kevlar fibers .",
    "the beam was designed to be an approximately @xmath40 fwhm top hat , and ground measurements of the beam profile were consistent with the predicted shape .",
    "in addition , ground measurements were performed of the far sidelobe response , and the rejection was measured to be @xmath41  db at angles greater than @xmath42 from the optical axis , and @xmath43  db at angles greater than @xmath44 .",
    "the instrument is mounted on top of a scientific balloon , with a gondola providing support electronics , power , and telemetry hanging beneath .",
    "the telescope and a conical radiation shield are mounted on a rotating azimuthal mount , with the optical axis fixed at a @xmath45 inclination from the rotation axis .",
    "observations are made by rotating the mount at a constant rate of one rotation per 16 sec .",
    "observing at latitude , the scan pattern as the earth rotates becomes a series of interlocked circles whose centers circumscribe the south celestial pole ( scp ) once each sidereal day .",
    "the nominal observed region is then approximately a diameter circle , centered on the scp .",
    "the actual scan pattern obtained was more complicated and covered a slightly larger area due to a tilt of the telescope from horizontal and the rotation of the balloon .",
    "the instrument observes a single pixel in five spectral bands , each with a single detector .",
    "the band is defined by an ir absorber , resonant grid beam splitters , and band defining filters . in this work",
    ", we define the center frequency of the band @xmath46 as an effective rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) frequency by @xmath47^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the transmission of the band .",
    "the center frequencies are then 175 , 245 , 400 , 460 , and 630  ghz , with @xmath49 in the two lowest - frequency channels and @xmath50 in the highest three . the spectral bandpasses were determined before the flight using fourier transform spectrometry ; the bandpasses of the four highest - frequency bands , which are used in this analysis , are shown in figure [ fig : bandpass ] .",
    "the width of the bands leads to appreciable color corrections for source spectra that differ appreciably from rj .",
    "these corrections are incorporated into spectral fits as described in section [ sec : calibration ] ; the calculation of the corrections themselves ( for both tophat and dirbe ) is discussed in appendix [ app : colorcorrections ] .",
    "the detectors are five silicon bolometers with ion - implanted thermistors cryogenically cooled to 270  mk by a @xmath51he cryostat ; the dewar and its internal electronics are described in detail in @xcite and @xcite . the band at 175  ghz is not used in this analysis because of excess noise .",
    "the telescope is not actively pointed .",
    "the location of the beam is reconstructed after the flight using a two - axis tilt meter , gps information , and the location of the sun as determined by four small imaging telescopes on the radiation shield of the telescope , which record the sun position four times each rotation .",
    "a pointing model was constructed which uses the data from these sensors and depends on a small number of parameters to locate the spin axis and the beam .",
    "the parameters are determined by a multi - dimensional fit of the observations containing the galaxy to a map .",
    "the observations of the magellanic clouds are not used in the pointing fit ; rather , we take the reproducibility of their location on repeated observations as independent evidence of the quality of the pointing model .",
    "the rms pointing errors are determined to be @xmath52 , much smaller than the beam , and are negligible for this analysis .",
    "tophat was launched from mcmurdo station , antarctica at 06:55 ut 2001 january 4 by the national scientific balloon facility ( nsbf ) .",
    "after an initial checkout , sky observations began at 14:10 ut 2001 january 4 and continued until 14:00 ut 2001 january 8 when the cryogens were exhausted .",
    "all observations occurred at a float altitude of @xmath53  km .",
    "the telescope was turned off on 2001 january 10 , and the balloon cut down and the flight disks recovered on 2001 january 31 .",
    "the observations consist of a nearly circular patch of sky centered at the south celestial pole ( scp ) , approximately @xmath54 in radius , or about 6% of the sky , re - observed four times over the course of @xmath554 sidereal days . because of interruptions in the observations for system checks , the data exists in only three continuous sections .",
    "in addition , data taken during the first 16 hours of observation proved unusable due to long - settling transients in many of the systems .",
    "we have divided the remaining observations into two independent sets , denoted epoch i and epoch ii , with approximately equal observing weight , so that all steps in the analysis may be performed on both epochs and the results compared .",
    "these divisions are summarized in table [ tab : observingtimes ] .",

    "the raw radiometer data are reduced by constructing a minimum variance fit of the timestream to a sky map . prior to mapmaking",
    ", the data are processed as follows . cosmic ray strikes and other anomalies",
    "are removed from the time stream data and the instrument transfer function is deconvolved .",
    "then instrumental effects in the data are identified ; large instrumental signals of various kinds which are localized in time are excised and ignored in further analysis , while scan - synchronous instrumental signal is dealt with by fitting the timestream simultaneously to the sky and a model of this scan - synchronous signal . and contaminated data either cut or an appropriate model constructed by which the contaminant may be removed in a simultaneous fit .",
    "the timestream noise is estimated iteratively from a series of intermediate fit residuals . a model of the telescope pointing is constructed and its parameters fit to minimize the map errors .",
    "the final sky map is a vector @xmath56 , produced by a linear fit to the accepted data in the cleaned timestream @xmath57 which minimizes the @xmath58 function @xmath59 where @xmath57 is the cleaned data timestream , @xmath60 is the pointing matrix , a function of the pointing parameters @xmath61 , which is supplemented by model templates to account for instrumental effects , and @xmath62 is the inverse of the time - time noise covariance matrix , @xmath63 .",
    "the pointing matrix is pixelized using healpix @xcite with pixels @xmath64 on a side .",

    "maps are produced for both epochs separately . in the following , we marginalize @xmath66 over sky pixels which do not lie in the fields of interest and over all instrumental parameters .",
    "tophat has no absolute reference for the power coming from the sky ; it is sensitive only to flux differences between different positions .",
    "our formal uncertainty on any quantity with a nonzero projection onto a constant sky flux is infinite ; therefore we must construct a purely differential quantity to estimate .",
    "the integrated flux from an extended source minus the integrated flux from a surrounding set of pixels with the same total solid angle as the source is such a quantity .",
    "this approach is particularly appropriate in the case that the flux from the on - source pixels is a combination of the source emission and emission from a relatively uniform , optically thin foreground ; then the differential measurement gives the flux from the source only .",
    "there is some evidence of systematic contamination above the random noise level in the tophat data , particularly in spatial modes which are a function of declination ( dec ) only .",
    "a large spin synchronous instrument signal is fit out of each channel s timestream simultaneously with the best - fit map .",
    "while the pixel - pixel correlations induced by this instrument model are included in the pixel covariance matrices used in the flux analysis , the model lacks sufficient fidelity to remove the spin - synchronous signals completely , leaving a small residual spin synchronous signal improperly subtracted and unaccounted for in the covariance matrix .",
    "the symmetry of our scanning strategy naturally projects any residual spin synchronous signal mainly onto spatial modes in the map that are functions of declination only . for this reason",
    ", we have constructed the on- and off - source regions to have the same number of pixels on each iso - latitude ring in the healpix `` ring '' pixelization , rendering the difference between on- and off - source flux insensitive to these potentially contaminated modes .",
    "we arrange the off - source pixels symmetrically around the on - source pixels so that the differential flux is also insensitive ( to first order ) to other long - wavelength modes that we do not wish to include in this measurement , such as the cmb dipole .",
    "the diameters of the on - source regions ( chosen to be circular for convenience ) were optimized for the `` target '' magellanic cloud regions by varying the diameter around an initial value selected by eye to enclose the particular high - contrast area of the dirbe 1250  ghz map and noting when the slope of the enclosed flux versus diameter tends to zero .",
    "this process is not used to optimize the 30-doradus on - source region because it is itself embedded in a high - contrast region .",
    "the diameter of the 30-doradus on - source region is chosen by eye .    having chosen the source region and a background region satisfying the above conditions , we then extract from the full map @xmath56 and covariance matrix @xmath66 ( equations [ eq : map ] and [ eq : noisecovariance ] ) the pixels corresponding to the on and off - source regions .",
    "this is done separately for the two epochs .",
    "we denote the vector of extracted pixel values @xmath68 , and the matrix of extracted pixel - pixel covariances @xmath69 .",
    "the weighting vector @xmath70 is defined such that it is 1 for the on - source pixels and -1 for the off - source pixels .",
    "we then calculate , for each channel , the quantity @xmath71 with a corresponding error variance of @xmath72 we demonstrate the insensitivity of the weighting vector @xmath70 for the lmc , smc , and 30-doradus regions to low spatial frequency modes by giving the normalized projections + @xmath73 of various modes @xmath74 onto the weight vector @xmath70 in table [ tab : lowfreqproj ] .",

    "however , in this analysis we have chosen the conservative approach of making all source regions large compared to an upper limit on the beam size determined by assuming the beam is the size of the most compact bright sources we can find in our maps .",
    "these most compact sources are no more than one degree fwhm , and all source regions in this analysis are at least two degrees in diameter . because of the very high sidelobe rejection of the telescope , the contribution of the brightest off - axis sources ( the sun and the galaxy ) are negligible .",
    "in addition to the source regions of the lmc , smc , and 30-doradus , we have selected five regions of appreciable galactic dust emission which are out of the galactic plane and one `` blank '' region on which to perform the flux analysis . the galactic dust regions are used in the calibration , discussed in section [ sec : calibration ] .",

    "the blank region is chosen such that its differential brightness is consistent with zero in the dirbe @xmath32 ghz channel .",

    "for example , if in fact there is a distribution of temperatures in the smc with @xmath164 and @xmath165 , the inferred dust mass will be an order of magnitude higher due to the `` hidden '' cold dust component .",

    "though it is difficult to obtain robust information about global properties of these regions ( such as total dust mass ) from these results , the results are intriguing as a potential road map for characterizing the emission in these frequencies across many types of galaxies .",
    "if the statistics of emission from extragalactic environments in these frequencies could be accurately described by distributions in a few simple parameters , it would be a boon to groups seeking to probe structure formation by associating the correlation properties of the cosmic infrared background with the distribution of dusty protogalaxies at various redshifts ( c.f .",

    "<S> we present measurements of the integrated flux relative to the local background of the large and small magellanic clouds and the region 30-doradus ( the tarantula nebula ) in the lmc in four frequency bands centered at 245 , 400 , 460 , and 630  ghz , based on observations made with the tophat telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these observations with the corresponding measurements for the dirbe bands 8 , 9 , and 10 to cover the frequency range 245  - 3000  ghz ( @xmath0 ) for these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we present spectra for all three objects and fit these spectra to a single - component greybody emission model and report best - fit dust temperatures , optical depths , and emissivity power - law indices , and we compare these results with other measurements in these regions and elsewhere . using published dust grain opacities , we estimate the mass of the measured dust component in the three regions . </S>"
