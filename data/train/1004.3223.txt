    "the structure of nonassociated liquids such as liquid nitrogen or liquid argon can be understood in terms of packing of molecules @xcite : the structure is primarily determined by hard - core repulsive ( excluded - volume ) interactions and not by specific , directional intermolecular interactions .",
    "further , the thermodynamics of such fluids admits a mean - field ( van der waals type ) approximation @xcite ( see also fig .  1 in ref .",
    "in contrast , for an associated liquid like water , the attractive interactions are strong and specific , revealing themselves , for example , in the approximately tetrahedral ordering of water molecules around a central water molecule @xcite . in such a case ,",
    "the observed structure and thermodynamics reflects both packing interactions and local , chemically specific interactions between molecules . to understand the structure and thermodynamics of liquid water , it is thus imperative to understand the balance between packing effects and local , attractive interactions .",
    "recent developments in molecular statistical thermodynamics @xcite allow a detailed examination of the competing roles of packing and local , chemically involved interactions in the physics of hydration .",
    "these efforts are founded on regularizing@xcite the statistical problem of calculating the excess chemical potential of the solute using the potential distribution theorem@xcite . by introducing a spatial scale",
    " here the coordination radius of interest  the interaction of the solute with the solvent is separated into a local , chemically interesting piece and a long - range piece .",
    "the coordination radius can be adjusted such that the distribution of energies from the long - range interaction piece admits a simplified description @xcite .",
    "this then helps focus the attention on the local problem solely .",
    "the local contributions to hydration are accounted for by the work of expelling the water molecules from within the coordination sphere in two limits , one in the presence of solute - solvent interactions and the other with those interactions turned off .",
    "the former gives the chemical contributions to hydration whereas the latter accounts for packing contributions .",
    "( we will refer to the coordination sphere without the solute as the observation volume . ) from a simulation record , the chemical contribution can be obtained by noting the probability , @xmath0 , of observing no water molecules in the coordination sphere .",
    "likewise , the packing contribution is obtained from the probability , @xmath1 , of observing an empty observation volume  a cavity  in bulk water . the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values are , respectively , the @xmath2 members of the set @xmath3 and @xmath4 of occupancy number ( @xmath5 ) distributions in the coordination sphere and the observation volume .    for coordination radii",
    "that are chemically meaningful for the solute of interest , the distribution of coordination states @xmath3 below the most probable coordination state indicate the relative contribution of those states to the local , chemically involved contributions to hydration @xcite .",
    "likewise the distribution @xmath4 provides important insights into the hydrophobic aspects of hydration @xcite . for observation volumes with radii in the range 2.0 - 3.5   , @xmath4 is found to be nearly gaussian @xcite . in this case , the variance of @xmath4 , and hence also the excess chemical potential of the cavity , is expected to scale linearly with the volume of the cavity @xcite .",
    "( this scaling relation proves insightful in the analysis below . )",
    "earlier , for a classical , empirical model of liquid water , based on an analysis of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 distributions it was found that the packing and chemical contributions balance at a coordination radius of about 3.3   @xcite . at that point , the net hydration free energy is entirely determined by non - specific interactions between the water molecule and the bulk liquid outside the coordination sphere @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for liquid water simulated with the revpbe functional within constant @xmath6 _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics @xcite . in that study , because of limited data , using the more robustly determined mean and variance of the number distributions , a maximum entropy approach was used to secure @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "further , relative to water simulated with the revpbe functional , it was found that the enhanced structure obtained using the pbe functional correlated with attractive interactions outweighing packing effects .",
    "there were two main limitations in the earlier _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics study @xcite .",
    "first , the simulations with the revpbe and pbe functionals were at different average temperatures ( 314  k and 337  k , respectively ) , confounding any clear comparison between the functionals .",
    "second , the total simulation time was small , being less than 15  ps for any one functional under study . in the present work ,",
    "we address both those limitations .",
    "we implement a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) method @xcite , an approach that guarantees that we sample from a canonical ensemble without in any way influencing the forces obtained using the functional under study .",
    "the simulations are also conducted for a longer time ( about 170  ps ) .    in the following section ,",
    "we briefly summarize the statistical thermodynamic theory and recapitulate main ideas of the hmc method . in section  [ sc : methods ] we outline the methods used .",
    "for the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , we implement the hmc method as a script that interfaces with the publicly available cp2k code @xcite . in section  [ sc : results ] we present the results of our study . for water simulated with blyp , the packing contribution shows a scaling behavior that is not expected of a homogeneous liquid material , whereas it does so for water simulated with revpbe at 300  k and with blyp and blyp - d at 350 k. with scaled particle theory as a reference @xcite , these results suggest that the density ( pressure ) of the liquid simulated with blyp at 350  k and revpbe at 300  k is somewhat higher than normal .",

    "[ eq : xnpn ] is best seen for the @xmath2 case : @xmath18 the packing contribution , @xmath19 , is the free energy of forming an empty observation volume of a defined radius , a hard sphere ( hs ) , in bulk water .",

    "( the relation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the equilibrium constant for forming a solute plus @xmath5-water cluster within the coordination sphere and @xmath24 is the density of water @xcite , provides an alternative perspective on the chemical contributions to @xmath0 . )      the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) method combines elements of monte carlo and molecular dynamics approaches and has been well - established in the literature @xcite .",

    "the canonical configurations of this system can be generated by conventional ( metropolis ) monte carlo : we make a one - particle move and accept or reject that move based on the standard metropolis criterion .",
    "the metropolis criterion also specifies the temperature of the system . to better explore configurational space",
    "it would be desirable to make multiple moves at a time , but such an approach is rather inefficient in conventional monte carlo .",
    "the hmc method removes this inefficiency by combining the effectiveness of molecular dynamics to generate @xmath25-particle ( global ) moves with the effectiveness of monte carlo in rigorously generating a canonical distribution @xcite .",
    "one sweep of the hmc consists of @xmath32 molecular dynamics time steps of propagation through phase space starting from the configuration @xmath33 .",

    "the change with temperature is in the right direction .    in comparing the present results to other simulation results ,",
    "some aspects need to be emphasized .",
    "first , the response to temperature will sensitively depend on the water model ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "second , the response will sensitively depend on the simulation ensemble , especially when small system sizes are involved . with these caveats ,",
    "observe that the location and magnitude of the first maximum for blyp 300  k falls between nve ensemble results @xcite reported at an average temperatures of 292  k and 318  k. ( the uncertainty in temperature was reported to be about @xmath7110  k around the average temperature @xcite . )",
    "however , the agreement is less encouraging at 350  k ( figure  [ fg : grblyp ] , right panel ) .",
    "the dependence of the thermal and the mechanical response of the liquid on the thermodynamic state point may underlie the observed difference .",
    "for example , the thermal expansion coefficient of water increases with temperature @xcite and as does the compressibility beyond about 320  k. ( this likely also explains why in this study for revpbe  300  k a more structured pair - correlation function is obtained in comparison to the earlier @xmath6 ensemble study @xcite of a 32 water molecule system at a temperature of @xmath72  k. ) comparing the present results to those from an earlier monte carlo study , m05 in figure  [ fg : grblyp ] @xcite ( and also ref.@xcite ) , suggests that the peak of the correlation function obtained in that study is somewhat lower .",
    "( the location of the peaks are nearly the same . ) .",
    "several factors may underlie the observed differences .",
    "first , the temperatures are different ( figure  [ fg : grblyp ] ) .",
    "second , a larger system was used in the earlier study @xcite .",
    "the impact of system size will sensitively depend on the water model used .",
    "( we will return to this aspect below in discussing figure  [ fg : pnscaled ] . ) for example , with the spc / e water model , the pair - correlation approaches the bulk almost after the first hydration shell ( figure  [ fg : grall ] ) and both 32 and 64 particle simulation cells give essentially identical pair - correlation functions . but",
    "as figure  [ fg : grall ] suggests , the correlations appear more pronounced for water simulated with blyp and these correlations can be expected to persist for longer length scales leading to more pronounced system size effects .",
    "third , the different methodologies may be a factor . in the earlier monte carlo study @xcite , an empirical potential was used as an importance function to sample configurations@xcite .",
    "( that empirical potential was parameterized against a car - parrinello simulation@xcite . )",
    "but it is not clear if the empirical model was a good reference model@xcite for the target system studied .",

    "[ fg : xnx0 ] ( right panel ) depicts the variation of the chemical contribution to the excess chemical potential for various coordination radii . for a chemically reasonable coordination radius ,",
    "the coordination states below the most probable coordination state reveal the importance of local interactions @xcite .",
    "as figure  [ fg : xnx0 ] ( left panel ) suggests , relative to spc / e , the probability of the @xmath73 states drops sharply for blyp 300  k. this suggests that blyp 300  k leads to a somewhat tighter binding of the distinguished water molecule to the neighboring water molecules . if the local , cohesive interactions were weaker , we expect to observe a greater proportion of the @xmath73 states .",
    "comparing blyp 300  k and blyp 350  k shows that weakening the local , cohesive interactions does indeed elevate the proportion of the @xmath73 states . comparing @xmath21 for chemically meaningful coordination radii",
    "shows that the work of expelling water molecules from within the coordination shell is more for blyp 300  k than for any other case .",
    "further , across all coordination states and coordination radii , the blyp - d  350 k best follows the spc / e results .    figure  [ fg : pnp0 ] ( left panel ) gives the occupation statistics in an observation volume of radius 3   . comparing blyp  300  k and blyp  350",
    "k shows that increasing the temperature makes it harder to open a cavity in liquid water .",
    "this is as expected , since the disorder in the medium increases with increasing temperature .",
    "( as an aside , this observation also explains why the solubility of hydrophobic solutes decreases with increasing temperature @xcite . )",
    "including additional attractive interactions mitigates the effect of increasing temperature , a trend more clearly seen in the behavior of @xmath74 ( figure  [ fg : pnp0 ] , right panel ) .      to facilitate the discussion below ,",
    "we first collect several observations about occupancy number distributions , the predicted scaling of the packing contribution based on theory , and number distributions and system size effects .    in liquid water , for observation volumes of radii between about 1.5   to 3.5   , the occupation number distribution is found to closely approximate a gaussian @xcite .",
    "( the approximation is much better for the smaller radii . )",
    "physically this means that at the size - scale of the observation volume , the presence of one molecule anywhere in the observation volume has only a modest ( or little ) effect in inducing the presence of another molecule in the volume .",
    "but as we increase the size of the observation volume , more of the network structure of water @xcite comes into focus , and the occupation number is no longer gaussian . in this instance , the presence of one water does induce the presence of another molecule in the volume .",
    "theory @xcite suggests that when the occupation number is approximately gaussian , the excess chemical potential of the empty observation volume ( the cavity ) scales with the volume of the cavity . on the other hand ,",
    "the excess chemical potential of a large cavity depends on the surface area of the cavity .",
    "this scaling arises because at the large length scale ( @xmath75   ) , the free energy is effectively the work it takes to create the interface . for the larger cavities , the preference for preserving hydrogen - bonding outweighs the need to accommodate the cavity @xcite in the liquid matrix .",
    "the occupation number distributions will be sensitive to system size effects .",
    "the number variation reflect positional fluctuations ( of the molecules ) and these will always be constrained in a constant volume simulation . in practice we find ( merchant and asthagiri , in preparation ) that system size effects manifest for observation spheres with a volume greater than about 3% of the box volume .",
    "( for system sizes considered here , this amounts to an observation sphere of radius @xmath76 2  . ) for cavities larger than this size , the excess chemical potential will be more positive than what would be obtained at constant pressure and/or large system sizes .",
    "the revised scaled particle theory @xcite provides the packing contributions for cavities of various sizes in the large system limit .    from figure  [ fg : pnscaled ] , we find that the packing contribution ( @xmath77 ) for blyp  350  k and revpbe  300  k is above the scaled particle result for @xmath78   .",
    "the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath8 is still linear , but the rate of increase is greater than that predicted theoretically .",
    "this indicates the onset of system size effects , and suggests that the pressure in the fluid is higher than normal .",
    "thus in a constant temperature _ and _ pressure simulation of these systems , we would expect a lower density . a recent report @xcite using the blyp functional at a temperature of 330  k and a pressure of 1  bar does indeed find a lower density for the fluid .",
    "the present results are consistent with that observation .",
    "( although the temperature in that study was lower than the one here , we suspect that the above noted trend will hold . )",
    "compared to both blyp 350  k and revpbe  300  k , system size effects set in somewhat later in blyp - d  350  k , just as they do for spc / e .",
    "the trend for blyp is striking . for @xmath8 between 2.5 to 3.0  ",
    ", the packing contribution scales with the surface area of the cavity , a scaling behavior that is not predicted to arise until after @xmath80   .",
    "( at that size scale , this behavior reflects the need for water molecules to maximize their bonding by de - wetting the interface @xcite . ) this unexpected behavior clearly reflects non - gaussian occupation statistics ( cf .  figure  [ fg : pnp0 ] , left panel ) , and suggests the presence of heterogeneities , perhaps strongly bonded pairs or other such clusters of water molecules , in the liquid .",
    "( the more negative chemical contribution in blyp 300  k water supports this suggestion . ) on the basis of temperature effects of water simulated with blyp , an earlier report@xcite found deviations of the diffusion coefficient from an arrhenius behavior at temperatures around 300  k. heterogeneities in the liquid can lead to such behavior and our results appear to corroborate the earlier study . a thorough analysis of the nature of heterogeneities / network structure of the liquid @xcite will require a much larger system , preferably one where there are at least 3 - 4 hydration layers around a central water .",
    "finally , for a somewhat larger cavity , @xmath81   , @xmath79 once again begins to increase with @xmath8 , as must be expected , since the volume of the system is constant .",
    "figure  [ fg : xopo ] ( left panel ) shows the sum of the inner - shell chemistry and packing contributions obtained using the simulation data ( figs .  [ fg : xnx0 ] and  [ fg : pnp0 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : xopo ] ( right panel ) are information theory@xcite estimates .",
    "consistent with the above discussion , we find that local chemistry outweighs packing for blyp 300  k. as an _ extreme _ approximation , if we assume that outer contribution is same for all the cases , then on the basis of the simulations we expect that the excess chemical potential of water simulated with blyp is about 4  @xmath82s more negative than the spc / e value ( @xmath83  kcal / mol , merchant and asthagiri , unpublished ) .",
    "for all the other cases , relative to the spc / e value , the excess chemical potential will be more positive by about a @xmath84 .",
