    "the problem of exact controllability for  , was in the focus of attention of many researchers starting from the early nineties , and it is now rather well understood .",
    "namely , it was proved that , given a time  @xmath14 and a smooth solution  @xmath15 of  , with @xmath16 , for any initial function  @xmath17 sufficiently close to  @xmath18 one can find a control @xmath19\\to{{\\mathcal e}}$ ] such that the solution of problem  , supplemented with the initial condition @xmath20 is defined on  @xmath21 $ ] and satisfies the relation @xmath22 .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for the exact statements and the proofs of these results .",
    "even though the property of exact controllability is quite satisfactory from the mathematical point of view , many problems arising in applications require that the control in question be feedback , because closed - loop controls are usually more stable under perturbations ( e.g. , see the introduction to part  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "this question has found a positive answer in the context of stabilization theory .",
    "it was intensively studied for the case in which the target solution  @xmath15 is stationary ( in particular , the external force is independent of time ) .",
    "a typical result in such a situation claims that , given a smooth stationary state  @xmath15 of the navier  stokes system and a constant  @xmath23 , one can construct a continuous linear operator @xmath24 with finite - dimensional range such that the solution of problem     with @xmath25 and a function  @xmath17 sufficiently close to  @xmath15 is defined for all  @xmath26 and converges to  @xmath15 at least with the rate  @xmath27 .",
    "we refer the reader to the papers  @xcite for boundary stabilization and to  @xcite for stabilization by a distributed control .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish a similar result in the case when the target solution  @xmath15 depends on time .",
    "namely , we will prove the following theorem , whose exact formulation is given in section  [ s : nonlinear ] .",
    "note that this theorem remains true for the two - dimensional navier  stokes system , and in this case , it suffices to assume that the initial function  @xmath17 is close to  @xmath18 in the @xmath28-norm .",
    "furthermore , the approach developed in this paper applies equally well to the case when the control acts via the boundary .",
    "this situation will be addressed in a subsequent publication .    as was mentioned above",
    ", the problem of feedback stabilization is rather well understood for stationary reference solutions .",
    "let us explain informally the additional difficulties arising in the non - stationary case and reveal a common mechanism of stabilization .",
    "a well - known argument based on the contraction mapping principle enables one to prove that a control stabilizing the linearized problem locally stabilizes also the nonlinear equation .",
    "thus , it suffices to study the linearized problem .",
    "the main idea in the stationary case is to split it into a system of two autonomous equations , the first of which is finite - dimensional and has the zero solution as a possibly unstable equilibrium point , whereas the second is exponentially stable due to the large negative eigenvalues of the laplacian .",
    "one then applies methods of finite - dimensional theory ( e.g. , the pole assignment theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2.5 ) ) to find a stabilizing feedback control for the first equation and proves that using the same control in the original problem yields an exponentially decaying solution ; see  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to apply this approach in the case of time - dependent reference solutions , because a non - autonomous equation does not necessarily admits invariant subspaces .",
    "however , the above - mentioned scheme for stabilization is based essentially on the so - called foia ",
    "prodi property for parabolic pde s",
    "@xcite . it says , roughly speaking , that if the projections of two solutions to the unstable modes converge to each other as time goes to infinity , then the difference between these solutions goes to zero .",
    "it turns out that the conclusion remains true if the projections are close to each other at times proportional to a fixed constant .",
    "the main idea of this paper is to choose a control that ensures the equality at integer times for the projections of two solutions to the unstable modes .",
    "more precisely , we consider the following problem obtained by linearizing  , around a non - stationary solution  @xmath29 : @xmath30 let us assume that , for a sufficiently large integer  @xmath31 , we have constructed a continuous linear operator @xmath32 such that , for any initial function  @xmath33 , the solution of   with @xmath34 issued from  @xmath33 satisfies the relation @xmath35 , where  @xmath36 stands for the orthogonal projection in  @xmath28 onto the subspace spanned by the first  @xmath31 eigenfunctions of the stokes operator in  @xmath2 . in this case , using the poincar inequality and regularizing property of the resolving operator for  , we get @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the increasing sequence of the eigenvalues for the stokes operator and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , are some constants not depending on  @xmath31 . the fact that  @xmath41 is independent of  @xmath31 is a crucial property , and its proof is based on a truncated observability inequality ( see section  [ s5.3 ] in appendix ) .",
    "it follows from   that , if  @xmath31 is sufficiently large , then @xmath42 .",
    "iterating this procedure , we get an exponentially decaying solution .",
    "once an exponential stabilization of the linearized problem   is obtained , the existence of an exponentially stabilizing feedback control can be proved with the help of the dynamic programming principle .",
    "we refer the reader to section  [ s : lin ] for an accurate presentation of the results on the linearized equation and some further comments on the existence of lyapunov function , derivation of a riccati equation for the feedback control operator , and the dimension of controllers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : prelim ] , we introduce the functional spaces arising in the theory of the navier  stokes equations and recall some well - known facts .",
    "section  [ s : lin ] is devoted to studying the linearized problem . in section  [",
