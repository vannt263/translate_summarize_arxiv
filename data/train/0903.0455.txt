    "the exclusive semileptonic decay processes of heavy mesons generated a great excitement not only in extracting the most accurate values of cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix elements but also in testing diverse theoretical approaches to describe the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "the great virtue of semileptonic decay processes is that the effects of the strong interaction can be separated from the effects of the weak interaction into a set of lorentz - invariant form factors , i.e. , the essential informations of the strongly interacting quark / gluon structure inside hadrons .",
    "thus , the theoretical problem associated with analyzing semileptonic decay processes is essentially that of calculating the weak form factors .",
    "in particular , along with the experimental study planned both at the tevatron and at the large hadron collider(lhc ) , the study of the @xmath6 meson has been very interesting due to its outstanding feature ; i.e. , the @xmath6 meson is the lowest bound state of two heavy ( @xmath10 ) quarks with different flavors .",
    "because of the fact that the @xmath6 meson carries the flavor explicitly , not like the symmetric heavy quarkonium ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) states , there is no gluon or photon annihilation via strong interaction or electromagnetic interaction",
    ". it can decay only via weak interaction .",
    "since both @xmath13-and @xmath14-quarks forming the @xmath6 meson are heavy , the @xmath6 meson can decay appreciably not only through the @xmath15(@xmath16 ) transition with @xmath14 quark being a spectator but also through the @xmath17(@xmath18 ) transition with @xmath13 quark being a spectator .",
    "the former transitions correspond to the semileptonic decays to @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons , while the latter transitions correspond to the decays to @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons .",
    "the latter transitions are governed typically by much larger ckm matrix element ; e.g. , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , vs. @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "for this reason , although the phase space in @xmath27 transitions is much smaller than that in @xmath28 transitions , the @xmath14-quark decays provide about @xmath29 to the decay width of @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath13-quark decays and weak annihilation add about 20@xmath30 and 10@xmath30 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that both @xmath13-and @xmath14-quark decay processes contribute on a comparable footing to the @xmath6 decay width .",
    "there are many theoretical approaches to the calculation of exclusive @xmath6 semileptonic decay modes .",
    "although we may not be able to list them all , we may note here the following works : qcd sum rules  @xcite , the relativistic quark model  @xcite based on an effective lagrangian describing the coupling of hadrons to their constituent quarks , the quasipotential approach to the relativistic quark model  @xcite , the instantaneous nonrelativistic approach to the bethe - salpeter(bs ) equation  @xcite , the relativistic quark model based on the bs equation  @xcite , the qcd relativistic potential model  @xcite , the relativistic quark - meson model  @xcite , the nonrelativistic quark model  @xcite , the covariant light - front quark model  @xcite , and the constituent quark model  @xcite using bsw(bauer , stech , and wirbel ) model  @xcite and isgw(isgur , scora , grinstein , and wise ) model  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend our light - front quark model(lfqm )  @xcite based on the qcd - motivated effective lf hamiltonian to calculate the hadronic form factors and decay widths for the exclusive semileptonic @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays and the magnetic dipole @xmath33 transition . in our previous lfqm analysis  @xcite , we have analyzed the meson mass spectra  @xcite and various exclusive processes of the ground state pseudoscalar(@xmath34 ) and vector(@xmath35 ) mesons such as the @xmath36 semileptonic heavy / light meson decays  @xcite , the rare @xmath37 decays  @xcite , and the magnetic dipole transitions of the low - lying heavy / light pseudoscalar / vector mesons  @xcite . in those analyses",
    ", we found a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , since we did nt analyze the @xmath6 and @xmath8 mesons yet , we shall extend our lfqm to predict the masses and the decay constants of @xmath6 and @xmath8 mesons as well as the above mentioned exclusive decays of @xmath6 and @xmath8 mesons .",
    "our lfqm  @xcite analysis in this work has several salient features : ( 1 ) we have implemented the variational principle to the qcd motivated effective lf hamiltonian to enable us to analyze the meson mass spectra and to find optimized model parameters .",
    "the present investigation further constrains the phenomenological parameters and extends the applicability of our lfqm to the wider range of hadronic phenomena . ( 2 ) we have performed the analytical continuation from the spacelike region to the physical timelike region to obtain the weak form factor @xmath3 for the exclusive semileptonic decays between the two pseudoscalar mesons as well as to obtain the decay form factors @xmath38 for @xmath39 transitions . the drell - yan - west(@xmath40 ) frame ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) is useful because only the valence contributions are needed unless the zero - mode contribution exists .",
    "the form factor @xmath3 can be obtained just from the valence contribution in the @xmath42 frame without encountering the zero - mode contribution  @xcite . however , the form factor @xmath4 receives the higher fock state contribution(i.e .",
    ", the zero - mode in the @xmath5 frame or the nonvalence contribution in the @xmath43 frame ) within the framework of lf quantization .",
    "thus , it is necessary to include either the zero - mode contribution(if working in the @xmath5 frame ) or the nonvalence contribution(if working in the @xmath43 frame ) to obtain the form factor @xmath4 . in this work ,",
    "we utilize our effective method presented in  @xcite to express the zero - mode contribution as a convolution of zero - mode operator that we find in this work with the initial and final state lf wave functions . in this way",
    ", we calculate the form factor @xmath4 in the @xmath5 frame with the perpendicular components of the currents and discuss the lf covariance of @xmath4 in the valence region by analyzing the covariant bs model and the lf covariant analysis described by jaus  @xcite .",

    "iii , we briefly describe the formulation of our lfqm and the procedure of fixing the model parameters using the variational principle for the qcd motivated effective hamiltonian .",
    "the masses and decay constants of the @xmath8 and @xmath6 mesons are predicted and compared with the data as well as other theoretical model predictions .",

    "the zero - mode contribution to the form factor @xmath4 is also discussed . in sec .",
    "v , the decay form factor @xmath47 for the @xmath48 transition and the decay width for @xmath33 are presented .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath49 needed for the calculation of the decay width for @xmath33 is determined in the limit @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 . for the numerical calculation of the semileptonic and radiative decays , the form factors @xmath52 for the semileptonic decays and @xmath47 for the @xmath48 transition are analytically continued to the timelike @xmath53 region by changing @xmath54 to @xmath55 in the form factor . in sec .",
    "vi , our numerical results ( i.e. , the form factors and decay rates for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 decays ) are presented and compared with the experimental data as well as other theoretical results .",
    "summary and discussion follow in sec.vii .",
    "the amplitude @xmath59 for a semileptonic decay of a meson @xmath60 with the four - momentum @xmath61 and the mass @xmath62 into another meson @xmath63 with the four - momentum @xmath64 and the mass @xmath65 is given by [ sa ] a = v_q_1|q_2l_h^ , where @xmath66 is the fermi constant , @xmath67 is the relevant ckm mixing matrix element , @xmath68 is the lepton current [ lmu ] l_=|u___(1-^5)v _ , and @xmath69 is the hadron current [ hmu ] h^=p_2,|(v^-a^)|p_1 . here , @xmath70 is the polarization of the daughter meson and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the vector and axial vector currents , respectively .",
