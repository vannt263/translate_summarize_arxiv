    "quantum dissipation is a problem with such a long history and such a multitude of results that even a cursory review will not make justice to the numerous contributions of a large number of authors over several decades .",
    "we recommend the reader to consult refs . @xcite and the references therein . in spite of this impressive effort",
    ", many people do not consider the problem of quantum dissipation a solved issue , and its character and microscopic origin still call for the attention of a large community across many , if not all , subfields of physics .",
    "the present paper represents a continuation of our effort to understand the character of energy flow between the slow degrees of freedom and the intrinsic degrees of freedom in many  body systems .",
    "our initial motivation was to understand the `` irreversible '' time evolution of the large amplitude nuclear collective motion @xcite and for that reason we have adopted a traditionally nuclear physics approach .",
    "the large body of evidence , both experimental and theoretical , suggests that many fermion systems can be described reasonably well within the framework of a random matrix formalism .",
    "another way of saying the same thing is that a many fermion system is predominantly a quantum chaotic system and thus a random matrix approach is a natural approach . at the same time , both theory and experiment strongly suggest that there are some degrees of freedom , which are not chaotic and usually are referred to as collective or shape .",
    "however these collective degrees of freedom are coupled with a large number of non  collective degrees of freedom and as a result a rather generic situation results : a relatively small quantum system in contact with an `` environment '' . even though the whole system is finite and in a strict sense",
    "there is no irreversible behaviour in this case , for all practical purposes the time evolution of the collective or slow quantum system has the character of quantum dissipative dynamics . in our formulation",
    ", we will neglect other physical mechanisms which lead to dissipative contributions , such as particle evaporation or coupling to electromagnetic fields .",
    "this can be viewed as limiting the present study to shorter time scales .",
    "such phenomena can in principle be introduced into the formalism , but we shall not attempt it here .",
    "we shall not either try here to defend the legitimacy of such a terminology ( dissipation ) , the issue at stake however is unquestionably sound .",
    "the reader will recognize easily that the problem we address here is typical and under different guises appears in many subfields of physics .    as an introduction ,",
    "let us consider for the moment that a certain simple system interacts with some relatively large ( but finite ) many  body system .",
    "the question is : can one describe the dynamical behaviour of the simple system using for example an equation of the form @xmath0 as in the case of a brownian particle , if in the absence of the interaction the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath1 and where @xmath2 is a friction coefficient and @xmath3 is a langevin  like force ?",
    "the force @xmath3 can in principle depend not only on time but on position as well , and in this way one can describe a large variety of physical situations , ranging from diffusion to localization @xcite . if one were to start from a description of the entire system ( reservoir plus simple system ) with a hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes the reservoir and its interaction with our system , under what circumstances could one derive an equation of motion like eq.([eom ] ) ?",
    "moreover , does the fluctuating force have gaussian character or not ?",
    "since our approach is a fully quantum mechanical one , we shall be able to answer another important question , on the specific role played by the quantum effects .",
    "as we shall show , the classical results are recovered when the appropriate limits are taken , however , the classical limit is not at all a trivial one nor is it reached in a simple fashion . if one were to take the approach of postulating that an equation of the type eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) governs the dynamics and assume for example that the fluctuation properties of @xmath3 are gaussian in character , then the entire powerful apparatus developed for brownian motion could be then invoked @xcite .",
    "but such an approach would leave unanswered the main questions of whether one can describe in this way collective degrees of freedom in a finite closed system , like atomic nuclei .",
    "we address this problem using a well known approach based on the double path integral formulation of feynman and vernon @xcite .",
    "our original input is in the functional form of the influence functional , which arises from a parametric random matrix description of the `` environment '' .",
    "this has been attempted earlier in ref .",
    "the functional form for the influence functional we determine is qualitatively different from the popular caldeira  leggett type derived by feynman and vernon @xcite .",
    "the parameters which define the influence functional have a rather simple and intuitive meaning from a microscopic point of view and we refer the reader to earlier publications for details and discussions @xcite .",
    "it comes as no surprise than that under such circumstances the dynamical evolution of a quantum dissipative system in our case has new features as well , as we shall amply exemplify in the body of the paper . here",
    "we restrict our attention to the markovian limit only and we hope to address the important problem of memory effects in the future . in spite of its physical restrictions ( high temperature limit for the intrinsic system )",
    "this limit shows already the qualitative differences with the previously known approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the time evolution equation for the density matrix of the `` slow '' quantum system coupled to a complex many  body system . in section iii",
    "we show that , at high temperatures , the evolution equation for the density matrix can be brought to the kramers form , when the classical limit is taken .",
    "sections iv  vii discuss exact solutions to the evolution equations for certain potentials .",
    "section viii is devoted to the study of the tunneling problem .",
    "a short summary and discussion of the results is given in the final section .",
    "in this section we discuss the description of the internal degrees of freedom ( or complex environment ) through parametric random matrix theory , and derive the equation of motion for the density matrix of the slow degrees of freedom by integrating over the internal states .",
    "the basic assumption concerning the intrinsic states is that there are no governing constants of the motion , so that the dynamics is chaotic .",
    "this has been seen to be the general situation in studies of many ",
    "body systems , from nuclei to molecules , so it is reasonable to approach the modelling of these degrees of freedom with random matrices , suitably tailored to the problem . the generic form of the hamiltonian governing the dynamics of a `` slow '' quantum system coupled to a complex environment is described as follows @xmath6 we shall often refer to @xmath7 as `` shape '' variables , since in large amplitude collective nuclear motion it represents the collective coordinates which characterize the nuclear mean field .    the part of the total hamiltonian eq .",

    "we refer in the main text to these eigenstates as `` typical states '' of the intrinsic system with an energy @xmath12 .",

    "whereas in statistical physics the interaction between the thermostat and the system under consideration is assumed to be negligible , we shall not make such an approximation here . as a matter of fact , for the physically interesting situations we envision",

    ", @xmath16 has a roughly exponential behaviour . recall that @xmath17 is approximately proportional to the thermodynamic entropy of the intrinsic system , which is an extensive quantity .",
    "the fact that the average density of states for the intrinsic subsystem has such a behavior is a key element of the entire approach .",
    "this is equivalent to stating that the intrinsic subsystem has a large heat capacity and thus can play the role of a `` reservoir '' , although not necessarily ideal . in principle @xmath16",
    "can be @xmath7dependent as well , but we shall ignore this aspect here . without an @xmath7dependence of the average density of states ,",

    "our limitation to the zeroth and first order terms in @xmath60 for the coupling between the `` slow '' subsystem and the `` reservoir '' can consequently be interpreted as a semiclassical approximation .",

    "this at once is indicative of the presence of higher than second order cumulants in the spatial distribution , but most of all of the fact that the spatial distribution has a wider spread than the corresponding one obtained in traditional approaches . if one were to perform a taylor expansion of the integrand in powers of @xmath155 to determine the cumulants for example",

    "unfortunately the rest of our argument concerning the behaviour of the spatial distribution is pure qualitative at the present time . in the classical transition theory the flux through the barrier",
    "is controlled by the probability population of the states at the top of the barrier . with decreasing friction coefficient",
    ", the thermalization of the spatial distribution in the classically allowed region is less effective and as a result the overall flux through the barrier decreases as well . in the previous section",
    "we have established that the energy distribution has generally wider tails than a pure boltzmann distribution and thus states with higher energies have a higher relative probability to be populated when the coupling strength between the `` reservoir '' and the subsystem is finite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that tunneling states would have a higher relative occupation probability in our approach .",
    "overall the effect of an effective momentum dependent friction coefficient is likely to lead to an enhancement of the tunneling probability when compared with the classical kramers result . since the role of the pure quantum effects and the role of the finite coupling strength to the `` reservoir ''",
    "are intimately related , we can not at the present time disentangle the specific role played by each one of them separately .",
    "for the problem of tunneling , we consider also the dynamical evolution of a particle in the double well potential given by : @xmath344 for this or more complex potentials , analytic solutions are no longer possible .",

    "12 , we plot the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues as a function of temperature for the ones with the smallest imaginary component .",
    "one observes that the imaginary part of the eigenvalue with the smallest nonvanishing absolute value apparently vanishes in the limit @xmath360 .",
    "this is consistent with caldeira and leggett s conclusion @xcite that at @xmath361 dissipation decreases the tunnelling rate .",
    "this is not true however at high temperatures , as one can see .",
    "we have developed a dynamical theory of simple quantum systems coupled to complex quantum environments , where the environment is a general `` chaotic '' bath of intrinsic excitations .",
    "the model hamiltonian we introduce for the intrinsic subsystem incorporates the generic properties of finite many  body systems .",
    "this includes an average level density of states sharply increasing with energy , the presence of universal spectral ( or random matrix ) fluctuations for the intrinsic system and the variation of these properties while changing the `` shape '' of the intrinsic system modeled with parametric banded random matrices . in this way , the intrinsic system is capable to easily absorb energy due to its large heat capacity . we did not yet allow the intrinsic system to perform mechanical work , but this feature can be readily implemented .",
    "we are able to solve the dynamical evolution equations for these systems , without making any uncontrollable approximations or assumptions . using the feynman ",
    "vernon path integral approach , we derive the random matrix influence functional , and an evolution equation for the density matrix of the `` slow '' subsystem at finite , but high temperatures .",
    "this evolution equation is surprisingly easy to manipulate and in many instances one can construct full solutions by quadratures , for cases when the corresponding path integral can be computed only by brute force .",
    "the entire treatment is performed at the quantum level .",
    "we have shown on the other hand that in the classical limit , the evolution equation reduces to the kramers form .",
    "our analysis was limited to the case when the motion of the simple system can be treated in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "thus , we have not taken advantage of another parameter in our description of the reservoir , the bandwidth of the random matrix @xmath185 .",
    "it is well known that banded random matrices lead to localization @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore whether localization in the `` reservoir '' states induces localization in the simple quantum system coupled to such a reservoir .",
    "( one can show that for finite bandwidths @xmath185 the influence functional in our model can be brought to a form similar to the one suggested by cohen @xcite to describe localization , although we did not analyze this limit here . )",
    "the quantum evolution equation we have derived for the density matrix is not more complicated than a classical fokker ",
    "planck equation . however , this evolution equation describes processes which first of all are quantum in nature and moreover have manifestly non  gaussian features .",
    "so although we started with a gaussian process characterized by our parametric random matrices , we ended up with a non  gaussian dynamical process . unlike traditional approaches",
    ", we have not assumed that the coupling to the `` reservoir '' is vanishingly small . in particular , this is one of the reasons why the diffusion process acquires a non  gaussian character .",
    "the spatial and momentum distributions are characterized by high order cumulants , which increase exponentially with the order . as we have discussed earlier @xcite",
    ", this is indicative of the fact that the corresponding distributions have longer tails than previously expected . in order to put in evidence such features , one ought to be careful about the order in which the various limits are taken .",
    "if one takes the semiclassical limit first in the evolution equation for the density matrix , such features are lost .",
    "if in the actual quantum solution one takes either the semiclassical limit ( @xmath108 ) or the limit of weak coupling to the reservoir ( either @xmath362 or / and @xmath177 ) then one recovers the standard results as well .",
    "we have thus shown that , at least in the framework of the present model ( which we believe to be sufficiently generic ) , both semiclassical and weak coupling limits have a rather singular character , which is seen in the temporal domain or / and the phase space distributions .",
    "the particular form of the quantum evolution equation we have discussed in this paper has one rather unneccessary restriction , based on the `` translational invariant '' form of the influence functional we have used , see eq .",

    "one can easily convince oneself that this form we have assumed can be easily amended and , to within some approximation , a more general quantum evolution equation for the density matrix of the `` slow '' subsystem can be derived , namely : @xmath363 +   i \\gamma ^\\downarrow \\left [ g ( x , y)-1\\right ] \\right \\ } \\rho ( x , y , t )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath364 and where the correlator @xmath365 satisfies the only symmetry requirements @xmath366 .",
