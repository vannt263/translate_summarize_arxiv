    "in recent years the idea that the ground state of nuclear matter at high density contains a bose condensate of kaons has received considerable attention .",
    "the existence of this novel state of matter is suggested by the attractive _",
    "s_-wave kaon - nucleon interactions found in low energy effective chiral lagrangians , which , by construction , preserve the symmetries of qcd .",
    "this is supported experimentally by kaonic atom data which indicate @xcite a strongly attractive @xmath1 optical potential .",
    "attractive kaon - nucleon interactions imply that in dense matter , such as that in the interior of neutron stars , the effective kaon mass is lower than in free space .",
    "it could thus be energetically favorable for leptons in the matter to convert to kaons via strangeness changing interactions , in which case the lowest energy kaon mode becomes macroscopically populated , forming a condensate .    since the original suggestion by kaplan and nelson@xcite , studies of kaon condensation and kaon propagation in the nuclear medium",
    "can broadly be divided into three categories : studies of the basic interactions , consequences for heavy - ion collisions and astrophysical implications .",
    "a number of studies have been aimed at improving the description of kaon - nucleon interactions over that of the original model .",
    "brown , lee , rho and thorsson@xcite included all terms to next - to - leading order ( @xmath2 ) in chiral perturbation theory , and fitted the expansion parameters to @xmath3 scattering lengths .",
    "lee , brown , min and rho@xcite included all terms to next - to - next - to - leading order ( @xmath4 ) in chiral perturbation theory and also fitted kaonic atom data .",
    "have also included the @xmath5 ( which dominates the low - energy @xmath6 interaction ) , four - baryon interactions , and pauli blocking .",
    "other noteworthy studies are those of ref.@xcite , concerning the effect of kaon - nucleon correlations , and the work of the kyoto group ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "waas , kaiser , and weise@xcite have recently investigated kaon modes in matter using a multichannel k - matrix analysis . for our purposes , it is worth mentioning that the majority of these more refined investigations have shown that the basic mechanism for kaon condensation , namely the existence of an attractive interaction , is robust .",
    "as regards heavy ion collisions , strangeness is conserved on the relevant timescales and a kaon condensate is not likely to form .",
    "however , modification of the kaon modes following from the chiral lagrangian could have consequences in kaon flow@xcite , for subthreshold production of kaons@xcite , or for the @xmath7-meson peak in dilepton spectra@xcite .",
    "another major direction that investigations have taken is to study the astrophysical consequences of the formation of a kaon condensate ( the effects appear to be reduced if hyperons are also present @xcite , a possibility that we do not consider here ) .",
    "the presence of such a condensate considerably enhances the proton concentration which leads to a softer equation of state ( eos ) and a lower maximum mass for the cold neutron star .",
    "the actual value of this maximum mass is dependent on the nuclear eos , but for the non - relativistic eos employed here it is quite close @xcite to the lower limit of @xmath8 set by psr 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "an interesting effect occurs when the neutron star has just formed since electron neutrinos are trapped for about 1015 s ( also the entropy / baryon is @xmath9 , but this plays a lesser role ) .",
    "the changes in the stellar composition induced by trapping increase the threshold for kaon condensation .",
    "this stiffens the eos and allows a maximum mass which is @xmath10 larger than in the absence of trapped neutrinos .",
    "thus there is the possibility of metastable neutron stars which become black holes after about 1015 s when the trapped neutrinos have left @xcite .",
    "this could account for the fact that fewer pulsars are observed in supernova remnants than expected from conventional scenarios @xcite . as regards dynamical simulations @xcite of the delayed collapse of hot neutron stars into black holes , baumgarte , shapiro and teukolsky@xcite",
    "have recently examined the effect of kaon condensates . here",
    "the cold eos is supplemented with simple assumptions about corrections for finite temperature .",
    "one - loop calculations to date are valid only up to the density at which the condensate forms where the condensate amplitude is vanishingly small . in order to go beyond threshold",
    "we analyze the fluctuations around the kaon condensate to one loop order and include the full non - linearities of the lagrangian .",
    "this is of general theoretical interest , as well as in the particular context of neutron stars .",
    "while we shall restrict our numerical analysis here to the zero - point contribution at zero temperature , the formalism also provides a consistent treatment of the thermal contributions due to kaons .",
    "these would be needed in studies of newborn neutron stars .    in the work which follows",
    ", we shall make the following approximations .",
    "nucleons are treated non - relativistically , whereas a more complete treatment would involve a relativistic treatment to one loop order . in the meson sector , we restrict the discussion to kaonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus omit from the discussion fluctuations in the pion and eta sectors .",
    "physically one might argue that ignoring non - kaonic pseudoscalar degrees of freedom is justified since one expects that the corresponding modes are less modified in nuclear matter than those of kaons .",
    "the methods developed here could be used to include the full octet of pseudoscalar fluctuations , but this would further complicate the present analysis .",
    "lastly , we have sought to treat the chiral lagrangian at the most simple level starting from the lagrangian of kaplan and nelson @xcite , although one would wish to include the additional terms of refs .",
