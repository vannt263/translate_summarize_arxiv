    "high - mass star forming regions are usually at far distances , heavy obscuration makes it difficult to observe them .",
    "the water masers are good probes of physical conditions and dynamics of the star forming regions .",
    "maser vlbi observations are the unique mean by which one can explore the gas kinematics close ( within tens or hundreds of au ) to the forming high - mass protostar ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* moscadelli et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of water masers found in high - mass star - forming regions by vlbi reference method can provide very accurate distance of them . combining positions , distances , proper motions and radial velocities yields complete 3-dimensional kinematic information of the galaxy ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "water masers are very rich in the galaxy , they are reliable tracers of high - mass star - forming regions ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* caswell et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "therefore , it is valuable to discover more water masers associated with high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "earlier water maser searches have chiefly been made to targeted sources , many masers may not be discovered .",
    "there are only a few unbiased water maser surveys ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "recently , one much larger blind survey toward 100 square degree of southern galactic plane has been completed successfully ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* walsh et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "however , no large blind water maser survey has been done toward northern galactic plane .",
    "we will make a blind survey toward 90 square degree of the northern galactic plane using our 25 m radio telescope .",
    "we hope to discover a large sample of water masers and high - mass star - forming regions at earlier stages , and study high - mass star formation and galactic structure .",
    "nanshan 25 m radio telescope of xinjiang astronomical observatory was built in 1992 as a station for the chinese very long baseline interferometry network .",
    "it is located at nanshan mountains west of urumqi city at an altitude of 2080 m .",
    "its front - end receiver system includes several receivers working at 18 , 13 , 6 , 3.6 and 1.3 cm . at 1.3 cm",
    ", one dual - polarization cryogenic receiver has been installed on the telescope recently , the noise temperature of the receiver is better than 20k . when weather is good , the system temperature is better than 50k .",
    "we built a molecular spectrum observing system in 1997 .",
    "one digital filter bank ( dfb ) system is employed as the spectrometer , it is is capable of processing up to 1 ghz of bandwidth with 8192 channels .",
    "our telescope now can observe several molecules such as oh , h@xmath0o , nh@xmath1 , h@xmath0co and h@xmath2 .",
    "we will make a large scale blind survey toward northern galactic plane . for that most water masers concentrated in the region along the galactic plane ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we plan to survey 90 square degrees of the northern galactic plane , it covers the region between l=30@xmath4 and l=120@xmath4,and @xmath3 . in order to complete the project in reasonable time , scan observation mode ( on the fly )",
    "will be used in our observation , and final sensitivity of the survey is about 1.4jy .    on the other hand",
    ", many surveys at millimeter , submillimeter , infrared wavelengths discovered a large sample of possible star - forming regions , e.g. bolocam , planck , glimpse and mips .",
    "these sources provide us good candidates for searching water masers .",
    "we also can select some sources and make targeted survey .",
    "this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china under grant @xmath5 , china ministry of science and technology under state key development program for basic research ( 2012cb821800 ) and the national natural science foundation of china under grant @xmath6 ."
