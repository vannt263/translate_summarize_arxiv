    "the optical glauber actually gives total participant number of less than 1 for that centrality cut , thus leading to particle production below the p - p level .",
    "given the different determinations of centrality in the approaches , a good way to compare the data to the calculation is to divide out by the overall number of participant pairs .",

    "<S> the success of nonviscous hydrodynamics in describing the collective flow properties of bulk low @xmath0 observables at rhic has led to the claim that a novel form of _ strongly coupled _ quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) is created in 200 agev au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this success depends strongly , however , on the initial conditions assumed in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , agreement with data is only obtained assuming glauber nuclear reaction plane ( participant ) geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the kln model of color glass condenstate ( cgc ) initial conditions require the existence of nonvanishing viscous effects . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an improved model of cgc that is more internally consistent between the central and diffuse edge regions . </S>",
    "<S> the improved model is shown to describe bulk rapidity distributions for a wide assortment of system sizes , geometries and energies . </S>",
    "<S> the self consistency forces a specific @xmath1 dependence of the multiplicity which leads to surprisingly low particle production predictions for pb+pb collisions at lhc com energies . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are similar to those made using simple linear extrapolations of multiplicity attempted by the phobos collaboration . </S>"
