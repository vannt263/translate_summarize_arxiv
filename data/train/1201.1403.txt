    "the time for ` speculation ' was soon coming to an end ! our imagination about the possible dynamics behind electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , disciplined by the constraints from electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) , has fueled different directions of theoretical studies and experimental searches over the last so many years .",
    "finally , the lhc has roared into life , and this is our last chance of putting money on our favorite models .",

    "@xmath25 can be as small as 14 in this region ( as against 33 for cmssm ) .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 the origin of fine - tuning lies in the smallness of weak scale compared to the soft masses , and in this region it is hard to reduce fine - tuning .",

    "what is expected in the higgsless scenario ? here , the exchange of kk states would retard the energy growth of the @xmath160-@xmath160 scattering amplitude , _ postponing _ the violation of unitarity in a",
    "_ calculable _ way beyond a tev .",
    "more specifically , @xmath161 tev for @xmath162 tev .",
    "if we want to postpone the onset of unitarity violation even further , we have to decrease the @xmath163 mass .",
    "but this , in turn , increases the @xmath85 parameter , implying a tension between unitarity and ewpt @xcite .",
    "( @xmath164 )   * lhc signature : *   we deal with a specific signature here @xcite .",
    "consider the scattering channel @xmath165 .",
    "if @xmath166 gev , it turns out that @xmath167 .",
    "we then expect to see sharp resonance due to @xmath48 channel mediation , with a striking feature of narrow width ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ f_higgsless]b .",
    "@xmath0   * little higgs vs composite : *   little higgs models were introduced to solve the little hierarchy problem , but these models , as we saw before , are still quite fine - tuned .",
    "moreover , the higgs mass has a quadratic cutoff sensitivity at two - loop level .",
    "the composite higgs does much better in both these aspects .",
    "it can have a proper uv completion all the way to @xmath168 and the higgs mass is finite at all order due to non - locality .    at an observational level",
    ", the composite higgs model contains kk gluon ( as it is dual to a 5d gauge theory ) , while a conventional little higgs model does not have a kk gluon .",
    "fine - tuning in a composite model boils down to ensuring that @xmath169 .",
    "the new resonances in composite models weigh around @xmath170 , where @xmath171 could be as large as @xmath172 .",
    "so the new resonances are heavy enough and their effects on ewpt normally die out .",
    "but there is a subtle point here which differentiates composite higgs from the conventional little higgs .",
    "the composite higgs couplings to the gauge bosons are different from the corresponding sm couplings .",
    "these couplings pick up a factor @xmath173 after the higgs kinetic term is canonically normalized . as a result",
    ", the smooth cancellation of log divergence between the higgs and gauge boson contributions to the @xmath46 and @xmath85 parameters does not hold any more , yielding an ir contribution @xmath38 @xmath174 to the ewpt parameters @xcite .",
    "this contribution is numerically very important , but a value of @xmath173 fine - tuned to approximately @xmath175 keeps the ewpt constraints under control . in conventional little higgs models ,",
    "the new heavy states weigh around @xmath176 , where @xmath145 is the sm gauge coupling , and consequently the new resonances are not heavy enough .",
    "therefore the little higgs resonances pose a threat to overshoot the ewpt constraints .",
    "@xmath1   * composite vs higgsless / technicolor : *   in the technicolor model , qcd - like strong dynamics breaks electroweak symmetry _",
    "directly_. the 5d higgsless model can be seen as dual to the ` walking technicolor ' . in a composite higgs model",
    ", the strong sector does _ not directly _ break electroweak symmetry , but just delivers a composite pseudo - goldstone boson , the higgs , which gets a potential at one - loop and triggers electroweak breaking .",
    "this two - stage breaking , creating the parameter @xmath173 , turns out to be a boon while facing ewpt constraints .",
    "the @xmath46 parameter in a composite higgs model is under control and , in fact , suppressed by the factor @xmath142 compared to the value of @xmath46 in the higgsless model .",
    "@xmath2   * interpolation : *   the composite higgs scenario interpolates between the sm and the higgsless ( or , technicolor ) models in the two extreme limits of @xmath173 @xcite :    @xmath177",
    "all the bsm models we have considered are based on _",
    "calculability_. @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of some high scale parameters @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath178 , where @xmath179 are calculable functions of physical parameters .",
    "the new physics scales originate from different dynamics in different cases : @xmath180 ( the supersymmetry breaking scale ) ; @xmath181 ( the vev of @xmath137 breaking ) ; @xmath182 ( the inverse radius of compactification ) .",
    "* 2 . *   in supersymmetry",
    "the cancellation of quadratic divergence takes place between a particle loop and a sparticle loop .",
    "since a particle and a sparticle differ in spin , the @xmath183 parameters and the @xmath184 vertex correction can be kept under control , since new physics appear through loops . in the little higgs scenario",
    "the cancellation occurs between loops with the same spin states .",
    "such states can mix among themselves , leading to dangerous tree level contributions to the oblique parameters .",
    "this is the reason why a decoupling theory like supersymmetry is comfortable with ewpt , while a technicolor - like non - decoupling theory faces a stiff confrontation .",
    "we have a three - fold goal while building bsm physics : @xmath0 unitarize the theory , @xmath1 successfully confront ewpt , and @xmath2 maintain as much naturalness as possible .",
    "the tension arises as ` naturalness ' demands the spectrum to be compressed , while ` ewpt compatibility ' pushes the new states away from the sm states .",
    "supersymmetric theories are getting increasingly fine - tuned with non - observation at lhc ( having said that , we must realize that lhc direct searches do not apply for third generation matter superfields , and so a spectrum with inverted hierarchy is relatively less tuned ) .",
    "naturalness in mssm improved when we added extra singlets and additional terms in the superpotential .",
    "although supersymmetry solves the big hierarchy problem by stabilizing the weak scale over many decades in energy scale , the little hierarchy problem continues to haunt and instigate the model builders to take bold , sometimes outrageous , steps for reducing the fine - tuning .    *",
    "5 . *   a light higgs",
    "need not necessarily be elementary .",
    "it can very well be a composite object .",
    "also , a narrow width of higgs does not necessarily attest its elementarity .",
    "a light composite higgs can very well have a narrow width . just finding the higgs would not settle this issue .",
    "we need to measure the higgs couplings very precisely to know whether it is elementary or composite .",
    "*   lhc is a ` win - win ' discovery machine .",
    "if we find the higgs , it will be a great discovery .",
    "but if we see only the higgs and nothing else , we will definitely be disappointed as many of our questions would be left unanswered @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , lhc confirms that there is no higgs , it will be no less a discovery @xcite .",
    "if the higgs is not there , the new resonances which would restore unitarity in gauge boson scattering should show up , with a prior hint of excess events in @xmath185 scattering . in that case",
    "we absolutely need the super - lhc , and eventually the ilc , to confidently establish the nature of the new resonances .",
    "*   the excluded region in bsm parameter space is growing fast as lhc accumulate more and more data @xcite . by the time we meet in the next lepton photon conference in 2013 ,",
    "many of the possibilities discussed here may not perhaps be heard again ! but who can rule out the possibility that completely new theoretical ideas inspired by yet unseen unexpected observations during the next two years would form the cornerstone for building the physics of the tev scale ?    _ note added : _   on 13 december 2011 at cern , the atlas and cms experiments presented their update on the higgs searches .",
    "the sm higgs mass is now allowed in a narrower window : @xmath186 gev at 95% c.l . with a mild excess around 125 gev .",
    "the main ethos of this talk remains unaffected by this observation .",
    "the only observation we can make at this stage is that if the higgs mass is later confirmed to be around 125 gev , some of the supersymmetric models we have discussed would require more tuning than before .",
