    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "first of all , we would like to give an introduction to the beautiful combinatorics related with box - ball systems , and secondly , to relate the latter with the `` classical combinatorics '' revolving around transportation matrices , tabloids , the lascoux  schtzenberger statistics charge , macdonald polynomials , @xcite,@xcite , haglund  haiman ",

    ", we will prove that two statistics naturally appearing in the context of box - ball systems , namely _ energy function _ and _ tau - function _ , have nice combinatorial properties .",
    "more precisely , the statistics energy @xmath4 is an example of a generalized machonian statistics @xcite , section  2 , whereas the statistics @xmath5 related with kostka  macdonald polynomials , see section  5.2 of the present paper .    box - ball systems ( bbs for short ) were invented by takahashi ",
    "satsuma @xcite as a wide class of discrete integrable soliton systems . in the simplest case ,",
    "bbs are described by simple combinatorial procedures using box and balls . despite its simple outlook",
    ", it is known that the bbs have various remarkably deep properties ;    * time evolution of the bbs coincides with isomorphism of the crystal bases @xcite .",
    "thus the bbs possesses quantum integrability .",
    "* bbs are ultradiscrete ( or tropical ) limit of the usual soliton systems @xcite .",
    "thus the bbs possesses classical integrability at the same time .",
    "* inverse scattering formalism of the bbs coincides with the rigged configuration bijection originating in completeness problem of the bethe states @xcite .",
    "let us say a few words about the main results of our paper .",

    ", our main result can be formulated as a computation of the corresponding partition function for the bbs in terms of the values of the kostka ",
