    "since the first heavy ion experiments the size of the largest cluster @xmath0 detected in multifragmentation events has been tentatively associated to an order parameter for the fragmentation phase transition@xcite ; if this is true , we should expect for this observable a double humped distribution if the transition is first order@xcite , while its fluctuations should obey the first scaling law if the transition is continuous@xcite .",
    "experimental multifragmentation data show in this respect somewhat contradictory evidences .",
    "an analysis of 80 a.mev au+au peripheral collisions from the indra - aladin collaboration@xcite reports a bimodal distribution of a variable closely correlated to @xmath0 . on the other side",
    "the functional relationship between the two first moments of @xmath0 in central xe+cu collisions@xcite shows a change of slope which has been interpreted as a a transition from the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 scaling law as expected for a generic continuous transition@xcite . from the theoretical point of view , it is well known@xcite that in finite systems many different pseudo - critical behaviors can be observed inside the coexistence region of a first order phase transition . in particular concerning the order parameter fluctuations , simulations have been performed in the framework of the ising model with fixed magnetization ( imfm ) in ref.@xcite . in this",
    "study the distribution of @xmath0 was shown to approximately obey the first scaling law even at subcritical densities , i.e. in thermodynamic conditions where no continuous transition takes place . since the scaling is violated for very large lattices , the observed behavior was interpreted in this paper as a finite size effect that prevents to recognize the order of a transition in a small system .",
    "an important difference subsists though between the theoretical study of ref.@xcite and the experimental analysis ref.@xcite : in the first paper the average @xmath0 size is varied by increasing the total lattice size , meaning that the existence of a scaling law is tested in well defined thermodynamic conditions ( a single point in the ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) state variables space ) . in the experimental case",
    "it is not possible to freely vary the source size , therefore different regions of @xmath5 are explored by varying the total energy deposited in the fragmenting system .",
    "it is not a priori clear how these two very different procedures might be related and whether they could be equivalent .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the distribution of @xmath0 within the lattice gas model@xcite .",
    "this model is the simplest representation of the liquid - gas phase transition ; once augmented with the cluster definition through the coniglio - klein algorithm@xcite , it can also be related to a bond and site percolation problem , making this model a paradigm of the fragmentation phase transition .",
    "this model is isomorphous to the ising spin model and its thermodynamic properties are very precisely known : the lattice gas phase diagram contains both first and second order phase transitions and basic effects , like conservation laws , which are very relevant to the experimental situation , can be easily implemented .    in the analysis of the @xmath0 distributions",
    "we will show that the most important finite size effect is the inequivalence between statistical ensembles@xcite : the observed ambiguities can be coherently interpreted as an effect of conservation laws , the distribution of an order parameter being drastically deformed if a constraint is applied on an observable which is closely correlated to the order parameter under study .",
    "specifically we will show that :    * in small canonical systems , a first scaling law as a function of the system size can be observed at the critical point but also for subcritical densities inside the coexistence region .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the difficulty in recognizing the order of the transition is not only due to the finite size effects but more important , the order parameter distribution and its scaling properties are deformed by the conservation law that in the canonical ensemble acts on the total number of particles @xmath6 , which strongly constraints the order parameter @xmath0 ; * if the @xmath0 size is varied by changing the system temperature at a fixed lattice size , no scaling of the largest fragment distribution is observed even if we choose a transformation which passes across the thermodynamic critical point ; * in this case , the correlation between the average @xmath7 and the variance @xmath8 of the largest fragment distribution exhibits a rise and fall which is imposed by the conservation law constraint ; the double logarithmic derivative @xmath9 appears to be a smooth decreasing function of @xmath7 ; even if @xmath10 is passing through @xmath11 and @xmath12 before becoming negative no simple scalings @xmath13 can actually be unambiguously isolated .",

    "however it is clear from figure [ fig1 ] that ( except at the critical point which is a second order point , where the two peaks merge to form a single distribution ) the first order character of the transition is indisputable even for a linear dimension as small as @xmath37 .",

    "the obvious correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath6 implies that for @xmath39 the @xmath0 distribution is also double humped in the grancanonical ensemble as explicitly shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath0 can also be taken as an order parameter of the liquid gas phase transition , and looking at its distribution this transition can be recognized as first order even for a system constituted of @xmath40 particles .",
    "if the constraint of mass conservation is implemented ( canonical lattice gas , or equivalently ising model with fixed magnetization ) the distributions of @xmath41 drastically change@xcite . in the grancanonical ensemble at @xmath42 , the explored microstates essentially populate the coexistence border , while the coexistence region is accessed with a negligible probability ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) ; these highly improbable of the grancanonical distributions are conversely the only microstates which are allowed by the canonical constraint at the value @xmath43 below the transition temperature the grand canonical and canonical partitions differ drastically . because of the mass conservation constraint , the bimodality of the @xmath6 distribution is obviously lost in the canonical ensemble ; as a consequence of the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath0 , the @xmath0 distribution also shows a unique peak ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if we additionally implement a total energy conservation constraint ( microcanonical ensemble , right part of figure [ fig2 ] ) the distributions get still narrower , but the qualitative behavior is the same than in the canonical ensemble",
    ". the normal behavior of the @xmath0 distribution at subcritical temperatures may intuitively suggest a pure phase or a continuous transition for the canonical model .",
    "this intuition is however false ; the characteristics and order of the transition do not depend on the statistical ensemble , and the phase diagram of figure [ fig1 ] is still pertinent to the canonical ensemble@xcite .",
    "indeed the relation between the two ensembles can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the partition sums in the two ensembles .",
    "eq.([equiv ] ) shows that in the whole region where the grancanonical distribution @xmath47 is convex , the canonical equation of state @xmath48 presents a back bending , which is an unambiguous signal of a first order phase transition@xcite . at each temperature",
    "the maxima of @xmath49 correspond to the two ending points of the tangent construction for eq.([eos ] ) , i.e. to the borders of the coexistence region in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the qualitative behavior of @xmath50 in the canonical ensemble does not change with the density of the system .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 fluctuation passes systematically through a maximum .",
    "the locus of these maxima is displayed on the phase diagram in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we can see that the maximum fluctuation approximately corresponds to the transition temperature only at the critical point . at subcritical densities",
    "this maximum lies inside the coexistence region of the first order phase transition .",
    "the results of figure [ fig2 ] show that the double hump criterium for a first order phase transition does not hold if a constraint is put on a variable closely correlated to the order parameter under study .",
    "we can ask the question whether a detailed study of the scaling properties of the @xmath0 distribution may give extra information on the transition and discriminate first and second order . following the arguments of ref.@xcite we consider the distribution @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the most probable value of @xmath0 and @xmath53 is a real number . at a continuous phase transition point the distribution of the order parameter is expected to fulfil the first scaling law , i.e. the distribution @xmath54 should be scale invariant with @xmath2 .",
    "the scale invariance of @xmath54 for a given value of @xmath55 is generically refered to as @xmath55 scaling , and the transition observed experimentally@xcite from a @xmath56 to a @xmath57 scaling by varying the centrality of the collision and therefore the energy deposited in the system , has been taken as a signal of a continuous phase transition .",
    "a practical difficulty in testing @xmath55 scaling is that for a given distribution the value of @xmath55 that corresponds to scale invariance , if any , can not be known a - priori .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented using the fact that the scaling ( [ delta_scaling ] ) imposed @xmath58 .",
    "then it is immediate to verify that eq.([delta_scaling ] ) can be equivalently written as the ensemble of the two conditions @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a scale invariant distribution and @xmath61 is a constant . since in presence of a scaling",
    ", the difference between the most probable @xmath62 and the average @xmath63 scales like @xmath64 , @xmath65 can either be one or the other . in the later case the occurence of @xmath55 scaling study coresponds to the invariance of the centered and reduced distribution .",
    "if this distribution does not show scale invariance , we can exclude the existence of any @xmath55 scaling law .",

    "this finding is in agreement with ref.@xcite .",
    "together with the analysis of the phase diagram this means that such a scaling also approximately applies in the coexistence region of a first order phase transition , if the order parameter is not free to fluctuate but is constrained by a conservation law .",
    "in the experimental application to nuclear multifragmentation@xcite the system size can not be varied as freely as in the lattice gas , since the maximum size for a nuclear system is of the order of 400 particles . to explore different values of @xmath68 ,",

    "no scaling is observed : the function @xmath60 continuously evolves from a distribution with a tail extending towards the low mass side compared to the average at low temperature while the opposite is true at high temperature .",
    "if we look at the behavior of the variance as a function of the first moment , the log - log correlation is nowhere linear showing that the large fragment fluctuation does not evolve like a power of the average fragment size .",
    "the bell shaped behavior of this curve is due to the mass conservation constraint , that forces the fluctuation to vanish both at low and at high @xmath68 values .",
    "the observed maximum is in fact the maximum fluctuation point shown in figure 1 which , at the critical density , occurs close to the critical point and , for sub - critical densities , is located inside the coexistence region .    to qualitatively compare with experimental @xmath55-scaling analysis , we have to remember that the studied experimental distributions only cover the multifragmentation regime and do not explore the decreasing part of the @xmath70 correlation which would correspond in the nuclear case to evaporation from a compound .",

    "the crossing point between the two power - law fits is interpreted as a `` transition '' point . by construction it appears to be at a higher temperature then the maximum fluctuation which at this critical density comes out to be close to the critical temperature .    to better study the possible occurrence of a power law scaling of the large fragment fluctuation we can study the double logarithmic derivative @xmath71 in presence of a",

    "indeed this regime has been shown to exhibit the second scaling law @xmath1 in the potts model@xcite ( or something close to it @xmath81 for the imfm@xcite ) , while in the representation of figure [ fig4 ] scaling can everywhere be excluded .",

    "as we have already stressed , these temperatures approximately coincide with the transition temperature only at the critical density ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the behavior at supercritical densities reflects a geometric phase transition which has no thermodynamic counterpart , while if fragmentation takes place at low density the @xmath0 drop can be taken as a signal of phase coexistence .    in order to discriminate between the different density regimes and recognize the order of the phase transition",
    ", we have to quantify the @xmath0 fluctuation peak . in the grancanonical ensemble ,",
    "the @xmath6 fluctuation is directly linked to the susceptibility via @xmath87 to work out a similar expression for the canonical ensemble , let us assume that @xmath0 and the other fragments are statistically independent , i.e. the total density of states is factorized @xmath88 where we have defined the total number of particles not belonging to the largest fragment as @xmath89 , and the corresponding energy @xmath90 .",
    "this hypothesis is reasonably well verified in the lattice gas model , since the correlation coefficient between @xmath41 and @xmath91 in the grancanonical ensemble comes out to be close to zero except in the very dense regime @xmath92 .",
    "the factorization of the state densities implies a convolution of the corresponding canonical partition sums    @xmath93    where @xmath94 describe the contribution of the largest fragment and of all the others respectively .",
    "the distribution of the largest fragment reads @xmath95    a gaussian approximation of this distribution leads to@xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the fluctuation of the @xmath41 distribution and the partial susceptibilities are defined as @xmath98 .    the above derivation is valid for a system whose state density depends on the two extensive variables , number of particles @xmath99 and energy @xmath100 . in the case of the fragmentation transition a third extensive variable , the volume @xmath101 , has also to be considered .",
    "we show in the appendix that in this more general case eq .",
    "( [ chineg1 ] ) can still be derived , but a dilute limit @xmath102 has to be considered .    according to the general definition of phase transitions in finite systems@xcite , the generalized susceptibility associated to an order parameter is negative in a first order phase transition in the statistical ensemble where the order parameter is subject to a conservation law .",
    "we therefore expect a negative @xmath103 at subcritical densities .",
    "imposing @xmath104 in eq.([chineg1 ] ) leads to @xmath105 comparing to eq.([macro ] ) this finally gives @xmath106 equation ( [ chineg2 ] ) associates the first order phase transition in the canonical ensemble to `` abnormal '' @xmath0 fluctuations , in the same way as abnormal partial energy fluctuations sign a first order phase transition in the microcanonical ensemble@xcite .",

    "vertical lines in the two left panels : limit of the region of negative susceptibility from the canonical @xmath107 equation of state eq.([eos ] ) @xcite . ]    the canonical and grancanonical fluctuations are compared in figure [ fig6 ] for three different densities .",
    "independent of the system density our approximation eq.([chineg2 ] ) turns out to be incorrect at very low temperatures , when the average size of the largest cluster ( dashed lines ) exceeds about 80% of the available mass . in this case the hypothesis of statistical independence between @xmath91 and @xmath41 can not be justified and the canonical mass conservation costraint trivially reduces the canonical fluctuation .",
    "however as soon as the average @xmath41 value drops , we can see that the region of negative susceptibility can be well reconstructed through eq.([chineg2 ] ) , and in particular its border ( vertical lines ) is very precisely determined by the equality condition between the two fluctuations . at supercritical densities",
    "the dilute gas approximation we have employed breaks down independent of the temperature and the susceptibility can not quantitatively be estimated from the fluctuation signal , however in this regime the relative fluctuation observable does not present any peak while only inside the spinodal region of the first order phase transition the canonical fluctuation exceeds the grancanonical one . it is clear that this observable allows a unambiguous discrimination between the supercritical regime and phase coexistence .",
    "to conclude , in this paper we have discussed the role of the largest fragment in the framework of the lattice gas model .",
    "we have shown that this variable can be taken as an order parameter of the fragmentation phase transition if this latter belongs to the liquid gas universality class .",
    "it has been already observed @xcite that the phase transition can be tracked from the sudden drop of @xmath0 close to the transition temperature .",
    "this drop is well fitted by a power law with a @xmath108 exponent close to the expected value for the liquid gas universality class@xcite but finite size effects blur the behavior considerably for system sizes comparable to accessible nuclear sizes . however , when no constraints are affecting the fluctuations of the order parameter such as in the grand canonical ensemble , we have shown that the transition is very well defined if instead of the average we look at the most probable value of @xmath0 . indeed crossing a first order phase transition point",

    "indeed the distribution of the order parameter is strongly deformed by the presence of conservation laws in the system under study .",
    "if we look at @xmath0 as an order parameter , the double hump criterium for a first order phase transition does not apply any more in the canonical or microcanonical ensemble because of the strong correlation between the conserved total number of particles and the order parameter .",
    "the mass conservation constraint induces a maximum in the fluctuation of @xmath0 which is not necessarily correlated with the properties of the phase diagram .",
    "we observe maxima both at the critical density close to the critical point and at sub - critical densities inside the coexistence zone .",
    "moreover , the presence of this maximum can simulate a transition from a @xmath2 to a @xmath1 scaling law in a region above the maximum fluctuation .",
    "it is clear that other observables have to be employed if we want to conclude about the order and nature of the phase transition .",
    "one such observable is the numerical value of the fluctuation of @xmath0 , which is by construction identical to the fluctuation of the number of particles that do not belong to the largest cluster @xmath91 : if and only if the system crosses the phase coexistence region of a first order phase transition , this fluctuation overcomes the corresponding value in the grancanonical ensemble .",
