    "the experiments at hera measure deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering in the previously unexplored small @xmath1 regime , @xmath4 . as usual , @xmath1 is the bjorken variable @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the four momenta of the incoming proton and the virtual photon probe respectively .",
    "the deep - inelastic observables reflect the small @xmath1 behaviour of the gluon , which is by far the dominant parton in this kinematic region .",
    "in particular the small @xmath1 behaviour of the structure function @xmath9 is driven by the @xmath10 transition . at such values of @xmath1 soft gluon emission and",
    "the associated virtual gluon corrections give rise to powers of @xmath11 , which have to be resummed . to leading @xmath12 order , this is carried out by the bfkl ( or lipatov ) equation@xcite which , in a physical gauge , effectively amounts to the summation of gluon ladder diagrams .",
    "two characteristic features of the result of this procedure are , first , the @xmath13 growth of the gluon distribution @xmath14 as @xmath1 decreases , with @xmath15 , and , second , the relaxation of the strong - ordering of the transverse momenta , @xmath16 , of the gluons along the ladder ( which is characteristic of the `` large '' @xmath1 , large @xmath17 `` altarelli - parisi '' regime )",
    ".    the recent measurements of @xmath9 at hera@xcite show a rise with decreasing @xmath1 which is entirely consistent with the @xmath13 bfkl perturbative qcd prediction@xcite .",
    "however the observed small @xmath1 behaviour of @xmath18 can also be mimicked by conventional dynamics based on the altarelli - parisi equation@xcite .",
    "because of the inclusive nature of @xmath18 , it is not a sensitive discriminator between bfkl and conventional dynamics . for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to look into properties of the final state . here",
    "we investigate whether or not the emitted transverse energy , @xmath0 , which accompanies a deep - inelastic event ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , can be used to identify the bfkl dynamics . due to the relaxation of the strong - ordering of the gluon @xmath16 s along the chain we expect to find more transverse energy in the central region ( between the current jet and the proton remnants ) than would result from conventional evolution .",
    "indeed a monte carlo study , in the context of heavy quark production , of the @xmath0 distribution as a function of rapidity hints at an increase of the @xmath0 flow if qcd all - loop \" dynamics @xcite ( which incorporates bfkl effects ) is employed , see fig .  9 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .    now the @xmath0 emitted by the gluon chain is given by the integral over the inclusive distribution for the emission of one gluon weighted by its @xmath0 .",

    "the expression in brackets in ( [ ac ] ) arises from the ( square of the ) bfkl vertex for real gluon emission , where @xmath37 and @xmath24 are the gluon transverse momenta in the photon - proton frame .",
    "we may use eqs ( [ aa])([ac ] ) , together with the solutions of the bfkl equations for @xmath33 and @xmath32 , to determine the @xmath0 flow , @xmath38 , which accompanies deep - inelastic scattering , provided @xmath39 .",

    "the cancellation ensures that , at small @xmath1 , we do not encounter the double logarithmic terms of the form @xmath98 .",

    "4 the sequence of dashed curves show the effect of choosing the ultraviolet cut - off in eq.([da ] ) to be @xmath212 gev@xmath206 , and the continuous curve is the result obtained if the cut - off is chosen to be @xmath213 as implied by energy - momentum conservation @xcite , where @xmath214 . at relatively low values of @xmath17 , such as @xmath209 gev@xmath206 , which are relevant to experiments at hera , energy conservation has a significant effect on the @xmath0 flow arising from bfkl gluon emission . fig .  5 compares the @xmath0 flow for @xmath209 gev@xmath206 with that for @xmath215 gev@xmath206 with , in each case , @xmath216 .",
    "also shown are the expectations from altarelli - parisi evolution .",
    "as anticipated we see a significant difference between the @xmath0 flow arising from bfkl and ap gluon emission , particularly at lower @xmath17 values .",
    "we may use eq .",
    "( [ bu ] ) to translate the @xmath0 flow as a function @xmath23 into a distribution in terms of the rapidity @xmath124 in the virtual - photon - proton c.m .   frame . for a reasonably flat @xmath0 distribution a good estimate of @xmath124",
    "is obtained if we insert the average value of @xmath104 into eq .",
    "( [ bu ] ) . for @xmath209",
    "gev@xmath206 we see that @xmath217 gev per unit of rapidity and so we take @xmath218 gev@xmath206 . the result for @xmath124",
    "is the scale shown above fig .",
    "if the @xmath0 distribution observed by the h1 collaboration @xcite is compared with monte carlo expectations , then reasonable agreement is found for @xmath219 , but for @xmath220 more @xmath0 appears to be present in the region between the current jet and the proton remnants than is implied by the favoured monte carlo calculations ( which at present do not allow for bfkl emissions ) .",
    "the deficiency is most evident in the rapidity region @xmath221 , which extends beyond the central region shown in fig .",
    "however it is encouraging that a simple extrapolation of the bfkl curves of fig .  5 into this region indicates a sizeable enhancement of the predicted @xmath0 distribution over that expected from conventional ap dynamics .",
    "our main objective is to find characteristics which are unique to bfkl dynamics at small @xmath1 .",
    "one striking feature of bfkl dynamics is the very strong @xmath13 , with @xmath222 , increase of the deep - inelastic structure function @xmath9 as @xmath1 decreases in the hera regime @xcite .",
    "however this increase can be mimicked by conventional altarelli - parisi evolution from a very low starting scale @xmath223 gev@xmath206 @xcite .",
    "global or inclusive quantities like structure functions do not provide conclusive tests of bfkl dynamics and it has been advocated that the bfkl effect can , in principle , be more definitively identified by studies of the final state in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "one possibility is mueller s proposal @xcite of measuring the @xmath34 dependence of deep - inelastic events containing a forward - going identified jet of longitudinal momentum @xmath224 .",
    "another , which we have studied here , is to measure the @xmath0 flow accompanying deep - inelastic events at small @xmath1 .",
    "a distinctive feature of bfkl dynamics is the diffusion pattern of the transverse momentum flow , in contrast to the strong - ordering of @xmath16 towards @xmath17 which is characteristic of conventional altarelli - parisi dynamics .",
    "indeed it is the absence of strong @xmath16-ordering which leads to a strongly enhanced @xmath0 distribution at small @xmath1 .",
    "we analysed this effect both analytically and numerically , focussing attention on the central region between the current jet and the proton remnants .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] we performed a detailed analytic analysis of the @xmath0 flow .",
    "we found that bfkl dynamics with fixed @xmath40 gives a broad gaussian @xmath0 distribution as a function of rapidity ( or rather @xmath47 ) which grows as @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath1 where @xmath2252log2 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the much smaller @xmath0 flow obtained assuming strong @xmath16-ordering , which gives an @xmath0 distribution that decreases with decreasing @xmath1 , for fixed @xmath17 . in section 4",
    "we confirmed these qualitative features using numerical solutions of the appropriate bfkl equations .",
    "as expected we found that the @xmath0 flow which accompanies deep - inelastic events is much larger for bfkl than for conventional ap dynamics .",
    "we also showed , at the low @xmath17 values relevant to hera , that energy conservation should be used to limit the energy - weighted integrations over transverse momentum .",
    "taking , for example , deep - inelastic events with @xmath211 and @xmath209 gev@xmath206 we found that the @xmath0 flow in the central rapidity region @xmath226 between the current jet and the proton remnants is about 2 gev per unit of rapidity .",
    "this result is very encouraging for the identification of bfkl dynamics .",
    "however for a quantitative comparison with experiment we will need to include contributions to the @xmath0 flow coming from the hadronization of the produced partons , not only from the bfkl ladder , but also from the partons radiated from the current jet . also there is a contribution radiated from the colour string which connects the current jet to the proton remnants .",
    "an analysis of this problem is under study and its results will be reported elsewhere .",
