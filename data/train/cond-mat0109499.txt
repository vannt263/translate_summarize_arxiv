    "the main effect resulting from the introduction of an external magnetic field @xmath15 in the ferromagnet is the displacement of the domain walls from the zero field equilibrium position . as the bulk energy of each domain",
    "is enhanced or reduced by the magnetic coupling of the magnetization with the magnetic field,@xmath190 depending on the orientation of the spins with respect to @xmath15 , the domain walls are dislocated in the direction that reduces the size of energetically unfavorable domains , enlarging the favorable ones and reestablishing the equilibrium . as shown by landau and lifshitz @xcite , the dynamical interaction of the magnetization with the magnetic field",
    "is driven by the zeeman effect , where the spins start to precess around @xmath15 as free moments , and by the relativistic interaction ( with coupling @xmath191 ) , following the equation of motion@xmath192,\\ ] ] where @xmath193 , with @xmath194 the electron charge , @xmath47 the electronic mass and @xmath81 the speed of light .",
    "the dot represents a time derivative .",
    "considering the case where @xmath15 is oriented along the easy magnetization direction , they found the domain walls speed of displacement to be@xmath195 employing the notation of sec . 2 for the saturated regime ( @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is constant in time , the velocity will be reduced to zero by the magnetic pressure of the bulk in a second moment , as the system approaches the equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "if we orient the external magnetic field transversely to the easy magnetization axis , the domain walls will remain in equilibrium with the magnetization of the bulk .",
    "the application of external magnetic fields on domain walls may have important applications in the fabrication of switches for bulk spin polarized electrons in mesoscopic systems .",
    "the scattering of an electron through a 180@xmath198 domain wall barrier comprehends two cases of technological interest for the fabrication of switches .",
    "consider for example one electron of spin up , aligned with the magnetization of the bulk , flowing in direction to a domain wall .",
    "if the time of flight of the electron through the wall is long enough , its spin will be adiabatically deflected and the scattered electron will be transmitted to the other side of the barrier with the spin flipped down , causing no additional cost of energy to the bulk . on the other hand ,",
    "if the time of flight is too short , ( considering that the electron is too fast or the barrier is too narrow ) the spin will not have time enough to be deflected by the spiral of magnetization and the electron ( in the classical picture ) will be reflected back from the barrier , in order to save energy from the bulk .",
    "as shown by cabrera and falicov @xcite _ _ , _ _ the domain walls may respond for a large change in the resistivity of metallic ferromagnets when the difference in the density of states between majority and minority spins at the fermi surface is also large .",
    "consider that we have two spherical fermi surfaces of different sizes , for example , one for spin up electrons and another for spin down ones .",
    "in the situation where the radius of one of the bulk fermi surfaces is very small ( minority spin ) and the other very large ( majority one ) , the majority spin electrons in one side of the barrier will find few channels to tunnel ballistically to the other side , where they would occupy the minority spin states . this way ,",
    "if the wall is sufficiently narrow in comparison to the electron mean free path , the electrons will most probably be backscattered by the barrier .",
    "the change in the bulk resistivity predicted , however , is not so large as to induce giant and colossal magnetoresistances .",
    "in contrast , the magnetoresistance can grow several orders of magnitude when the width of the walls becomes small in comparison to its size in bulk , as it has been observed experimentally in magnetic nanojunctions .",
    "a very interesting physics shows up in mesoscopic systems when a domain wall is geometrically constrained by a small constriction separating two ferromagnetic bulks of wider cross section .",
    "bruno @xcite derived the somehow remarkable result that when the constriction cross section is much smaller than the bulk one , the domain walls are practically independent on the specific characteristics of the material , including crystalline anisotropy and exchange stiffness , and depend only on the geometry of the constriction .",
    "the free energy of the system is in the form@xmath199=\\left[cm_{0}^{2}(\\theta^{\\prime})^{2}+u(\\theta)\\right]s(x)\\,,\\label{freeh2}\\ ] ] where @xmath200 defines the geometry of the constriction and @xmath49 is the crystalline anisotropy term .",
    "proceeding with the minimization , one finds through the usual euler - lagrange equation @xmath201 that@xmath202 bruno proposes that if the second term is much larger than the third and in addition if @xmath203 is integrable , meaning if @xmath204 is finite , then we may drop the crystalline contribution . defining the wall width according to the criterion@xmath205^{-1}=4\\left[\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\textrm{d}\\theta\\,\\theta^{\\prime}\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] he finds the simple results:@xmath206 and@xmath207^{2}}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\textrm{d}x\\ , s^{-2}(x)}\\,,\\ ] ] which are defined by the constriction only . in the most general case , where the crystalline term @xmath49 is present , he finds for different models of constriction that the domain wall is still driven by @xmath203 , and not by @xmath49 or the exchange stiffness @xmath81 .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied along the easy magnetization axis , the domain wall inside the constriction suffers a finite displacement proportional to the applied field , where the new position of equilibrium is achieved thanks to the magnetostatic pressure played by the constriction geometry @xcite .",
    "the localization of domain walls in nanojuctions are a theoretical possibility for the fabrication of fast switches demanded for _ spintronic _ devices .    in a wide sense ,",
    "the word spintronics means manipulation and control of the spin degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems , and to use this knowledge to make useful devices @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on spin transport properties in ferromagnetic metals . we have already discussed the magnetoresistance effect ( mr ) due to the domain structure and the scattering of electrons from bloch walls .",
    "the resistance of a ferromagnetic sample changes with the application of a small magnetic field .",
    "the field reorients the domains , and for a large enough value , it saturates the sample .",
    "the saturated configuration has a smaller resistance ( negative magnetoresistance ) than the one with domains , where the magnetization is not homogeneous ( for a @xmath208 wall , the magnetization of one domain is antiparallel to the magnetization of the adjacent domain)@xcite .",
    "this simple system suggests the invention of `` artificial '' devices where one could monitor the magnetic configuration through the application of small magnetic fields .",
    "based on the same physics , magnetic tunneling junctions ( mtj)@xcite and metallic multilayers ( mml ) structures@xcite were conceived , in order to operate as _ spin valves _ , due to the ` giant ' magnetoresistance ( gmr)effect displayed by those systems . in a typical mtj ,",
    "two ferromagnetic metallic electrodes are separated by a narrow nonmagnetic insulating layer . for mml ,",
    "two or more ferromagnetic layers are separated by nonmagnetic metallic spacers . in both structures",
    ", one can pin the magnetization of one of the electrodes using an additional magnetic layer which is strongly exchanged - biased with the ferromagnet@xcite .",
    "the other ferromagnetic electrode is left ` free ' to orient its magnetization with small applied fields .",
    "one can then change the resistance of the device by manipulating the relative orientation of the magnetization of both electrodes , phenomenon that has been named as spin - valve effect and is currently used in commercial applications for magnetic recording@xcite . for technological applications , ideal devices should have a gmr as large as possible , obtained at room temperature with small applied fields .",
    "experimental measurements of gmr in magnetic multilayers are usually performed for the current - in - plane ( cip ) geometry , where the electric current flows parallel to the layers . for this setup ,",
    "the resistance is fairly large and can be measured using standard techniques .",
    "the other possibility , much more complicated for experimental implementation , is to do the measurement with the current perpendicular to the layer plane , the so called cpp geometry ( cpp stands for current - perpendicular - to - the - plane ) . in this case , the resistance is very low and can only be measured using extremely sensitive techniques@xcite .",
    "domain walls are thought to play a relevant role in recent gmr experiments in magnetic nanocontacts .",
    "large values of mr , of the order of 300%-3000% at room temperature and for fields of about 100 oe , have been reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "the mr values found are attributed to strong electron scattering from narrow domain walls which are formed in the contact region . due to the constricted geometry and the rapid variation of the magnetization across the domain wall ,",
    "the electron spin can not follow adiabatically the local magnetization , as it is the case in bulk ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "we have developed an illustrative application of the landau mean field theory for phase transitions in ferromagnetic bodies .",
    "the advantage of this procedure resides in the phenomenological nature of the free energy parameters , allowing us to calculate equations of state without stating a specific microscopic model .",
    "the classical landau approach can then be extended to describe the formation of domains , with the corresponding change of the critical behavior , still within the mean field approximation . despite this theory",
    "is in fact very crude to describe the neighborhood of the critical point for systems whose specific heat diverges at the phase transition @xcite , the theory is also known for making remarkable qualitative predictions , with deep insights on the physics of critical phenomena , even in situations that extrapolate its region of validity@xcite . in particular",
    ", the theory provides its own criterion of failure and suggests new procedures to correctly describe the physics at the critical point , where fluctuations must be included@xcite .",
    "we have shown that the problem of domains in ferromagnets is driven by the presence of two different length scales competing in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "on one side , there is the bulk correlation length which drives the system to a classical mean field ferromagnetic behavior , and on the other , the length scale of the interfaces between domains .",
    "the competition between them produces two major effects : _",
    "i ) _ a new critical behavior , where the specific heat is strongly enhanced near @xmath12 from below in comparison to the bulk homogeneous limit , but is still small in comparison to the limit of surfaces , giving an intermediary critical exponent @xmath209 ; and _ ii ) _ a raise in the magnetoresistance in the ordered phase , specially for ferromagnets with a layered domain wall geometry . despite the study of magnetic domains is a rather old subject , it has recently opened a very promising field in technology .",
    "the transport properties of ferromagnetic domains suggest several interesting applications in spintronic devices , which we have briefly discussed .",
