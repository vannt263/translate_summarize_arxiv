    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the strong magnetic fields associated with this ubiquitous activity are thought to be central to a number of key physical processes in pms stars , including specifically the transfer of mass and of angular momentum from and to the circumstellar environment .",
    "x - ray activity observed in pms stars bears a striking resemblance to solar x - ray activity , albeit scaled up by several orders of magnitude in both energy and frequency of occurrence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , pms x - ray flares are well described by standard solar flare models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though in the case of some exceptionally long - lived flares it has been necessary to add self - eclipse of loop emission by the star ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , with the exception of a few very strongly accreting systems where the x - ray variability is at least in part accretion driven ( e.g. , v1647 ori ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , large - scale studies of simultaneous x - ray and optical variability in pms stars show that the x - ray variability is principally caused by coronal activity @xcite .",
    "young , solar - type stars appear , then , to have flaring magnetic field configurations that behave like , and can be interpreted as , scaled - up solar type flaring fields ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent overview ) .    during the early , active accretion phase of a pms star s evolution ( first few myr ; e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , the strong stellar field may be important in governing the interaction of the star with its protoplanetary disk .",
    "this magnetic star - disk interaction likely controls the funneling of circumstellar material from the disk onto the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is likely central to the launching of outflows including jets and winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore is likely a key mediator in the net flux of mass and angular momentum onto and away from the young star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even after the phase of active accretion subsides , scaled - up solar - type winds and elevated solar - type x - ray activity do not decline to present - day solar levels until approximately 1 gyr @xcite , potentially affecting the ongoing evolution of the star s angular momentum and the circumstellar environments of young planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "extremely large magnetic loops  extending out to tens of stellar radii from the stellar surface  have been inferred among the most powerful x - ray flaring pms stars from the _ chandra _ orion ultra - deep project ( coup ) sample ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying very large magnetic lever arms that are potentially able to shed significant angular momentum @xcite .",
    "while it was at first appealing to picture these large magnetic loops as being linked to circumstellar disks , perhaps either arising from a star - disk reconnection event @xcite or simply maintaining loop stability via anchoring to the disk , @xcite showed that the majority of these stars lack massive disks within reach of the loops . indeed ,",
    "earlier work by @xcite came to similar conclusions , inferring from the apparent absence of large magnetic loops among stars with close - in disks that perhaps it is the absence of the truncation by an inner dust disk which allows these loops to be so large in the first place .    on the sun ,",
    "the eruption of such magnetic structures can drive coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , which are observed in thomson - scattered optical light ( cf .",
    "while the faint scattered light of cmes can not yet be directly detected from most other stars , there have been recent observations of young stars with the fuse satellite @xcite and the detection of a large flare - associated mass ejection in the pms star z  cma @xcite .",
    "more generally , cmes are expected from low - mass stars by analogy to the sun as well as from basic escape velocity considerations for the flaring material ; indeed , cmes are believed to have been detected on m and k dwarfs from balmer line asymmetries , transient spectral line absorption components , and euv dimmings ( cf .",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the extreme x - ray flares observed on pms stars are expected to have associated extreme cmes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ramifications of which  for the evolution of the star , for the protoplanetary environment , and for the star s angular momentum evolution  depend on the resulting mass - loss rate and the evolution of that mass loss over the course of the star s pms evolution .",
    "a number of studies have used emission line tracers to empirically estimate the mass - loss rates from pms winds during the actively accreting , classical t  tauri star ( ctts ) phase ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "meanwhile , reliable empirical measures of mass - loss rates for non - accreting pms stars , particularly from impulsive cme - type events , are virtually nonexistent , and simulations of winds from non - accreting , weak - lined t  tauri stars ( wttss ) have only recently been investigated @xcite .    here",
    "we aim to make first empirical estimates of mass - loss rates for pms stars resulting from cmes , and then use these mass - loss rate estimates to infer the attendant angular momentum loss leading up to the main sequence . specifically ,",
    "we develop a method to estimate cme mass - loss rates from observed pms x - ray flares , calibrated to solar observations and models , and then calculate the resulting braking torques in the context of pms stellar evolutionary models .",
    "we begin by summarizing our previous work to establish an empirical relationship between x - ray flare flux and cme mass for the sun , and describe how we then extend that relationship to solar - type pms stars ( sec .",
    "[ sec_solarecap ] ) . in section [ sec_massloss ]",
    ", we use our empirical flare / cme relationship to derive cme mass - loss rates for pms stars both empirically ( using directly observed flare properties ) and analytically ( using functional representations of flare properties ) , and furthermore test our methodology on the sun , verifying that we are able to recover its well measured cme mass - loss rate from its observed x - ray flares .",
    "next , in section [ sec_angmom ] we calculate the attendant torque on pms stars exerted by the cmes , and assess the likelihood that these braking torques may serve to prevent the stars from spinning up as they contract toward the main sequence .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings in section [ sec_discus ] and summarize our conclusions in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "in @xcite , we cross - matched 10 years of solar flare and cme observations in order to determine , for associated flares and cmes , whether there are correlations between flare and cme properties . approximately 1000 solar flares and cmes were found to be spatially and temporally associated .",
    "the resulting relationship between flare flux and cme mass is well fit by a single power law of the form : @xmath9 ) } = 18.7 + 0.7 \\times { \\rm log(f } { \\rm~[w~m}^{-2}{\\rm ] ) } , \\ ] ] where m is the cme mass and f the flare flux .",
    "flare flux and cme mass hold this log - linear relationship over a few dex in flux and mass .",
    "solar flares are , by convention , classified by their peak x - ray flux , while for stellar x - ray flare observations , flare luminosities are reported .",
    "therefore , to relate our solar flare flux / cme mass relationship to observations of pms stellar flares , we convert the solar flare x - ray fluxes into energies , and re - frame the cme mass / flare flux relationship into a cme mass / flare energy relationship . to determine solar flare energy , we integrate the flux of the solar x - ray flare light curves from flare start to end time . for simplicity , we approximate the flares by their peak energy and assume a linear decay .",
    "specifically , each flare s total energy output equals one half of the observed peak flux , times the observed flare duration , times 4@xmath10(1au)@xmath11 .",
    "our final solar cme mass / flare energy relationship is shown in figure [ fig_massenergy ] , and it has the functional form : @xmath12 in this and all following cases , m will denote the cme mass and e the flare energy .",
    "k@xmath13 is ( 2.7@xmath141.2)@xmath1510@xmath16 in cgs units , and @xmath17 0.63@xmath140.04 . in adopting this relationship",
    ", we take advantage of the empirical correlation between associated flares and cmes , but we make no assumption or statement of a causal relationship between flares and cmes . indeed",
    ", it is well established that not every flare is associated with a cme , and not every cme is associated with a flare .",
    "@xcite found that 13% of cmes are flare associated and @xmath59% of flares are cme associated ; this lack of correspondence is at least partially driven by observational biases , and any correction for over or underestimating the number of cmes associated with flares is likely less than approximately a factor of two .",
    "the most energetic solar flares , however , are the most likely to be cme - associated , and these cmes are the most massive ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to name but a few studies on the matter ) .",
    "since young stars flares are very powerful with respect to solar flares and the most energetic solar flares have the highest rate of cme coincidence , we could suppose that a flare / cme association probability is close to unity for tts flares .",
    "since we can not yet directly observe cmes on young stars , we will use our solar - calibrated relationship ( eq .  [ eq_energymass ] ) as applied to x - ray flare observations of young stars to determine limits on the mass losses from young stars via solar - analog cmes .",
    "however , pms x - ray flare energies are 57 orders of magnitude stronger than solar flares , requiring a large extrapolation of the solar flare / cme relationship .",
    "therefore , it is prudent to demonstrate that the likely masses of cmes associated with the extreme x - ray flare energies observed on pms stars are in fact consistent with the solar flare / cme relationship . to do this , we have estimated the masses associated with the 32 most powerful pms x - ray flares observed in orion by coup @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , these masses represent the masses of post - flaring loops , which might not be equivalent to the cme masses , but in any case by analogy to the sun should be related to the cme masses .",
    "we use the flaring loop physical parameters for these 32 extreme pms flares as derived by @xcite , who used the solar - calibrated uniform cooling loop ( ucl ) model of @xcite to infer the flaring loop lengths and their densities , the latter inferred from the flare peak emission measures .",
    "we adopt the typically assumed cylindrical loop shape and the typically assumed loop aspect ratio(radius / length = 0.1 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , permitting the flaring loop volumes to be calculated .",
    "the loop masses then follow from the volumes and densities . in this way , we obtain flaring loop masses ranging from 10@xmath18  g to 10@xmath19  g for the @xcite sample .",
    "these 32 flaring loop masses and their associated flare energies are shown in figure [ fig_massenergy ] as the point with error bars at the far upper right , representing the mean and standard deviation of the sample .",
    "the large scatter of @xmath51 dex in the masses is likely due in part to the simplistic assumptions of the ucl model upon which the mass estimates are based .",
    "for example , the ucl model assumes that a single magnetic loop is involved in the observed x - ray flare , while on the sun , arcades of smaller loops are often involved in a given flaring  event . \"",
    "@xcite suggest that the height of such loop arcades can differ from the ucl inferred loop heights by factors of 210 , consistent with the scatter in loop masses we have estimated in figure [ fig_massenergy ] . in any case , the extreme pms cme masses so inferred are consistent to within a factor of 10 with that predicted by the solar - calibrated flare / cme relationship .",
    "note that we have not adjusted the fit from the solar data , but merely extrapolated it , which lends strong support to the use of this same solar - calibrated flare / cme relationship over the full range of solar to tts flare energies .",
    "having established the form of the relationship between flare energy and cme mass , in this section we derive total cme mass - loss rates for pms stars , both ( 1 ) empirically using the observed distribution of flare energies directly ( sections [ sec_solarempirical ] and [ sec_stellarempirical ] ) , and ( 2 ) analytically using the observed flares to describe a functional form for the distribution of flare energies ( sections [ sec_solaranalytical ] and [ sec_stellaranalytical ] ) .",
    "first , however , we apply our methodology to the solar case as a confirmation that our method recovers the observed cme mass - loss rate for the sun .",
    "we start by demonstrating our method for the solar case as a benchmark .",
    "for the sun , we have a measured cme mass distribution , from which we can directly calculate a cme mass loss rate to compare to the mass - loss rates that we infer from the x - ray flares .    in the lasco cme database @xcite ,",
    "13,862 cmes are reported from 1996 to 2006 , spanning almost a full solar activity period including minimum and maximum .",
    "of those , 6,733 cmes have well constrained mass measurements , and an additional 1,395 have masses flagged as highly uncertain .",
    "we show the full rate distribution of reported cme masses ( number of cmes per year as a function of cme mass ) , including both well - constrained and highly uncertain cme masses , in figure [ fig_solardists ] ( upper middle panel ) .",
    "we have included here the additional halo cmes ( those projected toward the earth , or which are so wide as to appear as if they were ) for which @xcite estimated masses .    summing up this entire distribution gives a cme mass loss rate of 7.8@xmath1510@xmath20 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "put another way , between 1996 and 2006 , the sun shed at least 1.563@xmath1510@xmath21 g yr@xmath4 via cmes .",
    "this value represents a lower limit to the mass loss rate via cmes from the sun , as just under half of the reported cmes have measured masses and there may be cmes that escape observation , especially at lower masses .",
    "@xcite found 1,153 of the cmes with measured masses to be associated with flares ( the masses of these cmes are also shown in figure [ fig_solardists ] , upper middle panel ) ; these cmes were used to derive the relationship between flare energy and cme mass ( eq .  [ eq_energymass ] ) .",
    "even though only @xmath515% of the cmes with measured masses are associated with flares , these flare - associated cmes constitute 40% of the total observed cme mass loss rate .",

    "this is reassuring that the cme mass - loss rate inferred directly from observed flares is able to reproduce the directly measured cme mass - loss rate . at the same time , as the right column of figure [ fig_solardists ] shows , our inferred mass distribution reflects a couple of known biases : first , we under - predict the highest mass cmes because our flare ",

    "there are several factors that modify the effective lever arm length in an eruptive outflow , compared to a steady one .",
    "the first is that the mass loss is not continuous , but happens in discrete bursts / ejections . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider that the mass loss occurs with an average rate of @xmath92 , but occuring via discrete bursts that happen for a fraction @xmath93 of the time ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "it is clear that a time - dependent wind is less efficient at extracting angular momentum than a steady wind with the same average mass loss rate . in the inferred distribution of cmes ( see fig .  [ fig_stellardists ] , middle panel ) , the mass loss is dominated by the lowest energy events , of which there are @xmath96 per year . to estimate @xmath93 , we also need to specify the duration of each event  i.e . , the duration over which we can think of the cme as a steady wind from the surface of the star . as an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", we consider the time for a cme traveling several hundred km / s to cross several stellar radii , which is of the order of one hour . for 10 events per year with a duration of one hour , @xmath97 . to calculate our upper limit to @xmath91 in section [ sec_stellaranalytical ]",
    ", we considered that the flare rate distribution extends to much lower energies than observed . in this case , the event frequencies of the lowest energy flares are much higher , implying a larger value for @xmath93 .",
    "the second factor modifying the effective lever arm length in an eruptive flow is that the cme events are not globally distributed in the corona , but take place over a fraction of the total solid angle of whole sky .",
    "more importantly for the angular momentum flow , not all of the stellar magnetic flux participates in the azimuthal acceleration of the outflow . to take this into account",
    ", the factor @xmath90 in equation [ eq_ra1 ] should include a factor of @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the fraction of ( unsigned ) magnetic flux participating in the cme flow , compared to the total stellar surface magnetic flux associated with the global / dipole field .",
    "the unsigned flux participating in a cme should approximately equal the geometric area times the field strength of the underlying active region .",
    "generally speaking , and almost by definition , the magnetic field strengths of active regions are much stronger than the global field strength , while the areas are much smaller than the total stellar surface area .",
    "the product of these two approximates @xmath99 , and it is not clear in general whether this will be very different from unity . for the purpose of this section , we assume @xmath1001.0",
    ".    other factors that influence the effective lever arm length is the angle that the direction of the cme flow makes with respect to the rotation axis of the star and that the acceleration of the cmes may be significantly different than the acceleration of the steady wind in the simulations of matt et al . given the much larger uncertainties discussed above , we neglect these effects for the present analysis and approximate @xmath101 .",

    ", we use a model for the evolution of a 1 @xmath104 star from @xcite , which gives the stellar radius @xmath88 ( and thus surface escape speed @xmath89 ) as a function of stellar age .",
    "the upper left panel of figure [ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] shows the evolution of @xmath88 . to compute the lever arm length",
    ", we must specify the surface magnetic field strength , mass loss rate , and @xmath90 . for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt a singular value of @xmath105 g ( corresponding to the equatorial field strength of the dipole field measured on bp tau ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and assume that it is constant in time .",
    "the range of possible values of @xmath87 for ttss , as well as how this may evolve in time , is not well constrained observationally , which introduces an uncertainty in our calculated values .",
    "the upper right panel of figure [ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] shows the alfvn radius as a function of time , for four combinations of the extreme values of mass loss rate and @xmath90 discussed above . in the figure ,",
    "the vertical dash - triple - dotted lines mark the approximate age range of ttss ( for which this calculation is valid ) , corresponding roughly to an age of a few myr , plus or minus a few myr .",
    "since the mass loss rates we are considering correspond to ttss , the calculation is only valid / relevant between these two vertical lines , but we show a wider range of ages for context / illustrative purposes .",
    "it is clear that the range of @xmath90 and @xmath91 considered corresponds to a range of a factor of about 13 in the possible alfvn radii at any given age . in the age range of ttss , the alfvn radius could be in the range of 370 @xmath88 , depending on the wind parameters .",
    "observationally , the largest magnetic structures are seen to exist at distance scales comparable to alfvn radii calculated here : the magnetic loops of @xcite were inferred to be from 0.155 @xmath88 in extent ( assuming these were indeed single loops ) , and cool prominences have been seen to extend up to a few stellar radii from tts @xcite . at later evolutionary stages , solar type stars",
    "are still seen to have extended , suspended material : the 50 myr old @xcite solar analog ab dor was observed to have cool , corotating clouds at distances from @xmath59 - 20 r@xmath106 from the rotation axis , and were estimated to have masses @xmath10710@xmath21 g @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed prominences on speedy mic , a 30 myr old k3 dwarf , and estimated masses to be @xmath52@xmath1510@xmath108 g . in stellar outflows , the alfvn radii are typically comparable to or slightly larger than the size of the largest closed magnetic loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the measured sizes of post - flare loops and prominences may represent an approximate lower limit on the alfvn radii for these systems .",
    "the spin rate of stars will change in response to external torques and changes in the structure of the star ( and subsequent change in the stellar moment of inertia ) .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum for an isolated star rotating as a solid body can be expressed as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the moment of inertia of the star , @xmath84 is the angular spin rate of the star , @xmath111 is the wind torque ( eq .  [ eq_tauw ] ) ; here , we re treating the cme outflow like a wind , so @xmath112 ) , and @xmath113 is the normalized radius of gyration ( defined by the radial mass distribution ) . for a star in a tight binary system or a star that is still actively accreting from a disk",
    ", there will be additional torque terms in equation [ eq_pseudo ] , which we neglect here in order to isolate the effects of cmes alone .",
    "to compute the relative strength of the terms in this equation , we use the 1 @xmath104 @xcite model to specify the evolution of @xmath113 and @xmath88 . in this and in most other pms stellar evolution models , the star is fully or nearly fully convective during the first @xmath510 myr of evolution . in convective regions , the mixing of material redistributes angular momentum on a timescale that is much shorter than evolutionary timescales .",
    "thus , external torques effectively act upon the entire mass of the convection zone ; for a fully convective pms star , the external torques act on the entire star ( as opposed to acting only on a thin shell that is rotationally decoupled from the interior ) .",
    "there have been observations of possible differential rotation in a few ttss , with amplitudes of @xmath96% of the bulk / average rotation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but in the vast majority of ttss studied no measureable differential rotation is observed .",
    "thus here we follow convention and treat the star as a solid - body rotator , where @xmath84 represents the bulk rotation rate , and the error associated with this approximation is much smaller than for other unknowns ( such as the value of @xmath90 ) . in order to specify @xmath84",
    ", we simply assume that the star is always rotating at a fraction of @xmath114% of breakup speed , in order to approximately represent the `` slow rotators '' in observed tts spin distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the rotation period is assumed to be @xmath115 since both terms on the right hand side of equation [ eq_pseudo ] are proportional to @xmath84 , the relative value of these two terms is independent on the assumed value of @xmath84 .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure [ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] compares the two terms on the right hand side of equation [ eq_pseudo ] as a function of time .",
    "the broken lines show the value of @xmath116 , where we have multiplied by @xmath117 in order to compare the absolute value of the terms on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the different line styles and colors correspond to the assumptions and range of possible values of stellar wind parameters discussed in the previous section and labeled in the top right panel of the figure .",
    "the stellar wind torque always acts to spin down the star ( decrease @xmath84 ) .",
    "the solid line in the bottom left panel shows the last term on the right - hand side of equation [ eq_pseudo ] .",
    "this term has the dimensions of torque and can be thought of as a pseudo torque , which describes how the spin rate of the star changes due to changes in the moment of inertia ( i.e. , even if total angular momentum were conserved ) , and which acts to spin up the star ( increase @xmath84 ) .    in order to assess how the terms in equation [ eq_pseudo ] may affect the stellar spin rate , it is useful to compute a spin - up or spin - down timescale by dividing the total angular momentum by the torque . by rearranging equation [ eq_pseudo ] ,",
    "the spin - up / down time can be written @xmath118 when the cme - outflow torque dominates , the star will spin down on a timescale @xmath119 by contrast , when the changes in stellar structure dominate , the star will spin up on a timescale @xmath120 one advantage of looking at things in this way is that it is independent of the current spin rate of the star . in the bottom right panel of figure",
    "[ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] , we show @xmath121 ( solid line ) and @xmath122 ( broken lines , corresponding to the various wind parameters indicated in the upper right panel ) , as a function of stellar age , for the 1 @xmath104 siess et al .  model . at",
    "any given time , the shortest timescale is the dominant one , and if it is comparable to or shorter than the age of the star ( shown as a dotted line ) , it will have a noticible effect on the stellar spin rate .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] that the stellar contraction is expected to effectively spin the star up during the first 30 myr ( in the absence of any external torques ) .",
    "the figure shows that this pseudo - torque from stellar contraction completely dominates over the angular momentum loss associated with cmes , for most of the range of parameters considered here .",
    "the only exception is that , for the highest mass outflow rates allowable by our analysis , and for @xmath123 , the angular momentum loss by cmes becomes comparable to the contraction pseudo - torque at an age of a few million years and dominates it thereafter .",
    "many of the stars in the coup sample are actively accreting from a surrounding accretion disk .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the angular momentum exchange between the star and disk , arising from this interaction .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the spin - down torque associated with the magnetic connection between the star and disk will be less than the torque from a stellar outflow , in the case where the alfvn radius is not too large and when the magnetic coupling to the disk is strong .",
    "using their `` preferred '' values for the coupling , they demonstrated that a stellar outflow will carry away more angular momentum than the star - disk interaction , as long as @xmath124 .",
    "as demonstrated in the upper right panel of figure [ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] , @xmath125 for all of the outflow parameters considered here , so the spin - down torque due to a star - disk magnetic connection should be negligible .",
    "it could be modified to consider @xmath126 , but the overall results are not affected . ] .",
    "accreting stars can also experience strong spin - up torques , mainly associated with the accretion of high specific angular momentum from nearly - keplerian disks .",
    "the spin - up torque from accretion is given by @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the accretion rate , and @xmath129 is the radial location of the inner truncation of disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an example , for the star considered here , accreting at a rate of @xmath130yr@xmath4 , with a truncation radius of a few stellar radii , and at an age of @xmath131 years ( values appropriate for the early tts phase ) , the resulting accretion torque is @xmath132 erg .",
    "this spin - up toruqe is comparable to the contraction pseudo - torque at the same age ( lower left panel of figure [ fig_cmetorque_m1.0 ] ) .",
    "thus , depending on the stellar age , accretion rate , etc . , the processes acting to spin up the star may be dominated by either contraction or accretion . in order to counteract this spin - up torque and to explain the observations of slow rotators at all tts ages",
    ", the mass outflow rates must be high , the magnetic field strengths must be large , and/or additional spin - down torques ( that are not considered here ) must be present . the cme outflows inferred in the present work could be important near the end of the tts phase , in the case of weakly- or non - accreting stars , and if the mass loss rate is near our upper limit ( @xmath133 yr@xmath4 ) and @xmath123 .",
    "in this work , we derive mass - loss rates for cmes from solar type pms stars .",
    "this is a first attempt to estimate pms mass - loss via this mechanism and to calibrate it explicitly against the sun and against observations of flaring magnetic loops on pms stars .",
    "we find the total cme mass - loss rate to be in the range of @xmath1 to @xmath2 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is relatively modest by comparison with mass loss rates observed for tts winds .",
    "however , the magnetic lever arms associated with the largest pms cmes , as inferred from the coup sample stars and scaled from the sun , are large  up to tens of stellar radii  so the resulting torques can be significant . assuming the cme mass loss rate for a typical @xmath51  m@xmath3  tts is @xmath134 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , the associated spin - down torque is likely too small to counteract the spin - up effects of contraction and accretion in the t tauri phase",
    ". however , the spin - down torque from cmes could be important after an age of a few myr if the mass loss rate is @xmath135 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , the accretion rate is low , and the angular momentum loss is efficient .",
    "our estimates of the angular momentum loss efficiency ( i.e. , the magnetic lever arm radii ; see section [ sec_angmom ] ) are based upon axisymmetric , steady - state wind calculations , and 3-dimensional simulations are needed to improve these estimates .    our stellar cme model is derived from relating solar activity to stellar ; in one sense , we immediately underestimate mass losses via cmes by only selecting solar cmes that occurred with flares .",
    "we find , however , that much of the mass loss comes from the cmes associated with flares .",
    "the most massive cmes are associated with the most powerful flares , and the most energetic flares are the most often associated with cmes @xcite .",
    "thus , using stellar flare activity to determine a stellar cme rate likely represents a lower bound on the stellar cme activity .",
    "one of the most pivotal parts of this calculation is the extrapolation of the cme mass / flare energy relationship",
    ". the adopted direct extrapolation , while crossing many orders of magnitude , is indeed physically motivated , and introduces the fewest new assumptions .",
    "we are able to , using the coup `` superflare '' observations , justify the extrapolation up to tts flare energies ; our premise is that these loops represent proxies for stellar cme masses as the loops exist within the density and height regimes from which cmes are generally launched on the sun .",
    "the consistency with the solar cme mass / flare energy relationship is particularly compelling given that it spans six dex in flare energy .    in adopting the stellar x - ray flare frequency relationship of @xcite ,",
    "we have generated an `` ensemble mass loss rate '' ; in doing this , we have neglegted to separate out any mass - dependent characteristics of the distribution .",
    "there would be , however , significant differences in the flare activity for stars of the same mass with different rotation rates . given the mixed sample of classical and weak - line tts in the coup ,",
    "there are also self - absorption effects ( by the accretion columns , * ? ? ?",
    "* or a circumstellar disk inclined to our line of sight ) which could introduce bias into a flare frequency distribution .",
    "it was our intent in using the coup sample to diminish all of these observational effects via the large number of stars observed in various activity and evolutionary phases , as well as inclinations and rotation rates .",
    "future work could include analyzing subsets of the coup dataset to see whether there is an x - ray luminosity dependence on the flare rate ( and thus , a difference in cme mass loss rates as well ) .",
    "as noted in section [ sec_stellaranalytical ] , one particular difficulty with this analysis was the sensitivity of our analytical solutions to the value of the power law slope . within the errors on these quantities",
    ", we find our mass loss rates derived analytically could span two orders of magnitude . the empirically derived mass loss rates , while derived from incomplete samples , represent robust lower limits .",
    "in the solar case , our analytical mass loss rate did predict more mass loss than was observed in the lasco database , but as discussed in section [ sec_solarecap ] , the lasco database itself is missing many cme masses , so the total mass loss rate is undoubtedly higher . despite this apparent overprediction",
    ", we still derive a mass loss rate below the steady solar wind mass loss rate , which is as anticipated .    observing stellar cmes",
    "would be ideal for addressing the most uncertain parameters in this work , but presently , understanding the observational signatures and being able to detect a stellar cme remain outstanding problems .",
    "efforts have been made with euv spectroscopy ; @xcite point out a lack of simultaneous solar spectra during flare / cme events , creating great difficulty for the interpretation of stellar data .",
    "additionally , managing to catch a stellar cme with the right set of parameters for observation ( e.g. , density and projection ) requires sufficient observing time to increase the probability of detection . for a steady , hot ( 1 mk ) , coronal wind , @xcite calculate a mass loss rate of 1@xmath1510@xmath72 m@xmath3",
    "yr@xmath4 would produce strong euv and x - ray emission , much higher than is observed .",
    "our highest mass loss rate estimate , @xmath510@xmath72 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , is probably unlikely given the strong observational signature that would attend such a mass loss rate .",
    "interestingly , however , the authors also found that decreasing the mass loss rate by a factor of 10 decreased the excess emission by a factor of 100 .",
    "given the `` bursty '' nature of our cmes , and the likely high cadence of these bursts , and potentially cooler temperatures ( solar cmes are observed to rapidly expand as they travel away from the sun ) , a significant level of mass loss could easily escape detection .",
    "the coup `` superflaring '' targets were generally weak lined tts @xcite ; it is likely that accretors could show an enhanced activity rate and thus more frequent cmes , as well as accretion - driven winds @xcite which could further deplete angular momentum .",
    "the presence of a close - in disk in accreting systems might mitigate the enhanced cme rate with reduced lever arm lengths , however modeling work @xcite has shown star - disk flaring can disrupt circumstellar disk material , causing an mri instability that then generates an accretion flow . thus , in a cyclical fashion , large scale flaring can lead to accretion , the accretion then powering winds , outflows , and more reconnection , resulting in further mass / angular momentum loss .",
    "@xcite illustrate one mechanism by which accretion could power a wind : infalling material impacting the stellar surface would generate alfvn waves , the propagation of which could trigger reconnection , accretion thus powering activity .",
    "this represents a preliminary effort at calculating mass and angular momentum losses for t tauri stars via scaled - up , solar - analog coronal mass ejections .",
    "our calculations are based on well - observed flares among a large sample of solar - type pre - main - sequence stars , and our analysis methods have been tested for the most well - understood case , the sun . beginning with an established relationship between solar flare energies and cme masses @xcite , we use the observed flare frequency distribution to infer a cme mass distribution .",
    "we are able to infer empirically and analytically solar cme mass loss rates that are consistent with observations , and also consistent with expectations for a mass loss rate once observational biases are carefully accounted for .",
    "our lower limit on the mass shed via cmes in a generic tts case is 6.2@xmath1510@xmath53 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 . to obtain an upper limit on the stellar cme mass loss rate ,",
    "we calculate analytic solutions to account for observational biases ( most importantly , the stellar x - ray flare detection limit ) ; our upper limit to the mass loss rate via cmes is @xmath136 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 .",
    "finally , we assess the resulting torque against the star s rotation provided by the cme mass loss .",
    "we find that within the ranges of mass loss rates and effective lever arm lengths ( reflecting the difference in steady versus `` bursty '' mass loss ) being considered , the resulting alfvn radii would span a large range , 370 r@xmath106 , consistent with previous inferences of the physical sizes of large - scale magnetic structures .",
    "we find that near our upper limit mass loss case ( @xmath10710@xmath71 m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 ) , this mechanism could be effective for slowing stellar rotation on a timescale comparable to tts lifetimes ."
