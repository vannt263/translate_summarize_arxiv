    "since the invention of neutrino beams at accelerators and the consequent discovery of the two flavors of neutrinos@xcite , the reactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are the dominant reactions of muon and electron neutrinos with energies from @xmath5  mev to @xmath6  gev , have played an important role in studies of neutrino flavor .",
    "these charged - current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) interactions are important not only because they identify the flavor of the neutrino through the production of the lepton in the final state , but also because the two body kinematics permit a measurement of the neutrino energy from only the observation of the final state lepton .",
    "accelerator neutrino experiments like t2k@xcite , nova@xcite and a number of proposed experiments seek to make precision measurements of the neutrino flavor oscillations @xmath0 or @xmath7 in order to determine the mass hierarchy of neutrinos and to search for cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "uncertainties on differences between these cross - sections for muon and electron neutrinos will contribute to experimental uncertainties in these flavor oscillation measurements .",
    "interactions of the charged - current with fundamental fermions , such as @xmath8 , have no uncertainties in the differences between the reactions for muon and electron neutrino interactions because the weak interaction is experimentally observed to be flavor universal . in particular , the effect of the final state lepton mass in this two body reaction of fundamental fermions can be unambiguously calculated .",
    "one such calculable difference occurs because of radiative corrections to the tree - level ccqe process .",
    "radiative corrections from a particle of mass @xmath9 in a process with momentum transfer @xmath10 are of order @xmath11 , which implies a significant difference due to the mass of the final state lepton@xcite .",
    "although this effect is calculable , it is not accounted for in neutrino interaction generators used in recent analysis of experimental data , such as genie@xcite , neut@xcite and nuance@xcite .",
    "there are , however , cross - section differences due to lepton mass which can not be calculated from first principles with current theoretical tools .",
    "the presence of the target quarks inside a strongly bound nucleon lead to a series of _ a priori _ unknown form factors in the nucleon level description of the reaction , e.g. , @xmath1 .",
    "it is the uncertainties on these form factors combined with the alteration of the kinematics due to lepton mass that leads to uncertainties , and that is the focus of the results of this paper .",
    "there is also a modification of the reaction cross - sections due to the effects of the nucleus in which the target nucleons are bound . the model incorporated in genie@xcite ,",
    "neut@xcite and nuance@xcite is a relativistic fermi gas model@xcite which provides a distribution of nucleon kinematics inside the nucleus .",
    "a more sophisticated description from a nuclear spectral function model@xcite is implemented in the nuwro generator@xcite .",
    "we do not consider the effect of the nucleus in this work , although it may be important in the relative weighting of nucleon kinematics at low energy .",
    "however , this work provides a blueprint for studying the effect of the final state lepton mass in different nuclear models .",
    "the cross section for quasi - elastic scattering of neutrinos at energies relevant for oscillation experiments may be calculated from the fermi theory of weak interactions with the effective lagrangian , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi constant and the @xmath14 are the leptonic and hadronic currents .",
    "the form of the leptonic current is specified by the theory to be @xmath15 because the leptons are fundamental fermions . however , as mentioned above the hadronic current for quasi - elastic scattering depends on unknown form factors of the nucleons .",
    "the hadronic current can be decomposed into vector and axial components , @xmath16 @xmath17 contains three terms related to the vector form factors @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 contains three terms related to the axial form factors @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath34 the vector form factors do not follow the dipole structure@xcite .",
    "the neutrino scattering data contains conflicting results among different experiments@xcite which limit our ability to effectively use that information to constrain the axial form factor .",

    "the form factor @xmath37 is determined from pcac which , under minimal assumptions , states that@xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the renormalized field operator that creates the @xmath46 and @xmath42 is a constant which may be computed at @xmath38 .",
    "pcac gives the following relation between @xmath37 and the pion nucleon form factor , @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the pion mass .",
    "the goldberger - treiman relation@xcite predicts @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pion decay constant . under the assumption that the goldberger - treiman relation holds for all values of @xmath34 , then @xmath37 is @xmath52 this is the relationship that is used in all modern neutrino generators@xcite .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath23 are form factors associated with the second class current ( scc ) .",
    "the existence of such currents requires charge or time symmetry violation , and current measurements show the size of these violations to be small .",
    "additionally a nonzero @xmath20 term would violate conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) .",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be limited experimentally in studies of beta decay .",
    "almost all current analyses of neutrino data assume that the sccs are zero .",
    "the vector sccs only enter the cross - section in terms suppressed by @xmath55 , but there are unsuppressed terms involving the axial scc form factor .",
    "in this section , we will study the dependence of the muon - electron cross - section differences as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath34 .",
    "differences arise due to the variation of kinematic limits due to the final state lepton mass , different radiative corrections to the tree level process and uncertainties in nucleon form factors .",
    "equations  [ eq : afunc ] and [ eq : bfunc ] contain explicitly the dependence of the ccqe cross - section in terms of the form factors .",
    "lepton mass , @xmath9 , enters in both @xmath57 and @xmath58 and these terms involve all the form factors discussed above . note that @xmath37 and @xmath20 _ only _ appear in terms multiplied by @xmath55 and therefore are negligible in the electron neutrino cross - section , but not in the muon neutrino cross - section .    as metrics ,",
    "we define the fractional differences between the muon and electron neutrino ccqe cross - sections : @xmath59 the integrals over @xmath34 in eqs .",
    "[ eq : diff ] and [ eq : intdiff ] are taken within the kinematic limits of each process , and those limits depend on lepton mass as discussed in the next section .",
    "another useful metric is the difference between a cross - section in a model with a varied assumption from that of a reference model .",
    "our reference model derives @xmath60 and @xmath61 from the electric and magnetic vector sachs form factors which follow the dipole form of eq .",
    "[ eq : dipole ] with @xmath62  ( gev / c)@xmath40 , and it assumes @xmath22 is a dipole with @xmath63  ( gev / c)@xmath40 .",
    "the reference model uses the derived @xmath37 from eq .",
    "[ eqn : fp ] , and assumes that @xmath64 at all @xmath34 .",
    "we then define : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the reference model for @xmath67 or its anti - neutrino analogue and @xmath68 is the model to be compared to the reference .",
    "large differences between the electron and muon neutrino quasi - elastic cross - sections exist at low neutrino energies from the presence of different kinematic limits due to the final state lepton mass and due to the presence of the pseudoscalar form factor , @xmath37 , derived from pcac and the goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "these differences are typically accounted for in modern neutrino interaction generators .",
    "there are also significant differences due to radiative corrections , particularly in diagrams that involve photon radiation attached to the outgoing lepton leg which are proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "these differences are calculable , but are typically not included in neutrino interaction generators employed by neutrino oscillation experiments . if our estimate of these differences , of order @xmath70 , is confirmed by more complete analyses , then this is a correction that needs to be included as it is comparable to the size of current systematic uncertainties at accelerator experiments@xcite .",
    "modifications of the assumed @xmath37 from pcac and the goldberger - treiman relation and the effect of the form factors @xmath20 and @xmath23 corresponding to second class vector and axial currents , respectively , are not included in neutrino interaction generators .",
    "a summary of the possible size of these effects , as we have estimated them , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "these differences , particularly from the second class vector currents , may be significant for current@xcite and future@xcite neutrino oscillation experiments which seek precision measurements of @xmath71 and its anti - neutrino counterpart at low neutrino energies .",
    "previous work@xcite has demonstrated sensitivity to these second class currents in neutrino and anti - neutrino quasi - elastic muon neutrino scattering , and future work with more recent data@xcite and newly analyzed data@xcite may help to further limit uncertainties on possible second class currents .",
