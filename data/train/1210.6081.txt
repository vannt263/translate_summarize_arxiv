    "one of the simplest theoretical approaches to the problem , so called self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , was developed in refs .   for 2d electrons with quadratic spectrum mostly for the case of the short - range disorder .",

    "this implies that the relevant energy scale ( the maximum of the chemical potential @xmath6 and temperature @xmath7 ) is large compared to the inverse transport scattering time @xmath8 which coincides with the quantum scattering time @xmath9 for the short - range disorder .",

    "@xcite    magnetotransport in graphene was studied theoretically in refs .  .",
    "in refs .   a general expression for the scba conductivity tensor of graphene with short - range disorder was derived and analyzed in detail for the case of well separated lls .",
    "other types of disorder were also discussed , @xcite including disorder potentials having special types of symmetries .",
    "@xcite in the collision - dominated regime ( when the rate of inelastic collisions due to the electron - electron interaction exceeds the impurity - induced scattering rate ) , the mr of graphene at the dirac point was calculated in ref .   within the boltzmann - equation framework by using the relativistic hydrodynamic approach . in ref",
