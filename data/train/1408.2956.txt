    "higher - dimensional spacetimes are investigated extensively in the context of unified theories .",
    "spacetimes of the kaluza - klein type , non - compact three - dimensional space with compact extra dimensions of small size , would accord with effective four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "black holes with compact extra dimensions , so - called kaluza - klein black holes , could be suitable for the model describing black holes that reside in our four - dimensional world .",
    "for example , five - dimensional squashed kaluza - klein black hole solutions @xcite behave as fully five - dimensional black holes near the horizon and asymptote to the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime with a compact extra dimension .",
    "the squashed black holes are constructed on the gross - perry - sorkin ( gps ) monopole solution @xcite , and they have smooth horizons .",
    "one of the important questions for the kaluza - klein spacetime model is why the size of extra dimensions are too small to detect by experiments .",
    "an interesting explanation is that the three - dimensional space expands while the extra dimensions shrink enough in the history of the universe @xcite . in the five - dimensional case ,",
    "the ( 4 + 1)-dimensional kasner solution , three - dimensional space expands while an extra dimension shrinks with the time evolution , provides such a model universe .",
    "gibbons , lu and pope generalized the gps monopole solution to dynamical ones @xcite , which nicely behaves as the kasner universe in a distant region .    as generalizations of the kastor - traschen solution that describes charged black holes in de sitter universe @xcite",
    ", there exist a lot of solutions on higher - dimensional black holes for the einstein - maxwell system @xcite , and brane solutions @xcite in expanding universe models .",
    "all of these solutions are constructed using harmonic functions on four - dimensional ricci flat spaces , where the harmonic functions contain the time - coordinate as a parameter .",
    "time evolution of these spacetimes are driven by a cosmological constant , and then , all spatial dimensions expand in the laps of time .    in this paper , we investigate black hole solutions on the dynamical gps monopole solution derived by gibbons , lu and pope @xcite . since a time slice of the dynamical gps monopole solution is a ricci flat space which has the time - variable as a parameter , by using suitable harmonic functions on the space we can construct an exact time - dependent solution in the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "the solution approaches to the dynamical gps monopole solution in the far region , expanding three dimensions and shrinking a compact dimension , then it describes a charged black hole in a kaluza - klein universe .",
    "what happens to the black hole when the extra dimension shrinks so that its size becomes smaller than the size of the black hole ? to answer this question , we study geometrical properties of the solution .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the explicit form of the solution in sec.[bhsols ] .",
    "the curvature singularities are studied in sec.[singularities ] .",
    "we give a c@xmath0 extension of the metric , and show that the solution describes a black hole in sec.[eventhorizon ] .",
    "geometrical properties of the event horizon are also discussed .",
    "we summarize our results in sec.[summary ] .",
    "we consider exact charged dynamical solutions in the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with the action @xmath1 the metric and the maxwell field of the solutions are written as @xmath2 ,   \\label{eq : metric } \\\\   a_\\mu dx^\\mu & = &   \\pm \\frac { \\sqrt{3 } } { 2 } h^{-1 } dt ,   \\label{eq : field}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the metric of unit two - dimensional sphere , s@xmath4 , and the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive constants .",

    "it is clear that the metric has a null infinity at @xmath21 in the kasner - like region . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath22 with @xmath18 , the metric approaches @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{eq : ads}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it will be clarified , the metric in the form of ads@xmath24s@xmath25 does not describe near horizon geometry .",
    "the black hole solution is constructed on the dynamical gps solution .",
    "if we take a kaluza - klein reduction of the metric with respect to the killing vector field @xmath26 , the obtained four - dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton solution coincides with that in @xcite .",
    "to examine the global structure of the spacetime with the metric , we first seek the locations of curvature singularities .",
    "the kretschmann invariant and the square of the maxwell field are @xmath27 we see that there are curvature singularities at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these two singularities intersect at @xmath30 ( see fig.[tokuitenzu ] ) .    for the spacetime signature @xmath31 , the inequality @xmath32 should be hold .",
    "namely , we can consider three regions : ( i ) @xmath33 , @xmath34 , ( ii ) @xmath35 , @xmath34 , and ( iii ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 . since the metric in the region iii describes a spacetime with a naked singularity",

    "the metric describes a spacetime with the signature @xmath31 in three regions : i ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , ii ( @xmath35 , @xmath34 ) , and iii ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) . , width=415 ]    we consider the normal vector field @xmath39 to the @xmath40 surfaces .",

    "the metric has an apparent singularity at @xmath14 . we investigate the possibility of extension by using null geodesics starting from the region @xmath33 .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the null geodesics confined in the @xmath20-@xmath38 plane , i.e. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , the null geodesics are determined by the null condition , @xmath52 then , we have @xmath53 for ingoing future null geodesics , increasing @xmath20 and decreasing @xmath38 , we see that @xmath20 should diverge as @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the null geodesics terminate the coordinate boundary @xmath54 with @xmath55 . then",
    ", we try to extend the metric there .    in many cases ,",
    "a set of null geodesics is a powerful tool to construct coordinates covering the black hole horizons .",
    "unfortunately , in our case , we hardly solve in analytic form .",
    "then , we use curves that are approximate solutions for in the vicinity of @xmath56 . we assume the approximate solutions in the form , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are constants , and @xmath59 is an arbitrary parameter . substituting into , and taking the limit @xmath54 , we can determine the constants @xmath58 as @xmath60 the constant @xmath61 takes a value in the range @xmath62 .",

    "the metric , which represents ads@xmath73(squashed s@xmath74 ) , and the maxwell field are regular at @xmath75 .",
    "we also see that the @xmath75 surface is a null surface , and the angular part of the metric , which describes a squashed s@xmath74 , does not depend on the time at @xmath75 .",
    "it means that expansion of outgoing null bundle emanating from the squashed s@xmath74 on a time slice @xmath76 is vanishing at @xmath77 .",

    "then it is clear that the spacetime with the metric with gives a c@xmath0 extension of the metric in the region i to the region ii .",

    "we have extended the metric across the surface @xmath14 and @xmath113 to clarify the spacetime is black hole . although the coordinate boundaries @xmath114 and @xmath115 in the region i , and @xmath116 and @xmath98 in the region ii would be extendible , explicit extension is not done yet .",
    "the spacetime is dynamical because the metric does not admit any timelike killing vector .",

    "@xcite . taking the limit that the asymptotic size of the extra dimension becomes zero ,",
    "the charged squashed kaluza - klein metric reduces to .",
    "it is clear that the event horizon is static .    at the late stage ,",
    "the three - dimensional distances between observers at @xmath124 and constant angular coordinates increase by the cosmological scale factor @xmath125 , and the size of the extra dimension shrinks as @xmath126 .",
    "nevertheless , near black hole region , i.e. , @xmath127 with @xmath44 , for an observer at a finite circumference distance @xmath128 the size of extra dimension is the finite time - independent value @xmath129 .",
    "it is also clear from that the horizon is non - degenerate though the metric is constructed by using the harmonic function @xmath5 on a ricci flat base space , in contrast to stationary extremal charged black holes , which have degenerate horizons .",
    "this is similar to the cosmological charged black holes with a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "here we calculate the expansions of the null vector fields emanating from the closed surface @xmath100 on a @xmath99 slice .",
    "the expansions are defined by @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 denote future null vector fields .",
    "we choose the null vector fields @xmath133 such that @xmath134 where @xmath135 are null vectors in the direction of increasing / decreasing @xmath38 coordinate , respectively .",
    "the vectors @xmath135 are regular in the far region , @xmath136 , and they satisfy the relations @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",

    "the universe has a future null infinity in the late time and a timelike singularity in the early stage . inside of the black hole horizon , @xmath157 , there are also timelike singularities .",
    "we give a c@xmath0 extension of the spacetime across the event horizon @xmath14 .",

    "therefore , a free - falling observer can traverse the horizon .",
    "in contrast to the fact that the five - dimensional stationary squashed kaluza - klein black hole solutions @xcite have smooth horizons , the five - dimensional dynamical kaluza - klein black hole has weakly singular event horizon .",

    "similarly , the solution in the present paper is constructed by a harmonic function on a ricci flat base space . however , the base space in the present case has the time - variable as a parameter .",
    "this is the reason why the solution is dynamical .",
    "resultant black hole has non - degenerate horizon in this case .",
    "it is worth noting that the set of metric and maxwell field is also a solution of the einstein - maxwell - chern - simons system .    in the late time , though the size of extra dimension in the far region shrinks to a smaller size than that of the black hole , the event horizon does not change in its size . indeed , the total spacetime is dynamical , but the geometry of near the event horizon is static .",
    "the expansion of the outgoing null geodesic congruence emanating from the event horizon is vanishing , i.e. , the event horizon is an apparent horizon even though the spacetime is dynamical .",
    "we can understand this result as follows . in static vacuum",
    "kaluza - klein black hole solutions  @xcite , the horizons are flattened as the size parameters of the extra dimension become small .",
    "in contrast , in the case of charged kaluza - klein black holes  @xcite , the horizon can be fat and round against to the small extra dimension .",
    "thus , we would expect that the existence of electric charge stabilizes the size of black hole against shrinking extra dimension of the kaluza - klein universe in the present solution .",
    "the solution can be easily generalized to multi - black hole solution . in this solution ,",
