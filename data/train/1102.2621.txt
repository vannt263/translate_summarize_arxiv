    "the purpose of this paper is to explain the recent work of the three authors on the classification of localising and colocalising subcategories of triangulated categories @xcite , and to put it into context . in order to be as concrete as possible ,",
    "we restrict our attention to categories associated with the modular representation theory of finite groups . a more leisurely discussion , filling in requisite background from commutative algebra and triangulated categories , is given in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group and let @xmath1 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath2 . with a few exceptions in characteristic two ,",
    "if the sylow @xmath3-subgroups of @xmath0 are non - cyclic then the group algebra @xmath4 has wild representation type . we therefore do not hope to classify the indecomposable finitely generated @xmath4-modules , and so we are left with several options .",
    "we can restrict the kinds of modules that we re interested in ; we can look for properties of modules that we can prove without the need for a classification ; or we look for coarser classification theorems .",
    "examples abound of all three types of approach ; we shall be examining the last option .    the first indication that it might be possible to make some sort of categorical classification theorem came with mike hopkins 1987 classification @xcite of the thick subcategories of the derived category @xmath5 of perfect complexes over a commutative noetherian ring @xmath6 .",
    "his interest was in the nilpotence theorem for the stable homotopy category , for which he regarded the derived category of perfect complexes as a toy model .",
    "the parametrisation of the thick subcategories was by specialisation closed sets of prime ideals in @xmath6 .",
    "neeman s 1992 paper @xcite took up hopkins work , clarified it and went on to classify the localising subcategories of the unbounded derived category of @xmath6-modules @xmath7 .",
    "this is the appropriate big category whose compact objects are the perfect complexes @xmath5 .",
    "the parametrisation for the localising subcategories was by _ all _ subsets of the set of prime ideals of @xmath6 , not just the specialisation closed ones .",
    "in 1997 , the first author together with carlson and rickard @xcite proved the analogue of hopkins theorem for the stable category @xmath8 of finitely generated @xmath4-modules , over an algebraically closed field @xmath1 of characteristic @xmath3 .",
    "the parametrisation for the thick subcategories was by specialisation closed subsets of homogeneous primes in the cohomology ring @xmath9 , ignoring the maximal ideal of all positive degree elements .",
    "the corresponding big category is the stable category @xmath10 of all @xmath4-modules ; the full subcategory of compact objects in this is the finitely generated stable module category @xmath8 .",
    "it was expected by analogy with @xmath7 that the classification of localising subcategories of @xmath10 would be by all subsets of the set of non - maximal homogeneous primes in @xmath9 .",
    "but this turned out to be very hard to prove , and it was not until a couple of years ago that we managed to achieve this classification @xcite .",
    "more recently , in 2009 neeman @xcite classified the colocalising subcategories of @xmath7 ; the corresponding classification for @xmath10 is given in @xcite .",

    "it is an easy exercise using the group basis to show that @xmath4 is self - dual as a @xmath4-module .",
    "this implies that every projective module is injective . for the converse ,",
    "we note that every @xmath4-module @xmath14 embeds in a free @xmath4-module , via the map @xmath15 sending @xmath16 to @xmath17 . here , we make @xmath18 into a @xmath4-module via @xmath19 ; thus a @xmath1-basis of @xmath14 gives a free @xmath4-basis for @xmath18 . if @xmath14 is injective then this embedding splits and @xmath14 is a summand of a free module , hence projective .",
    "projective @xmath4-modules are well understood .",
    "every projective is a direct sum of finitely generated projective indecomposables , and every projective indecomposable is the projective cover of a simple module .    to work `` modulo projectives '' , we use the _ stable module category _ @xmath10 .",
    "this has the same objects as the module category , but the morphisms are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the linear subspace of maps that factor through some projective module .",
    "we write @xmath8 for the full subcategory of @xmath10 whose objects are the modules stably isomorphic to finitely generated modules .",
    "notice that if a map between finitely generated modules factors through some projective module then it factors through a finitely generated projective module .",
    "the subcategory @xmath8 is distinguished categorically as the _ compact objects _ in @xmath10 .    an object @xmath14 in @xmath10 is said to be _ compact _ if given any small coproduct @xmath22 , the natural map @xmath23 is an isomorphism .",
    "although @xmath10 and @xmath8 are not abelian categories , they come with a natural structure of triangulated category .",

    "the distinguished triangles @xmath26 are by definition those isomorphic to diagrams coming from a short exact sequence @xmath27 of modules as follows . given such a short exact sequence ,",
    "we embed @xmath28 into an injective module @xmath29 and obtain the following commutative diagram with exact rows : @xmath30&a\\ar[r]\\ar@{=}[d]&b\\ar[r]\\ar[d]&c\\ar[r]\\ar[d]&0\\\\ 0\\ar[r]&a\\ar[r]&i\\ar[r]&\\omega^{-1}(a)\\ar[r]&0.}\\ ] ] this gives us a map @xmath31 which is well defined in @xmath10 .",
    "the right hand square in this diagram gives us a short exact sequence @xmath32 since @xmath33 is isomorphic to @xmath34 in @xmath10 , applying the construction again gives rise to the rotated triangle @xmath35    most of the axioms for a triangulated category are easy to verify .",
    "the only one that needs any comment is the octahedral axiom , which is the expression in @xmath10 of the third isomorphism theorem in @xmath12 .",

    "for any triangulated category @xmath36 , a _ thick subcategory _",
    "@xmath37 is a full triangulated subcategory that is closed under taking finite direct sums and summands .",
    "it is worth spelling out what this means for the stable module category .",
    "being a full triangulated subcategory means that the subcategory is closed under @xmath25 and @xmath24 , and it has the _ two in three property _ : given a triangle in the stable module category for which two of the objects are in @xmath37 , so is the third .",
    "pulling back to @xmath13 , thick subcategories of @xmath8 are in one to one correspondence with the subcategories @xmath38 of @xmath13 with the following properties :    1 .",
