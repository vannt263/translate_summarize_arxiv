    "the discovery of the @xmath2 meson by the collider detector at fermilab(cdf ) collaboration  @xcite in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 tev and the subsequent measurement of its lifetime have provided a new window for the analysis of the heavy - quark dynamics and thus for an important test of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "recently the cdf and d0 collaborations announced some new measurements of the @xmath2 meson lifetime and mass  @xcite , @xmath6 ps  @xcite , @xmath7 mev  @xcite , and @xmath8 mev  @xcite .",
    "the lhc is expected to produce around @xmath9 @xmath2 events per year  @xcite .",
    "this will provide more detailed information on the decay properties of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "since the @xmath2 mesons carry flavor explicitly(@xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and can not annihilate into gluons , they are stable against strong and electromagnetic annihilation processes .",
    "the decays of the @xmath2 meson are therefore only via weak interactions , which can be divided into three classes at the quark level : ( 1 ) the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) transition with the @xmath11 quark being a spectator , ( 2 ) the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) transition with the @xmath10 quark being a spectator , and ( 3 ) the weak annihilation channels .",
    "although the phase space of the @xmath16 transitions is much smaller than the phase space of the @xmath17 transitions , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix elements are greatly in favor of the @xmath11 quark decay , i.e.@xmath18 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath11-quark decays provide about @xmath19 of the @xmath2 decay width while the @xmath10-quark decays and the weak annihilation yield about 20@xmath20 and 10@xmath20 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that both @xmath10-and @xmath11-quark decay processes contribute to the @xmath2 decay width on a comparable footing .",
    "because the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks can decay individually and the @xmath2 meson has a sufficiently large mass , one can study a great variety of decay channels .",
    "there have been many theoretical efforts to calculate the semileptonic  @xcite and non - leptonic  @xcite decays of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "the semileptonic @xmath2 decays provide a good opportunity to measure not only the ckm elements such as @xmath21 , @xmath22,@xmath23 and @xmath24 but also the weak form factors for the transitions of @xmath2 to bottom and charmed mesons .",
    "the nonleptonic @xmath2 decays , in which only hadrons appear in the final state , are strongly influenced by the confining color forces among the quarks .",
    "while in the semileptonic transitions the long - distance qcd effects are described by a few hadronic form factors parametrizing the hadronic matrix elements of quark currents , the nonleptonic processes are complicated by the phenomenon of the quark rearrangement due to the exchange of soft and hard gluons .",
    "the theoretical description of the nonleptonic decays involves the matrix elements of the local four - quark operators .",
    "although the four - quark operators are more complicate than the current operators involved in the semileptonic decays , the nonleptonic decays of the heavy mesons are useful for exploring the most interesting aspect of the qcd , i.e. its nonperturbative long - range character .    in our recent paper  @xcite , we analyzed the semileptonic @xmath2 decays such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 using our light - front quark model(lfqm ) based on the qcd - motivated effective lf hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the weak form factors @xmath27 for the semileptonic decays between two pseudoscalar mesons are obtained in the @xmath28 frame ( @xmath29 ) and then analytically continued to the timelike region by changing @xmath30 to @xmath31 in the form factor .",
    "the covariance ( i.e. , frame independence ) of our model has been checked by performing the lf calculation in the @xmath28 frame in parallel with the manifestly covariant calculation using the exactly solvable covariant fermion field theory model in @xmath32 dimensions .",
    "we also found the zero - mode contribution to the form factor @xmath33 and identified the zero - mode operator that is convoluted with the initial and final state lf wave functions .    in this paper , we extend our previous lfqm analysis of the semileptonic @xmath2 decays  @xcite to the nonleptonic two - body decays of @xmath2 mesons such as @xmath34 and @xmath35(here @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons , respectively ) . the qcd factorization approach is widely used since it works reasonably well in heavy - quark physics  @xcite .",
    "the factorization approximates the complicated non - leptonic decay amplitude into the product of the meson decay constant and the form factor . a justification of this assumption is usually based on the idea of color transparency  @xcite .",
    "we shall use the form factors for semileptonic @xmath38 decays as well as the meson decay constants obtained in our lfqm  @xcite as input parameters for the nonleptonic @xmath2 decays . as done by many others  @xcite",
    ", we consider only the contribution of current - current operators at the tree level and calculate the decay widths for various nonleptonic @xmath2 decays . as far as the decay width is concerned , the contribution from the tree diagram is much larger than that from the penguin diagram .",
    "the penguin contribution may be important in evaluating the @xmath39 violation and looking for new physics beyond the standard model , which we do not consider in this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the weak hamiltonian responsible for the nonleptonic two - body decays of the @xmath2 meson . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the input parameters such as the weak decay constants and the form factors obtained in our lfqm  @xcite based on the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the mixing angles between @xmath40 and @xmath41 mesons are also analyzed , both in octet - singlet and quark - flavor bases , to extract the decay constants relevant to @xmath40 and @xmath41 mesons .",
    "section iv is devoted to the numerical results .",
    "a summary and conclusions follow in sec.v .",
    "the nonleptonic weak decays are described in the standard model by a single @xmath42 boson exchange diagram at tree level . in the standard model ,",
    "the nonleptonic @xmath2 decays are described by the effective hamiltonian , which was obtained by integrating out the heavy @xmath42 boson and top quark . for the case of @xmath17 and @xmath16 transitions at the quark level , neglecting qcd penguin operators , one gets the following effective weak hamiltonian : [ hbcu ] h^bc(u)_eff&=&\\ { v_cb[c_1()o^cb_1 + c_2()o^cb_2 ] + & & + v_ub[c_1()o^ub_1 + c_2()o^ub_2 ] + h.c . } , and [ hcsd ] h^cs(d)_eff&=&\\ { v_cd[c_1()o^cd_1 + c_2()o^cd_2 ] + & & + v_cs[c_1()o^cs_1 + c_2()o^cs_2 ] + h.c . } , where @xmath43 is the fermi coupling constant and @xmath44 are the corresponding ckm matrix elements .",
    "we use the central values of the ckm matrix elements quoted by the particle data group(pdg )  @xcite that we summarize in table  [ t1n ] .",
    ".values for ckm matrix elements used in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in our numerical calculations of exclusive @xmath2 decays , we use two sets of model parameters ( @xmath45 ) for the linear and ho confining potentials given in table  [ t2n ] to compute the weak form factors for semileptonic @xmath38 decays and the unmeasured decay constants as given in tables  [ t3n ] and  [ t4n ] , respectively . using them together with the ckm matrix elements given by table  [ t1n ] we finally predict the branching ratios which are given in tables  [ t5 ] and  [ t6 ] . although we show the form factors in table  [ t3n ] only at a maximum recoil point @xmath46 , we use the form factor at @xmath47 obtained from  @xcite for the corresponding nonleptonic @xmath48 decays .    in table  [ t5 ] we show the nonleptonic decay widths of the @xmath2 meson for a general value of the wilson coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 , whereas in table  [ t6 ] we give the corresponding branching ratios ( in @xmath20 ) at the fixed choice of wilson coefficients  @xcite : @xmath51 and @xmath52 relevant for the nonleptonic decays of the @xmath53 quark . for the lifetime of the @xmath2 , we take the central value @xmath54 ps ( i.e. @xmath55 gev ) presented in pdg  @xcite . our branching ratios for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 induced decays listed in table  [ t6 ] are generally close to the other quark model results  @xcite but differ substantially from the ones obtained by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the relative size of the branching ratios for various decay modes may be estimated from power counting of the wilson coefficients @xmath56 and the ckm factors with respect to the small parameter of the cabibbo angle @xmath57 in the wolfenstein parametrization  @xcite , e.g. the ckm matrix elements can be expanded in terms of @xmath58 as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . from tables",
    "[ t5 ] and  [ t6 ] , we make the following observations :    \\(1 ) the class i decay modes determined by the wilson coefficient @xmath49 have comparatively large branching ratios .",
    "the ckm favored @xmath11 decays such as @xmath65 decays with the ckm factor @xmath66 have branching ratios of the order of @xmath67 ( e.g. @xmath68 in our model predictions ) , which are the most promising class i decay modes shown in tables  [ t5 ] and  [ t6 ] .",
    "the ckm - suppressed @xmath11 decays such as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 , as well as the ckm - suppressed @xmath10 decays such as @xmath73 with @xmath74 , have branching ratios of the order of @xmath75 and should still be accessible at high luminosity hadron colliders . however , the branching ratios of the @xmath76 induced decay modes are too small @xmath77 to be measured experimentally .",
    "\\(2 ) the branching ratios for the class ii decay modes determined by @xmath50 are relatively smaller than those for the class i decay modes",
    ". however , the @xmath78 decays with @xmath79 have branching ratios of the order of @xmath75 and these modes should be accessible experimentally . of interest is the abnormally small branching ratio of @xmath80 compared to that of @xmath81 . as stated in  @xcite ,",
    "the reason for such a small branching ratio is not only because the available physical phase space is too small but also because there are large destructive interferences between @xmath82 and @xmath83 due to the serious cancellation between the ckm factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "\\(3 ) the class iii decay modes involve the pauli interference . taking into account the negative value of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath49",
    ", one can see that the class iii decay modes shown in table  [ t5 ] should be suppressed in comparison with the cases in which the interference is switched off . in order to test the effects of the interference",
    ", one may put the widths in the form of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and then compute the @xmath89 ( in @xmath20 ) as done in  @xcite .",
    "our absolute values of @xmath89 obtained from the linear ( ho ) model are 34.0 ( 34.0)@xmath20 for @xmath90 , 37.3 ( 42.4)@xmath20 for @xmath91 , 18.4 ( 15.1)@xmath20 for @xmath92 , and 20.2 ( 18.9)@xmath20 for @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the interference is the most significantly involved in the @xmath91 decay compared to others .",
    "in particular , the @xmath94 and @xmath95 decay modes have been proposed in  @xcite for the extraction of the ckm angle @xmath96 through amplitude relations .",
    "in this work , we have studied the exclusive nonleptonic @xmath97 decays where the final state @xmath98 mesons are factored out in the qcd factorization approach .",
    "the inputs used to obtain their branching ratios were the weak form factors for the semileptonic @xmath38 decays in the whole kinematical region and the unmeasured weak decay constants obtained from our previous lfqm analysis  @xcite .",
    "for the measured values of decay constants , we use the central values extracted from the experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "our predictions for the branching ratios are summarized in tables  [ t5 ] and  [ t6 ] and compared with other theoretical results .",
    "overall , the class ii decay modes have more discrepancies among the theoretical models than the class i and iii decay modes do .",
    "the upcoming experimental measurements of the corresponding decay rates can examine various theoretical approaches .",
    "the most promising measurable decay modes appear to be the ckm favored @xmath11 decays such as @xmath65 decays .",
    "it is thus expected that the dominant contribution to the @xmath2 total rate comes from the @xmath11 induced decays .",
    "the more @xmath11 induced @xmath99 and @xmath100 decay modes seem to deserve further consideration .    the work of h .-",
