    "entanglement is nowdays considered as a central ressource in quantum information processing .",
    "the large amount of work produced since the beginning of the @xmath0 century to understand the nature of entanglement demonstrates the interest of the community in this subject ( see the review papers@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the question of the classification of entanglement of pure multipartite quantum states under the group slocc ( stochastic local operations with classical communication ) is one of the most prominent challenging problems on the road to the understanding of entanglement .",
    "the complexity of this question grows up exponentially with the number of parts composing the quantum system . if the classification problem is completely solved for a few cases , it is known to be out of reach for most general situation ( see ref@xcite for a discussion on the computational complexity of the algebraic invariants of five - qubit systems ) .",
    "the case of the four - qubit hilbert space is of special importance .",
    "first it has generated a large number of papers by itself@xcite .",
    "then , as long as qubits are concerned , it is the only case where the number of slocc orbits is infinite but for which there still exists a list of 9 normal forms found by verstraete _ et al._@xcite ( 6 of them depend on parameters ) which , up to permutation of the qubits , parametrize all slocc orbits ( i.e. up to permutation of the qubits , a given state is in one of the orbit of the 9 families )",
    ". the four - qubit case also showed up in different contexts like in the study of the black - holes - qubits correspondence@xcite , in the study of graph - states@xcite and in many quantum communication protocols like error correcting codes@xcite .",
    "thus we consider the four - qubit case as rich enough to motivate more investigation and develop new tools which we hope to be useful to study more difficult cases .",
    "this paper is part of a sequence of articles@xcite where we have investigated the structure of entanglement for small multipartite systems by combining two different approches : on one side we consider classical invariant theory and we try to understand what the invariants , covariants of the multipartite systems tell us about the slocc - orbits and , on the other side , we look at the geometrical structure of the space by building slocc algebraic varieties . combining the two approaches , we obtain a stratification of the hilbert space by slocc algebraic varieties ( closure of classes or of union of classes ) and criteria based on invariants / covariants , to distinguish them . in our first paper@xcite we provided a geometric description of all entanglement classes with invariants / covariants criteria for hilbert spaces with a finite number of orbits . in ref@xcite",
    "we started to consider the four - qubit case by first looking at specific subvarieties of this hilbert space .",
    "the first subvariety we considered was the nullcone , i.e. the variety of states which annihilate all slocc invariant polynomials .",
    "it turns out that the number of orbits contained in this variety is finite and thus the techniques developped in ref@xcite could apply , leading to a classification , of the nilpotent four - qubit states , using covariants . in the same paper we also considered the case of the algebraic variety @xmath1 , the third secant variety ( see below for the definitions ) , defined by the simultaneous vanishing of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the two degree four generators of the ring of slocc invariant polynomials ( see below for the definition ) .",
    "this latter case already contains an infinite number of orbits .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the geometry of the four - qubit hilbert space by considering specific slocc invariant hypersurfaces : the hypersurfaces defined by the vanishing of the invariants of degree four @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the so - called hyperdeterminant@xcite @xmath6 of format @xmath7 .",
    "the idea of studing the geometry of the hypersurface defined by @xmath6 to classify entanglement classes appeared ten years ago in the work of miyake@xcite .",
    "the paper of miyake is based on the study of the singular locus of the hypersurface described ten years earlier by weymann and zelevinsky@xcite . in this article",
    "we go further in the description of the stratification of the ambient space by singular locus of the hyperdeterminant .",
    "we consider singularities leading to deeper stratas and we are able to establish a connection between the statas of the ambient space defined by the singularities of @xmath6 and the @xmath8 families given by verstraete _",
    "et al_. s classification . like in our previous papers@xcite the geometric approach",
    "is combined with a classical invariant theory point of view allowing us to identify the strata to which a given state belongs .",
    "it leads to an algorithm based on invariants and covariants which provides , up to a qubit permutation , the family and parameters of a representative slocc equivalent to a given state .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section [ adjoint ]",
    "we illustrate how the adjoint representation of @xmath9 on its lie algebra @xmath10 is connected to the slocc ( @xmath11 ) orbits of @xmath12 by showing that the generators of the ring of invariants of four - qubit can be obtained by restriction of the generators of the @xmath9 polynomial invariants on @xmath10 .",
    "similarly we show that the discriminant of the adjoint representation of @xmath9 , also known as the defining equation of the dual of the adjoint variety , leads to the @xmath7-hyperdeterminant . in the proof ,",
    "the hyperdeterminant is obtained as the discriminant of a quartic .",
    "this quartic depends on the embedding of @xmath13 in @xmath10 . in section [ invariants ]",
    "we investigate the three quartics corresponding to the three natural embeddings of @xmath13 in @xmath10 .",
    "it leads to a first stratification of the ambient space based on the roots of the quartics .",
    "in particular , we show that this stratification provides a diagram of normal forms which is connected to the geometry of a special semiregular polytope : the demitesseract . in section [ geo ] the geometry of slocc hypersurfaces corresponding to specific dual varieties",
    "is investigated .",
    "this section ends with a geometric stratification of the ambient space where the families of the four - qubit classification are in correspondence with geometric stratas .",
    "moreover some of those stratas are given by a simple geometric interpretation in terms of duals of orbits of well known quantum states . finally , combining section [ invariants ] and [ geo ] we give an algorithm based on invariants and covariants of four - qubit to determine the verstraete type of a given state .",
    "section [ conclu ] is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "* notations * + all along the paper a four - qubit state @xmath14 will be denoted by @xmath15 where @xmath16 stand for the vectors of the computational basis .",
    "when not specified the hilbert space @xmath13 will be the space of pure four - qubit quantum states , i.e. @xmath17 and the corresponding slocc group will be slocc=@xmath18 .",

    "the action of the @xmath24 subgroup of @xmath9 , on the space of @xmath25 matrices is used to provide a first classification of slocc orbits of @xmath26 .",
    "this idea is made more precise , and the classification corrected , in the work of chterental and djokovi @xcite where the lie algebra @xmath23 is decomposed under the involution defined by the diagonal matrix @xmath27 :    @xmath28    the @xmath24 invariant subspace @xmath29 is @xmath30 the action of @xmath24 on @xmath29 corresponds to the action of slocc on @xmath31 . the correspondence is given as follows .",

    "the action on @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 .",
    "this action on the space of @xmath33 matrices becomes an action of @xmath24 on @xmath29 .",
    "this is described in ref@xcite via the following unitary matrix ( see also ref @xcite ) : @xmath38 one gets the correspondence : @xmath39 and @xmath40 acts on @xmath29 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath43    the action of @xmath24 on @xmath29 is nothing but the trace of the adjoint action of @xmath9 on @xmath29 .",

    "in other words the generators of @xmath48^{so(2n)}$ ] can be chosen to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the sum of the @xmath58 principal minors .",

    "let us denote them respectively @xmath61 and @xmath62 , their descriptions will be given in the next section .",
    "the restriction of the sum of principal minors @xmath63 and the pfaffian @xmath55 to @xmath29 , i.e. to the vector space @xmath64 leads to the following equalities : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it immediately proves that @xmath69^{so(8)}}_{|\\mathfrak{p}}=\\cc[\\mathcal{h}]^{\\text{slocc}}$ ] .    regarding the dual variety of @xmath47 , we recall that an equation of @xmath70 is known in terms for the simple roots of the lie algebras @xmath53 .",
    "in fact for all simple lie algebras the equation defining the dual of the projectivization of the adjoint orbit is given by the vanishing of the discriminant @xmath71 , i.e. the product of the ( long ) roots of @xmath72 ( see ref@xcite p29 ) .",
    "@xmath73 let @xmath74 and @xmath75 its semi - simple part with eigenvalues @xmath76 .",
    "the roots@xcite of @xmath53 are linear forms on @xmath77 , the cartan subalgebra of @xmath53 , of the form @xmath78 with @xmath79 and such that @xmath80 .",
    "thus if @xmath81 is a root we have @xmath82 and the matrix @xmath83 belongs to @xmath84 if and only if @xmath85 the roots of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath3 , @xmath86 are @xmath87 . using the change of variable @xmath88",
    ", one gets the polynomial @xmath89 whose roots are @xmath90 . taking the discriminant",
    "one obtains : @xmath91 one concludes that @xmath92 .",

    "but it can also be checked that @xmath95 is an equation for the dual variety of @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 is the hyperdeterminant of format @xmath7 . @xmath98",
    "the connection between the slocc orbit structure of four - qubits and the lie algebra @xmath23 is also investigated in a different manner in the work of pter lvay@xcite and more recently in ref@xcite with a construction of the four - qubit invariants from the spin representation of @xmath99 . from a different perspective a connection between four - qubit states and the dynkin diagram @xmath100 ( the dynkin diagram of @xmath23 ) was also pointed out in ref@xcite by constructing simple hypersurface singularities of type @xmath100 and their deformations from four - qubit states .    the embedding of @xmath13 as a subspace of @xmath23 depends on the embedding of the four - qubit state @xmath14 in @xmath101 given by eq ( [ embedd ] ) .",
    "there are two more ways of looking at a four - qubit state as a linear map from @xmath102 to @xmath102 .",
    "those other two representations will give different ways of writing the generators of @xmath45^{\\text{slocc}}$ ] , but also two different types of quartics like the one given by eq ( [ firstquartic ] ) for @xmath103 .",
    "in the next section their role in the classification of the slocc orbits is investigated .",
    "in a general setting , a pure @xmath104-qudit state is an element of the hilbert space @xmath105 with @xmath106 regarded as a multilinear form .",
    "two qudit states are equivalent if they belong to the same orbit for the group @xmath107 . in principle",
    ", one can determine if two states are equivalent by comparing their evaluations on a sufficiently large system of special polynomials ( in the coefficients of the forms and auxiliary variables ) , called concomitants , which are invariant under the action of @xmath108 . in practice , this algorithm can be used only in very few cases , because the number and the size of the polynomials increase exponentially with the number of particles and the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , even the knowledge of a little part of the polynomials gives rise to interesting information about the classification .    in the case of a four - qubit system",
    ", we deal with the quadrilinear form : @xmath109 and the algebra of the polynomial invariants ( polynomials in the coefficients of the forms with no auxiliary variables ) is a free algebra on four generators :    1 .",
    "one of degree 2 : @xmath110 2 .",

    "and one of degree 6 : set @xmath112 . by interpreting this quadratic form as a bilinear form on the three dimensional space , one finds a @xmath113 matrix @xmath114 satisfying @xmath115b_{xy}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}y_0 ^ 2\\\\y_0y_1\\\\y_1 ^ 2 \\end{array}\\right ] .",

    "another auxiliary variety of importance is the so - called tangential variety which corresponds to the union of tangent lines . if @xmath202 is a smooth variety and @xmath209 denotes the embedded tangent space of @xmath202 at @xmath210 we have .",
    "@xmath211    this variety has also a nice quantum information theory interpretation . for any multipartite system we have , if @xmath199 still denotes the variety of separable states , @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the generalization of the w - states .",
    "those are well - known fact from algebraic geometry@xcite and have been restated in the language of quantum information theory in ref@xcite .    in our geometric description of the stratification of the ambient space by algebraic varieties",
    "we will also use the concept of dual variety .",
    "let us remind what the dual variety of a projective algebraic variety is , and why this concept has been already introduced in the study of entanglement of multipartite systems@xcite .",
    "if @xmath199 is a @xmath218-invariant variety for a @xmath218-action on @xmath219 and @xmath220 is a hypersurface , then the defining equation of @xmath220 is a @xmath218-invariant polynomial . in the case of @xmath221 with @xmath222 ( assuming @xmath223 ) the dual variety is always a hypersurface called the hyperdeterminant of format @xmath224 and it is a @xmath225-invariant polynomial .",
    "hyperdeterminants have been deeply studied by gelfand kapranov and zelevinsky@xcite .    in the case where @xmath226 , the hyperdeterminant of format @xmath227 is the so - called cayley hyperdeterminant and when @xmath198 , the hyperdeterminant is the invariant polynomial @xmath6 introduced in section [ invariants ] .",
    "the three hypersurfaces defined by the vanishing of one of the quartic invariant polynomials @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath5 are isomorphic and correspond to the dual varieties of three different types of embeddings of @xmath231 in @xmath232 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath233 be two @xmath234 matrices which are tensors of rank at most two , i.e. @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "then we have the following three embeddings : @xmath237,[b ] ) & \\hookrightarrow & [ t_1\\otimes u_1\\otimes v_1\\otimes w_1 + t_1\\otimes u_1\\otimes v_2\\otimes w_2\\\\ & & & + t_2\\otimes u_2\\otimes v_1\\otimes w_1 + t_2\\otimes u_2\\otimes v_2\\otimes w_2]\\\\ \\phi_2 : & ( [ a],[b ] ) & \\hookrightarrow & [ w_1\\otimes u_1\\otimes v_1\\otimes t_1 + w_1\\otimes u_1\\otimes v_2\\otimes t_2\\\\ & & & + w_2\\otimes u_2\\otimes v_1\\otimes",

    ". indeed , more permutations will not give any new varieties .",
    "for instance exchanging the vectors @xmath239 and @xmath240 in @xmath241 to construct an other map @xmath242 will not give anything new because @xmath243,[b])=\\tilde{\\phi}_1([^ta],[b])$ ] .",
    "we will denote by @xmath244 , for @xmath245 , the three segre embeddings of @xmath246 . from a qit perspective",
    ", it should be pointed out that the segre embedding of @xmath247 corresponds to the algebraic closure of the product of two @xmath248 states , i.e. for @xmath241 we have @xmath249          and @xmath256 let us denote by @xmath257 the state obtained from @xmath14 by permuting the qubits by @xmath258 .",
    "then , it is clear that @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "it is well known that the ",
    "segre product of two projective spaces @xmath261 corresponds to the projectivization of the variety of rank one matrices in the projectivization of the space of @xmath262 matrices . taking the sum of two matrices of rank one ,",
    "one gets a matrix of rank at most two and therefore the secant variety @xmath263 can be interpreted as the projectivization of the locus of rank at most two matrices .",
    "when taking higher secants we get the well known stratification of bipartite systems by their rank@xcite @xmath264 in @xmath265 the presence of the three varieties @xmath266 will induce a first stratification of the ambient space .",
    "recall the binary shortened notation @xmath267 where @xmath268 .",
    "as mentioned in section [ adjoint ] , we can represent a four - qubit state @xmath269 by a @xmath33 matrix @xmath270 similarly we have two alternative embeddings .",
    "@xmath271    if we think in terms of matrix rank , it is clear that the variety @xmath266 is defined by the zero locus of the two by two minors of the matrix @xmath272 , the secant variety @xmath273 is defined by the zero locus of the @xmath113 minors of @xmath272 and the third secant variety @xmath274 is defined by the vanishing of @xmath275 ( figure [ segre ] ) .",
    "@xmath276\\\\   & \\sigma_3(seg_1(\\pp^3\\times\\pp^3)){\\ar@{^{}-}}[d]\\\\ & \\sigma_2(seg_1(\\pp^3\\times\\pp^3)){\\ar@{^{}-}}[d]\\\\ & seg_1(\\pp^3\\times\\pp^3){\\ar@{^{}-}}[d]\\\\ & x=\\pp^1\\times\\pp^1\\times\\pp^1\\times\\pp^1 } \\ ] ]          in a general setting , permuting the qubits in a form induces a permutations on the quadrics @xmath278 .",
