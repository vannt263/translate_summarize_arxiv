    "the classic diffusion equation , based on fick s law , is widely used for approximate description of non - anomalous diffusion ( dispersion of a substance or species )  @xcite and brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "however , fick s law neglects the mass ( inertia ) of moving particles ( molecules ) , and , therefore , the diffusion equation gives an appropriate and accurate model for diffusion phenomena only in weakly inhomogeneous media and/or for processes , which are slow in time , when relaxation time is short compared to a characteristic time scale .",
    "otherwise the description of diffusion by the diffusion equation may fail @xcite .",
    "many biological media , e.g. , cellular cytoplasm , are strongly inhomogeneous , therefore , diffusion in them is not fickian and its description by the diffusion equation is questionable .",
    "note that the counterpart of fick s law is fourier s law in the theory of heat conduction  @xcite .",
    "the latter leads to the heat equation , similar to the diffusion equation .",
    "fick s law was postulated by analogy with fourier s law , which was proposed first  @xcite .",
    "the simplest modification of fick s law , taking into account the inertia of moving particles , is _",
    "cattaneo s equation",
    "strictly speaking , cattaneo s equation modifies fourier s law , since cattaneo considered heat conduction , however , one can apply this to mass transfer as well .",
    "the modification leads to the _ telegraph equation _ , providing the finite speed of propagation @xcite .",
    "the telegraph equation was proposed to be a substitution of the diffusion and heat equations .",
    "however , both two- and three - dimensional telegraph equations meet formal obstacles since solutions to initial value problem for them may become negative @xcite .    long before cattaneo h.jeffreys proposed a relation for rheological description of earth s core @xcite , that can be considered as a combination of fick s ( or fourier s ) law and cattaneo s equation .",
    "we define this the _ law ( relation ) of the jeffreys type_. this law leads to a partial differential equation of the _ third _ order , called the _ equation of the jeffreys type _",
    "@xcite , also known as the simplest equation of the dual phase lag model of heat conduction @xcite .",
    "we call this the _ jeffreys type _ model .",
    "this model was used for description of viscoelastic fluids @xcite , taylor dispersion @xcite and heat transfer @xcite .",
    "there is another _ two - temperature _ @xcite or _ two - phase _",
    "@xcite model , which leads also to the equation of the jeffreys type .",
    "this model is qualitatively different from the jeffreys type one .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , there is no clear distinction between cases when the equation of the jeffreys type describes the jeffreys type and the two - temperature ( two - phase ) models @xcite .",
    "moreover , in ref.@xcite the behaviour of the two - temperature model is illustrated by that of the jeffreys type model .",
    "and in ref.@xcite the authors erroneously state that the two models are equivalent .",
    "the diffusion equation is known to be the simplest approximation to the linear boltzmann equation  @xcite , and the latter can be considered as a mesoscopic model of the former .",
    "it is notable that the telegraph equation is the @xmath2 approximation ( the next after the diffusion one ) to the linear boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath3 approximations to the linear boltzmann equation were proposed  @xcite .",
    "they generalize the classic diffusion approximation , which corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "we have found that the _ @xmath5 approximation _ ( the next after the telegraph one ) leads to the equation of the jeffreys type , the model being qualitatively different from both the jeffreys type and two - phase ones .",
    "note that this model is similar to the one of guyer and krumhansl in the theory of second sound @xcite .",
    "the primary motivation of this study was to investigate the equation of the jeffreys type as a substitution of the diffusion equation instead of the telegraph one for description of mass transfer .",
    "eventually in this paper we study and compare the three models ( the _ jeffreys type _ and _ two - phase _ models , and the _ @xmath5 approximation to the linear boltzmann equation _ ) as models of mass transfer .",
    "we study two classic @xmath1d problems , typical for mass transfer , in the framework of each model , where , as far as we know , the problems have not been studied .",
    "the first problem is the transfer of a substance initially confined in a point .",
    "the second problem is the transfer of a substance from a stationary point source .",
    "we calculate the mean - square displacement ( msd ) for the solutions of the first problem , because the msd is an integral quantity whose temporal dependence characterizes diffusion and brownian motion .",
    "the temporal behaviour of the msd in the framework of the first and third models is found to be the same as that in the brownian motion described by the standard langevin equation .",
    "we remind here that the behaviour of the msd in the framework of the diffusion equation is wrong at small values of time , where it must be ballistic .",
    "besides , we find a remarkable phenomenon when a portion of the substance _ does not move_.    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : diffeq ]",
    "we briefly remind the phenomenological derivation of the diffusion equation . in section",

    "the macroscopic law of mass balance for a substance is expressed by the continuity equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the concentration of the substance , @xmath8 is a point , @xmath9 is time , @xmath10 is the flux of the substance , @xmath11 is the net rate of production or absorption ( degradation ) of the substance .    in the simplest approximation",

    "shows that cattaneo s equation takes into account the prehistory of a process , since flux depends on the gradient of the concentration at earlier time , the dependence being exponentially decreasing with time .",

    "the telegraph equation can also be obtained as the @xmath2 approximation to the linear boltzmann equation  @xcite , see eq ..    the telegraph equation is hyperbolic , providing the finite speed of signal propagation , and it was proposed to be a substitution of the parabolic diffusion and heat equations @xcite . however ,",
    "two- and three - dimensional telegraph equations have a formal flaw since their solutions may take negative values even if the initial values are positive @xcite .",
