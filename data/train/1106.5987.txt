    "the square double quantum well ( dqw ) often is used as a toy model to demonstrate the interaction between quantized energy levels due to particle tunneling through a potential barrier separating individual wells  @xcite .",

    "the tunneling conductance properties of semiconducting dqw devices as well as drag effects that result from interaction between electrons moving at different velocities in different wells was recently discussed , for example , in review articles  @xcite .",
    "appearance of transcendental equations that describe dqw spectrum limits direct application of analytical methods in tackling the eigenfunction problems .",
    "initially the problem of finding the eigenfunctions has been solved by perturbation theory assuming that energy level splitting due to tunneling is small  @xcite .",
    "the most recent analytical approach heavily relies on symmetry properties of the dqw  @xcite .",
    "of course , this restriction can be relaxed by resorting to numerical methods  @xcite . however , in many cases a knowledge of analytical form of the wave function is more preferable .",
    "for example , in the wave packet dynamics problems the closed form solution allows one to construct a direct superposition of eigenfunctions to make a computational task easy .",
    "here we demonstrate that one can push the problem further and calculate the relevant eigenfunctions exactly by exploiting a computer based grbner basis algorithm  @xcite . in sections  [ sec:2 ] and  [ sec:3 ] the spectrum and eigenfunctions of a general dqw",
    "are calculated using the grbner basis , and in section  [ sec:4 ] the results are applied to find closed form expression for optical dipole matrix element of the dqw .",
    "the one - dimensional dqw with flat potentials in each of regions @xmath0 , as shown in , is described by the following piecewise function of coordinate @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the confining potential ( referenced from the bottom of wells ) and @xmath4 is the height of central barrier separating two identical quantum wells .",

    "the energy @xmath12 is referenced from the bottom of the wells .",
    "the wave vectors of evanescent waves in the exponents are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where we have introduced different electron masses , namely , @xmath15 inside the wells , @xmath16 in the barrier and @xmath17 in the confining potential .",
    "this is typical to semiconductor heterostructures , where the dqw is made of nanometer layers having different forbidden energy gaps . as a result ,",
    "the electron effective mass depends on coordinate @xmath1 .    in equations",
    "there are eight unknown coefficients that must be calculated .",
    "because of symmetry , the number of coefficients , in fact , can be reduced .",
    "however we shall not do this since the grbner basis algorithm will take account of symmetry properties of polynomials automatically .",

    "when the dqw heterostructure is fabricated from two types of nanolayers ( labelled @xmath5 and @xmath37 ) we have that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "when the barrier width @xmath47 , equation   goes back to the well known formula for an isolated quantum well .",
    "when the particle energy @xmath12 is larger than the height @xmath4 of the barrier but smaller than the confining potential , @xmath48 , the particle still remains localized .",
    "the only difference is that in the regions @xmath49 wave function now oscillates , i.e. the eigenfunctions @xmath8 here are described by trigonometric functions only .",
    "it is easy to see that the above solution at @xmath50 remains valid if we account for hyperbolic functions properties @xmath51 , @xmath52 and notice that in this case @xmath53 can be replaced by @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficients in the wave function   depend on @xmath34 .",
    "since the spectrum @xmath55 ( or @xmath35 ) is determined by roots of the transcendental equations and , one is obliged to solve these equations using numerical methods . nonetheless , as we shall see",
    ", the eigenfunctions can be explicitly calculated with the help of grbner basis algorithm  @xcite without any reference to the roots at all .",
    "roughly speaking , a grbner basis for a system of polynomial equations is a different system of simpler polynomials having the same roots as the original ones .",
    "calculation of the grbner basis to some extent resembles reduction of square matrix to triangular matrix . for further calculations it is convenient to introduce the following half angle variables @xmath56 and express sine and cosine functions in  and ( or in case of antisymmetric eigenfunctions ) through polynomial variables @xmath1 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 calculating grbner basis for coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 and requesting that new variables @xmath1 and @xmath57 to be eliminated , the _ mathematica _ program generates basis which consists of 146 polynomials . however , it should be stressed that the program can find the grbner basis only if the spectrum equation , either or is appended to the original polynomial system  . the following simplest polynomials were selected for symmetric states @xmath61^{1/2}}\\ , , } \\ ] ] where @xmath62 was replaced by @xmath63 to identify the state symmetry .",

    "it is straightforward to check that the solution indeed satisfies the initial equations  . in all amplitudes are expressed through a single coefficient  @xmath63 , which in turn can be found from the normalization condition of the total wave function @xmath8 .",

    "the knowledge of eigenfunctions allows one to carry on with analytical calculations . as an example we shall find closed form expression for dipole matrix elements between even @xmath81 and odd @xmath82 discrete states @xmath83 here the subscripts @xmath84 and @xmath7 refer to , respectively , even and odd symmetry states and @xmath85  is the contribution of the @xmath86-th region indicated in the  . for a general case the expressions for dipole components @xmath87 are rather complicated  @xcite . for simplicity below we present the expressions for the case when masses in all regions are equal , @xmath88 and the central and confining barrier heights coincide , @xmath89 . since the energy of symmetric and antisymmetric states differ the wave vectors @xmath10 and @xmath90 are supplied by indices @xmath84 and @xmath7 .",

    "then , similar calculation yields @xmath122 , which is independent of barrier width .",
    "the deviations from the obtained expressions in a come from the evanescent mode contribution in barrier and confining potential regions .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presented example shows that application of grbner basis algorithm in some cases allows to find closed form expressions for the total wave function and , therefore , to calculate the dipole matrix elements exactly without directly solving the transcendental equations that determines the spectrum of the dqw .",
