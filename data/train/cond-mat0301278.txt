    "in recent years the field of nonlinear atom optics @xcite has become firmly established both theoretically and experimentally with the demonstration of four - wave mixing in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , coherent matter wave amplification @xcite , the creation of dark @xcite and bright @xcite atomic solitons , the generation of correlated atomic pairs and squeezing @xcite , and the creation of a molecular condensate  the analog of second - harmonic generation in optics @xcite .",
    "so far , this work has been largely limited to bosonic atoms and has been based to a great extent on analogies with nonlinear optics : ultracold bosons interact primarily via @xmath0-wave collisions and typically occupy only a few quantum states , so that their mean - field description in terms of a gross - pitaevskii equation includes a nonlinearity of the same form as a third - order optical kerr nonlinearity , and thus many of the results from nonlinear optics can be directly applied to condensates . in particular ,",
    "bose - einstein condensates are often viewed as a matter - wave equivalent of the optical laser the so called `` atom laser '' .",
    "the last few years have also seen substantial progress in the cooling and trapping of atomic fermi gases to the quantum degenerate regime , with temperatures reaching as low as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi temperature @xcite .",
    "it is therefore only a matter of time before experiments start to probe the dynamics of these gases far from equilibrium and perform fermionic nonlinear atom optics experiments .",
    "however , the extension of the ideas developed in nonlinear optics to fermi systems is by no means obvious or straightforward because of the different quantum statistics obeyed by fermions and bosons .",
    "whereas for bosons the analysis can typically be limited to a few macroscopically occupied modes , the pauli exclusion principle prohibits the number of modes from ever being less than the number of particles for fermions .",
    "this makes both analytical and numerical studies of the dynamics of fermi systems rather challenging , except for very limited situations ( e.g. @xmath3 and weak perturbations ) .",
    "consequently , the idea of doing nonlinear atom optics with fermions is still new and largely unexplored .",
    "it is only recently that it has been convincingly argued that four - wave mixing is possible with fermions @xcite .",
    "these works showed how four - wave mixing can be interpreted in terms of incident particles undergoing bragg scattering off of a fermionic density grating , but were limited to an incident beam consisting of a single test particle .",
    "they also neglected the dynamics of the density grating .",
    "related work has shown that four - wave mixing between a degenerate fermion beam and a bosonic density grating is also possible @xcite . while these results are promising , a complete analysis of purely fermionic four - wave mixing is still lacking .    in a previous paper @xcite , we studied fermionic four - wave mixing using the matter - wave analog of the undepleted pump approximation in optics , i.e. we neglected the back - action of the diffracted atoms on the density grating .",
    "the density grating was formed by atoms in a single hyperfine state prepared in a coherent superposition of the momentum states @xmath4 and @xmath5 for all @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fermi wave number of the grating atoms and @xmath9 the wave number of the density modulation . the third incident wave consisted of a degenerate fermi gas in a different hyperfine state so that the atoms in the beam and grating could interact via @xmath0-wave collisions .",
    "these atoms could then be diffracted by the density grating to produce a fourth , scattered wave .",
    "because of the range of energy states occupied by its constituent atoms , the amplitude of the grating would decay away due to the dephasing of the atoms .",
    "this led to a finite time during which four - wave mixing could occur and placed serious constraints on the properties of the fermions involved .    in this paper , we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by taking into account the back - action of the incident beam on the fermionic density grating .",
    "we find that when the number of atoms in the incident beam becomes a sizable fraction of the number of atoms forming the density grating , it no longer decays away due to the dephasing .",
    "instead , it exhibits large nonlinear amplitude oscillations that are coupled to the bragg oscillations of the beam .",
    "this leads to the efficient generation of the fourth scattered wave , even for times much longer than the grating dephasing time .",
    "we interpret this behavior in terms of a bloch vector picture .",
    "we also evaluate the efficiency for the generation of the scattered wave and show that it should be possible to produce a macroscopic fourth wave .",
    "interestingly enough , we find that the efficiency of the four - wave mixing can be improved significantly by initially preparing a density grating with an amplitude that is less than maximal .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the model developed in @xcite .",
    "section iii presents numerical results that show how the dephasing of the grating can be eliminated when the back - action becomes significant .",
    "the efficiency of the four - wave mixing is also calculated and it is shown that a macroscopic fourth wave can be readily produced . finally , section iv is a summary and conclusion .",
    "the appendix presents an analytically soluble model in terms of coupled bloch vectors that yields a qualitative interpretation of our results .",
    "in this section we briefly review the one - dimensional model developed in @xcite to study four - wave mixing between fermions at zero temperature .",
    "we consider two spin - polarized species of fermions a density grating composed of spin - up polarized atoms and an incident beam of spin - down polarized atoms , see fig .",

    "atoms in different spin states interact via elastic @xmath0-wave scattering .",

    "it is usually possible to reduce the problem of four - wave mixing to a two - dimensional planar geometry , with one dimension parallel to the density grating .",
    "since the momentum transfer to the beam atoms is parallel to the density modulation of the grating , the essential dynamics of the wave mixing process occurs only in that @xmath11-direction .",
    "we assume that the grating is confined between @xmath12 to @xmath13 along the perpendicular @xmath14 axis . if the average momentum , @xmath15 , of the atomic beam along that direction is sufficiently large that @xmath16 , then the requirements of energy and momentum conservation insure that @xmath17 remains practically unchanged by the scattering . in this case ,",
    "wave mixing in two or three dimensions is in essence the same as in the one - dimensional model that we consider .",

    "the dynamics of the system is conveniently described in terms of the particle - hole operators @xmath29 that create a particle in state @xmath30 and a hole in @xmath6 for the beam and grating , respectively .",
    "they obey the heisenberg equations of motion @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we consider a beam of @xmath33 atoms propagating along the @xmath34-direction , but with a small momentum component around a central value @xmath35 parallel to the grating , which is taken to be in a superposition of the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the fermi momentum ( in one dimension ) and @xmath38 is the number of atoms in the grating .",
    "such a grating can be created from a stationary homogeneous gas by a two - step process where first a two - photon bragg @xmath39-pulse imparts a momentum @xmath40 to each atom , followed by a second bragg pulse with momentum @xmath41 that creates the desired superposition ( see e.g. ref .",
    "( note that the bandwidth of the pulses should be greater than @xmath42 . )",
    "thus the initial state of the beam - grating system is @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 being the fermi momentum of the beam .",
    "the initial expectation values of the particle - hole operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are readily found to be @xmath48 we note that the spatial density of the fermi gas is given by @xmath49 from which it is clear that the density for the initial state of the spin - up polarized grating atoms exhibits as expected a spatial modulation with the grating wave number @xmath9 and an amplitude @xmath50 . in contrast , the spin - down polarized incident beam has a uniform density .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the slowly varying particle - hole operators @xmath51 whose heisenberg equation of motion simply become    @xmath52    in the following we factorize the expectation values of these operators for different spin states , @xmath53 this ansatz results in the truncation of the bbgky - type hierarchy of equations of motion for the higher - order moments of the particle - hole operators after the first moments @xcite , yielding the closed set of @xmath54-number equations @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these equations can be readily integrated numerically .",
    "implicit in eqs .",
    "( [ integrated_c ] ) and ( [ initial_state ] ) are the three fundamental time scales that govern the dynamics of the interaction between the beam and the grating .",
    "the first time scale is associated with the kinetic energy @xmath58 gained by an atom scattered by the grating .",
    "the other two time scales are associated with the density grating itself . if , for the moment , we revert to the undepleted pump approximation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath59 , then we obtain the linear equations of motion for the beam , @xmath60 here @xmath61 where the second equality was obtained in the continuum limit , @xmath62 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath63 is proportional to the amplitude of the density grating , which decays to zero in a time of the order of @xmath64 this decay is caused by the spread in energies of the fermions that comprise the grating , @xmath65 , so that the different energy states in the grating get out of phase with each other over time .",
    "this leads to an effective grating lifetime of the order of @xmath66 , which corresponds to the relative phases of the different states being of order unity .",
    "the third time scale is given by the characteristic time @xmath67 for atoms to scatter off of the grating in the limit of a static grating ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "for an incident particle with momentum @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the frequency of oscillations between the degenerate states @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in the bragg regime that we consider in this paper , both the kinetic energy and the momentum of the atoms are conserved by the scattering process .",
    "this corresponds to the condition , @xmath73 the population that develops in states centered around @xmath74 is then at most on the order of @xmath75 .",
    "if we choose the average momentum of the beam as @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , only states centered around @xmath72 are phase - matched to the states in the incident beam , so that we can restrict ourselves to those @xmath6 states within a width @xmath78 of @xmath69 .",
    "( this is in contrast to the raman - nath regime , where the change in the kinetic energy of an atom as result of scattering off of the grating is negligible compared to the interaction energy with the grating @xcite . )    in the undepleted pump approximation it is important that the scattering time be less than the lifetime of the grating , @xmath79 otherwise there is no significant scattering beam generated .",
    "however , as we show in the next section , four - wave mixing can continue for times much longer than @xmath80 when the effects of the back - action on the grating become significant .",
    "in this section we study the phenomena in fermionic four - wave mixing resulting from the back - action of the atomic beam on the grating .",

    ", the back - action of the beam on the grating manifests itself in the small amplitude oscillations superimposed on the sinc function behavior of @xmath100 .",

    "<S> we analyze the full nonlinear dynamics of the four - wave mixing between an incident beam of fermions and a fermionic density grating . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the number of atoms in the beam is comparable to the number of atoms forming the grating , the dephasing of that grating , which normally leads to a decay of its amplitude , is suppressed . instead , the density grating and the beam density exhibit large nonlinear coupled amplitude oscillations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> four - wave mixing can persist for much longer times compared to the case of negligible back - action . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the efficiency of the four - wave mixing and show that it can be enhanced by producing an initial density grating with an amplitude that is less than the maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that efficient four - wave mixing in fermionic alkali gases should be experimentally observable . </S>"
