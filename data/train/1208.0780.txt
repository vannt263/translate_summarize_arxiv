    "the proto - star is hidden by its parent circumstellar material and thus can only be observed as far - ir emission from the warm , dusty envelope ( class 0 ) .",
    "this envelope becomes less dense in class i objects .",

    "the disk still causes an ir excess over photospheric stellar emission . on the star itself accretion shocks and coronal activity lead to x - ray emission @xcite .",

    "( weak - line t  tauri stars = wtts ) cluster members can not be distinguished from main - sequence ( ms ) stars by ir observations .",

    "for example , in @xmath1  oph suggested that the expanding shell of the upper sco star forming region travelled through the cloud and triggered the star formation .",

    "this effect can shift ages by 50 - 100% or introduce scatter of the same order , if different objects have varying accretion rates .",
    "all this will cause an apparent spread in luminosity .",

    "[ fig : rriyso ] , since the younger members are likly too embedded to be observed in @xmath23 and thus would not be shown in the figure .",

    "this indicates that the non - detection of x - rays is not caused by higher extinction but is intrinsic to the sources , i.e. objects fainter in the ir are weaker x - ray emitters and thus remain undetected .",

    "the regions of the highest absorbing column densities are all part of cluster core  w , thus this should show the lowest x - ray detection fraction , if the luminosities are uniform , contrary to the observed distribution .",
    "also , stars in cluster core  w are brighter in k band than sources in the other regions .",
    "this might indicate an evolutionary trend : cluster core  w still contains many class  i sources and also the class  ii sources could on average be younger and less contracted .",
    "this would explain the higher k band luminosity and also the higher x - ray flux , since @xcite show that the x - ray flux is linearly related to the surface area , such that larger ysos have a higher luminosity .",
    "some cluster members have been identified by their x - ray emission in sect .",
    "[ sect : xraysources ] , but for an ir selected sample table  [ tab : sources ] shows that the x - ray detection fraction increases with the evolutionary status of the sources from class  i * to class  ii*. this is expected because the envelope of younger objects absorbs the soft x - rays and thus reduces the observable flux . in the following",
    ", we present results for fits to the x - ray spectra ( see sect .  [ sect : chandra ] ) .",
    "because of the low signal the fit does not converge for all sources and we ignore those fits , where the statistical error on the fit value includes the complete parameter space .",

    "the probability that class  i and ii sources are drawn from the same sample is 23% .",

    "this has also been observed in other star foming regions e.g. the onc @xcite or ngc  1333 @xcite .    while the deeply embedded sources may remain undetected , so that the figure does not represent the complete distribution of extinctions , the differences in the distribution of @xmath15 between different classes are real .",
    "both class  i objects with fits have @xmath36  @xmath37 , much greater than the average class  ii or iii source . less absorbed sources are easier to detect and if less absorbed class  i sources were present , they would have been detected .",
    "the lower detection fraction of younger sources in x - rays ( table  [ tab : sources ] ) means , that class  i sources are fainter or they are so deeply embedded that the detections in fig .",

    "thus , we conclude that sources with larger infrared excesses are indeed more absorbed in x - rays .      figure  [ fig : kt ] shows the distribution of temperatures for the different classes ( open histograms ) .",
    "clearly , class  i sources are on average hotter than the other sources",
    ". however , this could be due to a detection bias : class  i sources are generally more absorbed , thus soft x - ray emission remains undetected . to avoid this problem a subsample with similar @xmath15",
    "can be used to compare the temperatures , because all sources suffer the same bias towards higher temperatures . unfortunately",
    ", the low number of sources requires a relatively broad range of @xmath38  @xmath39 in order to retain a sufficient number of sources ( hatched histograms ) .",
    "this interval contains both class  i sources .",
    "although a ks test is not strictly valid for such small numbers , it indicates that the distribution of the plasma temperatures for class  ii and iii sources in this subsample differs from the distribution in the full sample , because lower temperature plasma remains undetected .",
    "the subsample contains 2 class  i sources , 6 class  ii sources and 3 class  iii sources . even in this small subsample",
    "a ks test shows that the three temperature distributions are incompatible . the class  i sources are hotter than the class  ii sources and those in turn are hotter than the class  iii soures",
    ". however , there may still be a bias , because class  ii and iii sources are mostly on the lower end of the @xmath15 range in the subsample . due to the larger source numbers we can repeat this test for class  ii and iii sources in smaller @xmath15 bins . for @xmath40  @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath41  @xmath37 and @xmath42  @xmath37 the mean temperature of the class  ii sources is always higher than for class  iii sources and the probabilities that the temperatures for the two classes are drawn for the same distribution are @xmath431% , 3% and 15% , respectively .",

    "however , the spectral models we use are based on a single temperature .",
    "this is an adequate description of the observed data with its low signal , but we know from observations of closer ctts and wtts that the real temperature structure in coronae is more complex .",
    "also , the comparison in different @xmath15 bins could be flawed , if the @xmath15 is caused by a partial absorber in class  ii or iii sources , because only a part of the x - ray emission is covered by accretion funnels .",
    "both considerations can not be tested with the given data quality , thus we caution that the observed difference in temperature might not represent the real coronal temperature very well .    on first sight , the observed temperature trend seems to contradict the soft excess found in ctts , mostly from line emission @xcite , but _",
    "chandra_/acis is less sensitive at low energies than _ xmm - newton _ and only a very small absorbing column density ( @xmath44  @xmath37 ) is needed to absorb the soft emission .",

    "luminosities for stars with spectral fits are given in table  [ tab : xray ] , but this applies only to a fraction of the ysos with x - ray detections . to estimate a rough luminosity for the remaining sources , we fit a relation between count rate @xmath45 and computed unabsorbed source flux @xmath46 to the ysos with spectral fits .",
    "we find the following relation : @xmath47  erg  s@xmath48  @xmath37  count@xmath48 .",
    "while this is very uncertain for a single star because the proportionality constant really depends on the temperature and absorption , this fit is a reasonable approximation for a sample of stars , because the relation represents the average values of @xmath15 and k@xmath16 for those ysos with spectral fits .",
    "figure  [ fig : ciiwoxrays ] indicates that the x - ray detected sources , at least for class  ii objects , are the brighter in k - band and thus are likely more massive stars . in this case , the sources with weak x - ray emission might just be the less massive and thus intrinsically fainter than their counterparts with x - ray spectral models , but could still have similar @xmath15 and k@xmath16 values .    above @xmath49 the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf )",

    "there is an uncertainty of 0.1 in @xmath24 ( r. gutermuth , personal communication ) .",
    "a linear fit gives the relation @xmath58",
    "@xmath37  mag@xmath48 .",
    "there is no significant difference between class  ii and iii sources and separate fits for cluster core e and w lead to compatible values .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio is lower than the interstellar ratio of @xmath59  @xmath37  mag@xmath48 , where @xmath60 was transformed to @xmath24 with the tabulated @xmath61 of @xcite .",
    "however , values lower than in iras 20050 + 2720 are sometimes seen in young star forming regions , e.g. @xmath62  @xmath37  mag@xmath48 for class  iii sources in @xcite and @xmath63  @xmath37  mag@xmath48 for class  iii sources in serpens . in the @xmath1  oph",

    "find @xmath59  @xmath37  mag@xmath48 , again in agreement with the interstellar ratio .    in an effort to understand this bifurcation",
    ", figure  [ fig : aknh ] also shows @xmath15 vs. @xmath24 for the very different regime of close - by and little absorbed class  ii sources from the sample of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see references therein for data sources ) .",
    "most of those sources have been observed with x - ray grating spectroscopy , thus the @xmath15 values are more reliable even for small column densities . on the other hand , the @xmath60 values for this sample",
    "have been collected from the literature and are derived with different methods . in the plot sources with a literature value of @xmath66 are shown at @xmath67  mag , because it is difficult to measure a small reddening .",
    "most of these sources are found significantly above the @xmath0 of the diffuse ism .",
    "@xcite proposed three possible reasons for the low @xmath0 values .",
    "first , the x - ray temperatures could be systematically underestimated resulting in an over estimate of the @xmath15 values .",
    "only x - ray grating spectroscopy can break the @xmath15 to k@xmath16 degeneracy in the fits .",
    "however , this is not feasible for class ii or iii sources beyond about 150  pc .",
    "second , that the value of @xmath24 has been overestimated due to changes in the form of the reddening law ; however , the required change would be much greater than has so far been observed .",
    "the third reason was that the growth and coagulation of grains would increase the extinction per unit grain mass in the cloud .",
    "they find the first two reasons unlikely , and argue that grain growth is the most likely explanation .",
    "while both @xmath15 and @xmath24 are measures of the material along the line of sight , @xmath15 is essentially a measure of number of atoms while extinction is affected by particle shape and the grain size distribution . in the case of a star , which is surrounded by a disk and",
    "has a gas accretion column , there are various layers which can have different particle shapes and grain size distributions .",
    "nonetheless , in iras 20050 + 2720 class  ii and iii sources show the same @xmath0 ratio , although class  ii sources have more circumstellar material .",
    "thus , either the extinction laws of the circumstellar material and the cloud are similar or the circumstellar extinction is not a significant contributor to the total extinction .",
    "if we view @xmath0 as a gas - to - dust ratio , iras 20050 + 2720 , serpens and ngc 1333 are dust rich ( or gas poor ) , compared with the interstellar extinction . in contrast , the sample from @xcite shows most sources to be dust depleted ( or gas enriched ) with much lower absolute values for the extinction .",
    "these sources are mostly from the taurus - auriga molecular cloud complex , which does not have the high density cluster cores seen in iras 20050 + 2720 , serpens and ngc  1333 , and contributes little to the line - of - sight extinction .",
    "thus , their extinction should be dominated by circumstellar material , which could be dust - depleted due to the energy input from the star , gravitational settling of grains in the disk - midplane and planet formation .",
    "in contrast , in the younger star forming regions , we mostly see the cloud material .",
    "although we can not rule out that these clouds could be dust - rich ( perhaps from a high abundance of carbon ) or poor in x - ray absorbing metals , there is no independent evidence for these explanations .",
    "alternatively , grain growth and coagulation can lead to an increase in the extinction per hydrogen atom in the near ir - bands @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a decrease in the ratio of the depth of the 9.7  @xmath68 m silicate feature to the color excess @xmath69 in molecular clouds relative to that in the diffuse ism .",
    "they note that models predict grain growth can increase the amount of extinction per hydrogen atom in the near - ir without strongly affecting the shape of the reddening curve ; note that the value of @xmath24 is calculated primarily with the @xmath70 color excess and @xmath71 color excesses ; these should follow a similar trend as the @xmath69 color excess .",
    "models of the grain coagulation in molecular clouds by show the @xmath69 per unit column density can increase relative to the diffuse ism due to coagulation until the grains start exceeding 1  @xmath68 m in size .    in this scenario ,",
    "the low @xmath0 ratio is due to grain growth in the cold , dense molecular cloud material surrounding low - mass star forming regions ; although there is some dispersion in the amount of grain growth since iras  20050 + 2720 shows a higher @xmath0 than ngc  1333 or serpens .",
    "in contrast , the extinctions and gas column densities for class  ii objects in the taurus - auriga region may have a significant component from the circumstellar disk ; grains in these disks may have grown to sizes in the mm range , too large to cause substantial reddening , thus the @xcite measurements show a larger @xmath0 ratio . alternatively , scattered light from the grains may also contribute to the colors of the objects causing an underestimate of the extinction .",
    "the rcw  108 and rcw  38 are massive star forming regions , whose members could supply sufficient radiant flux and/or mechanical power to evaporate grain mantles and break up coagulated dust in large parts of the cloud @xcite , leading to an extinction law closer to the interstellar one .    alternatively , show that the low @xmath0 ratio in @xmath1  oph , which is compatible with the value found in iras20050 + 2720 , can be described by a change in the local abundance , that is consistent with recent revisions of the local ( solar ) abundance ( see their paper for a detailed comparison of different sets of abundances ) .",
    "however , this would require a different set of abundances for each of @xmath1  oph and iras  20050 + 2720 , serpens , and ngc  1333 , while rcw  108 and rcw  38 both should have the same abundances as the galactic ism .",
    "the abundances in the stellar photosphere have not been measured to the precision required to compare the different clusters , thus this idea can not be confirmed with the available data .    in summary , the cold molecular clouds of low - mass star forming regions have @xmath0 ratios that are systematically lower than that of the diffuse ism due to their cold , dense ( @xmath72  @xmath73 ) and relatively unperturbed environments which facilitates the growth of grains .",
    "we present multi - wavelength data for the young star forming region iras  20050 + 2720 from the _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ satellites and the ground - based 2mass and iphas surveys as well as targeted flwo photometry .",
    "ysos of class  i and ii are identified based on their ir properties .",
    "x - ray sources with optical or ir counterparts that are compatible with the cluster distance are added to this sample as well as a group of x - ray sources that are identified as cluster members based on their close association with the densest cluster core .",
    "we use a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) analysis to characterize the spatial distribution of sources in iras 20050 + 2720 .",
    "overall , class  i sources are more clustered than class  ii sources , and class  ii sources are more clustered than class  iii sources .",
    "two main cluster cores can be identified in iras 20050 + 2720 .",
    "cluster core  e consists only of class  ii and iii sources , but seems younger in the @xmath7 vs. @xmath74 diagram .",
    "it is surrounded by an ir nebulosity .",
    "cluster core  w has a dense and highly extincted core in the south and a much less dense region in the north .",
    "it is not clear if those two regions are distinct groupings along overlapping lines - of - sight , or if they are part of the same physical cluster core .",
    "the age of iras 20050 + 2720 is @xmath25  myrs and it might contain populations of different ages .    in x - rays",
    "we detect preferentially the more massive ysos ; the detection fraction is higher for more evolved evolutionary stages , where the absorbing column densities are lower .",
    "still , the detected class  i objects are both hotter and more luminous than class  ii sources with similar absorption .",
    "we compare the xlf with other clusters and find an apparent correlation with cluster mass : the xlf can always be approximated by a lognormal distribution , but it seems to be steeper for clusters of lower mass .    using the combined x - ray and infrared data",
    ", we derive the @xmath0 values for the ysos in iras 20050 + 2720 .",
    "we find a value which is 60% of the value for the diffuse ism with no significant difference in this ratio between the cluster cores of iras 20050 + 2720 or between sources at different evolutionary stages . compared to values derived with other ysos",
    "the @xmath0 ratio is higher than that for the low - mass regions serpens or ngc  1333 , but much lower than that observed for class  ii objects in the taurus molecular cloud where the extinction and x - ray absorption may be dominated by circumstellar material .",
    "this could be due to modest grain growth in the molecular cloud environment that dominates the extinction toward iras 20050 + 2720 ; in contrast , the circumstellar environments may have elevated values of @xmath0 due to grain growth , gravitational settling , planet formation or dust evaporation .",
