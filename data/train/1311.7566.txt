    "let @xmath0 be a measurable space . consider a probability measure @xmath1 on @xmath0 and a symmetric measurable kernel @xmath2 , square integrable with respect to @xmath3",
    ". with @xmath4 one can associate the kernel linear operator defined by the formula @xmath5 this is a hilbert  schmidt self - adjoint operator on @xmath6 and as such it possesses a real spectrum consisting of a square summable sequence of eigenvalues . in @xcite , koltchinskii and",
    "gin investigated the problem of approximating the spectrum of @xmath7 by the spectra of certain finite dimensional random operators constructed with the help of the function @xmath4 and a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath8 , distributed according to @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , they define a sequence of random matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( above @xmath11 is the kronecker s symbol ) and show that with probability one the spectrum of @xmath12 ( completed to an infinite sequence with zeros ) converges in a certain metric to that of @xmath7 .",
    "they also show by simple examples that in general one can not replace @xmath12 with @xmath13 . moreover , under some stronger assumptions , they provide rates of convergence as well as infinite - dimensional limit theorems .    besides intrinsic mathematical interest",
    ", the original motivation in @xcite came from the limiting theory of @xmath14-statistics .",
    "a @xmath14-statistic of degree 2 , based on a kernel @xmath4 and a sequence @xmath15 is a random variable of the form @xmath16 it is well known , that under certain assumptions and proper normalization , the law of @xmath17 converges to a random variable of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 s are i.i.d .",
    "standard gaussian variables and @xmath20 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the approximate knowledge of the spectrum of @xmath7 allows for approximate sampling from the limiting spectral distribution of corresponding @xmath14-statistics . since the publication of @xcite , empirical approximations of spectra found further applications , for example , in machine learning , especially in the theory of spectral clustering on manifolds and in the kernel principal component analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the authors of @xcite do not develop specific applications , their results can be interpreted as a monte carlo method for approximating the spectrum of a kernel operator .",
    "however , such an approach would require access to an i.i.d .",
    "sample from the distribution @xmath1 , whereas for many situations of interest the density of the underlying probability measure is known only up to constants . in such situations ,",
    "random samples approximating @xmath1 can be often obtained via markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods , which rely on simulating a markov chain with a simple transition function and invariant measure @xmath1 . by the ergodic theorem , after sufficiently many steps the value of the chain will be distributed approximately as @xmath1 .",
    "there are two popular ways of using such samples with estimators .",
    "one of them is to generate sufficiently many independent samples and to plug them in the estimator .",
    "another one is to use the estimator directly on the dependent sample coming from the markov chain .",
    "while the former approach requires analysis of the stability of the estimated quantity with respect to a small perturbation of the probability measure , the latter one requires laws of large numbers in the dependent setting , which would justify using the estimator directly on the markov chain .",
    "the objective of this paper is to provide such a law of large numbers , together with some probability bounds for the problem of approximation of the spectrum of an integral operator .",
    "our motivation is manifold .",
    "first , we believe that extending the results of koltchinskii and gin to a dependent setting is an interesting probabilistic problem in its own right . at the same time , it indicates a possibility of having practical mcmc methods of estimating spectra .",
    "of course , a practical implementation of this approach would require overcoming additional obstacles related , for example , to numerical inaccuracy ; however , the law of large numbers and probabilistic bounds provide its theoretical justification .",
    "additionally , our results suggest that it should be possible to justify the validity of at least some of the aforementioned machine learning methods in a dependent case , which may more accurately model real - life situations .    as a tool",
    ", we also develop a law of large numbers for @xmath14-statistics of markov chains started from an arbitrary initial distribution , which complements results from @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : main_results ] we formulate our results , next in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we present basic notation and preliminary facts concerning markov chains ( in particular the regeneration method ) as well as tools from linear algebra which will be used in the proofs . in section",
    "[ sec : ustat ] , we prove the law of large numbers for @xmath14-statistics , and in sections  [ sec : proof_lln ] and [ sec : proof_exp ] we provide the proofs of our main results .",
    "finally , in the last section we discuss the optimality of our assumptions .",
    "we will work with a measurable space @xmath0 , where @xmath21 is a countably generated @xmath22-field .",
    "let @xmath15 be a harris ergodic markov chain with transition function @xmath23 $ ] and let @xmath1 be its unique invariant probability measure ( we refer to @xcite for the general theory of markov chains on not necessarily countable spaces ) .",
    "we will consider a symmetric measurable kernel @xmath2 and the corresponding kernel type operator @xmath7 given by ( [ eq : h_def ] ) .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath12 be random matrices given by ( [ eq : def_mth ] ) and ( [ eq : def_mh ] ) respectively",
    ".    since the infinite - dimensional operators we will consider will always be hilbert ",
    "schmidt , their spectra may be identified with an infinite sequence @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hilbert space of all square summable sequences .",
    "there is clearly some ambiguity here related to the ordering of eigenvalues , but thanks to the choice of the metric we are about to make , it will not pose a problem in the sequel , so we may disregard it .",
    "since we want to approximate the spectrum of @xmath7 by a spectrum of a finite - dimensional operator , just as in @xcite we will always identify the finite spectrum of the latter with an element of @xmath25 , by appending to it an infinite sequence of zeros .",
    "we will denote the spectrum of an operator or a matrix @xmath26 , by @xmath27",
    ".    the metric we will use to compare spectra will be the @xmath28 metric defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the set of all permutations of natural numbers .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath28 is a pseudometric on @xmath25 .    in what follows",
    ", we will always use the notation @xmath31 for a measure @xmath32 and a function  @xmath33 .",
    "our first result is the following .",
    "[ thm : lln_spectrum ] let @xmath15 be a harris ergodic markov chain on @xmath0 with invariant probability measure @xmath1 and let @xmath34 be a symmetric measurable function .",
    "assume that there exists @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the linear operator given by ( [ eq : h_def ] ) and @xmath13 , @xmath12 be defined by ( [ eq : def_mth ] ) , ( [ eq : def_mh ] ) , respectively .",
    "then for every initial measure @xmath32 of the chain @xmath40 , with probability one , @xmath41    let us now briefly comment on the hypotheses of the above theorem .",
    "our main assumption is the majorization of the form @xmath42 for some @xmath43 with @xmath36 .",
    "there are two main reasons for considering this type of assumptions .",
    "the first one is technical .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the law of large numbers for @xmath14-statistics ( which we will use in the proofs ) of mixing sequences may fail if one assumes just integrability of the kernel , which intuitively is related to the fact that the behaviour of the random variable @xmath44 may depend on the behaviour of @xmath4 on @xmath45-negligible sets ( since @xmath46 are dependent ) . as we will see in section  [ sec : examples ] , in our setting a similar phenomenon occurs , in particular the law of large numbers for the spectra may fail if one assumes only that @xmath47 .",
    "the second reason is the fact that in the theory of markov chains , one often proves ergodicity by means of drift conditions and pointwise assumptions related to the drift functions @xmath48 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the drift conditions are expressed only in terms of the drift function and the transition function @xmath49 . while it is not always easy to check integrability of a general function with respect to the stationary measure , the drift criteria provide certain integrability for the drift function .",
    "thus , one can often construct the majorant @xmath50 in terms of the function @xmath51 .",
    "let us also stress that we require that the inequality between @xmath4 and @xmath50 hold pointwise and not just @xmath45 a.s .",
    "again , the reason is related to the dependencies between the variables @xmath52 . from the point of the mcmc applications ,",
    "it is crucial to allow the markov chain to start from arbitrary initial conditions and the distribution of the chain approaches the stationary measure only in the limit . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not enough to assume a @xmath45-a.s . bound . in section  [ sec : examples ] , we will illustrate these remarks with examples .    finally , let us note that the above theorem provides convergence of spectra also for the random operator @xmath13 , which as we have mentioned and as was noted in @xcite is not the case in general , even in the i.i.d . setting . to see this ,",
    "it is enough to choose a function @xmath4 vanishing everywhere on @xmath53 except for the diagonal , for absolutely continuous @xmath1 and such that @xmath54 .",
    "the validity of the law of large numbers for the spectrum of @xmath13 in our case is of course again a consequence of our assumptions on @xmath4 and @xmath50 , which preclude such counterexamples .",
    "let us now pass to our second result , which is a tail inequality for the approximation of spectra .",
    "for this , we will work in a more restrictive , analytic framework , we will also impose stronger ergodicity assumptions on the chain .",
    "recall that a harris ergodic markov chain with transition function @xmath49 and invariant measure @xmath1 , is geometrically ergodic if there exists @xmath55 such that for every @xmath56 and some constant @xmath57 , we have for every @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total - variation distance and @xmath61 is the @xmath62-step transition function of the chain .",
    "[ thm : exponential_ineq ] let @xmath1 be a probability measure on @xmath0 , where @xmath63 is a metric space and @xmath21 the borel @xmath22-field .",
    "let @xmath64 be a bounded function and @xmath7 the corresponding kernel operator defined by ( [ eq : h_def ] ) .",
    "assume that there exist continuous functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) which form an orthonormal system in @xmath6 and a sequence of non - negative numbers @xmath69 such that we have a point - wise equality @xmath70 with the series converging absolutely and almost uniformly on @xmath53 .",
    "assume furthermore that @xmath15 is a geometrically ergodic markov chain with invariant measure @xmath1 , started at a point @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 where the constant @xmath73 depends only on the transition function @xmath49 and the starting point @xmath71 .    in the above formulation",
    ", we do not specify the dependence of the constants in the inequality on the parameters of the markov chain .",
    "this will be done in section  [ sec : proof_exp ] via drift conditions .",
    "we state theorem  [ thm : exponential_ineq ] for chains started from a point .",
    "in fact , it holds also for chains started from more general measures @xmath32 satisfying some mild conditions .",
    "since to formulate this condition we would need to introduce the regeneration technique for markov chains , such a formulation is deferred to remark  [ re : starting_measure ] in section  [ sec : proof_exp ] .",
    "we remark that the assumptions concerning the function @xmath4 are satisfied for continuous positive definite kernels on a large class of topological spaces . in the case of compact spaces",
    "this fact is known as mercer s theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since there are many generalizations of this result , with subtle differences , and a discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this article we prefer to formulate the theorem in an abstract form .",
    "we remark that similar inequalities in the i.i.d .",
    "case were considered , for example , in @xcite under weaker assumptions than the boundedness of @xmath4 ( instead some exponential integrability was assumed ) . however , those estimates consider a weaker metric between spectra and , when specialized to the case of bounded kernels , involve additional logarithmic factors .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thm : exponential_ineq ] ( in a version for chains started not necessarily from a point ) improves on their result for bounded kernels even in the i.i.d . case .",
    "let us also mention that in our case one can also obtain results for unbounded kernels , under appropriate drift conditions involving the function @xmath4 ( using , e.g. , results from @xcite ) . however , their formulation would be much more involved , so we restrict to the special case of uniformly bounded kernels .",
    "we would like to stress the important role of positive definiteness in theorem  [ thm : exponential_ineq ] . as will be shown in the proof ,",
    "thanks to this assumption we can replace the operator @xmath13 by a sum of the form @xmath74 for some @xmath75 which is an @xmath6-valued additive functional of the markov chain @xmath40 ( similar ideas in the i.i.d .",
    "case were used , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "this allows to apply the regeneration technique for obtaining concentration inequalities for additive functionals of markov chains .",
    "we will now present basic facts related to the regeneration technique for markov chains on general state spaces .",
    "this technique was independently discovered by nummelin @xcite and athreya ",
    "ney @xcite and relies on a decomposition of the trajectory of a markov chain into one - dependent paths of random length . instead of providing the technical details of the construction",
    ", we will just present its properties , which will be used in the proof .",
    "the technical details can be found in many monographs on markov chains ; we recommend @xcite .",
    "let thus @xmath0 be a state space , with @xmath21 countably generated and assume that @xmath49 is a markov chain transition function on @xmath63 .",
    "assume also that the corresponding markov chain @xmath76 is harris ergodic .",
    "then there exists a set @xmath77 with @xmath78 , a positive integer @xmath79 , @xmath80 and a probability measure @xmath81 on @xmath0 , such that for all @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84    using the set @xmath85 for any probability measure @xmath32 one can define two sequences of random variables @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( on some probability space ) with the following properties :    * @xmath86 is a markov chain , @xmath88 . *",
    "@xmath89 . * the stopping times @xmath90 , @xmath91 are almost surely finite .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 are independent random variables , whereas @xmath93 are i.i.d .",
    "and their distribution depends only on @xmath49 ( and not on @xmath32 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath94 . * the blocks @xmath95",
    "form a one - dependent stationary sequence of random variables with values in @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( i.e. , for all @xmath99 , the @xmath22-fields @xmath100 and @xmath101 are independent ) .",
    "* for any @xmath102 and all @xmath99 , @xmath103    as already mentioned , in the proofs we will use only the above properties and so we do not present the general construction of the chain @xmath86 .",
    "let us however briefly describe the intuition hidden behind it in the special case of @xmath104 .",
    "informally , if one attempts to generate the chain then one draws @xmath105 according to the measure @xmath32 , and next if at step @xmath62 one has @xmath106 , then for @xmath107 , the next variable @xmath108 is drawn from the distribution @xmath109 and one sets @xmath110 . if @xmath111 then one tosses a coin with heads probability equal to @xmath112 .",
    "if one gets heads , then @xmath113 is generated according to @xmath81 and @xmath114 is set to one , otherwise @xmath114 is set to zero and @xmath113 is generated according to the probability measure @xmath115 it is straightforward but slightly tedious to formalize this intuition and prove that for harris ergodic chains it gives properties ( a0)(a4 ) . for general @xmath79 , one can still repeat this construction for the @xmath79-step transition function to define the chain @xmath116 and then fill in the intermediate variables in such a way that properties ( a0)(a4 ) are still satisfied ( note that for @xmath117 the blocks @xmath118 of property ( a3 ) are in fact independent , which is not necessarily the case for general @xmath79 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the details .",
    "since the markov chain @xmath8 , started from @xmath32 has the same distribution as @xmath86 above , to prove a limit theorem for @xmath8 it is enough to do it for @xmath119 for which one can exploit the additional structure given by the auxiliary variables @xmath120 , which often allows to reduce the proof to the corresponding limit theorem in the one - dependent or independent case .",
    "this strategy has been adopted for many problems , including the law of large numbers , the central limit theorem or the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "we again refer to @xcite for a detailed exposition . as a consequence , for the purpose of proving limit theorems",
    ", we can identify the sequences @xmath8 and @xmath86 . in",
    "what follows , we will adopt this convention ( in particular we will drop the tilde in @xmath121 ) .    in the proofs",
    ", we will use the strong law of large numbers for markov chains , which can be easily proved using the regeneration method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm : lln_mc ] let @xmath15 be a harris ergodic markov chain on @xmath0 , with invariant probability measure @xmath1 and let @xmath122 be a @xmath123-integrable function . then with probability one , as @xmath124 , @xmath125      the main linear - algebraic result we will need is the hoffman  wielandt inequality . to prove the law of large numbers , it will be sufficient to use its original finite - dimensional version .",
    "however , for the exponential inequality we will use the infinite - dimensional version proved in @xcite .    [ thm : hw ] if @xmath126 are normal hilbert ",
    "schmidt operators on some hilbert space , then @xmath127",
    "recall the notation ( [ eq : def_ustat ] ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove the following .",
    "[ prop : ustat ] let @xmath15 be a harris ergodic markov chain on @xmath0 with invariant probability measure @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be a symmetric measurable function .",
    "assume that there exists a @xmath123-integrable @xmath128 , such that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "then for every initial probability @xmath32 of the chain @xmath40 , with probability one , @xmath129 as @xmath130 .",
    "we remark that in the literature there are several results concerning laws of large numbers for @xmath14-statistics under dependence . in @xcite ,",
    "such a result is obtained for a class of ergodic stationary sequences , under assumption of the same nature as ours .",
    "however , we need the above version , since for mcmc applications it is important to consider markov chains started from a point ( as the very purpose of mcmc algorithms is to simulate the stationary distribution , which is not directly accessible ) . results of this type have been obtained recently , for example , in @xcite ; however , they require higher order ergodicity of the chain .",
    "we would like to add that the results in @xcite are not expressed in terms of point - wise bounds on the kernel @xmath4 but rather in terms of integrability of certain functionals on the paths of the markov chains .",
    "thus , in general they are not comparable to proposition  [ prop : ustat ] . on the one hand they may be applicable to kernels which are not bounded by tensor products ,",
    "on the other hand the verification of assumptions may be more difficult .    to prove proposition  [ prop : ustat ] , we will use the following result which is a simple corollary to theorem  5.2 . in @xcite ( we remark that this theorem is stated for @xmath131 , but it is easy to see that its proof works for an arbitrary measurable space ) .

    ", we have @xmath161 where we again used ( a4 ) .    thus , using ( a3 ) and ( [ eq : ratio_of_ns ] )",
    "we get by the marcinkiewicz law of large numbers that @xmath162 a.s .",

    "this shows that indeed @xmath163 a.s . and ends the proof of proposition  [ prop : ustat ] .",
    "to prove theorem  [ thm : lln_spectrum ] , we will need one more simple result , namely a marcinkiewicz  zygmund - type law of large numbers for markov chains .",
    "its proof is a standard application of the regeneration technique . since we have not been able to find it in the literature , we provide it for completeness .",
