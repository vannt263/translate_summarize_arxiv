    "the widespread occurrence of anomalously slow diffusion and transport @xcite in biological cells is still not commonly appreciated in spite of a growing experimental evidence and support @xcite .",
    "one of the main psychological obstacles on the way to a wider recognition is that ultra - slowness seems intuitively be rather obstructive for the corresponding diffusion - limited biochemical reactions , especially if it is caused by divergent mean residence times ( mrts ) in trapping domains @xcite created by random meshwork of cell s cytoskeleton . from this perspective , the occurrence of subdiffusion might be more associated with physics of dying , rather than with physics of life .",
    "moreover , the bulk of experimental biophysical data is traditionally interpreted in terms of normal diffusion and even modern biophysics textbooks ( see e.g. @xcite ) discuss only normal diffusion , despite appreciating the fact of existence and importance of intracellular molecular crowding which clearly obstructs diffusion via increase of the effective medium s viscosity @xcite .",
    "the increase of effective viscosity depends also on the size of diffusing particles .",
    "so , _  for molecules smaller than 1 nm , it s similar to that of water ; for particles of diameter 6 nm ( such as a protein of mass @xmath7 g / mol ) , it s about 3 times that of water . for 50 - 500 nm particles , it s 30 - 300 times that of water \" _",
    "@xcite ( p. 571 ) . in this respect ,",
    "typical globular proteins are in the range of 2 - 20 nm ( diameter ) @xcite and mrna molecules are about 400 - 800 nm in diameter @xcite",
    ". however , the traditional thinking and prejudges can also be the reasons for overlooking anomalous diffusion and transport regimes ( probably mostly transient ) as recent experimental work uncovers @xcite .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of subdiffusion clearly depends not only on the size of single macromolecules , but also on their concentration , i.e. on the degree of molecular crowding @xcite .",
    "one of approaches to anomalously slow diffusion and transport is traditionally based on the assumption of divergent mrts in trapping domains @xcite .",
    "of course , mrt @xmath8 in any finite spatial domain with linear size @xmath9 can never diverge in real life .",
    "however , it can largely exceed a characteristic diffusion time , @xmath10 , required to subdiffusionally explore on average , @xmath11 with @xmath6 , a _ finite _ volume with linear size @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the corresponding subdiffusion coefficient measured in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "then , the approximation of infinite mrts becomes physically justified on the relevant mesoscopic scale @xmath15 .",
    "for very large times @xmath16 , the diffusion becomes normal , @xmath17 .",
    "however , the corresponding spatial scale can largely exceed @xmath15 and therefore the normal diffusion ( and transport ) regime can become of a little importance for certain processes in mesoscopic biochemical reactors of living cells , such as e. g. passive transport of mrna macromolecules or large globular proteins @xcite , and in turn subdiffusion becomes of profound importance for such processes on mesoscopic scale .",
    "the approximation of divergent mrts features the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) approach to subdiffusion @xcite . in this case , the position increments can be totally independent . within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the ctrw transport is congruent @xcite with jump - like transport in random potentials .",
    "moreover , the overdamped continuous space markovian langevin dynamics in spatially varying potentials can be contracted onto such a semi - markovian ctrw by doing properly spatial coarse - graining @xcite . then , a potential energy disorder can result in anomalous diffusion and transport in agreement with the semi - markovian ctrw theory as recent work nicely demonstrates @xcite ( see also paper by lindenberg _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in this special issue ) .    alternatively",
    ", subdiffusion can result from the medium s viscoelasticity @xcite .",
    "it can be either due to viscoelasticity of the polymer actin meshwork @xcite , or due to macromolecular crowding in complex fluids @xcite as e.g. in cytoplasm of bacterial cells which are lacking static cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "statistical analysis of the experimental single particle diffusional trajectories in bacteria @xcite reveals in fact the primarily viscoelastic origin of subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "a main result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the fractional brownian motion scenario ( see below ) is more likely than one based on a semi - markovian ctrw @xcite .",
    "the authors of experimental work @xcite came also to a similar conclusion . within this alternative subdiffusional scenario",
    "all the moments of random time spent in finite spatial domains remain finite .",
    "the corresponding mrt is not only finite but it scales down to zero with @xmath18 .",
    "the physical reason for subdiffusion here is very different .",
    "it occurs due to long - time anticorrelations in the position increments @xcite . considering brownian particle of radius @xmath19 , which starts to move at @xmath20 with velocity @xmath21 ( we consider a one - dimensional case for simplicity )",
    ", one expects it to experience a viscoelastic force @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a frictional memory kernel whose laplace - transform @xmath24 is related to the frequency - dependent medium s viscosity @xmath25 as @xmath26 . in the case of purely viscous fluids , and in neglecting the hydrodynamic memory effects , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fluid s macroscopic viscosity , so that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the stokes viscous friction coefficient",
    ". for weakly viscoelastic fluids , @xmath31 , exponentially decays in time with rate @xmath32 , and correspondingly @xmath33 , where @xmath34 has dimension of a linear elastic force constant .",
    "this corresponds to the maxwell theory of viscoelasticity @xcite who derived the phenomenon of viscosity from medium s elasticity by assuming that the linear elastic force , @xmath35 $ ] , acting on the particle can relax in time with rate @xmath32 , yielding a viscoelastic force , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , if the force relaxation is very fast with respect to the change of particle s velocity , then @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , whereas in the opposite limit , @xmath39 $ ] . for strongly viscoelastic media",
    "one expects that @xmath23 decays in time much slower than exponential and a power law decay @xmath40 can serve as a better model .",
    "for a fluid - like environment the effective macroscopic viscosity @xmath41 should remain , however , finite .",
    "it can be very large , but yet finite .",
    "therefore , a long - time cutoff to the power - law must exist . in 1936 ,",
    "a. gemant proposed a class of power - law viscoelastic models which are consistent with this demand @xcite .",
    "its particular representative corresponds in the laplace space to @xmath42 in our notations . here , @xmath43 is an effective asymptotic friction coefficient and @xmath1 presents a long - time memory cutoff .",
    "the corresponding memory kernel is approximately @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the familiar gamma - function . for @xmath48 , @xmath23 decays also in accordance with a power law , @xmath49 , i.e. elastic correlations are still rather strong .",
    "however , the corresponding integral converges ensuring that the asymptotic friction coefficient @xmath50 is finite . in the limit of infinitely large medium s viscosity yielding @xmath51 , and infinitely long memory range , @xmath52 , with @xmath46 kept constant , eq .",
    "( [ gemant ] ) becomes exact , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 where the last equality defines fractional caputo derivative of the order @xmath6 @xcite acting on @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 can be named the fractional friction coefficient .",
    "clearly , eqs .",
    "( [ gemant],[fract1 ] ) can serve as a good approximation only for the times @xmath45 . in the focus of this letter",
    "is but the entire time evolution , interpolating between transient subdiffusion and asymptotically normal diffusion behavior .",
    "for example , @xmath1 can correspond to the time scale of seconds or minutes , and then subdiffusion emerges on the time scale from microseconds to seconds or minutes , as in biological cells @xcite .",
    "we continue with a non - markovian generalized langevin equation ( gle ) description @xcite for an overdamped brownian particle neglecting inertial effects .",
    "then , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a generally nonlinear force acting on the particle and @xmath59 is a thermal random force of the environment .",
    "it is gaussian , unbiased on average , and obeying the fluctuation - dissipation relation , @xmath60 at the environmental temperature @xmath61 .",
    "this is required for the consistency with thermodynamics at thermal equilibrium . in the above - mentioned limit @xmath52 , @xmath51 , @xmath62 , gle ( [ gle ] )",
    "is named also the fractional langevin equation @xcite upon the use of the corresponding abbreviation ( [ fract1 ] ) for its lhs . in this limit , @xmath59 is nothing else but the fractional gaussian noise by mandelbrot and van ness @xcite which presents an instance of @xmath63 noise with the spectral power density @xmath64 .",
    "notice that generally the lower integration limit in eq .",
    "( [ gle ] ) is @xmath65 .",
    "it can be replaced , however , with @xmath20 since we assume that the particle starts to move at this time being initially localized , i.e. @xmath66 for @xmath67 .    ) versus time ( in units of @xmath1 ) under the influence of constant force @xmath0 for several different values of @xmath68 and the same @xmath50 , @xmath1 .",
    "the limit of normal diffusion is achieved asymptotically from above .",
    "transiently subdiffusing particles always cover larger distances than normally diffusing particles with the same asymptotic frictional force constant @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    let us consider the transport under the influence of constant force @xmath0 .",
    "then , the above gle can be easily solved formally using the laplace - transform method , for any memory kernel @xmath23 . transforming back to the time domain for the memory kernel ( [ gemant1 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains for the averaged mean displacement the simple result , @xmath69 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this exact solution is compared in fig.[fig1 ] with the solution of the ordinary langevin equation with memoryless friction for the particle which experiences the same frictional force for the whole time span as our particle asymptotically , or , said differently , the result of the markovian approximation to the considered dynamics . clearly , for all times our particle moves in fact faster , covering larger distances and approaching gradually the limit of normal diffusion from above .",
    "the instant time - dependent ensemble - averaged velocity @xmath70 $ ] is also always larger than its asymptotic value @xmath71 ( a spurious singularity at @xmath72 can be eliminated , if to take the initial inertial effects into account ) .",
    "mathematically , this is simply because @xmath73 , for @xmath74 and @xmath6 .",
    "the physics is also clear . in the limit @xmath75 the normally diffusing particle",
    "is get localized , @xmath76 , whereas our particle still moves , but ultra slow ( per definition ) since @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the `` ultra - slow '' moving particle can cover larger distances .",
    "furthermore , for any memory kernel in the studied model and for arbitrary constant @xmath0 the variance of the particle position , @xmath78 obeys @xcite @xmath79 and therefore it follows to the same pattern as in eq .",
    "( [ solution1 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath80 here , @xmath13 is fractional diffusion coefficient related to temperature and fractional friction coefficient by the generalized einstein - stokes relation , @xmath81 , which contains the standard one , @xmath82 , as a particular case .",
    "we suppose that our observation is rather general .",
    "for example , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite seem to agree with our line of reasoning .",
    "indeed , mrna macromolecules have in the related experiments radii in the range of 200 - 500 nm . furthermore , the normal diffusion coefficient in water was found to be @xmath83 ( see supplementary material in @xcite ) . from this , given the water viscosity @xmath84 pa@xmath85sec , one can estimate the corresponding radius as @xmath86 which gives @xmath87 nm for @xmath88 k. let us assume that @xmath89 nm .",
    "then , the corresponding macroscopic normal diffusion coefficient in cytosol should be by the factor of @xmath90 smaller than one in water @xcite ( see the above quotation in introduction ) .",
    "this yields @xmath91 .",
    "however , the experiment yields not normal but subdiffusion with @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) in @xcite ) and @xmath13 in the range from @xmath93 to @xmath94 @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath96 for this value of @xmath19 ( smaller particles in experiment should also subdiffuse faster ) one can conclude that subdiffusion can indeed cover larger distances than normal diffusion with @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , one can estimate the transition time @xmath1 .",
    "given the relation @xmath98 which follows within our model one obtains for it @xmath99 sec .",
    "this is a rather reasonable estimate since subdiffusion regime lasts in those experiments up to 30 sec , cf .",
    "2(a ) in @xcite .",
    "the discussed phenomenon might seem paradoxical , even though its explanation is almost trivial .",
    "nevertheless , it has profound implications for subdiffusion in biological cells .",
    "first of all , the occurrence of subdiffusion on some transient time scale @xmath1 and the corresponding mesoscopic spatial scale @xmath100 does not contradict to the bulk of macroscopic experimental data indicating typically a normal diffusion @xcite .",
    "even more important , the overall transport is in fact faster than its long time normal asymptotics that results from a drastic reduction of the effective normal diffusion coefficient for large macromolecules due to molecular crowding effects in cytosol .",
    "very important is also the fact that on the time scale @xmath101 , by use of the memory kernel ( [ fract1 ] ) as approximation , the resulting random process is nothing else the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite .",
    "the fractal dimensionality of the fbm trajectories is known to be @xmath102 @xcite , i.e. @xmath103 for the normal brownian motion . however , for @xmath104 and for 3d euclidean embedding dimension it becomes @xmath105 ( a fractal trajectory can not have larger hausdorff dimension that the euclidean space in which it is living ) .",
    "this means that a subdiffusionally searching particle explores much more thoroughly finite volumes than a normally diffusing particle on the same spatial and time scales .",
    "therefore , transient subdiffusion can provide only advantages for the diffusion - limited reactions in tiny biochemical reactors of living cells , which are densely stuffed with different macromolecules , without some principal drawbacks .",
    "this is rather unexpected and paradoxical conclusion .",
