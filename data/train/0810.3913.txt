    "where the symmetry is broken during instant preheating we have summarised the constraints found in a previous paper for completeness @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all of the models require some fine tuning to be effective .",
    "we can understand this by considering how the total power spectrum is generated . from ( [ pzetasplit ] ) the first term , coming from the inflationary adiabatic perturbations",
    "are always given by ( [ ip : pzetainf ] ) and @xmath195 .",
    "hence the primordial power spectrum is boosted by a factor @xmath196 relative to the inflaton field perturbations .",
    "if primordial density perturbations due to isocurvature field perturbations are to dominate , then their effect on the expansion history must be boosted by a larger factor .",
    "in contrast with the inflaton , the amplitude of the density perturbations resulting from orthogonal perturbations is dependent upon the physics after inflation . in order for the inflationary isocurvature perturbations to generate the dominant part of the primordial curvature perturbation we require",
    "@xmath197 it turns out to be hard to satisfy this condition except by fine tuning the parameters .",
    "we also need to choose parameters that lead to efficient preheating , ( [ ip : ratio ] ) , which often means that the coupling must be strong , @xmath85 and that the mass of the @xmath38 particles must be small at the time of their creation .",
    "finally there is also the observational constraint that the non - gaussianity must not be too large .",
    "the parameter constraints are approximately that for the nearly symmetric potential we required @xmath198 and strong coupling , @xmath85 ; for the strongly broken potential we require the mass hierarchy @xmath199 and an even stronger coupling , @xmath200 ; and for the non - symmetric reheating model we require a large ratio of the coupling constants @xmath201 .",
    "perhaps more serious than the constraints on the parameters are that for each model we require fine tuning of the initial conditions so that the background trajectory lies very close to one of the axes , i.e.  we require that the initial value of one of the two inflaton fields @xmath4 is very small .",
    "unless the broken symmetry of the models can play a role in creating these initial conditions the fine tuning is unattractive .",
    "the size of the isocurvature perturbations in each model is given by @xmath202 , independent of the background trajectory .",
    "it is only when the background trajectory lies very close to @xmath203 that these small perturbations correspond to a significant perturbation in the value of @xmath12 , i.e.  it is only for very small @xmath12 that @xmath204 is non - negligible .",
    "this is what we require in order to satisfy the inequality ( [ ip : nchi ] ) for all of the models we have considered .",
    "however we can not have a too small value of @xmath12 because if @xmath205 then the non - gaussianity is very large and this is ruled out by observations , see the comment after ( [ ip : phi2minma ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fine tuning of the initial trajectory to be close to one of the inflaton fields axes is also required in several other models in order for them to generate a large non - gaussianity .",
    "examples include an inhomogeneous end of inflation @xcite and during multiple - field slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "ultimately , observational data will determine whether the primordial density perturbation has a significant deviation from scale - invariance , @xmath206 , as predicted by adiabatic fluctuations in the inflaton field driving chaotic inflation .",
    "an equally important observable is the amplitude of the primordial gravitational wave background that is predicted .",
    "the amplitude of gravitational waves is determined directly by the energy scale during inflation and is given by @xcite @xmath207    adopting the cobe normalisation for @xmath208 , the primordial tensor - scalar ratio is given by @xmath209 hence we see that the tensor - scalar ratio is reduced if @xmath210 . thus if isocurvature field fluctuations contribute significantly to the primordial density perturbation the gravitational wave background is much smaller than if the density perturbations are due solely to inflaton perturbations @xcite . if the isocurvature perturbations have no effect towards generating the primordial curvature perturbation then @xmath211 .",
    "if @xmath212 is this large then the tensor background should be detected with the planck experiment @xcite .",
    "if the primordial curvature perturbation is generated from the inflationary isocurvature perturbation then the spectral index depends on the model of inflation , but in each case it is closer to scale invariance than the curvature perturbations during inflation .",
    "the model with a non - symmetric potential has the largest deviation from scale invariance , as given by ( [ ip : tiltma ] ) , while the nearly symmetric potential is very close to scale invariance ( [ nzetako ] ) , which for the allowed parameter range satisfies @xmath213 .",
    "the model with a symmetric potential is closest of all to scale invariance , shown by ( [ nzetasymm ] ) , with the tilt being second order in slow - roll parameters @xmath214 .",
    "observationally this model is therefore likely to be indistinguishable from a harrison - zeldovich spectrum , @xmath215 .",
    "this is mildly disfavoured by observations @xcite .    for each model",
    "we have also calculated the non - gaussianity , specifically the bispectrum parameterised by @xmath101 . only in the model with a non - symmetric potential",
    "is @xmath216 for a significant range of the viable parameter range , see fig .",
    "[ fig : matsuda ] . in this model",
    "@xmath217 so if the hint of a detection of @xmath218 @xcite is confirmed then this model will be ruled out . for the model with a nearly symmetric potential @xmath219 for the entire parameter range , while for the model with non symmetric preheating it is possible but not preferred to have @xmath220 .",
    "if instant preheating is completely efficient then the inflaton field will completely decay into @xmath38 particles around the first time @xmath39 reaches its minimum after inflation ends and all isocurvature perturbations will be washed out .",
    "however if the process is less efficient then it is possible that a residual fraction of isocurvature perturbations will survive until today .",
    "the amount will depend on the subsequent reheating processes , but in the limit that the primordial curvature perturbation is entirely generated from the inflationary isocurvature perturbations then the primordial curvature and isocurvature perturbations will be totally correlated .",
    "constraints on the fraction of isocurvature perturbations in the cmb are given in @xcite .",
    "however if there is an isocurvature perturbation present after preheating then it may affect the subsequent evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation , which is otherwise conserved on large scales @xcite .",
