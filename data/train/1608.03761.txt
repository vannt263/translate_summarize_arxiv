    "the perovskite ( @xmath10o@xmath1 ) family of materials has been paid considerable attention both in experimental and theoretical studies due to their flexible and coupled compositional , structural , electrical and magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "such flexibility arises from the structural building blocks  the corner - connected @xmath0o@xmath6 octahedra , where @xmath0 is usually a transition metal .",
    "typical structural variations from the cubic structure include rotation and tilting of the octahedra  @xcite , off - centering of the @xmath11 and/or @xmath0 cations ( pseudo jahn - teller effect )  @xcite , and expansion / contraction of the @xmath0o@xmath6 octahedral cages  @xcite . while the first two distortions are ubiquitous , the cooperative octahedral breathing distortion is rather rare in perovskites with a single @xmath0 cation composition .",
    "such breathing distortion , resulting from the alternation of elongation and contraction of the @xmath0-o bonds between neighboring @xmath0o@xmath6 cages , is usually concomitant with the charge ordering of the @xmath0 cations and a corresponding metal - insulator transition .",
    "cafeo@xmath1 is a typical perovskite material exhibiting such charge ordering transition  @xcite . at room temperature ,",
    "the strong covalency in the fe @xmath12 - o 2@xmath13 interaction leads to a @xmath14 band and electron delocalization which gives rise to metallic conductivity in cafeo@xmath1 . near 290  k ,",
    "a second - order metal - insulator transition ( mit ) occurs which reduces the conductivity dramatically  @xcite .",
    "the mssbauer spectrum of low temperature cafeo@xmath1 has revealed the presence of two chemically distinct fe sites ( with different hyperfine fields ) present in equal proportion  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the fe cations undergo charge disproportionation 2fe@xmath2@xmath3fe@xmath4+fe@xmath5 below the transition temperature .",
    "the origin of the charge ordering transition is usually attributed to mott insulator physics , where the carriers are localized by strong electron - lattice interactions  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been debated whether the difference in charge state resides on the @xmath0 cations or as holes in the oxygen @xmath15 orbitals  @xcite , and several computational studies showed that the magnetic configuration , in addition to structural changes , plays a vital role in stabilizing the charge ordered state in cafeo@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude of the cooperative breathing mode is a key indicator of the magnitude of electron trapping and band gap opening in mit .",
    "conversely because the mit is sensitive to lattice distortion , structural manipulation such as cation doping and epitaxial strain can be exploited to control the electrical properties of this family of oxide systems .    in this study , we examine the structural and electrical properties in @xmath0-cation doped cafeo@xmath1 with density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "various dopant cations , concentrations , and arrangements have been tested .",
    "dopants of different sizes are tested , and alignments of pairs of dopants along different crystallographic planes are examined . to confirm the presence of charge ordering in ( 111 ) doped cafeo@xmath1 , we also carried out rigorous oxidation state calculations for fe cations in different octahedral cages based on their wave function topologies  @xcite . through examination of these model systems ,",
    "we assess the extent to which the structure - coupled electronic transition in doped oxide materials like cafeo@xmath1 can be influenced via doping to enhance band gap tunability , which in turn controls the mit temperature .",
    "our dft calculations are performed using the norm - conserving nonlocal pseudopotential plane - wave method  @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotentials  @xcite are generated by the opium package  @xcite with a 50  ry plane - wave energy cutoff .",
    "calculations are performed with the quantum - espresso package  @xcite using the local density approximation  @xcite with the rotationally invariant effective hubbard @xmath16 correction  @xcite of 4  ev on the fe @xmath17 orbitals  @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional . in case of ni and ce doping",
    ", we applied @xmath16 = 4.6  ev  @xcite and @xmath16 = 5  ev  @xcite for ni @xmath17 and ce @xmath18 , respectively .",

    "different spin orderings for pure cafeo@xmath1 are tested to find the magnetic ground state , and subsequent solid solution calculations all start with that magnetic ground state .",
    "to identify the correct spin ordering in pure cafeo@xmath1 , we performed relaxations on both high temperature metallic orthorhombic @xmath24  @xcite and low temperature semiconducting monoclinic @xmath25  @xcite structures with common magnetic orderings commensurate with the @xmath26 supercells , as shown in fig .",

    "[ tab : cfo ] , we can see that both high temperature and low temperature ferromagnetic cafeo@xmath1 relax to the ferromagnetic ground states .",
    "note that an additional magnetic phase transition is experimentally observed for cafeo@xmath1 at 15  k , where it adopts an incommensurate magnetic structure with a modulation vector [ @xmath35 , 0 , @xmath35 ] ( @xmath37 , and reciprocal lattice vectors as basis )  @xcite .",
    "since dft calculates 0  k internal energy , the ferromagnetic ground state represents a reasonable approximation of the spin - spin interactions within a unit cell given the relatively long spin wave length and low experimental crossover temperature to fm .",
    "the volumes of the two feo@xmath6 cages are equivalent in the high temperature metallic phase , as expected .",
    "the low temperature ground state has a cage size difference @xmath38@xmath33 , indicating some degree of charge ordering .",
    "however , the projected density of states ( pdos ) of the @xmath25 ground state cafeo@xmath1 in fig .  [ fig : pdos]a shows that although there are separate gaps in each spin channel , the valence band edge in the majority spin touches the conduction band edge in the minority spin , resulting in zero total gap .",
    "the absence of band gap and the weak charge ordering is a result of the underestimation of band gaps in dft  @xcite due to its unphysical electron delocalization , this result is common in mott insulators with partially filled @xmath17 orbitals and is in agreement with another dft study of cafeo@xmath1  @xcite . even though dft does not predict the correct electronic ground state of cafeo@xmath1 , it is however indicative of the sensitive nature of the cafeo@xmath1 band gap as it can be easily influenced when fe @xmath17 orbital filling is varied by structural or other perturbations .",
    "moreover , the different @xmath39 between high temperature and low temperature of feo@xmath6 ground state suggests that the structural aspect of the mit can be modeled reasonably well by dft .",
    "( left ) and ( b ) cazro@xmath1 . ]    for comparison , we calculated the pdos of cazro@xmath1 relaxed from experimental @xmath40 structure  @xcite , shown also in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos]b .",
    "because zr@xmath2 has empty @xmath41 orbitals , the fraction of zr @xmath17 states in the valence band is negligible compared to o @xmath13 states , and a wide charge - transfer gap of 3.82  ev occurs .",
    "since we expect to exploit the size effect of the dopants like zr to influence the electronic property of cafeo@xmath1 , we expect that the nature of fe spin - spin interaction is not greatly affected by doping .",
    "therefore in the following study we continue to use fm as the starting magnetic configuration for relaxations of the doped materials .      to test how zr doping influences the structural and electrical properties of cafeo@xmath1 , we performed relaxations and subsequent band gap calculations of cafeo@xmath1-cazro@xmath1 solid solutions .",
    "we employ a @xmath26 super cell and explore all possible @xmath0-site cation combinations .",
    "all the solid solutions tested turn out to be metallic except one , which has a gap of 0.93  ev .",
    "the insulating solid solution has a cation arrangement with four zr cations on the ( 001 ) plane , making it a layered structure along [ 001 ] .",
    "interestingly , instead of a breathing - mode charge disproportionation , this structure has a 2d jahn - teller type distortion , and all four fe cations are in the same chemical environment .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jt ] , the fe - o bond lengths in the @xmath7 plane are 2.16     and 1.83     in each feo@xmath6 , with the orientation alternating between neighbors .",
    "the shorter fe - o bond length is essentially the same as that in high temperature cafeo@xmath1 .",
    "the consequence of the addition of larger zr@xmath2 cations ( @xmath42   ) compared to fe@xmath2 ( @xmath43   ) is that when zr cations occupy an entire ( 001 ) plane the in - plane lattice is expanded from 3.70    to 3.88   , elongating the fe - o bonds and enabling the 2d jahn - teller type distortion .",
    "zr@xmath44)o@xmath1 and ( b ) top view of the zro@xmath45 layer showing the 2d jahn - teller type distortion . ]    from the pdos of the solid solution in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfzo_pdos]a we can see that like pure cafeo@xmath1 both the valence and the conduction edges are of fe @xmath46 and o @xmath15 characters , with virtually no zr contribution . in charge ordering mit , the delocalized electrons on fe@xmath2 transfer to neighboring fe@xmath2 , making fe@xmath5/fe@xmath4 pairs with the valence and conduction bands located on different cations , concomitant with feo@xmath6 cage size changes .",
    "the band gap in case of charge ordering therefore depends on the energy difference between the @xmath12 orbitals in fe@xmath5 and fe@xmath4 , which in turn is affected by the crystal field splitting energy caused by the oxygen ligands . on the other hand , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfzo_pdos]b , the solid solution band gap is caused by the removal of degeneracy in the @xmath12 orbitals and is controlled by the difference in energy between the two @xmath12 orbitals on the same fe@xmath2 cation .",
    "since the @xmath12 gap splitting is a result of the fe - o bond length difference , it is easier to tune by applying either chemical pressure or biaxial strain to change the in - plane lattice constant , whereas the charge ordering mechanism requires the control of individual feo@xmath6 octahedral sizes to change the relative energy of @xmath12 orbitals between two fe sites .",
    "nevertheless , this cafeo@xmath1-cazro@xmath1 solid solution demonstrates that when arranged in a particular way , in this case on ( 001 ) plane , the size effect of the large zr cation can cause a cooperative steric effect on the structure and affect the electrical properties of cafeo@xmath1 , opening up the band gap via a completely different mechanism .",
    "zr@xmath44)o@xmath1 and ( b ) illustration of band gap formation in cafeo@xmath1 ( left ) and ca(fe@xmath44zr@xmath44)o@xmath1 ( right ) . ]",
    "as discussed in the previous section , simply doping zr into @xmath26 cafeo@xmath1 does not increase the band gap except for one case where 2d jahn - teller instead of breathing mode serves to make the system insulating . in a perovskite system with rock - salt",
    "ordered alternating @xmath0 cations , such as cafeo@xmath1 , one @xmath0 cation type occupies entire ( 111 ) planes and the other type occupies its neighbors in all directions .",
    "since zr cation is larger than fe cation , to fully utilize its steric effect to distinguish fe@xmath5 from fe@xmath4 , it follows that zr should replace a full fe@xmath5 plane to increase the @xmath0o@xmath6 size on the plane , maximizing its utility by enhancing the cage size difference .",
    "a schematic of the ( 111 ) doping strategy and the influence of the dopants on their neighboring planes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfzo_111]b .",

    "the average @xmath0o@xmath6 octahedron size is listed on the side .",
    "( b ) schematic of how a layer of dopants with larger ionic radius exerts a cooperative size effect on the neighboring layers and enhances the existing charge ordering . ]",
    "following this logic , we perform calculations with @xmath47 cafeo@xmath1 super cell , which has six ( 111 ) feo@xmath45 layers stacked perpendicularly , as the parent material . one layer of fe s is replaced with zr s and the structural is relaxed .",
    "the final structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfzo_111]a , as well as the average @xmath0o@xmath6 cage size of each layer . clearly the introduction of a ( 111 ) zr layer drives the charge disproportionation of fe@xmath2 by exerting chemical pressure on both sides of the layer and favoring the feo@xmath6 on the two adjacent planes to be smaller and become fe@xmath4 .",
    "the second next neighboring layers in turn have more room to expand and favor larger fe@xmath5 .",
    "the size difference between the largest and the smallest feo@xmath6 cages ( @xmath48@xmath33 ) in this structure is an enhancement compared to pure cafeo@xmath1 @xmath49@xmath33 ) , which suggests the presence of a stronger charge ordering and a wider band gap .",
    "however electronic structure calculation shows that this solid material is metallic as well .",
    "the reason that the seemingly more charge ordered system still does not possess a gap can be attributed to the supercell employed . by using a unit cell with six ( 111 ) layers and replacing only one layer of fe with zr ,",
    "structurally the remaining five fe layers are disturbed by the large zr layer as expected .",
    "however the charge disproportionation reaction 2fe@xmath2@xmath3fe@xmath4+fe@xmath5 can not proceed to completion , because it requires an even number of fe layers .",
    "therefore with one layer of dopants there will always be fe@xmath2 `` leftovers '' that render the whole system metallic .    to resolve the issue of odd number of fe layers",
    "we introduce another layer of + 4 dopants with smaller ionic radius than fe . for simplicity",
    "we denote a solid solution in this case by listing the @xmath0 cations in each of its six ( 111 ) layers , with dopant elements in bold .",
    "for example , the previously discussed one layer zr - doped solid solution would be denoted as * * zr**fefefefefe .",
    "the presence of two dopant layers provides both positive and negative chemical pressure to expand fe@xmath5 and contract fe@xmath4 .",
    "these two dopant layers are separated by an even number of fe layers so that the feo@xmath6 size alternation is enhanced .",
    "an odd number of fe layers in between the dopant layers would disrupt and impede the size modulation period .",
    "relaxations are performed on * * zrni**fefefefe and * * zr**fefe**ni**fefe , as well as * * ceni**fefefefe and * * ce**fefe**ni**fefe . the average feo@xmath6 cage size per layer is listed in table  [ tab : size_111 ] , along with the maximum cage size difference @xmath39 and the corresponding band gap of each solid solution .",
    "it can be seen that with only zr as dopant , the @xmath39 is significantly smaller than those with two layers of dopants , and @xmath39 correlates with the band gap .",
    "the ce - containing solid solutions have a larger @xmath39 compared to the zr - containing ones , due to the larger size of ce .",
    "it also shows that when the larger dopant and the smaller dopant layers are adjacent , the resulting @xmath39 is larger than when they are two fe layers apart , this is due to the lack of symmetry of the former configuration where the absence of a mirror plane perpendicular to the @xmath50 axis allows for the feo@xmath6 close to the dopant layers to further expand or contract compared to the ones that are not neighbors of the dopant layers . in the latter configuration ,",

    "[ fig : gap ] we can see that with increasing difference in feo@xmath6 size , the band gap of the corresponding solid solutions increases accordingly . this relationship demonstrates the coupling between structural and electrical properties as larger feo@xmath6 size discrepancy indicates stronger and more complete charge disproportionation . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfzo_pdos]b , when charge ordering is the band gap opening mechanism , the gap size depends on the crystal field splitting energy difference between fe@xmath5 and fe@xmath4 .",
    "a larger feo@xmath6 cage size difference means that the o @xmath15 - fe @xmath46 repulsion difference is also larger between the two fe sites .",
    "this causes the energy difference of the @xmath12 orbitals in the two sites to increase and the band gap to increase as well . using linear regression we estimate that the chemical pressure excerted on the band gap by the volume difference in this type of solid solutions is quite large at about 370  gpa , in accordance with the effective band gap tuning .",
    "since the transition to metal occurs when thermally activated electrons have enough energy to cross the band gap and flow between the two fe sites to make them indistinguishable , we believe that by ( 111 ) doping the mit temperature of cafeo@xmath1 can be increased , making devices based on it more operable at room temperature .     of the ( 111 ) doped cafeo@xmath1 solid solutions increases with the corresponding maximum feo@xmath6 size difference @xmath39 .",
    "this gives an effective chemical pressure on the band gap of 2.30  ev / @xmath33 or 370  gpa . ]    to investigate the layered nature of the solid solutions , we use * * zrni**fefefefe as an example and plot the projected density of states of it in fig .",

    "[ fig : layered_pdos ] represents a layer of ca@xmath0o@xmath1 , and the relative position of the panels corresponds to the that of the six layers in the crystal .",
    "it can be seen clearly that for the four layers containing fe ions , the first and the third layers have more majority spin fe @xmath17 in the valence band , while the second and fourth layers have more majority spin fe @xmath17 in the valence band .",
    "this difference is consistent with the fact that fe@xmath5 has more filled @xmath17 orbitals than fe@xmath4 and supports our prediction that the doubly doped ( 111 ) layered cafeo@xmath1 has an enhanced charge ordering due to the strong modulation of the feo@xmath6 cage volume .",
    "o@xmath1 , and the relative position of the panels corresponds to the that of the six layers in the crystal . ]    to further verify the charge disproportionation mechanism , we performed oxidation state calculations of the fe cations in * * zrni**fefefefe .",
    "we employed an unambiguous oxidation state definition  @xcite based on wave function topology , whereby moving a target ion to its image site in an adjacent cell through an insulating path and calculating the polarization change during the process , the number of electrons that accompany the moving nucleus can be calculated .",
    "the oxidation state obtained this way is guaranteed to be an integer and is unique for an atom in a given chemical environment , not dependent on other factors such as charge partitioning or the choice of orbital basis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ox ] we show how the quantity @xmath56 changes as each fe cation is moved along an insulating path to the next cell , which is equivalent to the oxidation state of the cation .",
    "the two fe ions with larger cages are confirmed to be fe@xmath5 and the ones with smaller cages are fe@xmath4 .",
    "this proves that charge ordering occurs in this material and causes band gap opening .",
    "note that the oxidation states calculated are not directly related to the charges localized around the fe sites , which has been been shown to change insignificantly upon oxidation reaction in some cases  @xcite .",
    "in fact the bader charge  @xcite of the fe cations are 1.76 and 1.73 for the smaller and larger feo@xmath6 cages , respectively , which shows minuscule differences between fe sites that are in significantly different chemical environments in terms of oxygen ligand attraction .",
    "the ( 111 ) doping strategy shows that the size difference between fe@xmath5 and fe@xmath4 can be exploited and reinforced by selectively replacing layers of fe@xmath5 with fe@xmath4 with atoms of even larger or smaller size , respectively , to enhance charge ordering and the insulating character of the cafeo@xmath1 system .",

    "it is favorable to arrange them in a way that their size effects are cooperative and synergistic , producing a collective steric effect and greatly altering the structural and electrical properties .",
    "when doped on the ( 001 ) plane with larger zr cations , the in - plane lattice constant expands and supports a 2d jahn - teller type distortion , where each feo@xmath6 has two distinct fe - o bond length in the @xmath7 plane .",

    "the degree of charge ordering is closely related to the magnitude of feo@xmath6 cage size difference .",
    "we used the rigorous definition of oxidation state to verify that in the latter case the band gap opening mechanism is indeed charge disproportionation , as the oxidation states of the larger and smaller fe cations are calculated to be + 3 and + 5 , respectively .",
    "our results show that the structural and electrical properties of cafeo@xmath1 are coupled , and simple steric effects can enhance charge ordering transition and alter the band gap of the material greatly when the dopant atoms are placed to act cooperatively .",
    "lastly by enhancing the charge ordering via doping , we predict that the mit temperature of cafeo@xmath1 can also be increased to a temperature more suitable for practical device operation .",

    "<S> we report density functional theory ( dft ) investigation of @xmath0-site doped cafeo@xmath1 , a prototypical charge - ordered perovskite . at 290  k </S>",
    "<S> , cafeo@xmath1 undergoes a metal - insulator transition and a charge disproportionation reaction 2fe@xmath2@xmath3fe@xmath4+fe@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that when zr dopants occupy a ( 001 ) layer , the band gap of the resulting solid solution increases to 0.93  ev due to a 2d jahn - teller type distortion , where feo@xmath6 cages on the @xmath7 plane elongate along @xmath8 and @xmath9 alternatively between neighboring fe sites . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the rock - salt ordering of the fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 cations can be enhanced when the @xmath0-site dopants are arranged in a ( 111 ) plane due to a collective steric effect that facilitates the size discrepancy between the fe@xmath4o@xmath6 and fe@xmath5o@xmath6 octahedra and therefore gives rise to a larger band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced charge disproportionation in these solid solutions is verified by rigorously calculating the oxidation states of the fe cations with different octahedral cage sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore predict that the corresponding transition temperature will increase due to the enhanced charge ordering and larger band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the compositional , structural and electrical relationships exploited in this paper can be extended to a variety of perovskites and non - perovskite oxides providing guidance in structurally manipulating electrical properties of functional materials . </S>"
