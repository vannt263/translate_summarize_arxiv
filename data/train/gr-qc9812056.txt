    "observable consequences of the large scale topology of the universe are a subject of increasing interest .",
    "it has been recognized for some time that a topologically nontrivial universe can produce multiple images of individually identifiable objects in the sky , and our not having seen such images sets bounds on the potential scale of nontrivial topology in our universe @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was recognized that nontrivial topology can also leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background , through the quantum mechanical origin of density inhomogeneities and the subsequent sachs - wolfe effect , and the observational bounds obtained in this way could in fact be more stringent @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore another situation in which quantum fields in a curved spacetime feel the large scale topology : we consider the experiences of an inertial observer coupled to a quantum field in a spacetime that is locally de  sitter but has spatial topology @xmath0 instead of the usual  @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a free scalar field , and we assume the field to be in the globally regular vacuum state that is induced by the euclidean vacuum on de  sitter space . as the unconventional spatial topology lies beyond the cosmological horizon of the inertial observer , this problem illustrates how quantum fields can probe large scale topology that is classically unobservable by virtue of topological censorship @xcite .",
    "also , as the cosmological horizon of the observer does not coincide with a bifurcate killing horizon , this problem sheds light on the role of the bifurcate killing horizon in the thermal effects experienced by an inertial observer in de  sitter space @xcite .",
    "we shall find , from the analysis of a monopole particle detector , as well as from a bogoliubov transformation between the euclidean vacuum and the vacuum natural for the inertial observer , that the experiences of the inertial observer are not identical to those of an inertial observer in the euclidean vacuum in de  sitter space .",
    "however , in the limit of early or late proper times along the observer trajectory , the differences vanish exponentially , and the experiences of the observer become asymptotically thermal in the usual de  sitter hawking temperature .",
    "we also compute the renormalized stress - energy tensor , finding that it reduces to that in de  sitter space in the limit of early and late times on each inertial trajectory .",
    "these results conform to what one might call an exponential law : in expanding locally de  sitter spacetimes , differences due to global topology should fall off exponentially in the proper time . from the viewpoint of the absence of a bifurcate killing horizon , qualitatively similar results have been previously found on the single - exterior eternal black hole known as the @xmath0 geon @xcite and on the conformal boundary of the @xmath3-dimensional single - exterior black hole known as the @xmath4 geon @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : spacetimes ]",
    "we briefly review the properties of four - dimensional de  sitter spacetime , which we denote by  ds , and the quotient construction of a spacetime , denoted by @xmath1 , which has the same local geometry but whose spatial topology is  @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath22 is clearly invariant under the isometries of  ds , and it encodes almost all the isometry - invariant information about the relative location of @xmath16 and  @xmath17 . in particular , @xmath16 is on the light cone of @xmath17 if and only if @xmath23 . for more detail ,",

    "conversely , the 3 + 1 foliation of ds given by these coordinates is uniquely specified by the choice of a particular @xmath32 isometry subgroup .",

    "the boundary of @xmath40 , at @xmath59 , is the cosmological horizon for this observer , and the killing vector  @xmath60 , which is timelike in  @xmath40 , becomes null at the horizon .",
    "the horizon has therefore an infinite redshift .    in the quadrant @xmath61 , or @xmath62",
    ", a similar static chart can be introduced with the obvious modifications .",
    "the future and past quadrants , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , can be covered by charts in which ( [ static - chart - u ] ) and ( [ static - chart - v ] ) are replaced by    @xmath65    with the upper ( lower ) sign in ( [ qstatic - chart - u ] ) in the future ( past ) quadrant .",

    "this result conforms to the central tenet of inflationary cosmology , namely , that the physics in an exponentially expanding spacetime should become indistinguishable from physics in de  sitter space exponentially fast : what falls off exponentially in our case are the effects of the unconventional spatial topology on the quantum field .",
    "while our particle detector analysis accommodated an arbitrary inertial observer in @xmath1 , we only performed the bogoliubov transformation for an inertial observer whose world line is orthogonal to the distinguished foliation . as any inertial world line in @xmath1 has a neighborhood covered by the static metric  ( [ static - metric ] ) , such that the world line is at @xmath49 , the case of a nonorthogonal trajectory would also be in principle amenable to a bogoliubov transformation analysis .",

    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : quantization ] , @xmath1 can regarded as a lorentzian section of a complex spacetime whose riemannian section is a certain @xmath76 quotient of the round four - sphere , and the feynman propagator in @xmath122 continues to the unique green function on this riemannian section .",
    "a set of coordinates covering the riemannian section can be obtained from the static coordinates @xmath42 on @xmath81 by setting @xmath234 , provided the coordinates @xmath235 are identified as @xmath236 the first identification in ( [ riem - idents ] ) is just as for  ds , and this identification implies for the feynman propagator in @xmath104 complex analytic properties that correspond to thermality in the de  sitter hawking temperature @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "the second identification in ( [ riem - idents ] ) is specific to @xmath1 .",
    "one can argue that the complex analytic properties of the feynman propagator in @xmath122 are consistent with thermality in the limit of asymptotically early and late proper times : the reasoning is similar to that given for the @xmath0 geon in @xcite , and we shall not spell out the detail here .    the action of the riemannian section of @xmath1 is half of the action of the riemannian section of  ds . if one uses these actions in a semiclassical estimate to a quantum gravitational partition function , and if one associates to @xmath1 the de  sitter hawking temperature  @xmath237 , one finds for the entropy of @xmath1 the result @xmath238 , which is half of the value obtained for ds @xcite .",
    "an analogous observation was made in @xcite for the entropy of the @xmath0 geon .",
    "although the entropy associated with cosmological horizons may be physically less clear than the entropy associated with black hole horizons , it should prove interesting to understand whether this naive instanton - method evaluation of the entropy of @xmath1 could be physically justified , and in particular whether the factor half relative to ds might also arise in any state - counting approach to the entropy .",

    "both tensors are covariantly conserved and invariant under the isometries of the respective spacetimes .",
    "further , we can use the projection from ds to @xmath1 to map @xmath251 into a tensor on @xmath1 . by the usual abuse of notation ,",
    "we denote also this tensor on @xmath1 by @xmath251 .",
    "then @xmath253 is a well - defined , covariantly - conserved tensor on @xmath1 , and it fully characterizes the differences in the stress - energy tensors in @xmath104 and @xmath122 .",
    "equation ( [ stressenergy ] ) hence holds with @xmath254 .",
    "we now specialize to the conformally coupled massless field , @xmath133 and @xmath255 . as the divergences in the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor are purely local and anomalous , they are determined entirely by the local geometry .",
