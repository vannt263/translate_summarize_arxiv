    "the single - nucleon transfer reactions , induced by light as well as heavy ions , have been established as a useful tool in probing the single - particle components of the wave functions of stable nuclei ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of these reactions developed within the framework of the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite has been widely used to analyze the absolute magnitudes and shapes of measured cross sections and to deduce the structure information including angular momentum assignments , occupation probabilities and spectroscopic factors of the ground as well as excited states of the residual nuclei .",
    "nonetheless , transfer reactions are not yet routinely used in probing the structure of exotic nuclei near the neutron and proton drip lines , even though the first theoretical feasibility study @xcite for such investigations with transfer reactions and the first experimental results @xcite for the @xmath1be(p , d)@xmath4be reaction have been already reported . with the currently available experimental techniques ,",
    "the measurements of these reactions involving drip line nuclei are performed in the inverse kinematics with low intensity projectile beams .",
    "this puts severe experimental restrictions as the corresponding cross sections are usually low .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical analysis of these data in terms of the dwba gets complicated as the usual well - depth search method to calculate the wave function of the transfered particle becomes unreliable @xcite , and the methods such as skyrme hartree - fock theory need to be invoked @xcite for a proper description of these wave functions .",
    "recently , an alternative new and more versatile technique for investigating the spectroscopy of nuclei near the drip line has been developed @xcite . in this method , referred to as the ( a , b@xmath0 ) reaction in the following , one nucleon ( usually the valence or halo ) is removed from the projectile ( a ) in its breakup reaction within the field of a target nucleus .",
    "the states of the core fragment ( b ) populated in this reaction are identified by their gamma ( @xmath0 ) decay .",
    "the @xmath0-ray intensities are used to determine the partial breakup cross sections to different core states .",
    "the signatures of the orbital angular momentum @xmath5 associated with the relative motion of core states with respect to the valence nucleon ( removed from the projectile ) are provided by the measured parallel momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "this method improves the experimental conditions for working with projectiles of low beam intensities because of : ( i ) large partial cross sections for transitions to various bound states of the core fragment , even in experiments done with high - energy projectiles , ( ii ) possibility of using thick targets , and ( iii ) strong forward focusing .",
    "these features may be contrasted with those of the corresponding transfer reactions .",
    "in addition , while , in the case of transfer reactions , the angular distributions of the ejectile lose their characteristic @xmath5-dependence at high energies @xcite , the longitudinal momentum distributions of the core states in the breakup reactions continue to show a strong dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "most of the studies of the ( a , b@xmath0 ) reaction performed so far involve a light @xmath6be target , where the breakup process is governed almost entirely by only the nuclear interaction between the projectile fragments and the target . since , this reaction is essentially inclusive in nature ( as the measurements are performed only for the heavy core fragment ) , the nuclear partial cross sections have contributions from both elastic ( also known as diffraction dissociation ) and inelastic ( also known as stripping or breakup - fusion ) breakup modes @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to calculate the elastic and inelastic nuclear breakup cross sections of halo nuclei and they were either based on the semiclassical methods @xcite or on the eikonal approximation @xcite .",
    "the fragment - target interactions are dealt with differently in these two approaches which could be important for the light targets @xcite .",
    "data of refs .",
    "@xcite have been analyzed in terms of an eikonal model @xcite with core - target and neutron - target interactions treated in the black disc approximation and in the optical limit of the glauber theory , respectively . in order to extract unambiguous spectroscopic informations from the ( a , b@xmath0 ) type of measurements performed on a light target , it is quite desirable to develop the calculations of nuclear breakup reactions within the dwba theory as has been done for the breakup of stable projectiles @xcite .    however , currently a full quantum mechanical theory of the pure coulomb breakup reaction , formulated within the framework of the post - form distorted - wave born - approximation , is well established and has been applied successfully to investigate the breakup of halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "finite range effects are accounted for in this theory which can be applied to projectiles of any ground - state orbital angular - momentum structure .",
    "moreover , an alternative theory of the coulomb breakup reactions within the framework of an adiabatic model has also been formulated @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the breakup amplitude within this theory are very similar to those of the finite - range dwba theory , although the two have been derived under quite different assumptions . in the adiabatic model , it is assumed that the excited states of the projectile are degenerate with the ground state . in the studies of the breakup reactions done so far ( where the core fragments were assumed to remain in their ground states ) , the two theories produced almost identical results @xcite . however , with the excitation of the core , the one - neutron separation energies increase significantly .",
    "it would , therefore , be interesting to see if the two models lead to different results in these cases .",
    "there are no adjustable parameter in either of the theories of pure coulomb breakup reaction . assuming that the processes , in which the mutual excitation of the target nucleus takes place due to the coulomb interaction , contribute negligibly ,",
    "the inelastic breakup mode is absent in the pure coulomb breakup reactions .",
    "this is an added advantage as there is some ambiguity regarding the calculation of this mode which dominates the partial cross sections for the excited core states in the nuclear breakup process @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present calculations of the pure coulomb breakup contributions to the partial cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions of the ground as well as excited states of the core fragments , @xmath4be and @xmath7c , in the ( a , b@xmath0 ) type of reaction induced by @xmath1be and @xmath2c projectiles , respectively on a @xmath3pb target at the beam energy of 60 mev / nucleon .",
    "we assume that the states of the core fragments are the same as those seen in the similar reactions studied on the @xmath6be target .",
    "our aim is to determine if there are quantitative differences in the @xmath8 populations of the core states in the pure coulomb breakup mechanism , as compared to those observed in the pure nuclear breakup process .",
    "we shall also look whether there are differences in the predictions of the finite range dwba and adiabatic models of the breakup reactions leading to the core excited states .",
    "we want to make it clear from the very beginning that it is not our intention to imply that the nuclear breakup contributions are negligible for the reactions investigated by us .",
    "our results should be viewed as complementing contributions from the nuclear breakup process ; in any complete theory both contributions must be considered on an equal footing .    in the next section",
    "we briefly present the formalism of the coulomb breakup reactions .",
    "the results of our calculations and discussions are presented in section iii . a summary and the conclusions of our work",
    "are given in section iv .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath9 , where the projectile @xmath10 breaks up into fragments @xmath11 ( charged ) and @xmath12 ( uncharged ) in the coulomb field of a target @xmath13 .",
    "the chosen coordinate system is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the position vectors satisfy the following relations : @xmath14    the starting point of both the finite - range distorted - wave born approximation ( frdwba ) and of the adiabatic model of the coulomb breakup is the post - form @xmath15-matrix of the reaction given by @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 are the distorted waves for the relative motions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 and the center of mass ( c.m.)of the @xmath18 system , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath19 are the internal state wave functions of the concerned particles dependent on the internal coordinates @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 is the exact three - body scattering wave function of the projectile with a wave vector @xmath22 satisfying outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the jacobi wave vectors of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , in the final channel of the reaction .",
    "the function @xmath25 represents the interaction between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as we concentrate only on the pure coulomb breakup , the function @xmath26 is taken as the coulomb distorted wave ( for a point coulomb interaction between the charged core b and the target ) satisfying incoming wave boundary conditions , and the function @xmath27 is just a plane wave as there is no coulomb interaction between the target and the neutral fragment @xmath12 .    in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , we write @xmath28 the assumption inherent in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is that the breakup channels are very weakly coupled and hence this coupling needs to be treated only in the first order . in this equation the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath30 describes the relative motion of the fragments @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the ground state of the projectile .",
    "the function @xmath31 is the coulomb distorted scattering wave describing the relative motion of the c.m .  of the projectile with respect to the target , satisfying outgoing wave boundary conditions .",
    "it may be noted that the particular case of the pure coulomb breakup of a projectile involving one uncharged fragment , where the choice of the coordinate * r * may appear more natural to describe the relative motion between the projectile and the target , follows from this expression as discussed below .    the integration over the internal coordinates @xmath20 in the @xmath15-matrix gives @xmath32 with @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath5 ( the orbital angular momentum for the relative motion between fragments @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) is coupled to the spin of @xmath12 and the resultant channel spin @xmath34 is coupled to the spin @xmath35 of the core @xmath11 to yield the spin of @xmath10 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the @xmath15-matrix can now be be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the reduced @xmath15-matrix and with @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( 8) involves a six dimensional integral which makes the computation of @xmath39 quite complicated .",
    "the problem gets further acute because the integrand has a product of three scattering waves that exhibit an oscillatory behavior asymptotically . therefore ,",
    "approximate methods have been used , such as the zero range approximation ( zra ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , in which the product @xmath41 is replaced by a delta function , or the baur - trautmann approximation @xcite , where the projectile c.m .",
    "coordinate is replaced by that of the core - target system ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .",
    "both these approximations lead to a factorization of the reduced amplitude into two independent parts , which reduces the computational complexity . however , the application of both these methods to the reactions of halo nuclei is questionable @xcite .",
    "the zra necessarily restricts the relative motion between @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the projectile to @xmath43-state only . even for such cases ,",
    "this approximation may not be valid for heavier projectiles and at higher beam energies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the baur - trautmann approximation is justified if the c.m . of the @xmath11+@xmath12 system",
    "is shifted towards @xmath11 ( which is indeed the case if @xmath44 ) . however , since * r*@xmath45 occurs in association with the wave vector * k*@xmath46 , whose magnitude is quite appreciable at the higher beam energies , the neglected piece of * r*@xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath47 * r*@xmath48 ) may still contribute substantially .    in the frdwba theory , the coulomb distorted wave of particle @xmath11 in the final channel is written as @xcite @xmath49 equation ( 9 ) represents an exact taylor series expansion about @xmath50 if @xmath51 is treated exactly .",
    "however , instead of doing this we employ a local momentum approximation @xcite , where the magnitude of momentum @xmath52 is taken to be @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the reduced mass of the @xmath55 system , @xmath56 is the energy of particle @xmath11 relative to the target in the c.m .",
    "system and @xmath57 is the coulomb potential between @xmath11 and the target separated by @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the momentum of @xmath59 is evaluated at some separation @xmath58 which is held fixed for all the values of @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath58 was taken to be equal to 10 fm . for reactions under investigation in this paper ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath61 remains constant for distances larger than 10 fm @xcite . due to the peripheral nature of the breakup reaction",
    ", the region @xmath62 fm contributes maximum to the cross section . in fact , the calculated cross sections change by only about 5@xmath63 if @xmath58 is varied between 5 to 10 fm and with a further increase in r the change is less than 1@xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , the results of the calculations for these reactions , at the beam energies under investigation , are almost independent of the choice of the direction of momentum @xmath52@xcite .",
    "therefore , we have taken the directions of @xmath59 and @xmath64 to be the same in all the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "it may be remarked here that in ref .",
    "@xcite an approximation similar to eq .",
    "( 9 ) was applied to the coulomb distorted wave of the incident channel .",
    "that procedure brings in two difficulties .",
    "firstly , the choice of the direction of the local momentum is somewhat complicated as directions of the both fragments in the final channel will have to be brought into consideration .",
    "secondly , the procedure may produce a deviation from the exact dwba approximation .    on substituting eq .",

    "recently , an alternative theory of the coulomb breakup has been developed within the adiabatic ( ad ) model @xcite .",
    "this theory assumes ( i ) that one of the fragments ( the valence nucleon ) is neutral so that the projectile interacts with the target only through the coulomb interaction @xmath67 of the core fragment and the target nucleus , and ( ii ) that the relative excitation energy @xmath68 of the b - c system is much smaller than the total incident energy so that @xmath68 can be replaced by the constant separation energy of the fragments in the projectile ground state . following ( ii )",
    "the continuum spectrum of the @xmath69 system is assumed to be degenerate with the ground state . under the above assumptions , the wave function @xmath21 is found @xcite in the form @xmath70 it is clear that substitution of eq .",

    "( 3 ) will lead to a factored form ( similar to eq .",
    "( 11 ) ) of the reduced breakup amplitude .",
    "however , one limitation of this procedure should be brought into attention . for larger values of @xmath71 , the wave function @xmath72 vanishes due to the presence of the factor @xmath73 , whereas there may still be contributions to the breakup from this region .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that , due the presence of the interaction @xmath74 , the post form breakup amplitude may not be sensitive to the domain where @xmath72 is inaccurate .",
    "however , since the wave functions for the relative motion of the fragments for @xmath75 values have a large spatial extension , the application of this model to such cases may test the need for the non - adiabatic corrections to the theory .",

    "equation  ( 13 ) can also be obtained in the dwba model by making a local momentum approximation to the coulomb distorted wave in the initial channel of a reaction and by evaluating the local momentum at @xmath78 with the momentum direction being the same as that of the projectile . in both of the theories , the coulomb interaction between the fragments @xmath11 and",
    "the target is treated non - perturbatively .",
    "the adiabatic model does not make the weak coupling approximation of the dwba .",
    "however , it necessarily requires one of the fragments ( in this case @xmath12 ) to be neutral .",

    ". one of our aims was to see in what way the coulomb dominated reaction mechanism was different and could supplement the conclusions derived from the pure nuclear breakup studies of the nuclei .",
    "the advantage of the pure coulomb break up process is that the corresponding theory has no free adjustable parameter , and assuming that the mutual excitation of the target by the coulomb force is negligible , the inelastic breakup mode does not contribute to this process .    as in the previous studies",
    "@xcite , we assumed that the coupling between the core states is weak and that there is no dynamical excitation of these states .",
    "thus , the reaction can only populate those core states which have a non - zero spectroscopic factor for a given neutron - core configuration in the projectile ground state .",
    "we employed both the finite range dwba and adiabatic model of the coulomb breakup theory in our calculations . in earlier studies @xcite of the inclusive coulomb dissociation cross sections , the two theories produced nearly identical results for the momentum distributions of heavy fragments .",
    "we found that in reactions of the type a(a , b@xmath0)x on a heavy target , the core ground state is predominantly excited ; higher energy states account for only a few percent of the total cross section .",
    "this finding is in contrast to the results obtained on similar reactions on a light target , where about a quarter of the total breakup cross section could be due to transitions to core excited states .",
    "our finding is supported by a recent measurement @xcite of the @xmath117au(@xmath118,@xmath119b@xmath0)x reaction at the beam energy of 60 mev .",
    "the reason for this difference is attributed to the fact that pure coulomb breakup cross sections drop very strongly as the separation energy increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the nuclear breakup cross sections decrease slowly with increasing se",
    ". therefore , such reactions on a heavy target are potentially a more useful tool for investigating the properties of the ground state of the core fragments .",
    "a rather interesting result of our study is that the finite - range dwba and the adiabatic theories of coulomb breakup lead to very different longitudinal momentum distributions for the excited states of the core fragments .",
    "it is probably for the first time that such a large difference is seen in the predictions of two theories for the momentum distributions .",
    "this should provide some impetus to look for the non - adiabatic corrections to the adiabatic approximation which may come under some pressure for the excited states .",
    "coulomb dominated breakup reactions may provide a better way for resolving the uncertainty associated with the one neutron separation energy of @xmath2c .",
    "the peak value and the full width at half maximum of the longitudinal momentum distributions for the ground state of @xmath7c core are more sensitive to the one - neutron separation energy in the coulomb breakup process than in the nuclear breakup . in the latter case",
    ", the dependence could be so weak that the data with limited statistics may not allow to distinguish between the values of these quantities calculated with quite different one - neutron separation energies .",
