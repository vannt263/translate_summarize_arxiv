    "the migdal effect is known since long time and is described both in devoted papers @xcite and in textbooks @xcite ; it has also been recently addressed for the dark matter ( dm ) field in ref .",
    "this effect consists in the ionization and the excitation of bound atomic electrons induced by the presence of a recoiling atomic nucleus . in this paper",
    ", it will be accounted in the case of the wimp - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "in fact , since the recoiling nucleus can `` shake off '' some of the atomic electrons , an electromagnetic contribution is present together with a recoil signal in the analysis of dm direct searches ( with whatever approach ) when interpreted in terms of wimp candidates .",
    "since this contribution is not quenched , one can expect that this part ( usually unaccounted ) can play a role as well .    in this paper",
    "the related theoretical framework is developed and some of the previous corollary analyses for wimp candidates @xcite from the dama / nai annual modulation results ( total exposure of 107731 kg @xmath0 day ) are used for template purpose .",
    "we just remind that , in order to investigate in a model independent way the presence of dm particle component(s ) in the galactic halo , dama / nai @xcite has exploited over seven annual cycles the dm annual modulation signature , achieving a 6.3 @xmath1 c.l . model independent evidence @xcite .",
    "some of the many possible corollary quests for the candidate particle(s ) have also been carried out so far mainly focusing various possibilities for the class of dm candidate particles named wimps and for the class of light bosons @xcite ; other corollary quests are also available in literature , such as e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , and many other scenarios can be considered as well .",
    "the possible excitation and ionization of the atom by a recoiling nucleus  induced by a wimp - nucleus elastic scattering  give rise to a certain quantity of electromagnetic radiation made of the escaping electron and of x - rays and/or auger electrons arising from the rearrangement of the atomic shells .",
    "this radiation is fully contained in a detector of suitable size .",
    "since the wimp - nucleus interaction is expected to have a very short range ( e.g. being mediated by very heavy particles with mass @xmath2 ) , the duration of the collision ( @xmath3 s ) is negligible with respect to the electron orbit periods and to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the atomic size and @xmath6 is the nucleus velocity after the interaction .",
    "thus , the interaction can be considered as instantaneous and a semiclassical description of the recoil process can be applied following the migdal approach @xcite : the target nucleus is assumed to be at rest for @xmath7 and at @xmath8 it suddenly acquires the @xmath9 velocity because of the interaction .",
    "therefore , after the collision the wave function of the electronic states at @xmath8 can be approximated as @xcite : @xmath10 \\cdot \\psi_i(\\vec{r}_1,\\vec{r}_2 , ... ) .",
    "\\label{eq : m1}\\ ] ] in this relation : i ) @xmath11 is their wave function in the rest frame of the nucleus before the interaction ; ii ) @xmath12 is the coordinate vector of the @xmath13 electron ; iii ) @xmath14 with @xmath15 electron mass .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) the probability @xmath16 to reach the intrinsic state @xmath17 starting from an initial state @xmath18 can be written as : @xmath19 in the following , the case of the transition of an electron from one level to another and the case of its transition to the continuum ( that is , the ionization of the atom ) are separately analysed applying the reasonable approximation that multiple transition / ionization processes can safely be neglected .",
    "the total transition probability can be calculated from the single electron transition probability , @xmath20 , by exploiting the mean field approximation .",
    "in particular , we consider that the wave function of a single electron does not depend on the coordinates of the other ones .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath20 of the transition of a single electron from an initial state @xmath21 to a final bound state @xmath22 is simply :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the coordinate vector of the considered electron .    the term @xmath25 can safely be expanded in series by applying the dipole approximation .",
    "in fact , since @xmath6 is at maximum of the order of the impinging wimp velocity ( less than the galaxy escape velocity : @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 m , we can write @xmath28 . thus , considering that in practice : @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m5 ] ) can be re - written as : @xmath32 retaining only the leading orders .",
    "as first , the probability for a single electron to retain the same state can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the atomic form factor of the orbital described by the @xmath35 wave function .",
    "it can be derived from the rayleigh scattering database ( rtab ) @xcite , where the atomic form factors for the levels of the various atoms are reported .",
    "some examples of the used atomic form factors for the sodium and iodine atoms are reported in fig .",
    "[ fg : ff ] ; for the shell 1s the atomic form factors calculated by means of the hydrogenic wave functions are also reported for comparison , showing a good agreement .    [ !",
    "ht ]      on the other hand , for the transitions ( @xmath36 ) one gets : @xmath37 because of the states orthogonality .",
    "if we define @xmath38 as the angle between the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , this transition probability can be re - written as : @xmath41 since the atoms are unpolarized , @xmath42 can be replaced by its average : 1/3 , that is    @xmath43    the @xmath44 matrix elements are connected with the standard dimensionless oscillator strengths , @xmath45 , by means of ( as usual , here : @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy of the transition and , in conclusion , the transition probability can be expressed as : @xmath49    the oscillator strengths for several atoms can also be derived from the rayleigh scattering database @xcite .",

    "considering the free electron approximation ( that is , neglecting the interaction of the escaping electron with the nucleus ) , the final state of the escaping electron can be described as a plane wave @xcite : @xmath50 , normalized to a volume @xmath51 .",
    "the final state density is : @xmath52 .",

    "the ionization profile , @xmath59 , is normalized to 1 , as it can be easily demonstrated : @xmath60 .    finally , for practical purposes @xmath61 ; in fact , since the maximum energy provided by the wimp with mass , @xmath62 , and velocity , @xmath63 , to a nucleus with mass , @xmath64 , is @xmath65 , the maximum velocity is : @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 kev and can be safely neglected with respect to @xmath68 when the electron energy is larger than 10 ev .",
    "the energy distribution of the escaping electron can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m11 ] ) by introducing the variable @xmath69 ( escaping energy of the electron ) and by integrating over the solid angle .",
    "the angular integration can be easily performed by considering an average ionization profile for all the @xmath70 electrons in a full shell , where @xmath71 is isotropic .",
    "thus , we can define the ionization profile of a given shell as a function of the escaping energy of the electron according to : @xmath72 moreover , in the real cases , the ionization is energetically allowed only for @xmath73 , with @xmath74 binding energy of the electron .    [ !",
