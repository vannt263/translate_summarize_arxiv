    "plasticity between neural connections plays a key role in our ability to process and store information .",
    "one of the fundamental questions on plasticity , is the extent to which local processes , affecting individual synapses , are responsible for large scale structures of neural connectivity .",
    "here we focus on two types of structures : synfire chains and self connected assemblies .",
    "these structures are often proposed as forms of neural connectivity that can support brain functions such as memory and generation of motor activity .",
    "we show that an important plasticity mechanism , spike timing dependent plasticity , can lead to autonomous emergence of these large scale structures in the brain : in contrast to previous theoretical proposals , we show that the emergence can occur autonomously even if instructive signals are not fed into the neural network while its form is shaped by synaptic plasticity .",
    "one of the striking features of local organisation in the brain is its diversity across brain regions and cell populations @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of significant importance to understand the factors that contribute to the organization of local neural circuitry . among such factors ,",
    "synaptic plasticity involves mechanisms that rely on neural activity @xcite , as first proposed by hebb @xcite .",
    "spike timing dependent plasticity ( stdp ) , observed in many brain areas , depends on the relative timing of pre and post synaptic spikes @xcite .",
    "this form of plasticity introduces a coupling between the ongoing activity in a neural network and its architecture , because the change in synaptic efficacy is driven by the timing of neural spikes , while the statistics characterizing neural activity are strongly dependent on the connectivity .",
    "this link raises interesting questions from a functional and computational perspective .",
    "considerable theoretical effort was devoted to elucidate the coupling between neural activity and plasticity , when considering modifiable synapses that converge into one post synaptic neuron @xcite .",
    "when considering stdp in a network of recurrently connected neurons , the coupling between activity and plasticity becomes even more elaborate , since the timing of spikes in each neuron is potentially influenced by the activity of all other neurons in the network .",
    "consequently , the change in one synapse can depend on the full connectivity structure in a complicated manner .",
    "most theoretical works on stdp in recurrent neural networks approximated the dynamics of each synapse as depending on local quantities : the firing rates of the pre and post synaptic neurons @xcite , and the strengths of the synapses between them @xcite .",
    "these local approximations provide important insights on synaptic dynamics driven by stdp , such as the competition that arises between reciprocal synapses under an asymmetric stdp function @xcite .",
    "however , local approximations do not fully address how plasticity in a given synapse is influenced by other synapses in the network .",
    "only very recently consequences of stdp in recurrent neural networks were studied analytically , without resorting to the local approximations discussed above . in ref .",
    "@xcite an expression was derived for the dynamics of synaptic efficacies in recurrent neural networks , based on an approximation for spike correlations in networks of leaky integrate and fire neurons .",
    "this approach has led to the understanding that stdp induces effective interactions between pairs of adjacent synapses .",
    "these interactions , in turn , influence the connectivity , and specifically the distribution of local motifs which include pairs of synapses .",
    "these results highlight the elaborate role played by stdp in shaping the structure of recurrent neural circuits .",
    "many questions remain open , or have received so far only partial answers : is it possible to describe in a systematic manner interactions between synapses of all orders , beyond the pairwise interactions analyzed in previous works ?",
    "can stdp induce global ordered structures in the connectivity , beyond its influence on the statistical distribution of local motifs within the network ? how do biophysical properties , such as the structure of the stdp function and the time course of synaptic current , influence the emergent structures ?    the first goal of this work is to provide a full description of non - local interactions between different synapses in recurrent neural networks .",
    "we develop an expression for the synaptic dynamics in recurrent networks of poisson spiking neurons , which precisely describes how stdp in each synapse depends on the full network connectivity .",
    "the main advantage of using this neural model is that all the expressions we obtain are precise and fully self - consistent , without resorting to any approximations other than those embodied in our model for the intrinsic dynamics of individual neurons .",
    "furthermore , this approach leads to a systematic description of non - local synaptic interactions , expressed as a sum over contributions from structural motifs of varying orders . using this formalism",
    ", we demonstrate that non - local interactions between different synapses can profoundly influence the synaptic connectivity that emerges under stdp .",
    "a second goal of this work is to show that high order , non local interactions between different synapses can promote the spontaneous formation of global organization in the connectivity .",
    "this result is significant on its own merit ( see below ) , but it also serves as a concrete example for the possible role of high - order synaptic interactions in shaping the structure of neural circuits .",
    "we focus on two specific types of structures : wide synfire chains , and assemblies of self connected neurons ( fig  [ fig : illustration ] ) .",
    "the formalism developed here allows us also to predict how biophysical parameters , such as the specific stdp function and the temporal trace of post synaptic currents , impact on the structures that emerge .",
