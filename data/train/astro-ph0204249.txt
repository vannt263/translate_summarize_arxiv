    "* ) ; in particular : ( i ) when the universe will age by a factor of a few , the event horizon will stall at a fixed proper distance of @xmath3 gpc around us ( where @xmath4 is the present hubble constant in units of @xmath5 ) ; ( ii ) all sources with present redshifts larger than 1.8 have already crossed our event horizon and are therefore out of causal contact today ; and ( iii ) even if we continue to monitor the sources with current redshifts of @xmath6 into the infinite future , we will only be able to see these sources acquire intrinsic ages of @xmath7 billion years in their rest frame .",
    "in this paper we use n - body simulations to calculate the future gravitational growth of the observed large - scale structure in the local universe . for simplicity , we assume that the vacuum energy density is constant in time ( as for a classical cosmological constant ) and adopt the values @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we simulate the evolution of density inhomogeneities within a sphere of radius @xmath11 around the milky way galaxy .",
    "our goal is to determine the time when the accelerated expansion of the universe will freeze the large - scale structures in distant future , as well as to find the minimum overdensity of matter interior to a shell surrounding an object today that will allow the shell to remain bound to the object at late times despite the repulsive gravitational force of the vacuum .",
    "another issue of particular interest is the question whether the local group of galaxies is bound to the nearby virgo cluster .",
    "it has been well - established that the local group has a peculiar infall velocity towards the direction of the virgo cluster , the so - called ` virgocentric infall ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it has not been investigated yet by a direct numerical simulation whether the local group will eventually fall into the virgo cluster in the future given the observed galaxy distribution in the local universe .",
    "the possibility remains that the virgocentric infall will freeze in comoving coordinates due to the exponential expansion of the universe , and the local group will not ultimately merge with the virgo cluster .",
    "we investigate this issue for the first time by running an n - body simulation , starting from initial conditions at z=0 that match the observed galaxy distribution in the nearby universe and ending it in a distant future .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ section : simulation ] we describe the characteristics of our n - body simulations for the evolution of the global structure of the local universe .",
    "the results from the simulations are discussed in   [ section : evolution ] .",
    "we then derive in   [ section : bound ] the present - day overdensity threshold for a spherical region to collapse in the future , and apply this condition to the local group in ",
    "[ section : lg ] .",

    "[ section : conclusion ] .",
    "the simulations were carried out with the parallel tree n - body / sph code gadget @xcite .",
    "the sph component of the code was turned off as we are only interested in the dark matter particles which dominate the fluctuating mass density . for the initial conditions",
    ", we used the simulation output of @xcite at @xmath12 .",
    "this simulation was designed so that at @xmath12 the simulated mass density field would best match the observed galaxy overdensity distribution in the _ iras _ 1.2 jy survey of @xcite .",
    "@xcite constructed mock catalogues of the mark iii catalogue of peculiar velocities @xcite using their simulation result , and have shown that the radial peculiar velocities in mock and real catalogues agree very well .",
    "the original data set of @xcite contains 50.7 million dark matter particles of mass @xmath13 within the comoving radius of @xmath14 around the supergalactic center ( inner high - resolution region ) , and 20.5 million particles within the comoving radius of @xmath15 ( outer low - resolution region ) .",
    "the simulation of this spherical region was run with a vacuum boundary condition .",
    "because we are only interested in the evolution of the structure with mass - scale larger than that of the local group , we reduce the original data set by a factor of 100 through random sampling of particles .",
    "this reduction of data allows us to run the simulation with a relatively low computational cost while preserving the mass and spatial resolution we need to make predictions for the questions we are interested in , given the observed galaxy distribution in the nearby universe .",
    "the resulting mass of each dark matter particle in the high resolution region is @xmath16 ( comparable to the mass of an @xmath17 galaxy ) , and the number of high resolution particles is half a million .",
    "we have set the gravitational softening length to the physical scale of @xmath18 , since structures below this scale are not of interest . this mass and spatial resolution is sufficient for following the overall structure of the local universe , but not sufficient for resolving the inner details of galaxy groups such as the local group , of which the milky way galaxy is the dominant member .    using the reduced data set",
    ", we have simulated the evolution of the local universe from the present time ( corresponding to a scale factor value of @xmath19 at @xmath12 ) to the 6 hubble times into the future ( @xmath20 ; @xmath21 billion years from today ) .",
    "because the present hubble time @xmath22 gyr ( for @xmath10 ) is very close to the present age of the universe @xmath23 gyr in the adopted cosmology , the epoch of @xmath20 roughly corresponds to @xmath24 from the big bang ( @xmath25 ) . note that we denote all present - day values with a subscript zero .",
    "in addition to the above constrained realization simulation of the local universe , we have also performed a simulation with a periodic box of @xmath26 containing @xmath27 dark matter particles , in order to make sure that the statistical results presented in this paper are not affected by cosmic variance or by the choice of the vacuum boundary condition for the constrained realization run . statistically , we find that the results from the two runs agree very well with one another , and so we only show the results from the constrained realization run in ",

    "it is interesting to note that the numerical code speeds up its calculation at late cosmic times .",

    "close examination of the structures reveals that most of the evolution takes place between @xmath36 and @xmath31 , and little evolution is seen after @xmath37 .",

    "<S> we simulate the future evolution of the observed inhomogeneities in the local universe assuming that the global expansion rate is dominated by a cosmological constant . we find that within two hubble times ( @xmath0 billion years ) from the present epoch , large - scale structures will freeze in comoving coordinates and the mass distribution of bound objects will stop evolving . the local group will get somewhat closer to the virgo cluster in comoving coordinates , but will be pulled away from the virgo in physical coordinates due to the accelerated expansion of the universe . in the distant future </S>",
    "<S> there will only be one massive galaxy within our event horizon , namely the merger product of the andromeda and the milky way galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> all galaxies that are not gravitationally bound to the local group will recede away from us and eventually exit from our event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we identify the critical interior overdensity above which a shell of matter around an object will remain bound to it at late times .    </S>",
