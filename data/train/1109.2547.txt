    "the control of fluid flow in channels of micron - scale dimensions is essential for proper functioning of any lab - on - a - chip device . the fluid transport in microchannels is often performed by downscaling conventional methods such as syringe pumps , micropumps @xcite , or by exploiting electro - magnetic fluid manipulation principles , as in electro - osmotic @xcite and magneto - hydrodynamic @xcite devices . in search for novel ways to propel fluids at micron scales , we let nature be our guide .",
    "nature uses hair - like structures , called cilia , attached to the surfaces of micro - organisms , to propel fluids at small length scales .",
    "the typical length of a cilium is 10 microns .",
    "cilia beat in a whip - like asymmetric manner consisting of an effective stroke and a recovery stroke .",
    "moreover , when many cilia operate together , hydrodynamic interactions cause them to beat out - of - phase @xcite , leading to the formation of metachronal waves , and an enhanced fluid flow @xcite . the specific metachrony is termed symplectic ( or antiplectic ) when the metachronal wave is in the same ( or opposite ) direction as the effective stroke .",
    "the cilia on a paramecium exhibit antiplectic metachrony , whereas the cilia on opalina exhibit symplectic metachrony @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric motion of natural cilia is due to the intricate interaction between the cilia micro - structure ( axoneme ) and the internal driving force generated by atp - enabled conformational changes of the motor protein dynein .",
    "it is a challenging task to design the artificial counterpart of natural cilia , by using external force fields for actuation in order to mimic the asymmetric motion of natural cilia .",
    "an early attempt to create artificial cilia was based on electrostatic actuation of arrays of plate - like artificial cilia @xcite .",
    "although effective flow and mixing were achieved , movement of these artificial cilia was not asymmetric as in the case of natural cilia .",
    "it was predicted using numerical simulations that an array of identical super - paramagnetic or permanently magnetic two - dimensional plate - like cilia can mimic the planar asymmetric motion of natural cilia when exposed to a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these magnetic plate - like cilia can be realised , for instance , by using polymer films with embedded super - paramagnetic ( or permanently magnetic ) nano - particles ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast with the plate - like cilia , rod - like structures that mimic the three - dimensional motion of nodal cilia to create fluid propulsion have also been fabricated @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a novel method of fluid propulsion based on magnetic walkers was presented .",
    "artificial cilia based on photo - actuation have also been realised in the recent past @xcite .    in previous numerical studies we focused on the flow created by an array of synchronously - beating plate - like cilia",
    "whose motion is planar and asymmetric , in the absence @xcite and presence of fluid inertia @xcite .",
    "it was reported that a substantial but fluctuating flow is created in the former , while in the latter the flow increases significantly as the reynolds number is increased .",
    "in addition , the fluid flow can become unidirectional in the presence of fluid inertia . in this work",
    "we explore another aspect of natural ciliary propulsion using numerical simulations - the metachronal motion of cilia , by allowing the asymmetrically - beating artificial cilia to move out - of - phase .",
    "the out - of - phase motion of the cilia is achieved by applying a magnetic field that has a phase lag between adjacent cilia .",
    "the existing literature on the metachronal motion of natural cilia could provide insights on the flow generated in the presence of metachronal waves .",
    "in the case of natural cilia the metachronal motion is analysed principally for two reasons .",
    "first , to find the effect of the metachronal waves on the flow created and second , to find the physical origin of the metachronal waves .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies have been undertaken by biologists and fluid mechanicians to understand the flow created by an array of cilia ( see for e.g.  the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these analyses have been performed to model the flow of specific biological systems ( e.g.  micro - organisms or airway cilia ) , however , a systematic study is lacking . in the following ,",
    "we outline a number of studies in which the effect of the metachronal waves on fluid transport has been studied . modelling",
    "approaches to understand the cilia - driven flow include the envelope model @xcite , the sublayer model @xcite , fluid structure interaction models using a lattice - boltzmann approach @xcite , and the immersed boundary method @xcite . in the envelope model , the cilia",
    "are assumed to be very densely spaced so that the fluid experiences an oscillating surface consisting of the tips of the cilia .",
    "the envelope model is accurate only when the cilia are spaced very close together , which has only been observed in the case of symplectic metachrony @xcite . in the sublayer model @xcite , the cilia",
    "are represented by a distribution of stokeslets with appropriate mirror images to satisfy the no - slip condition on the surface to which the cilia are attached .",
    "the sublayer model predicts that for an organism that exhibits antiplectic metachrony , the flow created is lower than for cilia beating in - phase .",
    "in the case of an organism exhibiting symplectic metachrony , the opposite trend is observed . in the numerical study of @xcite , the flow due to the out - of - phase motion of a finite number of magnetic cilia subjected to an oscillating external magnetic field was studied .",
    "the magnetic cilia generate an asymmetric motion due to the difference in the speed of oscillation of the magnetic field during the effective and recovery strokes .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , it was predicted that the flow in the case of antiplectic metachrony is larger than the flow created by a symplectic metachrony for a particular inter - cilia spacing .",
    "early experiments indicated that the hydrodynamic coupling between cilia could be the cause for the formation of the metachronal waves ( see for e.g.  the review by * ? ? ? * ) . by mimicking the ciliary motion of paramecia using an internal actuation mechanism",
    ", it was demonstrated that cilia , which were initially beating in - phase , will form an antiplectic metachronal wave after a few beat cycles @xcite .",
    "this behaviour was explained to be an outcome of the hydrodynamic interactions between neighbouring cilia .",
    "similar hydrodynamically - caused metachronal motion of the cilia was also observed in the numerical work of @xcite . in @xcite , it was reported that in the presence of the metachronal wave the cilia become more efficient in creating flow .",
    "the synchronization and phase locking of the cilia have also been analysed using simple experimental @xcite and analytical @xcite models .",
    "it was found that some degree of flexibility is required for the phase locking of the cilia to take place @xcite .",
    "the requirement of the flexibility for synchronization is also confirmed from the more detailed model of @xcite . in the aforementioned studies , however , the metachronal wave is an outcome of that specific system , and the flow or the efficiency has not been studied for different types of metachronal waves .",
    "the goal of this paper is , therefore , to obtain a full understanding of the dependence of flow on the magnetically - induced out - of - phase motion of an array of asymmetrically beating plate - like artificial cilia at low reynolds numbers .",
    "we will answer the following questions using a coupled solid - fluid magneto - mechanical computational model . how does the generated flow in the presence of metachrony differ from the flow generated by cilia that beat in - phase ?",
    "how does the flow depend on the metachronal wave speed and its direction , and how does it depend on the cilia spacing ?",
    "we answer these questions in the light of magnetic artificial cilia which exhibit an asymmetric motion and beat out - of - phase",
    ". however , the results are equally applicable to any ciliary system in which the cilia exhibit an asymmetric and out - of - phase motion .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the boundary value problem , the governing equations and the numerical solution methodology are explained in section [ sec : problem_cilia_meta_delta_phi ] . in section [ sec : results_cilia_meta_no_bf ] , the physical mechanisms responsible for the enhanced flow in the presence of metachronal waves are discussed .",
    "the quantitative variation of the flow as a function of the phase difference and cilia spacing is given .",
    "finally , the outcome of the analysis is summarised in section [ sec : conclusion_out - of - phase ] .",
    "we study the flow in an infinitely long channel of height @xmath0 created by a two - dimensional array of plate - like magnetic artificial cilia ( having length @xmath1 and thickness @xmath2 ) , which are actuated using a rotating magnetic field which is uniform over each cilium , but with a phase difference between adjacent cilia .",
    "the external magnetic field experienced by the @xmath3 cilium is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field , the phase of the magnetic field @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the angular frequency and @xmath8 is the time period of rotation of the magnetic field . the magnetic field experienced by the individual cilia during a particular instance in time",

    "the chosen form of the phase @xmath10 makes the phase of the magnetic field at every @xmath11 cilium identical .",
    "that is , the magnetic field is periodic after @xmath12 repeats of cilia .",
    "consequently , the applied magnetic field travels @xmath12 cilia units in time @xmath8 , so that the phase velocity of the magnetic field is @xmath13 ( in cilia per second ) .",
    "the phase velocity is to the right ( positive ) and the magnetic field at each cilium position rotates counterclockwise with time . the typical asymmetric motion of a cilium is shown in fig .",

    "the trajectory of the free end of a typical cilium is represented by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_meta_schematic](b ) , with the arrows representing the direction of motion .",
    "due to the super - paramagnetic ( spm ) nature of the cilia , for which the magnetization is proportional to the magnetic field , the magnetic body couple ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the magnetization of the cilia and @xmath16 is the magnetic field experienced by the cilia ) depends only on the orientation and magnitude of the magnetic field , but not on its sign . as a result , the body couple at the @xmath3 cilium @xmath17 , which determines its motion , scales with @xmath18 @xcite",
    "this has consequences for the motion of the cilia , both temporally and spatially .",
    "temporally , the frequency of the magnetic couple is twice that of the applied magnetic field .",
    "this results in two cilia beats for one 360@xmath19 rotation of the magnetic field .",
    "spatially , the phase of the magnetic couple is twice that of the applied magnetic field , so that the phase difference between neighbouring cilia is twice as large .",
    "this means that the magnetic couple is periodic after @xmath20 cilia .",
    "since both the frequency and phase difference increase by a factor 2 , the phase velocity of the magnetic torque remains equal to that of the magnetic field , i.e.  @xmath21 . note",

    "when the phase difference is too large , the metachronal wave can change sign , so that the metachronal wave is observed to travel in a direction opposite to the direction of the magnetic field ( see appendix [ sec : apparent_velocity ] ) .",
    "the metachronal wave velocity is equal to @xmath21 ( i.e.  to the right ) when @xmath23 , and it is equal to @xmath24 ( i.e.  to the left ) when @xmath25 , see fig .",

    "[ fig : case3_meta_flow_with_time ] ) as a function of time for different phase differences .",
    "when the cilia move synchronously ( @xmath118 ) , the flux ( see the solid line in fig .  [",
    "fig : case3_meta_flux_with_time ] ) is positive for approximately three - quarters of the time and strongly negative during the rest of the cycle .",
    "consequently , the flow generated ( see the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_meta_flow_with_time ] ) increases during the effective stroke , but profoundly decreases when the recovery stroke takes place .",
    "this creates a large fluctuation in the flow , with only a small net amount of fluid transported .",
    "once the ciliary motion is metachronal , the negative flux is very small compared to the positive flow ( see the cases of a standing wave and antiplectic metachrony in fig .  [",

    "this decreases the fluctuation in the flow generated , causing it to increase nearly monotonously during the beat cycle ( see the dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : case3_meta_flow_with_time ] ) .",
    "we can clearly see that the flow at the end of the beat cycle ( @xmath119 ) for out - of - phase motion is significantly larger than the flow created by the synchronously beating cilia .",

    "as the cilia density is increased by decreasing @xmath91 from @xmath121 to @xmath115 , the viscous resistance per cilium decreases , which causes the normalised flow to increase to 0.25 . when the cilia beat in - phase , the effectiveness of fluid propulsion is very low , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cilia_meta_results_effectiveness ] .",
    "the fluid propelled shows a substantial increase once the cilia start beating out - of - phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cilia_meta_results_flow ] ) . when the cilia spacing is large ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) , the flow generated remains approximately constant for all metachronal wave speeds .",
    "the increase in flow by decreasing the cilia spacing from @xmath121 to @xmath123 is much larger when the cilia beat out - of - phase compared to the increase when the cilia beat in - phase .",
    "however , when the cilia spacing is low ( @xmath115 ) , we see a larger increase in the fluid flow when there is an antiplectic metachrony(am ) compared to a symplectic metachrony ( sm ) .",
    "also , the effectiveness sharply increases from around 0.3 ( i.e. , 30% of the totally displaced fluid is converted into net flow ) to 1 ( fully unidirectional flow ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cilia_meta_results_effectiveness ] . to analyse these trends a bit further , we plot the positive and negative flow ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 in fig .  [",
    "fig : case3_meta_schematic ] ) created during a beat cycle for different phase differences in fig .  [ fig : cilia_meta_results_flow_positive_negative ] .",
    "it can be seen that the cilia do not create a negative flow when they beat out - of - phase for all cilia spacings , resulting in a unidirectional flow ( effectiveness = 1 ) .",
    "this reduction in negative flow is due to the shielding of flow during the recovery stroke caused by the effective flow of other cilia .",
    "it can also be noted that the positive flow is also reduced compared to in - phase beating , but the reduction is considerably less than the reduction in negative flow .",
    "thus , the net flow increases as soon as the cilia start to beat out - of - phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cilia_meta_results_flow ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cilia_meta_results_flow_positive_negative ] that in the presence of metachronal waves when the cilia spacing is large ( @xmath121 ) , the fluid transported during the effective stroke remains nearly the same for all values of the wave velocities . for small cilia spacing ( @xmath124 ) ,",
    "however , the positive flow is maximal for antiplectic metachrony , which leads to a larger net flow for antiplectic metachrony compared to symplectic metachrony .    to understand the difference in positive flow for opposite wave directions for small inter - cilium spacing ( @xmath115 ) , we plot the flux as a function of time scaled with the time taken by the magnetic couple to travel from one cilium to the next @xmath125 , for two different metachronal wave velocities ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 cilia per second ) , see fig .

    "it can be seen that the flux in the case of antiplectic metachrony is larger than the flux created by the symplectic metachrony for the same wave speed .",
    "this difference in flux for opposite wave directions can be understood by analysing the velocity field corresponding to symplectic and antiplectic metachrony at time instances when the flux is maximum ( see fig .",

    "the fifth cilium is in the peak of its effective stroke for both am and sm .    in the case of symplectic metachrony , the positive flow created by the fifth cilium is obstructed by the close proximity of the fourth cilium , which has just started its effective stroke . as a result , we observe the formation of a vortex . in the case of antiplectic metachrony , however , the position of the fourth cilium is such that the positive flow created by the fifth cilium is not obstructed .",
    "this leads to larger fluid flow in the positive direction , so that the net flow created by an antiplectic metachrony is larger than that created by its symplectic counterpart .",
    "reports on metachrony and phase locking of beating cilia have appeared in the past @xcite .",
    "the main results are that metachrony enhances flow compared to synchronously beating cilia @xcite and that antiplectic metachrony generates a higher flow rate than symplectic metachrony @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed two cilia , which are driven by internal motors and are moving out - of - phase due to the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "they have shown that the fluid propulsion increases , once the cilia start to beat with a phase difference , which is in agreement with our results .",
    "our results also agree with @xcite , where it is shown that the fluid flow is larger in the case of antiplectic metachrony than symplectic metachrony when the cilia are close together . however , our results differ from @xcite in the sense that we always see an enhancement in flow in the presence of metachrony ( compared to cilia beating in - phase ) irrespective of the direction and magnitude of the metachronal wave velocity .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the asymmetry in ciliary motion in our case is much higher .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed that the evolution of the out - of - phase motion of cilia in paramecia is due to hydrodynamic interactions between adjacent cilia leading to antiplectic metachrony .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the interplay between the internally - driven actuation and hydrodynamic interaction in nature results in antiplectic metachrony .",
    "our results , and those of others @xcite , show that indeed antiplectic metachrony leads to larger flow than symplectic metachrony for small cilia spacings as typically seen in nature .",
    "using a numerical model we have studied the flow created by a two - dimensional array of plate - like artificial cilia as a function of the phase lag and spacing between neighbouring cilia .",
    "the flow per cycle and the effectiveness ( which is a measure of the unidirectionality of flow ) are considerably enhanced when the cilia start beating out - of - phase , as compared to synchronously beating cilia . while the amount of flow enhancement depends on the inter - cilia spacing ,",
    "the effectiveness is not significantly influenced .",
    "metachrony is observed to completely knock - down the negative flow to zero due to the vortex formation caused by the shielding of the recovery stroke .",
    "interestingly , we find that the enhancement is achieved even for small phase differences .",
    "the direction of travel of the metachronal wave is important only for small cilia spacing . in that case , the flow is larger for antiplectic metachrony compared to symplectic metachrony , which is related to the obstruction of the positive flow for symplectic metachrony .",
    "it is therefore beneficial if the magnetic actuation of the artificial cilia is designed such that it results in an antiplectic metachrony .",
    "our results suggest that an antiplectic metachrony is adopted by the cilia on paramecia and in the respiratory system to maximize the fluid propelled . however , ciliary systems ( such as on opalina ) that exhibit symplectic metachrony are also present in nature .",
    "it will be of interest to investigate what property is optimised by symplectic metachrony in these systems .",
