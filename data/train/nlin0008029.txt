    "it is well known that chaos can not occur in continuous systems of total order less than three .",
    "this assertion is based on the usual concepts of order , such as the number of states in a system or the total number of separate differentiations or integrations in the system .",
    "the model of system can be rearranged to three single differential equations , where one of the equations contains the non - integer ( fractional ) order derivative .",
    "the total order of system is changed from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "to put this fact into context , we can consider the fractional - order dynamical model of the system .",
    "_ @xcite consider the fractional - order chua s system and demonstrated that chaos is possible for systems where the order is less than three",
    ". in their work , the limits on the mathematical order of the system to have a chaotic response , as measured from the bifurcation diagrams , are approximately from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . in work @xcite",
    ", chaos was discovered in fractional - order two - cell cellular neural networks and also in work @xcite chaos was exhibited in a system with total order less than three .    the control of chaos has been studied and observed in experiments ( e.g. works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "especially , the control of well - known chua s system @xcite by sampled data has been studied @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the control of chaos via sampled data is well - developed digital control techniques .    in this brief studies",
    "are presented practical results from sampled - data feed - back control of fractional - order chaotic dynamical system , modeled by the state equation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is state variable , @xmath7 is nonlinear function and @xmath8 .",
    "the approach used in this paper is concentrating on the feed - back control of the chaotic fractional - order chua s system , where total order of the system is @xmath9 .",
    "the idea of fractional calculus has been known since the development of the regular calculus , with the first reference probably being associated with leibniz and lhospital in 1695 .",
    "fractional calculus is a generalization of integration and differentiation to non - integer order fundamental operator @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the limits of the operation .",
    "the continuous integro - differential operator is defined as @xmath13 the two definitions used for the general fractional differintegral are the grnwald - letnikov ( gl ) definition and the riemann - liouville ( rl ) definition @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the rl definition is given as @xmath17 for @xmath18 and where @xmath19 is the _ gamma _ function .",
    "for numerical calculation of fractional - order derivation we can use the relation ( [ fd ] ) derived from the grnwald - letnikov definition ( [ gld_d ] ) .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that a wide class of functions , two definitions - gl ( [ gld_d ] ) and rl ( [ lrl ] ) - are equivalent .",
    "the relation for the explicit numerical approximation of @xmath20-th derivative at the points @xmath21 has the following form @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the `` memory length '' , @xmath24 is the step size of the calculation ( sample period ) and @xmath25 are binomial coefficients @xmath26 . for its calculation we can use the following expression : @xmath27      two general properties of fractional derivative",
    "we will be used .",
    "the first is composition of fractional with integer - order derivative and the second is the property of linearity .    the fractional - order derivative commutes with integer - order derivation @xcite , @xmath28 under the condition @xmath29 we have @xmath30 .",
    "the relationship ( [ kr ] ) says the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 commute .",
    "similar to integer - order differentiation , fractional differentiation is a linear operation @xcite : @xmath33",
    "classical chua s oscillator , which is shown in fig .",

    "\\frac{d i   } { dt } & = & \\frac{1}{l}\\left [ -v_2(t ) - r_l i \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the piecewise linear @xmath37 characteristic of nonlinear chua s diode .    given the techniques of fractional calculus , there are still a number of ways in which the order of system could be amended .",
    "one approach would be to change the order of any or all of tree constitutive equations ( [ chua_o ] ) so that the total order gave the desired value .    in our case , in the equation one",
    ", we replace the first differentiation by fractional differentiation of order @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the final dimensionless equations of the system for @xmath40 are @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the structure of control system with sampled data @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "the state variables of the chaotic system are measured and the result is used to construct the output signal @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a constant matrix .",
    "the output @xmath48 is then sampled by sampling block to obtain @xmath49 at the discrete moments @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and @xmath24 is the sample period .",
    "then @xmath52 is used by the controller to calculate the control signal @xmath53 , which is fed back into chaotic system .",

    "observe that since @xmath60 is an equilibrium point of the system ( [ cchs ] ) .",
    "the controlled fractional - order chua s system is defined by @xmath61",
    "for numerical simulations the following parameters of the fractional chua s system ( [ chua - hartley ] ) were chosen : @xmath62 and the following parameters ( experimentally found ) of controller : @xmath63 using the above parameters ( [ parameters_contrl ] ) the digital controller in state space form is defined as @xmath64 for @xmath65 the initial conditions for chua s circuit were @xmath66 = @xmath67 and the initial condition for the controller ( [ dc ] ) was @xmath68 = @xmath69 .",

    "the relations ( [ fd ] ) , ( [ b_k ] ) and properties ( [ commut ] ) , ( [ linear ] ) were used .",
    "the length of memory was @xmath71 ( @xmath72 coefficients for @xmath70 hz ) .",
    "3 shows the attractor of chua s circuit ( [ chua - hartley ] ) without control .",
    "similar behaviour was shown in work @xcite , where piecewise linear nonlinearity was replaced by cubic nonlinearity which yields very similar behaviour .    in fig .",
    "4 is shown the controlled trajectory of state variables of the fractional - order chua s system ( [ ccs ] ) , which tends to origin asymptotically .    in fig .",
    "5 is shown control signal from the digital controller ( [ dc ] ) .",
    "we have considered an example of control of chaotic fractional - order chua s circuit , which exhibits chaotic behaviour with total order less than three .",
    "as has been demonstrated , the idea of fractional calculus requires one to reconsider dynamic system concepts that are often taken for granted .",
    "so by decreasing the order of a system from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in this way , we also move from a three - dimensional system to one of infinite dimension .",
    "this system can be controlled by sampled data .",
    "the sampled data of output are sufficient for constructing the control signals in the digital controller .",
    "digital controllers had been widely used in industry .",
    "the conclusion of this work confirms the conclusions of the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that there is a need to refine the notion of the order of a system which can not be considered only by the total number of differentiation . for fractional - order differential equations the number of terms is more important than the order of differentiation .",
    "the results presented in this contribution give basis for controlling chaotic fractional - order systems .",
    "an alternative approximation of fractional - order derivative , stability investigation , and also other chaotic fractional - order system will be used in further work .",
