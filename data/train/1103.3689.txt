    "a wimp deposits energy in the noble liquid creating a primary scintillation light ( s1 ) .",

    "natural xenon contains the isotope @xmath12xe , which is predicted to undergo double beta decay , normally accompanied by the production of two neutrinos ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the detection of a peak in the summed energy of two electrons at 2.458 mev would represent the unequivocal signature of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath14 ) , proving that the neutrino is its own antiparticle ( a majorana particle )  @xcite .",

    "the ptfe housing was fully immersed in the liquid xenon allowing for the qupid to operate in single - phase mode .",
    "the temperature and pressure were held constant at -100@xmath1  c and 1.6 bar , and the system was operated under stable conditions for approximately two weeks . during this period , the xenon gas was purified with a hot metal getter in a closed recirculation loop .",
    "+ gain calibration of the qupid was performed by measuring its response to light from the picosecond laser , fed into the ptfe housing via an optical fiber .",

    "@xmath10po decays by a 5.3 mev @xmath32-particle , and from this a light yield of @xmath33 pe / kev was obtained with a resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "these measurements were taken on a different date than the @xmath9co data , and thus the conditions , such as xenon purity , changed between the data sets .",
    "+ the scintillation light from liquid xenon has two decay components due to the de - excitation of the singlet and triplet states of the excited dimer xe@xmath35  @xcite . the averaged pulse shape for @xmath10po @xmath32-particle and @xmath9co @xmath29-ray interactions , together with the fit of their overall decay profiles , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4plotpaperlog ] ( bottom ) .",

    "the @xmath9co pulses had a single decay time of @xmath38 ns .",
    "these decay time constants are similar to the previously published values of @xmath39 ns and @xmath40 ns for the @xmath32-particle fast and slow components , with a ratio of 69% fast and 31% slow , and to @xmath26 ns for @xmath29-interactions  @xcite .",
    "the ability to observe a difference in the pulse shapes of @xmath32-particle and @xmath29-ray interactions allows for the possibility of pulse shape discrimination in dark matter detectors .",
    "although the number of photoelectrons expected in a liquid xenon dark matter detector is too low for such discrimination , the technique can be applied to liquid argon detectors  @xcite .",

    "table  [ tab : summary ] shows a summary of the most relevant results .",
    "+ qupids have much lower radioactivity than conventional pmts as measured at the gator screening facility . simulations of ton scale detectors including qupids show that they satisfy the low background level requirement . the quantum efficiency , higher than 30% at the xenon scintillation wavelength , is competitive with standard photodetectors . a total gain of 10@xmath41 , and the capability of single photon counting ,",
    "fit very well with the detection of low intensity signals coming from wimp - nuclei interactions . a wide linear dynamic range , up to 3 ma of anode current at liquid xenon temperature , allows the qupid to cover an energy range large enough for neutrinoless double beta decay detection .",
    "we have measured the qupid uniformity to be above 80% over the entire surface , and have measured a good timing response of @xmath5  ns rise time , @xmath6  ns fall time , @xmath7  ns ( fwhm ) pulse width , and @xmath42  ps ( fwhm ) transit time spread . in a liquid xenon environment , we have demonstrated the qupids capability to detect scintillation light from @xmath29-ray and @xmath32-particle interactions .",
    "+ these characteristics make the qupid an ideal replacement for pmts in future experiments , such as darkside50 , xenon1ton , max , darwin , and xax  @xcite , and will represent a major contribution for the next generation of ton scale dark matter and double beta decay detectors .",
