    "selective modification of band gaps ( band - gap engineering ) by atomic - scale design of materials is a powerful concept in electronic and photonic development.@xcite band gaps can be altered by , for example , introducing dopants , defects or by exploiting finite size effects.@xcite the physical origin of band - gap variations is a modification in the charge distribution in concert with wavefunction hybridization and modification .",
    "dispersive or van der waals ( vdw ) interactions@xcite also alter the distribution of electronic charges and hence the electron band - structure .",
    "a _ direct effect _ is evident , for example , by considering the formation of the double - dipole configuration@xcite which is the electrostatic signature and inherent nature of a pure vdw binding.@xcite in addition , there are also _ indirect , geometry - induced effects _ of vdw binding on electron behavior .",
    "these indirect effects arise when two material fragments come close to one another , thereby changing the local electron environments as compared to isolated fragments .",
    "for example , vdw - binding can cause smaller amounts of net charge transfer within individual vdw - bonded fragments.@xcite also , wavefunction hybridization will certainly arise when material fragments approach one another , even if this hybridization does not significantly contribute to the binding itself ( in purely dispersive interaction ) .",
    "wavefunction hybridization and pauli exclusion cause scattering of the surface - state electrons in physiosorption of acenes and quinones on cu@xmath4 , even if there is no net charge transfer.@xcite    the strength of vdw interactions in surface / adatom systems ( including adclusters or complete overlayers ) can be controlled by the precise choice of the surface material@xcite and by the surface morphology ( flat , stepped , pyramidal , _",
    "etc._).@xcite it is therefore important to quantify the extent to which van der waals ( vdw ) bonding can modify the electron dispersion , that is , the band structure .",
    "such a study is now possible , since recent development of the vdw density functional ( vdw - df ) method @xcite enables systematic ( theoretical ) explorations of bonding in sparse materials within density functional theory ( dft).@xcite    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "the most pronounced electronic difference between bulk graphane and ml or bl graphane is the fact that the a point takes over the role of the @xmath5 point , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bs1 ] . at a",
    ", the band gap is smallest in the bulk and the size of that gap coincides essentially with the size of the gap at @xmath5 in the ml or bl .",
    "also , in the bulk , the deviations in the band - gap variations can be considerably larger than those in the bl , see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bs1 ] . here , we give a more detailed analysis of the overall band structure effects associated with graphane assembly into bulk .    in the the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bs3 ] , we show the band diagram along @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "focusing on the cb , the bulk band structure is very different from that of the bl along the same path , see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bs1 ] . in particular at the @xmath5 point , that gap is approximately twice as large as in the bl .",
    "also , the band energy at k is considerably higher than in the bl . only at m",
    ", we find similar band energies .",
    "thus , the effect of vdw - bonding on local features of the band structure and related observable properties can be dramatic .    in the mid - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bs3 ] , we show show the band diagram along @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . again , the the bulk band structure is very different from that of the bl along the parallel path along @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . the band energy at h is lower than at l , while it is the other way around at k and at m in the bl . only around the @xmath12 point (",
    "corresponding to @xmath5 in the bl and ml cases ) do the bulk and ml band diagram show similar features .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bs3 ] , we effectively combine the two diagrams from the left and mid - panel , calculating the band diagram for a would - be 2-layer unit cell at @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting band diagram shows the features of the bl band diagram and of the vb there is also a very good quantitative agreement .",
    "therefore , the bl band - diagram can partly be understood as a zone - folded version of the bulk band - diagram .",
    "this paper predicts and characterizes band - structure modifications produced indirectly as a geometry - induced effect of pure dispersive binding between two macromolecules in possible new material systems : bilayer and bulk graphane.@xcite using non - selfconsistent vdw - df calculations,@xcite we determine the binding separation ( @xmath14-lattice parameter ) and binding energies in vdw - bonded graphane bilayers ( bulk ) .",
    "we use the calculated separations to obtain corresponding gga - dft band diagrams .",
    "our results demonstrate that vdw interactions can significantly alter electron behavior , at least locally in the brillouin zone . in graphane ,",
    "the direct band gap is reduced ( increased ) by up to 1.2  ev ( 4  ev ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the origin of the band - gap modifications in this system is the concerted action of two geometry - induced effects .",
    "the first cause is the hybridization between _ unoccupied _ wave functions in the lowest conduction band .",
    "this effect generally leads to lower ( higher ) energy state for the bonding - type ( antibonding - type ) hybrid wave function , but not always , since the graphane wavefunctions can possess a more complex hybridization nature than what applies in the hydrogen - like case .",
    "the second cause is the modified electrostatic interaction between the hybrid wave functions and the electron density .",
    "this cause can either increase or decrease the energy gain ( loss ) in a bonding - type ( antiboning - type ) hybridization .",
    "moreover , it may result into a modified hybrid wave - function where a pure bonding - type ( antibonding - type ) character is lost .",
    "our analysis also shows that selfconsistent charge rearrangements ( on the gga level ) with respect to the ml density have no significant impact on the bandstructure .",
    "additional charge rearrangements described by self - consistent vdw - df calculations@xcite are expected to be even smaller , justifying our use of non - selfconsistent vdw - df .",
    "the nature of conduction and optical absorption in bl graphane would be determined by the region around the @xmath5 point .",
    "there , the band structure of the bilayer essentially coincides with that of the monolayer .",
    "therefore , we expect graphane multilayers to behave electronically similar to a graphane monolayer , at least for properties defined by a simple response . for bulk graphane ,",
    "the behavior is more complicated .",
    "we emphasize that other vdw - bonded systems may exist where significant band - gap modifications arise at brillouin - zone points having higher relevance for the electronic nature of the material .",
    "our results for bl graphane suggest that vdw forces can have non - negligible _ indirect _ effects on the overall band structure in layered or macromolecular materials . a similar effect can be found in v2o5,@xcite where traditional gga severely overestimate the @xmath14 lattice constant and where vdw - df provides a more accurate description.@xcite furthermore",
    ", we notice that vdw binding of the intrinsic semimetal graphene to metal@xcite or semiconductor@xcite surfaces seems to generally lead to a shift of the fermi level , rendering graphene a true metal . these observations together with the fact that the vdw binding strength in surface / adatom systems ( and thus presumably the strength of the corresponding effect on the band structure ) depends on the choice of the substrate material@xcite and on the substrate morphology@xcite implies a possibility to exploit dispersive interactions also in band - gap engineering",
    ".    finally , a comment on the accuracy of the predicted band - gap modifications is in order .",
    "gga dft typically severely underestimates the band gap in semiconductors or insulators .",
    "a possible remedy is the use of the gw method where the kohn - sham orbitals are used to construct the self - energy operator .",
    "the gw method also contains non - local correlations and therefore provides an alternative description of vdw interaction .",
    "gw calculations come at a considerably higher computational cost than that of vdw - df , however .",
    "the procedure illustrated here , using vdw - df calculations to determine binding morphologies followed by band - structure calculations might well also be adapted for gw , pursuing characterizations of band - structure effects in sparse matter .",

    "the displaced configurations essentially do not relax , reflecting the essentially flat pbe pes at these separations . however , adding the nonlocal vdw correction by evaluating eq .",
