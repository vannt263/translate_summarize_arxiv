    "co oxides have been the objective of deep research during the last few years . as any correlated oxide",
    ", they present an interplay between the electronic structure , magnetic properties and geometric structure that makes them very interesting from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view .",
    "they have received a strong attention very recently , mainly after the discovery of both superconductivity@xcite and magnetoresistance@xcite in them because of the vast technological applications of those phenomena , but also because of the magnetic transitions accompanied of structural transitions , that are not yet fully understood .",
    "gdbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 presents magnetic transitions at about 75 and 220 k and a metal - insulator transition at some 360 k.@xcite the magnetization measurements at the different phases have not been conclusively ascribed to a particular spin state and orbital configuration .",
    "there are no measurements available of the orbital magnetic moments of the co ions in the different phases and spin states .",
    "this rich variety of phases including spin state transitions occurs in co@xmath2 compounds , where the low - spin state is not stable at all temperatures because of the small magnitude of the crystal field , comparable to the intra - atomic exchange energy .",
    "this is the case of gdbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 , that also presents giant magnetoresistance@xcite associated with a metal - insulator transition .",
    "very recently , a spin blockade phenomenon has been found to explain its conduction properties.@xcite some work has also been carried out from a theoretical standpoint.@xcite the goal of this paper is to make use of electronic structure calculations in order to explain the magnetic and electronic structure of the compound and their variations with respect to the magnetic and spin state transitions that occur in it .",
    "for doing so , in section [ strsec ] we will describe the structure of the material and the method of calculation and in section [ elecsec ] we will present our calculations of the magnetic and electronic structure , dealing with the spin state , magnetic and metal - insulator transitions , and also with the orbital ordering phenomenon relating all of these to the macroscopic observations establishing a consistent picture for the observed properties of the material .",
    "o@xmath1 . grey atoms ( co1 and co2 ) are co@xmath3 , dark atoms ( co3 and co4 ) are co@xmath4 and the small light ones are the oxygen atoms .",
    "observe the oxygen vacants along the c - axis leading to a square pyramidal environment . ]",
    "gdbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 presents two crystallographically different surroundings for the two inequivalent co ions in the unit cell .",
    "one of them is in a square pyramidal ( co@xmath3 ) and the other in an octahedral environment ( co@xmath4 ) .",
    "there is one oxygen vacant per unit cell , that produces the square pyramidal environment for the co in the crystallographic position 2r .",
    "the octahedron surrounding co@xmath4 is elongated along the @xmath5-axis ( see fig .",
    "[ strfig ] for the naming of the crystallographic directions ) .",
    "the unit cell is orthorhombic with space group pmmm .",
    "the value of the lattice parameters and atomic positions were taken from respaud _ _ et al.__@xcite ( @xmath5= 3.87738  , b= 7.53487    and c= 7.8269  ) , but the oxygen positions were recalculated performing a full structural relaxation .",
    "it is well established that the oxygen vacants are in the crystallographic position 1 g ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2).@xcite for our calculations we broke the symmetry along the b - axis , so that 4 inequivalent co atoms enter the cell ( let us call co1 and co2 the two inequivalent atoms in the pyramidal position and co3 and co4 the two inequivalent atoms in the octahedral environment , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ strfig ] ) .",
    "further symmetry breakings were produced along the c- and @xmath5-axis to have 8 co atoms in the supercell : the former case with the intention of studying possible spin state orderings in the @xmath6 plane and the latter for analyzing the magnetic couplings between co@xmath3 layers mediated by a plane of co@xmath4 atoms .",
    ".crystallographic positions at t= 0 that result from our structure optimization . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     a summary of the oam calculated is presented in table [ taboam ] .",
    "these data are calculated assuming the magnetization goes along the experimental easy axis ( @xmath7-axis ) .",
    "the values are given inside the muffin - tin spheres , so the real values of the moments are , hence , somewhat bigger ( about 10 - 30% , but this is difficult to estimate ) .",
    "they also are u - dependent by up to 25% for other combinations of u parameters within a reasonable range .",
    "large values up to 0.6 @xmath8 for some of the co atoms would be consistent with our calculations .",
    "experimental measurements are needed to confirm this observation .",
    "we performed these calculations for the three different spin state configurations we could converge for the co@xmath4 atoms ( co@xmath3 is always in an is state ) : a ls , an is state and a spin state ordering with half the co@xmath4 atoms in a hs state and the other half in a ls state .",
    "irrespective of the co@xmath4 spin state , we observe that co@xmath3 atoms have very similar angular momenta ( one of them being about 0.3 @xmath8 inside the muffin - tin sphere ) . the electronic structure of these atoms barely changes when a spin state transition occurs to co@xmath4 .",
    "this atom develops a big angular momentum in one of the sites when it is in an is state .",
    "it is worth noting that the big orbital angular momentum occurs when the hole in the t@xmath9 multiplet is left in the @xmath10 orbital , both in the case of co@xmath3 and co@xmath4 in an is state , whereas the configuration with a hole in a different t@xmath9 orbital produces a negligible moment .",
    "small values are predicted also for co@xmath4 in a ls sate .",
    "these are oppositely oriented to the magnetic moment of the co@xmath3 ions when all the co@xmath4 atoms are in a ls state and parallel to them when the layer includes co@xmath4 atoms in a hs state .",
    "these also have a large value of the oam , but smaller than those of the is state .",
    "we also performed calculations of the magnetic anisotropy energies and our results agree with the experimental data available.@xcite we obtain a strong ising - like behavior for the afi phase ( is - ls with is co@xmath3 planes coupled af via nonmagnetic co@xmath4 layers ) . in that case , the c - axis is the easy axis by some 150 k / co , a big anisotropy energy , in agreement with the experimental value ( some 80 - 100 k / co).@xcite for the is - ls fmi phase , we find an easy axis along the c - axis , being the b - direction almost degenerate ( 3 k / co harder ) and the @xmath5-direction harder by some 40 k / co .",
    "no trace of ising - like behavior is found for this phase .",
    "this disagrees with the experimental findings because our zero - temperature dft calculations can not describe appropriately the magnetic anisotropy properties at 260 k , where they have been measured.@xcite a similar situation occurs for the is - is fm state , the b - axis is the easy axis being the a and c directions harder by some 30 k / co . in these cases",
    "it could be possible that the domain formation found in ref .",
    "could have an influence on the value of the magnetic anisotropy constants that is not considered in the calculation of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the co oxide gdbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 using _ ab initio _ calculations considering an all - electron , full - potential apw+lo method .",
    "the points we tried to address were the spin state transitions , the orbital ordering and spin - orbit effects ( unquenched orbital angular momenta and magnetic anisotropy properties ) . from our calculations",
    "we confirm the stability of the is state for co@xmath3 or the conduction properties of the is - ls state as a narrow gap insulator .",
    "the transition to a metallic phase must be accompanied of a spin state transition of co@xmath4 .",
    "it is necessary to know the precise geometry in the metallic phase to determine its spin and magnetic configuration .",
    "we have observed the material is in an orbitally - ordered state both at low temperatures in the is - ls state and also in a hypothetical is - is state , and we described the orbitals involved in the phenomenon .",
    "we also predict big unquenched orbital angular momenta for some of the co atoms in the structure , a fact that had been predicted but whose values have never been measured .",
    "we estimate their values and explain their origin . also , the magnetic anisotropy was studied and agrees with the experimental observation of a strong ising - like behavior . in summary , we establish a consistent picture for the properties of the material by confirming some experimental evidences and predicting new results based on first principles calculations .",
