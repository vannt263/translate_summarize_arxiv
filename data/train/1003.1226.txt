    "the height of the barrier decreases monotonically.,width=302 ]    the height of the barrier is given by @xmath183 and is directly proportional to the intensity of the lasers .",
    "figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows the dependence of @xmath184 on the parameter @xmath176 for different values of @xmath84 and fixed laser intensity @xmath158 w / m@xmath90 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath184 for different @xmath84 is qualitatively very similar : the height of the barrier decreases with increasing @xmath176 monotonically . for fixed @xmath176 ,",
    "a more narrow laser entails a more shallow double well . since the range of @xmath176 is determined by the condition @xmath172 , a more narrow laser necessitates furthermore tighter magnetic traps , i.e. , smaller @xmath176 .",
    "note that the positions of the minima do not depend on the intensity of the lasers .",
    "thus , by increasing the laser intensities one can increase the height of the barrier without changing the position of the minima . in this way , the number of trapped states in each well can be controlled .",
    "one can use the same semi - analytical procedure as above in order to predict the effective potential for a single laser .",
    "one finds @xmath185 where @xmath186 .",
    "the comparison of the effective potential ( [ eq : v^1_eff ] ) and the corresponding numerical solutions shows again an excellent agreement . as opposed to the raman setup involving two lasers , in the case of a single laser",
    "the resulting trapping potential for the @xmath93 component is rotationally symmetric .",
    "the ring - shaped minimum is located at @xmath187 and exists for @xmath188 . starting at a barrier with arbitrarily small width with maximal height for @xmath175 , the barrier at the origin gets lower as @xmath176 increases and eventually vanishes as @xmath189 .",
    "the distance of the minimum to the origin increases with @xmath176 up to the local maximum at @xmath190 with a value @xmath191 .",
    "then it decreases again and becomes zero at @xmath192 thereby transforming the potential into a single well .",
    "note that the potential is not a simple superposition of a magnetic single well potential and a repulsive potential created by the laser .",
    "the spatial structure is a direct consequence of the spatially dependent light shift potential of the laser , giving rise to a barrier which is smaller than the width of the laser .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that for appropriate parameters the discussed combination of external fields leads to a confinement for two components of the ground state manifold .",
    "let us discuss in this section possible loss mechanism for these potentials .",
    "one loss channel results from the coupling of the ground manifold of states to the excited @xmath69 states .",
    "despite the fact that the raman lasers are detuned with respect to the excited state , there is a finite probability to excite the atom to this state due to the width of the state and the width of the lasers .",
    "the excited atom can subsequently decay spontaneously to the untrapped ground state .",
    "the resulting lifetime of the dressed state can be estimated by applying perturbation theory , leading to @xmath193 with @xmath194 being the lifetime of the unperturbed excited state and @xmath195 the coupling matrix element of the ground state to the excited state . for our parameters ( @xmath88 , @xmath196 w / m@xmath90 , and @xmath197 ns ) we get an effective lifetime of @xmath198 ms .",
    "the latter can be increased by decreasing the intensities of the lasers .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that this will reduce the depth of the trapping potentials as well .",
    "another loss mechanism occurs if more than one atom is loaded into the potential due to the mutual interaction of the atoms .",
    "this mechanism can be estimated on a mean field level , incorporating an effective coupling coefficient that determines the interaction between the atoms . in the field - free case one",
    "gets a population transfer from one component to another due to interaction when there is an overlap between the wave functions of two components . for our setup , however , one obtains new dressed states that are superpositions of the field - free states .",
    "hence , one obtains a state changing contribution due to interaction even if only one dressed state is occupied .",
    "however , for the above discussed parameters this additional term can be neglected .",
    "we investigated the trapping potentials for @xmath5rb ground state atoms simultaneously exposed to a magnetic trap in a ioffe - pritchard like configuration and an optical trap in a raman setup .",
    "the raman lasers were detuned between the two excited @xmath69 hyperfine states , the @xmath83 and the @xmath163 state . by varying the offset field of the ioffe - pritchard trap",
    ", we demonstrated that the trapping potential of the @xmath93 component can be tuned from a rotationally symmetric single well to a double well trap ; in the intermediate regime , one finds a cigar shaped trapping potential . by applying a phase difference between the two raman lasers ,",
    "the resulting trapping potentials can be rotated about the propagation direction of the laser beams .",
    "a semi - analytical formula for the potential surfaces has been derived .",
    "all relevant properties of the double well potential have been determined analytically as a function of the various trap parameters . for a single excitation laser ,",
    "the proposed scheme results in a ring - shaped trap for the @xmath93 component .    in order to exploit the unique features of the above discussed potentials",
    ", one can think of various experiments .",
    "for example , one might trap the @xmath93 component in a double well potential which gives for the @xmath80 component a single well potential located at the center of the barrier . for an asymmetric occupation of the wells one",
    "can then observe tunneling of atoms trapped in the double well potential through the atoms trapped in the single well potential .",
    "the oscillation frequency of the tunneling can thus be investigated as a function of the occupation number of the second component located at the barrier , which is reminiscent of a single atom transistor @xcite .",
    "we performed corresponding numerical simulations of the spinor gross pitaevskii equation and observed indeed an increase of the oscillation period with increasing occupation number of the second component .    in a similar setup",
    "as mentioned above ( one component is exposed to a a double well potential with a narrow barrier and one component to single well potential centered at the position of the barrier ) one might trap atoms in the component exposed to the single well potential and then transfer all atoms by an rf - pulse in the `` double - well '' component that feels a sharp potential maximum at this point . depending on the energy of the atoms the condensate wave function",
    "would consequently either split into two parts or the whole wave function would move into one direction , which could be used as a test of the validity of the gross pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the possibility to rotate an anisotropic single well trap ( which arises for the @xmath80 component ) opens up a new possibility to study superfluids under rotation @xcite . the possibility to rotate",
    "the double well potential allows one to create an effective ring potential by rotating the potential fast enough so that the atoms feel a time averaged potential @xcite . in this way the transition of a double well to a ring - shaped potential can be investigated",
    "moreover , one can exploit the feature that one can drive the potential surface of the @xmath93 component by modulating the ioffe field strength to investigate non - equilibrium driven systems @xcite .    as an extension to the present work",
    ", it would be interesting to extend the studies to different propagation directions of the laser beams with respect to the orientation of the magnetic trap .",
    "furthermore , one can vary the shape of one or both laser beams by using excited modes .",
