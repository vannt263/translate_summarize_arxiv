    "experiments on thin granular films show a zero temperature superconductor to insulator ( si ) phase transition as a function of the film thickness  @xcite or magnetic field  @xcite , and experiments on josephson junction arrays ( jja ) exhibit the same si transition as a function of the ratio between josephson coupling and charging energy  @xcite .",
    "these findings are interpreted in terms of a bosonic model  @xcite in which the competition between the hopping of cooper pairs and the coulomb interaction between them is responsible for the si transition . in relation to the effect of disorder on the si transition a bose - glass phase",

    "@xcite .",
    "an interesting extension of the minimal model with on - site interaction only is to account for finite - range interactions , which are present in josephson junction arrays and @xmath0he - films on substrates in two dimensions , and bulk @xmath0he in three dimensions .",
    "artificially fabricated jja s are ideal model systems to study the superconductor to mott - insulator transition as a function of the coupling constants or magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the finite range of the interaction in these systems leads to commensurability and frustration effects .",
    "furthermore , coexistence phases may appear that are called supersolids . in these phases a charge - density wave ( cdw ) that is stabilized by the interaction may coexist with superfluidity . in other words",
    "the system has diagonal long - range order ( lro ) and off - diagonal lro at the same time .",
    "the supersolid phase was studied in the early seventies after andreev and lifshitz  @xcite suggested that vacancies in a quantum crystal such as @xmath0he might bose - einstein condense at low temperatures without destroying the crystal structure , thereby establishing a superfluid solid  @xcite , or supersolid .",
    "normally bosons at zero temperature are either superfluid ( with off - diagonal lro ) or solid ( with diagonal lro ) . however , for a finite range of the interactions between the bosons a coexistence phase was predicted within mean - field approximations  @xcite .",
    "experiments have been performed on @xmath1he , but no positive identification of this coexistence phase has yet been made .",
    "there are , however , hints towards such a phase @xcite .",

    "@xcite and a coexistence phase of superfluidity and hexatic orientational order was proposed in ref .",
    "orientational order in incompressible quantum hall fluids is discussed in ref .",
    "collinear supersolids were studied in refs .",

    "both the si transition and the supersolid phase will be studied in some detail . in the next section",
    "several related models for interacting bosons will be discussed , of which the bose - hubbard model is the most general . in the limit of infinite on - site interaction the bose - hubbard model",
    "reduces to the spin @xmath3 xxz model . for a large number of bosons per lattice site the quantum - phase model is applicable .",

    "more accurate results for the phase diagram will be obtained by means of quantum monte carlo .",
    "part of the data has already been published as ref .",
    "finally the paper closes with a discussion of the various results in section  [ sec - d ] .",
    "a convenient starting point for the description of interacting lattice bosons is the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the creation and annihilation operators for bosons that satisfy the commutation relation @xmath6=\\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath7 is the number operator .",
    "the first term describes the density - density interaction between the bosons",

    "the second term describes the coupling of the density to a chemical potential , and the third describes the hopping from site to site with hopping integral @xmath11 .",
    "the first two terms will cause the bosons to be localized if the interaction dominates over the hopping . in the opposite case where the hopping dominates the bosons will form a superfluid",
    ".    in the limit of large on - site interaction @xmath8 , only the states with 0 and 1 boson per lattice site survive , and by identifying @xmath12 and @xmath13 the mapping to the spin @xmath3 xxz hamiltonian is obtained .",

    "this hamiltonian has been investigated extensively on the mean - field level for nearest - neighbor as well as next nearest - neighbor interactions .    in the limit of a large number of bosons per lattice site",
    "one may parameterize @xmath16 and take @xmath17 equal to the boson density .",
    "thus , only the phase remains as a dynamic variable and the quantum - phase hamiltonian reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the phase and number are canonical conjugate variables and satisfy @xmath20=i\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "this is exactly the hamiltonian for josephson junction arrays with an applied gate voltage in order to tune the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a parameter @xmath21 , which allows us to rewrite the coulomb interaction and chemical potential term in eqs .",
    "( [ bh ] ) and ( [ qp ] ) as @xmath22 we expect that the properties of the quantum - phase model will be periodic in the variable @xmath23 with period 1 .",
    "a first insight into the properties of these models may be gained by considering their mean - field solutions . the mean - field approximation for the spin model in eq .",
    "( [ xxz ] ) is straightforward and was carried out by various authors @xcite .",
    "the question of a supersolid phase in this model was first addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite and investigated further in ref .",
    "we review the spin mean - field theory in subsect .",
    "[ subsec - smf ] .",

    "mean - field approaches to the bose - hubbard model have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but to our present knowledge there exists no mean - field approximation for the bose - hubbard model which allows for the identification of a supersolid phase .    in sect .",
    "[ sec - vm ] we present a variational ansatz for the many - body wave function that allows the three models to be treated on an equal footing .",
    "this is important , as it allows for a comparison between the models on the same level of approximation .",
    "since we use a factorizable ansatz for the wave function , it also has mean - field character .",
    "the validity of the mean - field approximation in two dimensions is often limited , since the lower critical dimension for models with continuous symmetries is two , which is the dimension we are particularly interested in .",
    "this is a serious problem at finite temperature where the models do not even exhibit superfluid long - range order as formulated in the theorem of mermin and wagner , and hohenberg  @xcite .",
    "useful results may , however , be gained from mean - field approximations at zero temperature where quantum dynamics formally adds an extra dimension , the imaginary time axis .",
    "the systems then do have long - range order and mean - field results may be qualitatively correct .",
    "this will be shown in the present article by scaling arguments and confirmed by the monte carlo simulations . in the remainder of this section we present the different mean - field type approaches .",
    "the spin mean - field theory can be formulated by linearizing the spin - spin interaction .",
    "this yields the standard self - consistency equations for the magnetization @xmath24 where the subscript @xmath25 refers to the sublattice and @xmath26 is the inverse temperature ( we use units in which @xmath27 ) . in order to identify spatially varying solutions one needs to introduce several sublattices , at least three for interactions including nearest and next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the symmetry in the @xmath28-plane reduces the number of independent variables and most of the phase boundaries can be determined analytically .",
    "if we allow for three different sublattices ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , the effective field is given by @xmath32 and corresponding equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "a staggered magnetization in @xmath37-direction implies a solid ( charge - density wave ) ordering of the bosons .",
    "finite magnetization in @xmath28-direction translates into off - diagonal lro for the boson model .",
    "the coexistence phase of both types of lro is the supersolid phase for the bosons .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ spinfig ] for @xmath38 .",
    "two different types of solid ordering occur for different chemical potential , i.e. , @xmath39 ordering around half - filling , and additional @xmath40 and @xmath41 ordering around quarter filling .",
    "now we turn to the mean - field treatment of soft - core bosons following refs .  @xcite . after decoupling the hopping and the interactions between the different sites in eq .",
    "( [ qp ] ) , one arrives at a local problem @xmath42 with the @xmath43-periodic solutions for the wave function in the phase representation @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 . after these substitutions the following mathieu equation for @xmath47",

    "( [ sc ] ) .",
    "the numerical solution of this set of equations is straightforward . in order to allow for spatially varying solutions we again define sublattices .",
    "our numerical solutions confirm the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , some details differ .    for on - site interaction",
    "we obtain mott insulating lobes centered around integer values @xmath52 of @xmath53 , see fig .",
    "[ mottfig ] . in these incompressible lobes",
    "the density is pinned to @xmath52 . at half",
    "integer values of @xmath53 the critical value of the hopping vanishes , due to the degeneracy in energy of states with @xmath52 and @xmath54 particles per site .    including nearest - neighbor interaction the calculation has to be performed on two sublattices .",
    "we obtain two different kinds of insulating lobes , one with integer filling and homogeneous density , another with half - integer filling and a checkerboard charge - density wave , or solid order , centered around half integer values of @xmath53 .",
    "in addition we find a region of supersolid phase around the half lobe where the checkerboard charge - density wave and superfluidity coexist , see fig .",
    "[ cbssfig ] .",
    "again , the superfluid phase occupies the parts on the right of the phase diagram and also between the insulating lobes down to zero hopping , in slight contrast to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fraction of supersolid phase in the phase diagram depends on the ratio @xmath55 , see fig .",
    "[ numbfig ] . in the hard - core limit",
    "@xmath56 the supersolid phase vanishes .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ numbfig ] shows @xmath59 at @xmath23=0.5 as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "the figure indicates that double occupancy is important for the supersolid phase .",
    "thus , we conclude that the supersolid phase is favored by fluctuations in the particle number .",
    "the inclusion of further interactions leads to more structure in the phase diagram . for next - nearest neighbor interaction",
    "we introduce three sublattices . as a result",
    ", the phase diagram shows a lobe with quarter filling and a phase where this quarter structure and superconductivity coexist , see fig .  [ nnnfig ] .",
    "the previous subsections showed two extreme cases of the bose - hubbard model , the hard - core limit and the limit of large particle numbers .",
    "although the phase diagrams look similar , these two limits behave qualitatively different as far as the supersolid phase is concerned .    in the hard - core limit the existence of the supersolid",
    "is related to a finite next - nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the supersolid does not exist in the model including nearest - neighbor interaction only  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is no supersolid phase at exactly half filling .",
    "this leads to the following interpretation of the supersolid phase . at densities corresponding to half filling the particles form an incompressible solid .",
    "away from half filling superfluidity is enabled by defects in the solid structure that bose - einstein condense .",
    "this interpretation does , however , not explain why next - nearest neighbor interaction is necessary for the formation of the supersolid .    in the limit of many particles per site the quantum - phase model applies .",
    "in this case the supersolid phase already exists for nearest - neighbor interaction only and at half filling .",
    "this is related to excitations which are forbidden in the hard - core limit .",
    "we observe that a large nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath9 or small on - site interaction @xmath8 favors the supersolid , in the hard - core limit the supersolid is suppressed . in the soft - core limit",
    "the supersolid phase is also present at half - filling at the tip of the checkerboard lobe .",
    "thus , it seems that the system itself generates the defects ( particle - hole excitations ) that bose condense , thereby turning the solid into the supersolid .",
    "here we present a method which allows us to treat the three models within one scheme  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to guess a variational wave function for the problem @xcite .",
    "we use a variational wave function that is inspired by earlier successful gutzwiller - like treatments of the spin model  @xcite and the bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the occupation number representation is well suited for all three models .",
    "explicitly we resolve the identity as @xmath61 and express the trace as @xmath62 where the @xmath63 are in @xmath64 $ ] for the spin @xmath3 xxz model , in @xmath65 $ ] for the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model , and in @xmath66 $ ] for the quantum - phase ( qp ) model .",
    "besides the difference in the allowed values of @xmath63 , the matrix elements differ for the three models , e.g. , @xmath67 as our variational wave function we take the product of single - site wave functions .",
    "this amounts to neglecting certain correlations and is therefore similar to a mean - field approximation .",
    "we use the following ansatz @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are real variational parameters .",
    "the single - site wave function is a superposition of boson number eigenstates weighted with a gaussian .",

    "figure  [ qpvarfig ] shows the phase diagram for the qp model with on - site and nearest - neighbor interaction obtained with our variational ansatz .",
    "both the superfluid - insulator and the crystalline order transition can be identified and agree with previous mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "the phase boundaries are periodic in @xmath23 .",
    "we find that superfluidity sets in simultaneously on both sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath30 . within the supersolid phase the value of the superconducting order parameter on @xmath29 differs from that on @xmath30 , but",
    "both are nonzero . beyond the crystalline order phase boundary",
    "the order parameter does not exhibit any difference on the sublattices .    for the xxz model",
    "the variational method confirms that there is no supersolid for on - site and nearest - neighbor interaction only . in the presence of next - nearest neighbor interaction we find supersolid phases in perfect agreement with @xcite and fig .",

    "the size of the lobes decreases with increasing @xmath53 . at point",
    "@xmath83 the supersolid vanishes .",
    "this might be due to the lower bound for the occupation numbers @xmath84 . for small @xmath53 charge fluctuations",
    "are suppressed .",
    "hence , we conclude that charge fluctuations are necessary for the supersolid . for large @xmath23 the phase boundaries of the qp model approach those of the bh model , if the hopping is rescaled according to section  [ sec - tmh ] , i.e. , if @xmath11 and @xmath85 are identified .",
    "several methods are available for determining the phase diagram for the three model hamiltonians by numerical means .",
    "exact diagonalization is possible for the xxz model and small systems , i.e. , less than about 26 lattice sites .",

    "for @xmath23=0.1 , 0.2 and 0.4 we obtain @xmath171 for the superfluid transition . in order to keep the ratio @xmath139 constant ,",
    "we simulated @xmath188 systems , where @xmath121= 6 , 8 , 10 . for @xmath23=0.4 near the transition for the diagonal lro we performed the calculations with both @xmath159 and @xmath171 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ dat2fig ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : zdisc ] and table [ table - nn ] . in the following we discuss our data in detail .",
    "first we present our data for @xmath23=0.5 .",
    "figure [ dat2fig ] shows that there are two separate transitions for diagonal and off - diagonal lro with a coexistence region in between where _ both _ the superfluid density _ and _ the structure factor scale to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this demonstrates the coexistence of diagonal lro and off diagonal lro for soft - core bosons with nearest - neighbor interaction in 2 dimensions .",
    "table  [ table - nn ] shows that the exponent @xmath148 is different for the two transitions . for the transition related to superfluidity ( point @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ cbssfig ] ) we find @xmath189 which is consistent with the 3d xy universality class . for the transition related to crystalline order ( point @xmath190 ) the universality class is not known .",
    "we find @xmath1910.55 and @xmath1920.21 .    also at @xmath23=0.4 we find two separate transitions that are the boundaries for the supersolid phase in between , see table [ table - nn ] . as compared to @xmath23=0.5 both transitions are shifted to smaller values of the coupling constant @xmath146 .",
    "this is consistent with the mean - field phase diagram .",
    "again the two transitions have different critical exponents . the transition related to superfluidity ( the line separating phases `` sol '' and `` ssol '' in fig .  [ cbssfig ] ) has @xmath193 which is consistent with a mean - field transition in @xmath194 effective dimensions . for the transition related to crystalline order ( between phases `` ssol '' and `` sf '' )",
    "we compare the data for @xmath171 and @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdisc ] .",
    "a fit to the expected scaling behavior is equally possible in both cases .",
    "the statistical errors of the data for @xmath171 are larger , since the simulation for @xmath171 requires larger @xmath135 ( up to 25 ) which decreases the acceptance ratio for periodic loops in this direction .",
    "the values for the critical coupling and the critical exponents for both @xmath159 and @xmath171 are shown in table [ table - nn ] , they coincide within the error bars . with the values of table  [ table - nn ]",
    "the scaling relation @xmath195 leads to @xmath196 , with correlation function exponent @xmath197 ( small and usually positive ) .",
    "this rules out @xmath171 and one is led to conclude that indeed @xmath198 for the crystalline transition , independent of @xmath23 .    the small value of @xmath26 rules out mean - field behavior for the cdw transition .",
    "insight into the nature of this transition is gained by the following consideration . in the neighborhood of this transition ,",
    "i.e. , far in the superfluid phase , the x , y - components of the currents @xmath199 fluctuate strongly and may be integrated out as gaussian fluctuations .",
    "in other words : one expects the staggered magnetization order parameter to couple to the gapless 4@xmath200 sound mode of the superfluid .",
    "this yields strong long - range interactions in the time direction for the @xmath201-components of the currents @xmath199 .",
    "it is likely that these long - range interactions are a relevant perturbation and suppress the exponent @xmath26 .    finally , we discuss the data for @xmath23 = 0 , 0.1 , and 0.2 . in these cases",
    "there is only one phase transition , as the mott - insulating lobes ( phase `` mi '' in fig .",
    "[ cbssfig ] ) do not have any non - trivial crystalline order .",
    "our data are consistent with a transition in the 3d xy universality class for @xmath23=0 and a mean - field phase transition for @xmath23 = 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "we studied the @xmath202 phase diagram of two - dimensional interacting bosons by various techniques .",
    "the combination of the various aspects of these treatments allow us to draw the following conclusions .    for on - site interaction",
    "we have seen the lobe structure of the phase boundary in the @xmath157 or @xmath158 plane .",
    "this structure is exactly periodic in the chemical potential @xmath23 in the quantum - phase model of eq .",
    "( [ qp ] ) . in mean field or variational treatments of the different models , the lobes are parabolic near their tips .",
    "the monte carlo results , however , show that the lobes are sharper than predicted by mean - field approximations .",
    "this deviation near the tips of the lobes is expected by scaling arguments : due to the additional particle - hole symmetry at the tips of the lobes , the effective dimension is reduced to @xmath203 and enhanced fluctuations destroy part of the ordered ( superfluid ) phase .",
    "this is consistent with the value of the critical exponent @xmath148 obtained from the simulations ( @xmath170 ) that agrees well with a 3d xy critical point .",
    "similar sharpening of the lobes is seen in a higher - order @xmath86 expansion for the bh model  @xcite .",
    "a central point of this paper is the consideration of finite - range interactions .",
    "they lead to a richer phase diagram , due to commensurability effects .",
    "in particular , charge - density wave or solid order appears in parts of the phase diagram . in our definition",
    "the solid phase is characterized by the breaking of the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice , i.e. , if a density wave with a wave vector smaller than the lattice is present .    upon inclusion of nearest - neighbor interactions new half - filled lobes around half - integer @xmath23",
    "appear in the phase diagram , in which the checkerboard ( @xmath204 ) density wave is stable . for next - nearest neighbor interactions",
    "additional density waves exist in which 1 or 3 out of 4 sites are occupied , around @xmath23=1/4 or 3/4 .",
    "these pure density waves are incompressible mott - insulators .",
    "surprisingly , each mott - insulating charge - density wave seems to have a corresponding compressible supersolid phase in which the particular cdw order coexists with off diagonal lro .    for soft - core bosons the supersolid phases appear already for nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "hard - core bosons , on the other hand , supersolidify only if at least next - nearest neighbor interaction is present .",
    "another difference is the presence of a supersolid at the tip of the half lobe : hard - core bosons only form a supersolid away from half - integer filling , whereas soft - core bosons do so also at half - integer filling .",
    "the difference between bose - hubbard and quantum - phase models is another issue .",
    "our results indicate that , on the mean - field level , the two models are , apart from a trivial rescaling of the hopping matrix element , almost identical for large @xmath182 or @xmath23",
    ". for small @xmath182 corresponding to a filling of less than one boson per site the mean - field solution for the two models differ essentially and are not described by a simple rescaling of the parameters . within our mean - field approximation",
    "we find that the supersolid phase is suppressed around the solid lobe with exactly half filling ( alternating empty and singly - occupied sites ) .",
    "this may be one of the reasons why in a recent numerical simulation of the bh model @xcite a supersolid phase was not found for exactly half filling .",
    "our combined mean - field and monte carlo analysis has shown that the density - wave order transition is not mean - field like .",
    "both the exponents ( @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) and the location of the phase boundary deviate considerably from the mean - field results ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) , see also fig .  [ cbssfig ] .",
    "this may be related to the coupling of the cdw order parameter to the gapless @xmath209 sound mode in the superfluid and remains a subject for further study .",
    "a related issue is the value of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath37 for this transition .",
    "the value @xmath37=1 used in the simulations gives good scaling .",
    "however , other values of @xmath37 turn out to give reasonable scaling as well and yield identical values for @xmath26 , @xmath148 and @xmath143 .",
    "it seems that the cdw transition is rather indifferent to the value of @xmath37 used to scale the systems studied numerically . from the scaling relation @xmath210",
    "we expect the combination @xmath37+@xmath211 0.8@xmath2120.2 which would indicate either a small @xmath197 and renormalized @xmath213 0.8 or @xmath214 and @xmath197 negative .",
    "further simulations and renormalization group studies are required for solving this problem .",
    "in summary we performed an analysis of interacting bosons in 2d within zero temperature lattice models , using and comparing both mean - field theory and exact quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "we obtained the full phase diagram for on - site interaction as well as for nearest - neighbor interactions , in which case our simulations establish the existence of a supersolid phase in which a cdw and superfluidity coexist .    *",
