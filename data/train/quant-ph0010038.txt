    "entanglement is a quantum - mechanical resource that can be used for a number of tasks , including quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , and quantum dense coding .",
    "since real quantum channels are noisy , it is very difficult to create perfect entanglement directly between two distant parties .",
    "there is thus a need to purify ( or distill ) partial entanglement .",
    "suppose two parties share @xmath0 pairs of qubits such that each pair is in the same entangled , but mixed state @xmath2 , the total state @xmath1 of all @xmath0 pairs thus being the @xmath0-fold tensor product @xmath3 .",
    "there exist protocols @xcite , using only local operations and classical communication , which allow the two parties to transform @xmath4 of the pairs into maximally entangled states , for instance singlet states . in the limit @xmath5 , the fidelity of the singlets approaches 1 and the fraction @xmath6 a fixed limit , called the asymptotic yield .    in this paper , we consider the more general case in which the initial state @xmath1 is not a tensor - product state .",
    "this corresponds to the realistic situation that the state @xmath2 of each individual pair is not perfectly known , for instance because one of the particles has been sent through a channel with only partially known characteristics . in secs .",
    "[ sec : hashing ] and [ sec : recurrence ] , we apply the entanglement purification methods known as one - way hashing @xcite and recurrence @xcite to partially known , including completely unknown , quantum states .",
    "it turns out that the generalization of the recurrence method is straightforward , whereas the hashing method as it is described in ref .",
    "@xcite depends on the initial state being of tensor - product form and therefore requires a more careful analysis . unlike briegel _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who have studied entanglement purification with imperfect quantum operations , we assume that all operations are error - free .",
    "a paper related to ours is ref .",
    "@xcite by eisert _",
    "et al . _ , who study how distillable entanglement decreases when information about a quantum state is lost .",
    "before we turn to the actual entanglement purification protocols , we discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : assign ] , the problem of what density operator @xmath1 to assign to @xmath0 pairs of qubits if only partial information is available .",
    "this is an unsolved problem , and we do not attempt to give a general solution .",
    "we show , however , that under the additional assumption of _ exchangeability _ the state @xmath1 must have a certain simple form , which is amenable to entanglement purification .",
    "our discussion also provides a resolution of the apparent paradox found by horodecki _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who give an example where applying the jaynes principle of maximum entropy @xcite leads to a state with more distillable entanglement than seems to be warranted by the available information .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "let us consider the example given by horodecki _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the authors consider a system composed of a single pair of qubits and define an operator @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are projectors onto the bell states , @xmath10 our definition of @xmath11 differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite by a constant factor to simplify the expressions .",
    "if _ all that is known _ about the system state is the expectation value @xmath12 , then jaynes s principle of maximum entropy stipulates that one should assign the state of maximum von neumann entropy compatible with the constraint @xmath13 , which in this case is @xmath14 this state has distillable entanglement .",
    "et al._@xcite point out that the state @xmath15 also satisfies the constraint @xmath13 , but is separable and hence unentangled .",
    "they conclude that the entanglement in the maximum entropy state @xmath16 is `` fake , '' because it violates the condition that an inference scheme `` should not give us an inseparable estimated state if only theoretically there exists a separable state consistent with the measured data . '' as an alternative to the jaynes principle , they propose first to minimize the entanglement and then to find the state of maximum entropy among those states that have minimal entanglement .",
    "for the constraint @xmath13 , this alternative scheme results in the state @xmath17 given above .    a simple defense of the jaynes principle would be the following ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the alternative procedure proposed by horodecki _",
    "_  assumes additional information about the two qubits , namely that entanglement is _ a priori _ unlikely",
    ". this would be reasonable , e.g. , in a situation where the parties know that the state has been prepared by an adversary whose objective is to let them have as little entanglement as possible .",
    "but then more is known about the state than just the given expectation value , and hence the assumptions behind the jaynes procedure are not fulfilled .    if there is no specific additional information , however , the maximum entropy state assignment @xmath16 is preferable to the minimum entanglement assignment @xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "if a projective measurement in the bell basis is performed , assigning @xmath17 corresponds to assigning zero probability to the measurement outcome @xmath18 , an outcome that is not ruled out by the constraint @xmath12 . in this sense ,",
    "the minimum entanglement assignment is inconsistent with the prior information .",
    "by contrast , no inconsistency of this kind can arise from the maximum entropy assignment in the absence of prior information beyond the given expectation value . since no measurement of a single system can tell",
    "if that system is entangled or not , the prediction of `` fake entanglement '' for @xmath16 can cause no difficulty . in particular , there is no way to turn a single @xmath16 state into a maximally entangled state even probabilistically @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case in which the parties share not just one , but @xmath0 qubit pairs .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the total state of the @xmath0 pairs and assume that the @xmath0 pairs are known to satisfy the constraints @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the reduced density operator of the @xmath22-th pair . in this case , the state assignment @xmath23 is not supported by the prior information , even though this is the state of maximum entropy compatible with the given expectation values . for large @xmath0 , this state assignment corresponds to the definite prediction that a nonzero number of perfect singlets can be distilled , which is certainly not implied by the given expectation values .",
    "the alternative state assignment @xmath24 would , however , be equally unsupported by the prior information .",
    "it corresponds to the definite prediction that _ no _ singlets can be distilled from the @xmath0 pairs , which is the minimum number of distillable singlets compatible with the _ a priori _ knowledge .",
    "although this is a very cautious prediction , it is also not implied by the given expectation values .    the fact that a nave application of the principle of maximum entropy to many copies of a system fails is essentially of classical origin and is not unique to problems involving entanglement .",
    "jaynes @xcite has given a thorough discussion of this problem , which can be explained by a simple example .",
    "consider a possibly loaded die .",
    "all that is known about the die is the mean value @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the probability of the outcome @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the probability distribution of maximum entropy compatible with the given mean - value constraint is @xmath29 for @xmath28 . now consider throwing the die @xmath0 times .",
    "a nave application of the maximum entropy principle would predict that the @xmath0 dice throws were independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) according to the single - trial distribution @xmath26 .",
    "this would lead to the prediction that the fraction of throws showing any particular outcome would approximate 1/6 with arbitrary precision as @xmath0 tended to infinity .",
    "this prediction , however , is not implied by the prior knowledge , which is compatible with many possible outcome sequences , including sequences in which only the events @xmath30 and @xmath31 ever occur  quite possible , if the die is loaded . moreover , with an i.i.d .",
    "distribution , the results of earlier throws imply nothing about the probability of later outcomes . even the most gullible gambler might become suspicious if 1 and 6 were the only outcomes after thousands of throws .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , jaynes discusses how to choose the multi - trial distribution in the classical case .",
    "the starting point of his discussion is the assumption that the probability distribution of the @xmath0 dice throws is _ exchangeable_.",
    "the same assumption is the starting point for our quantum analysis .",
    "if exchangeability is assumed , the task of assigning a state of @xmath0 qubit pairs compatible with the constraints given above is much simplified .",
    "a state @xmath1 of @xmath0 copies of a system is exchangeable if it is a member of an exchangeable sequence @xmath32 , @xmath33  .",
    "an exchangeable sequence is defined by    ( i )    @xmath34 for all @xmath22 , where @xmath35 denotes the partial trace over the @xmath36th system , and    ( ii )    each @xmath32 is invariant under permutations of the @xmath22 systems on which it is defined .",
    "this definition is the quantum generalization of de  finetti s @xcite definition of exchangeable sequences of classical random variables .",
    "a state @xmath1 is exchangeable if and only if it can be written in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a measure on density operator space , and @xmath39 is a normalized generating function , @xmath40 .",
    "this is a consequence of the quantum de finetti theorem , the quantum version of the fundamental representation theorem due to de  finetti @xcite .",
    "the quantum theorem was first proved by hudson and moody @xcite after pioneering work by strmer @xcite ; for an elementary proof see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "how , in general , do we pick @xmath41 ? to our knowledge , there is no universal rule for this task , although there exist a number of proposals for unbiased measures @xmath38 on density operator space @xcite .",
    "these can be interpreted as proposals for state assignments for @xmath0 systems under the sole assumption of exchangeability , i.e. , using a generating function @xmath42 .",
    "if , in addition to exchangeability , there is a mean - value constraint @xmath43 , the nave jaynes maximum entropy state assignment leads to a generating function of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath16 is the single - system state of maximum entropy , subject to the constraint ; this generating function is unacceptable for the reasons given above .",
    "a good choice of @xmath41 should be nonzero for all @xmath2 that are compatible with the prior information  we should never arbitrarily rule out any possibility .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 ought to vanish for any @xmath2 which is actually ruled out by the prior information .",
    "we therefore would expect a multi - system generalization of jaynes s maximum entropy procedure to have the form @xmath45 f(\\rho ) d\\rho , \\label{multi_maxent}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a normalization constant and @xmath47 is strictly positive .",
    "the exact form of the function @xmath48 and of the measure @xmath38 is the subject of ongoing research . in the spirit of the single - system jaynes principle",
    ", @xmath41 should favor states @xmath2 with higher von neumann entropy @xmath49 and should give the usual @xmath16 when @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "given an initial state assignment of the form ( [ eq : exch ] ) , additional information can be obtained , e.g. , by making measurements on individual subsystems .",
    "suppose a measurement outcome @xmath22 is represented by a positive single - system operator @xmath51 , with @xmath52 ; i.e. , the @xmath51 form a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) @xcite .",

    "this procedure is a straightforward bayesian version of quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "the condition of exchangeability in combination with the quantum de  finetti theorem provides only a partial solution of the problem of state assignment in the presence of partial information , but we show in the next two sections that exchangeability alone is sufficient to guarantee that the entanglement purification procedures known as one - way hashing and recurrence can be carried out .",
    "the probability of distilling a positive yield of maximally entangled states depends on the exact form of @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exch ] ) .",
    "in this section , we first present a version of the one - way hashing algorithm that proceeds by bayesian updating of the probabilities for products of bell states and that can in principle be applied to general exchangeable states .",
    "we then briefly sketch the argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite that for a product state @xmath60 , where @xmath2 is bell - diagonal with von  neumann entropy @xmath61 , the asymptotic yield of pure singlets is given by @xmath62 .",
    "we show how to modify this argument so that it can be applied to general exchangeable states .",
    "finally we give a simplified bayesian hashing algorithm for exchangeable states and discuss its asymptotic yield .",
    "our analysis is restricted to pairs of qubits , but the method generalizes straightforwardly to arbitrary hilbert space dimensions .",
    "we restrict attention to bell - diagonal states , i.e. , mixtures of the bell states , @xmath63 where we denote the weights by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "most existing entanglement purification procedures begin by making this assumption .",
    "if it does not hold , it is possible to put any state in this form by `` twirling , '' that is , by randomly rotating both spins of an entangled pair . the final yield of maximally entangled states can not be diminished by omitting this step , however , so it is better to think of twirling as a conceptual , rather than a physical procedure . after twirling",
    ", the initial , exchangeable state ( [ eq : exch ] ) of our @xmath0 pairs of qubits becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 we now define the set of labeled states @xmath70 the first bit in the label tells us whether the pair is in a @xmath71 or a @xmath72 state ; the second bit tells us whether it is in a @xmath73 or @xmath74 state .",
    "if we are restricted to local measurements and classical communication on a single pair , the best we can do is to determine one of these two bits , but not both , and the pair will be left in an unentangled state .",
    "et al._have shown , however , that if we can manipulate the qubits collectively , much more interesting measurements are possible @xcite .",
    "the first step is to rewrite the state ( [ rhon ] ) as a probability distribution over strings of bits , with each qubit pair associated with two bits in the string . for this , we define the product distribution @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . using this notation , @xmath80 where @xmath81    we now select a random subset of the bits @xmath82 and list all the qubit pairs which have at least one associated bit in the subset . from this list",
    "we choose one qubit pair to be the _",
    "target_. for each of the other qubit pairs in the list , alice and bob both perform one of a set of three unitary transformations on their half of the pair , followed by a bilateral controlled - not onto the target pair .",
    "this sequence of operations is equivalent to replacing one of the bits of the target pair with the parity of a subset of all the bits .",
    "the choice of unitary transformation corresponds to including the first , second , or both of the bits from a particular pair in the parity calculation .",
    "then a measurement is performed on the target pair .",
    "( the details of this procedure are given in @xcite . ) by carrying out such a procedure , one bit of joint information is acquired about all the pairs , at the expense of sacrificing one entangled pair ( that is , two bits ) .",
    "the unmeasured pairs in general undergo an invertible transformation among the bell states , but they do not become entangled with each other , and this transformation can , if one chooses , be undone , leaving the sequence of bits for the unmeasured pairs unaltered .",
    "et al._have shown that such a procedure can be equivalent to finding the parity of any subset of the @xmath83 bits .",
    "this parity bit then allows one to update the probability distribution for the remaining @xmath84-bit string .",
    "let us examine this in a little more detail .",
    "let @xmath85 denote a sequence of bits .",
    "we can select a subset of these bits by giving another sequence @xmath86 , which includes a 1 for each bit to be included in the subset and a 0 for the rest .",

    "the purification scheme follows simply from this .",
    "one chooses subsets of the bit string at random and measures their parity , sacrificing one pair with each measurement , but updating the probability distribution for the remaining strings .",
    "this procedure is repeated until one is left with only a single string , say @xmath95 , with probability @xmath96 for some small @xmath97 . written more formally , the posterior probability @xmath98 at the end of the procedure , conditioned on all measurement results , has the property @xmath99 for some sequence @xmath95 .",
    "one then knows with high probability the maximally entangled state of each remaining pair , which can then be transformed into a standard state ( such as @xmath18 ) by local operations .",
    "the yield of this procedure is the number of entangled pairs left at the end .",
    "it is clear that there are states for which the yield is zero .",
    "the obvious example is a state @xmath60 where @xmath2 is unentangled . for states of the form @xmath100 ,",
    "bennett _ et al .",
    "_  have shown that asymptotically the method gives a yield of @xmath101 maximally entangled pairs with fidelity approaching 1 , where @xmath102 is the entropy of @xmath103 .",
    "the argument makes use of the theorem of typical sequences @xcite ( which is closely related to shannon s noiseless coding theorem @xcite ) , according to which , for any @xmath104 and @xmath105 and sufficiently large @xmath0 , there exists a subset @xmath106 of the set of all sequences @xmath88 with the following properties : @xmath107 i.e. , the total probability of the set @xmath106 is arbitrarily close to 1 ; and @xmath108 i.e. , the number of sequences in @xmath106 is not much larger than @xmath109 . the set @xmath106 is called the set of typical sequences . since the parity measurement in each hashing round rules out half the typical sequences on average and since essentially all the probability",
    "is concentrated on the typical sequences , it can be expected that after sacrificing approximately @xmath110 pairs , essentially all the probability is concentrated on a single typical sequence .",
    "clearly this leads to a positive yield only if @xmath111 .",
    "the theorem of typical sequences does not hold in general for sequences corresponding to exchangeable states of the form ( [ rhon ] ) . to apply the hashing method in this case ,",

    "if the generating function @xmath162 has no significant support on weights @xmath115 with @xmath174 , then hashing can not be used for entanglement purification , at least initially . it might still be possible , however , to distill some entanglement by using the more robust ( but far more wasteful ) technique of _ recurrence _",
    "@xcite .    in the recurrence algorithm ,",
    "an initial set of @xmath83 entangled qubit pairs is grouped into @xmath0 sets of 2 pairs each . in each set , one pair is designated the _ target _ pair , and the other the _ control _ pair .",
    "alice and bob thus have @xmath0 target qubits and @xmath0 control qubits each .",
    "alice now rotates all her qubits by @xmath175 about the @xmath176 axis , while bob rotates all his qubits by @xmath177 about the @xmath176 axis .",
    "each of them then performs a controlled - not operation from each control qubit onto the corresponding target qubit and measures his or her target qubit in the @xmath178 basis ( @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) .",
    "the target qubits are then discarded .",
    "if alice and bob both get the same result for a given target pair ( i.e. , both 0 or both 1 ) , the procedure has succeeded , and the control pair can be shown to have increased entanglement . if their results differ , the procedure has failed , and the control qubits must also be discarded .    if the state of both target and control pairs is of form ( [ bell_mixtures ] ) , the probability of success is @xmath181 and the new state of the control pair after the measurement has weights @xcite @xmath182 if initially @xmath183 , then this procedure converges towards @xmath184 .",
    "the convergence is slow , however , and since more than half of all the pairs is discarded each time , the yield is generally low .",
    "suppose that instead of a product state we have an exchangeable state of the form ( [ rhon ] ) .",
    "we can carry out the procedure exactly as before , grouping the pairs into sets of two , with a target and control bit .",
    "if there are initially @xmath83 pairs in the state @xmath185 then after performing the measurements , alice and bob will get the same result @xmath186 times and different results @xmath187 times , leaving them with a new state of the form ( [ rho2n ] ) for @xmath186 pairs . for large @xmath0 , the posterior distribution @xmath188 will generally be sharply peaked about those @xmath115 which give a value of @xmath189 close to @xmath190 . unlike hashing",
    ", the recurrence algorithm produces a posterior state @xmath191 which is exchangeable .",
    "we now turn to how we find this state in light of the measurement results .",
    "compared with the hashing algorithm , where precisely one bit of information is obtained in each round of the procedure , in the recurrence method much more information is obtained , namely the value of @xmath186 .",
    "we can therefore deduce the posterior distribution @xmath192 where @xmath193^\\nsucc    [ 1-\\psucc(\\w)]^{n-\\nsucc}\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath194 because the remaining states have been transformed according to ( [ neww ] ) , we must also change to the new variables @xmath195 .",
    "so the new state is @xmath196 where @xmath197    while this bayesian procedure is very simple compared to the hashing method , it is still a bit too complicated for simple illustration .",
    "there is , however , an even simpler variant of this technique that is easy to analyze .",
    "suppose that , instead of the general bell - diagonal state ( [ bell_mixtures ] ) , we have an initial werner state @xmath198 we can carry out the recurrence procedure exactly as above , with the probability of success @xmath199 here @xmath200 denotes the fidelity of the state with @xmath201 , with @xmath202 necessary for distillability .",
    "the recurrence procedure does not in general lead to a new state of form ( [ werner ] ) , but by twirling the state can be put in this form , at the cost of some increase in entropy .",
    "the new state has a fidelity @xmath203    suppose that we have @xmath83 entangled pairs , with partial information sufficient to determine that they are all in a state of the form  ( [ werner ] ) , but not to determine the exact fidelity @xmath200 .",
    "the joint state of the pairs is then @xmath204 we then group the pairs into sets of two and carry out the recurrence procedure on each set , with @xmath186 successful results .",
    "we can then deduce a revised generating function @xmath205 where @xmath206^\\nsucc    [ 1-\\psucc(f)]^{n-\\nsucc}\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath207 the new density operator for the @xmath186 remaining pairs is @xmath208 where the the posterior distribution is expressed in terms of the new variable @xmath209 given by ( [ new_fidelity ] ) . working this out explicitly ,",
    "we get @xmath210 } \\over 10 - 8f ' } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath211 is the inverse of ( [ new_fidelity ] ) : @xmath212    we can see how much information is gained by a single round of the recurrence method using this simplified version as an example . if the initial generating function is a uniform distribution , @xmath213 for @xmath214 , then for large @xmath0 the posterior distribution is highly peaked after one round .",
    "we see this in figure 1 , where the prior and posterior distributions are shown for different values of @xmath0 and a typical choice of @xmath186 .",
    "note that states with @xmath215 move towards @xmath216 under the procedure , producing a peak about the completely mixed state ; for high @xmath0 and the value of @xmath186 used in our example , this peak is suppressed by the bayesian updating .",
    "states with @xmath202 move towards @xmath217 .",
    "the procedure has fixed points at @xmath216 , @xmath218 , and @xmath217 .",
    "it should be noted that because of its extremely small yield , the recurrence method should never be used if hashing is possible . an initial state that can not be distilled by the hashing method , however ,",
    "might , after one or more rounds of the recurrence method , satisfy the criterion ( [ eq : defeta ] ) for some value of @xmath121 .",
    "if that is so , then a combination of tomography and hashing should be used thereafter , as described in the last section .",
    "similarly , if @xmath39 has some support on distillable and some on undistillable states , a few rounds of the recurrence method generally produces convergence on either a distillable or undistillable state , without ambiguity . under certain circumstances ,",
    "however , it might be beneficial to supplement this with tomographic measurements on a number of pairs as well .",
    "for example , the updating procedure ( [ neww ] ) treats the coefficients @xmath219 and @xmath220 symmetrically .",
    "an initially symmetric state thus has this symmetry preserved , and the distribution @xmath162 might become double - peaked . in this case , measuring a small number of pairs would suffice to eliminate one of the two peaks .",
    "we have given a bayesian account of the entanglement purification procedures of one - way hashing and recurrence .",
    "the bayesian formulation allows us to provide a straightforward discussion of the conditions under which maximally entangled states can be distilled from unknown or partially known quantum states . for one - way hashing",
    ", we have given the _ a priori _ probabilities for the possible asymptotic yields of maximally entangled pairs .",
    "our results can be used to decide which combination of quantum state tomography , recurrence , and hashing to use to obtain the highest expected yield , both asymptotically and in the case of a fixed number of initially given pairs .",
    "although our discussion is entirely in terms of pairs of qubits , the method is general and can be applied to any generalization of hashing or recurrence in hilbert spaces of higher dimension .",
