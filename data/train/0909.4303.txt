    "the first observations ( go2 , pid 20070 ) were carried out in january 2006 with the mips medium scan mode and two scan passes per sky pixel . as described in more detail by @xcite this shallow imaging covered a total area of @xmath04deg@xmath18 centered on cosmos , with a median integration time of 80s per pixel .",

    "all the data set was reduced following the procedure outlined in @xcite . for each observing campaign a background pattern derived for every scan mirror position of the instrument was scaled and subtracted from all individual frames .",

    "they were finally coadded with our own idl routines using the median of all the pixels associated with each sky position .",
    "we stress that the use of a median combination was necessary in order to reject moving sources present in the field at the time of the observations . a forthcoming paper ( aussel et al . in prep .",
    ") will describe in more detail the data reduction .",
    "it will also provide a list of the 24@xmath1m  detected asteroids in cosmos .",
    "the 24@xmath1 m sources in our mosaic were detected using the automatic procedure of the sextractor software @xcite and we measured their flux densities with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting technique of the daophot package @xcite .",
    "given the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the mips-24@xmath1 m psf ( @xmath06 ) , most of the sources are not resolved in our data . in deep and crowded images such as the ones typically obtained in the mips deep surveys , the psf fitting thus provides more reliable flux measurements than aperture photometry .",
    "furthermore , daophot performs simultaneous fits to multiple objects , which ensures a proper separation of blended sources especially when the fluxes are close to the confusion limit .",
    "no prior information from any other wavelength was used for the source detection itself .",
    "however , several psf fitting iterations were necessary to achieve a clean extraction of the blended sources that were not properly identified by sextractor in the input 24@xmath1 m image . in brief ,",
    "these blended cases were located ( with sextractor again ) as positive detections in the residual mosaic obtained after the first psf fitting .",
    "their positions were added to the initial list of 24@xmath1 m sources determined with sextractor and another extraction of the initial cosmos 24@xmath1 m image was then performed .",
    "three iterations of this process were carried out , until the residual mosaic was cleaned from any positive signal above the detection threshold chosen for sextractor .",
    "the result of this psf fitting is illustrated in figure  [ fig : daophot ] .",
    "it shows a sub - region of our cosmos 24@xmath1 m mosaic along with the corresponding residual image obtained after subtracting all sources extracted with daophot .    to run this psf fitting we built an empirical psf from the brightest point sources identified in the mosaic and we subsequently fit this psf to every single object detected by sextractor .",
    "daophot performs this fit by scaling the empirical psf within a fixed circular aperture centered on the source and it provides the flux of the fitted psf _ enclosed within this aperture_. therefore a correction must be applied to account for the spatially - extended wings of the psf lying beyond the radius of the chosen aperture .",
    "this correction was determined using the mips-24@xmath1 m stiny tim psf models provided by the _",
    "spitzer science center_. these models allow to account for the fraction of energy lying at large radii where the signal to noise in our data is not large enough to constrain the exact profile of the point spread function .",
    "relying on such corrections we believe that our flux absolute calibration should be accurate within a few percent , which is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite as part of the calibration of the mips 24@xmath1 m detector .    following the convention adopted by the",
    "_ spitzer science center _ we assumed a stellar 10000k black - body spectrum as the reference underlying sed for the 24@xmath1 m flux density measurements .",
    "we tested this calibration by cross - correlating our source list with the stars of the _ two micron all sky survey _ ( 2mass ) catalog @xcite .",
    "our comparison did not reveal any systematic deviation from the relation @xmath27 = 0 $ ] ( vega , with [ 24 ] denoting the equivalent magnitude measured in the 24@xmath1 m mips bandpass ) , which is expected for most of the stellar spectral types when no dust emission excess is detected above the photospheric stellar emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this cross - correlation also allowed us to register the absolute astrometric calibration of our 24@xmath1 m mosaic to the 2mass astrometric system .",
    "this was performed by applying a systematic offset of @xmath28dec=@xmath290.3 to the astrometry derived from the _ spitzer _ data products .",
    "the noise in the final 24@xmath1 m mosaic was characterized using two different methods .",
    "first , we computed the dispersion of a set of random flux measurements performed over blank field regions of the cosmos 24@xmath1 m image within the same aperture as the one used for the psf fitting .",
    "similar to the photometry measurements described above a flux correction was applied to account for the extent of the psf lying outside of the aperture , which led to an equivalent sensitivity limit of 1@xmath30=18@xmath1jy .",
    "second , we also performed a number of simulations adding artificial point - like sources in blank field regions of the mosaic .",
    "we measured the fluxes of these sources with the psf fitting of daophot and the distribution of the differences between their measured and input fluxes was fitted with a gaussian function .",
    "our best fit was obtained for a 1@xmath30  standard deviation varying between 14@xmath1jy and 16@xmath1jy depending on the range of input fluxes . using these simulations we finally examined the robustness of the error measurements provided by our psf fitting by comparing the daophot uncertainties obtained for the simulated point sources with the errors directly estimated from the differences between their measured and input fluxes .",
    "we applied a systematic scaling of 3.8 to all the daophot errors so as to get 68% of the distribution of these differences within the daophot 1@xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "the completeness of our 24@xmath1 m source extraction was determined using the same point source simulations as the ones described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we inserted within the mosaic a set of empirical psfs that were scaled to provide a flux distribution representative of the one characterizing the 24@xmath1 m extragalactic source population .",
    "these psfs were subsequently extracted following the same method as the one employed to detect and to measure the flux of the sources already present in the 24@xmath1 m image .",
    "we found that our source extraction is more than 90% complete above a 24@xmath1 m flux @xmath2@xmath080@xmath1jy , which should thus be considered as a safe and conservative flux limit for any analysis requiring an unbiased 24@xmath1 m selection of sources in the cosmos field . according to the simulations though ,",
    "our psf fitting is still reliable down to fluxes as faint as @xmath060@xmath1jy and in spite of a lower completeness ( @xmath075% ) our source extraction should suffer from a relatively small contamination by fake objects at these flux levels .",
    "based on this characterization we defined our final cosmos mips-24@xmath1 m catalog as the population of 24@xmath1 m sources brighter than 60@xmath1jy lying within the area covered by the cosmos photometric redshift catalog of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , see section  [ sec : photoz ] ) but outside of the masked regions defined from the subaru optical observations of the cosmos field .",
    "these masked areas cover a surface as large as 0.26deg@xmath18 but the optical photometry in these regions is affected by larger uncertainties due to the presence of very bright or even saturated objects .",
    "in particular , the photometric redshifts in these areas are less accurate .",
    "keeping these regions would thus compromise our analysis of the mips - selected galaxies given the large fraction of 24@xmath1 m sources associated with faint optical counterparts .",
    "our 24@xmath1 m catalog represents a total of 39413 sources covering an effective area of 1.68deg@xmath18 . in the remaining of this section  2",
    "we will describe the identification of the 24@xmath1 m source counterparts down to @xmath2@xmath3160@xmath1jy .",
    "this characterization will supplement other studies carried out by our team using selections performed at other wavelengths .",
    "however , the analysis reported in some other sections of this current paper assume an unbiased 24@xmath1 m selection and only sources above 80@xmath1jy will be considered in this case .      to ensure the most reliable and most complete identification of the 24@xmath1 m source counterparts , we first correlated the 24@xmath1 m data with the @xmath32band cosmos catalog of mccracken et al .",
    "( submitted to apj ) .",
    "as we will see later a non - negligible fraction of the 24@xmath1 m sources at @xmath5@xmath31 are associated with extremely faint optical counterparts .",
    "a direct cross - correlation between the mips-24@xmath1 m and the optical catalogs of cosmos would thus result in a lower rate of identifications .",
    "furthermore , the larger uncertainties affecting the determination of source centroids at faint 24@xmath1 m fluxes , the width of the 24@xmath1 m psf and the very high density of optical sources in our data ( e.g. , @xmath045 galaxies  arcmin@xmath33 for @xmath34@xmath3525mag in the subaru cosmos observations , @xcite ) could lead to lots of wrong associations if these identifications had to rely on a direct match between the 24@xmath1 m and optical source catalogs . on the contrary , the cosmos @xmath32band catalog is deep enough ( @xmath36@xmath023.7mag at 5@xmath30 , mccracken et al . ) to detect counterparts for the majority of the 24@xmath1 m selected sources down to our mips sensitivity limit .",
    "the density of @xmath32band sources is also substantially smaller ( @xmath07 galaxies  arcmin@xmath33 for @xmath36@xmath3522mag ) than in the optical bands and the near - ir wavelengths are  closer \" to the 24@xmath1 m bandpass , which minimizes the risk of wrong associations between mid - ir and @xmath32-selected sources . finally we note that these @xmath32band observations of cosmos were executed under excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath00.7 at 2.2@xmath1 m ) .",
    "compared to the other cosmos near - ir data taken with e.g. , the irac instrument ( fwhm@xmath01.6 at 3.6@xmath1 m , @xcite ) , the psf in the @xmath32band image is much narrower and allows more robust identifications in the case of sources blended at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "we correlated the 24@xmath1 m and @xmath32band catalogs with a matching radius of 2 .",
    "we found that this distance was large enough to enable the identification of most of the 24@xmath1 m sources , taking into account the width of the 24@xmath1 m psf ( fwhm@xmath06 ) and the uncertainty on the astrometric position of each single 24@xmath1 m source .",
    "this radius was nonetheless sufficiently small to minimize the fraction of multiple matches as well as the association between objects randomly - aligned on the sky . among the 39413 mips24@xmath1 m sources of the catalog",
    ", we identified a single @xmath32band counterpart for 33146 objects ( 84% of the sample ) while two possible matches were obtained for 4470 other 24@xmath1 m detections ( @xmath011.5% ) . for theses cases we kept",
    "the closest possible counterpart when its centroid was at least twice closer to the 24@xmath1 m source than the second possible match ( 2320 objects ) while additional priors from the cosmos irac-3.6@xmath1 m observations were considered to assign the most likely counterpart to the other 24@xmath1 m detections .",
    "no association was found for the remaining 1797 sources ( 4.5% of the catalog ) .",
    "a cross - correlation between these unidentified sources and our 3.6@xmath1 m catalog using the same matching radius revealed irac counterparts for 437 objects , a rare population that must be characterized by extremely steep seds between 2@xmath1 m and 24@xmath1 m .",
    "for the other sources a visual inspection of our data showed that some of them may have counterparts either fainter than the detection thresholds of our @xmath32/irac cosmos catalogs or with a centroid located slightly beyond our 2 matching radius .",
    "many of the unidentified objects have also a signal / noise below 5@xmath30 at 24@xmath1 m . at the faintest 24@xmath1 m flux",
    "leves some could originate from a small contamination of our catalog by fake sources .",
    "it should however not significantly bias our subsequent results given the small fraction that they represent among the whole sample of 24@xmath1 m sources . in summary",
    "we identified secure @xmath32band counterparts for @xmath090% of the cosmos 24@xmath1 m catalog down to 60@xmath1jy , while less robust identifications were still found for another 5.5% of the mips-24@xmath1 m source population .",
    "finally we note that this cross - identification with near - ir data also revealed 53 pairs of 24@xmath1 m sources associated with the same @xmath32band counterpart .",
    "a careful inspection of the 24@xmath1 m mosaic revealed that they correspond to single objects incorrectly deblended by the psf fitting performed in the mips data .",
    "these `` double '' components were merged together to form a unique 24@xmath1 m source , reducing the mips - selected catalog to 39360 objects .",
    "the distance of the 24@xmath1 m sources was characterized using the photometric redshifts derived by @xcite and @xcite for the optically and x - ray selected sources of the cosmos field .",
    "these photometric redshifts were determined with deep photometry ( e.g. , capak et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) performed in a total of 30  large , medium and narrow band filters over a wavelength range covering the far - uv at 1550 up to the mid - ir at 8.0@xmath1 m .",
    "this large amount of data and the high quality of the observations used in their work resulted in a substantial improvement of photometric redshift accuracy with respect to the determination of redshifts performed in other fields .",
    "the catalog of ( * ? ? ? * , hereafter i09 ) provides redshifts for 933789 sources selected at @xmath34@xmath3526.5mag from the subaru / suprime  cam observations of cosmos , with a dispersion as small as @xmath37 for @xmath34@xmath3524mag and @xmath5@xmath351.25 . this unprecedented accuracy in photometric redshift determinations",
    "was mostly achieved thanks to the high sampling of the observed spectral energy distribution of sources around the position of their balmer break as well as a new method accounting for the contribution of emission lines to their measured flux densities . as shown by @xcite the uncertainties affecting their redshift estimates depend primarily on the redshift and the apparent @xmath6band magnitude of sources ( see their figure  9 ) , with errors naturally increasing for fainter and more distant galaxies .",
    "however a comparison with faint spectroscopic samples obtained in the cosmos field ( @xcite ) revealed a dispersion @xmath38 as low as 0.06 for sources with 23mag@xmath35@xmath34@xmath3525mag at 1.5@xmath7@xmath5@xmath73 .",
    "these small uncertainties will be critical for our analysis of the mips - selected galaxy population given the large fraction of 24@xmath1 m sources associated with faint ( i.e. , @xmath34@xmath324mag ) optical counterparts at @xmath5@xmath31 .",
    "the redshifts provided by i09 were determined using a library of star - forming and passive galaxy templates and they are not adapted to galaxies dominated in their optical / near - ir continuum by the contribution of an active galactic nucleus ( such as the type  1 agns and optically - luminous quasars ) .",

    "the photometric redshifts of the full @xmath39-selected sample mostly lie at 0.5@xmath7@xmath5@xmath71.5 but extend up to @xmath5@xmath03 , with an accuracy as good as @xmath40 for faint sources ( @xmath34@xmath322.5mag ) at @xmath5@xmath01 @xcite .",
    "we stress that the redshifts of i09 were also used in the case of the 24@xmath1 m sources associated with obscured nuclei ( such as sources characterized by a rising power - law continuum in the irac bands ) but with no x - ray detection .",
    "their emission at optical wavelengths is usually dominated by the contribution of their host galaxy and the photometric redshifts of i09 should not be significantly less accurate than those determined for star - forming sources .",
    "this argument is actually reinforced by the rather good agreement that we observed betweeen the redshifts of @xcite and those of @xcite for the type  2 agns common to both samples .      to derive the photometric redshifts of the 24@xmath1 m sources we first correlated the list of their @xmath32band counterparts with the catalog of @xcite using a matching radius of 1 .",

    "all these deviations from our results could originate either from less accurate photometric redshifts that were used in some of these other studies , or from the effect of cosmic variance over small fields of view like the cdfs .",
    "the large number of 24@xmath1 m sources at 0.5@xmath7@xmath5@xmath71.5 and our analysis of the history of the 24@xmath1 m background light also shows that the cib must originate predominantly from moderately - luminous galaxies at intermediate redshifts rather than highly obscured and luminous dusty sources at @xmath5@xmath32 .",

    "interestingly we found that the number of 24@xmath1 m sources with bright near - ir counterparts ( i.e. , @xmath32@xmath720.5mag vega ) in the simulations is clearly underestimated at all redshifts beyond @xmath5@xmath00.5 .",

    "in addition to the overall underestimate of the predicted source density at this redshift , we thus conclude that a large fraction of simulated galaxies at @xmath5@xmath01 are too blue with respect to the typical 24@xmath1 m detected sources .",
    "this trend actually recalls the discrepancy that we also observed at @xmath5@xmath02 where the overestimate of predicted sources originates from blue galaxies with @xmath32band luminosities much fainter than the bulk of 24@xmath1 m sources found at this redshift .",
    "the origin of this excess of blue galaxies with a 24@xmath1 m detection above our sensitivity limit is not straight forward to determine .",
    "assuming that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of individual sources is correctly predicted by the simulations , it may be related to an incorrect description of their spectral energy distributions . as we mentioned in sect.[sec : z_distrib ] the broad aromatic features commonly observed at 7.7@xmath1 m , 11.3@xmath1 m and 12.7@xmath1 m in the spectra of starburst galaxies can enhance their detectability when these lines are redshifted into the mips-24@xmath1 m bandpass .",
    "an overestimate of the strength of the 7.7@xmath1 m feature could thus result in too many 24@xmath1 m sources predicted at @xmath5@xmath02 .",
    "furthermore the @xmath78band emission of galaxies at such high redshifts relates to their rest - frame uv properties , which are obviously very sensitive to dust extinction given our selection performed at mid - ir wavelengths",
    ". a wrong treatment of the obscuration affecting these 24@xmath1 m sources would thus bias their predicted characteristics at optical wavelengths as well as the estimate of their reprocessed dust emission in the mid - infrared .    on the other hand , this excess could also originate from an overestimate of the galaxy star formation rate itself . in the simulations of @xcite galaxies with on - going bursts of star formation account for @xmath050% and @xmath390% the 24@xmath1 m source population at @xmath5@xmath01 and @xmath5@xmath02 respectively ( the other sources being classified as quiescent galaxies , see their figure  a4 ) .",
    "their mid - ir emission directly scales with their star - forming activity , which could lead to a too large number of predicted sources if their sfr is statistically too high .",
    "indeed , star formation processes critically depend on fundamental mechanisms and physical parameters that may still not be fully constrained in the simulations , like for instance the critical density above which stars can form depending on the galaxy internal dynamics and the various energy feedback ( agns , supernovae , ... ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the observed optical and near - ir colors may also depend on the initial mass function ( imf ) assumed in the simulations . in the model of @xcite a normal neighborhood",
    "imf leads to a too little evolution of the mid - ir luminosity function compared to the data , and it also underestimates the strong evolution observed in the faint submillimeter number counts @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient characterizing their scenario is the use of a top - heavy imf for the bursts of star formation triggered by galaxy mergers , which seems to better reproduce the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function observed in the mid - ir . under this assumption",
    "though , the larger fraction of blue and massive stars produced in bursts should lead to bluer stellar populations and this could be one of the reasons explaining the excess of blue galaxies in their predictions . a much more detailed comparison between the intrinsic properties ( mass , sfr , seds ) of _ individual _ simulated sources and those characterizing the observed 24@xmath1 m galaxy population will be necessary to identify the critical parameters that need to be better constrained for improving model predictions in the infrared .",
    "given the large number of ingredients to control , the determination of proper predictions of galaxy evolution at ir wavelengths with current semi - analytical models remains obviously a challenging task .",
    "reproducing the evolution of the ir luminosity function requires not only an accurate description of the evolution of the bolometric luminosity function for star - forming galaxies but also an accurate treatment of dust extinction as a function of galaxy properties and a reliable representation of galaxy seds in the infrared . furthermore ,",
    "dust - obscured star - forming galaxies are not the only contributers to the number counts at ir wavelengths .",
    "quasars and dusty agns should also be taken into account , especially at the bright end of the luminosity function where their contribution is far from being negligible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the coeval growth of bulges and super - massive black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  composite \" sources experiencing both nuclear and star - forming activity may actually represent a large fraction of the mid - ir selected galaxy population at high redshift .",
    "this large variety of physical properties characterizing ir - luminous galaxies added to the complexity of their spectral signatures in the mid - ir can thus make the predictions from semi - analytical simulations particularly difficult at ir wavelengths .",
    "this contribution of nuclear accretion to cosmic history has not been implemented in the model of @xcite .",
    "therefore the feedback action of agns , which has been recently discussed in the framework of other semi - analytical models as an efficient process to regulate the star - forming activity in galaxies , is not taken into account in their simulations . instead , the decrease of gas cooling for the formation of massive spheroids is controlled in their model by the action of superwinds driven by supernova explosions .",
    "these winds produce a feedback effect qualitatively similar to that of agns , but the underlying physical mechanisms are somehow different and they result in different predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function with redshift @xcite .",
    "infrared simulations of distant sources accounting for the role of agn feedback were actually presented by @xcite using the model of @xcite .",
    "however their scenario did not directly include the merging of galaxies and dark matter haloes , and contrary to our results their 24@xmath1 m source redshift distribution at @xmath2@xmath90.2mjy was predicted to peak at @xmath5@xmath02 .",
    "given the current @xmath19cdm paradigm as well as the role that nuclear accretion played in the evolution of dusty high redshift galaxies , one possible approach to progress in our understanding of the deep ir universe with semi - analytical models would be therefore to explore the impact of scenarios including both the hierarchical assembly of dark matter haloes and the contribution of agns .",

    "<S> we present the first results obtained from the identification of @xmath030000  sources in the _ spitzer_/24@xmath1 m observations of the cosmos field at @xmath2@xmath380@xmath1jy . using accurate photometric redshifts </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath4@xmath00.12 at @xmath5@xmath02 for 24@xmath1 m sources with @xmath6@xmath725mag  ab ) and simple extrapolations of the number counts at faint fluxes we resolve with unprecedented detail the build - up of the mid - infrared background across cosmic ages . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath050% and @xmath080% of the 24@xmath1 m background intensity originate from galaxies at @xmath5@xmath71 and @xmath5@xmath72 respectively , supporting the scenario where highly obscured sources at very high redshifts ( @xmath5@xmath32 ) contribute only marginally to the cosmic infrared background . </S>",
    "<S> assuming flux - limited selections at optical wavelengths , we also find that the fraction of @xmath6band sources with 24@xmath1 m detection strongly increases up to @xmath5@xmath02 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star - forming galaxies have undergone with lookback time . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless this rising trend shows a clear break at @xmath5@xmath01.3 , probably due to @xmath8-correction effects implied by the complexity of spectral energy distributions in the mid - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our results with the predictions from different models of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> we note that semi - analytical formalisms currently fail to reproduce the redshift distributions observed at 24@xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the simulated galaxies at @xmath2@xmath980@xmath1jy exhibit @xmath10 colors much bluer than observed and the predicted @xmath11band fluxes are systematically underestimated at @xmath5@xmath30.5 . </S>",
    "<S> unless these discrepancies mainly result from an incorrect treatment of extinction in the models they may reflect an underestimate of the predicted density of high redshift massive sources with strong on - going star formation , which would point to more fundamental processes and/or parameters ( e.g. , initial mass function , critical density to form stars , feedback , ... ) that are still not fully controlled in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonably well the flux / redshift distribution of 24@xmath1 m sources up to @xmath5@xmath03 , although none of them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts . </S>"
