    "the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation is a collective effect which relies on the bosonic nature of the particles alone ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "although an interaction between particles is not needed for the corresponding phase transition , its presence has a substantial influence on the properties of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in this context , solitons are of fundamental interest since they represent states whose very existence relies on the interaction .    for atomic becs , bright solitons as well as dark solitons have been experimentally demonstrated for atoms with attractive @xcite and repulsive interaction @xcite , respectively .",
    "the present work is motivated by the recent observation of gap solitons in a @xmath0rb bec @xcite .",
    "gap solitons are bright solitons for a bec with repulsive interaction in an optical lattice and rely on the negative effective mass around the upper band edge of the periodic potential . to create a gap soliton it is necessary to control the motion of the initial wavepacket in quasi - momentum space @xcite .",
    "this kind of physical situation has recently been intensively studied , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    in the present work we consider the influence of the transverse confining potential on the dynamics of a bec in an one - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "we are particularly interested in the behaviour around the upper band edge of the lowest energy band . in this energy range",
    "the transverse confinement leads to the presence of transversally excited resonant states which significantly change the stability of the bec @xcite and alter its dynamics @xcite .",
    "the resonances are important if the transverse excitation energy is small compared to the modulation depth of the optical lattice .",
    "much of the recent research on bec is concerned with an effectively one - dimensional situation .",
    "generally this can be achieved if the transverse excitation energy is large compared to the interaction energy .",
    "this allows a simplified one - dimensional description of the dynamics by either projecting the collective wavefunction on the transverse ground state @xcite or , more accurately , by making a gaussian variational ansatz for the transverse shape of the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "while such an approach gives excellent agreement with a full three - dimensional theory in absence of transverse resonances ( i.e. , around the lower band edge in the case of a 1d optical lattice @xcite ) , it is not suitable to describe a bec around the upper band edge @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a generalized one - dimensional theory by projecting the collective wavefunction on a superposition of longitudinal wavepackets centered around the resonant states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] we will review the preparation of a bec at the upper band edge in order to motivate our particular approach . in sec .  [ sec : dyneqs ] simplified dynamical equations are derived and compared to previous approaches . in sec .",
    "[ sec : variat ] we further reduce these equations by making a variational ansatz for the wavefunction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sol ] we will discuss several solutions of this system .",
    "very recently , gap solitons have been experimentally observed in a bec of rubidium atoms @xcite .",
    "gap solitons correspond to a wavepacket of repulsively interacting atoms prepared at the upper band edge of the lowest band in an optical lattice .",
    "the process of creating a gap soliton is quite sophisticated since one has to move the bec from the ground state , where it first is created , to the upper band edge of the optical lattice . for the purpose of this paper",
    "it can be summarized in the following way : first , a bec is created in the ground state of a 3d harmonic trap @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the atomic mass and @xmath3 are the axial and transverse trapping frequencies .",
    "then a one - dimensional optical lattice of the form @xmath4 along the @xmath5 axis is switched on adiabatically and the axial harmonic trap is switched off ( @xmath6 ) . here , @xmath7 is the wavevector of the laser beam forming the optical lattice . at this time the lattice phase @xmath8 is zero .",
    "the bec is thus prepared as a wavepacket around the lower band edge of the lowest band of the optical lattice .",
    "finally , a bloch oscillation is employed ( @xmath8 varying with time ) so that the wavepacket is slowly moving upwards in the energy band ( so that excitations to higher bands can be neglected ) and eventually reaches the upper band edge .",
    "this is an application of dispersion management for atomic matter waves which is described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and is now of high experimental interest @xcite .    to describe the dynamics of a bec that is manipulated within the lowest energy band of the lattice",
    ", it would be desirable to have an effective dynamical equation at hand which is one - dimensional and based on the effective - mass approximation , rather than including the full periodic and transverse trapping potentials .",
    "to derive such an equation we start from the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for a bec in a 1d optical lattice and a transverse trapping potential , @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the collective atomic wavefunction which we assume to be normalized to one .",
    "the interaction parameter is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the atomic scattering length and @xmath15 the number of atoms in the bec .",
    "we have also included a homogeneous force term which corresponds to an acceleration @xmath16 of the atoms .",
    "this term is closely related to the time variation of the lattice phase @xmath17 and responsible for the generation of bloch oscillations of the wavepacket . to avoid exciting atoms to higher bands of the optical lattice ,",
    "the acceleration must be small enough so that adiabatic motion in the lowest band is possible . throughout the paper",
    "we will assume that this is the case .",
    "we have omitted a longitudinal confining potential since our aim is to study the effects of the transverse dynamics rather than the perturbation of the longitudinal lattice symmetry .",
    "a weak longitudinal potential could be included by introducing a slow variation of the lattice parameters @xcite , however .",
    "being nonlinear and inhomogeneous , eq .  ( [ eq : gpe ] ) is impossible to solve analytically .",
    "even the numerical simulation of it is time - consuming because of the necessity to resolve features on the scale of half the laser s wavelength ( which is equal to the period of the lattice ) .",
    "in addition , it would be desirable to have a description which uses the ( numerically verified ) fact that the wavepacket stays localized in the energy band for a long time if the modulation depth @xmath18 is sufficiently small .",
    "we remark that , if @xmath18 gets too large , a phase transition to a spatially localized state which is smeared out over the lowest energy band takes place instead @xcite .",
    "to derive such an analytical theory , we employ the observation that a wavepacket , which is narrowly localized around a certain quasi - momentum @xmath19 in the lowest energy band , is very broad and varies slowly in position space .",
    "let us assume for the moment that no transverse excitations are produced .",
    "then one can make the ansatz @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a quasiperiodic ( bloch ) eigenfunction of @xmath22 with quasimomentum @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath23 denotes the transverse ground state of the trapping potential .",
    "the ( dimensionless ) function @xmath24 is an envelope which describes the large scale features of the wavefunction , whereas the small - scale features are included in @xmath21 .",
    "the basic idea of our approach is to average over the small spatial scales and to derive an effective equation for the large - scale behaviour of the wavefunction , i.e. , for the envelope @xmath24 .",
    "before we can start to derive an effective equation , the ansatz ( [ eq : simpleansatz ] ) has to be generalized in two aspects .",
    "first , since our aim includes to describe the adiabatic bloch oscillation from the lower to the upper band edge , we can not assume that the quasimomentum is fixed , but have to admit a time - dependent @xmath25 .",
    "secondly , we have to take into account transverse resonances which appear if @xmath25 is in the vicinity of the upper band edge ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : modescheme ] ) .",
    "numerical investigations suggest that it is sufficient to include the two nearest resonances only , because all other resonances are negligibly populated .",
    "therefore , the ansatz ( [ eq : simpleansatz ] ) needs to be modified to @xmath26 where , for our purposes , @xmath27 runs from 0 to 2 , @xmath28 denotes the quasimomentum around which each of the three modes is centered , and @xmath29 represents the transverse excitation number ( @xmath30 since , by symmetry , only even levels can be excited @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath31 is a slowly varying envelope function for each of the three modes .    to derive an effective equation for the envelopes , we average over the small spatial scale set by the lattice length @xmath32 . following standard methods",
    ", we introduce an averaging function @xmath33 which is slowly varying on the scale of @xmath34 , has a narrow support whose width corresponds to the resolution of the effective equation , and which is normalized to one , @xmath35",
    ". the width of @xmath36 should be much smaller than the scale on which the envelopes @xmath31 are varying .",
    "a function @xmath37 is then averaged by calculating @xmath38 . with this method",
    ", the envelopes can be extracted from the wavefunction by evaluating @xmath39 where we have used that @xmath40 is approximately constant over the support of @xmath36 and where the time dependence , for brevity , is dropped out .",
    "the integral in the last line can be evaluated as follows : for @xmath41 the function @xmath42 is periodic with period @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 since the bloch functions are normalized ( @xmath44 is the quantization length ) .",
    "since @xmath36 is roughly constant on the scale of @xmath34 , we find , by cutting the integral into bits of length @xmath34 , @xmath45 since the sum is just the discretized expression for a riemannian integral over @xmath36 with @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , consider first the case that the width @xmath48 of @xmath36 is very large , @xmath49 .",
    "then the integral is simply the scalar product between the two modes and therefore zero unless @xmath50 . for sufficiently large @xmath48 ,",
    "the integral is still approximately zero if @xmath28 and @xmath51 are not too close to each other , since the product of the bloch wavefunctions then oscillates rapidly and averages to zero .",
    "assuming that this is the case we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq : integraleval ] ) @xmath52 when we apply the same procedure ( projecting onto the transverse modes and averaging over the longitudinal part ) to the gpe and insert the ansatz ( [ eq : fullansatz ] ) , we are led to @xmath53 with the usual interaction mode integrals @xmath54 a dot denotes the derivative with respect to time . in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deriv1 ] ) we have exploited the fact that the averaging over the interaction integrals can be done in much the same way as for eq .",
    "( [ eq : integraleval ] ) : the averaged interaction integrals are again either periodic or rapidly oscillating and therefore do essentially acquire a factor @xmath55 , which we have multiplied out in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deriv1 ] ) .    the last line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deriv1 ] ) deserves a comment .",
    "the homogeneous potential term @xmath56 simply survives the averaging procedure and is a direct consequence of the corresponding term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe ] ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath57 arises from the time derivative on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe ] ) which includes a term of the form @xmath58 .",
    "it is not hard to see that , provided the assumption that the wavepacket remains in the lowest energy band holds true , the derivative with respect to the quasi momentum can be approximated by @xmath59 .",
    "the term is then of the same form as the homogeneous force and can be averaged in the same way .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of a simple bloch oscillation caused by the homogeneous force we have @xmath60 so that the linear potential is cancelled .",
    "this is nothing but a different description of the fact that a bloch oscillation simply corresponds to a shift of a wavepacket in quasimomentum space , again under the condition that no higher bands are populated .",
    "this is the case for the main wavepacket in fig .",
    "[ fig : modescheme ] for which the time dependence of its quasimomentum @xmath19 is simply a consequence of the induced bloch oscillation .",
    "however , for the modes @xmath61 and @xmath62 the time dependence of the quasimomenta is determined by a resonance condition and is not directly related to the bloch oscillation .",
    "hence , these two modes are subject to a renormalized homogeneous force .    to perform the averaging over the longitudinal hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deriv1 ] ) , we employ the well - known effective - mass method from solid state theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using that @xmath63 is narrowly localized around quasi momentum @xmath28 we can expand this expression in terms of bloch wave functions @xmath64 , which are eigenfunctions of @xmath22 with eigenvalues @xmath65 .",
    "the eigenvalue can be expanded to second order in @xmath66 , resulting in @xmath67 in this equation , we introduced two important physical parameters : the group velocity @xmath68 and the effective mass @xmath69 . introducing the function",
    "@xmath70 it is easy to see that the action of @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath71 with the effective hamiltonian @xmath72 this allows us to write the averaged hamiltonian action appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deriv1 ] ) in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the periodic bloch wavefunctions , @xmath75 .",
    "because of the averaging , we are interested in distances @xmath76 much larger than @xmath34 . in this case , the phase factor in the integral over @xmath66 varies much faster with @xmath66 than the periodic bloch function @xmath77 . we therefore can replace the latter by @xmath78 .",
    "the integral over @xmath66 then becomes , on scales much larger than @xmath34 , the delta function @xmath79 and we arrive at @xmath80    the last step in our derivation of effective equations for the envelope functions @xmath40 is to show that @xmath31 and @xmath81 are , on average , equal .",
    "to do so , we first note that @xmath82 since @xmath31 is slowly varying . inverting eq.([eq : atilde ] )",
    ", we can rewrite this as @xmath83 it is then possible to repeat the argument given above for the action of @xmath84 . writing the quasiperiodic bloch functions @xmath85 in terms of the periodic bloch functions @xmath74",
    ", we again find a rapidly oscillating exponential in @xmath66 which results in a spatial delta function for large scales .",
    "integrating this we find @xmath86 using this identity we find for the effective equation describing the large scale dynamics of the envelopes @xmath87 for the case of a single wave packet centered around a fixed quasimomentum , an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : effeq ] ) has also been derived using multiple - scale perturbation theory in the context of nonlinear optics @xcite and atom optics @xcite .",
    "we have chosen a different approach since the inclusion of time - dependent quasi momenta is more obvious using the averaging method . in the following sections we will apply this equation to examine the conditions under which gap solitons can be formed and how they evolve in time .",
    "a major advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : effeq ] ) , compared to the full gpe , is the simple form of the effective hamiltonians @xmath88 .",
    "it describes interacting particles in a homogeneous external potential with different masses and velocities .",
    "this allows us to find a simplified analytical description and thus to gain more insight in the dynamics of a bec in an optical lattice .",
    "numerical simulations of the full gpe indicate that for each mode the wavepacket remains localized around @xmath28 for a long time if the optical lattice is not too deep .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the wavepackets can approximately be described as gaussian wavepackets and to make a variational ansatz for them . following the technique described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we first observe that eq .",
    "( [ eq : effeq ] ) can formally be derived from the lagrangean @xmath89 a consistent variational ansatz for gaussian envelopes is achieved by setting @xmath90 this describes a wavepacket of width @xmath91 and amplitude @xmath92 ( having dimensions of length@xmath93 so that @xmath31 is dimensionless ) .",
    "it is spatially localized around @xmath94 and has an instantaneous energy of @xmath95 .",
    "its mean velocity and its variance are given by @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "inserting this ansatz for the envelopes in the lagrangean and extremizing the corresponding action integral , we derived a set of 18 equations which describe the evolution of the three gaussian wavepackets involved .",
    "this task , as well as the algebraic manipulations following below , are rather tedious and therefore have been completed using mathematica @xcite . since the variational equations are somewhat lengthy we exploited the special features of our system to reduce its complexity . to do so ,",
    "we restrict our considerations to the case when the wavepackets are already at the upper band edge so that the quasi momenta are time - independent and given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 as well as @xmath100 , where @xmath7 is the wavenumber of the optical lattice which appears in the optical potential ( [ eq : vopt ] ) .",
    "@xmath101 is identical to @xmath102 .",
    "it can be derived from the resonance condition that the three energies @xmath103 for @xmath104 are equal . setting this energy to zero",
    "we can also omit the corresponding terms in the lagrangean .",
    "because the wavepackets are already at the upper band edge we will also not need the homogeneous force to induce bloch oscillations , i.e. , we set @xmath105 .",
    "the special values of the quasi momenta imply that most of the interaction integrals @xmath106 are zero or have an identical value .",
    "this can be seen by expanding the bloch wavefunctions in terms of momentum eigenstates , @xmath107 . by fourier transforming the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath108 , one finds the following equation for the expansion coefficients @xmath109 , @xmath110 this equation shows that the expansion coefficients are real and that , if @xmath111 is a solution , then so is @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we have the relation @xmath113    it is well known , and can be seen from the above expansion , that bloch wavefunctions are periodic up to a phase factor @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the three wavefunctions @xmath115 are oscillating with a phase factor @xmath116 relative to each other . in the limit of an infinite optical lattice ,",
    "the interaction integral @xmath106 will therefore vanish if these phase factors do not exactly cancel each other .",
    "for instance , @xmath117 because its integrand is proportional to @xmath118 , but @xmath119 .",
    "this , in combination with eq .",
    "( [ eq:1equal2 ] ) , ensures that all interaction integrals , except @xmath120 and @xmath121 as well as @xmath122 , do vanish ( in addition , the symmetries @xmath123 and @xmath124 have to be taken into account ) .",
    "thus , there are only three independent interaction parameters which we will denote by @xmath125 even with these simplifications the resulting equations are still very lengthy , but they admit the analysis of symmetric solutions . by symmetry",
    ", we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 for the group velocities of the wavepacket , and @xmath128 for the effective masses . under these conditions",
    "one can show that @xmath129 and @xmath130 are solutions of the variational equations .",
    "this result is intuitively clear and just means that the central wavepacket remains at the upper band edge with mean position and velocity zero . in addition",
    ", symmetry implies that the two transversally excited wavepackets should evolve in an identical way , but with opposite mean velocities ( because their group velocities differ by a sign ) .",
    "we therefore can set @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , @xmath136 , which reduces the number of independent variational parameters to ten ( four for @xmath19 and six for @xmath61 ) .",

    "_ initially empty transverse excited modes : _ a surprising consequence of the variational equations can be seen immediately : it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : a0dot ] ) that , when all atoms are in the central wavepacket ( @xmath155 ) , the amplitude @xmath156 and therefore also @xmath157 will not change in time . thus , the transversally excited wavepackets would never be populated .",
    "this prediction is a direct consequence of the assumption @xmath158 and in striking contradiction to the numerical results of ref .",
    "this difference can be resolved when one recalls the conditions under which our analytical theory is valid .",
    "@xmath117 is exactly fullfilled only in the limit of an infinite optical lattice . in a finite lattice",
    "the fact ( discussed above ) that the integrand is oscillating with a phase factor of @xmath159 only leads to oscillations of @xmath160 , so that it is zero on average only .",
    "since our wavepackets have a finite width in quasimomentum space , there will be a finite excitation probability even when @xmath155 initially .",
    "in addition , our theory assumes that the three wavepackets are not overlapping in quasimomentum space , since only under this condition the averaging method can yield reasonable results . in practice , this is not exactly fulfilled and will lead to corrections to the prediction of the averaged equations . however , the time scale for transverse excitation out of a central wavepacket is quite large ( typically about 70 ms @xcite ) so that the averaged equations should provide a valid description for shorter times .",
    "in fact , the present considerations may provide another reason for the long time scales for transverse excitations .",
    "in addition , during the preparation of the wavepacket at the upper band edge through bloch oscillations , the transversally excited modes are populated .",
    "therefore , an initial condition with @xmath161 is realistic when we describe a system that already is prepared at the upper band edge .    on the other hand , when using the initial condition @xmath162 we are left with a theory for the central wavepacket only , since there are never any transversally excited atoms to interact with . in this case",
    "our description reduces to the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( but with a negative effective mass ) so that one can transfer most of the results to our case .",
    "we therefore will not discuss it further .",
    "_ case of three initial gap solitons : _ another case of interest is the case when all three wavepackets are initially forming independent gap solitons .",
    "that is , in the absence of mutual interactions each of the three envelopes corresponds to a stationary solution of the variational equations with self - interaction .",
    "we can find these solutions by setting @xmath163 and removing the terms proportional to @xmath164 , which describe the interaction between wavepacket @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see above ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case the soliton solution is given by @xmath165 and @xmath166 as well as @xmath167 the question remains whether this solution is stable against the presence of the mutual interactions of the three gap solitions . to answer it",
    ", we have made a stability analysis by linearizing the variational equations in the deviations from the soliton solution ( [ eq : gapsolsolw ] ) , ( [ eq : gapsolsolf ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath168 ( and similarly for the other dynamical variables ) and consider all equations only to first order in @xmath169 , whereby the mutual interaction terms are treated as of first order in @xmath169 .",
    "this is justified since these terms all include a factor which exponentially decays in time and thus have limited influence .",
    "such a factor arises because the three wavepackets all have different group velocities and thus separate after a short time , the exponential being a consequence of the overlap between the gaussian wavepackets .",
    "the resulting linearized equations are given by @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 the functions @xmath179 depend on the soliton solution parameters and increase at most polynomially ( degree less than 4 ) in time .",
    "they represent inhomogenities , similarly to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaa0 ] ) .",
    "because of the exponentially decaying factor , these terms are only important for times @xmath180 . therefore , to analyze the stability of the soliton solution , it is sufficient to solve the homogeneous linearized equations for a general set of initial conditions , since for large enough times this correctly describes the general solution .    to reduce the length of the linearized equations we have made an additional approximation .",
    "our numerical simulations of the full gpe indicate that , after the bec has been transferred to the upper band edge , the number of atoms in the @xmath19 wavepacket is considerably larger than in the other two modes . since @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the initial number of atoms in each mode , one can see that @xmath183 and therefore @xmath184 . assuming that this is the case , we here present the linearized equations only to second order in the ratio @xmath185 .",
    "the general solution of the homogeneous linearized equations is not hard to find .",
    "one immediately sees that @xmath186 and therefore , because of atom number conservation , also @xmath187 are constant in time .",

    "( [ eq : deltaw0 ] ) and ( [ eq : deltag0 ] ) are easily solved . @xmath188 and @xmath189",

    "( [ eq : deltaf0 ] ) for the homogeneous phase factor .",
    "the latter then grows in time , in addition to some oscillating factors , proportional to @xmath190 . when this expression is compared to the evolution of the solition phase factor ( [ eq : gapsolsolf ] ) it becomes obvious that this linear increase in @xmath191 just corresponds to a small deviation , proportional to @xmath192 , from the unperturbed energy of the soliton .",
    "we therefore have shown that the central soliton around quasi momentum @xmath19 is stable against the interaction with the other two wavepackets since its stability does also not depend on the evolution of the deviations in these wavepackets .",
    "the situation is quite different for the transversally excited modes . repeating the steps leading to the solution for the central wavepacket",
    ", one can see that the solution for @xmath193 is given by @xmath194 with @xmath195 .",
    "this growing oscillatory behaviour clearly indicates instability against any initial deviations @xmath196 , which unavoidably are introduced by the interaction between the three wavepackets .",
    "it is worth to examine the origin of this instability more closely .",
    "our arguments are based on the fact that the two transversally excited wavepackets move away from the central wavepacket .",
    "this happens because we have set @xmath197 for the excited wavepackets , so that they propagate with the group velocity @xmath198 .",
    "hence , after some time the wavepackets are separated , so that the mutual interaction disappears and can not cause instability anymore .",
    "however , setting @xmath199 in absence of mutual interactions creates another source of instability : even in a strictly one - dimensional situation , a gap ( or bright ) soliton with non - vanishing group velocity is only stable a wavepacket characterized by eqns .",
    "( [ eq : gapsolsolw ] ) and ( [ eq : gapsolsolf ] ) is still a stationary solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , but it is not stable . ] if the phase factor exactly matches the group velocity , @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , the instability of the transversally excited wavepackets is the same as that of an isolated gap soliton with the wrong phase factor .",
    "the only possibility to avoid this kind of instability is to choose the appropriate phase factors @xmath201 . as a consequence",
    ", the excited wavepackets would remain at their original position so that the mutual interaction would not decrease .",
    "since the latter is a resonant coupling between the three wavepackets a general superposition of three gap solitons would not correspond to a stationary solution anymore . in the next section",
    "we will demonstrate that for a particular choice of parameters this problem can be overcome .",
    "a particularly interesting situation appears when one tries to construct stationary wavepackets which remain spatially localized around @xmath202 . as is evident from eq .",

    "interestingly , this condition also guarantees the validity of @xmath204 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b1dot ] ) , so that this requirement is self - consistent .",

    "is @xmath208 and @xmath209 , whereby the latter assumption also ensures that the widths of the wavepackets remain constant . a necessary condition for this to hold are the equations @xmath210    using eqns .",
    "( [ eq : g0dot ] ) - ( [ eq : f1dot ] ) this leads to algebraic conditions on the widths and populations of the three modes . the simplest way to solve these algebraic conditions is to , first , fix the ratio between the widths according to @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is some positive number .",
    "in addition , we write @xmath213 so that @xmath214 is independent of the total number of atoms @xmath15 and remains finite when the quantization length @xmath44 goes to infinity .",
    "for these settings we derived solutions of the algebraic conditions which determine @xmath15 , @xmath215 , and the population distribution among the modes as a function of @xmath212 , @xmath214 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 .",
    "a particularly nice example is the case when all three wavepackets have equal width , @xmath218 .",
    "the solution then becomes very compact and is given by @xmath219 with @xmath220 and @xmath221 being independent from the number of atoms and the quantization length .",
    "the state characterized by eqs .",
    "( [ tsa1])-([tsw1 ] ) , which we will refer to as `` triple soliton '' , represents a special coherent superposition of a wavepacket in the transverse ground state at the upper band edge of the optical lattice , and two wavepackets around the transverse resonances .",
    "the special choice ( [ tsa1])-([tsw1 ] ) for the parameters ensures that the mutual and self - interaction of the wavepackets exactly cancel the dispersion of each wavepacket due to its negative effective mass .",
    "it also guarantees , within the approximation that only two resonances are taken into account , that the triple soliton does not spread in the transverse direction .",
    "it therefore can be seen as a generalization of the gap soliton which is unstable against transverse decay .",
    "it differs from the case of a superposition of three gap - soliton wavepackets discussed above in that the mutual interaction between the wavepackets destroys the latter .",
    "this is because the stability criterion ( [ eq : gapsolsolw ] ) and ( [ eq : gapsolsolf ] ) takes only into account the self - interaction of each of the three wavepackets . for the triple soliton the mutual interaction",
    "is included as well .",
    "a very interesting feature of the triple soliton is that the width of the soliton does not depend in any way on the interaction parameters of the system .",
    "it is solely determined by the structure of the lowest energy band of the optical lattice and in particular is proportional to the de broglie wavelength of a particle of mass @xmath222 moving with the velocity @xmath217 .",
    "the number @xmath15 of atoms in the soliton depends on the interaction parameters , but it vanishes if the group velocity @xmath217 of the transverse resonances goes to zero , i.e. , if the resonances are close to the band edge .",
    "the population of the three modes depends on the interaction and leads to consistency requirements : since @xmath223 can only take values between 0 and @xmath44 we find that the soliton can only exist if the effective masses fulfill the inequality @xmath224    to see if this condition can be fullfilled , we have numerically calculated the band structure for a bec in a periodic potential of the form @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is the laser s wavenumber and @xmath18 the depth of the optical lattice , which we will give in units of the recoil energy @xmath227 with the recoil velocity @xmath228 .",
    "we consider @xmath0rb atoms ( @xmath229 kg , @xmath230 nm ) in an optical lattice driven by a laser close to the d2 line ( @xmath231 nm ) and a 2-dimensional transverse harmonic trap of strength @xmath232 .",
    "the effective mass , the group velocity , and the interaction parameters as a function of @xmath18 are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : intparams ] , respectively . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : effmasses ] b ) condition ( [ eq : masscond ] ) can be fulfilled in this parameter regime , which also lies well within the range of current experiments @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : solparams ] we have plotted the width as well as the number of atoms and population distribution for the novel kind of soliton . for the case @xmath233 under consideration , the population in the transversally excited modes is larger than that of the central wavepacket .",
    "using an averaging method we have derived effective field equations which describe the large - scale behaviour of a transversally confined bec in a one - dimensional optical lattice . due to the existence of transversally excited modes resonant to wavepackets in the transverse ground state ,",
    "these equations have the structure of coupled one - dimensional particles with different effective masses and dynamical interaction parameters .",
    "we have made a gaussian ansatz for the envelopes of a wavepacket prepared at the upper band edge and the two nearest resonances in quasi - momentum space .",
    "variational equations for this ansatz are derived and several solutions are discussed , including a novel kind of `` triple '' soliton .    *",
