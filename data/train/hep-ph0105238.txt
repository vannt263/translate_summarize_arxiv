    "the @xmath9 local gauge symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) determines completely the triple and quartic vector  boson interactions .",
    "therefore , the direct study of these couplings can further confirm the sm or give some hint on the existence of new phenomena at a higher scale .",

    "this is the case when the breaking of the @xmath5 symmetry takes place via the higgs mechanism with a relatively light elementary higgs boson . if , on the other hand , no fundamental light higgs particle is present in the theory , one is led to consider the most general effective lagrangian which employs a nonlinear representation of the broken @xmath5 gauge symmetry @xcite . in this case",
    "the sm relation between the structure of the three and four  point functions of the gauge bosons does not hold already at @xmath6 order , leaving open the question of the structure of the quartic vector  boson interactions .",
    "lc provides a unique possibility to study @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions since high energy photons can be produced by laser backscattering @xcite .",

    "we access the reach of the lc operating in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes to study the symmetry breaking sector via the measurement of quartic gauge couplings .",
    "we work in the framework of chiral lagrangians , and we analyze all @xmath6 operators that lead to genuine quartic gauge interactions , _ i.e. _ these operators do not give rise to triple gauge  boson vertices , and consequently are not bounded by the study of the production of gauge  boson pairs .",
    "we also take into account realistic cuts , detection efficiencies and potential backgrounds .    at present the only information on quartic couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 is obtained indirectly as they modify the gauge  boson two  point functions at one loop @xcite .",

    "we show that the lc operating in the @xmath1 or @xmath2 modes not only can establish the existence of a strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector but also can lead to bounds on genuine quartic interactions of the order of @xmath7 which turn out to be of the same order of magnitude of the attainable limits at the lhc and @xmath0 lc .",
    "furthermore , the information gathered in the @xmath8 mode can be used to reduced the ambiguities of the @xmath0 mode , which exhibits two allowed regions , leading to a better determination of the quartic couplings .",
