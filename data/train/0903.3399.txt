    "experimental results from rhic have established the formation of hot and dense matter of a fundamentally new nature in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at @xmath5 gev  @xcite .",
    "energy loss in this dense nuclear matter by color - charged , hard ( e @xmath6 gev ) partons , and the jets into which they fragment , is generally accepted to be the mechanism responsible for the suppression of the high-  hadron yields observed in central a+a collisions  @xcite . in the large multiplicity environment of heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "two - particle correlations are often used to study jet modification and to infer properties of the medium .",
    "for example , high-  azimuthal dihadron correlations demonstrate that the degree of dijet away - side suppression depends on the  of the `` trigger '' and `` associated '' hadrons . at moderate  ( @xmath7 gev / c ) , the jet properties measured through two - particle correlations demonstrate novel features such as shape modifications which are thought to be a manifestation of the response of medium to the energy deposited by the attenuated parton  @xcite .",
    "di - hadron measurements of dijet pairs provide an ambiguous measurement of the energy loss of the away - side parton .",
    "the trigger hadron is a product of parton fragmentation and therefore it is not possible to determine , event - by - event , whether the near - side parton has itself lost energy .",
    "given the steeply falling jet spectrum , the sample of hard scatterings is biased towards configurations in which the parton loses little energy . in particular",
    ", it is believed that hadron measurements are subject to a `` surface bias '' in which the hard scatterings sampled are likely to occur at the periphery of the overlap zone @xcite .",
    "the away - side parton then is more likely to traverse a maximal path - length through the medium . for a sufficiently opaque medium",
    ", the attenuation of the parton may be nearly total , in which case the sensitivity to the average path - length is reduced  @xcite . back - to - back , high-  hadron pairs may originate preferentially from configurations in which the outgoing parton trajectories are tangential to the surface of the overlap zone  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "dihadron pairs may also originate from vertices deep in the collision zone if a parton has a finite probability to `` punch - through '' or pass through the medium without interaction  @xcite .",
    "calculations of the relative importance of these two mechanisms depend both on the model of parton energy loss employed and the density profile of the medium  @xcite .",
    "direct photon - jet pairs offer two major advantages in studying energy loss as compared to dijets because of the nature of the photon .",
    "first , in contrast to partons , photons do not carry color charge and hence do not interact strongly when traversing the medium  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of hard scattering vertices sampled by direct photon - triggered correlations is thus unbiased by the trigger condition .",
    "suppression of the opposite jet is averaged over all path - lengths given by the distribution of hard scattering vertices .",
    "second , at the born level , direct photon production in @xmath0+@xmath0 and a+a collisions is dominated by the qcd compton scattering process , @xmath8+@xmath9+@xmath1 , and the photon momentum in the center - of - mass frame is exactly balanced by that of the recoil quark .",
    "although higher order effects and other complications to this idealized picture such as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath10  fragmentation \" photons or soft gluon radiation must be considered , the level of suppression can then be related directly to the energy loss of a parton of known initial momentum . in this way , the average path - length of the away - side parton",
    "may then be varied in a well controlled manner by selecting events of various momentum differences between the @xmath1-@xmath2 pair .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath1+jet channel has long been considered the `` golden channel '' for studying parton energy loss @xcite . neglecting the above mentioned complications , specifically effects like transverse momentum broadening ( the @xmath11 effect ) and parton - to - photon fragmentation , back - to - back @xmath1-@xmath2 correlations in elementary collisions directly measure the fragmentation function of the recoil jet since @xmath12 . in the standard picture of energy loss , partons are likely to lose some fraction of their energy in the medium , but are likely to fragment outside the medium . hence , the parton energy loss can be considered an effective modification to the fragmentation function .",
    "such a picture may be tested using @xmath1-@xmath2 correlations in nuclear collisions .",
    "complementary baseline measurements in @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions are used to test the theoretical description of correlations in vacuum and to constrain possible contributions from higher order processes .",
    "comprehensive reviews of direct photon phenomenology and data from elementary collisions may be found in @xcite .",
    "the data were taken with the phenix detector @xcite using approximately 950 million au+au minimum bias events from the 2004 data set and 471 million photon - triggered events from the 2005 and 2006 @xmath0+@xmath0 data sets corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3 ( 2005 ) and 10.7 ( 2006 ) pb@xmath13 .",
    "the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite , which are used to trigger the minimum bias data , select 92% of the total inelastic cross section . in au+au the bbc and zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) were used for offline minimum bias event selection and centrality determination . in @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions a high energy photon trigger , defined by coincidence between the bbc and a high energy electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) tower hit ,",
    "was utilized .",
    "this emcal based trigger @xcite had an efficiency of @xmath14 90% for events with photons and   with energies in the range used in the analysis and within the detector s geometric acceptance .",

    "the fine segmentation of the emcal ( @xmath19 for pbsc and @xmath20 for pbgl ) allows for the reconstruction of @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s in the @xmath23 decay channel out to  of 20 gev / c .",

    "gev / c there is a @xmath28% contribution of merged  cluster contamination , however this together with all sources of non - photon contamination are found to have a negligible impact on the two - particle correlation analysis of this report .",
    "direct photons and their two - particle correlations are obtained by statistical subtraction of the estimated meson ( mainly ) decay photon contribution from the inclusive photon and @xmath1-@xmath2 samples .",
    "charged hadrons are detected with the phenix tracking system @xcite which employs a drift chamber in each arm spanning a radial distance of 2.02.4 m from the beam axis with a set of pixel pad chambers ( pc1 ) directly behind them .",
    "the momentum resolution was determined to be @xmath29 where @xmath0 is measured in gev / c .",
    "secondary tracks from decays and conversions are suppressed by matching tracks to hits in a second pad chamber ( pc3 ) at distance of @xmath30 m. track projections to the emcal plane are used to veto photon candidates resulting from charged hadrons that shower in the emcal .",
    "two - particle correlations are constructed by measuring the yield of particle pairs as a function of the measured azimuthal angle between photon or parent meson triggers and charged hadron partners .",
    "the correlation function , @xmath31 , corrects for the limited acceptance of @xmath1-@xmath2 or meson - hadron pairs by dividing the distribution in real events @xmath32 by the mixed event distribution @xmath33 .",
    "the correlation function is decomposed utilizing a two - source model of pair yields coming from two - particle jet correlations superimposed on a combinatorial background yield from an underlying event .",
    "the underlying event in au+au is known to have an azimuthal asymmetry of harmonic shape quantified in the elliptic flow parameter @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this flow represents a harmonic modulation of the  distribution of this underlying event , such that the flow - subtracted jet correlation signal is encoded in the jet pair ratio function , @xmath35 , using the notation of @xcite , where @xmath36 is the average single - particle @xmath34 .",
    "two methods of determining the background level @xmath37 , known as zero - yield at minimum ( zyam ) and absolute normalization ( abs ) respectively were applied to the au+au data .",
    "both methods are described in detail in previous phenix publications  @xcite , see also  @xcite ( abs ) and  @xcite ( zyam ) .",
    "zyam assigns the level of zero jet yield and hence @xmath37 to the minimum point of the correlation function @xmath38 .",
    "the abs method uses the mean multiplicity of trigger - associated pairs in mixed events and a correction for finite centrality resolution to determine @xmath37 .",
    "where zyam statistical precision is reasonable , the direct @xmath1-h extraction of the two methods agree to within much better than the total uncertainties , typically within @xmath39% .",
    "the abs method is chosen for the au+au results presented , as this method resulted in a more precise extraction of direct photon - jet pair yields at high trigger  where lack of statistics near @xmath40 severely impairs the zyam determination . in the comparatively low multiplicity @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions",
    ", the underlying event originates from different physical mechanisms than in au+au and is known not to be well described by event - mixing . instead the correlation functions are normalized by fitting to a double gaussian + constant function , corresponding to the zyam method @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are corrected for the associated charged hadron efficiency @xmath41 such that the quoted yields correspond to a detector with full azimuthal acceptance and @xmath42 coverage .",
    "no correction is applied for the @xmath43 acceptance of pairs .",
    "final results are presented in terms of the yield @xmath44 of jet pairs per trigger , @xmath45 with the constant @xmath46 .",
    "the magnitudes of elliptic flow were determined by measuring the distributions of inclusive photons , neutral pions , and charged hadrons as a function of the angle relative to the reaction plane , which was determined with the bbc s as described in @xcite .",
    "the  values measured for this analysis are consistent with previous phenix analyses @xcite . at high-  ( @xmath47",

    "such a procedure has not yet been demonstrated in central au+au data , although doing so would help to eliminate beyond - leading - order effects .",
    "we have presented the first direct @xmath1-h measurements in au+au and @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions at rhic .",
    "a significant suppression of @xmath71 for the away - side charged hadron yield in the range @xmath105 gev / c is observed for direct photon triggers in au+au as compared to @xmath0+@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the level of suppression is found to be consistent with the single particle suppression rate and the importance of energy - loss geometry , notably the expectation of surface emission in the kinematic range sampled .",
    "a possible indication that energy - loss geometry may also be important in dijet suppression is that @xmath1-@xmath2 suppression @xmath60 is also observed to be quite similar to that of dihadron suppression in central events ; however , the current precision of the data does not exclude substantial differences . in the @xmath0+@xmath0 data @xmath80 scaling",
    "is observed , suggesting that the measured @xmath80 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xe ] ) is a statistically acceptable representation of the fragmentation function of the quark jet recoiling away from the direct photon .",
    "improvement of the statistical and systematic precision of the measurements should allow further tests of vacuum fragmentation expectations in p+p collisions and insights into details of the medium modification of jet fragmentation in au+au .",
