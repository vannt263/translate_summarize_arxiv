    "the reaction rate of 3@xmath8 process is known to have an uncertainty about 10%  @xcite , at the astrophysical temperatures ( 0.2@xmath9@xmath10 k ) ; while such accuracy is not the case for @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2oreaction yet relevant for the rise time of the type i supernova light curves  @xcite , the production of important radioactive nuclei @xmath11al , @xmath12ti , and @xmath13fe  @xcite , the size and mass of fe core for a pre - supernova star  @xcite , and the formation of x - ray black hole binaries  @xcite and neutron star  @xcite in massive stars .",
    "experimental investigations on the reaction rate @xmath14 are calculated with the following standard formula  @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 refers to the avogadro s constant , @xmath17 is the reduced mass of entrance channel @xmath0c+@xmath18 , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath20 is the gamow energy with the fine - structure constant @xmath18 .",
    "the function s(e)= @xmath21 is the total s factor of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o , where @xmath22 = @xmath23 is the sommerfeld parameter , and @xmath24 is the cross section .",
    "for each temperature of @xmath4 ( temperature in units of 10@xmath25 k ) , the rate is obtained by eq.(1 ) with corresponding data of the s(e ) factor .",
    "the difficulty in measuring the s factor of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction results from the extremely small @xmath26(@xmath27 ) , which is about @xmath28 b at 0.3 mev , where the helium burning occurs .",
    "the observed s(e ) factors are focused on the energy region of @xmath29 0.9 mev , which means that an extrapolation can not be evaded at the present . it remains a challenging task to obtain the s(e ) factor for the @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction in part due to the complicated level structure of @xmath2o nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction rates at astrophysical temperatures are dominated by resonances states in the compound nucleus @xmath2o .",
    "the rates based upon the different extrapolation and fitting models to the parts of existing s(e ) factors measurements , such as the potential models and @xmath30-matrix ( or @xmath31-matrix ) theory , were reported by several research teams .",
    "representative results for the rates from @xmath30-matrix ( or @xmath31-matrix ) theory were provided by @xcite ( hereafter cf88 ) ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ( hereafter nacre ) , and @xcite .",

    ". these complementary data effectively help us to understand the concrete effect of the @xmath2o nucleus for the s(e ) factor and the reaction rate . based on",
    "the published s factor estimates , the updated astrophysical reaction rates of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o are presented and compared with the previous published reaction rates in this paper .",
    "the s factors of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o is constituted by several resonant peaks with strong interference pattern . and",
    "the complicated mechanism of this reaction results in unpredictable interference effects from the first principles @xcite .",
    "the global fitting for @xmath2o system with a multilevel , multichannel @xmath30-matrix allows simultaneous analysis of differential cross section data and angle - integrated cross section of @xmath2o compound nucleus  @xcite .",
    "multichannel @xmath30-matrix analysis provides the possibility of reducing the uncertainties in the extrapolated total and partial s factors of @xmath32c(@xmath8 , @xmath33)@xmath34o reaction , and the interpretation of interference mechanism via additional constraint offered by the simultaneous analysis of multiple reaction channels  @xcite .",

    "we adopt a similar approach for the fitting of cascade transitions .",
    "this is one of the reasons that uncertainty of the extrapolated s factor reduces dramatically .",
    "the values of other two cascade transitions are s@xmath42(0.3 mev ) = 0.63 @xmath5 0.22 kev b and s@xmath43(0.3 mev ) = 3.00 @xmath5 0.42 kev b , which are in excellent agreement with recent results of @xcite , respectively .",

    "as @xmath27 and @xmath49 increase with stellar temperature , the s(e ) factor data in the higher energy range play a leading role gradually for the reaction rate .    to understand influence of the s(e ) factor of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o on the reaction rate at different temperatures , probability density functions of the total reaction rates at @xmath4",

    "= 0.2 and 1.0 , the probability density functions are located almost in the extrapolated s factor , without resonance peaks , so the gamow window can be well approximated by a gaussian - distribution with the most effective energy @xmath51 = 0.3 mev and @xmath51 = 0.9 mev . as the @xmath4 increases from 1 to 10 , however , the influence of resonances of s(e ) factor becomes more and more remarkable , and",
    "the probability density functions can no longer be approximated by the gaussian - distribution .",
    "so , @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction rate at these temperatures can be obtained just by the s factor measurements at energies as wide as possible .",
    "the s@xmath35 measurements of @xcite , in reverse kinematics using the recoil mass separator allowed to acquire data with a high degree of accuracy ( @xmath523% ) in a wide energy scope of @xmath53 = 1.5 - 4.9 mev .",
    "these data would make good restriction to probability density functions of @xmath4 = 2.0 , 3.0 , and 4.0 ( fig .",
    "1c-1e ) , and uncertainties of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction rate are smaller than 3% from 2.0 @xmath44 4.0 .",

    "the published data in two independent experiments  @xcite of the ground - state transition were neglected .",
    "possible interference effects were included in the calculation of s@xmath36 and s@xmath37 by applying the @xmath30-matrix fitting procedures , but they were somewhat speculative , and the results of s@xmath57 were about 2@xmath585 times away from experimental data .",
    "therefore , from the probability density functions of @xmath4 = 5.0 , 6.0 , 8.0 and 10.0 ( fig .",
    "1f-1i ) , it can be inferred that the rate calculation of @xcite is significantly higher .",

    "1a-1c ) , we note that the contribution stems mainly from @xmath59 = @xmath61 ( @xmath55= 2.42 mev ) and @xmath59 = @xmath62 ( @xmath55= 2.58 mev ) levels in @xmath2o . the rate above @xmath4 = 2.0",
    ", the fraction from @xmath63 gradually increases with temperature .",

    "the contribution of @xmath59 = @xmath64 increases with @xmath4 first , and then decreases , having two @xmath64 resonances just at @xmath55= 3.20 and 3.93 mev in integral interval .",
    "thus , the fractional contributions of different values of @xmath59 reconfirmed the validity of the probability density functions in fig . 1 .",
    "the contributions of ground state capture and cascade captures to the reaction rate of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o are illustrated in fig .",
    "ground state capture ( s@xmath65 and s@xmath66 ) dominates the reaction rate up to @xmath4 = 0.1 . and the contributions from the cascade transitions increase with @xmath4 . beside at the important he - burning temperature @xmath4 = 0.2",
    ", the rate is still important all the way up to @xmath4 = 5.0 , because the inverse reaction of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o plays an important role in silicon burning  @xcite .",

    "the temperature dependence of our recommended value differs significantly from the rates of @xcite , which stems from the higher total s factor at @xmath69 ( @xmath70= 2.42 mev ) resonance - peak , overestimating the cross - section of @xcite in their calculations @xcite . in the same temperature range",
    ", the deviation from @xcite mainly originates from the lower calculation values of total s factor from @xmath70= 0.5 mev to @xmath70= 2.0 mev .",
    "the lower value of nacre is a direct consequence of the considered cascade transitions for the total s - factors .    for the rates above @xmath68 = 3 , our reaction rate increases with @xmath68",
    "but has lower values than @xcite and nacre ii , because the high - energy data covering the @xmath71 and @xmath72 resonance are overestimated apparently in their calculations .",
