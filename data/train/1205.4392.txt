    "collisionless shocks are of great interests in space physics , plasma physics and astrophysics since many theoretical , numerical and experimental studies have already evidenced that in the shock transition the bulk flow energy of plasmas is converted irreversibly into thermal energy @xcite . during the conversion process , the interaction between the electromagnetic fields and particles replaces the role played by collisions in a normal hydrodynamics . in quasi - perpendicular shocks ( @xmath1",
    ", @xmath2 is the angle between the upstream magnetic field and shock normal ) , the normal / cross shock electric field / potential plays an key role in both acceleration @xcite and thermalization @xcite of the incident particles . in - situ observations of the electric field at earth s bow shock provide important and unique experimental data that can be used to understand the details of plasma thermalization and energetic particle production in more general circumstances . @xcite",
    "experimentally studied the structure of the electric field profile during a number of crossings of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock using data from the cluster satellites .",
    "their results showed that the amplitude of the cross shock electric field appears to increase as @xmath2 approaching @xmath3 .",
    "based on cluster four - spacecraft observations , contributions to the electric field of the terrestrial bow shock are analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "they found that the hall term in the generalized ohm s law accounts for a majority of the normal electric field of supercritical , quasi - perpendicular shocks by two different methods : 1 .",
    "the single - spacecraft technique in which the shock is assumed as one - dimensional ( 1-d ) and stationary , and 2 .",
    "the curlometer technique @xcite which requires that the spacecraft are co - located in the shock ramp and the shock is stationary among the satellites .    both particle - in - cell(pic ) and hybrid simulations",
    "have clearly evidenced that supercritical , quasiperpendicular shocks are nonstationary and suffer a self - reformation on the local gyro scale of the incident ions @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the time evolution of the normal electric field and the fraction of reflected ions at the reforming shock front by using both pic simulation and semi - numerical model .",
    "their findings suggest that the reflected ions have a very coherent motion ( narrow ring ) as described by the so called trapping loop / vortex in the phase space ( @xmath4 ) at the beginning of the reflection .",
    "this coherent forces these ions to accumulate over a narrow spatial range at a foot length distance from the ramp ; it results that ramp and foot are well separated .",
    "this accumulation is suitable for building up a peaked - like normal electric field which itself reflects at later times new incoming ions at the foot before these reach the ramp .",
    "the peak of electric field produces an enhancement of local magnetic field . at last , a new ramp ( i.e. grown - up foot )",
    "is fully built up and substitute the old one .",
    "this process is periodic , and is named self - reformation .",
    "nonstationary characteristic of the shock front is later confirmed by an individual case study of cluster observation at the terrestrial bow shock @xcite .",
    "@xcite statistically confirms this robust characteristic .",
    "in addition , they found the magnetic field ramp of the shock often reaches a few @xmath5 , and the time variability of scales observed for the same upstream conditions is also a clear signature of the nonstationary shock front .    in recent study on collisionless magnetic reconnection .",
    "first , at the ion inertial length scale , ions and electrons are decoupled @xcite .",
    "the resulting hall effect determines the reconnection electric field .",
    "second , at the electron inertial scale , even the electrons are demagnetized , and the electric field is dominated by the off - diagonal electron pressure @xcite . in order to understand the physics in different scales ( e.g. the whole shock front is in ion inertial scale and the ramp is in electron inertial scale ) of the shock front structures of a supercritical , perpendicular shock , @xcite borrowed the same techniques which has been successfully applied to the research on collisionless magnetic reconnection .",
    "first , a pic simulation including all of the behaviors of ions and electrons were performed .",
    "nonstationary fields and corresponding particle dynamics were obtained self - consistently .",
    "second , contributions of lorentz , hall and electron pressure terms to the cross shock electric field were calculated by using the self - consistent particle data issued from the pic simulation .",
    "the main conclusions are the following : ( 1 ) the contributions of lorentz , hall and electron pressure terms to the cross shock electric field is evolving versus time .",
    "the electron pressure term within the shock front always contributes little ; ( 2 ) when the new ramp begins to be formed in front of the old ramp , the hall term becomes more and more important ; ( 3 ) the electric field @xmath0 is dominated by the hall term when the new ramp exceeds the old one .",
    "nevertheless , the shock front topology of a nonstationary shock can be modified by the local pickup ions ( pis ) .",
    "pickup ions are extensively and directly observed in the solar wind upstream of the earth s bow shock ( at @xmath61 au ) with the suleica instrument on aboard ampte / irm @xcite , around the shock associated with the corotating interaction region ( cir ) in the interplanetary space ( at @xmath64.5au ) with swics instrument onboard the ulysses spacecraft @xcite , and in the upstream of the halley comet bow shock with hers instrument on the giotto spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the production process and feature of the pickup ions in the solar wind have been studied quite well @xcite .",
    "neutral atoms and molecules , penetrating from the local interstellar medium or escaping from comets , are ionized by photoionization , electron impact or charge exchange with the solar wind . under the influence of the solar wind magnetic field",
    "the ions compose a ring - beam distribution in velocity space",
    ". then they are scattered by ambient and excited alfvnic fluctuations to form a spherical shell distribution .",
    "interstellar neutral hydrogen ( @xmath7 ) has a much higher density than other interstellar neutrals ; interstellar helium accounts for @xmath8 of the interstellar gas and its ionization rate is @xmath8 that of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the percentage of pickup ions to the solar wind ions ( sws ) at 50 au is estimated to be @xmath9 and increase linearly with distance from the sun @xcite .",
    "so the pickup @xmath7 is expected to be the dominant ( i.e. number density of pickup protons is @xmath10 that of the solar wind protons ) pickup species at the termination shock ( ts ) at about @xmath11 au @xcite .",
    "early 1-d hybrid simulations @xcite have revealed that an extended foot , which scales in reflection ion gyroradius , is seen on the supercritical shocks as a results of the reflected pickup ions .",
    "@xcite examined the effect of pickup ions on the heliospheric termination shock by using a 1-d pic code .",
    "they found the pickup ions in the extended foot causes an electric field in the shock normal direction .",
    "this leads to a large increase of the shock potential barrier upstream of the magnetic field ramp .",
    "however , the impact of pickup ions on the self - reformation process and contributions to the cross shock electric field at nonstationary shocks has not been analyzed yet .",
    "this gave us the motivation for investigating the impact of pis on the relative contributions of pis and solar wind ions ( sws ) respectively to the total normal electric field of the shock front .",
    "this paper represents an extension of a previous work @xcite .",
    "herein , we aim to address the following questions by using one - dimensional pic simulation ( the code treats the pickup ions self - consistently as a third component ) : ( 1 ) which term ( such as hall term and lorentz term ) in the generalized ohm s law accounts for a majority of the normal electric field of a supercritical , perpendicular shock in the presence of pickup ions ?",
    "does it vary versus time ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the contributions of pickup ions and solar wind ions to the terms mentioned above ? ( 3 ) how is this impact according to different percentages of upstream pickup ions on this competition ?",

    "thick curve @xmath86 indicates the shock profile that is chosen in the stack plots at the stationary shock with 55% pickup ions . ]    secondly , let us analyze the impact of high percentage pickup ions on the cross shock electric filed at a supercritical perpendicular shock .",
    "in the current case , the percentage of the pickup ions is set to 55% , and the other parameters of the simulation are kept unchanged .",
    "in contrast to the above results ( section 3.1 ) , a stationary shock can be demonstrated in figure 5 .",
    "this stationary , supercritical shock is characterized by an overshoot , a ramp and broad foot in front of the ramp . without loss of generality",
    ", we analyze the cross shock electric field @xmath0 at @xmath4710.4@xmath42 ( marked by",

    "the cyan and magenta highlight the regions : stationary foot and the nonstationary ramp , respectively . ]",
    "figure 6a-6c shows the snapshots of csp ( cross shock potential ) , @xmath73 and @xmath0 ( in black ) at shock profile @xmath86 ( at @xmath78 ) of a reforming shock , respectively . at this shock profile",
    ", the whole shock front can be divided into two parts : region i and region iii similar to that of shock profile c mentioned in section 3.1 .",
    "the shock ramp is at @xmath4866.58@xmath79 , and its width is about 0.19@xmath818.2@xmath5 .",
    "compare with the results described in section 3.1 , the amplitudes of the overshoot and cross shock electric field at shock profile @xmath86 ( i.e. at a stationary shock ) is much lower than that measured at a reforming shock , e.g. at profiles a ( figure 2 ) and c ( figure 4 ) .",
    "figure 6a shows the solar wind ions reflected at the shock ramp ( marked by vertical dashed in region iii ) can not form a clear vortex which is used as a key evidence of shock front self - reformation [ hada et al .",
    "figure 6b shows the density profiles of the pis ( blue ) , sws ( red ) and the total ions ( green ) , as in figure 4b . in region",
    "i , the total density profile is increased , and its shape is mainly controlled by pis .",
    "the density of sws exceeds that of pis in region iii .",
    "figure 6c and 6d shows the contributions of sws and pis to the hall term and lorentz term at the stationary shock ( profile @xmath86 ) are analogous to that obtained at the self - reforming shock ( e.g. profile c in figure 4 ) .",
    "the only difference is that the amplitude of the cross shock electric field @xmath0 in region iii is much lower , and the foot in region i is slightly higher .    in summary , high percentage pis leads to a stationary shock ( i.e. without self - reformation ) even in low @xmath87 case .",
    "this point already has been pointed out by @xcite in which they claimed that a shock becomes stationary even with 30% pis .",
    "the cross shock electric field @xmath0 in region i is still dominated by the lorentz term contributed by pis . in region iii , @xmath0 is still dominated by the the hall term contributed by sws .",
    "these two points are the same as that obtained at the steep and narrow shock profile ( e.g. profiles a or c ) in low percentage pis case ( i.e. nonstationary case ) .",
    "furthermore , low electromagnetic field within the shock front can not sustain the ion vortex in phase space .",
    "thus the region ii with feature of self - reformation disappears at this stationary shock .",
    "in this paper , we used 1-d pic simulations to study the contributions of the cross shock electric field in supercritical , perpendicular shocks in the presence of pickup ions .",
    "firstly , we separate the electric field into several terms ( such as hall term and lorentz term ) , and their importance is evaluated .",
    "secondly , we compare the contributions of pickup ions and solar wind ions to each term above .",
    "finally , we study the impact the percentage of pickup ions on the shock front nonstationarity . the analysis has evidenced the following features :    \\1 . in low pis% case ,",
    "the supercritical shock is nonstationary . for the electric field @xmath88 , after the new shock ramp is formed , the hall term becomes more and more important with the increase of the new ramp .",
    "after the new ramp exceeds the old ramp , its width is very small , which is comparable with or even smaller than the ion inertial length , and the hall term dominates the electric field @xmath88 . at that time , the electric field @xmath88 is obviously larger that at other times . as pointed previously by @xcite the shock surfing acceleration ( ssa ) , where the particles are reflected mainly due to the electric field @xmath88 , ion lorentz term become negligible at that time .",
    "the characteristics mentioned above is nearly the same as that obtained at the nonstationary perpendicular shock in the absence of pickup ions @xcite .",
    "\\2 . in low pis% case",
    ", the extended foot caused by the reflected pickup ions also has been retrieved .",
    "@xmath0 in the extended , stationary foot region ( so - called region i ) is mainly contributed by the lorentz term , which is always dominated by the pickup ions . in solar wind ion foot region",
    "( so - called region ii ) , contributions of the pickup ions and solar wind ions are competing with each other in the lorentz term of @xmath0 .",
    "simultaneously , the hall term is mainly contributed by the solar wind ions . and in the ramp and overshoot ( so - called region iii )",
    ", @xmath0 is mainly contributed by the hall term and is always dominated by the solar wind ions .",
    "\\3 . in high pis% case ,",
    "the amplitude of the extended foot is increased as expected .",
    "the striking point is that region ii can not be found any more .",
    "the whole shock front becomes stationary . because the amplitude of the overshoot and cross shock electric field",
    "is decreased and thus they are not strong enough to form the solar wind ion vortex in phase space at the ramp .    \\4 . in high pis% case ,",
    "there are two remainder regions ( i and iii ) within the shock front . @xmath0 in region",
    "i is dominated by the lorentz term contributed by the pickup ions and @xmath0 in region iii is dominated by the hall term contributed by the solar wind ions , respectively .",
    "recently , although the real ion - to - electron mass ratio has been employed . a few other plasma parameters are demonstrated to have great influence on the structure of the supercritical , quasi - perpendicular shock .",
    "if a high @xmath89 ratio is used , a buneman instability between reflected ions and the inflow electrons plays an important role in the foot electric field in electron inertial scale @xcite , and on this scale the electron pressure term may become as important as the lorentz term and hall term analyzed in this paper .",
    "simultaneously , two - dimensional pic simulations found that a supercritical quasi - perpendicular shock may be emitted waves , such as oblique whistler waves and lower - hybrid waves within the shock front @xcite , which may also change the structures of the shock .",
    "in addition , alfvn waves @xcite or upstream turbulence generated by summing many individual circularly polarized alfvn waves @xcite are always observed in the solar wind .",
    "clear ripples can be identified at the front of the shock after the interaction of upstream turbulence structures with a shock .",
    "how they will affect the cross shock electric field / potential and the mechanisms of ion acceleration at perpendicular shocks is our future topic .",
