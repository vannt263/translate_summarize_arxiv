    "this paper is concerned with sampling from the uniform distribution , @xmath6 , on the set of proper @xmath7-colourings of a finite - size rectangular grid .",
    "@xmath7-colouring _ of a graph is an assignment of a colour from a finite set of @xmath7 distinct colours to each vertex and we say that a colouring is a _ proper _ _ colouring _ if no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same colour .",
    "proper @xmath7-colourings of the grid correspond to the zero - temperature anti - ferromagnetic @xmath7-state potts model on the square lattice , a model of significant importance in statistical physics ( see for example salas and sokal  @xcite ) .",
    "sampling from @xmath6 is computationally challenging , however it remains an important task and it is frequently carried out in experimental work by physicists by simulating some suitable random dynamics that converges to @xmath6 . ensuring that a dynamics converges to @xmath6 is generally straight forward , but obtaining good upper bounds on the number of steps required for the dynamics to become sufficiently close to @xmath6 is a much more difficult problem .",
    "physicists are at times forced to `` guess '' ( using some heuristic methods ) the number of steps required for their dynamics to be sufficiently close to the uniform distribution in order to carry out their experiments . by establishing rigorous bounds on the convergence rates ( _ mixing time _ ) of these dynamics computer scientists can provide underpinnings for this type of experimental work and also allow a more structured approach to be taken .",
    "providing bounds on the mixing time of markov chains is a well - studied problem in theoretical computer science .",
    "however , the types of markov chains frequently considered by computer scientists do not always correspond to the dynamics usually used in the experimental work by physicists . in computer science , the mixing time of various types of _ random update markov chains _ have been frequently analysed ; notably on the grid by achlioptas , molloy , moore and van bussel  @xcite and goldberg , martin and paterson  @xcite .",
    "we say that a markov chain on the set of colourings is a random update markov chain when one step of the the process consists of randomly selecting a set of vertices ( often a single vertex ) and updating the colours assigned to those vertices according to some well - defined distribution induced by @xmath6 .",
    "experimental work is , however , often carried out by cycling through and updating the vertices ( or subsets of vertices ) in a deterministic order .",
    "this type of dynamics has recently been studied by computer scientists in the form of _ systematic scan markov chains _ ( _ systematic scan _ for short ) . for results regarding systematic scan",
    "see for instance dyer , goldberg and jerrum  @xcite and pedersen  @xcite although these papers are not considering the grid specifically .",
    "it is important to note that systematic scan remains a random process since the method used to update the colour assigned to the selected set of vertices is a randomised procedure drawing from some well - defined distribution induced by @xmath6 .    in section  [ sec : coupling ]",
    "we present a computer assisted proof that systematic scan mixes rapidly when considering @xmath0-colourings of the grid .",
    "previously eight was the least number of colours for which systematic scan on the grid was known to be rapidly mixing , due to pedersen  @xcite , a result which we hence improve on in this paper .",
    "we will make use of a recent result by pedersen  @xcite to prove rapid mixing of systematic scan by bounding the influence _ on _ a vertex ( note that the literature traditionally talks about sites rather than vertices ) .",
    "we will provide bounds on this influence parameter by using a heuristic to mechanically construct sufficiently good _ couplings _ of proper colourings of a 2@xmath12  sub - grid .",
    "we will hence use a heuristic based computation in order to establish a rigorous result about the mixing time of a systematic scan markov chain .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : partial - results ] , we consider the possibility of proving rapid mixing of systematic scan for @xmath5-colourings of the grid by increasing the size of the sub - grids .",
    "we give lower bounds on the appropriate influence parameter that imply that the proof technique we employ does not imply rapid mixing of systematic scan for @xmath5-colourings of the grid when using 2@xmath12 , 2@xmath13 and  3@xmath13 sub - grids .",
    "let @xmath8 be the set of colours and @xmath9 the set of vertices of a finite rectangular grid @xmath10 with toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "working on the torus is common practice as it avoids treating several technicalities regarding the vertices on the boundary of a finite grid as special cases and hence lets us present the proof in a more `` clean '' way .",
    "we point out however that these technicalities are straightforward to deal with ( more on this in section  [ sec : mixing ] ) .",
    "we formally say that a colouring @xmath11 of @xmath10 is a function from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the set of all colourings of @xmath10 and @xmath15 be the set of all proper @xmath7-colourings .",
    "then the distribution @xmath6 , described earlier , is the uniform distribution on @xmath15 . if @xmath16 is a colouring and @xmath17 is a vertex then @xmath18 denotes the colour assigned to vertex @xmath19 in colouring @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , for a subset of vertices @xmath20 and a colouring @xmath16 we let @xmath21 denote the colouring of the vertices in @xmath22 under @xmath11 . for each vertex @xmath17 , let @xmath23 denote the set of pairs @xmath24 of colourings that only differ on the colour assigned to vertex @xmath19 , that is @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be a markov chain with state space @xmath14 and stationary distribution @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that the transition matrix of @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "then the mixing time from an initial colouring @xmath16 is the number of steps , that is applications of @xmath28 , required for @xmath27 to become sufficiently close to @xmath6 .",
    "formally the mixing time of @xmath27 from an initial colouring @xmath16 is defined , as a function of the deviation @xmath29 from stationarity , by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total variation distance between two distributions @xmath32 and @xmath33 on @xmath14 .",
    "the mixing time @xmath34 of @xmath27 is then obtained my maximising over all possible initial colourings @xmath35 we say that @xmath27 is _ rapidly mixing _ if the mixing time of @xmath27 is polynomial in @xmath3 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will make use of a recent result by pedersen  @xcite to study the mixing time of a systematic scan markov chain for @xmath0-colourings of the grid using _ block updates_. we need the following notation in order to define our systematic scan markov chain .",
    "define the following set @xmath37 of @xmath38 blocks .",
    "each block @xmath39 is a 2@xmath12  sub - grid and @xmath38 is the smallest integer such that @xmath40 . for any block @xmath41 and a pair of colourings",

    "we also let @xmath46 denote the set of vertices in @xmath47 that are adjacent to some vertex in @xmath41 , and we will refer to @xmath46 as the _ boundary _ of @xmath41 .",
    "note from our previous definitions that @xmath48 denotes the colouring of the boundary of @xmath41 under a colouring @xmath16 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath48 as a _ boundary colouring_. finally we say that a @xmath0-colouring of the 2@xmath12  sub - grid @xmath41 _ agrees _ with a boundary colouring @xmath48 if ( 1 ) no adjacent sites in @xmath41 are assigned the same colour and ( 2 ) each vertex @xmath49 is assigned a colour that is different to the colours of all boundary vertices adjacent to @xmath19 .    for each block @xmath41 and colouring @xmath16",
    "let @xmath50 be the subset of @xmath14 such that if @xmath51 then @xmath52 off @xmath41 and @xmath53 agrees with @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the uniform distribution on @xmath50 .",
    "we then define @xmath55 to be the transition matrix on the state space @xmath14 for performing a so - called _ heat - bath _ move on @xmath41 . a heat - bath move on a block @xmath41 , given a colouring @xmath16 ,",
    "is performed by drawing a new colouring from the distribution @xmath54 .",
    "note in particular that applying @xmath55 to a colouring @xmath16 results in a colouring @xmath56 such that @xmath52 off @xmath41 and the colouring @xmath57 of @xmath41 is proper and agrees with the colouring @xmath58 of the boundary of @xmath41 ( which is identical to @xmath48 ) .",
    "we formally define the following systematic scan markov chain for @xmath0-colourings of @xmath10 , which systematically performs heat - bath moves on 2@xmath12 sub - grids , as follows .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this holds for _ any _ _ ordering _ of the set of blocks .",

    "it is customary to refer to one application of @xmath61 ( that is updating each block once ) as one _ scan_. one scan takes @xmath62 _ vertex updates _ and by construction of @xmath63 this sum is clearly of order @xmath64",

    "previously it was known that systematic scan for @xmath7-colourings on general graphs with maximum vertex degree @xmath66 mixes in @xmath2 scans when @xmath67 due to pedersen  @xcite .",
    "that result is a hand - proof and uses block updates that updates the colour at each endpoint of an edge during each step .",
    "earlier dyer et al .",
    "@xcite had shown that a single - site systematic scan markov chain ( where one vertex is updated at a time ) mixes in @xmath2 scans when @xmath68 and in @xmath69 scans when @xmath70 .",
    "it is hence well - established that systematic scan is rapidly mixing for @xmath7-colourings of the grid when @xmath71 but nothing has been known about the mixing time for smaller @xmath7 .",
    "the results of both pedersen  @xcite and dyer et al .",
    "@xcite bound the mixing time by studying the influence _ on _ a vertex .",
    "we will use that technique in this paper as well , however we will construct the required couplings using a heuristic .",
    "we defer the required definitions to section  [ sec : mixing ] which also contains the proof of theorem  [ thm : gridmix ] .",
    "recent results have revealed that , in a single - site setting , one is not restricted use the total influence on a vertex when analysing the mixing time of systematic scan by bounding influence parameters . in a single - site setting one can define an @xmath3@xmath1@xmath3-matrix whose entries are the influences that all vertices have on each other .",
    "hayes  @xcite has shown that providing a sufficiently small upper bound on the spectral gap of this matrix implies rapid mixing of both systematic scan and random update .",
    "dyer , goldberg and jerrum  @xcite furthermore showed that an upper bound on any matrix norm also implies rapid mixing of both types of markov chains .",
    "these techniques are however not known to apply to markov chains using block moves .",
    "see the phd thesis by pedersen  @xcite for more comprehensive review of the above results and for the difficulties in extending them to cover block dynamics .    as",
    "random update markov chains have received more attention than systematic scan we also summarise some mixing results of interest regarding @xmath7-colourings of the grid ( recall that a random update markov chain selects randomly a subset of sites to be updated at each step ) . achlioptas et al .  @xcite",
    "give a computer - assisted proof of mixing in @xmath72 updates when @xmath73 by considering blocks consisting of 2@xmath13  sub - grids .",
    "our computations are similar in nature to the ones of achlioptas et al .",
    "however their computations are not sufficient to imply mixing of systematic scan as we will discuss in due course .",
    "more recently goldberg , martin and paterson  @xcite gave a hand - proof of mixing in @xmath72 updates when @xmath74 using the technique of strong spatial mixing .",
    "previously salas and sokal  @xcite gave a computer - assisted proof of the @xmath75 case , a result which was also implied by another computer - assisted result due to bubley , dyer and greenhill  @xcite that applies to @xmath76-regular triangle - free graphs .",
    "finally it is worth pointing out that , in the special case when @xmath77 , two complementary results of luby , randall and sinclair  @xcite and goldberg , martin and paterson  @xcite give rapid mixing of random update .",
    "this section will contain a proof of theorem  [ thm : gridmix ] although the proof of a crucial lemma , which requires computer - assistance , is deferred to section  [ sec : coupling ] .",
    "we will bound the mixing time of @xmath59 by bounding the influence on a vertex , a parameter which we denote by @xmath78 and will define formally in due course . if @xmath78 is sufficiently small then theorem  2 from pedersen  @xcite implies that any systematic scan markov chain , whose transition matrices for updating each block satisfy two simple properties , mixes in @xmath2 scans . for completeness",
    "we restate this theorem ( theorem  [ thm : main - d ] below ) and in the statement we let @xmath79 denote a systematic scan markov chain whose transition matrices for each block update satisfy the required properties .",
    "[ thm : main - d ] if @xmath80 then the mixing time of @xmath79 is @xmath81    for each block @xmath41 the transition matrix @xmath55 needs to satisfy the following two properties in order for theorem  [ thm : main - d ] to apply .    1 .   if @xmath82 then @xmath43 off @xmath41 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath6 is invariant with respect to @xmath83    it is pointed out in pedersen @xcite that if @xmath55 is a transition matrix performing a heat - bath move then both of these properties are easily satisfied .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out that when @xmath15 is the set of proper colourings of a graph , then @xmath6 is the uniform distribution on @xmath15 as we require .",
    "since the transition matrices @xmath55 used in the definition of @xmath59 perform heat - bath updates we are hence able to use theorem  [ thm : main - d ] to bound the mixing time of @xmath59 .",
    "we are now ready to formally define the parameter @xmath78 denoting the influence on a vertex . for",
    "any pair of colourings @xmath84 let @xmath85 be a coupling of the distributions induced by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , namely @xmath54 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "we remind the reader that a coupling of two distributions @xmath89 and @xmath90 on state space @xmath14 is a joint distribution @xmath91 such that the marginal distributions are @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for ease of reference",
    "we also let @xmath92 denote the probability that a vertex @xmath49 is assigned a different colour in a pair of colourings drawn from some coupling @xmath85 .",
    "we then let @xmath93 be the influence of @xmath94 on @xmath19 under @xmath41 .",
    "finally the parameter @xmath78 denoting the influence on any vertex is defined as @xmath95    pedersen  @xcite actually defines @xmath78 with a weight associated with each vertex , however as we will not use weights in our proof we have omitted them from the above account .",
    "so , in order to upper bound @xmath78 we are required to upper bound the probability of a discrepancy at each vertex @xmath49 under a coupling @xmath85 of the distributions @xmath54 and @xmath88 for any pair of colourings @xmath84 that only differ at the colour of vertex @xmath94 .",
    "our main task is hence to specify a coupling @xmath85 of @xmath54 and @xmath88 for each pair of colourings @xmath84 and upper bound the probability of assigning a different colour to each vertex in a pair of colourings drawn from that coupling .",
    "consider any block @xmath41 and any pair of colourings @xmath84 that differ only on the colour assigned to some vertex @xmath94 .",
    "clearly the distribution on colourings of @xmath41 , induced by @xmath54 only depends on the boundary colouring @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the distribution on colourings of @xmath41 , induced by @xmath88 depends only on @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath97 then the distributions on the colourings of @xmath41 , induced by @xmath54 and @xmath88 , respectively , are the same and we let @xmath85 be the coupling in which any pair of colourings drawn from @xmath85 agree on @xmath41 .",
    "that is , if the pair @xmath98 of colourings are drawn from @xmath85 then @xmath52 off @xmath41 , @xmath99 off @xmath41 and @xmath100 on @xmath41 .",
    "this gives @xmath101 for any @xmath97 and @xmath49 .",
    "we now need to construct @xmath85 for the case when @xmath102 . for each @xmath49",
    "we need @xmath92 to be sufficiently small in order to avoid @xmath103 being too big",
    ". if the @xmath103-values are too big the parameter @xmath78 will be too big ( that is greater than one ) and we can not make use of theorem  [ thm : main - d ] to show rapid mixing .",
    "constructing @xmath85 by hand such that @xmath92 is sufficiently small is a difficult task .",
    "it is , however , straight forward to mechanically determine which colourings have positive measure in the distributions @xmath54 and @xmath88 for a given pair of boundary colourings @xmath48 and @xmath96 . from these distributions",
    "we can then use some suitable heuristic to construct a coupling that is good enough for our purposes .",
    "we hence need to construct a specific coupling for each individual pair of colourings differing only at a single vertex . in order to do this",
    "we will make use of the following lemma , which is proved in section  [ sec : coupling ] .",
    "[ lem : main - lemma]let @xmath104 be the four vertices in a 2@xmath12-block and @xmath105 be the boundary vertices of the block and let the labeling be as in figure  [ fig : labeling-2x2-block ] .",
    "let @xmath106 and @xmath107 be any two @xmath0-colourings of the boundary vertices such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 agree on each vertex except on @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 and @xmath110 be the uniform distributions on proper @xmath0-colourings of the block that agree with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively",
    ". for @xmath111 let @xmath112 denote the probability that the colour of vertex @xmath113 differ in a pair of colourings drawn from a coupling @xmath114 of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "then there exists a coupling @xmath114 such that @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "general labeling of the vertices in a 2@xmath12-block @xmath41 and the vertices @xmath46 on the boundary of the block . ]",
    "thus if @xmath102 we let @xmath85 be the coupling of @xmath54 and @xmath88 that draws the colouring of @xmath41 from the coupling @xmath114 in lemma  [ lem : main - lemma ] , where @xmath106 is the boundary colouring obtained from @xmath48 and @xmath107 is obtained from @xmath96 , and leaves the colour of the remaining vertices , @xmath119 , unchanged .",
    "that is , if the pair @xmath98 of colourings are drawn from @xmath85 then @xmath52 off @xmath41 , @xmath99 off @xmath41 and the colourings of @xmath41 in @xmath120 and @xmath121 are drawn from the coupling @xmath114 in lemma  [ lem : main - lemma ] ( see the proof for details on how to construct @xmath114 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this is indeed a coupling of @xmath54 and @xmath88 .",
    "note that due to the symmetry of the 2@xmath12-block , with respect to rotation and mirroring , we can always label the vertices of @xmath41 and @xmath46 such that label @xmath108 in figure  [ fig : labeling-2x2-block ] represents the discrepancy vertex @xmath94 on the boundary .",

    "course we have yet to establish a proof of lemma [ lem : main - lemma ] , and the rest of this paper will be concerned with this .",
    "our method of proof uses some ideas of goldberg , jalsenius , martin and paterson  @xcite in so far as it is computer assisted and we will be focusing on minimising the probability of assigning different colours to vertex @xmath136 in the constructed couplings .",
    "we will however be required to construct a coupling on the 2@xmath12 sub - grid , rather than establishing bounds on the disagreement probability of a vertex adjacent to the initial discrepancy and then extending this to a coupling on the whole block recursively .",
    "our approach is similar to the one achlioptas et al .",
    "@xcite take , however we do not have the option of constructing an `` optimal '' coupling using a suitable linear program ( even when feasible ) since our probabilities will be maximised over all boundary colourings .",
    "the crucial difference between the approaches is that achlioptas et al .",
    "@xcite are using path coupling ( see bubley and dyer  @xcite ) as a proof technique which requires them to bound the expected hamming distance between a pair of colourings drawn from a coupling .",
    "this in turn enables them to , for a given boundary colouring , specify an `` optimal '' coupling which minimises hamming distance .",
    "we are , however , required to bound the influence of @xmath94 on @xmath19 for each boundary colouring and sum over the maximum of these influences .",
    "the reason for this is the inherit maximisation over boundary colourings in the definition of @xmath103 as described above .",
    "finally it is worth mentioning that providing bounds on the expected hamming distance is similar to showing that the influence _ of _ a vertex is small and it is known that this condition implies rapid mixing of a random update markov chain , see for example weitz  @xcite . in a single - site setting the condition ``",
    "the influence _ of _ a vertex is small '' also implies rapid mixing of systematic scan ( dyer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , however , in a block setting this condition is not sufficient to give rapid mixing of systematic scan ( pedersen  @xcite ) , which is why we need to bound the influence _ on _ a vertex .",

    "<S> a systematic scan markov chain cycles through finite - size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order and updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset . the systematic scan markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2@xmath12 sub - grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure known as heat - bath . </S>",
    "<S> we give a computer - assisted proof that this systematic scan markov chain mixes in @xmath2 scans , where @xmath3 is the size of the rectangular sub - grid . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of colourings of 2@xmath12 sub - grids . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time the mixing time of a systematic scan markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than @xmath4 colours . </S>",
    "<S> we also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving rapid mixing of a systematic scan markov chain for sampling @xmath5-colourings of the grid by considering 2@xmath13 and 3@xmath13 sub - grids .    </S>",
