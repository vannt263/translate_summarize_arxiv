    "microscopic theory predicts for this model appearance of a localization transition @xcite where at a critical obstacle density the long - range transport ceases . in accordance , as the critical density of scatterers is approached the tracer particle experiences a sublinear in time increase of its mean - square displacement and the diffusion constant vanishes at a critical concentration of obstacles .",

    "the last one is either determined by the lattice percolation exponent @xmath70 or by the distribution of the resistances of the bottleneck ( narrow paths between the almost contacting obstacles ) @xcite . despite much more complicated geometry of our model , the bottlenecks in it appear close to the contact points of essentially circular areas , and",
    "therefore should show the same resistivity singularity behavior as the swiss cheese model @xcite which has the same conductivity exponent as the lattice percolation .",

    "fig.[fig : perppar_time],[fig : diffusion2 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of each of the components for the values of parameters corresponding to the percolating phase is also quite typical : the normal short - time diffusion with the seed diffusivity coefficient ( corresponding to practically non - constrained particle motion ) , a crossover to a more or less pronounced intermediate asymptotic subdiffusive behavior typical for percolation , and another crossover back to normal diffusion with the effective diffusion coefficient considerably smaller than the seed one ( cf .",
    "left panels of figs.7,8 ) . in the non - percolating domain",
    "the last crossover is the one to a saturating msd .",
    "however , fig.[fig : perppar_time ] also shows that the positions of the crossover regions and the widths of the crossover domains for the two components are quite different .",
    "for example , for @xmath100 the perpendicular component already underwent both crossovers at @xmath101 , while the parallel component has just entered the first crossover domain at the same time .",
    "summing up two functions with so strongly different behaviors to obtain the total diffusivity leads to the effective behavior which is seemingly far from typical percolation predictions .",
    "thus , in the figs.[fig : diffusion1 ] , [ fig : diffusion22 ] the exponents @xmath31 of single components of msd are either larger than or equal to ( within the error bars ) the percolation value of @xmath102 , as it has to be the case for the typical double crossover situation .",
    "the exponent characterizing the total displacement can however fall below the value of 0.55 , thus absolutely obscuring the percolative nature of the behavior observed .",
    "in this paper properties of diffusive motion of a tracer particle in crowded , anisotropic environment has been analyzed . in general ,",
    "transport slowdown with the characteristic effective exponent @xmath103 has been observed .",
    "however , details of the process depend in a complex way on three control parameters : concentration of obstacles , their orientational ( nematic - like ) ordering , as well as on the size of a tracer",
    ". moreover , due to environment anisotropy , the perpendicular and parallel motion to the intrinsic direction represented by the director orientation , cf . eq.([order ] ) has to be studied separately , as both components of the motion can exhibit a totally different behaviour .",
    "although our situation is definitely a variant of a continuous percolation model , it shows a very rich and interesting behavior due to its novel aspect , namely the anisotropy",
    ". the characteristic crossover times for the components of motion parallel and perpendicular to the main axes can be very different , so that the total diffusion coefficient can show effective time dependence which does not resemble the one for lattice percolation , and can even exhibit much slower effective subdiffusive behavior on intermediate times .",
    "analysis of the effective exponent @xmath31 averaged over the time window @xmath75 $ ] shows that subdiffusive transport of small tracers is observed in the whole range of the orientational order parameter and the expected crossover to percolation limit is detected for @xmath104 , see fig.9 . for high orientational order , closer inspection of time dependent @xmath44 allows to detect another crossover @xmath105 for very long times @xmath106 .",
    "yet , this `` almost normal '' diffusion remains strongly anisotropic , ( @xmath107 ) as demonstrated in the right panel of fig.9 and left panel of fig.12 .",
    "in general , positions of crossover regions and duration of the crossover domains are different for two orientational components of motion and can be rationalized in terms of transport on an anisotropic percolating space .",
    "we expect our findings to be relevant in understanding sources of anomalous transport in crowded , heterogeneous environments",
    ". active research in this field is beneficial for control of anomalous subdiffusion in biological media , calibration of measurements by use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) and analysis of single particle tracking within the dense environment of the cell @xcite .",
    "it is expected also to contribute to further progress in a general theory @xcite of the anisotropic motion of objects in entangled suspensions responsible for steric effects .",
