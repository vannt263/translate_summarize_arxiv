    "energy relaxation processes play an important role in the low temperature transport properties of diffusive metals , alloys and semiconductors .",
    "in particular , they determine the maximum electric field @xmath0 allowed if the system is to be measured under near - equilibrium conditions at a given temperature .",
    "the condition for that may be expressed as @xmath1 where the energy relaxation length @xmath2 is the length over which the electron diffuses under @xmath0 before the energy gained from it is dissipated into the thermal bath . in particular , this issue is relevant for all aspects of quantum transport such as corrections to the conductivity due to interference and electron - electron interactions . for a system of size @xmath3 ,",
    "energy relaxation processes are usually controlled by electron - phonon inelastic scattering , and in the following we shall assume that @xmath2 is dominated by the electron - phonon diffusion length @xmath4 .    in clean samples the electron - phonon scattering mechanism",
    "is well understood , and the scattering rate , @xmath5 , is known to be proportional to @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 denotes the temperature ) . in dirty systems however , where the elastic mean free path of the electron is smaller than the phonon thermal length , the situation is more complicated .",
    "schmid @xcite showed that in this case @xmath5 is suppressed and becomes proportional to @xmath8 , in accordance with pipard s ineffectiveness condition @xcite .",
    "his model assumed that the impurities are anchored to the lattice , and the scattering rate was calculated by moving into a reference frame which follows the lattice vibrations .",
    "riezer and sergeev obtained the same result using the laboratory frame of reference @xcite .",
    "a scattering rate proportional to @xmath8 has indeed been observed in a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "however , a @xmath6 law was frequently observed @xmath9 even in systems that were presumably well into the dirty limit regime @xcite . moreover ,",
    "quite a few observations of a @xmath10 scattering law were reported in other experiments @xcite .",
    "the latter experimental results triggered further studies with the aim of understanding better the electron - phonon scattering mechanism in disordered metals .",
    "in particular , to obtain an electron - phonon scattering rate proportional to @xmath10 ( rather than the `` ineffective '' @xmath8 law ) , belitz and wybourne @xcite assumed a strong phonon damping , while jan wu and wei @xcite included effects associated with the discrete lattice structure .",
    "sergeev and mitin @xcite obtained the @xmath10 behavior from a model were impurities are assumed to be fixed , namely , impurities which do not follow the lattice vibrations .",
    "they argued that heavy impurities or boundaries which move differently from the host lattice produce the same effect .",
    "in this paper we analyze the non - ohmic characteristic of thin films of in@xmath11o@xmath12:au ( crystalline indium - oxide doped with 2% gold ) , that were characterized and measured as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we show that in this system @xmath13 , and interpret this behavior as a manifestation of the sergeev mitin mechanism where the au atoms play the role of the immobile impurities .",
    "the sample resistance is used as a thermometer of the electron temperature .",
    "the latter is determined by the energy balance between the joule heating , due to the presence of electric field , and the heat transfer to the lattice phonons governed by @xmath14    the data we shall analyze are dynamic resistance @xmath15 versus voltage traces for a typical film at @xmath16 shown in fig .  1 ( left panel ) . as expected , the deviations from ohm s law become more pronounced as @xmath7 decreases . in the right panel of fig .  1 it is shown that these curves taken at different temperatures can be collapsed onto a common function : @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the scaling of the electric field as a power of the temperature , @xmath19 , and its relation to the electron - phonon time @xmath20 , has been already recognized by anderson , abrahams and ramakrishnan @xcite , and later by arai @xcite . in the next section",
    "we shall calculate the function @xmath21 , and clarify its relation to the electron - phonon relaxation time .",
    "we shall consider the dependence on the sample length and compare with further experimental results in section 3 .",
    "the essence of the picture developed below is the assignment of an effective temperature for a given field and bath - temperature .",
    "the electrons are accelerated by the electric field , and the collisions with other electrons and phonons result in a local equilibrium distribution characterized by an effective temperature @xmath22 . the latter differs from the bath temperature @xmath7 , and depends on the electric field .",
    "we shall make the association @xmath23 . hence knowing @xmath24 and the form of the near - equilibrium @xmath25 yields the desired @xmath26 from which we deduce the scaling function ( [ scaling - function ] ) .",
    "we begin by considering the boltzmann equation for the electron distribution function @xmath27 : @xmath28 . \\label{boltzmann}%\\ ] ] here @xmath29 is the position , @xmath30 is the velocity , @xmath31 denotes the momentum , @xmath32 the electric field , and @xmath33=i_{im}[f]+i_{ee}% [ f]+i_{ep}[f , n]$ ] represents the collision integrals due to impurity scattering , electron - electron , and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the latter depends also on the phonon distribution function , assumed to be the equilibrium distribution function denoted by @xmath34 .    following nagaev@xcite and kozub and rudin@xcite , we look for a steady state solution of the form:@xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes a unit vector in the direction of the momentum , and @xmath37 is the energy assumed to depend on the absolute value of the momentum @xmath38 . substituting ( [ f - form ] ) in ( [ boltzmann ] )",
    "leads to : @xmath39 .",

    ", the antisymmetric part of the distribution function can be expressed in terms of the symmetric part and substituted into ( [ boltzmann+ ] ) .",
    "the resulting equation is now averaged over the momentum directions to give @xmath50+i_{ep}[f^{+},n ] , \\label{diffuion - boltzmann}%\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the diffusion constant ( @xmath52 is the fermi velocity ) . here and henceforth we neglect the energy dependence of the diffusion constant .",
    "we wish to solve eq .",
    "( [ diffuion - boltzmann ] ) for homogeneous quasi - two dimensional samples of rectangular shape with voltage contacts located at @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath54 is independent of the transverse coordinate , and the boundary conditions assuming ideal contacts are : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath57 is the electron energy , @xmath58 is the fermi energy , @xmath59 is the voltage drop across the sample , @xmath60 is boltzmann constant , and @xmath7 is the bath temperature .      in understanding the form of the solution of equation  ( [ local - temp - eq ] ) , it is instructive to identify first the relevant length scale for this equation . to this end",
    "one may linearize the equation by substituting @xmath74 and expanding to linear order in @xmath75 .",
    "the solution of the resulting equation with the boundary conditions ( [ boundaryt ] ) is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is essentially the electron - phonon length at equilibrium . from ( [ linear - solution ] ) one can see that @xmath4 sets the distance from the contacts over which the temperature profile reaches a saturated value . thus long",
    "sample satisfies @xmath78 , and these may be considered to have an essentially space independent local temperature which we shall refer to as the effective temperature .    the linearized solution for long samples ( [ linear - solution ] ) is strictly justified when the electric field is weak , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "we shall be interested in the limit of strong fields where @xmath4 will presumably be smaller than its equilibrium value , the r.h.s of ( [ ep - length ] ) . provided",
    "@xmath80 it makes sense to assume an electron temperature , which is essentially constant throughout the sample .",
    "we then neglect the space dependent term in equation  ( [ local - temp - eq ] ) , and the effective temperature of the electrons , at any field strength , is readily deduced to be : @xmath81 ^{\\frac{1}{p+2}}.\\ ] ]    as mentioned earlier , once @xmath22 is known , to find the scaling function @xmath21 requires only the temperature dependence of the resistance , @xmath82 , since @xmath23 . at low temperatures , the temperature dependent terms of the resistance are the weak localization @xcite and the altshuler - aronov corrections @xcite . for thin films , both of these have a logarithmic behavior , thus @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a small dimensionless constant , depending on the nature of the electron - electron interactions , the spin - orbit coupling , and the ratio of the quantum unit resistance to the drude resistance of the sample , @xmath85 . substituting @xmath23 and ( [ equilibrium - resistance ] ) in the definition of the scaling function ( [ scaling - function ] ) , and expanding to the leading order in @xmath84",
    "we obtain : @xmath86   , \\label{r - scaling-1}%\\ ] ] note that this has the scaling form as in eq .",
    "( [ scaling - function ] ) above .    to anticipate the discussion in the next section , it is instructive to consider the case of short samples @xmath87 . here",
    "one may neglect the contribution of the electron - phonon collision term in eq .",
    "( [ local - temperature ] ) and readily obtain the solution for @xmath64 , whose space dependence , in general , can not be ignored : @xmath88 at the temperature range where the dephasing length is much smaller than the system size one may view the sample as a set of classical resistors connected in series . therefore the total resistance can be approximated by the sum : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the resistance of the j - th segment ( of size of the dephasing length ) , centered at the point @xmath91 .",
    "thus , assuming homogeneous sample , the experimentally measured resistivity is essentially an average over the position . from this",
    "average one immediately obtains the scaling function of short samples : @xmath92   , \\label{short - scaling}%\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath59 is the voltage drop along the sample .",
    "comparing the resistance curves shown in fig .  1 with eq .  ( [ r - scaling-1 ] ) ,",
    "one notes that a scaling form that leads to the data collapse occurs for @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the energy relaxation time is quadratic with temperature : @xmath94 , and therefore the electron - phonon length ( [ ep - length ] ) is inversely proportional to the temperature .",
    "o@xmath12:au sample with length l=80@xmath95 and width w=500@xmath95 ( full circles ) .",
    "the dashed lines are the logarithmic slopes used in defining the value of @xmath84 ( see eq .",
    "( [ equilibrium - resistance])).,width=302 ]    the procedure of extracting the detailed form of @xmath5 or @xmath4 from the experimental results is as follows .",
    "first , the value of @xmath96 is obtained by fitting the @xmath26 data of fig .  1 to eq .  ( [ r - scaling-1 ] ) , as shown in the right panel of this figure .",
    "note that the latter needs the parameter @xmath84 as input .",
    "this is defined by equation ( [ equilibrium - resistance ] ) above and is thus obtained from the near - equilibrium @xmath82 measurement performed on the same sample .",
    "such @xmath82 data and their associated @xmath84 are shown in fig .  2 for two samples .",
    "these are made from the same batch of a au - doped @xmath97 film , they only differ in their lateral dimensions .",
    "the first is the 3500@xmath98 m sample of fig .  1 . the second sample is @xmath99 long .",
    "the sheet resistances of the two are within 1% of each other , yet their logarithmic slopes are somewhat different . also , both samples show a systematic deviation from the theoretical @xmath100 dependence , a feature that seem to occur in some other 2d systems @xcite . since we are mainly interested in the restricted temperature range @xmath101 , this feature may be ignored , and @xmath84 is defined by fitting @xmath82 to a simple @xmath100 over the relevant range as shown in the figure . the fits yield @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the long and short samples respectively , and these values are used in the subsequent analysis below .",
    "an excellent fit to the data in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 can be obtained using eq .",
    "( [ r - scaling-1 ] ) with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath18 .",
    "the use of this formula , appropriate for the @xmath78 limit , is justified for this sample as can be seen by estimating @xmath4 .",
    "inserting the above value of @xmath96 in equation ( [ ep - length ] ) , gives @xmath106 @xmath107 at @xmath108 and only @xmath109 at @xmath110 .",
    "thus @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath62 down to the lowest temperature we are dealing with here .    for the 80@xmath95 sample , on the other hand , a crossover to the short - sample regime",
    "is realized in the temperature interval covered in our experiments .",
    "the crossover can be seen by studying the data depicted in figs . 3 , and 4 .",
    "3 shows the raw @xmath111 data measured at different temperatures .",
    "4 show these data plotted according to the short - sample formula ( eq .",
    "( [ short - scaling ] ) ) in the left panel , and according to the long - sample scheme ( eq .  ( [ r - scaling-1 ] ) with @xmath18 ) in the right panel .",
    "the crossover temperature is the temperature below which the @xmath26 data can be scaled as a function of @xmath112 , and above which it scales as @xmath113 . comparing between the left and the right panels of fig .",
    "4 it is evident that this temperature is approximately @xmath114 .",
    "thus , with this sample , the consistency of our approach can be tested in the two limits . as shown in the left panel of fig .  4 , a good fit to the @xmath115 data",
    "is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ short - scaling ] ) , which involves just the parameter @xmath84 .",
    "note that the best fit @xmath84 is quite close to the @xmath84 that one gets from the logarithmic fit to the @xmath82 data of this sample ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the other limit , which conforms to eq .",
    "( [ r - scaling-1 ] ) , also yields a reasonable agreement , with the _ same _ @xmath84 as used above , and with @xmath116 ( see right panel of fig .  4 ) .",
    "the quality of the fit here is less good than in the 3500@xmath95 sample , perhaps due to the fact that even at the highest temperature used the sample is not really in the long - sample limit .    finally , using the value of @xmath96 for this sample in eq .",
    "( [ ep - length ] ) , one gets @xmath106 @xmath117 at @xmath108 and@xmath118 at @xmath119 . since it is plausible to expect that the crossover from the short - sample to long - sample regime should occur when @xmath4 becomes comparable with @xmath120 , these numbers are consistent with our picture .",
    "we turn now to discuss the physics that underlies the @xmath121 law for the electron - phonon scattering rate suggested by our analysis .",
    "it is important to note that the enhanced electron - phonon inelastic scattering resulted from the inclusions of au atoms in the indium - oxide matrix : by comparison , an undoped in@xmath11o@xmath12 sample showed @xmath5 that , at @xmath122 was more than _ three orders of magnitude smaller _ @xcite . since these pure and the au - doped samples had otherwise quite similar parameters ( their @xmath123 and diffusion constant were the same to within 30% ) , the non - trivial role of the gold in enhancing @xmath124  must be considered .",
    "it seems likely that this is a manifestation of the sergeev - mitin mechanism for electron - phonon scattering in disordered metals .",
    "the gold impurities in our samples are heavier than the host atoms , and being inert they are also loosely attached to the indium - oxide lattice .",
    "these factors limit their ability to follow the lattice movement , and thus the main assumption of the sergeev - mitin mechanism is fulfilled . at the same time , the au atoms are active as local soft - modes which could be very effective in dephasing the electrons@xcite .",
    "however , being weakly coupled to the lattice , they can not efficiently dissipate the energy , gained by inelastic collisions with the electrons , to the bath .",
    "therefore the au inclusions contribute to dephasing much more than to energy relaxation .",
    "note indeed that the phase coherence length in these samples is dominated by the interaction of the electrons with these local modes@xcite and it is @xmath125 at @xmath126 as compared with @xmath127 @xmath128 . that the dephasing rate exceeds the energy relaxation rate by many orders of magnitude is quite a general property of low temperature transport , which follows from the different@xmath9temperature dependencies of energy relaxation",
    "processes on one hand and dephasing on the other hand .    to summarize ,",
    "we have employed a scaling analysis of non - ohmic resistance curves in order to extract the electron - phonon scattering rate of metallic films .",
    "the method makes use of the temperature dependence of the resistivity therefore it is best suited for those cases where the resistance can be used as a sensitive thermometer .",
    "our analysis , which assumes quasi - two dimensional samples may be easily extended to other dimensionalities . in these cases",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistance , at sufficiently low temperatures , is dominated by a power low behavior , @xmath129 .",
    "from here it follows that the scaling function ( [ scaling - function ] ) of long samples satisfies the relation : @xmath130   .\\ ] ] having the equilibrium parameters ( @xmath84 and @xmath131 ) , the experimental data of @xmath132 can be fitted to the above form and both @xmath96 and @xmath133 can be extracted .",
    "the electron phonon length is then deduced from eq .",
    "( [ ep - length ] ) .",
    "we reiterate that in order to apply the scaling approach , the following conditions should be satisfied : ( a ) the heat transfer from the electrons to the bath is dominated by the electron - phonon collisions ; ( b ) the electron - electron diffusion length should be much smaller than the energy relaxation length .    on the other hand ,",
    "the scaling approach is insensitive to the inclusion of other ingredients such as two level systems and kondo impurities as long as they do not serve as additional channels for heat conduction to the bath .",
    "furthermore , for long samples the quality of the contacts is of minor importance , since the amount of heat transferred by the electrons through the contacts is anyhow negligible . for short samples , however , our analysis assumes that the electrons near the contacts are at the bath temperature .",
    "this means that the contacts are ideal heat sinks , a caveat that should be borne in mind when using contacts made of a superconducting material ."
