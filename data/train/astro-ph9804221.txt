    "redshift evolution of fundamental physical relations in elliptical galaxies is generally considered to give strong constraints on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "for example , evolution of the color - magnitude ( @xmath0 ) relation with redshift ( @xmath7 ) suggests that elliptical galaxies are old , coeval , and homogeneous systems passively evolving after the single initial burst of star formation associated with dissipative galaxy formation at @xmath12 ( aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; ellis et al . 1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "this classical picture of coeval elliptical galaxy formation also appears to be supported by small redshift evolution of both the mass - to - light - ratio ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) and the @xmath13 relation ( ziegler & bender 1997 ) . the considerably tight @xmath0 relation ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) and the fundamental plane ( e.g. , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) at the present epoch , and redshift evolution of the slope and the zero - point of the @xmath0 relation ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ; gladders et al .",
    "1998 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) furthermore seem to support the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "an increasing number of recent observational results , however , shed a strong doubt on this long - standing view of elliptical galaxy formation , and suggest that there is great variety of star formation history among elliptical galaxies , such as the epoch of major star formation , the duration and efficiency of star formation ( worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ; faber et al .",
    "1995 ; worthey , trager , & faber 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , faber et al . (",
    "1995 ) suggested that the ` apparent age spread ' , which is inferred from the combination of line index analysis of elliptical galaxies , amounts to @xmath6 10 gyr .",
    "schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) found that in merger remnants with morphologically fine structures , the last merging epoch , which corresponds to elliptical galaxies formation , ranges from 4.6 gyr to 8.0 gyr ago .",
    "these observed spread in ` apparent mean age ' seem to be inconsistent with the aforementioned coevality of elliptical galaxy formation expected mainly from the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a plausible answer to the above apparent inconsistency in the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "we adopt the merger scenario of elliptical galaxy formation ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ) and thereby investigate to what degree the difference in the epoch of major galaxy merging ( i.e. , the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation ) can be allowed to preserve the observed small scatter of the @xmath0 relation of cluster ellipticals ( @xmath14 mag ) at @xmath7 = 0 ( bower et al .",
    "1992 ) , 0.55 ( ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) , and 0.895 ( stanford et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we find that owing to the age - metallicity conspiracy proposed by worthey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the observed small scatter in the @xmath0 relation can be reproduced reasonably well even in star - forming galaxy mergers with the widely spread merging epoch .",
    "this result accordingly reinforces the recent results of kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) , in which the tight @xmath0 relation can be successfully reproduced by merger scenario of elliptical galaxy formation based on a hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "this result furthermore implies that the previously suggested interpretation of the tightness of the @xmath0 relation at low and intermediate redshift ( @xmath11 ) is _ not unique _",
    ", thus that the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies can be more widely spread than the classical passive evolution picture predicts . thus , the above apparent inconsistency in the interpretation of the @xmath0 relation can be due primarily to the fact that previous studies claiming the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation did not explore so extensively possible variety in star formation history of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we adopt a one - zone chemophotometric evolution model of elliptical galaxies formed by major disk - disk galaxy mergers with the merging epoch widely spread , and thereby investigate to what degree the difference of the merging epoch can be allowed for keeping the observed tightness of the @xmath0 relation in cluster ellipticals at a given redshift .",
    "the remarkable differences in model assumptions between the present merger model and previous ones based on a classical initial burst picture of elliptical galaxy formation ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1992 ; kodama & arimoto 1996 ) are the following two .",
    "the first is that the present model allows _ continuous _ and _ moderate _ star formation of galaxies before the onset of the secondary starburst associated with the elliptical galaxy formation via merger events .",
    "the second is that in the present model , the epoch of the formation of elliptical galaxies ( more accurately , the formation of elliptical morphology ) is assumed to be the epoch of the secondary starbursts in mergers .",
    "these two differences generate qualitatively different results in the evolution of the @xmath0 relation between the present study and the previous ones based on a classical initial burst picture of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "the elliptical galaxy formation with the secondary starburst has been investigated by kauffmann ( 1996 ) in the context of the galaxy formation in the cold dark matter universe and by charlot & silk ( 1994 ) in the context of the origin of butcher - oemler galaxies .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of galaxies by using the model described in matteucci & tornamb ( 1987 ) which includes metal - enrichment processes of type ia and ii supernovae ( snia and snii ) .",
    "we adopt the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath15 , with upper mass limit @xmath16 and lower mass limit @xmath17 for most of the models .",
    "we also investigate the models with the slope of imf , @xmath18 , equal to 1.10 in order to confirm that the results derived for models with the salpeter imf can be generalized .",
    "the fraction of close binary stars ( represented by @xmath19 parameter in matteucci & tornamb 1987 ) , which controls the frequency of snia relative to snii , is assumed to be 0.1 . to calculate the ejected mass of gas and heavy elements , we use stellar yields derived by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for snii , nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi ( 1984 ) for snia , and bressan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and magris & bruzual ( 1993 ) for low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "we calculate photometric properties of galaxies as follows .",
    "the monochromatic flux of a galaxy with age @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is described as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a monochromatic flux of single stellar population ( ssp ) of age @xmath24 and metallicity @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is time - dependent star formation rate described later . in this paper , we use the spectral library gissel96 which is the latest version of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the star formation history of galaxy mergers is characterized by three epochs .",
    "the first is @xmath27 in redshift at which merger progenitor disk galaxies form and begin to consume initial interstellar gas by star formation with the moderate rate and the value of @xmath27 is fixed at 5.0 for all models .",
    "the second is @xmath8 at which two disks merge with each other and morphological transformation of galaxies ( to ellipticals ) and the accompanying starburst happen .",
    "the third is @xmath28 at which star formation ceases and it is defined as the epoch at which stellar mass fraction becomes 0.9 in our models .",
    "star formation rates of galaxy mergers during @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are described below . throughout the evolution of galaxy mergers ,",
    "the star formation rate is assumed to be proportional to gas mass fraction ( @xmath32 ) of galaxies ; @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a parameter which controls the star formation rate .",
    "this parameter @xmath34 is given as follows : @xmath35 the parameter values of @xmath36 investigated in the present study are 0.325 in units of gyr@xmath37 , which corresponds to an admittedly plausible star formation rate for sa disks ( e.g. , arimoto , yoshii , & takahara 1992 ) , 0.225 ( sb ) , and 0.056 ( sc ) .",
    "these values of @xmath36 are consistent with the time scale of star formation estimated from observations of disk galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .",
    "@xmath38 is fixed at 10.0 , which is about two - order of magnitude larger than that typical values of @xmath36 adopted in the present study .",
    "the strength of the starburst @xmath38 in the present model is consistent with observational results on starburst in gas - rich galaxy mergers ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1988 ) .    by using the above chemophotometric model",
    ", we investigate the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath5 color in galaxy mergers with @xmath8 = 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 0.9 , 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.5 , 1.6 , 2.0 and 3.0 for each sa , sb , and sc model and @xmath39 for sb and sc model .",
    "the reason why we do not investigate the merger with @xmath39 for sa model is that the fractional mass of stars in the sa disk is larger than 0.9 at @xmath40 ( see the dotted line in figure 1 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also investigate chemophotometric evolution of an isolated disk for sa , sb , and sc models . in the followings ,",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are set to be 65 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 and 0.05 respectively , which means that the corresponding present age of the universe is 13.8 gyr .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of the fractional mass of stars for 10 models with @xmath43 in the sa model .",
    "as is shown in figure 1 , star formation proceeds with moderate rate before galaxy merging and then rapidly after the onset of the secondary starbursts of galaxy merging .",
    "this continuous star formation before elliptical galaxy formation ( before galaxy merging ) just characterizes the star formation history of the present model .",
    "figure 2 describes the time evolution of the rest - frame @xmath5 color for the 10 models ( hereafter the @xmath5 color means the rest - frame @xmath5 color ) . from this figure",
    ", we can derive the following two qualitative results .",
    "firstly , the @xmath5 color becomes red within @xmath6 2 gyr after the secondary starburst of galaxy mergers for each model .",
    "the @xmath5 color difference among these models is only @xmath6 0.04 mag .",
    "secondly , the epoch at which the @xmath5 color becomes red depends on @xmath8 in such a way that the epoch is earlier for models with larger @xmath8 .",
    "these two qualitative results are found to be true for sb and sc models .",
    "accordingly , it is clear that for a given star formation history of merger progenitor galaxies ( for sa , sb , and sc models ) , @xmath8 is required to be within a certain range for the observed tightness of the @xmath0 relation at a given redshift .",
    "we mention that the derived @xmath5 color in our merger models is bluer than that of cluster ellipticals in bower et al .",
    "( 1992 ) owing to the smaller metallicity .",
    "the mass - weighted ( luminosity - weighted ) mean stellar metallicity of our models is about a half ( one - third ) of solar metallicity , although about a solar metallicity is needed to reproduce the observed color .",
    "this is essentially because we adopt the salpeter imf with @xmath44 and the one - zone chemical evolution .",
    "if we adopt shallower slope of imf ( e.g. , @xmath45 ) or larger values of @xmath46 ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) and _ nevertheless _ use the gissel ssp ( it is not reasonable to use the gissel ssp , since we here do not assume the imf adopted in gissel96 ) , we can reproduce redder color typical for cluster ellipticals in bower et al .",
    "however , since main purpose of the present study is not to successfully reproduce the absolute magnitude of global colors typical for cluster ellipticals but to explore the origin of the tight @xmath0 relation , it is not unreasonable to discuss the origin of the tight @xmath0 relation by using the merger models with rather bluer colors . in the last paragraph of this section",
    ", we will show the @xmath5 color evolution of models with shallower imf ( @xmath45 ) and confirm that the tight @xmath0 relation is achieved independent of the adopted imf .",
    "figure 3 shows the time evolution of the @xmath5 color for model with @xmath8 = 3.0 , 1.6 , 1.3 , 0.9 , 0.3 and 0.1 . here",
    ", we introduce the _ minimum _ @xmath8 required to keep the small scatter of the @xmath0 relation at a given redshift ( @xmath7=0.0 , 0.55 , and 0.895 ) for sa , sb , and sc models .",
    "if the @xmath8 of galaxy mergers is larger than the _ minimum _ value , the color scatter of galaxy mergers at a given redshift can be smaller than the observed one .",
    "the _ minimum _ @xmath8 is , for example , 1.3 ( 1.3 , 1.6 ) at @xmath7=0.895 , 0.9 ( 0.9 , 1.1 ) at @xmath7=0.55 , and 0.3 ( 0.1 , 0.3 ) at @xmath7=0.0 , in sa ( sb , sc ) models .",
    "figure 3 accordingly means , for example , that for sa models with @xmath9 , the dispersion of the @xmath5 color is well within the observed one in cluster ellipticals at @xmath7 = 0.895 ( @xmath6 0.05 mag ) .",
    "this figure furthermore shows that for keeping the tightness of the @xmath0 relation at higher redshift , @xmath8 should be larger .",
    "the gas mass fraction that has already been converted into stars at @xmath48 are 0.26 for sa model .",
    "this result suggests that a substantial fraction of initial gas has not necessarily been converted into stars already in higher redshift , which is conventionally required in the passive evolution picture .",
    "as is shown in figure 3 , these results are true for sb and sc models , although the range of the required @xmath8 depends on star formation histories of sa , sb and sc models in such a way that the required @xmath8 is appreciably larger for sc models .",
    "for example , the _ minimum _ @xmath8 is 1.6 at @xmath49 in sc models although it is 1.3 in both sa and sb models .",
    "thus , the scatter of the @xmath5 color in galaxy mergers with a wide spread in merging epoch is found to be rather small , which suggests that the tight @xmath0 relation at low and intermediate redshift does not necessarily require the coevality of elliptical galaxy or their formation at high redshift .    in order to clarify the reason for the small @xmath5 color scatter derived in galaxy mergers with the widely spread merging epoch , we investigate @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram for sa models with @xmath8 = 3.0 , 1.3 , 0.9 and 0.3 , for sb models with @xmath8 = 3.0 , 1.3 , 0.9 and 0.1 , and for sc models with @xmath8 = 3.0 , 1.6 , 1.3 and 0.3 . by using the @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] relations of the gissel ssp with various age and metallicity",
    ", we can observe the stellar populations characterizing the photometric properties of galaxy mergers ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    "1995 ) . because of the smaller metallicity , the values of @xmath51 $ ] in our models is smaller than observed values ( e.g. , faber et al . 1995 ; kuntschner & davies 1997 ) .",
    "we note again that this discrepancy might be removed by adopting the imf with larger stellar yield or relaxing the one - zone chemical evolution .",
    "as is shown in each panel of figure 4 , the characteristic metallicity of the galaxy merger with younger characteristic age ( with lower @xmath8 ) , is larger than that with older characteristic age ( with higher @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is because in the later starburst of galaxy mergers , younger stellar populations are formed preferentially from more metal - enriched interstellar gas .",
    "worthey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have already pointed out that if younger stellar population are more metal - enriched ( with the worthey s law of @xmath52 ) , the @xmath0 relation can be kept tight .",
    "accordingly , the small scatter in the present merger model is closely associated with the worthey s ` age - metallicity conspiracy ' . to clarify the effect of metallicity on the small scatter of the @xmath5 color",
    ", we calculate the time evolution of the @xmath5 color for the `` single metallicity '' models with @xmath43 in the sa model . here",
    "the `` single metallicity '' model means a model in which chemical evolution is _ not _ solved but the star formation history is exactly the same as those of a model solving chemical evolution fully . in this model ,",
    "all stellar populations with different ages in a galaxy have the same metallicity . in this calculation",
    ", we set @xmath25 to be 0.006 which is a typical value in our models .",
    "as is shown in figure  5 , the scatter of the @xmath5 color in the `` single metallicity '' model is appreciably larger than that in the sa models described before in figure 2 .",
    "we also note that the scatter becomes small more slowly in the `` single metallicity '' model than models including chemical evolution .",
    "this comparative experiment accordingly confirms that ` age - metallicity conspiracy ' plays a vital role in keeping the @xmath0 relation tight ( compare figure 2 and figure 5 ) .",
    "this result furthermore provides a qualitative explanation for the reason why the present study allows the spread in the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies ( more accurately , the epoch of the secondary starburst ) whereas the previous observational ones ( bower et al .",
    "1992 ; aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ) do not .",
    "this is principally because in the previous studies , neither variety of star formation in elliptical galaxies nor the effects of chemical enrichment on spectroscopic evolution of galaxies are so fully investigated .",
    "thus , it is demonstrated that owing to the age - metallicity conspiracy , the scatter of the @xmath0 relation observed in cluster ellipticals at low and intermediate redshift can be kept small , even if elliptical galaxies are formed by disk - disk galaxy mergers with the widely spread merging epoch .",
    "figure  4 furthermore shows an interesting behavior in redshift evolution of line index on @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram . as is shown in figure  4 for sa model , apparent age spread on @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram is smaller than the age spread of merging epoch ( the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation ) and becomes smaller as the age of burst populations becomes larger .",
    "for example , although the time spread between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is 7.6 gyr , the apparent age spread in the diagnostic diagram is less than 2 gyr at @xmath55 .",
    "this result suggests that even if the epoch of major galaxy merging is rather spread , the age spread inferred from the @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram can be considerably smaller at lower @xmath7 .",
    "this result thus implies that we can not necessarily confirm the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation even by using the @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram _ at lower redshift_. the result in figure  4 moreover provides an implication on the recent observational results concerning the @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram for cluster ellipticals at low redshift ( worthey et al . 1996 ; kuntschner & davies 1997 ; mehlert et al .",

    "mehlert et al .",

    "can give the following explanation for the apparent difference in age distribution of galaxies between the above studies . the smaller age scatter inferred from @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram for cluster of galaxies in kuntschner & davies ( 1997 ) and mehlert et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reflects the fact that _",
    "mean _ epoch of the last starburst associated with galaxy merging is relatively earlier whereas the larger scatter in worthey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reflects the fact that the epoch of the last starburst in elliptical galaxies is more widely spread owing to the larger spread in the epoch of galaxy merging .",
    "future observational studies will assess the validity of this interpretation about the diversity in the properties of @xmath50 } - \\log { \\rm h{\\small \\beta}}$ ] diagram for elliptical galaxies .",
    "lastly we present the results of models with the slope of imf ( @xmath18 ) equal to 1.10 in order to confirm that the above numerical results for models with smaller stellar yield can be applied to models with larger stellar yield which can reproduce the observed color of elliptical galaxies with larger metallicity . in this calculation",
    ", we also use the gissel96 , although the imf of these models is different from that adopted in gissel96 .",
    "figure  6 clearly demonstrates that even for models with larger stellar yield , the diversity in the epoch of galaxy merging does not introduce large scatter in the @xmath5 color , which implies that the aforementioned age - metallicity conspiracy does not depend on the stellar yield ( as a result , stellar metallicity ) of galaxies .",
    "assuming that there is a certain relation between the galactic luminosity and the mean stellar metallicity , this result implies that tightness of global color in a _ given _ luminosity in the @xmath0 relation can be kept in elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging .",
    "this accordingly implies that even the slope of the @xmath0 relation can be kept after the number increase of elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "merger progenitor disk galaxies are observationally revealed to have mass - metallicity relation ( zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) and color - magnitude relation similar to that of elliptical galaxies ( peletier & de grijs 1997 ) .",

    "the present study predicts that even if the epoch of major galaxy merging ( i.e. , the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation ) is rather spread , both the tightness and the slope of the @xmath0 relation can be kept owing to the age - metallicity conspiracy originally proposed by worthey et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "this result accordingly provides a heuristic explanation for the result of kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) in which the tight @xmath0 relation has been already reproduced in the merger scenario of elliptical galaxy formation based on the hierarchical clustering model .",
    "the conclusions derived in the present study however _ seem _ to be inconsistent with those derived in previous ones on the redshift evolution of the slope , zero - point and tightness of the @xmath0 relation of elliptical galaxies ( bower et al .",
    "1992 ; aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) ( see also gladders et al .",
    "1998 ) , which claim that the considerably less significant evolution of the slope of the @xmath0 relation rejects the age spread larger than 1 gyr among elliptical galaxies .",
    "the apparent disagreement between the present study and the previous ones ( e.g. , kodama & arimoto 1997 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) is due essentially to the fact that the previous studies inevitably have over - interpreted the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 relation owing to the ad hoc assumption adopted in the previous studies .",
    "although the previous studies are considerably sensible and valuable , it is important to point out the ad hoc assumptions adopted in the previous studies and thereby clarify the reason why the present conclusions are not consistent with those derived by the previous studies of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) and kodama et al . ( 1998 ) . the following three are the ad hoc assumptions which inevitably lead the previous studies to draw the strong and general conclusion that formation of elliptical galaxies ( especially in the cores of clusters ) are _ as a whole _",
    "coeval and occurred at high redshift .",
    "first is that elliptical galaxies are formed by _ only one _ initial starburst .",
    "owing to this assumption , time evolution of global colors of elliptical galaxies depends exclusively on the epoch of initial burst of star formation ( i.e. , the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation in the previous study ) . as a result of this , the age difference between elliptical galaxies ( i.e.",
    ", the difference of the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation in the previous studies ) can be more clearly reflected on the redshift evolution of the slope of the @xmath0 relation in the previous studies . accordingly",
    "the observed less significant evolution of the slope of the @xmath0 relation is more likely to be interpreted as an evidence that supports the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "it is certainly reasonable to claim that the observed evolution of the @xmath0 relation reject the ` pure age ' sequence model which demands that less luminous ellipticals have younger age .",
    "however , it seems not to be so reasonable to draw strong and general conclusion that elliptical galaxies are formed at @xmath58 _ only _ from the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "considering the first ad hoc assumption in the previous studies , what is more accurate and plausible interpretation on the observed evolution of the @xmath0 relation is just that the formation of _ stellar populations _ in _ some _ elliptical galaxies in the cores of _ some _ clusters ( not the formation of galaxies with structural and morphological properties similar to those of ellipticals ) can be coeval and occurred at higher redshift ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the second is that an elliptical galaxy in a cluster of galaxies at higher redshift is a precursor of an elliptical galaxy in a cluster at lower redshift .",
    "the third is that a cluster of galaxies observed at higher redshift is a precursor of a cluster of galaxies at lower one .",
    "these two ad hoc assumptions actually enable us to discuss the origin of elliptical galaxies in a more general way and thus lead us to draw more general conclusions on the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , since there are no observational evidences which can provide the firm physical basis for the above assumptions at least now , it is questionable to give any general conclusions on the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "thus , these three assumptions adopted in the previous studies inevitably lead them to provide the strong and general conclusion that formation of elliptical galaxies are coeval and occurred at higher redshift . the present study , on the other hand , does not adopt the above three ad hoc assumptions , and rather relaxes these assumptions .",
    "furthermore the present study instead allows both continuous and moderate star formation ( not strong initial starburst ) and the secondary starburst associated with galaxy merging , and assumes that the epoch of morphological transformation ( into ellipticals ) does not necessarily coincide with the epoch of galaxy formation ( i.e. , the epoch when the star formation begins ) .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath0 relation in the present study consequently does not depend so strongly on the difference in the formation epoch between elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , the epoch of major galaxy merging with the secondary starburst ) . as a result of this ,",
    "the present merger model predicts that even if the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , the epoch of galaxy merging ) are rather spread , both the slope and tightness of the @xmath0 relation can be kept .",
    "thus , the essential reason for the aforementioned apparent disagreement on the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation is that the present study does not adopt the above three ad hoc assumptions whereas the previous studies do .",
    "the interpretation on the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 relation in each model can depend strongly on the assumptions adopted by each model .",
    "it is safe for us to say that it is not clear , at least now , which of the two different conclusions on the coevality of elliptical galaxy formation is more plausible and reasonable .",
    "however , considering the above three ad hoc assumptions adopted in the previous studies , what is more reasonable interpretation on the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 slope is that only _ stellar populations _ ( not elliptical morphology ) in _ some _ ellipticals located in the cores of _ some _ clusters of galaxies are formed at higher redshift .",
    "we should not draw any _ general _ conclusions from the redshift evolution of the slope of the @xmath0 relation",
    ".    environmental difference of stellar populations ( in particular , the existence of intermediate - age population ) in early - type galaxies has been already indicated by a number of observational studies ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1990 ; rose et al .",
    "1994 ; mobasher & james 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the tightness and the slope of the @xmath0 relation of early - type galaxies are observationally revealed not to depend so strongly on galaxy environments .",
    "these two apparently inconsistent observational results on spectrophotometric properties of elliptical galaxies have called into the following question : `` why does not the @xmath0 relation of early - type galaxies depend strongly on galaxy environments ( e.g. , between rich clusters and poor ones ) , though stellar populations and star formation histories in early - type galaxies probably depend on galaxy environments ? '' to give a plausible answer for this question seems to be important because the above apparently inconsistent observational results give us valuable information both on the environmental difference in the details of physical processes of elliptical galaxy formation and on a certain mechanism for the tight @xmath0 relation . however , no extensive theoretical studies have yet addressed the above important question .",
    "the present study has shown that the age - metallicity conspiracy , which is achieved by younger and more metal - enriched stellar populations created in the secondary starburst of galaxy mergers , allows both the apparent age spread of elliptical galaxies and the tightness of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "this result seems to provide a clue to the above question . since the _ real _ question concerning the tight @xmath0 relation is not to determine the typical epoch of elliptical galaxy formation but to give a convincing explanation for the reason why possible diversity in star formation histories of elliptical galaxies can allow the tight @xmath0 relation , more extensive theoretical studies including more variety of star formation history of elliptical galaxies and its likely dependence on galaxy environments are certainly worth for our deeper understanding of the origin of the tight @xmath0 relation .",
    "the present numerical results are consistent with recent observational results which suggest that coeval elliptical galaxy formation with initial starburst at higher redshift ( @xmath60 ) is not promising .",
    "kauffmann , charlot , & white ( 1996 ) revealed that only about one - third of bright e / s0 galaxies in the sample of canada - france redshift survey were already in the passive evolution phase at @xmath61 .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a remarkable absence of early - type galaxies at @xmath62 in the @xmath63-band selected sample of early - type galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) , which suggests either that early - type galaxies are formed by galaxy merging with less prominent star formation or that a dust - polluted interstellar gas obscures forming elliptical galaxies till @xmath64 .",
    "zepf ( 1997 ) demonstrated that strong deficit of galaxies with extremely red colors in the hdf means that the formation epoch of typical elliptical galaxies is @xmath65 .",
    "sample galaxies in these studies are selected from _ field ellipticals _ , which possibly have star formation histories different from those of _",
    "cluster ellipticals_. accordingly , it might not be plausible to derive strong conclusions on the formation epoch of ellipticals .",
    "however these observational results together with the present results seem to support the merger scenario which can naturally predict that the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation is rather extended ranging from high redshift to moderate one .",
    "thus we have succeeded in pointing out that even if the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation ( i.e. , the epoch of major disk - disk galaxy merging , in this study ) is rather widely spread , the tightness of the @xmath0 relation at low and intermediate redshift can be kept reasonably well .",
    "this result suggests that coevality of elliptical galaxy formation , which has been conventionally believed in the classical passive evolution picture , is _ not unique _",
    "interpretation for the small scatter of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "this furthermore implies that _ only _ the tightness of the @xmath0 relation at a given redshift _ does not necessarily _ give strong constraints on the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies .",
    "worthey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have already pointed out that the age - metallicity conspiracy can keep both the tightness of the fundamental plane and that of the @xmath0 relation in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the present numerical study , which is different from the worthey s single stellar population analysis , has confirmed that the proposed age - metallicity conspiracy can actually operate to keep convincingly the tightness of the @xmath0 relation of ellipticals formed by disk - disk galaxy mergers .",
    "the present chemophotometric evolution model is , however , not so elaborated and realistic in that this model neither includes continuous gas accretion / merging expected from a specific cosmology ( e.g. , baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) nor considers important dynamical effects of galaxy merging on chemical and photometric evolution of galaxies ( bekki & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "accordingly it is our future study to confirm that the results derived in the present preliminary study can hold even for more sophisticated and realistic merger models .",
    "furthermore , we should check whether or not observed redshift evolution of other fundamental relations such as the @xmath66 relation ( ziegler & bender 1997 ) , the fundamental plane ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) , and the abundance ratio of [ mg / fe ] can be also reproduced self - consistently by our future merger model ."
