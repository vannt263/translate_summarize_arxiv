    "the investigation of nonhermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians is motivated by the fact that they possess eigenvalues which are either real or occur in complex - conjugate pairs @xcite .",
    "considerable attention has been paid to the delineation of systems with a completely real spectrum , with many works focussing on exactly solvable one - dimensional situations ( for reviews see @xcite ) . with the recent advent of optical implementations @xcite it has been realized that the appearance of complex eigenvalues drives a number of interesting switching effects @xcite , including the possible onset of lasing @xcite , which moves the most unstable states ( with energies or frequencies that have a large positive imaginary part ) into the centre of attention . at the same time , these implementations motivate the study of multi - dimensional systems in which many modes become mixed by multiple scattering . here , we investigate the formation and distribution of the complex spectrum in such situations on the basis of a statistical approach rooted in random - matrix theory @xcite , which samples systems that respect a certain set of symmetries and share a number of well - defined characteristic energy and time scales , but differ in the microscopic details of the dynamics .",
    "we extend earlier exploratory works of this approach @xcite to consider random - matrix ensembles which differ by the assumed absence or presence of elastic or dissipative magneto - optical effects .",
    "this leads to a choice between two generalized time - reversal symmetries , termed @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetry and physically motivated in @xcite .",
    "these ensembles apply to a coupled - resonator geometry ( with an absorbing resonator possessing @xmath2 internal modes coupled to a matching amplifying resonator via an interface of @xmath3 channels with transparency @xmath4 , and amplification or absorption rate set to a common value @xmath5 ) .",
    "the optical setting motivates to consider 5 particular scenarios ( oo , uo , uo@xmath6 , oa and oa@xmath6 ) .",
    "these can be studied either based on an effective hamiltonian or in terms on an effective time - evolution operator ( a quantum map ) , as is described in section [ sec : ensembles ] .    in section [ sec : largem ] we determine for each scenario the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane in the short - wavelength limit @xmath7 at fixed @xmath8 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we find that in this limit , the fraction of real eigenvalues among all eigenvalues vanishes at any finite fixed amplification and absorption rate , with the details of the eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane depending on the symmetry class . this supports the conclusion of earlier work on some of these ensembles @xcite that the transition to the complex spectrum occurs at a characteristic absorption rate @xmath9 which is classically small when compared to the inverse dwell time @xmath10 in each part of the resonator , but large when compared to the mean level spacing @xmath11 .    in order to investigate the details of this transition we then present results of extensive numerical investigations ( section [ sec : transition ] and [ sec : spacings ] ) .",
    "these reveal that the various ensembles display a different dependence of the transition on the coupling strength @xmath4 , as well as on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this division is associated with specific mechanisms of eigenvalue coalescence , which we relate to differences in the level spacing statistics in the hermitian limit by extending the perturbative considerations of @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .    throughout this work",
    "we denote eigenvalues as @xmath12 , but set @xmath13 ; all considerations thus directly apply to the eigenfrequencies in optical analogues of non - hermitian quantum systems .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a coupled - resonator geometry where one part of the system ( l ) is absorbing and the other part ( r ) is amplifying , with the absorption and amplification rate set to a matching value @xmath5 . in each part",
    "random multiple scattering at a rate @xmath14 results in a mixing of @xmath15 internal modes , where @xmath11 is the mean level spacing , and the two parts are coupled together at an interface which supports @xmath3 open channels of transparency @xmath16 , @xmath17 . in order to capture the consequences of multiple scattering we utilize effective hamiltonians and quantum maps , which model these systems as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the general structure of an effective hamiltonian for this situation can been derived in a systematic scattering approach @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath18 where the @xmath19-dimensional hermitian matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) represent the internal hermitian ( anti - hermitian ) dynamics in each part of the system , while the coupling matrix is of the specific form @xmath24 the specific form of ( [ eq : h ] ) displays a structure which goes beyond the mere symmetry requirements usually applied in mathematical classifications of nonhermitian matrices ( for comprehensive overviews see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the matrix @xmath25 needs to be positive definite and bounded in order to model physical coupling between two resonators .",
    "this structure resembles analogous models in mesoscopic superconductivity , where the two subspaces represent particles and holes , and the coupling is provided by andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "we now impose two different versions of generalized time - reversal symmetry .",
    "traditional @xmath0 symmetry involves the parity operator @xmath26 , where the pauli matrix @xmath27 interchanges the subspaces r and l , as well as the time reversal operation @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the complex conjugation in a given basis , assumed to coincide with the basis of ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "invariance under the joint @xmath0 operation then demands @xmath30 in a @xmath0-symmetric basis , the secular polynomial @xmath31 has real coefficients , which constraints each eigenvalue to be real or being partnered by its complex conjugate .    in hermitian situations ,",
    "the complex conjugation @xmath32 is equivalent to taking the transpose of the matrix ( thus passing from the right eigenvalue problem to the left eigenvalue problem ) . in non - hermitian situations ,",
    "this transposition amounts to an independent operation , denoted as @xmath33 @xcite . for a @xmath1-symmetric situation",
    ", we now obtain the constraints @xmath34 which is of interest as this yields the same spectral constraints as @xmath0 symmetry .    for each of these two cases ,",
    "a number of ensembles can now be formulated depending on the presence or absence of additional symmetries for @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in particular , we consider the cases that they may be further constrained to be real and thus symmetric ( labeled o for orthogonal ) , complex ( labeled u for unitary ) , or purely imaginary and thus antisymmetric ( labeled a ) . in combination , we then arrive at 9 symmetry classes with @xmath0-symmetry , denoted as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as well as 8 additional classes @xmath39 with @xmath1-symmetry ( oo and oo@xmath6 coincide as in this case @xmath33 is an independent symmetry ) .    a detailed discussion of the physical requirements corresponding to the various symmetries in optical settings is given in @xcite . motivated by this context",
    ", we focus on 5 situations ,",
    "oo , uo , uo@xmath6 , oa and oa@xmath6 . the most important scenario is that of oo symmetry , with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which includes ordinary optical systems with gain and loss modeled by a complex refractive index .",
    "the cases of uo and uo@xmath6 symmetry ( @xmath41 but @xmath42 not further constrained ) model systems with elastic magneto - optical effects , with different symmetry constraints imposed on the effective magnetic field .",
    "we will also consider the oa and oa@xmath6 cases , as it is known that absorption can be provided by magneto - optical devices @xcite ( in practice , however the design of a matching magneto - optical amplification may prove challenging ) .",
    "the described symmetry classes are converted into statistical ensembles under convenient sampling of the @xmath19-dimensional hermitian matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "specifically , depending on whether @xmath44 or u we choose @xmath42 from the standard gaussian orthogonal or unitary ensemble ( goe or gue ) of random matrix theory @xcite , respectively .",
    "the variance @xmath45 of the matrix elements is set such that the probability distribution of eigenvalues @xmath12 becomes stationary in the large-@xmath2 limit , corresponding to a wigner semicircle law with radius 2 , @xmath46    for @xmath47 symmetry of the anti - hermitian part , we model uniform absorption and amplification by setting @xmath48 . for the case @xmath49 , we model @xmath50 via a real antisymmetric matrix with random gaussian elements , and quantify the degree of non - hermiticity by @xmath51 .    throughout , we will model the coupling between the two parts of the system via @xmath52 channels of identical transparency @xmath4 .",
    "together with the chosen energy scaling ( [ eq : semicircle ] ) , which gives @xmath53 , the coupling matrix ( [ eq : gamma ] ) then takes the form @xmath54 , with @xmath3 finite diagonal entries @xmath55 .",
    "we denote these ensembles as g@xmath37e or g@xmath37e@xmath6 , and specifically consider the cases gooe , guoe , guoe@xmath6 , gaoe , and gaoe@xmath6 , which correspond to the optical settings described in the previous subsection .",
    "an alternative approach in random - matrix theory bases the considerations on circular ensembles of effective time - evolution operators @xcite . for the coupled - resonator geometry ,",
    "the general structure of these operators has been identified in @xcite .",
    "they take the form of a quantum map @xmath56 which delivers quasienergies @xmath57 via the eigenvalue problem @xmath58 the properties of the interface are now encoded in the parameter @xmath59 , the rank-@xmath3 projector @xmath60 , and the complementary projector @xmath61 .",
    "the internal dynamics are described by the @xmath62-dimensional unitary matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which satisfy @xmath65 for @xmath0 symmetry , and @xmath66 for @xmath1 symmetry .",

    "( in the specified form , ( [ eq : map ] ) holds for @xmath47 symmetry with uniform amplification and absorption , but by the replacement @xmath67 can be adapted to other symmetries . )",
    "appropriate random - matrix ensembles follow by choosing @xmath68 from the standard circular orthogonal or unitary ensembles ( coe or cue ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "we denote these circular ensembles with @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetry as c@xmath37e and c@xmath37e@xmath6 , respectively .      in summary ,",
    "each rmt ensemble is specified by the symmetry @xmath37 , as well the following 4 dimensionless parameters : the number of modes @xmath15 in each of the two parts of the system , the relative size @xmath69 of the interface , the transparency @xmath4 of the interface ( encoded in @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) , and the degree of non - hermiticity @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the thouless parameter mentioned in the introduction . in the hamiltonian variants of rmt , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , while in the quantum map version with @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in order to get insight into the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane , and the conditions under which they may accumulate on the real axis , we first consider the limit of a large number of internal modes @xmath79 , at fixed @xmath69 , @xmath72 and @xmath4 .",
    "for an optical system , this limit is realized by decreasing the wavelength ( increasing the frequency ) in a given resonator geometry while keeping the absorption and amplification rate @xmath5 at a wavelength - independent value . in random - matrix theory",
    ", this limit can be approached via systematic diagrammatic expansions , where the leading order captures the averaged eigenvalues density neglecting fluctuations on the scale of the level spacing @xcite .",
    "we now adapt this approach to the symmetries in question .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath80 generally possesses complex eigenvalues , and the complex - analysis nature of the method employed below suggests to denote these as @xmath81 . the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane",
    "can then be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the @xmath84-dimensional top - left block of the @xmath85-dimensional matrix green function @xmath86 the limit @xmath87 is implied to be taken at the end of the calculation .    in order to work out the random - matrix average",
    "we expand the matrix green function as a geometric series @xmath88 where the momentarily stipulated form of @xmath89 holds for the gooe and guoe@xmath6 ensembles ( the other ensembles are discussed thereafter ) .",
    "the average can now be carried out by contractions of the gaussian random variables in @xmath42 , which can be represented diagrammatically . the leading order ( the planar limit )",
    "is given by rainbow diagrams in which the contraction lines do not cross , @xmath90 which sum up to @xmath91\\bar{\\cal g } \\rightarrow \\bar{\\cal g}=({\\cal u}^{-1}-g\\otimes { \\mathbf{1}}_m)^{-1 } , \\label{eq : rainbow}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is a reduced @xmath93 matrix green function .",
    "the matrix @xmath94 on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : rainbow ] ) separates into @xmath3 blocks of the form @xmath95 and @xmath96 blocks of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 we thus can invert each block separately , and take the partial trace on both sides .",
    "this leads to the generalized pastur equation @xmath99 for the gooe and guoe@xmath6 ensembles .    for the guoe ensemble , ( [ eq : geom ] )",
    "holds with @xmath100 .",
    "the transpositions reduce the number of rainbow diagrams in the gaussian average , which leads to the modified equation @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    for the goae ensemble",
    ", the random matrix @xmath104 has to be incorporated into @xmath105 , while @xmath106 is replaced by @xmath107 .",
    "instead , @xmath5 appears via the contractions of @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "finally , in the goae@xmath6 ensemble we have @xmath111 , and @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : pastur ] ) can be rephrased as @xmath114 thus , a third - degree matrix polynomial , and the versions ( [ eq : pastur2])([eq : pastur4 ] ) can be rewritten analogously .",
    "if we write @xmath115 in terms of its 16 components and eliminate these successively , we end up with a polynomial of a very large degree , which prohibits an exact analytical solution .",
    "therefore , we pursue a semi - analytical approach which starts with the exact solution @xmath116 in the uncoupled case @xmath117 , where @xmath118 ( independently of @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is solved by @xmath119 , where the square root of the matrix @xmath120 is defined by diagonalization , @xmath121 , which here can be carried out explicitly as @xmath29 decouples into two independent @xmath122-dimensional blocks .",
    "the correct branch is determined by the limit @xmath123 .    to describe the following steps let us denote the desired solution of ( [ eq : pastur ] ) as @xmath124 .",
    "now , we proceed as follows : ( i ) we determine @xmath125 for a fixed value of @xmath126 ( e.g. , @xmath127 ) and a finite value of @xmath128 ( concretely chosen to equal the eventual value of @xmath129 , as we expect the support of the spectrum to be of that order ) .",
    "( ii ) for values @xmath129 increasing in small increments from zero to the desired final value , we solve ( [ eq : pastur ] ) numerically for @xmath124 , where the initial condition is taken as the solution from the previous step .",
    "( iii ) analogously , we next decrease the value of @xmath128 to a small value ( here taken as @xmath130 ; keeping @xmath128 small but finite regularizes branch cuts ) .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to solve ( [ eq : pastur2])([eq : pastur4 ] ) .    in practice , we find that a reliable numerical approximation of the desired solution @xmath131 is obtained in a few ( about 10 ) steps",
    ". we can next keep @xmath129 and @xmath128 fixed but vary @xmath81 in small steps to sample the complex @xmath81 plane .",
    "furthermore , by considering @xmath132 as a formally independent variable we can also obtain the numerical derivatives required for the calculation of the eigenvalue probability density @xmath133    ( a , b ) same as figure [ fig : tall ] , but for the guoe ensemble .",
    "( c , d ) analogous results for the goae and goae@xmath6 ensembles , respectively , with @xmath134 . ]    the lower panels in figure [ fig : tall ] illustrate the resulting eigenvalue distribution for the case of the gooe and guoe@xmath6 ensembles , governed by ( [ eq : pastur ] ) , as density plots for @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , for two different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the top panels show the eigenvalues of @xmath138 random gooe matrices with @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig : tallgue ] shows the corresponding results for the guoe ensemble , as well as results for the goae and goae@xmath6 ensembles for a single value of @xmath5 , obtained from ( [ eq : pastur2 ] ) , ( [ eq : pastur3 ] ) and ( [ eq : pastur4 ] ) , respectively . in all cases there is excellent agreement , which includes details such as the branches of the eigenvalue support extending along the real axis in the range @xmath141 , observed for the gooe and goae@xmath6 ensembles .",
    "( we also confirmed quantitative agreement by comparing histograms at fixed @xmath142 . )",
    "the one feature which is not captured by the diagrammatic expansion is the visible accumulation of eigenvalues in the whole range @xmath143 along the real axis .",
    "however , we find numerically that with the present scaling of parameters ( @xmath72 fixed independently of @xmath2 ) , the fraction of these eigenvalues amongst all eigenvalues steadily decreases @xmath144 as @xmath2 increases , indicating that the real component of the spectrum indeed becomes negligible in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier prediction for the gooe and the goue @xcite that the transition to a complex spectrum happens for a characteristic value @xmath9 which is much less than @xmath145 if @xmath2 is large .",
    "these features render the transition out of the reach of the described diagrammatic approach . in the following sections",
    ", we will first study the transition in detail based on direct numerical sampling and diagonalization of the random - matrix ensembles , and then extend the perturbative treatment of @xcite to quantify the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the transition from real to complex - conjugate pairs of eigenvalues can be quantified by considering the fraction @xmath146 of eigenvalues which are complex ; @xmath147 indicates a fully real spectrum , while @xmath148 if the spectrum is fully complex .",
    "we determine this fraction numerically as a function of the non - hermiticity parameter @xmath5 , while keeping @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 fixed . in the gaussian ensembles ,",
    "the energy levels are taken only from the central region @xmath149 of the spectrum , where @xmath150 is approximately constant .",
    "this eliminates the spectral edge effects observed in some of the eigenvalue distributions in the previous sections , and represents the typical physical conditions met in the short - wavelength limit of realistic resonators ( where the effective level index is large , and the spectrum is not bounded from above ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath47 ( uniform absorption and amplification ) , we compare the results to the circular ensembles , as in these the mean level spacing is energy independent .",
    "( for @xmath49 the quantum maps are less convenient . )",
    "our eventual goal is to characterize the transition in the different ensembles by the coupling dependence of the critical scale @xmath151 which we identify via @xmath152 ( without requiring exact equality ) .",
    "the scale @xmath153 is chosen such that the function @xmath154 does not depend on @xmath2 and @xmath3 if @xmath155 ( with possible exceptions for weak coupling @xmath156 , as specified below ) . by varying @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "independently we find that this scale depends on the symmetry @xmath47 or a , and can be suitably written as @xmath157 this being fixed , we set @xmath158 and @xmath159 and determine @xmath160 for various values of @xmath4 with @xmath5 measured in units of the appropriate @xmath153 , as shown in figures [ fig : fc1][fig : fc4 ] , and focus the discussion on the ensemble - specific form of the scaling function @xmath154 in ( [ eq : gdef ] ) .    in the gooe and cooe ( figure [ fig : fc1 ] ) , we find that the transition becomes coupling - independent as soon as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 in this regime @xmath163 ; the slight @xmath4-dependence still observed in the plots are finite - size effects , which disappear if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are further increased .",
    "( however , in this limit @xmath164 becomes very small , so that the behaviour for @xmath165 would be difficult to illustrate ; the chosen values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 thus constitute a suitable compromise . ) in the guoe and cuoe ( figure [ fig : fc2 ] ) , on the other hand , the transition displays coupling dependence throughout the whole range of @xmath4 .",
    "these results for oo and uo symmetry agree with the predictions in @xcite , which we systemize in the following section to develop a microscopic picture that also applies to the remaining ensembles considered here .",
    "the numerical results for these cases are as follows .    in the guoe@xmath6 and cuoe@xmath6 ( figure [ fig : fc3 ] )",
    ", the transition displays a similar coupling independence as in the gooe and cooe , with @xmath9 ( and thus @xmath154 ) roughly scaled down by a factor of about @xmath166 .    in the goae and goae@xmath6 ( figure [ fig : fc4 ] ) , the scale @xmath167 applies . in both ensembles ,",
    "there is almost no coupling dependence throughout the whole range of @xmath4 , with exception of the weak - coupling regime @xmath168 in the goae@xmath6 , which is now delineated by @xmath169 interestingly , in this regime @xmath154 decreases with increasing @xmath4 , which amounts to an anomalous behaviour  the coupling between the resonators enhances the fragility of the real spectrum , in contrast to the usual situation where increasing the coupling furthers the balance of the non - hermitian effects in the system .",

    "the transition is almost coupling independent , with exception of the weak - coupling regime @xmath177 of the goae@xmath6 , where the characteristic scale @xmath9 increases as @xmath178 . ]",
    "to explain the observations of the previous section , we now develop a microscopic picture of the transition from a real to complex spectrum .",
    "this is based on two ingredients , the level statistics in the hermitian limit @xmath179 , and the interaction of the eigenvalues on the real axis as @xmath5 is increased .",
    "focussing on these two ingredients is motivated by the fact that the formation of complex eigenvalues requires two real eigenvalues to coalesce .",
    "the required degree of nonhermiticity thus depends on the distance of the levels at @xmath179 , and the typical size of the matrix elements which mix the levels .",
    "the ensembles studied here display different degrees of level repulsion and level mixing , which also depend on the coupling strength @xmath4 , and our aim is to show that these characteristics are consistent with the coupling dependence of the complex fraction @xmath146 reported in the previous section .",
    "we start with some preliminary observations that justify to separate the problem of level spacing statistics at @xmath179 from the problem of level mixing at finite @xmath5 .",
    "first , we note that at @xmath179 , @xmath180 , the system consists of two uncoupled passive resonators , which both have an identical real spectrum . in order to inspect how this degeneracy is lifted ,",
    "we pass over to a @xmath181-symmetric basis , @xmath182 , where @xmath183 diagonalizes @xmath27 , which gives @xmath184    in the hermitian limit @xmath179 ( implying also @xmath185 ) , all these transformed hamiltonians are block diagonal , with exception of ( [ eq : h2 ] ) for the guoe .",
    "this is the case because in the other cases @xmath181 is an exact symmetry ; moreover , for the gooe , goae , and goae@xmath6 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 hold separately if @xmath179 or @xmath185 .",
    "these properties lead to different level statistics in the hermitian limit , which in all cases but for the guoe involve the superposition of two non - interacting level sequences @xmath186 and @xmath187 , obtained from @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "the two sequences are degenerate at @xmath180 , but are modified by @xmath25 , which perturbs the two sequences in different ways , and because of its positive definiteness also induces an approximately rigid shift .    in the non - hermitian case ( finite @xmath5 or @xmath104 ) the @xmath181 symmetry remains exact in the goae , while @xmath33 symmetry remains exact in the gooe and @xmath32 symmetry remains exact in the goae and in the goae@xmath6 .",
    "these differences are reflected in the matrix elements that mix the level sequences .",
    "for this , we recall that in almost - degenerate perturbation theory , the effective hamiltonian of two adjacent levels @xmath190 and @xmath191 is @xmath192 where @xmath193 is a generic perturbation .",
    "the perturbation theory is straightforward at small @xmath4 , but as @xmath4 increases levels display exact or avoided crossings .",
    "one can then still base estimates by stipulating a typical spacing @xmath11 of two adjacent levels at finite @xmath4 , and restricting the perturbative analysis to the wavefunction overlap @xcite .    as a backdrop for the ensemble - dependent discussion of the details , we show in figures [ fig : ps1 ] and [ fig : ps2 ] numerically evaluated level - spacing statistics @xmath194 at @xmath179 , where @xmath195 is the distance between adjacent levels . in the gaussian ensembles , we focus again on the bulk of the spectrum ( close @xmath196 ) ; for @xmath47 these results are also compared with results from the circular ensembles ( as before @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) .     and @xmath159 .",
    "these results also apply to the goae@xmath6 and coae@xmath6 . ]    in figure [ fig : ps1 ] , @xmath194 is shown for the gooe and cooe .",
    "the data applies to the full spectrum of @xmath197 , thus , the superposition of the sequences @xmath198 and @xmath199 of @xmath200 at @xmath179 ( with mean level spacing @xmath201 ) , which is appropriate as these sequences become mixed by finite @xmath5 . at small coupling @xmath202 ,",
    "the statistics is dominated by the closeness of levels which degenerate at @xmath180 .",
    "based on ( [ eq : hpert ] ) , one then finds @xmath203 , thus @xmath204 .",
    "for @xmath161 , levels in the two sequences cross ( giving @xmath205 ) , and the spacing statistics quickly converges to a coupling - independent form . at finite @xmath5 , adjacent levels of the different sequences @xmath206 and",
    "@xmath207 with @xmath208 are mixed by a matrix element of squared size @xmath209 @xcite , which becomes comparable to @xmath210 at @xmath211 , up to factors of order unity because of the influence of the level fluctuations .",
    "this qualitatively explains the approximate coupling - independence of @xmath160 , observed for this ensemble in the previous section ( figure [ fig : fc1 ] ) .",
    "one can interpolate between the weak - coupling and finite - coupling regimes by setting @xmath212 .    , but for the guoe and cuoe ( left panel ) , the guoe@xmath6 and cuoe@xmath6 ( middle panel ) , and a single block @xmath188 , corresponding to the levels that are mixed by finite @xmath104 in the goae ( right panel ) ]    the left panel of figure [ fig : ps2 ] shows the analogous result for the guoe and cuoe . here , finite @xmath25 also induces a mixing of the originally degenerate sequences @xmath198 and @xmath199 , which results in a coupling - dependent level repulsion ( with @xmath213 ) .",
    "this corresponds well to the persistent coupling dependence of @xmath160 , observed in figure [ fig : fc2 ] .",
    "based on ( [ eq : hpert ] ) , one now finds @xmath214 @xcite , thus @xmath215 , which holds across the whole range of @xmath4 , up to modifications of order unity , which we now can associate to the influence of the level statistics .    in the guoe@xmath6 and cuoe@xmath6 ( middle panel of figure [ fig : ps2 ] ) , on the other hand , levels are again not mixed by finite @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a coupling - independent level statistics again emerges for @xmath161 , with is similar to the result for the gooe / cooe ( figure [ fig : ps1 ] ) , with @xmath216 .",
    "the modal value is shifted to slightly larger @xmath195 , in accordance with the larger degree of level repulsion in the standard gue / cue @xcite .",
    "this behaviour corresponds well to the approximate coupling - independence of @xmath160 in figure [ fig : fc3 ] .",
    "we find in the perturbative treatment that @xmath154 is the same as in the gooe , up to a possible factor of order unity due to the small differences in the level spacing statistics .    in the goae",
    ", the superimposed level sequences display the same statistics as in the gooe .",
    "however , @xmath104 does not mix these sequences ; instead , eigenvalue coalescence must happen within a given sequence .",
    "therefore , we consider the spacing within a fixed sequence , which is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : ps2 ] ( here the mean levels spacing is @xmath217 ) .",
    "the result is almost indistinguishable from the standard wigner distribution of the goe ( with @xmath218 for small @xmath195 ) @xcite , as the main effect of @xmath25 is a rigid shift ; small deviations appear only for @xmath219 .",
    "this agrees well the corresponding behaviour of @xmath160 in figure [ fig : fc4](a ) .",
    "perturbatively , the mixing is given by overlaps @xmath220 of size @xmath221 , which must be of order @xmath210 for eigenvalues to coalesce .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath222 ( up to a factor of order unity ) , which is independent of @xmath3 .    the data in figure [ fig : ps1 ] also applies to the goae@xmath6 , which shows a similar coupling independence , figure [ fig : fc4](b ) , as the gooe and guoe@xmath6",
    ". the anomalous behaviour at small @xmath4 can be understood from the fact that in this regime eigenvalue coalescence predominantly occurs between levels @xmath206 , @xmath223 of the two sequences that are degenerate at @xmath224 .",
    "thus , perturbatively their eigenvectors @xmath225 are identical , and the first - order coupling @xmath226 because @xmath104 is antisymmetric ( and @xmath227 is real ) . for @xmath228 , on the other hand , the coalescence is between originally non - degenerate levels of the two sequences , and @xmath229 ( up to a factor of order unity , and again independent of @xmath3 ) , as in the goae .",
    "in summary , motivated by recent optical realizations of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems , we identified a number of symmetry classes which can be realized in optical resonators and differ by a choice between two generalized time reversal symmetries ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , as well as the absence or presence of magneto - optical effects in the hermitian and nonhermitian parts of the dynamics .",
    "specifically we considered five scenarios , with symmetries termed oo , uo , uo@xmath6 , oa and oa@xmath6 .    our analytical results reveal that in the short - wave limit , the fraction of real eigenvalues among all eigenvalues in the spectrum decays to zero at any classically finite amplification and absorption rate @xmath5 .",
    "based on numerical results , and an extension of the perturbative results in @xcite , we find that the amplification and absorption rate @xmath230 at which real eigenvalues turn complex is indeed characterized by a scale @xmath231 which is classically small but microscopically large .",
    "furthermore , the scenarios differ in the dependence @xmath154 on the coupling strength @xmath4 between the absorbing and amplifying components , which can be explained in terms of the level spacing statistics in the hermitian limit @xmath179 , and distinct mechanisms of how these levels are then mixed when @xmath5 is finite . for uo symmetry ,",
    "the transition is @xmath4-dependent over the whole range of this parameter . in the oo and uo@xmath6 classes ,",
    "a significant dependence is only observed for @xmath232 , while the oa@xmath6 symmetry class displays an anomalous dependence of the transition on the coupling strength in the range @xmath177 . in the oa symmetry class , there is negligible coupling dependence over the whole range of @xmath4 .",
    "the introduced models possess a structure that respects the constraints imposed by characteristic energy and time scales , the physical nature of the amplification and absorption , and the accessible coupling strengths of a realistic ( possibly semitransparent ) interface .",
    "the classification of these models can be straightforwardly extended to include any symplectic , chiral , particle - hole like , or additional geometric symmetries , as previously discussed in hermitian situations @xcite .    in this work we focussed on ensemble - specific spectral properties .",
    "however , as is generally the case in random - matrix theory , there are many quantities that are less ensemble - specific and should display a large degree of universality .",
    "the prime example is the spectral statistics of the complex eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "if one is interested in such statistics , simpler models can be employed .",
    "for example , in scattering theory @xcite the effective hamiltonian has a semidefinite antihermitian part , but the bulk spectral statistics can be studied via the ginibre ensemble with complex entries @xcite .",
    "analogously , the spectral constraints of @xmath0 or @xmath1 symmetry are also obeyed by the real ginibre ensemble , which has a much simpler matrix structure than our ensembles , and for which detailed rigorous results are available @xcite . that this ensemble is a good model for other non - hermitian ensembles has been demonstrated , e.g. , for the case of lattice qcd in @xcite .",
    "notably , in this ensemble , in the stipulated limit with fixed classical scales , the fraction of real eigenvalues decays as @xmath233 @xcite .",
    "an important constraint in the applicability range of any random - matrix ensemble is the requirement that many modes are well mixed by multiple scattering .",
    "this is not the case in ( quasi ) one dimensional @xmath0-symmetric disordered systems , where states are localized and the transition happens at much smaller values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even in wave - chaotic settings the multiple scattering can be suppressed by dynamical effects , which can lead to systematic corrections for the density of eigenvalues , as observed in @xcite for the strongly amplified states in a quantum - chaotic system .",
