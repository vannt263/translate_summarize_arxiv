    "exclusive double - diffractive - like processes of the type @xmath5 can significantly increase the physics potential of high energy proton colliders . here",
    "@xmath6 represents a system of invariant mass @xmath6 , and the + signs denote the presence of rapidity gaps which separate the system @xmath6 from the protons .",
    "such processes allow , on the one hand , novel studies of qcd and of the diffractive amplitude at very high energies , while , on the other hand , allow an exceptionally clean experimental environment to identify new physics signals ( such as the higgs boson , susy particles , etc . , see @xcite and ref . therein ) .",
    "moreover tagging two forward protons offers an attractive extension of the proton collider physics programme to studies of high - energy @xmath7 collision physics ; see , for example , [ 13 ] .",
    "in such events we produce a colour - singlet state @xmath6 which is practically free from soft secondary particles . moreover , if forward going protons are tagged we can reconstruct the ` missing ' mass @xmath6 with good resolution , and so have an ideal means to search for new resonances and to study threshold behaviour phenomena .",
    "we have to pay a price for ensuring such a clean diffractive signal .",
    "in particular , the diffractive event rate is suppressed by the small probability , @xmath8 , that the rapidity gaps survive soft rescattering effects between the interacting hadrons , which can generate secondary particles which populate the gaps [ 412 ] . in general , we may write the survival factor @xmath8 in a multi - channel eikonal framework in the form @xmath9 where the incoming proton is decomposed into diffractive eigenstates , each with its own opacity , where the indices refer to the eigenstates of the two incoming and two outgoing hadrons @xcite . ]",
    "the amplitudes @xmath11 of the process of interest may be different in the different diffractive eigenstates .",
    "they are expressed in impact parameter @xmath12 space at centre - of - mass energy @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to recall that the suppression factor @xmath8 is not universal , but depends on the particular hard subprocess , as well as on the kinematical configurations of the parent reaction , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "double - diffractive higgs production , @xmath14 at the lhc , is a good example of illustrating the pros and cons of such exclusive processes .",
    "let us assume a higgs boson of mass @xmath15 and consider detection in the @xmath16 decay channel .",
    "the disadvantage is that to ensure the survival of the rapidity gaps in ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , the predicted cross section is low , @xmath17 , corresponding to a survival factor @xmath18 .",
    "the advantage is that , _ by tagging the outgoing protons _ , the signal - to - background ratio ) corresponds to a cut on the @xmath19 jet transverse momenta of @xmath20 . ]",
    "is extremely favourable relative to other higgs signals @xcite , @xmath21 if the missing mass resolution @xmath22 obtained by the proton taggers is @xmath23 . indeed , with dedicated forward proton spectrometers at the lhc",
    ", the process @xmath24 may even be the light higgs discovery channel .    for completeness",
    ", we note that for higgs production via photon - photon fusion , the survival factor is much larger , @xmath25 @xcite , and the corresponding cross section @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the signal - to - background ratio is @xmath27    there are other physics reasons why it is desirable to tag the recoil protons in double diffractive processes .",
    "first , it offers a valuable experimental probe of the opacities @xmath28 of the proton .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "there is appreciable interference between the amplitudes without and with the soft rescattering corrections , which are shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) respectively .",
    "we will show that the interference depends on the transverse momenta @xmath29 of the recoil protons and on the azimuthal angle @xmath30 between these momenta .",
    "this dependence can be used to probe and hence scan the opacity @xmath31 . ] the different soft rescattering models and the behaviour of the opacities @xmath28 .    secondly , we need to understand , and if possible to predict , the @xmath32 behaviour of the diffractive cross sections in order to plan experiments and to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of the leading proton detectors at the lhc .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we recall how the bare perturbative amplitude @xmath33 of fig .",
    "1(a ) may be calculated , and then in section  3 we illustrate the effect of rescattering corrections in terms of a simple model . throughout the paper , it is safe to neglect the rescattering of the centrally produced system @xmath6 on either proton .",
    "this system ( for example , a higgs boson , high @xmath34 dijet , etc . ) is massive and has small size , so , due to colour transparency @xcite , the cross section @xmath35 is very small .",
    "rescattering is computed realistically in section  4 and the predictions for a general double - diffractive process , @xmath36 , are presented in section  5 .",
    "a detour is made in section  6 to discuss double - diffractive light meson production , for which data already exist .",
    "of course , this is beyond the region of validity of a perturbative qcd approach , but , surprisingly , the perturbative predictions agree qualitatively with interesting features of these data .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  7 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath33 of fig .",
    "1(a ) , describing the high energy double - diffractive production of a heavy system @xmath6 , can be expressed in terms of the generalised ( skewed ) unintegrated gluon densities @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the scale of the hard @xmath39 subprocess , and @xmath40 is the transverse momentum squared transferred through the ` hard ' qcd pomeron ( that is the two - gluon system ) .",
    "essentially the gluon distribution @xmath41 opens up and describes the internal structure of the ` hard ' qcd pomeron , whose exchange mediates the diffractive process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",
    "for the exclusive reaction ( [ eq : a1 ] ) the bare amplitude of fig .",
    "1(a ) is , to single log accuracy , given by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the matrix element of the hard @xmath39 subprocess . for example , the cross section for the @xmath44 subprocess , relevant to high @xmath34 dijet production @xcite , is    @xmath45    for small @xmath46 , which is appropriate for high energy double diffraction , and @xmath47 , the skewed unintegrated density @xmath41 can be calculated from knowledge of the conventional integrated gluon @xcite .",
    "the precise form of the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath41 is not well known .",
    "recall , however , that @xmath48 contains a sudakov - like factor @xmath49 which reflects the chance that a gluon with transverse momentum @xmath50 remains untouched in the evolution up to the hard scale @xmath51a necessary condition for the survival of the rapidity gap , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "it is this @xmath52 factor which provides the infrared stability of the @xmath50 integral of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) domain @xcite . ] .",
    "for example , for the production of a system of mass @xmath53 at the lhc , the saddle point of the @xmath54 integration occurs at @xmath55@xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , the transferred momenta satisfy @xmath57 , which are small in comparison with @xmath54 .",
    "therefore it is natural to assume the factorization @xmath58 where the whole @xmath40 dependence is given by the effective form - factor @xmath59 of the qcd pomeron - proton vertex . in other words",
    ", we separate the dependence of the @xmath60 cross section on the transverse variables ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) from the dependence on the ` longitudinal ' variables ( the initial @xmath63 energy @xmath13 , the mass @xmath6 and rapidity @xmath64 of the system @xmath6 ) . that is the bare amplitude",
    "is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and where @xmath67 may be calculated from ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",

    "1(b ) , it is convenient to use the momentum representation",
    ". we may neglect the spin - flip component in the proton - pomeron vertex of the neutron and proton cancel each other almost exactly . ] .",
    "we perform the detailed calculation in section 4 , but , first , we estimate the qualitative features of the rescattering effect by assuming , in this section , that the amplitude for elastic proton - proton scattering , at energy @xmath13 and momentum transfer @xmath69 , has the simplified form @xmath70 from the optical theorem we have @xmath71 , and for the small contribution of the real part it is sufficient to use @xmath72 in the energy regime of interest . @xmath73 is the slope of the elastic @xmath63 differential cross section , @xmath74 .    using the above elastic @xmath63 amplitude we may write the rescattering contribution , fig .",
    "1(b ) , to the @xmath75 amplitude as @xmath76 where now @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    ". if we take an exponential form for the qcd pomeron vertices , @xmath79 then the integral in ( [ eq : a9 ] ) can be evaluated , to give @xmath80    to gain insight it is useful to compute the numerical value of @xmath68 at the lhc energy using reasonable values of the parameters .",
    "we take @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and , for the moment , neglect the real part , @xmath84 , of the @xmath63 elastic amplitude .",
    "we obtain @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "thus in the back - to back configuration with @xmath87 , the absorptive correction @xmath68 completely cancels the bare amplitude @xmath33 , and we predict a deep diffractive dip .",
    "moreover we see that the position of the dip depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath30 between the transverse momenta @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the tagged protons .",
    "for @xmath90 the momentum transfer occurs mainly through the elastic amplitude @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 minimized simultaneously , and hence the amplitude @xmath68 becomes larger .",
    "to make a realistic calculation of the rescattering corrections we must improve the description of @xmath63 soft interaction .",
    "we use the model of ref .",
    "it embodies ( i )  pion - loop insertions to the pomeron trajectory , ( ii )  two - channel eikonal description of proton - proton rescattering and ( iii ) high mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "the parameters of the model were tuned to describe all the main features of the soft @xmath63 data throughout the cern - isr to the tevatron energy interval . in terms of the two channel eikonal the incoming proton",
    "is described by two diffractive eigenstates @xmath94 , each with its own absorptive cross section .    the eigenstates were taken to have the same profile in impact parameter space , and absorptive cross sections @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is defined in ref .",
    "that is the two channel opacity is @xmath98 the impact parameter representation of the elastic amplitude is thus @xmath99 \\right ) .\\ ] ] when we allow for the extra @xmath100 factors , which reflect the different pomeron couplings to the two diffractive eigenstates in the @xmath101 production amplitude , that is in the right - hand part of fig .",
    "1(b ) , we obtain the effective amplitude of @xmath63 rescattering , @xmath102 \\right ) .\\ ] ] the optical density @xmath103 was given in ref .",
    "@xcite for tevatron @xmath104 and lhc @xmath105 energies .",
    "as before , we work in momentum space , and replace ( [ eq : a8 ] ) by @xmath106 in this way we obtain a more realistic evaluation of the rescattering amplitude @xmath68 of fig .  1(b )",
    ". however , from the nave evaluation of section  3 , we anticipate that there will still be a strong cancellation between the bare amplitude @xmath33 and the absorptive correction @xmath68 , originating from the imaginary part of the elastic rescattering @xmath91 .",
    "first , we must introduce the real part of @xmath107 .",
    "however , it is not justified to use a constant ratio @xmath108 for @xmath69 away from zero . to account for the @xmath69 dependence we use the dispersion relation result , recalling that the total @xmath63 cross section increases logarithmically with energy",
    ". then the even - signature amplitude satisfies @xmath109 to convert this relation from the impact parameter space amplitude @xmath110 to the momentum space amplitude @xmath107 we use ( [ eq : a18 ] ) .",
    "second , we should specify the form of the qcd pomeron - proton vertex , @xmath59 .",
    "the most consistent choice is to take the dipole form used in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath111 for comparison we also evaluated the @xmath112 cross section using the alternative form @xmath113 with @xmath81 , which is consistent with the @xmath114 hera data elastic photoproduction prefer @xmath115 .",
    "however , for a heavier system , the smaller slope @xmath116 looks more reasonable .",
    "we are now in a position to predict the transverse momentum dependence of the outgoing protons in the double - diffractive production of a heavy system of mass @xmath6 , that is in the process @xmath117 .",
    "we show the results in the form @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the pomeron - pomeron luminosity given in ref .",
    "@xcite and where the factor @xmath120 contains the explicit @xmath121 and @xmath122 dependence .",
    "the luminosity , given in @xcite , was integrated over @xmath123 with the assumption that the bare amplitude had an exponential @xmath40 behaviour , @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "in addition , the soft survival probability @xmath126 was averaged over the available @xmath61 domain . here",
    "we unfold the luminosity to expose the @xmath121 and @xmath122 dependence . in order to be able to use the published @xmath127 luminosity , we therefore compute @xmath128 from the product of @xmath120 , computed in this way , and the luminosity given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the luminosity as a function of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , as well as of @xmath64 and @xmath6 .",
    "this resultant luminosity , ( [ eq : a22 ] ) , needs only be multiplied by the appropriate hard subprocess @xmath129 cross section is to indicate that the hard gluons , which interact to form the system @xmath6 , originate within overall ( colourless ) hard pomeron exchanges . ] to obtain the differential cross section for any @xmath36 diffractive process .",
    "various hard subprocess cross sections were listed , and discussed , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath120 is plotted in figs .",
    "2(a , b , c ) as a function of @xmath130 for three values of @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively . in each case",
    "the factor is shown for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle between @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the continuous and dashed curves are obtained using ( [ eq : a20 ] ) and ( [ eq : a21 ] ) , respectively , for the qcd pomeron - proton vertex .",
    "recall that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite was fitted to ` soft ' diffractive @xmath63 data in the region @xmath135 , and so , strictly speaking , @xmath136 of ( [ eq : a20 ] ) should only be applied for @xmath137 .",
    "however , we hope we can reliably evaluate rescattering corrections up to @xmath138 , as the typical values of @xmath69 ( the momentum transferred through the elastic amplitude @xmath91 in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , which are controlled mainly by the elastic slope @xmath139 , are much less than @xmath23 .",
    "as discussed before , the absorptive corrections are stronger in the back - to - back configuration ; already for @xmath140 the @xmath141 curves reveal a rich dip structure .    in the final plot , fig .",
    "2(d ) , we compare the prediction for @xmath120 obtained using the elastic amplitude determined in the two - channel eikonal model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with a nave estimate based on a simple one - channel approach where the elastic @xmath63 amplitude is given by the gaussian formula of ( [ eq : a8 ] ) , that is the amplitude is described by single pomeron exchange .",
    "however , we keep the parameters found in @xcite , that is @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 at @xmath145 . in both cases we use ( [ eq : a21 ] ) for @xmath59 .",
    "the large difference between the realistic and nave predictions demonstrates their sensitivity to the model used for soft rescattering .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the azimuthal dependence of the ` soft ' survival factor @xmath146 as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath30 , for different choices of @xmath130 and @xmath147 . the rich structure of @xmath148 is apparent , which feeds through into the double - diffractive cross section . as anticipated , we observe a flatter behaviour in @xmath30 for small @xmath130 and @xmath147 , while for larger @xmath149 a diffractive dip already occurs for @xmath150 .",
    "an interesting @xmath30 behaviour has been observed by the wa102 collaboration at cern @xcite at lower energies ( @xmath151 ) in fixed target central double - diffractive meson production , @xmath152 where a partial wave analysis of the @xmath153 channel allows the identification of a wide range of meson resonances .",
    "it has been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite that within the regge framework the reggeon - reggeon@xmath154meson vertex , @xmath155 , embodied in the amplitude @xmath33 , may contain an azimuthal dependence like @xmath156 in fact , with an appropriate choice of parameters , a phenomenological description of the @xmath30 dependences observed in the meson - production data can be achieved without any rescattering corrections @xcite .",
    "for a hard subprocess at scale @xmath157 with @xmath158 we have no such dependence in the vertex @xmath159 ; the coefficients in ( [ eq : a27 ] ) satisfy @xmath160 . on the other hand , at least part of the azimuthal effects observed in the meson data @xcite may originate in the rescattering corrections discussed in the present paper .    to study this further",
    ", we adopt the perturbative qcd viewpoint , which offers a dynamical basis in which to understand the structure of process ( [ eq : a26 ] ) .",
    "of course , it is questionable to use perturbative qcd to describe the production of rather light mesons , via ( [ eq : a26 ] ) , where we have no hard scale . on the other hand",
    "it is natural to expect a smooth matching between the ` soft ' and perturbative regimes . in this way",
    "we may obtain a qualitative interpretation of observed features the data .",
    "as we shall see below , this indeed turns out to be the case .",
    "recall that , in general , for forward going protons ( @xmath161 ) , two ` hard ' qcd pomerons can produce only a p - even state with the longitudinal projection of its spin @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "also note that , as the qcd pomerons are built from gluons , the underlying fusion subprocess @xmath163 may provide a favourable environment for the production of exotic meson states containing gluons ( such as glueballs , hybrids , etc . )",
    "; the cross section of the @xmath164 subprocess is much smaller than that of @xmath165 , especially in the @xmath166 channel .",
    "next for @xmath166 the vertex @xmath167 is strongly suppressed if the @xmath0 state is a normal non - relativistic @xmath1 meson decay mode of @xmath0 positronium in the @xmath166 state @xcite , and then to the absence of the @xmath168 decay of a @xmath169 @xmath1 system @xcite . ] .",
    "this is the result of gauge invariance .",
    "indeed , for @xmath153 made from a non - relativistic @xmath1 pair , the fusion process @xmath170 looks like a single local vertex .",
    "the distance between the two gluon vertices is of the order of the inverse constituent quark mass ( @xmath171 ) , which is much smaller than the size of the ( @xmath1 ) bound state .",
    "now , the structure of the local @xmath172 interaction is fixed by gluon gauge invariance .",
    "then the requirement that the polarization tensor @xmath173 of the @xmath0 meson satisfies @xmath174 means that the vertex vanishes for @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "the consequence is that the forward double - diffractive production of normal quarkonium @xmath175 states should be suppressed @xcite , and so pomeron - pomeron fusion produces relatively more exotic ( non-@xmath1 ) mesons , such as glueballs , @xmath176 states , etc . in other words",
    "the process @xmath177 indeed acts as a filter for separating out exotic mesons from normal mesons @xcite .",
    "the next observation is that mesons produced in the process @xmath178 by pomeron - pomeron fusion have larger transverse momenta , @xmath179 , where @xmath180 .",
    "the reasons are that ( i )  the @xmath166 selection rule is absent at larger @xmath181 , ( ii )  for a @xmath182 meson , the vertex contains a factor @xmath183 and so prefers larger @xmath181 and @xmath184 , should be strongly suppressed and also favours large @xmath181 .",
    "this does not depend on whether or not the mesons are quarkonium states . also , @xmath185 production would tend to occur at large @xmath181 . ] , and , finally , ( iii )  heavier ( exotic ) mesons mesons . ] tend to have larger @xmath179 due simply to kinematics .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "3 shows that for small @xmath181 the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath30 , while for large @xmath181 it increases . in the latter domain the dominant contribution comes from the back - to - back configuration .",
    "all the qualitative features described above are indeed observed in the available data @xcite for process ( [ eq : a26 ] ) :    * pomeron - pomeron fusion in double - diffractive meson production may act as a glueball filter : the final state is enriched by non-@xmath1 mesons , which have smaller @xmath186 and are produced mainly with tagged protons in the @xmath187 configuration ; * the normal @xmath1 light mesons have larger @xmath186 and their cross sections peak at @xmath188(1270)-meson production in the @xmath189 domain has been observed at higher energies at the isr @xcite . ] ; * the @xmath0 channel is produced mainly in the @xmath166 state @xcite .",
    "these expectations can be confirmed by observing the double - diffractive production of heavier quarkonia , like @xmath190 and @xmath191 , at the tevatron and at rhic .",
    "the heavier mesons sample smaller distances and so their production should be better described by perturbative qcd .",
    "of course , @xmath190 is probably still not heavy enough , but nevertheless it would be interesting to compare @xmath192 production with the enhanced @xmath0 glueball production rate .",
    "it is well known that , in general , absorptive effects in inelastic diffractive processes are much stronger than in the elastic amplitude ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "such rescattering clearly violates regge factorization and leads to non - trivial correlations between the transverse momenta @xmath121 and @xmath122 of the forward going protons in processes of the type @xmath193 .",
    "measuring the @xmath181 and the azimuthal angle @xmath30 distributions can provide an interesting possibility to probe the opacity @xmath194 of the incoming proton and , moreover , to test the dynamics of soft rescattering .",
    "one of the best examples to study these effects is exclusive high-@xmath34 dijet production , @xmath195 , where the cross section for the hard subprocess is large and well known .",
    "although questionable , the above perturbative formalism was applied to central double - diffractive meson production at lower energies , at which data exist .",
    "surprisingly , the qualitative features of these data were reproduced .",
