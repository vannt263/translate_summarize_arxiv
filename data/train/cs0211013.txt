    "parallel discrete event simulations ( pdes ) of asynchronous systems is a computer science term that stands for parallel simulations of complex systems with asynchronous dynamics .",
    "such spatially extended complex interacting systems appear across a wide range of fields in natural sciences , and their examples include interacting spin systems in material physics , activated processes in chemistry , contact processes in stochastic epidemic models , stochastic market models in finance , scheduling call arrivals in communication networks , and routing problems in internet traffic , to mention just a few applications of pdes . despite active research in this area @xcite very few of the pdes techniques have filtered through to the physics community .",
    "even the simplest random - site update monte carlo schemes @xcite , where updates correspond to poisson - random discrete events , were long believed to be inherently serial ( at least in the physics community ) .",
    "simulation studies of parallel computations for asynchronous distributed systems date back more than two decades ago @xcite .",
    "however , it was lubachevsky s work @xcite on parallel simulations of dynamic ising spin systems which shed a new light on this old problem and showed how to efficiently perform conservative simulations on a parallel computer .",
    "the design of efficient algorithms that would allow modeling of asynchronous systems in a parallel processing environment is even more important nowadays , when parallel architectures have become generally available .",
    "the architectures of today may consist of several thousands of processing elements , but the size of future systems may be of the order of hundred thousands @xcite .",
    "such architectures pose new questions of algorithm efficiency and scalability in large scale massively parallel processing .",
    "we address these questions for conservative pdes , using the tools of modern statistical physics , in particular , those of non - equilibrium surface growth @xcite .",
    "the difficulties of parallelizing spatially extended asynchronous cellular automata arise because in asynchronous systems the discrete events are not synchronized by a global clock .",
    "for example , in the basic dynamic ising model for ferromagnets discrete spins with two states each are placed on a lattice .",
    "the discrete events are attempted spin flips , where the spin - flip probability at some site depends on the energy states of the neighboring sites .",
    "the lattice can be partitioned into a number of sub - lattices , and each sub - lattice may be assigned to a different processor . processing elements ( pe ) attempt a number of randomly chosen spin - flips , and communicate with each other in some update attempts ( a discrete event ) .",
    "each pe carries its own local virtual time which is advanced by every update attempt .",
    "the local virtual time on a pe is the simulated time at the spins on its sub - lattice . in the conservative pdes implementation",
    "it is ensured that causality is not violated before each pe makes an update attempt .",
    "alternatively , in an optimistic pdes implementation , pes make updates without communicating with the neighbors , thus sometimes causing causality errors .",
    "the optimistic scheme provides a recovery mechanism by undoing the effects of all events that have been precessed prematurely .",
    "optimistic pdes have been an object of theoretical and simulation studies @xcite .",
    "the development of spatio - temporal correlations and self - organized criticality have been recently studied in the optimistic simulations of the dynamics of ising spin systems @xcite .",
    "the conservative scheme has been used recently to model magnetization switching @xcite , ballistic particle deposition @xcite , and a dynamic phase transition in highly anisotropic thin - film ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "these recent applications suggest that the conservative scheme should be particularly efficient when applied to large systems with short - range interactions .",
    "early efficiency studies of the conservative scheme @xcite do not identify the mechanism which would ensure the scalability of the pdes for an arbitrary system size .",
    "recently , korniss _ et al _ @xcite introduced a new approach that exploits an analogy between the virtual time horizon and a fluctuating surface that grows in a deposition process . in this picture",
    ", the fraction of non - idling pes ( the utilization ) exactly corresponds to the density of local minima in a virtual time surface .",
    "they showed that , in the case of one spin site per pe , the steady state virtual time surface is governed by the edwards - wilkinson hamiltonian , implying that the utilization does not vanish for an infinitely large system of pes . ignoring communication delays and assuming that the utilization is equivalent to the efficiency",
    ", they concluded that the computation phase of short - ranged conservative pdes is asymptotically scalable .",
    "in general , the utilization should not be taken as a sole measure of efficiency in the modeling of asynchronous systems .",
    "the same analysis of a virtual time surface @xcite demonstrated that , in the case of one site per pe , the virtual time horizon infinitely roughens in the infinite pe - limit .",
    "the statistical spread of the virtual time surface severely limits an averaging or measurement phase of pdes , and divergence leads to severe difficulties with data management .",
    "therefore , while the simulation phase ( as determined by the utilization studies ) is asymptotically scalable , the measurement phase is not . to ensure the efficiency of the algorithm",
    ", solutions need to be sought in which both phases of the computation are scalable .    in studies of asynchronous updates in large parallel systems ,",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed a @xmath2-random connection model , where at each time step each pe randomly connects with @xmath2 other pes in the system .",
    "the virtual time horizon for this model is short - range correlated and has a finite width in the infinite pe - limit .",
    "encouraged by this result , we considered the two alternative modifications to the conservative scheme : a random connection model @xcite and the moving window constraint @xcite .",
    "the purpose of these modifications is to ensure that the measurement phase of the conservative pdes is scalable .",
    "this paper presents the results of systematic simulation studies of conservative asynchronous pdes with the moving window constraint ( i.e. , simulation studies of the simulations ) . in section  [ pdes ]",
    "we define terminology and we outline both the basic conservative update scheme and the constraint update rule that we use in modeling of asynchronous pdes .",
    "the scheme that we consider is such that the evolution of the time horizon is decoupled from the underlying systems .",
    "the only one assumption that we make about underlying complex systems is that they are characterized by short - range interactions .",
    "therefore , our analysis is generally valid for a wide spectrum of physics applications .",
    "section  [ scalability ] contains the analysis of scalability issues , which is based on analogies between pdes and kinetic roughening in non - equilibrium surface growth . in the pdes analysis",
    "the focus is placed on two major issues : the scaling of the simulation phase and the scaling of the measurement phase . in section  [ winsec ]",
    "we present and analyze numerical data that were obtained in large scale simulations of an asynchronous conservative pdes scheme with a moving window constraint . in our time evolution studies",
    ", we simultaneously varied the width of the moving window and the system size ( i.e. , the number of processing elements in the system as well as the number of volume elements per processing element ) in search for regularities that would allow general conclusions . in section  [ discuss ] , we discuss connections between the scalability of a constrained conservative scheme and the design of highly efficient algorithms for asynchronous systems .",
    "we consider an ideal system consisting of @xmath0 identical pes , arranged on a ring .",
    "each pe has @xmath3 lattice sites ( or operation volumes ) and the algorithm randomly picks one of the @xmath3 sites . if the site that is picked is an end site communication with a neighboring pe is required , while no communication between pes is required if an interior site is picked . for this system",
    "a discrete event means an update attempt that takes place instantaneously .",
    "the state of the system does not change between update attempts .",
    "processing elements perform operations concurrently , however , update attempts are not synchronized by a global clock .",
    "such a system can represent , for example , concurrent operations of random spin flipping in a large spatially extended ensemble that can be arranged on a regular lattice . in this picture , the ensemble is spatially decomposed into @xmath0 subsystems , each of which carries @xmath3 sites . each subsystem is carried by one pe and the required communication is the exchange of information about states of the border spins . in the simplest case",
    "there is one site per pe , @xmath4 , the system is a closed spin chain , and a spin - flip attempt at the @xmath5-th pe depends on the two nearest - neighbor spins located on the @xmath6-th and the @xmath7-th pes .",
    "the @xmath5-th pe may not perform an update until it receives information from these neighboring pes .    in this conservative pdes scheme , to simulate asynchronous dynamics employing @xmath0 processors , each @xmath5-th pe generates its own local simulated time @xmath8 for the next update attempt .",
    "update attempts are simulated as independent poisson - random processes , in which the @xmath5-th local time increment ( i.e. , the random time interval between two successive attempts ) is exponentially distributed with unit mean .",
    "a processor is allowed to update its local time if it is guaranteed not to violate causality .",
    "otherwise , it remains idle .",
    "the time step @xmath9 is the index of the simultaneously performed update attempt .",
    "it corresponds to an integer wall - clock time with each processor attempting an update at each value of @xmath9 .",
    "short range connections in pdes for a linear chain.,width=302 ]    the simplest choice for a communication rule between processors , which is faithful to the original dynamics of the underlying system , is a short - range connection model ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , where , at any time step @xmath10 , the @xmath5-th pe is allowed to update if its local simulated time @xmath11 is not greater than the local simulated times of its two nearest neighbors : @xmath12 the periodicity condition requires communication between the first and the last pes . in effect , this update rule introduces a nearest neighbor interaction and corresponding correlations between pes , which is analogous with non - equilibrium surface growth .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in the case of @xmath4 the evolution of the virtual time horizon on coarse - grain length scales is governed by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a spatial variable in a continuum limit , the constant @xmath15 is related to the coarse - graining procedure , and @xmath16 accounts for random fluctuations .    in pdes with a moving window constraint ,",
    "the communication pattern between processing elements remains the short - range connection type but the new update rule requires that additionally at each @xmath10-step the local simulated time of the @xmath5-th processor fits within a window of width @xmath1 that is defined relative to the slowest pe ( i.e. , the one with the smallest @xmath17 ) at time @xmath9 .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath5-th pe is allowed the update if @xmath18 simultaneously satisfies the short - range connection condition  ( [ crule ] ) and the following window condition : @xmath19 in the computer science community the minimum in eq.([wrule ] ) is called the global virtual time @xcite . from this definition",
    "it follows that the short - range connection model can be viewed as a particular case of the original update scheme when the width of the window is set to infinity , in which case condition  ( [ wrule ] ) is trivially satisfied for all times .",
    "thus an infinite window is equivalent to the absence of the constraint .    in typical simulations , when the number of volume elements @xmath3 is larger than the minimum @xmath4 , a causality condition  ( [ crule ] ) is enforced only for the border volumes on each pe .",
    "if , at any @xmath9-step , a randomly chosen volume element happens to be from the interior , i.e. , when all of its immediate neighbors reside on one pe , then the pe always executes the update and its local time is incremented for the consecutive update attempt : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath5-th random time increment that is exponentially distributed , randomly chosen independently on each pe and at each parallel step @xmath9 . in the constrained simulations ,",
    "condition  ( [ wrule ] ) is enforced for any randomly chosen volume element .    in the conservative update scheme",
    "a causality requirement is the main mechanism that generates correlations among processing elements . in the absence of a causality requirement local simulated times",
    "would be incremented independently of each other in the fashion of random deposition ( rd ) @xcite .",
    "however , even with this rd update rule , imposing the windowing condition  ( [ wrule ] ) alone will give rise to correlations among processors .",
    "note that the rd update rule does not belong to a class of conservative update schemes i.e. , it can not faithfully simulate the underlying system dynamics . for @xmath1-constrained rd simulations ,",
    "the speed with which the correlations spread among all pes is determined by the width of the @xmath1-window .    for a set of @xmath0 processing elements , a simulated time horizon ( sth )",
    "is defined as a set of @xmath0 local simulated times at a time step @xmath9 . to study the roughening of the sth surface",
    ", we monitor the surface width @xmath22 , which is defined in standard fashion @xcite via the variance of the sth : @xmath23 where the angle bracket denotes an ensemble average and @xmath24 denotes the mean virtual time , @xmath25 .",
    "alternatively , the surface width can also be defined as the absolute standard deviation @xmath26 from the mean virtual local time : @xmath27 we use both definitions  ( [ variance]-[absdev ] ) in our analysis . to study the efficiency of an update process in the system of @xmath0 processors ,",
    "we define the utilization @xmath28 as a fraction of processors that performed an update at parallel time - step @xmath9 . throughout the paper",
    "we consistently use the following notation : the surface width @xmath29 is an ensemble average of @xmath30 computed at @xmath9 , while @xmath31 denotes the corresponding steady - state value at @xmath32 .",
    "the subscript  _",
    "a _ \" denotes the width computed in accordance to  ( [ absdev ] ) , while subscripts  @xmath0 \" or  @xmath3 \" ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) indicate the parameter dependance of the width computed in accordance to  ( [ variance ] ) .",
    "there are two important aspects of scalability , which should be dealt with in studies of algorithm efficiency .",
    "both of them regard the time in the system and connect with data management issues .",
    "the first is the question of whether or not the utilization reaches a constant non - zero value in the limit of large system size ( when @xmath0 and @xmath3 may arbitrarily vary ) . in particular",
    ", one needs to know if the  worst case scenario \" of one volume element per pe can produce a non - zero utilization in the infinite @xmath0-limit .",
    "a zero value of utilization in the infinite system size limit would suggest that an algorithm would likely be useless for computationally intensive tasks on future generations of massively parallel computers , i.e. , on systems that contain hundreds of thousands of processing elements @xcite .",
    "the second question is the behavior of the evolution of the sth , whether or not the statistical spread of the sth saturates in time or scales with the system size .",
    "a negative answer to the latter question would suggest that an algorithm would probably prove impractical in actual applications , because the divergence of the sth width implies that , for most computationally intensive jobs , the data collection and averaging would impose a memory requirement per pe in excess of hardware capacities .    in our scalability studies we exploit existing analogies between the time evolution of the sth and kinetic roughening in non - equilibrium surface growth ; and we use selected results of non - equilibrium surface studies @xcite in analyzing the stochastic behavior of the system under consideration .",
    "the conservative short - range communication scheme between the system components can be regarded as an effective short - range interaction among pes and treated in a similar manner to an interaction among sites of any non - equilibrium surface , growing on a regular lattice .",
    "for these surfaces , the lateral correlation length @xmath34 between sites follows the power law @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the dynamic exponent . for a finite system",
    ", @xmath34 can not grow beyond the system size @xmath0 and it is observed that for times much smaller than a cross - over time @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the surface width increases in accordance to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the growth exponent . for times much larger than the cross - over time , the surface width saturates and scales as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the roughness exponent .",
    "the exponents satisfy the scaling relation : @xmath43 .",
    "the values of the exponents are independent of the details of the system and of the nature of the interactions between sites .",
    "their values can be determined from the corresponding stochastic growth equation , which defines the universality class .",
    "we observed that the simulated time horizon shows kinetic roughening and the typical scaling behavior @xcite : @xmath44 it was demonstrated in @xcite that in the case of one site per pe ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) the time evolution of the sth in the short - range connection model  ( [ crule ] ) follows the kpz equation  ( [ kpz ] ) and direct simulations confirmed that the scaling exponents in eqs .",
    "( [ scale1]-[scale2 ] ) have values consistent with the kpz universality class ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "unconstrained pdes : time evolution of the mean utilization @xmath47 ( averaged over @xmath48 independent random trials ) for various system sizes : @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52.,width=302 ]    as the time index advances the utilization falls from its initial maximal value at @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents the time evolution of the utilization for various system sizes in the basic pdes with short - range connections with the infinite @xmath1-window . for each of the system size",
    ", the utilization attains a steady - state , characterized by a non - zero value in the infinite @xmath9-limit .",
    "this qualitative result is also true for the simulations in two and three dimensions , when an individual pe is allowed to connect with four and six immediate neighbors , respectively @xcite .",
    "such a non - zero steady - state value is characteristic for the kpz universality class and can be expressed by the krug and meakin @xcite relation for generic kpz - like processes : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the utilization in the infinite @xmath0-limit .",

    "this finding demonstrates that the simulation part of the algorithm is scalable in the case of the _",

    "the unconstrained pdes are characterized by an infinite roughening of the sth surface in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] presents a typical time evolution of a surface generated by this basic update scheme for @xmath4 and @xmath62 . as the time index advances",
    ", the surface grows and the statistical spread of its interface increases in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ scale1]-[scale2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the time evolution of the surface width for a few selected system sizes . for a fixed system size",
    "the width follows relations  ( [ scale1]-[scale2 ] ) : after the initial growth phase , the surface saturates and its width reaches the plateau value . by comparing the widths for @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) to those for @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) , one can see that for a fixed @xmath0-number of pes , increasing the number of sites per pe shifts the cross - over time @xmath37 to later values and increases the value of the width at the plateau .",
    "this is expected since a larger value of @xmath3 yields a larger cumulative value for the local time increment between two successive communications with neighboring pes . in the case of @xmath4 , the width of the sth",
    "approaches a finite constant for a finite @xmath0-number of pes ; however this constant diverges in the infinite @xmath0-limit in the power law fashion : @xmath64 which gives the linear divergence of the surface variance for the kpz universality class .",
    "the same holds for the extreme fluctuations above and below the mean simulated time @xcite .",
    "this finding is also valid in the case when each pe carries a block of sites .",
    "the above scaling behavior creates difficulties when intermittent data on each pe have to be stored until all pes reach the simulated time instant at which statistics collection is performed ( e.g. , a simple averaging over the full physical application ) .",
    "the diverging spread of the time horizon implies a diverging storage need for this purpose on every pe .",
    "thus , the diverging width of the sth means that the memory requirement per processing element , for temporary data storage , diverges as the number of processing elements gets arbitrarily large .",
    "therefore , the measurement phase of an algorithm that follows the basic conservative update scheme is asymptotically not scalable . in actual applications ,",
    "the programmer must seek some means of constraining the infinite roughening of the sth or must impose some global synchronization on the system of pes .",
    "unconstrained pdes : time evolution of the time horizon for @xmath62 pes and @xmath4 sites per pe .",
    "the lower surface is a snapshot at @xmath65 , the upper surface is a snapshot at @xmath66 . for @xmath62",
    "the crossover time is @xmath67.,width=302 ]         our and lubachevsky s earlier studies show that to make the conservative scheme efficient , one must use a large number of volume elements @xmath3 .",
    "it is expected that an increase in @xmath3 will modify the growth phase of the sth . in the case of large @xmath3 , the initial growth phase ( for @xmath68 )",
    "should be characterized by @xmath69 , typical for the rd universality class .",
    "then , after the first cross - over time @xmath70 ( for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the saturation time ) the growth should be characterized by @xmath73 , typical for the kpz universality class . in this way , making the simulation phase more efficient ( by increasing @xmath3 ) will speed up the initial growth .",
    "thus , the state savings , which are traditionally associated with optimistic schemes , are disadvantageous in conservative schemes .",
    "a standard way of controlling the growth of the sth is to impose a constraint on its width in the spirit of parallel simulations of asynchronous cellular automata that was proposed by lubachevsky @xcite .",
    "a straightforward application of this idea is the @xmath1-constrained update scheme which demands that at each update attempt a pe can perform an update only if its value of @xmath8 is within the window .",
    "the effect of condition  ( [ wrule ] ) is that fast pes are forced to postpone their updates until slower pes catch up . in the simplified version",
    "studied here , the assigned distance apart is measured in terms of the processor local time that is compared to the global minimum virtual time . since at each @xmath9 the global minimum of",
    "the sth changes its location , so does the window for the update . in this sense",
    "a moving window constraint can be considered as an implicit rule that induces global synchronization , in which each pe connects with the slowest pe . from the implementation point of view",
    ", the most important questions are the scalability issues for realistic systems , where each pe may carry an arbitrary number of sites , because mainly these issues will determine the efficiency of the algorithm in actual applications .      in the @xmath1-constrained pdes ,",
    "simulations reach a steady state for an arbitrary system size in a similar fashion as in the basic short - range connection model , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in general , for any @xmath1-value , when @xmath0 is fixed the steady state value of the utilization gets larger as @xmath3 gets larger ; and , when @xmath3 is fixed it gets smaller as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this behavior reflects the strength of the correlations between pes which arise due to the update rule  ( [ crule ] ) .",
    "namely , for fixed @xmath0 , the frequency of an update per pe increases as @xmath3 increases because condition  ( [ crule ] ) does not need to be verified for the internal sites and the probability of randomly choosing a border site is @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , in this case , correlations that arise due to the short - range connections between pes weaken when @xmath3 is increasing . in the infinite @xmath3-limit these correlations become negligible and the process of incrementing local simulated times resembles random deposition on the _",
    "1-d _ lattice of size @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the rd - limit is equivalent to the infinite @xmath3-limit of pdes .",
    "the mean steady state utilization @xmath75 as a function of the system size is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . when the number @xmath3 of sites per pe is increased the curves converge towards the rd limit . with a narrow @xmath1-window ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) the rd limit is approached fairly quickly ( with @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) , while with a wide @xmath1-window ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) the rd limit is approached more slowly . for an infinite @xmath1-window",
    "the rd limit is @xmath78 , which is the effect of no - correlations in the system in this limiting case .",
    "obviously , @xmath79 when @xmath80 , because in this case only one pe is allowed to make an update .",
    "the rd curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] display the steady state utilization for simulations that are governed only by the update rule  ( [ wrule ] ) alone , i.e. , in the absence of other communications between processing elements .",
    "the fall off in the rd utilization values with an increase in the number of pes , indicates the strength of correlations between pes , which exclusively results from imposing the @xmath1-window constraint .",
    "when all three parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 , are allowed to vary in conservative pdes , the value of the utilization is mostly determined by the width of the moving window .",

    "the lines are guides for the eyes.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in other words , the way in which the system undergoes the transition from the initial state to the steady state , observed in the above example , is a direct consequence of the window constrained update scheme  ( [ wrule ] ) and the particular initial condition , in which all pes enter simulation with their local times equal . if this initial condition of the full synchronization is changed , for example , by assuming that at @xmath53 the local times are randomly distributed about some mean local time , the transition to the steady state will change its character . on the other hand ,",
    "if at some later update attempt @xmath173 the system is synchronized ( which is equivalent to setting all local simulated times to one value at @xmath173 ) then the recurrent time evolution will be repeated after @xmath173 until the steady state is attained .",
    "the above arguments can be restated in terms of the sth variance @xmath150 ( taking eq .",
    "( [ convex1 ] ) as the key to the analysis ) for any system size . in the conservative pdes with a moving window constraint",
    "the system evolution towards a steady state follows essentially one path , along the above outline , for any value of the simulation parameters @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 . in our example",
    "we chose tentatively a very narrow @xmath1-window and a large @xmath3 so the effect of the update scheme  ( [ wrule ] ) is clearly pronounced in the evolution curves .",
    "in such a system , the correlations that arise due to the short - range connection update scheme  ( [ crule ] ) are small relative to the correlations that arise due to the window constraint  ( [ wrule ] ) . accordingly , in this case one can clearly deduce that a sharp fall in the utilization curve is the effect of a sharp population rise in the group of fast pes .",
    "for example , one can read from fig .",
    "[ fig10]b that at @xmath164 about @xmath174 of the pes that did not make an update were mostly in the group of fast pes , so approximately about one half of the fast pes updated at this update attempt .",
    "a similar conclusion is certainly false when each pe in the system carries a small number of sites ( e.g. , @xmath63 ) since in this case the correlations that originate due to the short - range connections between pes may not be neglected and the utilization curve begins the fall at @xmath53 because the fast pes and the slow pes fail to satisfy condition  ( [ crule ] ) with approximately equal frequency .",
    "opening the @xmath1-window wide ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) effects the evolution curves in two ways .",
    "first , it slows down the build - up of the correlations that arise due to constraint  ( [ wrule ] ) .",
    "this makes the growth phase longer so that a transition to the steady state takes place at later times and over extended time intervals .",
    "secondly , it softens the correlations that arise due to constraint  ( [ wrule ] ) , which smooths a transition to the steady state and the ripple - like features in the utilization and the width curves ( that are clear in fig .  [ fig10 ] ) are only weakly present or vanish into statistical uncertainties .",
    "for example , in the worst case scenario of @xmath4 and @xmath95 , the time evolution towards the steady state follows the pattern typical for the kpz universality class ( @xmath139 ) , which suggests that the main correlation mechanism results from the update scheme  ( [ crule ] ) in this case . nonetheless , unlike the kpz surfaces , the presence of the @xmath175-window prohibits the steady - state surface width to grow infinitely as the system gets larger .",
    "our statistical analysis of the growing virtual time interface in conservative asynchronous pdes with a moving window constraint , shows that in the steady state the average utilization remains finite ( and non zero ) and scales with the system size .",
    "similarly , the statistical spread of the sth remains finite and scales with the system size .",
    "this was demonstrated for a range of volume elements from @xmath4 to the rd - limit at @xmath142 .",
    "the convergence of the utilization to a finite value and the convergence of the time interface width to a finite value as the number of processing elements infinitely increases , reflects positively on the ability to efficiently implement this type of pdes in applications .",
    "in other words , with this global @xmath1-window constraint the simulation part as well as the measurement part of the algorithm are simultaneously scalable .",
    "the practical questions that should be addressed involve suitable implementations of the algorithm , possible modifications and generalizations that would facilitate applications by optimizing performance and thus maximizing efficiency . such questions would likely be non - universal , and hence depend on the explicit problem being simulated .",
    "it follows from our analysis that the utilization as defined by a fraction of working processors , is not a sole measure of the efficiency .",
    "however , it is an important component of the efficiency .",
    "the case of pdes with the basic conservative scheme , when the measurement phase is not scalable , suggests other important factors that should be considered in efficiency studies . the second important component is the statistical spread of the virtual time surface as it is measured by its variance or by its mean absolute deviation .",
    "the third important element is the frequency and the effect of extreme fluctuations in the virtual time interface .",
    "the forth important factor is the average progress rate , which could be measured by the growth rate of the global minimum of the virtual time interface .",
    "an efficient algorithm should be characterized by the highest values of the utilization and the progress rate , while having small statistical spread in waiting times and should lack severe effects of the extreme time fluctuations .    applying the above recipe to conservative asynchronous pdes with a @xmath1-window constraint ,",
    "the results of our studies indicate that this kind of simulation presents a promise of becoming a good departure point towards the design of an efficient class of algorithms for asynchronous systems .",
    "the @xmath1-window constraint not only eliminates the extreme fluctuations in the virtual time horizon but also controls the statistical spread of the sth and controls the average progress rate .",
    "the width of the @xmath1-window can serve as a tuning parameter that , for a given volume load per processor , could be adjusted to optimize the utilization so as to maximize the efficiency .    in the conservative asynchronous pdes studied in this work",
    ", there is no condition imposed that would explicitly synchronize a system in the course of the simulations .",
    "the system is fully synchronized only initially and undergoes desynchronization over time ( i.e. , over many parallel steps ) .",
    "the degree of this desynchronization is strictly related to the roughening of the sth .",
    "as the simulations evolve , correlations between system components build up , which is reflected by changes in the morphology of the sth .",
    "there are two sources of correlations in the sth .",
    "the first is the nearest - neighbor communication rule that , if acted alone , would eventually lead to the steady state , where the entire system is correlated . in the case of one volume element per pe ,",
    "the time to the global correlation is on the order of @xmath176 .",
    "however , the presence of this global correlation does not cause an implicit synchronization nor does it lead to a state of near - synchronization . on the contrary , despite this correlation there are no global bounds on the roughening of the virtual time horizon : the larger the system , the more desynchronized it becomes over time .",
    "the nearest - neighbor communication rule is the essence of the conservative scheme because it ensures that causality is not violated in any update .",
    "the second source of correlations is the constraint in the form of the moving window condition . the moving window condition , if acted alone , would lead to the steady state , where the entire system is not only correlated but , also , is synchronized to some extent .",
    "the extent to which the system may become synchronized depends on the width of the moving window  the roughening of the virtual time horizon is constrained to the @xmath1-window width .",
    "notice , the moving window condition is not necessary for the conservative scheme .",
    "its role is to ensure that infinitely large desynchronization will not happen . in this sense",
    "the constraint condition can be seen as an implicit synchronization protocol . in the constrained conservative pdes ,",
    "the above two correlation mechanisms act together : the nearest neighbor connection rule explicitly guarantees causality and the constraint rule implicitly guarantees a near - synchronization in an arbitrarily long sequence of update attempts .",
    "we considered the conservative parallel discrete event simulations with the moving window constraint and studied the time evolution of the utilization as well as the time evolution of the stochastic time horizon by varying the system size ( i.e. , the number @xmath0 of processing elements and the number @xmath3 of sites per processing element ) and by varying the width of the moving window .",
    "the results of our simulations indicate that this particular class of algorithms with the conservative update scheme generally scales with the system size .",
    "the utilization reaches a steady state value after a finite number of simultaneously performed parallel steps and approaches a finite non - zero value in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "this demonstrates that the simulation part of the algorithm is scalable .",
    "the statistical spread of the stochastic time horizon is bounded by the size of the moving window constraint in the limit of the infinite system size , which shows that the measurement part of the algorithm is scalable .",
    "in particular , in the limit of a large number of sites per processing element the results of the simulations approach the constrained random deposition model , which is characterized by a high value of utilization while permitting effective data management .",
    "the simultaneous scalability of both phases of the algorithm is an important finding because it establishes a solid ground for the design of new class of efficient algorithms for parallel processing to model the evolution of spatially extended interacting systems with asynchronous dynamics .",
    "further studies are required in the search for possible optimal implementations .",
    "for example , explicitly taking into account the time required to find the global minimum of the sth at each step .    aside from practical aspects of the constrained parallel conservative discrete event simulations that are oriented to direct applications such as the scalability issues ,",
    "there are several interesting physics questions that arise in connection with the stochastic time surface growth .",
    "these include the development of the lateral correlations and transient relaxation processes .",
