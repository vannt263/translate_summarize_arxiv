    "no direct connection between the unusual superconductivity and the lattice dynamics in the cuprate high-@xmath6 materials has been established to date . by contrast ,",
    "two of the most successful demonstrations of such a connection in bcs materials were reported for nb@xmath7sn ( ref .  ) and for nb ( ref .  ) by neutron inelastic scattering techniques to show that acoustic phonons with energies less than the superconducting gap energy soften and exhibit linewidths that decrease below @xmath6 .",
    "the smaller linewidths correspond to longer phonon lifetimes , and result from the absence of any decay channel available to such phonons in the presence of the superconducting gap which opens up at @xmath6 .",
    "although such behaviour has not been confirmed for the high-@xmath6 cuprate la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) system , low - energy soft phonons have been reported to show interesting correlations with the superconductivity .",
    "firstly , an anomalous lattice hardening below @xmath6 has been observed by ultrasonic measurements  @xcite .",
    "later , it was found that the soft phonon associated with the tilting mode of the cuo@xmath8 octahedra hardens , and that the phonon linewidth saturates below @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    another interesting feature has been studied in the high - temperature - tetragonal ( htt ) phase of lsco with @xmath9 , where kimura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have found that the diffuse scattering appears at incommensurate ( ic ) lattice positions located around the x - points , @xmath10 , as shown by the open circles in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . intriguingly , the incommensurability saturates at the same value as that exhibited by the ic static ( or dynamic ) antiferromagnetic peaks , which suggests that a correlation may exist between the superconductivity , magnetism , and lattice distortion . in this paper , we report the results of neutron scattering experiments performed on a single crystal sample of insulating la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 that were designed to test if the features of the soft phonons and the diffuse scattering mentioned above are in fact related to the superconductivity .",
    "our results bring to light an interesting contrast between superconducting and insulating samples of lsco .",
    "the high - temperature structure of lsco is tetragonal ( space group @xmath13 ) , and it is known that an instability of the zone boundary x - point soft phonon causes a displacive structural transition to the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) phase ( space group @xmath14 )",
    ".  @xcite the left side of fig .",
    "1 depicts the reciprocal lattice of the htt phase ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is structural transition temperature ) , and the lto phase ( @xmath17 ) . due to the twinned structure of the crystal ,",
    "the @xmath18 $ ] axis in the htt phase becomes a superposition of the @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] axes in the lto phase . in the htt phase ,",
    "ic diffuse scattering has been observed for a superconducting @xmath9 sample around the x - points as shown by open circles .",
    "@xcite in the lto phase , superlattice peaks appear at reciprocal lattice points such as ( 014 ) and ( 032 ) , shown by the open squares , which become zone - center @xmath21-points , while positions such as ( 104 ) and ( 302 ) become zone - boundary z - points .",
    "thus the structural transition lifts the degeneracy of the x - point phonon , and two modes can be distinguished in the lto phase , i.e. the @xmath21-point and the z - point phonons , which correspond to the octahedral tilting mode along the orthorhombic @xmath22- and @xmath23-axis , respectively .",
    "the @xmath21- and z - point phonons harden upon cooling below @xmath16 , but then the z - point phonon softens subsequently at lower temperatures , implying an instability against a low - temperature tetragonal ( @xmath24 ) or low - temperature less - orthorhombic ( @xmath25 ) phase .",
    "@xcite in superconducting samples it has been reported that this z - point softening breaks at @xmath6 , suggesting that the superconducting state stabilizes the lto phase .",
    "@xcite    in the present study , z - point phonons were measured at the ( 104 ) and ( 302 ) reciprocal lattice points , respectively , using the spins and bt9 spectrometers located at the nist center for neutron research .",
    "the ( 104 ) z - point phonon was measured using a fixed final neutron energy @xmath26  mev and horizontal beam collimations 32@xmath27 - 80@xmath27-s-80@xmath27-open ( s = sample ) , while the ( 302 ) z - point phonon was measured using a fixed initial neutron energy @xmath28  mev and collimations of 40@xmath27 - 22@xmath27-s-24@xmath27-open .",
    "in addition , x - point phonons were studied at ( 1/2,1/2,4 ) ( tetragonal indexing ) using spins with the same instrument configuration except with a horizontally - focusing analyzer in place of the flat analyzer .",
    "a be filter placed after the sample , and a pg filter placed before the sample , were used to eliminate higher order ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ... ) neutrons for the @xmath26  mev and @xmath28  mev measurements , respectively .",
    "the single crystal of la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 used for the present study was grown in a floating zone furnace ,  @xcite and is the same sample that was used for the neutron scattering measurements of the diagonal ic magnetic peaks .",
    "@xcite lattice constants of the lto phase at room temperature are @xmath31     and @xmath32   , which correspond to reciprocal lattice units of @xmath33  @xmath34 and @xmath35  @xmath34 .",
    "the lattice constant in the htt phase is related to that of the lto phase by @xmath36   , thus @xmath37  @xmath34 .",
    "the structural transition temperature @xmath38  k was determined by monitoring the temperature dependence of the superlattice peak intensity at ( 014 ) , the data for which are shown in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the @xmath39-dependence of @xmath16 accumulated from previous measurements  @xcite shown in fig . 1 ( d ) , where the @xmath3 data point is represented by an open square .    = 3.5 in",
    "representative spectra of the x- and z - point phonons are shown in fig .",
    "2 . while the x - point phonon for @xmath15 is extremely broad in energy , it is nevertheless apparent that the phonon energy decreases on cooling towards @xmath16 .",
    "below @xmath16 , the z - point phonon is well - defined , and its energy and linewidth decrease with decreasing temperature .",
    "profiles taken at several temperatures were fit to an instrumental resolution - convoluted @xmath40 function , @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 represents the phonon energy half - width at half - maximum . the first term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) represents the phonon cross - section , while the second gaussian term describes elastic peak at @xmath45 . from the dispersion relation , the @xmath46-dependent phonon energy @xmath47",
    "is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the phonon energy at either the x- or z - point .",
    "the dispersion constants @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  mev   are taken from ref .  .",
    "fits of the data to the above function are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the solid lines reflect the lorentzian component of the soft phonon as well as the background , while the dashed lines represent the @xmath53 gaussians .",
    "note that the background for the z - point profiles slopes as a result of the analyzer correction factor @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is final neutron wave vector and @xmath56 is the analyzer angle with respect to the scattered beam ) , which must be applied to fixed-@xmath57 scans .",
    "= 3.4 in    the parameters obtained from the fits are summarized in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath44 are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . a general trend is observed on cooling in which the x - point phonon softens towards @xmath16 , and the z - point phonon recovers below @xmath16 and then softens again below @xmath58  k. meanwhile , the linewidth @xmath44 also starts to decrease with decreasing temperature below @xmath59",
    "k. around @xmath16 , the phonon profiles measured at spins ( not shown ) are not well - defined , possibly because they overlap with a @xmath21-point phonon that may not be high enough in energy to resolve from the z - point phonon , and in part because of the strongly damped nature of the soft phonons at high temperatures .",
    "thus we were not able to determine if the phonon softens completely at the structural transition temperature .",
    "= 3.5 in    an enlarged figure of @xmath49 that covers the temperature range @xmath60  k is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) together with the data for @xmath5 reported by lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite the @xmath49 of the insulating @xmath3 sample decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature while the superconducting @xmath5 compound exhibits a softening that breaks at @xmath6 . on the other hand , as shown in the enlarged fig .",
    "4 ( b ) , the linewidth @xmath44 for @xmath3 decreases with temperature and saturates below @xmath61  k , which is similar to the behavior of @xmath44 in superconducting samples , which saturates around @xmath62  k ( ref .  ) .",
    "thus soft phonons show both contrasting and similar behavior in insulating and superconducting samples .",
    "another important contrast between insulating and superconducting materials is found in the diffuse scattering in the htt phase . as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , kimura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported ic diffuse scattering located around the x - point in the htt phase for a superconducting @xmath9 sample .",
    "however , we observe commensurate diffuse scattering for an insulating @xmath3 sample .",
    "figure 5 shows diffuse scattering peaks along the @xmath63 direction for @xmath3 represented by open symbols .",
    "commensurate diffuse scattering grows with decreasing temperature towards @xmath16 , below which it is replaced with a sharp resolution - limited superlattice peak shown by the dashed line in the upper figure .",
    "the lower figure also shows the ic diffuse peaks reported by kimura _",
    "_ for @xmath9 measured at 390  k along the @xmath64 trajectory for comparison .",
    "the @xmath3 data are well - described by fits to a resolution - convoluted two - dimensional lorentzian centered at the commensurate position , as shown by the solid lines with a half - width at half - maximum @xmath65  @xmath34 for 420  k and @xmath66  @xmath34 for 450  k.",
    "we report soft phonon and diffuse scattering measurements on an insulating @xmath3 lsco sample with the goal of elucidating any intrinsic relationship that may exist between the superconductivity and lattice instability exhibited by these materials .",
    "a comparison between the data taken on the present insulating sample and previously reported superconducting samples of lsco reveals some important contrasts .",
    "firstly , there is no break in the softening of the z - point phonon in the insulating sample ( fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ) . this reveals a robust correlation between superconductivity and the structural instability as discussed previously .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the linewidths of the z - point phonon for both insulating ( @xmath3 ) and superconducting ( @xmath67 , 0.12 , and 0.15 ( refs .  ) ) samples saturate at low temperatures .",
    "this suggests that the saturation of the linewidth is not due purely to the superconducting state .",
    "a possible alternative explanation is that the saturated value is determined by impurity scattering from the dopant sr atoms , since the saturated value increases monotonically with @xmath39 .",
    "the hole concentration @xmath39 and saturated value of @xmath68 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath68 is roughly linear with @xmath39 .",
    "briefly , it might be also interesting to consider if there is any significance to the maximum value of @xmath49 of the z - point phonon . needless to say , the temperature where this maximum value is achieved changes with the transition temperature @xmath16 .",
    "however , for both @xmath3 and @xmath69 samples , the z - point phonon starts to soften at the temperature where the linewidth @xmath44 coincidentally starts to decrease , suggesting a general correlation between phonon lifetime and lattice instability .",
    "secondly , the diffuse scattering in the htt phase is commensurate in the insulating sample .",
    "this suggests that the incommensurate nature of the diffuse scattering is characteristic of the superconducting sample , or characteristic near the specific concentration @xmath9 where the ic spin density wave order is well established at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite moreover , the incommensurability of the diffuse scattering increases with temperature and saturates at the same value as that of the magnetic ic modulation .",
    "@xcite in either case , the ic diffuse scattering appears at much higher temperatures than those where the charge localization behavior has been observed by the nqr wipeout effect  @xcite or by conductivity measurements .",
    "@xcite    our current experiment on the @xmath3 sample has established the relation between the incommensurate diffuse peak and the superconductivity . the previous study by kimura _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on samples with @xmath71 can now be interpreted as an explicit signature of an incipient lattice modulation of the hole doped cuprate superconductors that may be related to the inhomogeneous charge and spin state such as the stripes .",
    "it would be interesting in future studies to examine diffuse scattering in @xmath72 , which is just above the superconducting transition , as well as that in optimally doped @xmath5 and overdoped @xmath73 samples .",
