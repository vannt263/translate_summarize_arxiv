    "recent results from longitudinally polarized lepton - nucleon scattering experiments @xcite and , in particular , for single - inclusive pion and jet production in helicity - dependent proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite have started to put significant limits on the amount of gluon polarization in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "this is best quantified in a `` global qcd analysis '' , which treats all available experimental probes simultaneously and consistently at a given order in the strong coupling @xmath1 in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "it allows one to extract the set of universal , spin - dependent parton distribution functions , defined as @xmath2 that yields the optimum theoretical description of the combined data . in ( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) denotes the probability of finding a parton of flavor @xmath5 at a resolution scale @xmath6 with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath7 and helicity @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in a proton with helicity @xmath8 .",
    "our current understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) by taking the first moments of the densities @xmath10 .",
    "these quantities enter the helicity sum rule of the nucleon along with the contributions from the orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "specifically , the total gluon polarization is given by @xmath11 and the challenge is to precisely map the gluon helicity density @xmath12 in a wide range of @xmath7 in order to minimize extrapolation uncertainties in the first moment @xmath13 .",
    "a first global qcd analysis of polarized parton densities @xmath10 at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy was completed recently @xcite .",
    "it was based on the world - data on polarized inclusive and semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering , which are pivotal in constraining the quark and antiquark densities @xcite , as well as on the latest rhic @xmath0 measurements @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the conclusion is that available results from all lepton - nucleon scattering experiments and the rhic spin program are in nice agreement .",
    "this underpins the notion of factorization also for spin - dependent hard scattering processes , which is the foundation for most pqcd calculations and their predictive power .",
    "the polarized gluon density @xmath12 turns out to be compatible with zero in the range of momentum fractions , @xmath14 , accessible to experiments so far .",
    "however , it is still impossible to give a reliable estimate for the total gluon polarization @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a significant contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : firstmom ] ) can still come from the unexplored small @xmath7 region .",
    "hence , the fundamental question of what constitutes the proton spin still remains largely unanswered , despite the fact that impressive progress , both theoretically and experimentally , was made in the past two decades .",
    "back then , it was discovered that only an unexpectedly small fraction , about a quarter , of the proton s spin can be attributed to the intrinsic spin of quarks and antiquarks @xcite .    narrowing down the uncertainties on @xmath12 and , at the same time , extending",
    "the range in @xmath7 continues to be the main objective of experimental efforts in the years to come , utilizing both longitudinally polarized lepton - nucleon and proton - proton scattering . with higher luminosities becoming available at rhic , less inclusive final - states like jet - jet correlations",
    "will be instrumental in achieving this goal as they give a much better handle on the @xmath7 range probed in experiment @xcite .",
    "also , rare probes like prompt photons and heavy quarks come into focus .",
    "both will not be able to compete with single - inclusive pion or jet measurements with respect to statistical precision , but they follow rather different underlying qcd hard scattering dynamics .",
    "therefore , such measurements are crucial for further testing and establishing the universality of helicity - dependent parton densities and hence for our understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon and qcd in general .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of open heavy flavor production in longitudinally polarized @xmath0 collisions at rhic . until vertex detector upgrades are in place , rhic experiments will identify heavy quarks through their semi - leptonic decay electron or muon spectra , which receive contributions from both charm and bottom hadron decays , or by direct reconstructions of hadronic @xmath15 meson decays .",
    "since heavy flavors are a versatile probe of high - density medium effects in nucleus - nucleus collisions , such as modifications of the transverse momentum spectra @xcite , various reference data have been taken at rhic in unpolarized @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "similar measurements are intended with longitudinally polarized protons @xcite .    to reduce the uncertainties from deconvoluting experimental results for decay lepton spectra back to the heavy quark level",
    ", all theoretical calculations should be done as close as possible to the observational level .",
    "this was achieved , e.g. , in a recent phenomenological study of unpolarized charm and bottom production at rhic @xcite . for the simplest example of a single - inclusive electron spectrum from semi - leptonic decays of a heavy meson @xmath16 , the corresponding invariant cross section takes schematically the following form @xmath17 where the symbol @xmath18 denotes a convolution .",
    "the cross section @xmath19 for the production of a heavy quark @xmath20 with mass @xmath21 , energy @xmath22 , and momentum @xmath23 in ( polarized ) @xmath0 collisions can be evaluated within pqcd .",
    "nlo qcd corrections , which are essential for any meaningful , quantitative analysis , are known , both in the unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite case , for quite some time .",
    "we note that the longitudinally polarized hadronic cross section is defined as the combination @xmath24 \\ , , \\label{eq : polxsec - def}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath25 label the helicity states of the colliding hadrons .",
    "the result for @xmath19 depends on the choice of non - perturbative ( helicity - dependent ) parton densities , the value of @xmath21 , and on the unphysical factorization ( @xmath26 ) and renormalization ( @xmath27 ) scales .",
    "the sensitivity of the cross section to variations of @xmath28 can be taken as a rough estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to the truncation of the perturbative series at a certain order .",
    "likewise , variations of @xmath21 contribute to the theoretical ambiguities as well .",
    "we will assess all these sources of uncertainties in our detailed numerical studies .",
    "the other two ingredients to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsec - generic ] ) , are the fragmentation @xmath29 of the heavy quark @xmath20 into a heavy meson @xmath16 and the semi - leptonic decay @xmath30 of @xmath16 into the experimentally observed electrons @xmath31 . since @xmath21 cuts off final - state collinear singularities associated with the heavy quark , its hadronization @xmath29 is fundamentally different from those for light quarks and gluons . in the latter case ,",
    "scale - dependent parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions @xcite have to be introduced by virtue of the factorization theorem .",
    "the non - perturbative transition @xmath32 is described by various phenomenological models for a scale independent function @xmath29 , whose parameters are determined from fits to @xmath33 data @xcite . for our phenomenological studies ,",
    "we use the functional form proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with its single parameter taken in the range given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a fixed order pqcd calculation of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsec - generic ] ) can be supplemented by all - order resummations of quasi - collinear logarithms of the form @xmath34 @xcite , which can be large if the transverse momentum @xmath35 of the produced heavy quark is much larger than its mass . for the time being , we do not pursue similar resummations for the polarized hadroproduction of heavy quarks since @xmath36 for all phenomenologically relevant applications at rhic .",
    "we adopt the parameterization of the semi - leptonic decay spectrum @xmath30 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a fit to babar and cleo data @xcite and used in unpolarized analyses of heavy quark production at rhic @xcite .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsec - generic ] ) can be easily generalized to the important case of heavy quark or decay lepton correlations .",
    "as will be demonstrated in some detail below , such measurements appear to be more promising for accessing the gluon polarization at rhic than single - inclusive decay electron or muon spectra .",
    "to make theoretical calculations for such observables feasible at nlo accuracy , we develop a flexible parton - level monte carlo program to perform all phase - space integrations numerically . for the subtraction of soft and collinear divergences present at intermediate stages ,",
    "we follow closely the methods devised in ref .",
    "@xcite for the computation of heavy flavor correlations in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "our monte carlo code is capable of computing any infrared safe heavy flavor cross section at @xmath37 , including correlations of the @xmath38 pair and control of the accompanying jet , with the same kinematic cuts as used in experiment .",
    "the hadronization of the @xmath38 pair into heavy mesons and their subsequent semi - leptonic decays are modeled as outlined above .",
    "our results complement and significantly extend previous spin - dependent nlo calculations of single - inclusive heavy ( anti)quark yields and of the heavy quark charge asymmetry based on largely analytical methods @xcite , where any information on the partonic recoil system was lost .",
    "the required spin - dependent matrix elements squared at @xmath37 for producing a @xmath38 pair plus a light parton , @xmath39 as well as the virtual corrections to the @xmath40 born cross sections , @xmath41 can be taken from ref .",
    "expressions obtained in @xmath42 dimensional regularization are required only in the singular regions of phase - space , and @xmath43 can be set to zero otherwise .",
    "after appropriate modifications , the results obtained in this work can be used also as the `` resolved '' photon contribution to the spin - dependent photoproduction of heavy quarks at nlo .",
    "a similar parton - level monte carlo program including both direct and resolved photon processes will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "it will allow one to include existing data on spin - dependent charm photoproduction @xcite into future global qcd analyses of polarized parton densities .",

    "we summarize our results in sec .  iv .",
    "we consider heavy quark hadroproduction in longitudinally polarized @xmath0 collisions at @xmath37 in qcd .",
    "all phase - space integrations are performed numerically with monte carlo techniques .",
    "this enables us to compute any observable involving heavy quarks within experimental acceptance cuts , including single - inclusive distributions , correlations among the heavy quark - antiquark pair , and , although not pursued in this work , with the associated hard jet present for the first time at @xmath37 .",
    "this significantly extends available calculations @xcite based on largely analytical integrations over the variables characterizing the partons recoiling from the observed single - inclusive heavy quark or antiquark .    in the integration of the fully exclusive partonic cross sections for the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nlo - proc ] ) and ( [ eq : born - proc ] ) at @xmath37 , one has to deal with ultraviolet , infrared , and collinear divergences , which have to be eliminated before any numerical approach can be used . to this end , we follow closely the subtraction method devised and used in ref .",

    "the subtraction method is based on adding and subtracting counter terms which approximate the real emission processes in ( [ eq : nlo - proc ] ) in the singular regions of phase - space and are integrable with respect to the momentum of an unresolved parton . in this section ,",

    "for further details , we refer the reader to ref .",

    "one can think of @xmath55 as being a set of step functions implementing the experimental cuts imposed on the final - state particles and selecting a certain bin in a histogram .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , charm and bottom quarks are currently detected only indirectly at rhic , mainly through the semi - leptonic decays of the produced heavy @xmath15 and @xmath56 mesons .",
    "thus , the cross section ( [ eq : xsec - fact ] ) at the heavy quark - level is not yet sufficient for comparing theory with experimental results . as indicated in eq .",
