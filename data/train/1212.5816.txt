    "<S> a method to achieve high - brightness self - amplified spontaneous emission ( hb - sase ) in the free electron laser ( fel ) is described . </S>",
    "<S> the method uses repeated non - equal electron beam delays to de - localise the collective fel interaction and break the radiation coherence length dependence on the fel cooperation length . </S>",
    "<S> the method requires no external seeding or photon optics and so is applicable at any wavelength or repetition rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated using linear theory and numerical simulations that the radiation coherence length can be increased by approximately two orders of magnitude over sase with a corresponding increase in spectral brightness . </S>",
    "<S> examples are shown of hb - sase generating transform - limited fel pulses in the soft x - ray and near transform - limited pulses in the hard x - ray . </S>",
    "<S> such pulses may greatly benefit existing applications and may also open up new areas of scientific research .    </S>",
    "<S> in the x - ray region of the spectrum self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) free - electron lasers ( fels ) are currently opening up new frontiers across science @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although sase fels have brightness up to @xmath0 times greater than laboratory sources their full potential is limited by a relatively poor temporal coherence . in this letter , a high brightness sase ( hb - sase ) fel is described which may significantly improve the temporal coherence towards the transform limit , enhancing the spectral brightness and potentially enabling x - ray fels to enhance their existing scientific capability and to access new experimental regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> applications that may benefit include resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) @xcite which requires substantial incident photon flux to collect sufficient spectra with a high enough resolution in energy and momentum in a reasonable time . </S>",
    "<S> rixs has evolved greatly over the last decades , due to increases in photon flux from synchrotron sources then x - ray fels , as well as advances in instrumentation . </S>",
    "<S> each increase in resolution has revealed new details in material excitation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> further improvement may extend study to e.g. single magnons in small exchange systems and the full dispersion curves of superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> new applications made possible by fourier - transform limited x - ray pulses may include time - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of chemical dynamics , or quantitative studies of molecular and cluster fragmentation , where high repetition rate pulses of controlled temporal profile are essential for systematic studies of nonlinear phenomena @xcite .    in the sase fel @xcite , a relativistic bunch of electrons with a lorentz factor of @xmath1 enters an undulator comprising an array of transverse , alternating polarity dipole magnets of period @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the undulator magnetic fields cause the electrons to oscillate transversely and emit initially incoherent radiation . </S>",
    "<S> a cooperative ( or collective ) instability in the coupled electron - radiation system may cause an exponential gain in the radiation field and an electron microbuncing at the resonant radiation wavelength @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rms undulator parameter , proportional to the undulator period and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is a positive feedback process  the electron - radiation coupling drives the radiation phase giving a greater electron microbunching at the resonant wavelength and greater coherent radiation emission  @xcite . in the linear regime </S>",
    "<S> the power growth is given by @xmath5 where the nominal gain length @xmath6 with @xmath7 the dimensionless fel parameter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the process leaves the linear regime and saturates when the electrons become strongly bunched at the radiation wavelength and then begin to de - bunch .    </S>",
    "<S> this type of collective process also describes several other particle - radiation interactions , such as the collective atomic recoil laser  @xcite , collective rayleigh scattering from linear dielectric particles  @xcite or collective scattering from the electron - hole plasma in semiconductors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a significant difference between the fel and these latter interactions is the relativistic speed of the electron bunch as it propagates through the fel . in each undulator period </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 a wavefront at resonant radiation wavelength @xmath8 propagates through the electron beam a distance @xmath8  this is referred to as ` slippage ' . </S>",
    "<S> on propagating through one gain length of the undulator , a wavefront propagates through the electron beam a distance @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this ` cooperation length ' @xmath10 therefore defines the scale at which collective effects evolve throughout the electron beam , and so how the temporal coherence of the radiation field evolves from the initially spontaneous noise . for a sufficiently long electron beam , </S>",
    "<S> different regions along the beam develop from the localised noise source autonomously and are therefore uncorrelated in phase . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the sase process can be considered as a ` localised ' collective process . at saturation the sase output then comprises a series of phase - uncorrelated ` spikes ' which can be shown to be separated by @xmath11  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typically , in the x - ray the electron bunch length @xmath12 , so the output comprises many such spikes and the pulse is far from fourier - transform limited and consequently of reduced spectral brightness from that potentially available .    </S>",
    "<S> several methods may be used to improve the temporal coherence of the sase fel output . </S>",
    "<S> these can be divided into two general classes . in the first class , an externally injected source of good temporal coherence ` seeds ' the fel interaction so </S>",
    "<S> that noise effects are reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this seed field may be either at the resonant radiation wavelength , where available , or at a subharmonic which is then up - converted within the fel . </S>",
    "<S> these methods , which include high gain harmonic generation ( hghg )  @xcite and echo - enabled harmonic generation ( eehg )  @xcite , rely on a synchronised external seed at the appropriate wavelength , pulse energy and repetition rate . in the second class , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence is created by optical manipulation of the fel radiation itself , for example by spectrally filtering the sase emission at an early stage for subsequent re - amplification to saturation in a self - seeding method  @xcite , or via the use of an optical cavity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> methods in this class rely on potentially complex material - dependent optical systems which limit the ease and range of wavelength tuning . </S>",
    "<S> if an optical cavity is used , the electron source repetition rate should also be in the mhz regime to enable a practical cavity length .    the hb - sase method described in this letter </S>",
    "<S> requires no external seeding or photon optics and is thus applicable at any wavelength and repetition rate . </S>",
    "<S> it works by using a series of magnetic chicanes inserted between each section of a long sectional undulator . </S>",
    "<S> the chicanes periodically delay the electron bunch with respect to the co - propagating radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the delays have two main effects . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a radiation wavefront propagates at a rate through the electron beam which can be significantly greater than in sase  the slippage rate is increased . secondly , if the undulator sections are shorter than the gain length @xmath13 , and the chicanes introduce delays which are greater than the cooperation length @xmath10 , then the localised nature of the collective interaction may be broken , so inhibiting the formation of the phase - uncorrelated radiation spikes associated with sase . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - radiation interaction distance over which temporal coherence can be developed therefore becomes much greater than the @xmath11 of sase , and potentially towards the total length that a resonant wavefront propagates through the electron beam to saturation . </S>",
    "<S> this process is aided by the relatively fast rate of change of the radiation phase that can occur in the linear regime  @xcite and which allows the temporal coherence to propagate via a radiation phase which evolves with much greater uniformity than can occur in sase .    an initial study over a limited parameter range  @xcite demonstrated the basic principle of improving the temporal coherence but it is now shown in this letter that by de - localising the collective interaction as described above the coherence length of the radiation may in fact be extended by orders of magnitude with a corresponding enhancement in the spectral brightness . hence the name high - brightness sase ( hb - sase ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential of hb - sase is demonstrated using a fel numerical simulation code that solves the universally scaled one - dimensional fel equations  @xcite @xmath14 in this scaling the independent parameters are the combined interaction distance through the undulator which is scaled by the gain length , @xmath15 , and the distance in the electron beam rest frame which is scaled by the cooperation length , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependent electron - radiation parameters are defined as follows : @xmath17 is the ponderomotive phase of the @xmath18th electron ; @xmath19 is its scaled energy ; @xmath20 is the electron bunching factor for which @xmath21 and is the average over the electrons contained within the ponderomotive well centred at @xmath22 at distance through the interaction region @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the current weight factor where @xmath25 describes the electron pulse current distribution of peak value @xmath26 at the entrance to the fel interaction region ; @xmath27 is the scaled complex radiation field envelope of magnitude approximated by @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the radiation and peak electron beam powers respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the scaled frequency is @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a chicane is to delay the electrons by a longitudinal shift of @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> radiation wavefront propagation in @xmath22 within each undulator section is a constant @xmath34 , so the total relative displacement for the @xmath35th undulator - chicane module is @xmath36 . for equal delays </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath37 , a constant ) the system is identical to that of the mode - coupled fel @xcite , where the frequency spectrum displays discrete sideband modes at spacing @xmath38 and the field in the temporal domain is strongly modulated with period @xmath39 . in hb - sase </S>",
    "<S> however the chicane delays of the @xmath35th undulator - chicane module @xmath40 , are not equal . with an appropriately chosen sequence of unequal delays , </S>",
    "<S> the set of sideband mode frequencies supported by each undulator - chicane module can be made unique . </S>",
    "<S> only those frequencies immediately about the resonant frequency @xmath41 will then receive amplification  </S>",
    "<S> the process may thus be considered as a sequential filtering of unwanted frequencies , or a self - seeding of the growing radiation field .    </S>",
    "<S> the fel equations ( [ tdot],[pdot],[adot ] ) can be linearised using collective variables  @xcite , and solved in the frequency domain via a fourier - laplace transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the solution for the interaction through to the end of the @xmath35th undulator - chicane module is obtained by sequentially applying the linear solution using the output of module @xmath42 as the initial conditions for the @xmath35th module to give : @xmath43 where @xmath44 where @xmath45 are roots of the characteristic equation @xmath46 and a @xmath47 dependence has been assumed on the variables . here </S>",
    "<S> , the electron variables at the end of the @xmath35th undulator section are shifted back in @xmath22 by the chicane using the fourier shift theorem by multiplying them by @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the field variable with @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> the total gain bandwidth envelope of ( [ linear_spectrum ] ) is the single undulator section spectrum , as for the mode coupled case of  @xcite , i.e. it is a sinc function with first zero at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear solution can now be used to optimise a sequence of chicane delays . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the sequence used in the results presented in this letter is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are a series of primes with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , for this sequence , in order for no common modes to exist within the gain bandwidth @xmath58 must be satisfied , and similarly for no common modes within the fwhm bandwidth @xmath59  @xcite , it is necessary for @xmath60 . with some empirical adjustment it may be possible to optimise further this particular delay sequence and circumvent these limits . </S>",
    "<S> other sequences of delays ( for example random variation about a set mean or quasiperiodic @xcite ) have also been shown in simulations to be effective , and can be optimised in a similar way using  ( [ linear_spectrum ] ) .    an estimate from  ( [ linear_spectrum ] ) , valid for @xmath61 and any sequence of chicane delays , shows that the fwhm bandwidth around the resonant frequency @xmath41 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and is thus inversely proportional to the total slippage . using the time bandwidth relation @xmath64 ( in scaled units , @xmath65 ) the _ maximum _ coherence length predicted by the linear theory is @xmath66 .     </S>",

    "<S> also shown is the accumulated total slippage @xmath69.,width=340 ]    hb - sase has been simulated using the above model for a range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a typical example is now shown which demonstrates the large increase in radiation coherence length of hb - sase over normal sase . </S>",
    "<S> the electron beam is long , of scaled length @xmath70 and of constant current , i.e. @xmath71 . the electrons are cold ( no energy spread ) , the scaled undulator section lengths are @xmath61 and a sequence of chicane delays used as above with @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> effects arising from emission at the rear of the electron pulse have been omitted . </S>",

    "<S> for sase , the saturation length is @xmath77 , the coherence length @xmath78 ( close to the sase spike spacing of @xmath79 in units of @xmath22 ) and the rms bandwidth @xmath80 in agreement with sase behaviour  @xcite . for hb - sase </S>",
    "<S> the saturation length is slightly increased to @xmath81 with mean saturated power similar to sase . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coherence length of hb - sase has increased by almost two orders of magnitude to @xmath82 with a bandwidth correspondingly reduced to @xmath83 , to give an increase in spectral brightness of nearly two orders of magnitude over sase . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the sase coherence length @xmath68 , evolves little after the first three gain lengths , reaching half its saturation value by @xmath84 and thereafter growing more slowly than the accumulated slippage @xmath85 , tending asymptotically to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the localised growth of the radiation spikes uncorrelated in phase . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for hb - sase , @xmath68 evolves little for the first three gain lengths , then grows exponentially with a growth rate greater than @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this appears consistent with a more de - localised interaction as discussed above , where initially the coherence takes longer to develop , but then becomes more established as the radiation phase changes rapidly towards a common value over a range approaching the accumulated slippage @xmath85 . </S>",
