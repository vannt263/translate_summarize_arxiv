    "claims of brown dwarf discovery have historically been problematic .",
    "numerous objects have been claimed as brown dwarfs or brown dwarf candidates over the last 15 years , but few have been either generally accepted or subsequently confirmed .",
    "this situation changed  and in spectacular fashion  with the discovery of the brown dwarf gl229b ( @xcite 1995 ) .",
    "here at last was a brown dwarf proto - type so cool , and of such low luminosity , that it quickly became universally accepted .",
    "unfortunately , what gl229b did nt resolve was the status of more massive brown dwarf candidates .",
    "for example , the nature of gd165b  the next best old brown dwarf candidate  remains unclear ( @xcite 1988 ; @xcite 1997a ) .",
    "although its optical spectrum is qualitatively different from that of low - mass stars ( @xcite 1993 ; @xcite 1997 ) , its infrared spectrum is not ( @xcite 1994 ) . and",
    "unfortunately , the closeness of its white dwarf companion makes the detection of li almost impossible .",
    "@xcite ( 1997 ) have found a likely field brown dwarf ( 296a ) , but it is of _ very _ early spectral type ( m5.5 ) , indicating an age of less than 200myr . there is a need for a late proto - type object near the star - to - brown - dwarf transition , but which is _ clearly _ a brown dwarf , against which objects like gd165b can be compared .",
    "we present here observations of just such an object , denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 , discovered in the first @xmath21% of data examined from the deep near infrared southern sky survey ( denis ) .",
    "the denis survey will cover the entire southern sky in three infrared pass bands to 3-@xmath3 limits of i=18.5 , j=16.5 , k@xmath4=13.5 ( @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "such a survey is ideally suited to finding field brown dwarfs . the denis mini - survey project",
    "( @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1997 ) has begun this search by observing brown dwarf candidates from the first @xmath21% ( 230 ) of the initial denis data .",
    "infrared spectroscopy obtained on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) confirmed that at least three of the mini - survey objects were as cool , or cooler than , gd165b ( @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy was obtained with the aat on 1997 june 7 - 9 ( ut ) , using the rgo spectrograph with tek 1k ccd#2 .",
    "observations were made using both a 270r grating in blaze - to - camera mode , providing a resolution of 7  and a wavelength coverage of 64259800 , and a 1200r grating in blaze - to - collimator mode giving a resolution of 1  and a wavelength coverage of 64957030 .",
    "the latter set - up was specifically chosen to permit observation of both the h@xmath5 and lii  6708  lines .",
    "all three denis objects of interest , as well as several very low - mass stars were observed .",
    "the observations are summarised in table 1 .",
    "finding charts for the three denis objects can be found in @xcite ( 1997 ) .",
    "these data were processed using standard techniques within the figaro data reduction package ( @xcite 1993 ) .",

    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure 1 ( the low resolution spectra ) and figure 2 ( the high resolution spectra ) .",
    "perhaps the most instantly noticeable feature of figure 1 is the remarkable similarity between the spectra of the three denis objects and the spectra of gd165b  for so long seen as a singleton object which fits into no classification scheme ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1997 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the spectra in figure 1 have been organised in their apparent order of spectral type ",
    "latest towards the top .",
    "because of the strength of terrestrial h@xmath8o , the spectra are not plotted beyond 9150 .",
    "the spectral types shown for vb10 , bri0021 - 0214 and gd165b are due to kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1997 )  the other types are our estimates .",
    "prominent in the spectra are the lines of cs i at 8521  and 8943 .",
    "these lines were pointed out in the spectra of very low - mass stars by @xcite ( 1997 ) , at equivalent widths ( ew ) of 0.5 - 1 . in the latest of the denis objects ( denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 and denis - pj0205.4 - 1159 )",
    "they are present at a whopping ew=6.5 . also strong are lines of rb  i at 7800  and 7943  ( @xcite 1995 ; @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly the lines of na  i and k  i , so prominent in late m - dwarfs , seem to become progressively weaker beyond m10 .    however , the strongest feature of figure 1 is the almost counter - intuitive weakening of the tio and vo molecular bands with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is primarily due to the formation of dust , which plays an important role in these very late atmospheres .",
    "this is both because of its influence on opacities ( eg . models require opacity due to dust to match the spectral energy distribution of gd165b ",
    "@xcite 1996 ) _ and _ composition ( eg . the formation of perovskite , catio@xmath9 , will deplete atmospheres at @xmath2 1600k of their tio , causing these bands to vanish  @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1997a ) .",
    "notice in particular the bands near 8500  which are weakly present in gd165b , but have vanished at the temperatures of denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 and denis - pj0205.4 - 1159 .",
    "the spectra confirm the result of @xcite ( 1997 )  these three objects have effective temperatures similar to , or cooler than , gd165b . like gd165b , the three denis",
    "objects all show weak , or non - existent , tio and vo bands , as well as strong lines of cs i ( @xcite 1997b ) .",
    "in fact , apart from being very red , their spectra look almost nothing like those of late m dwarfs .",
    "this supports the suggestion of @xcite ( 1997a ) that an entirely new spectral type is required for this class of objects  based on features like the absence of tio and vo , and the strength of cs  i.      figure 2 shows the high resolution spectra obtained for denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 and denis - pj1058.7 - 1548 , as well as a comparison spectrum of bri0021 - 0214 , which is known to have depleted its lithium ( @xcite 1995 ) .",
    "denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 shows a clear li absorption feature with ew=2.30@xmath00.05 .",
    "( the quoted uncertainty is based on photon - counting errors , and does not include the systematic uncertainty in the `` pseudo '' equivalent width . ) despite the fact that denis - pj1058.7 - 1548 was observed for only 2 hours ( as compared to 5 hours for denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 ) it clearly _ does not _ show a li absorption of a similar strength .",
    "we place a 3@xmath10 upper limit on this object of ew@xmath110.5 .",
    "interpretation of these equivalent widths as li abundances is made problematic by the lack of published model atmospheres at the required spectral resolution and temperatures .",
    "however , based on the models and curves of growth of @xcite ( 1995 ) which extend to 2000k , we crudely estimate [ li / h ] = @xmath2 13 .",
    "@xcite ( 1997 ) estimate absolute magnitudes for denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 and denis - pj1058.7 - 1548 of m@xmath12 = 12.1@xmath00.4 and 11.4@xmath00.4 ( respectively ) .",
    "these seem to be confirmed by the fig",
    ". 1 spectra , which show denis - pj1058.7 - 1548 being of earlier type than gd165b ( m@xmath12 = 11.7@xmath00.2 ; @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1993 ) , and denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 being of later type .",
    "bolometric corrections have been estimated for only one object at these temperatures ( gd165b , @xcite 1993 ) , however the unceratinties in bc@xmath13 are , in any case , considerably smaller than those in m@xmath12 .",
    "we derive m@xmath14 = 15.4@xmath00.5 and 14.7@xmath00.5 , or log(l/)=@xmath64.3 and @xmath64.0 . at log(l/ ) = @xmath64.3 , the presence of _ any lithium at all _ in denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 constrains the mass to be less than 0.065 , and the age to be @xmath15gyr ( @xcite 1993 ) .",
    "it is clearly a _ bona fide _ brown dwarf  it can not be a more massive object which has not yet depleted its lithium , since it is more than 10 times fainter than models at the required age ( @xmath2 100myr ) .",
    "conversely , denis - pj1058.7 - 1548 must be more massive than 0.065 .",
    "recently , an improved understanding of convection in cool atmospheres has found that for t@xmath16k , the central convection zone does _ not _ reach into the photosphere ( @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "this lead allard to suggest that the `` li test '' is inappropriate for m10 dwarfs and later .",
    "while this is true , objects more massive than 0.05  will spend at least @xmath173@xmath1810@xmath19yr at t@xmath20@xmath212300k ( @xcite 1996 ; @xcite 1993 ) , during which time their li will be depleted if central temperatures are high enough ( ie if their mass is @xmath220.065 ) , and will not be depleted if their mass is @xmath230.065 . for objects less massive than 0.05",
    "the presence of li will reflect both the initial li abundance , and the timescale at which the convective interior drops below the photosphere . in either case , the presence of li in denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 must imply a brown dwarf nature , since li would have been totally depleted in an object with its luminosity were it more massive than 0.065 .",
    "interestingly , only one of the denis objects reported here shows evidence for h@xmath5 emission  and that is very weak .",
    "our high resolution spectra show h@xmath5 emission with ew=1.3@xmath00.4  in denis - pj1058.7 - 1548 .",
    "we place 3-@xmath3 upper limits on emission in denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 and denis - pj0205.4 - 1159 of 1.0  and 3.5 , respectively .",
    "the level of emission in these , presumably old , dwarfs is significantly less than that seen in the pleiades brown dwarfs ( age @xmath2 100myr , ew@xmath175 @xcite 1996 ) . in particular",
    ", this implies that denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 probably has an age @xmath24myr .",
    "given its luminosity , this imposes a lower mass limit of about 0.02(@xcite 1993 ) .",
    "we also detect h@xmath5 emission at a level of 1.30@xmath00.05  in bri0021 - 0214 , in which h@xmath5 had not previously been detected ( @xcite 1996 ) .",
    "this clearly indicates that chromospheric activity _ is _ present in this star , though at a low level .",
    "finally a brown dwarf has been discovered , just below the brown dwarf limit , conclusively showing us what a brown dwarf of @xmath250.065  looks like .",
    "the similarity of the optical and infrared spectra of denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 to that of gd165b , and the other two denis objects presented here , suggests that they too probably lie below the brown dwarf limit .",
    "in fact , the available data point to denis - pj0205.4 - 1159 being _ cooler _ than denis - pj1228.2 - 1547  li observations of this object will be made a high priority .",
    "lastly , it is worth emphasising that these three dwarfs were discovered in just the first @xmath21% of the denis data  many more exciting results can be expected in the future as this survey continues .",
    "we are grateful to davy kirkpatrick for discussions on his unpublished gd165b data and for a thorough referee s report , and to ben oppenheimer for helpful discussions about his unpublished gl229b data .",
    "we are also extremely grateful to the aao director , brian boyle , for providing the discretionary time in which these observations were carried out .",
    "cgt would personally like to thank nicolas epchtein and the members of the denis team for providing access to denis data prior to its general release .",
    "the denis project is partly funded by the european commission through the _ science _ and _ hcm _ grants .",
    "it is also supported , in france by insu , the education minsitry and cnrs ; in germany by the land of baden - wrtenburg ; in spain by dgicyt ; in italy by cnr ; in austria by the ffwf and bwf ; in brazil by fapesp ; and in hungary by an otka grant .",
