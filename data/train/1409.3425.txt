    "<S> in an atomic , cancellative , commutative monoid @xmath0 , the elasticity of an element provides a coarse measure of its non - unique factorizations by comparing the largest and smallest values in its set of factorization lengths ( called its length set ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the set of length sets @xmath1 for any arithmetical numerical monoid @xmath0 can be completely recovered from its set of elasticities @xmath2 ; therefore , @xmath2 is as strong a factorization invariant as @xmath1 in this setting . for general numerical monoids , </S>",
    "<S> we describe the set of elasticities as a specific collection of monotone increasing sequences with a common limit point of @xmath3 . </S>"
