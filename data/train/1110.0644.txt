    "<S> in the context of the sensational results concerning superluminal velocities , announced recently by the opera collaboration , we have proposed a classical model yielding a statistically calculated measured velocity of a beam , higher than the velocity of the particles constituting the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the two key elements of our model , necessary and sufficient to obtain this curious result , are a time - dependent `` transmission '' function and statistical method of the maximum - likelihood estimation .    opera neutrino anomaly , superluminal neutrinos 06.30.gv velocity , acceleration , and rotation , 06.20.dk  measurement and error theory , 07.05.kf  data analysis : algorithms and implementation ; data management , 13.15.+g  neutrino interactions , 14.60.lm  ordinary neutrinos , 03.30.+p  special relativity    inspired by the amazing results of the opera collaboration @xcite , claiming that the velocity of light @xmath0 has been beaten by a beam of neutrinos , we propose a simple classical model , which yields the curious effect of a seeming increase of `` effective '' velocity ( see @xcite , for an earlier independent approach , and also @xcite , for a wave version ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are dozens of papers , which have recently appeared , adopting various attitudes towards the results presented by the opera collaboration , for example @xcite ( see also an example of an older work on superluminal velocities @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the attitude of our paper is definitely skeptical . in view of the fact that we have found a ( `` mathematical '' ) model providing an `` artificial '' increase of real velocity , we are forced to put the results announced by the opera collaboration in doubt . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have also proposed a simple working example , such that appropriately fitting its parameters one can simulate the controversial results of the opera collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , our paper does not indisputably invalidates the conclusions drawn by the opera collaboration , but it seriously weakens their argumentation , indicating a logical gap in their reasoning .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is purely classical and dynamics free . </S>",
    "<S> no new physics , nor quantum mechanics , nor even ( classical ) wave mechanics is involved . </S>",
    "<S> only standard classical kinematics notions as well as the statistical method of the maximum - likelihood estimation ( mle ) are used in our approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions of our model are the following . </S>",
    "<S> a spatially homogeneous , lasting the period @xmath1 , beam of classical particles ( `` extraction '' ) moving with a constant speed @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) travels from a source to a detector . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the source and the detector is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density function ( pdf ) of the time of emission of the particles within the duration @xmath1 of production of the beam is given by the function @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in an ideal situation ( none of the particles is lost ) we would obtain , according to classical kinematics , the measured data waveform @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> now , let as suppose that the fraction of the particles emitted , measured by the detector , due to some physical mechanism , is given by the ( non - negative ) `` transmission '' function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of the particles emitted at the time instant @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the number of the particles detected , which have been sent at the same time instant @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , in general , not all particles emitted are detected ( @xmath13 )  obvious , and moreover @xmath14  conceivable . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we will assume that the numbers of the particles , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are so large that we are allowed to use a continuous approximation . </S>",
    "<S> then , the transmission function @xmath17 is a ( continuous ) function satisfying the condition @xmath18 .    to be able to draw conclusions from experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we should implement some statistical methodology . </S>",
    "<S> to be so precise as possible , in our approach , we adopt the method of the mle , as the opera collaboration has done @xcite . in the framework of the mle </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the likelihood function @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithm @xmath20 of @xmath19 is given by the formula @xmath21\\equiv\\sum_{j}\\log\\left[w(t_{j}+\\delta t)\\right],\\label{eq : genlikelihood}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are the time instants corresponding to the measurement events at the detector , and the time deviation @xmath23 we are interested in ( see @xcite , for details ) provides the maximum of @xmath20 ( and also of @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the numbers of the measured events @xmath22 are large , in our continuous approach , instead of summation in ( [ eq : genlikelihood ] ) , we should use integration with an appropriate integration measure @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents the time distribution of the experimental events detected by the opera . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath25 is determined by product of two factors . </S>",
    "<S> the first factor , @xmath26 , is proportional to the number of the particles sent , i.e. @xmath27 , and the second one is proportional to the transmission function @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath28    finally , @xmath29f(t)w(t)dt.\\label{eq : conlikelihood}\\ ] ]    to demonstrate that our idea actually works , we propose a specific example . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the example are so fitted that it yields the time deviation @xmath30 ( for comparison , the opera result is @xmath31 ) . for calculational simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we assume the gaussian form of the pdf ( see the solid line in fig.[fig:2curves ] ) , @xmath32 as well as the gaussian form of of the transmission function , @xmath33,\\label{eq : nontrivialtransmission}\\ ] ] where the one tenth in front of the exponent is reminiscent of `` @xmath34 variation '' in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time distribution of the `` detected experimental data '' @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath5 of the form ( [ eq : gauss ] ) and to the transmission function @xmath17 of the form ( [ eq : nontrivialtransmission ] ) is presented in fig.[fig:2curves ] by the dashed curve .    ]    in this ( doubly ) gaussian case it is even possible to solve the problem analytically ( see appendix ) , but for our purposes a numerical value will do . </S>",
    "<S> it appears , that the maximum of ( [ eq : conlikelihood ] ) is attained for the time deviation @xmath35 where s.d .  </S>",
    "<S> means the standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily translate the dimensionless ( [ eq : numdelt ] ) into a dimensionfull entity . in the opera experiment @xmath36 , whereas in our example we can reasonably assume , for definiteness , that @xmath1 equals ( in dimensionless units , or in the units of the standard deviation ) twice the two standard deviations , i.e.   @xmath37 ( see two vertical intervals in fig.[fig:2curves ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the dimensionfull time deviation corresponding to ( [ eq : numdelt ] ) is @xmath38    in particular , our analysis confirms the findings of @xcite that the time deviation @xmath23 is independent of the distance @xmath4 , but depends on the shape of the beam . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the numerical coincidence ( [ eq : unitdelt ] ) has only an illustrative purpose . </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero time deviation @xmath23 directly implies a modified velocity @xmath39 according to the elementary formula @xmath40 in our model the sign of @xmath23 ( positive in our example ) depends on details of the form of the transmission function @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , reversing the sign in front of the exponent in ( [ eq : nontrivialtransmission ] ) reverses the sign of @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that our specific example is not supposed to mimic a real situation in the opera experiment , but only to demonstrate that it is , in principle , possible to easily come to its conclusions without any reference to superluminal particles and/or some exotic phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> any considerations concerning a possible physical mechanism governing the time - dependence of the `` transmission '' function @xmath17 are outside the scope of our paper . </S>",
    "<S> we can only speculate that @xmath14 could be a property of the source , or of the detector or it could follow from interactions in the earth s crust . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , measurement errors , always encountered in real experiments , do not enter our considerations as they have nothing to do with the discussed effect .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to intuitively explain the non - zero value of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , deforming the shape of the pdf @xmath5 with an appropriate ( time asymmetric ) transmission function @xmath17 shifts a portion ( its `` upper '' part ) of the `` waveform '' @xmath5 forward or backward , yielding positive or negative @xmath23 , respectively , which is next erroneously interpreted by the method of the mle as a `` real '' time deviation . in a sense , </S>",
    "<S> our approach is a `` corpuscular '' analog of the well - known situation of `` superluminal '' velocity of light in material media @xcite , where to some extent , the role of @xmath17 plays dispersion .    in conclusion , we would like to emphasize that there are two elements of our model , responsible for the curious effect of the superluminal velocity : the time - dependent transmission function @xmath17 , which should `` favor '' leading edges and `` disfavor '' trailing edges of the beam , and statistical methodology , erroneously assuming the method of the mle . </S>",
    "<S> this is why it is conceivable that the paradoxical results of the opera collaboration could be possibly avoided upon another approach , e.g.  an approach giving preference to the front velocity or to another statistical method . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no superluminal particles are necessary to explain the `` superluminal '' velocities derived by the opera collaboration . moreover , independently of the further fate of the conclusions drawn by the opera collaboration ( acceptance or refutation ) , we have demonstrated that standard statistical methods , e.g.  mle , should be used with great care , as they can provide erroneous output . therefore , the results of our paper do not rely on the final solution of the opera paradox . </S>"
