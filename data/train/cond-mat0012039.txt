    "interference effects , arising from the interplay of phases accumulated along different paths , are particularly interesting in ballistic chaotic systems .",
    "it is due to the hierarchy of importance among the classical trajectories in these systems : long trajectories exhibit a universal statistical behavior , while short ones constitute the dynamical fingerprints of the system .",
    "the stable ( and therefore usually also the shorter ) the orbit is the stronger is its signature .",
    "this signature appears both in the wave functions ( the scar phenomenon@xcite ) as well as in the statistical properties of the energy spectrum of the system@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the fingerprints of the classical periodic orbits on the nature of interference in chaotic systems .",
    "our best understanding of quantum interference is in disordered systems . in these systems interference",
    "may lead to localization of the particle in space@xcite .",
    "if , however , the disorder is too weak to localize the particle , interference manifest itself as an increase in the return probability compared to the classical value .",
    "this effect , known as weak localization ( wl ) , has been observed by measuring the magnetoresistance of metallic films@xcite .",
    "recent advances in nanostructure technology@xcite , opened the possibility of manufacturing clean mesoscopic systems  systems in which the elastic mean free path , @xmath2 , is of order of the size of the system , @xmath3 .",
    "it is natural to ask what is the analogue of wl in such ballistic systems ?",
    "very little is known about this issue , mainly because of the failure of periodic orbit theory to provide a simple systematic procedure for calculating interference ( i.e.  wl ) corrections@xcite .",
    "this failure has been one of the main motivations for constructing the supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath4-model of ballistic systems@xcite .",
    "the hope was that this model will produce a wl expansion for ballistic systems analogous to that of disordered systems .",
    "however , it turned out that wl crucially depends on the regularization of the field integral , and only specific cases could be worked out@xcite .",
    "these are the cases where the dynamics is still diffusive or dictated by random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite .",
    "usually one would choose to study the wl signature in transport properties , because they are naturally related to the experimental data .",
    "however , this choice will be inappropriate for our purpose for the following reason : wl ( similar to localization ) takes place on a certain manifold in phase space .",
    "for example , in disordered systems this manifold is the real space , while in a circular billiard with rough boundaries localization occurs in the angular momentum space@xcite . in general chaotic systems",
    "there is no preferred basis , therefore , wl may appear on a complicated manifold in the phase space@xcite .",
    "yet , transport measurements dictate a preferred basis , and may totally miss the wl physics we seek to describe .    nevertheless , interference effects manifest themselves also in the spectral properties of chaotic systems , which are independent of the choice of basis . therefore , in this work we shall focus our attention on the wl contribution to the simplest nontrivial spectral quantity  the two - level correlation function : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the density of states , @xmath7 is the mean spacing between neighboring energy levels , @xmath8 , and the averaging , @xmath9 , is over the disorder configurations or the energy @xmath10 .    to state our problem in this context , consider the density of states of quantum system with hamiltonian having a classical chaotic counterpart .",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite expresses the density of states , in the semiclassical limit , as a sum over the classical periodic orbits of the system : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the action of the @xmath13-th periodic orbit , and @xmath14 is the corresponding amplitude depending on the stability of the orbit and its period @xcite .",
    "the traditional way of calculating correlators such as ( [ rw ] ) , within periodic orbit theory , is to use the so called diagonal approximation @xcite . in this approximation one",
    "= 5.33 cm    replaces a double sum over periodic orbits ( such as that obtained when substituting ( [ gutz ] ) in ( [ rw ] ) ) by a single sum : @xmath15 }    \\right\\rangle   \\to \\frac{2}{\\beta }    \\sum_p |a_p|^2 e^{i\\omega \\tau_p } , \\label{diagonalaprox1 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the period of the @xmath13-th orbit .",
    "the rational behind the diagonal approximation is that the coherent contributions , at @xmath17 , come from pairs of orbits @xmath18 having precisely the same action .",
    "thus one should pair orbits with themselves , @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diaorbits]a ) , as well as with other orbits related by symmetries such as time reversal symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diaorbits]b ) . in the absence of other spatial symmetries ,",
    "@xmath20 in the above formula is one for systems with time reversal symmetry , and two for systems which do not have this symmetry .",
    "the problem of wl in the context of the two - level correlation function can be formulated as : _ how can one improve on the diagonal approximation to include interference effects systematically ? _    in seeking for the solution of this problem it is natural to inquire about the situation in disordered systems where the systematic interference corrections to the diagonal approximation is the `` weak localization '' expansion .",
    "the diagrammatic picture of the wl correction to @xmath0 suggests that the wl contribution is associated with pairs of periodic orbits crossing themselves at some point in space as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diaorbits]c@xcite .",
    "thus along one loop the two orbits propagate in the same direction , while along the other loop they are in opposite directions .",
    "however , such orbits exist only in the presence of a non - classical scattering potential , and do not have a direct analog in the periodic orbit theory .    facing this difficulty , in this work",
    ", we study wl using disorder diagrammatics but far from the diffusive regime , i.e. when the elastic mean free path is of order of the size of the system . in this case , the disorder is sufficiently weak , and traces of the short periodic orbits of the underlying clean system are still significant .",
    "we , thus , consider a system consisting of a particle confined to move on a two dimensional torus , in the landscape of a random potential , see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "the hamiltonian    = 5.33 cm    of the system is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the momentum of the particle , @xmath23 is its mass , and @xmath24 is a gaussian random potential defined by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the averaged density of states per unit area , and @xmath27 is the elastic mean free time for scattering on the potential .",
    "this system has been considered earlier by altland and gefen  @xcite and by agam and fishman  @xcite , but only in the framework of the diagonal approximation .    in analyzing the results of the above model",
    ", it will be convenient to use the spectral structure factor defined as @xmath28 using @xmath1 one can relate the quantum spectral properties of the system to the behavior of its classical analog . in particular , @xmath1 form a connection to the periodic orbits of the system : substituting ( [ diagonalaprox1 ] ) in ( [ eq : sdef ] ) one sees that , within the diagonal approximation , the structure factor takes the form of a sum over peaks located at times which equal to the periods of the classical periodic orbits : @xmath29 it has been noticed by argaman et al.@xcite that the right hand side of the above equation can be also interpreted as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the classical return probability at time @xmath32 .",
    "the notion of return probability has been further developed by chalker et al .  to obtain a more accurate description of the structure factor for diffusive electrons@xcite .",
    "a disorder potential usually erases the @xmath33-singularities of @xmath1 associated with the classical orbits of the clean system .",
    "but , if it is sufficiently weak , it will leave traces of the them .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 calculated , in the diagonal approximation , for weak disorder , shows a series of peaks  @xcite ( see inset of fig .  3 ) .",
    "the locations of these peaks    = 7.33 cm    along the time axis are precisely the periods of the orbits of the clean system .",
    "( these orbits are defined by pairs of winding numbers which count the times the trajectory winds around the torus in each direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : w.n ] . )    in view of the behavior shown in fig .  3 and the results of disorder diagrammatics",
    ", one may naively speculate that the wl contribution to the structure factor adds up in a similar way .",
    "namely it consists of a series of singularities located at periods of the eight - shaped orbits illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diaorbits]c",
    ". one may also expect this contribution to be positive , as in diffusive systems , since it should reflect an increase in the return probability compared to the classical value ( i.e.  the diagonal approximation ) .",
    "however , as we show here , this picture is inaccurate . indeed , in the ballistic regime",
    ", some singularities do appear at times which can be interpreted as periods of eight - shaped orbits ( fig .",
    "but these contributions are rather weak . a large _ negative _ contribution comes from the original periodic orbits .",
    "it is superimposed on a smooth positive background which is not related to properties of the clean system . at certain cases",
    "the wl contribution to the structure factor can even become altogether negative .",
    "thus , in ballistic systems , it does not have , necessarily , a definite sign .    to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we organized it as follows : in the next section we prepare the mathematical background for our derivation by reviewing the standard results of disorder diagrammatics in the diffusive limit . this way we set the basis for extending the diagrammatic approach to the ballistic regime . in section iii",
    "we    = 7.33 cm    derive our central formulae for the wl contribution to @xmath0 , and the structure factor , @xmath1 . in section iv",
    ", we analyze these results and derive an asymptotic expression for @xmath1 . finally , we summarize and present our conclusions in section v.",
    "the purpose of this section is to lay the technical background , and set the nomenclature for the analysis which will be carried out in the forthcoming sections .",
    "we shall review the main ideas of disorder diagrammatic technique for diffusive systems@xcite , present the basic building blocks , discuss the approximations involved , and the limits of applicability .",
    "finally , we summarize the results for the wl contribution to @xmath0 within rmt framework , and for diffusive systems .",
    "these results will form a reference point for the analysis of @xmath0 in the ballistic limit , which will be carried out in the next section .",
    "the disorder diagrammatic approach for hamiltonians of the type ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is an efficient way of constructing the perturbation expansion , in the weak potential @xmath24 , for quantities averaged over the disorder configurations .",
    "examples of such quantities are @xmath34-point spectral correlation functions , the magnetic susceptibility , and various properties of the conductance of disordered metals .",
    "this diagrammatic approach is a semiclassical approximation in which the ratio of the particle wave length , @xmath35 , to the elastic mean free path , @xmath2 , is assumed to be small .",
    "therefore , it takes the formal form of an asymptotic series in powers of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fermi wavenumber . yet , usually there will be also non - perturbative contributions , which are important when trying to resolve features on the scale of the mean level spacing , @xmath38 , or over time scales longer than the heisenberg time @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the applicability range of disorder diagrammatic is also limited to times smaller than the heisenberg time , and energies larger than the mean level spacing .    as a first example , consider the average of the retarded green function :    = 8.33 cm    @xmath40 here @xmath9 denotes an averaging over the configurations of the disordered potential , @xmath41 is an infinitesimal positive number , and @xmath22 is the particle momentum . expanding the green function in powers of @xmath24 , and changing representation to momentum space yields @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fourier transform of the potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) , and @xmath44 is the free green function .",
    "terms containing an odd number of @xmath45-s vanish upon averaging , while those having an even number are calculated by wick s theorem ( since the potential @xmath45 is gaussian ) .",
    "thus the average is equal to the product of averages of all possible pairs , such as @xmath46 .",
    "the various terms of this expansion can be represented diagrammatically as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dressed ] .    a partial summation of the infinite series of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : dressed ] , is achieved using dyson s equation , and summation over the irreducible diagrams ( those which can not be separated into two disconnected diagrams by cutting one internal propagator line , e.g. ( b ) ( d ) and ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dressed ] ) .",
    "thus the averaged green function satisfies the relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the self energy given by the sum over all irreducible diagrams , see fig .",

    "similarly , the average of the advanced green function is given by @xmath54 .",
    "consider , next , the probability of a particle to arrive to @xmath55 in time @xmath32 , when its initial state , @xmath56 , is a wave packet localized near @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that this wave packet is composed of eigenstates centered at the fermi energy , @xmath58 , and ranging over an energy band of width @xmath59 . in the semiclassical limit @xmath60 ,",

    "the use of the van - vleck propagator for a system with a white noise potential is unjustified , since the scattering is not semiclassical .",

    "it is approximately the traversal time across the system , @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the velocity of the particle , and @xmath3 is the size of the system .",
    "therefore , from now on we define @xmath117 to be @xmath179    in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] we plot @xmath180 , for various values of the ratio between the elastic mean free path and the size of the system .",
    "these values range from diffusive ( @xmath181 ) to ballistic ( @xmath182 ) dynamics .",
    "several features of @xmath174 are evident : first , the wl contribution appears only within a finite interval of time .",
    "it vanishes both at @xmath183 and when @xmath184 .",
    "second , in both limits , @xmath172 and @xmath185 , the wl contribution becomes strong .",
    "third ,    = 7.33 cm    in the ballistic regime , @xmath173 , @xmath174 exhibits a distinctive singular behavior consisting of a series of dips .",
    "these dips are located at times which are combinations of periods of the periodic orbits of the clean system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultswnum ] we depict @xmath174 for @xmath186 and indicate the singularities with the corresponding combinations of periodic orbits .",
    "in analyzing the above results it is instructive to study , first , the convergence behavior of the momenta sum of the wl contribution . in fig .  [",
    "fig : exactdigrams1 ] we depict the results for @xmath174 calculated in the following approximations : the dash - dotted line is the contribution coming from the zero mode , @xmath187 .",
    "clearly this mode dictates the gross behavior of @xmath174 .",
    "in particular , it determines the interval of time where wl is significant . the dashed line is the result obtained by taking into account the next lowest momentum modes , i.e. summing over @xmath164 and @xmath165 within the radius @xmath188 . in this approximation",
    "some additional features of @xmath174 are resolved .",
    "the solid line is the result of the full momenta sum .",
    "thus the singular behavior of the structure factor comes from the tail of the sum .    to obtain a simple analytic characterization of the wl contribution to the structure factor",
    ", we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , we derive a formula for the smooth part of @xmath174 given by the contribution of the zeroth mode @xmath187",
    ". this formula will give us the main parameters characterizing the wl contribution in the ballistic limit .",
    "then , we evaluate the momenta sum in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath127 .",
    "the result of this calculation provide the local behavior of @xmath174 in the vicinity of the singularities .    to calculate the smooth part of @xmath174 , denoted hereinafter by @xmath189 , we start by evaluating the zero mode contribution to @xmath124 . a straightforward calculation of the term @xmath187 yields @xmath190}{\\hbar^{3}\\pi^3 [ 1 +    ( \\omega \\tau)^2]^6}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking , now , the fourier transform we obtain : @xmath191 where @xmath192 .",
    "we remark , here , that the above formula applies only in the ballistic regime , where the zeroth mode is dominant . in the diffusive systems ,",
    "the zero mode contribution is negligible compared to that coming from the momenta sum in regime @xmath193 ( which is absent in the ballistic case ) .",
    "formula ( [ envelope ] ) allows one to characterize the major features of the wl contribution to the structure factor : the time @xmath194 where @xmath195 is maximal ; its value at this point , @xmath196 ; and the width of the time interval where the wl effects are appreciable , @xmath197 .",
    "the results are : @xmath198 and @xmath199 where the interval width is defined by @xmath200 .",
    "thus wl effects , in the ballistic limit , are pronounced within a time interval of width @xmath201 centered at @xmath202 , and the typical value of the wl contribution is proportional to @xmath203 .",
    "note that these results are independent of the size of the system .",
    "therefore the gross behavior of @xmath174 is not influenced by the periodic orbits of the clean system .",
    "it is natural to ask what is the role the classical orbits of the system ?",
    "as we show below , these orbits lead to the singular features decorating the smooth part of the structure factor @xmath195 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "12 .    in analyzing this singular behavior",
    ", we first notice that its main part comes from large @xmath127 or equivalently large values of the momenta @xmath164 and @xmath165 . therefore , to calculate this contribution it is sufficient to approximate the discrete angular sum of @xmath115 ( over the phase between the vectors @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) by an integral .",
    "the small parameter of this approximation is @xmath204 . from ( [ iresult ] )",
    "one finds that the angular average of the wl contribution to the free energy , denoted by @xmath205 , is : @xmath206 where @xmath207 and @xmath208 at asymptotically large values of @xmath153 the leading contribution comes from @xmath209 .",
    "this is evident once noticing that when @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and therefore @xmath212 whereas @xmath213 .",
    "next we apply the poisson summation formula to convert the sum over @xmath164 and @xmath165 into an integral .",
    "the free energy is then expressed as @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are integer vectors . as will be shown below , these integer vectors are associated with winding numbers of the periodic orbits of the clean system .",
    "each term in formula ( [ sumterms ] ) is of the form @xmath217 where @xmath218 here @xmath219 is the bessel function of zero order , and @xmath220 is the magnitude of the vector @xmath215 . for @xmath221 this integral yields @xmath222 for @xmath223 the integral ( [ eq : km ] ) can be calculated using the steepest descents method ( see appendix b ) , and in the large @xmath23 limit it gives @xmath224    the above results imply the following form of the structure factor @xmath225 where @xmath226~\\tilde{t}^2 e^{-\\tilde{t } }    \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the contribution associated with orbits characterized by the winding vectors @xmath216 and @xmath215 . here",
    "@xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 is the step function .",
    "the amplitude of each contribution , @xmath230 , depends on the values @xmath216 and @xmath215 . for cases where either @xmath216 or @xmath215 vanish ,",
    "@xmath231 , while if @xmath34 and @xmath23 are large , @xmath232 .",
    "thus , @xmath174 is composed of a smooth contribution ( [ envelope ] ) and a sequence of singular functions , of the form @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the period of a composite orbit , i.e. the sum of periods of two periodic orbits of the clean system .",
    "each singular contribution is negative , and its magnitude at time @xmath234 is proportional to @xmath235 .",
    "the contribution associated with single orbits ( i.e.  when either @xmath34 or @xmath23 vanish ) is considerably larger than that of composite orbit ( in which both @xmath34 and @xmath23 differ from zero ) . in any case , the singular contribution decreases exponentially in time , and as a power law in @xmath134 ( when @xmath236 ) .",
    "this behavior is indeed observed in figs .",
    "10 , 11 , and 12 .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the wl contributions to the two - level correlation function and its fourier transform , the structure factor . these are the leading quantum interference effects which affect the spectral statistical properties of the system defined in ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "our theory generalize previous calculations of the wl contribution to the spectral statistics of diffusive systems@xcite by extending them into the ballistic regime where the elastic mean free path , @xmath2 , is of order of the size of the system , @xmath3 . here",
    "the disorder is weak enough to leave traces of the dynamics of the underlying clean system , which appear as singularities in the structure factor ( figs .",
    "[ fig : results ] , [ fig : resultswnum ] , and [ fig : exactdigrams1 ] ) .",
    "our study has been focused on spectral rather than dynamical characteristics to avoid the problem of specifying the manifold on which wl takes place .",
    "indeed fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] demonstrates that the wl contribution is pronounced in two limits .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "10 is a representative example of the results deep in the diffusive regime @xmath172 , while panel ( b ) shows the typical behavior in the ballistic limit , @xmath237 . in both cases ,",
    "the system approaches the strong localization limit , but the localization is of different nature . in the diffusive case , it is localization in real space @xcite , whereas in the ballistic case the localization is on a quasi - one - dimensional annulus in the momentum space .",
    "( this is evident once noticing that on clean torus , eigenstates are plain waves and therefore the particle is localized in momentum space . ) in the latter case , it is suggestive that the effective dynamics is associated with levy flights @xcite rather than diffusion , since the disorder couples , predominantly , momentum states with degenerate eigenvalues , which may lie far away along the momentum annulus@xcite .",
    "a simple semiclassical interpretation of our results , within periodic orbit theory , is not straightforward .",
    "the results , clearly , can not be obtained from a diagonal approximation in which higher order @xmath238 corrections are added to gutzwiller s trace formula ( e.g.  diffracting orbits , creeping orbits , etc .  ) .",
    "one can easily verified that such approximation yields only a positive contribution , in contrast with our results .",
    "this type of correction might explain the smooth positive part of the wl contribution , @xmath195 .",
    "however , a correct analysis within periodic orbit theory must go beyond the diagonal approximation , and take into account pairing of orbits which are not related by symmetry , but have actions exponentially close one to the other ( up to a constant phase , @xmath239 , which is needed in order to explain the negative contribution of the periodic orbits ) .",
    "the fact that the wl contribution may become negative at certain times implies that the system exhibits anti - weak - localization at certain regions in phase space .",
    "this may be related to anti - scarring effects observed in wave functions of chaotic billiards@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our work still elucidates several features of the leading wl effects in ballistic chaotic systems .",
    "first it shows that it appears within a finite interval of time ; second , it has a singular behavior associated with periodic orbits and linear combinations of periodic orbits ; third it can have different signs at different points in phase space .    these results have important consequences : first they show that the dominant contribution to the wl , in the ballistic regime , does not come from the eight - shaped orbits ( fig .",
    "1c ) , as suggested by the diagrammatic picture .",
    "the main contribution comes from diffracting orbits ( which are not related to the classical periodic orbits of the system ) , as well as from the original periodic orbits of the system .",
    "moreover , the zero mode contribution , defining @xmath195 , plays a dominant role here , while according to the results of the ballistic @xmath4-model it should vanish ( since the zero mode of the @xmath4-model is identical to rmt ) .",
    "the apparent contradiction between our results and those of the ballistic @xmath4-model is probably due to the fact that the ballistic @xmath4-model does not account correctly for the return probability .",
    "this is also manifested by the so called `` repetition problem '' which is a small mismatch , associated with repetitions of periodic orbits , between the exact asymptotic results of periodic orbit theory and those of the ballistic @xmath4-model .",
    "ideas associated with memory effects in long range random potential@xcite may be useful in resolving this problem .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank igor aleiner , alex altland , boris altshuler , john chalker , igor lerner , and rob smith for useful discussions .",
    "this work has been initiated at the `` extended workshop on disorder , chaos and interactions in mesoscopic systems '' ( trieste , aug .",

    "in this appendix we calculate useful integrals frequently encountered when calculating diagrams which appear in this paper .",
    "the first type of such integrals appear when integrating products of retarded and advanced green functions over the energy .",
    "the integral is of the form : @xmath240 where @xmath34 and @xmath23 are non - zero integers . applying the cauchy theorem , and using the fact that the coefficient @xmath241 of a laurent series , @xmath242 of a function with an @xmath34-th order pole is @xmath243_{z = z_{0}}$ ] , one immediately gets @xmath244    the second type of integral appears when integrating over momenta in @xmath245 dimensions , e.g. in the calculation of the wl contribution to the free energy ( [ dimreg ] ) in the diffusive limit .",
    "this family of integrals is of the form @xmath246 where @xmath34 is an integer , @xmath245 is a real number , and @xmath247 denotes the measure in @xmath245 dimensions . since the integrand is independent of the angles , the angular integral yields @xmath248 .",
    "this formula should be understood as an analytic continuation of a function defined on an infinite set of integer values of @xmath245 .",
    "changing the integration variable to @xmath249 yields @xmath250 integrating over x , then changing the integration variable to @xmath251 , and integrating over @xmath252 we obtain @xmath253 as the last step , we use the relation @xmath254 to simplify the expression .",
    "the result is : @xmath255    we turn now to evaluate the integral which appears when calculating diagrams in the ballistic limit , namely the integral defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : int1 ] ) .",
    "it will be calculated in the regime @xmath256 ( corresponding to the diffusive limit ) and then analytically continued to the full complex plain .",
    "it is natural to substitute @xmath257 which immediately transforms ( [ eq : int1 ] ) into the contour integral @xmath258 where @xmath259 are @xmath260 only the poles @xmath261 and @xmath262 , which lie inside the unit circle , contribute to the integral . thus using the residue theorem we get          in this appendix we evaluate the integral ( [ eq : km ] ) in the asymptotic limit @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "we begin by changing variables to @xmath267 and taking the leading term in @xmath268 .",
    "the result is @xmath269 being interested in the leading order expansion in @xmath270 , we further approximate the integral by substituting the asymptotic formula of the bessel function : @xmath271 as @xmath272 . representing the cosine as a sum of two exponents we arrive at :        @xmath273}. \\label{eq : beforethetwist } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two terms in the above sum will be handled separately .",
    "later , it will become clear , that the leading contribution to the integral comes from the plus - sign term .",
    "therefore , for the time being , we ignore the term with the minus sign . using the cauchy theorem we can deform the contour of the integrals such that its direction near the edge at @xmath274 is a steepest descent direction .",
    "the contour is further deformed to follow steepest descent curves as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutss ] .",
    "thus the contour consists of four segments : ( a ) from 0 to @xmath275 , ( b ) the part surrounding the cut , ( c ) an arc connecting these two segments at infinity , and ( d ) an arc connecting the end of the ( b ) path and the original end point at @xmath276    it is straightforward to check that the contribution from part ( a ) is of order @xmath277 .",
    "this contribution will turn out to be negligible compared to the one coming form segment ( b ) .",
    "it is also clear that the contributions of arcs ( c ) and ( d ) vanish , when their distance form the origin approaches infinity . thus we focus our attention on segment ( b ) .    to evaluate the integral we exponentiate the pre - exponent factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beforethetwist ] ) , and write the integral in the form @xmath278 where @xmath279 the steepest decent contour is found in the usual way : first , one takes the derivative of @xmath280 with respect to @xmath41 , @xmath281 and find the saddle point @xmath282 , satisfying @xmath283 .",
    "the result is @xmath284 where @xmath285 and @xmath286 are real numbers .",
    "second , one substitutes @xmath287 , where u and v are real , and solve for the curve which satisfies the condition @xmath288 the formula for this curve is @xmath289 rotating the axis as @xmath290 and @xmath291 , one obtains @xmath292 this exact form shows that the contour can be indeed deformed as shown in fig .",
    "it also provides the possibility of constructing the full asymptotic expansion of the integral .",
    "however , in view of the approximations which already have been made , we are interested only in the leading term .    thus , taking the quadratic approximation for the action : @xmath293 , with @xmath294 and evaluating the resulting gaussian integral we arrive at ( [ eq : kresult ] ) .",
    "notice that the result is proportional to @xmath204 .",
    "thus , the edge contribution ( which is of order @xmath277 ) can be indeed neglected .",
    "this calculation also shows that @xmath295 , and therefore the small parameter of this saddle point approximation is @xmath296 .",
    "the contribution of the second term in the sum ( [ eq : beforethetwist ] ) , i.e the one with the minus sign , is calculated following along the same lines .",
    "however , it turns out that in this case the deformed contour does not pass through a saddle point , and the only contribution comes from the edge at @xmath274 .",
    "it is , again , of order @xmath277 , and therefore can be neglected .",
