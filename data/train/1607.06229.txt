    "a model for a star interior is an important astrophysical question and hence it is pertinent to construct relativistic models as solutions of gravitational equation . for constructing static perfect fluid interiors for compact objects , we have two metric functions to determine while there is only one pressure isotropy equation for determining them . we need therefore to prescribe either a metric ansatz for one of the functions or an equation of state relating pressure and density or a fall off behavior for density or pressure . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( henceforth to be referred as paper i ) we had considered a fairly general buchdahl - vaidya - tikekar metric ( bvt ) @xcite ansatz covering almost all physically tenable known models and had shown that the pressure isotropy equation bore the same gauss form in all dimensions @xmath4 . by exploiting this property",
    "we established that a @xmath5-dimensional einstein solution for a given value of the vaidya - tikekar parameter @xmath6 , indicating deviation from sphericity of @xmath3-space geometry , could be lifted to a higher @xmath7-dimensional solution with @xmath2 being replaced by @xmath8 .",
    "that is , a static fluid interior solution in the usual @xmath5 dimension could be taken over to a higher dimensional solution .",
    "this is an interesting property of fluid solutions in einstein gravity and so the natural question that arises is that , is this also carried over to lovelock theory which is quintessentially higher dimensional ?",
    "interestingly the answer is yes , but it singles out pure lovelock from general lovelock theory . by pure lovelock",
    "we mean the action and consequently the equation of motion has only one @xmath0-th order term with no sum over lower orders .",
    "that is , a @xmath9-dimensional solution with a given @xmath10 can be taken over to higher @xmath7-dimensional solution with @xmath11 .",
    "this is yet another property that singles out pure lovelock gravity from all others .",
    "in addition to the vaidya - tikekar ( vt ) @xcite , the buchdahl ansatz @xcite also includes in the limit , the interesting finch - skea ansatz ( fs ) @xcite and so we also obtain the pure lovelock version of the fs solution . in this case",
    "the isotropy equation is not in the gauss but instead in the bessel form which for a given @xmath0 is the same for all dimensions .",
    "thus there is universality in behavior of star interiors corresponding to both bvt as well as fs models relative to a properly defined variable and also the parameter @xmath2 for the former . for the latter , for a given @xmath0",
    "the solution is the same in all dimensions .",
    "this is a very important property of fluid solutions making the star interior in the pure lovelock theory .",
    "the compactness hierarchy goes as the constant density star defining the limiting upper limit while fs holding the other end and the buchdahl including all other physically reasonable models lying between these two limits . for a given radius for star in critical @xmath12",
    ", mass is maximum for the einstein @xmath13 bearing out the fact that pure lovelock gravity becomes weaker with @xmath0 . we shall therefore study both vt and fs models and their physical properties for pure lovelock gravity .",
    "this is what would be the main subject matter of this paper , part ii of paper i.    there is a fairly large body of work on higher dimensional star which was comprehensively reviewed in paper i. instead of repeating that again here we would like to direct the reader to paper i @xcite for detailed references .",
    "it should however be admitted that higher dimensional fluid models are more for exploring and probing the gravitational dynamics rather than their direct physical and astrophysical applications .",
    "of course there always remains a little window open for emergence of a unified field theory involving higher dimensions where it may find some relevance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we recall the pure lovelock gravitational equation and set it for a perfect fluid distribution . in sec iii",
    ", we specialize to static spherically symmetric with the buchdahl ansatz and find solutions for vt and fs ansatzs , which is followed by matching of interior and exterior solution .",
    "the physically properties are discussed in sec v and we conclude with a discussion .",
    "there is a natural generalization of einstein action to lovelock action which is a homogeneous polynomial in riemann curvature with einstein being the linear order and the quadratic is gauss - bonnet ( gb ) .",
    "it has the remarkable property that on variation it still gives the second order quasi - linear equation which is its distinguishing feature .",
    "note that for pure lovelock with only one @xmath0th order term in the action without sum over lower orders , it is pure divergence ",
    "topological in @xmath14 , and in @xmath15 it has the same behavior of non - existence of non - trivial vacuum solution relative to lovelock analogue of riemann tensor @xcite as einstein has in three dimension ; i.e. gravity is kinematic . as for einstein ,",
    "pure lovelock gravity turns dynamic for dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "clearly lovelock is therefore a quintessentially higher dimensional gravitational theory for @xmath17 .",
    "if we introduce a set of @xmath18-rank tensors @xcite product of @xmath0 riemann tensors , completely antisymmetric , both in its upper and lower indices , @xmath19}_{\\qquad \\qquad a_{2n-1 } a_{2n}]}~. \\label{kastensor}\\ ] ] with all indices lowered , this tensor is also symmetric under the exchange of both groups of indices , @xmath20 . in terms of these new objects",
    "we can now write @xmath21    for pure lovelock of order @xmath0 we write @xmath22    now the pure lovelock gravitational equation for @xmath17 has the usual form @xmath23    we are going to solve this equation for a static spherically symmetric fluid distribution with @xmath24 as a model for star interior in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "let us begin with the general static spherically symmetric metric in @xmath7dimensional spacetime , @xmath25 substituting this metric in @xmath0th order pure lovelock equation eq .",
    "( [ leq ] ) , we obtain @xmath26    @xmath27    and the pressure isotropy equation is given by    @xmath28\\label{eqn_2 } = 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a prime indicates derivative relative to @xmath29 .",
    "it may be noted that these are general expressions for density , pressure and pressure isotropy for any lovelock order @xmath0 which have perhaps not been reported earlier anywhere .",
    "these would therefore be useful for all future considerations .",
    "before we go any further let s rule out the critical odd @xmath15 dimension case from further discussion .",
    "for a bound distribution describing interior of a compact object , the boundary is defined by @xmath30 which requires from equation ( [ eqn_4 ] ) , @xmath31 on the boundary .",
    "this conflicts with the matching with exterior vacuum solution .",
    "there can not therefore exist bound distribution in the critical odd @xmath15 dimensions @xcite .",
    "we shall henceforth only consider @xmath1 .",
    "note that we have only one equation ( [ eqn_2 ] ) to determine the two unknown metric functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 while the other equations ( [ eqn_3 ] - [ eqn_4 ] ) define the density and the pressure .",
    "hence it is imperative either to have an ansatz specifying one of the metric functions or an equation of state relating density and pressure or a fall off behaviour for density .",
    "we resort to a fairly general ansatz due to buchdahl @xcite prescribing the metric function @xmath32 as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "vaidya and tikekar ( vt ) further particularized @xcite it by writing @xmath36 , and wrote @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath2 here is @xmath39 in @xcite ) .",
    "they had given this parameter an interesting geometric meaning as deviation from sphericity of @xmath3-space geometry .",
    "it may also be noted that this parameter is required to be positive for density to be monotonically decreasing outwards from the center of distribution @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that this is how @xmath3-space geometry is related to density evolution of fluid .",
    "another interesting ansatz is due to finch and skea @xcite which is the limiting case of the buchdahl ansatz when @xmath40 , and then @xmath41    it should be stated that though there are solutions which are lying outside the buchdahl ansatz but they all seem to suffer from one or the other unphysical feature like density increasing outwards @xcite .",
    "so buchdahl ansatz covers all the physically tenable star models .",
    "we would therefore like to employ the ansatz for studying star interiors in pure lovelock gravity .",
    "in particular we would like to obtain solutions for star interior for the two ansatzs : vaidya - tikekar ( vt ) and finch - skea ( fs ) .",
    "for the buchdahl ansatz ( [ eq_b ] ) , eqs . ( [ eqn_2 ]  [ eqn_4 ] )",
    "take the following form    @xmath42    @xmath43    that can also be written as :    @xmath44    and the pressure isotropy equation takes the form @xmath45    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we write @xmath29 to @xmath46 to cast the above equation in the form @xmath47 where a prime here as well as henceforth will indicate derivative relative to argument .",
    "now there arise two cases corresponding to @xmath48 ( bvt ) and @xmath40 ( fs ) .",
    "when @xmath49 , we do the following change of variable @xmath50 then the isotropy equation becomes @xmath51 this is the gauss equation @xcite @xmath52f'(z)-abf(z)=0\\ ] ] with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the equation in question can be easily solved and the two independent solutions of equation ( [ eqn_9 ] ) around @xmath56 for @xmath57 are the hypergeometric functions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    as is the case for n=1 einstein gravity @xcite , the equation ( [ eqn_9 ] ) is the same for a given lovelock order @xmath0 in all @xmath57 dimensions with the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related as follows : @xmath62 here a subscript refers to spacetime dimension .",
    "it means that a @xmath9-dimensional solution could be lifted to a higher @xmath7-dimensional solution with @xmath10 being replaced by @xmath63 according to the above relation .",
    "this is because for a given @xmath0 , the equation has the same form and hence the same solution with appropriate @xmath2 parameter .    for the vt case , this relation takes the form @xmath64 this is the pure lovelock generalization of the einstein gravity relation for @xmath13 obtained in the paper i @xcite .    the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn_9 ] ) around @xmath56 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are arbitrary integration constants and @xmath69 is the hypergeometric function with @xmath70 note that @xmath71 and when the expression under the radical is whole square , the hypergeometric function becomes a polynomial .",
    "we thus have the complete solution for the isotropy equation for the buchdahl or vaidya - tikekar ansatz .",
    "when @xmath40 we write for @xmath57 @xmath72 and the isotropy equation ( [ eqn_8bis ] ) becomes @xmath73 where now @xmath74 is given in ( [ eqn_var2 ] ) and @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the bessel functions . the solution for a given lovelock order @xmath0 is the same for any dimension @xmath57 .",
    "this is the bessel equation and it is important to note it remains the same for a given @xmath0 in all dimensions .",
    "that is , for a given lovelock order @xmath0 , the solution is universal for the variable @xmath74 in all dimensions @xmath77 .",
    "the general solution is given by @xmath78    though in the critical odd @xmath15 dimensions there can be no bound fluid distributions , yet the solution of the isotropy equation ( [ eqn_8 ] ) for bvt and fs ansatz are respectively given as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath74 is given in ( [ eqn_var1 ] ) and @xmath80 where now @xmath81 .",
    "at the star boundary which is defined by @xmath30 , the solution must match with the pure lovelock vacuum solution in the exterior .",
    "this requires that the metric functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 must be continuous across the boundary .    in the interior for @xmath1",
    ", we have @xmath84 where @xmath33 is @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively for buchdahl and fs models and @xmath87 since it has to be matched to the pure lovelock vacuum exterior metric @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 the continuity of the metric components determines mass @xmath90 where we have @xmath91 for vt and @xmath40 for fs , and in both cases @xmath92 can be written as @xmath93 .",
    "taking continuity of @xmath92 and @xmath83 and some further manipulations lead to @xmath94 @xmath95 and then @xmath67 and @xmath68 are determined as @xmath96 where @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the star radius . for @xmath99 , the pressure from eq .",
    "( [ eqn_7bis ] ) is determined as @xmath100 where @xmath33 is as given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn_10][eqn_10bis ] ) and ( [ eqn_fs3][eqn_fs2 ] ) for buchdahl and finch skea models respectively .",
    "this completes the matching .",
    "one of the most important properties for a star model is the compactness . for a given radius how much mass",
    "could be packed in . in ref .",
    "@xcite , buchdahl has also obtained the compactness limit given by @xmath101 by requiring density to decrease monotonically from the center .",
    "this limit also follows from the constant density distribution @xcite for which sound speed becomes infinite .",
    "this naturally defines the limiting compactness .    from eq .",
    "( 32 ) , it is clear that @xmath102 indicating for a given star radius , mass is maximum for constant density distribution ( @xmath103 and minimum for fs ( @xmath40 and bvt ( @xmath104 ) lies in between these two limiting distributions .",
    "this equation also suggests that volume of star goes as @xmath105 for an effective density , @xmath106 .",
    "now for the critical even dimension @xmath12 , we have volume going as @xmath107 collapsing to @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "it seems to indicate that in the large @xmath0 limit volume effectively becomes area ! this clear shows that volume and thereby mass is maximum for @xmath13 and it goes on decreasing with @xmath0 .",
    "this is because unlike einstein gravity , while for pure lovelock as @xmath110 .",
    "] pure lovelock gravity becomes weaker with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this means stars are densest for einstein gravity and they become rarer as @xmath0 increases .    on the hand if we look at density as given in eq .",

    ", constant density @xmath114 will be the maximum , and hence @xmath115 .",
    "note that constant density can not be reached for fs because it requires @xmath103 .",

    "this clearly indicates the degree of compactness with constant density giving the upper limit while fs the lower limit , and all other physically acceptable models lying in between .    as an aside we also give pressure for constant density star with @xmath118 in vt model , which means @xmath103 for buchdahl , and it is given by @xmath119 for any lovelock order @xmath0 .      for @xmath118",

    "it is remarkable that this geometrical property has the physical imprint in the requirement that @xmath2 has to be non - negative for density to monotonically decrease outwards .",
