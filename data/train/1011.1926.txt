    "the most readily obtained phase - space observables for halo stars are their galactic angular coordinates , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , heliocentric radial distance , @xmath12 , and heliocentric line - of - sight velocity , @xmath13 . using its angular position and distance estimate , each star can be assigned a three - dimensional position vector in galactocentric cartesian coordinates , @xmath14 , and a radial velocity corrected for the solar and local standard of rest motions , @xmath15 .",
    "we begin by defining a scaling relation ( metric ) , @xmath16 , which combines these observables into a simple ` phase - space separation ' between two stars :    @xmath17    here , @xmath18 is the separation of a pair of stars in coordinate space ( in kiloparsecs ) , and @xmath19 is the difference in their radial velocities ( in kilometres per second ) .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath20 has units of @xmath21 , such that @xmath16 has units of kpc . the choice of @xmath20 is arbitrary unless a particular ` phase space scale ' of interest can be identified .",
    "this is not straightforward ; we discuss some possible choices below .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore @xmath22 , the cumulative two - point correlation function of halo stars in the metric defined by equation [ eqn : delta_metric ] . throughout",
    ", we use the estimator @xmath23 here @xmath24 counts the number of pairs in the sample separated by less than @xmath16 , and @xmath25 is the equivalent count for pairs of random points within the survey volume , averaged over several realizations . to generate these realizations we ` shuffle ' the data by randomly reassigning @xmath26 pairs to",
    "different @xmath27 coordinates drawn from the original catalogue and @xmath13 _ separately _ to different @xmath27 coordinates . ] .",

    "our @xmath16 metric is very similar to the @xmath28 metric of starkenburg et al . in the limit of small angular separations separation between two stars",
    "depends not only on their actual phase - space coordinates , but also on how accurately those coordinates are measured .",
    "for example , moving two stars 10 kpc further apart and simultaneously decreasing the error on their distance measurements by a factor of 10 ( relative to the average of the sample ) results in the same @xmath28 .",

    "the effects of these refinements to the sample on the recovered @xmath35 signal are discussed in section  [ sec : obsdata_clustering ] .",
    "the mock observations that we use to test the @xmath35 correlation function are derived from simulations of the accreted stellar halo presented in cooper et  al .",
    "these simulations approximate the dynamics of stars in dwarf satellites of milky way - like galaxies by ` tagging ' appropriate particles ( i.e. those strongly bound within subhaloes ) in the aquarius suite of high - resolution n - body simulations ( springel et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "each ` tag ' associates a dark matter ( dm ) particle with a particular stellar population of a given mass , age and metallicity .",
    "this ` tagging ' technique is reasonable in the regime of high mass - to - light ratios , which is supported in this case by observations of stellar kinematics in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. walker et  al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the tagging method has a single free parameter , the fraction of the most - bound particles chosen in each dm halo for each assignment of newly - formed stars ( for further details see cooper et  al .",
    "the value of this parameter ( 1 per cent ) was fixed by requiring the population of _ surviving _ satellites ( at the present day ) to have a distribution of half - light radius as a function of luminosity consistent with milky way and m31 observations .",
    "the cooper et  al .",
    "models differ from the earlier models of bullock & johnston ( 2005 ) in that they treat the full cosmological evolution of all satellites self - consistently in a single n - body simulation , and use a comprehensive semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ( bower et  al .",
    "2006 ) constrained by data on large scales and compatible with the observed mw satellite luminosity function . both the cooper et  al . and",
    "the bullock & johnston simulations produce highly structured stellar haloes built from the debris of disrupted dwarf galaxies . as we discuss further below , other halo components formed _ in situ _ may be present in real galaxies ( e.g. abadi , navarro & steinmetz 2006 ; zolotov et  al . 2009 ; font et  al .",
    "2011 ) but these are expected to be more smoothly distributed than the accreted component ( e.g. helmi et  al .",

    "( 2010 ) , we refer to our six simulations as haloes aq - a , aq - b , aq - c , aq - d , aq - e and aq - f . from these simulations , we construct catalogues of tracer stars ( bhb stars , for example ) by converting the stellar mass assigned to each dark matter particle into an appropriate number of stars",
    ".    each dm particle can give rise to many tracer stars if it is tagged with sufficient stellar mass .",
    "we therefore interpolate the positions and velocities of these tracer stars between nearby tagged dm particles .",
    "to accomplish this , the 32 nearest phase space neighbours of each tagged particle are identified using a procedure which we describe below . the mean dispersion in each of the six phase - space coordinates is then calculated for each particle as an average over its neighbours .",
    "these dispersions define a 6d ellipsoidal gaussian kernel centred on the particle , from which the positions and velocities of its tracer stars are drawn randomly",
    ". each progenitor galaxy ( a set of tagged dm particles accreted by the main ` milky way ' halo as members of a single subhalo ) is treated individually in this smoothing operation , i.e. particles are smoothed using only neighbours from the same progenitor ( so there is no ` cross talk ' between streams from different progenitors ) .",
    "this procedure can be thought of as a crude approximation to running our original simulation again including each tracer star as a test particle .",
    "the ` distance in phase space ' used to identify neighbours in the interpolation scheme is defined by a scaling relation between distances in configuration space and velocity space metric we define for our analysis of clustering . ] . for each progenitor",
    ", we adopt an individual scaling which corresponds to making the median pairwise interparticle separation of its particles in configuration space ( at @xmath36 ) equal to their median separation in velocity space . in practice",
    ", the value of this scaling parameter makes very little difference to the results we present , when compared to the extreme choice of selecting only 32 velocity or position neighbours ( disregarding the other three coordinates in each case ) .",
    "giving more weight to configuration - space neighbours smears out velocity substructure within the debris of a progenitor ( for example , where two wraps of a stream pass near one another ) . giving more weight to velocity neighbours has the opposite effect ",
    "stars can be interpolated over arbitrarily large separations in configuration space , but coherent velocity structures are preserved .",
    "therefore , the ` optimal ' choice is the scaling which balances smoothing in configuration space against smoothing in velocity space .    to quantify this balance between smoothing in configuration and velocity space ,",
    "we compute six smoothing lengths for each particle , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 represents a single dimension in space or velocity . to compute these dispersions",
    ", we use the 32 nearest phase - space neighbours of each particle .",
    "we define the ` optimum ' choice of scaling for _ each _ progenitor galaxy as that which minimises the quantity    @xmath40    this is the sum in quadrature of the mean smoothing lengths in configuration and velocity space , normalized respectively by @xmath41 , the ` minimal ' mean smoothing length in configuration space ( obtained from the 32 nearest configuration space neighbours ) and @xmath42 , the ` minimal ' mean smoothing length in velocity space ( obtained from the 32 nearest velocity space neighbours ) .",
    "we find that the scaling obtained by matching the median interparticle separations in position and velocity as described above is typically a good approximation to this optimal value  a similar result is discussed in more detail by maciejewski et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    in the cooper et  al .",
    "model , when a given stellar population is formed , the most bound 1% of dm particles in the corresponding dark halo at that time are chosen as dynamical tracers of that population .",
    "hence , each dm _ particle _ to which stars are assigned has an individual mass - to - light ratio , m / l , which can be as high as @xmath43 ( i.e. @xmath44 ) and as low as @xmath45 .",
    "this will affect the density of stars seeded by a dm particle independently of the density of its neighbours in phase space ( i.e. a low m / l particle will create a denser ` cluster ' of tracers relative to a high m / l particle with the same neighbouring positions and velocities ) .",
    "we have tested an alternative approach in which the m / l of each particle in a given progenitor is resampled by distributing the total stellar mass of the progenitor evenly amongst its tagged particles .",
    "we find that the extra clustering due to a few ` hot ' particles in our default approach makes no difference to our results .",
    "each n - body dark matter particle in our simulation contributes a number of tracer stars to our mock observations , based on the stellar population with which it has been ` tagged ' . in the specific case of our comparisons to sdss",
    ", these tracers are bhb stars meeting the selection criteria of xue et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) . here",
    "we assume a global scaling between the stellar mass associated with each n - body particle , @xmath46 , and the number of bhbs it contributes to our mock catalogues , i.e. @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of tracer stars per unit mass of the original stellar population .",
    "for each n - body particle , the actual number of bhb stars generated is drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath49 .",
    "the correlation function results described below are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath48 , provided that the underlying distribution is well - sampled at a given scale .",
    "we have therefore selected a fiducial value of @xmath50 . in creating the mock catalogue",
    ", we do not include any stars gravitationally bound to satellites .",
    "however , we do include stars in their tidal tails ( which , by our definition , are part of the stellar halo ) .",
    "using our simulated bhb catalogues , we create mock observations for comparison to the xue et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) data as follows .",
    "first we located the observer at a radius @xmath51 from the centre of the halo . for our main comparison to the data ,",
    "we restrict all observers to the same ` galactic plane ' , with each random vantage point differing only in its azimuthal angle in this plane and in the ` polarity ' of the galactic rotation axis ( the @xmath52 coordinate ) .",
    "however , the orientation of the rotation axis can not be directly constrained by the simulation , which only models the _ accreted _ component of the halo and the bulge , and not the in situ formation of a stellar disc . as described in cooper et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the accreted ` bulge ' is prolate or mildly triaxial .",
    "we define the minor axis of this bulge component ( conservatively defined by all accreted stars within @xmath53  kpc ; cooper et  al .",
    "2010 ) as the galactic @xmath52 axis .",
    "this axis is essentially identical to the minor axis of the dark halo within @xmath53  kpc .",
    "there are other plausible choices of galactic plane ( for example , relative to the shape or spin vectors of the entire dark halo , rather than the stars in its inner regions ) . however , any choice is somewhat arbitrary without a self - consistent simulation of disc formation .",
    "having chosen a location for the observer , we select all tracer stars within the spectroscopic footprint of sdss dr6 having galactocentric distance in the range 2060  kpc ( our principal comparison will focus on the outer halo as defined by this distance range , although we also study the ranges 560  kpc and 520  kpc below ) .",
    "galactic longitude and latitude are defined such that @xmath54 is the vector directed from the observer to the centre of the halo .",
    "we set the heliocentric velocity components of each star assuming a solar motion of @xmath55 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) and a velocity of the local standard of rest about the galactic centre @xmath56 .",
    "we compute @xmath57 and @xmath58 as described by xue et  al .",
    "finally , distances and velocities are convolved with gaussian observational errors of @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ( xue et  al .",
    "2008 ) .    in both the mock observations and the real data ,",
    "the average random pair count @xmath61 is calculated by reshuffling distances and velocities among the positions on the sky of stars many times .",
    "we find that by using 500 random catalogues to calculate @xmath61 for each mock observation and performing 500 mock observations in each halo , we obtain a sufficiently well - converged estimate of the distribution of @xmath35 .",

    "to match the turnover in the configuration space separation correlation function.,width=317 ]    before @xmath35 can be computed , a value must be chosen for the velocity - to - distance scaling @xmath20 in equation [ eqn : delta_metric ] .",

    "we caution that although the scales on which we match the one - dimensional correlation functions are somewhat smaller than the smoothing scales we adopt to create the random distributions , this does not guarantee that our choice of @xmath20 is unaffected by our choice of smoothing .",

    "the overall trend of @xmath35 is similar to the observations in all haloes , although the clustering signal rises more steeply on small scales in most of the simulations . on scales",
    "@xmath81  kpc , significant clustering is detected by all observers in five of the six haloes .",

    "aq - c ( purple ) is entirely inconsistent with the milky way observations on all scales , showing a much higher degree of clustering . beyond @xmath84  kpc , the sky of an observer in aq - c",
    "is dominated by two bright tidal streams on wide ( @xmath6  kpc ) orbits . although their orbital planes are approximately coincident with our definition of the galactic plane , nevertheless sections of these streams intrude on the sdss footprint at low galactic latitudes .         the dr6 footprint and the cut on extra - planar height in the xue et  al . ( 2008 )",

    "( a ) the orientation of the galactic plane with respect to the halo is chosen randomly for each of the 500 mock observers ( i.e. observers are distributed over a sphere of radius @xmath85  kpc ) , whereas in panel ( b ) the galactic z direction is aligned with the minor axis of the halo for all observers as in fig .  [ fig : sdss_mock_pa ] . to focus on the effects of this alignment ,",
    "the distances and velocities of stars in these two panels have _ not _ been convolved with observational errors .    the systematically higher clustering signals in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_no ] suggest that the plane perpendicular to the minor axis of the dark matter halo is special . in cooper",
    "( 2010 ) and above , we have noted the strong correlation between the shape of the dark halo and the inner regions of the stellar halo .",
    "this alignment of halo structure also extends , more loosely , to other prominent stellar halo structures at large distances .",
    "an overall flattening of the stellar halo arises because our dark matter haloes are embedded in long - lived filaments of the cosmic web .",
    "typically one or two such filaments dominate the infall directions of both satellite galaxies and smoothly accreted dark matter , which also contributes to the shape of the dark halo ( e.g. libeskind et  al . 2005 ; lovell et  al . 2011 ; wang et  al . 2011 ; vera - ciro et  al .",
    "the distribution of stars stripped from infalling satellites echoes the large - scale correlation of their orbital planes .",
    "because of this flattened global structure , the distribution of halo stars in our choice of galactic plane tend to be more smoothly distributed ( i.e. this plane contains more diffuse phase - mixed material as well as coherent substructure ) .",
    "panel ( b ) demonstrates how the ` contrast ' of small scale substructure in the outer halo is enhanced when these smoother components are excluded from the clustering analysis ( through a combination of the sdss footprint and the cut on @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of aq - f , where the majority of the mass in the halo is contributed by one extensive and relatively ` smooth ' component .",
    "by contrast , in aq - c the average clustering amplitude _ decreases _ on large scales when we fix the galactic plane . as noted above , in this case the massive coherent streams that dominate the clustering signal of this halo mostly fall outside the sdss footprint .",
    "panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_no ] shows the randomly aligned observations of panel ( a ) convolved with observational errors in distance and velocity .",
    "these errors ` smooth out ' the halo , suppress the clustering signal overall and increase the variance between observers on small scales . again",
    "the effect is most pronounced for aq - f , where blurring of the dominant smooth component further decreases the contrast of substructure . in most cases",
    "these two effects ( alignment and observational errors ) counteract each other to produce the distribution of signals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_pa ] . in the case of aq",
    "- e the signal suffers disproportionately from errors in the aligned configuration , perhaps because this signal is due to a small number of pairs at large distances .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_distance ] we examine differences between nearby and more distant halo stars ( also discussed by xue et  al .",
    "the left - hand panel corresponds to the full range of the xue et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) sample ( @xmath86  kpc ) , the central panel corresponds to nearby stars ( @xmath87  kpc ) which we excluded in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_pa ] , and the right - hand panel corresponds to the most distant stars in the sample ( @xmath88  kpc ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_real ] , including nearby stars considerably reduces the amplitude of @xmath35 for milky way halo bhbs , although the signal in the lowest bins remains significantly above zero .",
    "the observational data are dominated by stars at @xmath89  kpc and hence the milky way signal is essentially identical in the left and central panels .    in the whole - halo sample ( left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_distance ] ) some of the simulations ( particularly aq - a and aq - b ) show a reduction in @xmath35 on small scales , qualitatively similar to the observations . nevertheless fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_distance ] suggests that the contrast of structure against smoothly distributed stars is too high in our models , and that the discrepancy is most pronounced in the inner halo . selecting an inner - halo sample ( central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_distance ] ) emphasises this point .",
    "the inner halo shows a similar degree of clustering in all six haloes , in all cases somewhat lower than the outer halo signal ( on intermediate scales ) , but much stronger than the milky way data .",
    "this panel reinforces our comments above on the structure of the haloes : aq - c resembles aq - a and aq - d in the inner halo , because this distance range excludes the massive coherent streams that are the likely source of the strong signal seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_pa ] .",
    "most of the coherent structure in aq - e is nearby and the inclusion of stars at greater distances _ diminishes _ the average signal .",
    "this is in contradiction to the phase - mixing explanation for a more structured outer halo , but aq - e is unusual in that for @xmath89  kpc it is dominated by a highly oblate , coherently rotating component ( somewhat resembling a very thick disc , but with a significant radial velocity dispersion ) .",
    "aq - b has a similar spherically averaged density profile to aq - e , but here the inner halo shows less correlation , as expected . in aq - f @xmath35",
    "is dominated by nearby stars , although these are highly clustered in phase space .         the comparison with more distant stars shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_mock_distance ] suggest that most of the models are consistent with the data in this region of the halo .",
    "only aq - c is clearly discrepant ( aq - d is marginally inconsistent at scales below @xmath90  kpc ) . that our simulations more closely match the outer regions of the halo ( beyond @xmath91  kpc ) supports the view that these regions are dominated by stars accreted from satellites ( xue et  al .",
    "2011 ; font et  al .",
    "the outer stellar halo of the milky way appears to be typical ( or perhaps slightly more structured than average ) with respect to our sample of six plausible realizations of dark matter haloes with similar mass .",
    "we have analysed a correlation function for halo stars , @xmath35 , defining their separation in four dimensions of phase space using a metric ( which we call @xmath16 ) in readily - obtained observables ( angular and radial separation and radial velocity difference ) .",
    "a statistic of this type usefully quantifies kinematic and spatial substructure in the halo , and can be applied to observational data and catalogues generated from theoretical models .",
    "this analysis is particularly well suited to the distant halo  other methods for studying clustering in many dimensions may be more suitable for the ` fine grained ' data on the nearby halo that will be obtained by the _ gaia _ mission ( e.g. gmez et  al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we have measured @xmath35 for a large catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed bhb stars from sdss ( xue et  al .",
    "we find significant clustering in these data , particularly when we restrict the sample to stars with galactocentric distance @xmath75  kpc .",
    "this finding of stronger phase space correlations between stars in the outer halo is in agreement with that of xue et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    to test models of the accreted components of stellar haloes and understand the effects of sample variance , we have computed @xmath35 for mock observations constructed from the six @xmath0cdm simulations of cooper et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) in which only the stellar haloes produced by disrupted satellites are considered .",
    "our statistic distinguishes quantitatively between these six qualitatively different halo realizations .",
    "when only stars with @xmath75  kpc are considered , five of our six simulations show statistically significant correlations on scales in our metric equivalent to @xmath92  kpc ( for all observers on the solar circle ) .",
    "most of the models are consistent with the milky way data for the outer halo , @xmath93  kpc .",
    "for the inner halo , however , particularly at galactocentric distances smaller than 20  kpc , the simulations tend to be significantly more strongly clustered than the data .",
    "one possible explanation for this is a deficiency of smoothly distributed halo stars in the models , perhaps attributable to the absence of so - called ` in situ ' halo stars .",
    "these stars may be scattered from the galactic disc , or born on eccentric orbits ( in streams of accreted gas or an unstable cooling flow , for example ) .",
    "neither of these processes are included in our model of the accreted halo .",
    "although it seems reasonable to expect that in situ haloes are distributed with spherical or axial symmetry and have a low degree of coherence in phase space , models of such components and predictions for the fraction of stars they contain are not well constrained .",
    "most hypotheses for in situ halo formation limit these stars to an ` inner ' halo and predict that the accreted component ( which we simulate ) dominates at larger radii ( e.g. abadi et  al .",
    "2006 ; zolotov et  al . 2009",
    "; font et  al . 2011 ) .",
    "however , the fraction of the halo formed in situ and the boundary between ` inner ' and ` outer ' halo are highly model - dependent .",
    "detections of observable ` dichotomies ' in the milky way halo ( carollo et  al . 2007 ) are still debated ( e.g. schnrich , asplund & casagrande 2011 ; beers et  al .",
    "it is possible to place broad limits on the fraction of stars in a ` missing ' smooth component , for example by comparing the rms variation of projected star - counts in our models ( helmi et  al .",
    "2011b ) to the milky way ( bell et  al .",
    "2008 ) . however , the uncertainties involved are substantial .",
    "another factor in the discrepancy between the models and the data may be the absence of a baryonic ( disc ) contribution to the gravitational potential .",
    "a massive disc could alter the process of satellite disruption in the inner halo and might make the potential within @xmath91  kpc more spherical ( kazantzidis , abadi & navarro 2010 ) , possibly distributing more inner halo stars into the sdss footprint ( on the other hand , a more axisymmetric or spherical dark halo might also result in fewer chaotic orbits , hence more coherent streams ) .",
    "because of these modelling uncertainties , our application of the @xmath35 statistic can presently serve only as a basic test for the abundance of substructure in the simulations .",
    "several aspects of our approach could be improved .",
    "it seems desirable to use well - measured radial velocity data to enhance clustering signals such as our correlation function relative to those based on configuration space data alone .",
    "however , so far , no proposal for including these velocity data is well - supported by theory . here",
    ", we have used a straightforward choice of parametrised metric to illustrate the concept of scaling radial velocity separations to ` equivalent ' configuration space separations , and this is empirically useful in recovering a measurable signal .",
    "nevertheless , we have not found any compelling or generic way to select the scaling parameter ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "improving either the definition of the metric itself or the means of fixing this parameter is a clear priority for extensions of this approach .",
    "a similar issue affects the weighting of velocity information in clustering algorithms ( e.g. sharma et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "finally , further comparisons between stellar halo models and observational data should also account for the selection effects such spectroscopic incompleteness and the potential bias of bhb stars as a tracer of the stellar halo ( bell et  al .",
    "2010 ; xue et  al .",
    "2011 ) . for statistical analysis",
    ", there is a pressing requirement for observational samples with well - understood selection functions , even if they do not probe the most distant halo .",
    "the lamost galactic survey is likely to be the first to approach this goal .    in summary ,",
    "we have taken a first step in adapting a well - studied cosmological statistic , the two - point correlation function , to the study of the milky way halo .",
    "our comparisons highlight the complexity of statistical analysis in the stellar halo , and the importance of interpreting observational results in the context of realistic models of halo assembly .",
