    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) as the most attractive extension of the standard model is realized at low energies , the next generation of high energy physics experiments at tevatron , lhc and a future @xmath3 linear collider will discover supersymmetric particles . particularly at a linear collider",
    ", it will be possible to perform measurements with high precision @xcite which allows us to test the underlying susy model . according to work done by the lhc / lc study group @xcite",
    ", the experimental accuracies for the determination of the neutralino masses of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are 50  mev and 80  mev , respectively , at the sps1a benchmark point @xcite . to match this accuracy",
    "it is indispensable to include higher order radiative corrections .    in the framework of the standard model many calculations of quark pole masses",
    "were performed to two - loop @xcite-@xcite and three - loop order @xcite .",
    "electroweak vector bosons were also studied in @xcite-@xcite in this respect . within the mssm important results on quark self - energies were obtained in @xcite-@xcite . finally , in @xcite the gluino pole mass to two - loop order was calculated .",
    "general formulae for susy qcd corrections to fermion pole masses in the mssm were derived in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the two - loop strong interaction corrections to the neutralinos within the mssm in a completely independent way . we make a detailed numerical analysis for the benchmark point sps1a. we agree with the analytic formulae given in @xcite .",

    "we checked our analytic one - loop calculation against previous work @xcite in the on - shell scheme and found agreement .",
    "the nine different types of two - loop diagrams stem from susy qcd operator insertions into the quark / squark neutralino one - loop self - energy and can be grouped into those containing inner gluon ( fig .",
    "[ ne2lgluon ] ) , gluino ( fig .  [ ne2lgluino ] ) and squark lines ( fig .",

    "the diagrams and the amplitudes were generated in feynarts 3.2 @xcite and simplified analytically using feyncalc 4.0.2 @xcite . a small ir regulator mass parametrized artificial ir divergencies , and it was checked analytically that they cancel each other in the final result . according to the -scheme",
    "the uv - divergencies are regulated dimensionally by @xmath21 , and the unphysical scalar mass parameter @xmath22 for the evanescent fields is absorbed according to @xcite .",
    "the resulting integrals have a rather complex tensor structure which was reduced to a set of basis integrals using tarcer @xcite .",
    "the resulting expressions are , however , too lengthy to be given here .",
    "the numerical analysis was then performed by implementing tsil @xcite in a fortran program which was auto - generated with the help of mathematica .",
    "apart from the check of gauge independence , we used the usual t hooft feynman @xmath23 gauge for the gluon field .",

    "the two - loop corrections to the masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are of the order of @xmath40  gev lying far beyond the expected eperimental accuracy of @xmath41  gev @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ mu ] we vary @xmath42 from 300  gev to 700  gev .",

    "the plot is over @xmath43 , @xmath42 is set to @xmath44  gev and all other values are taken from sps1a. taking over experimental accuracy from sps1a which is 0.05% for @xmath45 we again find important corrections in this scenario ( one tick on the vertical axis is 0.2% ) .    in fig .",
    "[ msq3 ] we show the one- and two - loop neutralino mass shifts as a function of the third generation soft susy breaking masses @xmath46 .",

    "we have checked analytically the gauge-@xmath47 independence of the sum of those diagrams containing inner gluon lines in the t hooft gauge .",
    "the diagrams containing gluon lines provide @xmath48-scalar mass contributions which were treated separately and shown to drop out by redefining the soft bilinear squark breaking parameters @xcite .",
    "the scaling behaviour given by the @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] structure of our results was checked against the renormalization group prediction @xcite analytically and numerically . for the latter , fig .",
    "[ rendep ] illustrates the improvement of the scale dependence for the pole masses of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the two plots with only a red and a black line are zooms of the respective plots to their left in order to illustrate graphically the improvement when going from one- to two - loop level .",
    "for this plot we used the rge subroutines of spheno @xcite which were extended to include also running standard model parameters .",
    "the remaining scale dependence of the neutralino pole masses indicate that further non - susy qcd corrections like yukawa - interactions will give relevant contributions .",
    "the analytic rge check is equivalent to the uv finiteness in the on - shell scheme .",
    "the trace of the square of the tree - level mass matrix , @xmath53 is a sum of squared mass parameters and involves the whole set of two - loop self - energies when renormalized .",

    "one has @xmath67 .",
    "the absence of strong interactions at the one - loop level is reflected by the fact that the @xmath18 factor in @xmath61 only stems from @xmath68 in eq .",

    "second , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eqrunt ] ) has to be compensated by the @xmath69-dependence of the mass shifts @xmath12 in eq .",

    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eqdeft ] ) the one - loop shift @xmath70 has to be differentiated with respect to all @xmath18-running parameters .",
    "again , one - loop squared terms can not contribute due to the absence of @xmath18 at the one - loop level .    as a last check ,",
    "an independent c - program was written to evaluate the formulae given in @xcite which agrees numerically with our auto - generated code up to the seventh relevant digit .",
    "combining existing software packages @xcite we have calculated the two - loop corrections in @xmath15 to the neutralino pole masses in the mssm in the scheme .",
    "we have shown that the results are important for matching theory and experiment at future colliders .",
    "many checks have been succesful and the renormalization scale dependence is improved .",
    "however , it seems to be necessary to include further corrections , e.g. the leading two - loop yukawa corrections @xmath71 .",
