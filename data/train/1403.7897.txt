    "recently , spectrum of low - lying @xmath0 resonances with negative parity was investigated employing an extended constituent quark model  , within which the @xmath0 resonances were considered as admixtures of three- and five - quark components , and the hyperfine interaction between quarks was taken to be of three different kinds , namely , one gluon exchange ( oge )  @xcite , goldstone boson exchange ( gbe )  @xcite , and instanton - induced interaction ( ins )  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , mixing of three- and five - quark @xmath0 states was calculated by treating the @xmath6 creation mechanism as the one induced by instanton interaction .",
    "it is shown that the mixing between three- and five - quark components in @xmath0 resonances with spin - parity @xmath3 is very small and negligible , but in the @xmath4 @xmath0 resonances the mixing is very strong , and the mixing decreases the energy of the lowest @xmath4 state to be around @xmath7 mev .",
    "it is very interesting that this energy is lower than energy of the lowest spin - parity @xmath3 @xmath0 resonance .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the instanton quark - antiquark pair creation precludes transitions between @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations , while the instanton - induced hyperfine interaction between a quark and an antiquark could lead to mixing between five - quark @xmath0 configurations with light quark - antiquark pair and @xmath10 pair  .",
    "therefore , once we take the instanton - induced hyperfine interaction and quark - antiquark pair creation simultaneously , mixing between between @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations will not vanish .",
    "but if the hyperfine interaction between quarks is chosen as oge or gbe , the instanton - induced quark - antiquark pair creation mechanism can not result in mixing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations .",
    "generally , even if probability of @xmath9 component in @xmath0 resonances may be small , but it should not be exactly @xmath11 . this may indicate that once we take the instanton - induced quark - antiquark pair creation , we have to keep the hyperfine interaction between quarks being based on the same model .    in the present work ,",
    "we try to calculate mixing between three- and five - quark components in low - lying @xmath0 resonances with negative parity using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) approach  @xcite , which was originally constructed for nucleons that interact via an effective two - body contact interaction , and later developed to include the quark freedom  @xcite .",
    "analogous to the instanton interaction  @xcite , the njl model can describe various aspects of qcd related to the dynamical and explicit breaking of chiral symmetry and the axial anomaly very well  @xcite . as discussed above , here we take the hyperfine interactions between quarks to be also the njl induced one for model consistency .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : frame ] , we present our theoretical framework , which includes explicit forms of the njl - induced quark - quark hyperfine interactions , and quark - antiquark pair creation mechanism .",
    "numerical results for the spectrum of the states under study and the mixing of three- and five - quark configurations in our model are shown in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : end ] contains a brief conclusion .",
    "in the present model , the hamiltonian is almost all the same as that using in   only except for the parts describe the quark - quark hyperfine interaction and mechanism for transition between three- and five - quark components in @xmath0 resonances . for completeness , here we also repeat the same parts .",
    "the hamiltonian describing @xmath0 resonances as admixtures of three- and five - quark components is of the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the hamiltonian for three - quark and five - quark systems , respectively , and @xmath15 denotes the transition between three- and five - quark systems . here",
    "we discuss the diagonal and non - diagonal terms of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in secs .",
    "[ dia ] and  [ ndia ] , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian for a @xmath16-particle system in the constituent quark model can be written as the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the hamiltonians for the quark orbital motion and for the hyperfine interactions between quarks , respectively , @xmath20 denotes the constituent mass of the @xmath21 quark .",
    "the first term @xmath18 can be written as a sum of the kinetic energy term and the quark confinement potential as @xmath22 in   the quark confinement potential was taken to be @xmath23\\,,\\label{conf}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants . in principle",
    "these two constants can differ for three- and five - quark configurations .",
    "@xmath26 denotes the hyperfine interaction between quarks , here we take @xmath26 to be the njl interaction induced one .",
    "the njl interaction between quarks can be described by @xmath27   \\label{njl}\\ ] ] where @xmath28  ( @xmath29 ) are the gell - mann matrices in the flavor @xmath30 space , and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the unit matrix in the three dimensional flavor space . in the nonrelativistic approximation ,",
    "the njl induced quark - quark interaction can be obtained as @xmath33\\ , ,   \\label{insqq}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is an operator which distinguishes the coupling strength between two light quarks @xmath35 , one light and one strange quarks @xmath36 and two strange quarks @xmath37 . in principle , once the @xmath30 breaking effects are taken into account , the three coupling strength should be different .",
    "one may find that the present hyperfine interaction is very similar to the one mediated by goldstone boson exchange , which includes the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons exchange  @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we take the relationship of the three different coupling strength as in  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the constituent masses of the light and strange quarks .",
    "the empirical value for the constituent mass of light quark is in the range @xmath41  mev , and that for strange quark is @xmath42  mev higher than @xmath39 . in the traditional @xmath43 constituent quark model , @xmath39",
    "is often taken to be @xmath44  mev  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "since we take the baryons to be admixtures of three- and five - quark components , in general , the constituent quark mass should be lower than that in the three - quark model . accordingly",
    ", here we take the value @xmath45  mev for the light quarks , and @xmath46  mev for the strange quark .",
    "generally , one can divide the interaction  ( [ insqq ] ) by different spin dependences  @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the tensor term in the quark - quark interaction , the njl - induced hyperfine interaction between quarks @xmath47 should be the following form @xmath48 accordingly , one can obtain the three coupling strength by reproducing the mass splitting between @xmath49 and @xmath50 baryons @xmath51    as discussed in  @xcite , there are two low - lying @xmath0 resonances with negative parity in @xmath52 band within the @xmath43 three - quark model  @xcite , one is with spin @xmath53 , and the other @xmath54 , correspond to the two first orbitally excited states of @xmath55 . and",
    "these two states should be degenerate in a given hyperfine interaction model if the l - s coupling hyperfine interaction is not taken into account .",

    "the non - diagonal term @xmath15 depends on the explicit quark - antiquark pair creation mechanism . in present work , we take the quark - antiquark pair creation mechanism to be the one based on a nonrelativistic reduction of the amplitudes found from the njl interaction",

    "this is because of that on the one hand the instanton - induced hyperfine interaction is very different to the present njl interaction induced one , the most obvious two differences are those firstly the instanton - induced hyperfine interaction can only exist between two quarks whose flavor wave function is antisymmetric , and secondly instanton - induced hyperfine interaction leads to strong mixing between five - quark configurations with light and strange quark - antiquark pairs . and on the other hand the transition matrix elements between three- and five - quark spin @xmath54 states in instanton - induced quark - antiquark pair creation model are larger than present ones .    while in any case , the mixing between three- and five - quark spin @xmath53 @xmath0 states is very small and negligible in ins model , and is @xmath11 in njl model , while both ins and njl induced quark - antiquark pair creation mechanism result in strong mixing between three- and five - quark spin @xmath54 @xmath0 states , and the mixing decreases energy of the lowest spin @xmath54 to lower than that of the lowest spin @xmath53 state .",
