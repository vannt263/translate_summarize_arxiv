    "inflation has been widely considered as a remarkably successful theory in explaining many problems in very early universe , such as the flatness , the horizon and the monopole problem @xcite .",
    "it predicts that the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field were generated to form today s large scale structure@xcite , and these fluctuations fit with current observations of cosmic microwave background very well@xcite .",
    "it is a common viewpoint that eternal inflation@xcite can take place in a variety of inflation models .",
    "especially , with the monomial chaotic inflaton potential , inflation generally becomes eternal in the high energy regime .",
    "eternal inflation is not only important in concept , but also provides a possible realization for the string theory landscape@xcite . there have been an increasing number of papers investigating whether we can measure eternal inflation and calculate probabilities in the multiverse , see references@xcite .",
    "usually , eternal inflation happens when the energy scale of the universe is extremely high .",
    "thus we would like to take into consideration on more fundamental theories in logic , namely , the string theory . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a universal property of string theory , i.e. , noncommutativity of spacetime . by considering the effects of spacetime noncommutativity",
    ", we study the condition for eternal inflation and its implications .",
    "as required by stringy spacetime uncertainty relation@xcite , the physical time @xmath0 and the physical length @xmath1 should satisfy @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a length scale given by the string theory .",
    "there have been a lot of attempts to apply this uncertainty relation into inflationary cosmology , dubbed noncommutative inflation , see ref . @xcite .",
    "more detailed works have been investigated in a number of literature@xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the conception of noncommutative inflation proposed by brandenberger and ho@xcite , and then examine whether eternal inflation takes place with such noncommutativity . note that here we have slightly generalized the discussion in @xcite from power law inflation into a generally quasi - exponential inflationary scenario .    in order to introduce the noncommutativity into the 4-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker universe",
    ", we would like to define another time coordinate @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scale factor and we have assumed a spatially flat universe(@xmath7 ) .",
    "for the quasi - exponential expansion where we have imposed the usual slow roll approximation self - consistently , we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter with the dot represents the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath10 and @xmath11 is an arbitrary parameter for the scale factor at a fixed time",
    ". then the spacetime uncertainty relation takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the comoving radial coordinate .",
    "this can be realized by the commutation relation of spacetime @xmath14_*=il_s^2~,\\ ] ] where the @xmath15-product is defined as @xmath16    based on these considerations , for the fluctuation of the inflaton field @xmath17 , we can derive that the canonical normalized perturbation variable @xmath18 satisfies the equation of motion @xmath19 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath20 defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is an effective scale factor appeared in the dispersion relation between a mode @xmath23 and its energy defined with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath24~,\\ ] ] and @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26    as the scale factor is expanding nearly exponentially , when @xmath27 is not too small compared with @xmath4 we can take the approximate form of @xmath28 as @xmath29 ^ 2~,\\\\ \\label{b- }    & \\beta_k^{-}\\simeq{1\\over 2}a^{-2}(\\tau - l_s^2k)\\simeq { 1\\over    2}\\left[h\\cdot(\\tau - l_s^2k)\\right]^{-2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , because of the relations @xmath30 and the spacetime uncertainty ( [ unc ] ) , there is an initial time @xmath31 for the perturbations to be generated , @xmath32 and the fluctuations are not allowed to exist before @xmath31",
    ".    due to this initial time for the fluctuations , the quantum fluctuations of inflaton in noncommutative environment can be generated inside or outside the hubble radius .",
    "these fluctuations are called uv modes and ir modes respectively . in the uv mode limit ,",
    "the effects of spacetime noncommutativity becomes very weak and hence the evolution of the fluctuations is similar with the commutative case",
    ". therefore the spectrum of uv modes is roughly the same as in the commutative case . while in the ir region",
    ", noncommutativity dominates the behavior of the perturbations , and some familiar pictures will be totally modified . in this paper , we shall use the analysis of noncommutativity mentioned above ( especially the ir region ) to study eternal inflation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we calculate the fluctuations generated outside the horizon and provide the constraint for eternal inflation to exist . in section 3 , we make a conclusion and discuss some other possibilities .",
    "in this section , we investigate the quantum fluctuations generated in noncommutative inflationary era and discuss the condition of eternal inflation . since in the uv case",
    "the noncommutative property only contribute a few corrections on the usual perturbation theory@xcite , the condition for the eternal inflation to happen is basically the same as the commutative one .",
    "therefore , we focus our consideration on the ir case that the quantum fluctuations are generated outside the horizon . at the time the fluctuations start to be generated , the effective scale factor is @xmath33 making use of eq .",
    "( [ b+ ] ) and ( [ b- ] ) , and the fact that the hubble scale is larger than the noncommutativity scale in this case , we get the initial time @xmath31 and the initial scale factor @xmath34 as @xmath35    since the ir modes are generated outside the horizon , it is required that @xmath36 . by using the second relation in eq .",
    "( [ tausol ] ) , we can see that @xmath37 in the ir case .",
    "this verifies the physical picture that @xmath38 should be larger than the noncommutativity scale .",
    "now we calculate the quantum fluctuation in the momentum space @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 is linked to the canonical perturbation @xmath39 by @xmath18 , and when the perturbation begins to be generated the initial @xmath39 was canonically normalized as @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , when @xmath17 is born its amplitude can be given by @xmath41 after that , the fluctuations outside the horizon are nearly frozen . by transforming to the coordinate space",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath42 during one hubble time , and correspondingly the ir quantum fluctuation @xmath43 per e - fold in the noncommutative spacetime is given by @xmath44 note that this result is strongly different from the commutative one @xmath45 . due to this ,",
    "the physics of eternal inflation is greatly modified in the noncommutative case and the condition for eternal inflation to happen needs to be reconsidered .    as usual",
    ", the classical motion of the inflaton during one hubble time takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes @xmath48 . and",
    "as usual , the condition that inflation becomes eternal is roughly @xmath49 , or @xmath50 compared with the eternal inflation condition in the commutative case @xmath51 , the noncommutative eternal inflation is more unlikely to happen .",
    "it is because the quantum fluctuation is generally smaller due to the suppression by the hubble parameter . in the following ,",
    "we shall consider two explicit examples with the chaotic potentials .",
    "firstly , let us consider the model @xmath52 . from the condition ( [ ircon ] ) we can see that the inflation is in the ir region when @xmath53 while in the uv region when @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , the condition that inflation has become eternal in the uv region is @xmath55 interestingly , we note that from ( [ main ] ) the eternal inflation will nicely continue in the ir region if @xmath56 to substitute the well - known value @xmath57@xcite into ( [ m2phi2 ] ) , we obtain the result that eternal inflation is allowed to happen only if @xmath58 .",
    "so we conclude that if inflation has become eternal before entering the ir region , it can continue to be eternal in the ir region .",
    "but the amplitude of fluctuation can not grow to larger values because @xmath43 is now suppressed by a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "this is greatly different from the commutative eternal inflation and may constrain the initial condition space for the eternal inflation . on the other hand , if inflation has not become eternal before entering the ir region , then the inequality ( [ m2phi2 ] ) does not hold . in this case inflation will never become eternal because the quantum fluctuation can not be large enough .     in the noncommutative spacetime .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath60 to be large enough so that eternal inflation can take place in the uv region . in this case",
    ", inflation is eternal in part of the noncommutative uv region and the whole ir region.,width=355 ]    as a second example , consider @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "then similarly , the condition for entering the ir region @xmath63 requires @xmath64 from the inequality ( [ main ] ) , we obtain the condition for inflation to be eternal in the ir region as follow , @xmath65 in order that ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) has overlap and inflation can be eternal in the ir region , we need @xmath66 if ( [ pcond ] ) is satisfied , the noncommutative eternal inflation is allowed to exist in the ir region , and there is an upper bound for the energy density of eternal inflation which arises from ( [ p2 ] ) . since the inflaton field can not climb higher than the bound ( [ p2 ] ) with large probability , this provides a possible initial condition for eternal inflation .",
    "now let us examine whether there is eternal inflation at all in the @xmath62 model above .",
    "for the eternal inflation to take place in the uv region , we again obtain the relation @xmath67 which is the same as the ir region eternal condition ( [ pcond ] ) .",
    "so we get the similar conclusion with the @xmath68 model that if eternal inflation takes place in the uv region , it is allowed to extend into the ir region . on the other hand ,",
    "if inflation can not be eternal in the uv region , unfortunately there will not be any eternal inflation in the whole noncommutative inflationary history . besides , there is an interesting difference between @xmath62 and @xmath69 cases that , in the @xmath62 case noncommutative eternal inflation requires an upper bound on the inflaton while this bound does not exist in the @xmath69 case .",
    "for example , in the @xmath70 model , if we expect eternal inflation to take place , then we need the noncommutative scale @xmath71 . to apply the data @xmath72",
    ", we obtain that this scale is around @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 is just above this scale , the upper bound ( [ p2 ] ) on @xmath75 is around @xmath76 and the corresponding energy density is about @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the limitation from noncommutativity can be much stronger than that from the planck density .",
    "such a string scale can be realized easily if we do certain compactification on a large manifold , which should be common and have a large prior probability in the string landscape .     in the noncommutative spacetime .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath60 to be large enough so that eternal inflation can take place in the uv region . in this case",
    ", inflation is eternal in part of the noncommutative uv region and part of the ir region .",
    "this figure is different from fig .",
    "[ fig : primordial2 ] that eternal inflation can not happen in the green part of ir region where the energy scale is extremely high .",
    ", width=345 ]    on the other hand , such a scale @xmath78 or @xmath79 is considerably higher than the scale for the final 60 e - folds inflation .",
    "so if we can observe the noncommutativity in future cmb experiments@xcite , then eternal inflation is not expected to have happened .",
    "spacetime noncommutativity , predicted by string theory , has become a fundamental principle and been studied in a number of literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this principle brings new physics when applied into inflation theory . in this paper",
    ", we have seen that for the chaotic inflationary potential , the scenario of eternal inflation in noncommutative spacetime is remarkably different from the usual one . if inflation do not become eternal in the uv region , then it can never have happened .",
    "we have also discussed that if eternal inflation happens both in the uv region and the ir region , an initial condition for eternal inflation can be provided or constrained . from the derivation in this paper , we can see that @xmath43 becomes smaller and smaller along the potential when eternal inflation enters ir region .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath69 model the initial condition space is greatly reduced ; while for the @xmath62 model there is an upper bound for @xmath75 explicitly .",
    "eternal inflation can not climb into higher energy regions than this bound .",
    "this provides an initial condition for eternal inflation .",
    "as is discussed in @xcite , initial conditions may be essential for predictions in the multiverse .",
    "the initial condition discussed in this paper provides a possible solution for the initial condition problem and can be used in calculating the eternal inflationary probabilities .    in the derivation made in section 2 ,",
    "we have used the standard method according to a number of calculations for noncommutative and non - eternal inflation in the literature .",
    "however , generally there are several possibilities which may change the results we obtain in this paper .",
    "the simplest possibility is that there is no spacetime noncommutativity at all or the scale of noncommutativity is of the same order as the planck scale .",
    "therefore , the noncommutativity will not alter the picture of the usual eternal inflation .    as another possibility",
    ", the noncommutative field theory may be not precise enough to describe the generation of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this saturation is somewhat similar to that inflationary fluctuations described by the common quantum field theory suffers from the transplanckian problems@xcite . to see this problem in the noncommutative field theory , we note that we have used the relation @xmath80 in the calculations of noncommutative inflation",
    "however , this relation does not hold in theories with certain uv - ir relations while uv - ir relations arise commonly together with noncommutativity .",
    "so there is possibility that the perturbations are generated even if @xmath81 , but it is still an open issue for us to fully understand the physics in this region .    finally , the background geometry may be affected considerably by noncommutativity in the ir region .",
    "however , up to now this case has not been carefully studied even in the non - eternal inflationary regime .",
