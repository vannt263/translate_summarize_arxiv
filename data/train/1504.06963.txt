    "the simplified setup of herman s self - stabilizing algorithm consists of a directed circular graph of @xmath0 elements and @xmath8 tokens put on some of the nodes of the graph .",
    "the vertices represent identical processes connected along the edges . ideally , if the system is in a legitimate state , only one process holds a token in the configuration",
    ". however , errors may occur when the system enters into a multiple token state .",
    "herman s algorithm is a randomized protocol to reach a one - token state after an error , hence the name self - stabilizing .",
    "the method of the algorithm is the following : in every step of the discretely treated time , if a process holds a token then it keeps it with probability @xmath1 or passes it to its directed neighbor ( say , clockwise ) with probability @xmath1 , independently of the other token - passes . if a process kept its token in a step but also receives one then both tokens disappear . by the implementation of the processes , we can guarantee that herman s algorithm starts at a configuration where there are odd number of tokens , hence the mentioned algorithm will eventually yield a one - token state with probability one .",
    "several questions naturally arise about the distribution of the execution time of the self - stabilization , i.e. the hitting time of a one - state configuration , what we will denote by @xmath9 , following the notation of @xcite .",
    "since the complete description of the distribution @xmath10 did not turn out to be a really accessible question , the analysis focused mainly on the derived quantity @xmath11 .",
    "the denominator , herman , proved a bound @xmath12 on @xmath11 in the original paper @xcite , that got repaired to @xmath13 by multiple independent authors @xcite .    to find a tight bound",
    ", it is reasonable to search for the extrema of @xmath11 as a function of the initial configuration of the tokens . assuming that the stabilization starts with 3 tokens , the maximum of @xmath11 is realized on the equidistant starting position of the tokens ( or the closest configuration to that , if @xmath0 is not divisible by 3 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the description of @xmath11 given by @xcite for all the initial configurations with three tokens .",
    "they found an explicit formula for @xmath11 in terms of the `` distances '' of the tokens , where by distance of the tokens @xmath14 and @xmath15 we mean the length of the arc connecting @xmath14 and @xmath15 but avoiding the third token @xmath16 .",
    "given these distances of the tokens @xmath17 ( where necessarily @xmath18 by definition ) , the expectation of @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath19 what clearly has the maximum at the points where @xmath20 are the nearest integers around @xmath21 summing up to @xmath0 . in particular , @xmath22 if @xmath0 is divisible by @xmath3 . in @xcite , it was also conjectured to be the only maximum of @xmath11 considering all the possible initial configuration , not necessarily with three tokens . in this paper",
    "we give a proof of this conjecture .",
    "a way for further investigation of the distribution of @xmath9 would be to show that even @xmath10 has the minimum at the equidistant three - token starting state .",
    "this is really a finer information about @xmath9 since @xmath11 is the sum of @xmath23 s and a tight bound on @xmath11 can be understood as the sum of tight bounds on @xmath23 . in @xcite , an explicit formula was established on @xmath10 assuming that there are three tokens . as a consequence",
    ", they deduced that the minimum of @xmath10 is indeed realized at the equidistant three - token starting state when we consider the three - token initial states .",
    "the next step could be to obtain this theorem with no restriction on the number of tokens .    in the paper",
    ", we first show a bound on another linear combination of @xmath23 s , namely that @xmath24 where @xmath25 , with equality only if we start from the equidistant three - token configuration .",
    "although this is not enough to show that the maximum of @xmath11 is at the mentioned equidistant state but it is another evidence towards the hope that @xmath10 is minimized by the equidistant three - token configuration .",
    "indeed , @xmath26 is also a linear combination of @xmath23 s but with weights @xmath27 instead of @xmath28 s , as in the case of @xmath11 , hence the inequality is now a weighted sum of tight inequalities on @xmath29 ) .    to establish this result",
    ", we first deduce a recursion on the expected evolution of some kind of a potential of the process .",
    "the recursion can also be used to prove similar tight inequalities on several other linear combinations of @xmath23 s if the weights are sufficiently well - behaved .",
    "all such estimations are tight only in the case of the equidistant initial configuration , giving yet another evidence to the general conjecture about @xmath10 . as an example of this method , we prove the case of constant 1 weight , namely , we prove that @xmath30 and that it is maximized only by the equidistant initial configuration .",
    "the used argument is not so combinatorial in its intrinsic nature hence it can be generalized to the case when the tokens take steps by poisson clocks or when the circular graph is replaced by a continuous circle on which the tokens follow the distribution of a brownian motion .",
    "also , the proof of theorem [ thm : weaker theorem ] shows that if there are more than three tokens then the expected growth of the potential is significantly bigger compared to the decrease of @xmath11 and this extra freedom can be used to generalize the statement to @xmath31 for functions what are `` close enough '' to @xmath11 or @xmath32 .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : we first develop the main ideas of the paper then we give the main steps of the proof of the two mentioned theorems postponing some computation .",
    "these technical details and the equation on the evolution of the potential are discussed in the third section .",
    "the authors are thankful to andrzej murawski who drew the attention to the herman protocol conjecture at the first problem solving session of the dimap retreat , in march 2013 .",
    "the key idea of this solution , theorem [ thm : weaker theorem ] and the sketch of the modification leading to theorem [ thm : main theorem ] was explained in the second problem solving session .",
    "another solution of the conjecture using independent techniques is shown in @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the notations but using a bit modified viewpoint on the described process . since the arguments require some symmetry , for our purposes it is better to rotate the base space by @xmath33 after every step counter - clockwise , where @xmath0 stands for the number of nodes .",
    "this slight notational modification have the effect that the number of nodes gets doubled , but half of them is necessarily avoided by the tokens in every step . in the following",
    "we will refer to this @xmath34 as the number of nodes .",
    "moreover , the tokens now move in a symmetrized way : they either go on the clockwise neighboring new node with probability @xmath1 or move in the opposite direction to the counter - clockwise neighbor with probability @xmath1 , all independently .",
    "the ( possibly new ) nodes will be numbered by @xmath35 .",
    "the location of the @xmath36-th token at time @xmath37 is described by the random variable @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 stands for the number of tokens at time @xmath41 , where the tokens are numbered compatible to their ordering on the circle ( but the beginning of the enumeration is arbitrary ) .",
    "generalizing the notation @xmath40 we will write @xmath42 for the ( random ) number of tokens at time @xmath41 for the process starting at the initial state @xmath43 . in particular @xmath44 denotes the number of tokens at state @xmath43 . as in the introduction @xmath45",
    "is the hitting time of a one - token state , i.e. the execution time of the self - stabilizing algorithm .",
    "note that this notion is not affected by the symmetrization of the process . also , we need a notation for the hitting time of a three - token state what will turn out to be a major turning point in the evolution of the process , so @xmath46",
    ". we will refer to the equidistant three - token configuration in this way without elaborating on the cases where @xmath34 is not divisible by @xmath3 .",
    "the final goal of the paper is to prove    @xmath47 with equality if and only if we start from the equidistant three - token state.[thm : main theorem ]    to verify this bound , it seems natural not only to keep count on when the process terminated but to have a way to measure `` how far '' we are from the end in expectation .",
    "then the goal becomes to show that the this measure is the worst ( i.e. the highest ) through the whole process if and only if the initial state is the equidistant three - token state .",
    "so we define a `` potential '' that grows from zero to one as the process gets closer to its final state .",
    "we will denote the first such potential by @xmath48 what is defined in an obvious way : assign to a state @xmath43 the expected value of the remaining time until it terminates , and rescale it into @xmath49 $ ] : @xmath50 for all state @xmath43 .",
    "by @xcite , if @xmath43 is a configuration with three tokens , then @xmath48 gets the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the `` distances '' between the three tokens at state @xmath43 , i.e. the number of nodes on the arcs connecting two tokens while avoiding the third .",
    "( note that this formula is obtained in the non - symmetrized setup hence it counts only the original nodes ; with the new nodes @xmath52 show be @xmath55 . )",
    "the main idea of the proof is to introduce a new `` potential '' @xmath56 $ ] , so something that measures how far our state is from the final state in expectation , whose growth speed can be estimated without trying to compute the original @xmath48 potential for all the configurations with arbitrary number of tokens , what would not seem a doable quest .    in the definition of @xmath57 we will use the complex exponential function @xmath58 .",
    "the purpose of it is just avoiding a new notation for the function which assigns the corresponding unit vector to the nodes , when the ring is embedded into the complex plane .",
    "however , this notation also contains implicitly an identification of the plane with the complex plane ( what identification in principle got chosen when we numbered the nodes ) . in other words , we secretly chose a fixed direction what we should not totally forget about .",
    "let @xmath43 be an arbitrary state and assume that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the position of the @xmath36th token of the state @xmath43 using counter - clockwise enumeration of the tokens starting at direction @xmath61",
    ". then the potential @xmath57 is defined as    @xmath62 if the node @xmath0 is not between @xmath63 and @xmath64 then we first re - enumerate the tokens to fit the assumption .",
    "we will see in proposition [ prop : properties of psi w proof ] that neither the choice of the direction , nor the re - enumeration of the vectors affect @xmath65 , even though the summands separately depend on those .",
    "geometrically , @xmath66 can be described as summing up the ( directed ) angle bisectors of the vectors @xmath67 ( maybe after renumbering ) and the fixed unit vector @xmath28 with an extra twist : for odd @xmath36 we reflect the resulting angle bisector vector to the origin .",
    "informally , this reflection is applied to stabilize the quantity under the disappearance of two colliding tokens .",
    "formally , it means that if @xmath68 then deleting these two tokens from the vector @xmath43 will not change the value of @xmath65 .",
    "also the alternating sign is responsible for the independence of @xmath57 to the choice of the direction .",
    "these issues are discussed in details in the appendix , but we state here the properties of @xmath57 we plan to use in this section :    _ _ , title=\"fig:\",width=302]_,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] _    for any state @xmath43 we have [ prop : properties of psi w / o proof ]    1 .",
    "the choice that we made at the identification of the plane with @xmath69 does not affect @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , @xmath65 is invariant under the simultaneous translation of @xmath60 s , even if during the translation , a token jumps over @xmath61 .",
    "the disappearance of two token when they meet do not affect @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath70 , with equality if and only if there is only one token at state @xmath43 .",
    "4 .   @xmath71 , with equality if and only if @xmath43 is the equidistant ( not necessarily three - token ) configuration .",
    "now , we fix the initial state @xmath43 of the process",
    "let us denote by @xmath73 the value of the potential defined above on the random process at time @xmath41 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath74 is described by the following lemma :    for all @xmath75 the following holds:[lem : recursion ] @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the standard filtration of the process , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the number of tokens at time @xmath41 .",
    "this lemma is proved in the appendix , although it is a crucial step toward the theorem . to apply this formula ,",
    "the first idea is to iterate this recursion under expectation .",
    "the following theorem shows the result of this approach :    for @xmath25 the following holds @xmath80 with equality if and only if we start from the equidistant three - token configuration.[thm : weaker theorem ]    note that this statement is a tight inequality with the sum of @xmath81 s with the weights @xmath27 on the left hand side .",
    "fix a time @xmath75 and expand @xmath82 using lemma [ lem : recursion ] : @xmath83 here , we may collect the times @xmath84 with the same @xmath85 . note that in the following sum the index `` runs backwards in time '' what may disturb the reader s visualization of the computations .",
    "@xmath86 where @xmath84 runs only up to @xmath87 . to write the second sum in a compact form",
    ", we introduce the ( maximized ) hitting times of the @xmath88-token states as follows : @xmath89 for all odd @xmath88 . for simpler notations",
    ", we will write @xmath90 for even @xmath88 and @xmath91 . clearly , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . this way , the second expectation gets the form @xmath94 where the latter sum is in fact telescopic since @xmath95 yielding @xmath96 now , collecting the terms by the exponents of @xmath97 gives @xmath98 @xmath99 so we got a formula for @xmath100 , although it is not closed .",
    "however , we can rearrange the expression to estimate @xmath101 as follows : @xmath102 @xmath103    the right hand side of the resulting inequality does not depend on @xmath41 , hence , if we take the ( non - decreasing ) limit in @xmath41 under the expectation on the left hand side , then the inequality remains valid .",
    "this proved the first part of the statement .",
    "for the equality case , note that we used estimations only in the last step so the case of equality holds exactly if we did not lose anything at this estimation .",
    "namely , it is equivalent to @xmath104 and @xmath105 for all @xmath106 .",
    "the latter equality means @xmath107 so we are in a three - token configuration , and the first one  by lemma [ prop : properties of psi w proof ]  is equivalent to the assumption that the tokens are distributed equidistantly , proving the statement .    as we mentioned in the introduction @xmath108",
    "is not in an obvious relation with @xmath11 so we need to essentially modify the argument above to deduce theorem [ thm : main theorem ] .",
    "the nontrivial problem in the background is that the potential @xmath57 does not grow fast enough in conditional expectation if there are three tokens , but it does if there are more .",
    "so the idea of the correction is to change the potential at the ( random ) moment when we enter a three - token state .",
    "in fact , we will return to the original potential @xmath48 what already worked well in the three - tokens states , i.e. it is computable then .",
    "going back to lemma [ lem : recursion ] , we would like the conclude a relation for the expected change of the potential after one step , if we still have at least @xmath109 tokens . in formulas , we need the following :    @xmath110 with equality if and only if @xmath111.[cor : recursion ]    first observe that lemma [ lem : recursion ] implies @xmath112 since @xmath113 on the event @xmath114 and @xmath115 by proposition [ prop : properties of psi w / o proof ] .",
    "so we can apply the usual argument to get a bound on @xmath116 : @xmath117 we can take the expectation of it , where interchanging @xmath118 with the sum is possible since @xmath119\\ ] ] so we have can apply lebesgue s theorem . hence , @xmath120 where we apply the law of total expectation : @xmath121 by the estimation described in the beginning of the proof , we get @xmath122 as we stated .",
    "this lower bound will be enough to prove that no initial configuration can yield slower growth ( in expected value ) of @xmath123 than the equidistant three - token configuration until we reach a three - token state .",
    "the problems is still that such an estimation does not work on @xmath124 ( there we would get 2 instead of 4 ) when we have only three tokens and @xmath123 may slow down .",
    "so to solve this , as we mentioned , we have to switch back to @xmath48 from @xmath57 at the hitting time of a state with three tokens since the expectation of @xmath48 grows `` fast enough '' after @xmath125 as we will see . the second problem is whether the mentioned shift of potentials can carried out without major loss in expectation .",
    "if it can then we can conclude that ",
    "starting from any initial configuration  this mixed potential grows at least as fast as the potential of the process starting at the equidistant three - token configuration .    to establish a relation of the two potentials we will need the following lemma , which is proved in the appendix :    for any state @xmath43 with three tokens the following inequality holds : @xmath126 for some @xmath54 where @xmath127.[lem : interchange of potentials ]    now , the main theorem follows assuming this lemma .    _",
    "( of theorem [ thm : main theorem ] ) _ first , let s investigate what happens to the potential @xmath48 at the moment of the potential - interchange : @xmath128 hence , taking expectation gives @xmath129 so now , we can estimate @xmath130 as : @xmath131 where we can apply lemma [ lem : interchange of potentials ] : @xmath132 so we can use the estimation of @xmath116 proved in corollary [ cor : recursion ] : @xmath133 where we can use the value of @xmath134 if @xmath135 since @xmath136 .",
    "hence , we can continue as @xmath137 by @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , we got the inequality part of the statement . to see the case of equality , note that in the last inequality we estimated from below @xmath139 by zero and @xmath140 by zero as well .",
    "if we did not lose anything here then @xmath141 hence we start from a three - token state and also @xmath142 hence we started from the equidistant configuration by [ prop : properties of psi w / o proof ] .",
    "in this section , we will establish the technical lemmas on @xmath57 , its expected evolution and its relation to the original potential @xmath48 .      1 .",
    "the choice that we made at the identification of the plane with @xmath69 does not affect @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , @xmath65 is invariant under the simultaneous translation of @xmath60 s , even if during the translation , a token jumps over @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   the disappearance of two token when they meet do not affect @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   @xmath70 , with equality if and only if there is only one token at state @xmath43 .",
    "4 .   @xmath71 , with equality if and only if @xmath43 is the equidistant ( not necessarily three - token ) configuration .",
    "thanks to first statement , we may always assume that in a fixed step , the node @xmath28 is not involved and the tokens are enumerated in increasing order starting at the node @xmath28 , hence the computations in the previous section are completely valid .    for the first statement , note that a @xmath143 rotation of the choice of @xmath61 corresponds to a multiplication of every vector by a length 1 complex number .",
    "assuming that @xmath144 implies @xmath145 i.e. no token jumps over the edge @xmath34@xmath28 , it will not change @xmath65 since @xmath146 where @xmath147 stands for the renumbered sequence .",
    "so it is enough to consider the case when @xmath148 , @xmath149 and we rotate the nodes and vectors by the angle @xmath150 i.e. by one token so that @xmath151 . that rotation changes two things : the way we have to enumerate the tokens and also the way we count @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , the numbering is shifted by one and @xmath152 is now @xmath28 not @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 verifying the first statement .    the second statement is clear , since if @xmath68 then they represent the same vector contributing to the sum with different signs so their sum is zero : @xmath157 and the change of the enumeration ( every index after @xmath158 decreases by @xmath159 ) will not change anything because @xmath160 .    to prove the third statement",
    ", we may assume  by the first part  that the last token @xmath161 so the corresponding unit vector is the base direction @xmath61 .",
    "then we can pair the remaining @xmath162 tokens so that the sum of the corresponding vectors can be expressed as @xmath163 where each @xmath164 can be pictured as the the vector starting at the the end - point of the angle bisector unit vector @xmath165 and ending at the endpoint of @xmath166 so it is a chord of the unit - circle . by that picture , it is clear that the sum of several directed chords on a half - circle plus the vector @xmath167 will not sum up to vector longer than @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , the sum of their projection to any line in the plane is has length at most 1 what is equivalent to having length at most 1 .",
    "the case of equality means that there is a projection such that it has length 1 in one direction but since the chords must not meet ( since @xmath168 for all @xmath36 ) and also no angle bisector can end at @xmath169 , it is possible only if that projection is on a horizontal line , so there is no token besides the one on the node @xmath34 .",
    "the inequality in the fourth statement is obvious by @xmath170 and the case of equality can be investigated by the same geometric argument as in the third statement .",
    "namely , it is the zero vector if and only if all of its projections are zero .",
    "first , we investigate what happens to the corresponding angle bisector @xmath172 of one token at a step .",
    "let us use the notation @xmath173 for the step of @xmath174 at the @xmath41-th moment",
    ". then we can decompose the corresponding unit vector as follows :      note that the resulting terms get simplified under conditional expectation : on one hand , @xmath176 since @xmath177 moreover , @xmath178 by the independence of @xmath179 and @xmath180 . on the other hand , @xmath181 does not depend on @xmath180 since @xmath180 has values in @xmath182 so @xmath183 therefore , we can compute the growth of @xmath74 after a step : to expand the @xmath184 we use the notation @xmath185 for the ordinary euclidean scalar product on the plane . hence , we can write : @xmath186 @xmath187 where most of the terms of this sum cancels out since @xmath188 @xmath189 by the independence of @xmath180 s and the asymmetry of @xmath190 . while the other terms get the form @xmath191 @xmath192 by again the independence of @xmath180 s and @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath194 @xmath195 as we stated .",
