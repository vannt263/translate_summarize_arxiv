    "cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 is a ce - based intermetallic compound with quite unique properties .",
    "it is ferromagnetic while most of the other ce - based compounds are antiferromagnetic .",
    "the easy axis is in the basal plane of the hexagonal structure and the saturation magnetization 0.4 @xmath5 is strongly reduced compared to free cerium ion value ( 2.14 @xmath5 ) .",
    "more striking is its huge curie temperature , @xmath4=115 k , that is two orders of magnitude higher that what would be expected from applying the de gennes scaling to gdrh@xmath0b@xmath1 ( @xmath4=90 k ) @xcite .",
    "different theoretical models from itinerant to localized magnetism have been proposed to explain the peculiarities of this compound and they are reviewed in the recent calculations @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is certainly the very short ce - ce distance ( 3.08 @xmath6 ) along the @xmath2-axis that leads to the proposition of strong interatomic ce-4@xmath7-ce-5@xmath8 hybridization or even direct ce-4@xmath7-ce-4@xmath7 interaction @xcite .",
    "while initially itinerant magnetism was favoured , many experimental results point toward localized 4@xmath7 electrons with strong hybridization as inferred from photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , nmr @xcite dhva measurements @xcite .",
    "polarized neutron diffraction and crystal field spectroscopy give an evidence of a mixing of @xmath3=5/2 and @xmath3=7/2 multiplets in the ground state wave - function @xcite .",
    "compton scattering experiments @xcite show that the orbital to spin moment ratio is less than the expected value for ce@xmath9 ion .",
    "hence the spin magnetism is enhanced in cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 with respect to the orbital part and this could explain partly the high curie temperature since exchange interactions couple spins . these overall features together with the strong recent interest for other @xmath7 electron ferromagnetic systems , namely the new uranium based ferromagnetic superconductors @xcite , motivated us to investigate the spin dynamics of cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that no trace of superconductivity was detected when ferromagnetism is suppressed at 7 gpa @xcite in cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 while superconductivity is known to exist in ce(rh@xmath10ru@xmath11)@xmath0b@xmath1 for 0.62 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath12 1 and ferromagnetism disappears for @xmath13 @xmath14 0.16 @xcite .",
    "experiments were carried out on the three axis spectrometers in12 , in22 , in20 and in8 at institut laue langevin , grenoble . the configuration of each spectrometer is given in table 1 .",
    "for all configurations , a fixed final energy was used together with a focusing analyzer without collimation . except for in8 where measurements were performed around ( 0 , 0 , 2 ) ,",
    "most measurements were carried out around the very weak nuclear reflection ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) in order to limit the contamination by acoustic phonons .",
    "the single crystal was grown by the czochralski method by using isotopically enriched @xmath15b ( 90 % ) in order to reduce neutron absorption .",
    "the sample for neutron scattering consists of two co - aligned platelets with [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] normal .",
    "their thickness is 2 mm in order to reduce the effect of rh neutron absorption .",

    "the line is a linear fit going through the origin.,width=302 ]    preliminary data concerning paramagnetic scattering obtained on powder sample were shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "a quasielastic signal was observed with a powdered average linewidth of 2 mev at 150 k and 5 mev at 300 k. figure 5 shows representative spectra taken in the present single crystal study at 120 k just above @xmath4 for three wave - vectors , which establishes the @xmath16 dependence of the signal .",
    "the data are analyzed with a quasielastic lorentzian lineshape convoluted with one dimensional resolution in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "this analysis gives two parameters , the @xmath17-dependent susceptibility @xmath19 and the relaxation rate @xmath20 . in this work ,",
    "the probed fluctuations are in - plane fluctuations since the wave - vector has predominant component along the @xmath2-axis ( being ( h , 0 , 1 ) or ( 0 , 0 1+l ) ) and neutron probes fluctuations perpendicular to @xmath21 .",
    "the obtained relaxation rate is shown in figure 6 at 120 k and for [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] and [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] and for a few points at 150 k along [ 1 , 0 , 0 ]",
    ". the obtained values are qualitatively consistent with the powder averaged ones since the basal plane has more spectral weight than the @xmath2-axis direction .",
    "the extent in @xmath18 space of these excitations is smaller than that of the spin wave for the [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] direction and quite similar for the [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] direction .",
    "it seems that the relaxation rate extrapolates to zero for @xmath17=0 .",
    "however this is not expected since the in - plane magnetization is not a conserved quantity in a planar magnet @xcite .",
    "hence a small finite value @xmath22 may exist but our data do not allow us to extract it .",
    "we fit the data obtained along the [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] direction at 120 k with either @xmath23=@xmath24 or @xmath25 that corresponds respectively to localized or itinerant model of ferromagnetism . along",
    "[ 1 , 0 , 0 ] , we obtained @xmath26= 19(3 ) and @xmath27= 1.34(14 ) ( solid line in fig.6 ) and respectively @xmath28=9.9(9 ) mev.(r.l.u.)@xmath29 and @xmath30=0.6(1 ) r.l.u .",
    "( dotted line in fig.6 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath27 is close to 3/2 , the dynamical exponent expected for an x - y magnet @xcite .",
    "the fit along the [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] direction is not exploited due to the limited number of data points .",
    "usually the ratio @xmath31 can give some information on the nature of the magnetism i.e. localized versus itinerant .",
    "it is expected that @xmath32 @xmath33 1 for itinerant magnetism and that @xmath32 @xmath34 1 for localized magnetism @xcite .",
    "this classification was applied for isotropic cubic magnets @xcite or more recently in orthorhombic uge@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is highly questionable to apply it here since the value of @xmath26 is quite different between the plane and the @xmath2-axis ( see fig .",
    "we could nevertheless notice that the powder averaged value of the relaxation rate @xcite leads to @xmath32 @xmath12 1 that is in favor of localized magnetism .",
    "this conclusion is also sustained by the value of @xmath30 obtained by the itinerant model fit of @xmath20 that is quite large for a temperature just above the curie temperature and this analysis seems therefore unphysical .",
    "hence our limited set of data obtained in the paramagnetic phase would suggest localized magnetism .",
    "finally as compared to antiferromagnetic heavy fermion systems where @xmath35 is constant , it is worthwhile to point out that here @xmath35 is almost linear in @xmath36 for the [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] direction at 120 k for which data were extensively taken ( see fig .",
    "this emphases the peculiarity of ferromagnetic fluctuations and the almost conserved magnetization . in the ferromagnetic compound uge@xmath1 ,",
    "it was found that @xmath35 is linear with a large finite intercept at @xmath37=0 @xcite .",
    "constant energy scans performed for an energy transfer of 3 mev are shown in figure 8 for 120 and 200 k for [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] and [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] directions .",
    "the peak width is very anisotropic between the basal plane where peaks from adjacent brillouin zones overlap and the @xmath2-axis where peaks are narrow .",
    "the constant energy scans can be fit by lorentzian or gaussian lineshape and both fits provide almost the same width @xmath38 .",
    "this is not the true inverse correlation length @xmath30 since the measurement is performed for a finite energy of 3 mev while @xmath30 is obtained by energy integrated imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility .",
    "the gaussian fit gives @xmath39}$]=0.33(1 ) r.l.u .",
    ", @xmath40}$]=0.065(4 ) at 120 k and @xmath39}$]=0.38(5 ) , @xmath40}$]=0.100(8 ) at 200 k. the temperature dependence of this characteristic length is more important along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "this could explain the above mentioned fact concerning the extent in @xmath41 space of the fluctuations .",
    "the change of this extension along [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] between the paramagnetic and ordered phase could be due to a stronger temperature dependence of the different parameters in this direction .",
    "exploiting further the paramagnetic scattering would need a detailed survey of the spin dynamics in the ( @xmath16,@xmath18 ) space above @xmath4 .     and [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] directions .",
    "solid lines are fit to the data with gaussians as explained in the text .",
    "the dashed line indicates the background.,width=302 ]",
    "in this section , we give an estimate of @xmath42 beyond the fit performed in section iii that only gave the constraint 2@xmath43 @xmath12 20 mev and 2@xmath44 @xmath34 2500 . knowing that @xmath45 , it is tempting to describe the system as a set of weakly coupled ferromagnetic chains @xcite . in such a model @xmath46 and",
    "three dimensional order occurs for @xmath47 for 6 neighboring chains @xcite .",
    "however here our spin wave data show that 2s@xmath42 @xmath12 20 mev . knowing that 2@xmath48 @xmath49 1 from compton scattering , we deduce that @xmath42 is not much stronger than @xmath4 and the weakly coupled ferromagnetic chains model is therefore not valid here . for the purpose of an estimate",
    ", we therefore use the usual mean field approximation in its crude formulation , @xmath50 , since @xmath42 is the dominant coupling ( in such a case , the exact formula is @xmath51 ) .",
    "this leads to the following order of magnitudes : @xmath42 @xmath34 10 mev , @xmath52 @xmath34 250 mev and @xmath53 @xmath34 0.02 mev .",
    "this is to be compared to the value of the out of plane anisotropy infered from the latest xas results , @xmath52 @xmath34 50 mev @xcite .",
    "the origin of the x - y nature of the system is the strong crystal field anisotropy .",
    "the dispersion relation given in formula ( 1 ) was used for exchange dominated planar ferromagnets like tb @xcite with in this case the use of total angular momentum @xmath3 instead of @xmath48 . in such a case ,",
    "the anisotropy gaps are expressed as @xmath52=6@xmath54 and @xmath53=36@xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the canonical coefficients of the crystal field hamiltonian when expressed with the stevens formalism @xcite .",
    "we can not use this formulation for cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 since for ce@xmath9 with a total momentum @xmath3=5/2 ground state , the coefficient @xmath58 is zero . as stated above , the gap at @xmath37=0 is a strong indication that in plane anisotropy exists . for ce@xmath9",
    "this is impossible with @xmath3=5/2 .",
    "hence the multiplet @xmath3=7/2 has to be taken into account in the ground state wavefunction .",
    "this mixing between @xmath3=5/2 and @xmath3=5/2 in the ground state was first pointed out by the form factor measurements @xcite . concerning the anisotropy in the plane , one of the reported magnetization measurements at 2 k found a difference of 0.004 @xmath5 for the saturated magnetization between @xmath28 and @xmath59 axis @xcite .",
    "however this result was not reproduced by another group that also reports possible sample disorientation issue in the aforementioned work @xcite .",
    "the small value of @xmath53 that we proposed here implies that its signature will only occur at very low temperature probably much below 2 k.",
    "in the present paper , we have focused on the magnetic interactions in cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 while previous neutron scattering studies focused on single - site crystal - field contributions .",
    "usually rare - earth compounds are classified into exchange dominated or crystal field dominated systems @xcite .",
    "this classification is clearly not valid for cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 where all energy scales must be taken into account in the ground state and low - lying excitations : spin - orbit , crystal field and exchange . while our study does not answer the question of the microscopic origin of the strong curie temperature , we clearly establish the huge anisotropy between the exchange along the @xmath2-axis and in the plane as well as the anisotropy within the plane that precludes a description of the magnetism in term of @xmath3=5/2 only .",
    "the spin - wave spectra extending presumably up to 80 mev at the @xmath2-axis zone boundary has the highest energy for any known cerium compound .",
    "this huge value is clearly a combination of crystal field anisotropy ( @xmath52 ) and exchange ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the present work is aiming to stimulate further theoretical studies that would be able to treat on the same footing all the aspects ( spin - orbit , crystal field and exchange ) of the intriguing magnetism of cerh@xmath0b@xmath1 .",
    "in a neutron scattering experiment , the measured intensity is the convolution of the resolution function and the scattering function @xmath60 .",
    "this latter function is related to the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath61 via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath62 . in this paper",
    ", we use for the paramagnetic scattering ( fig.1a , fig.2 , fig.5 ) , a `` quasielastic lorentzian '' : @xmath63 for the spectra measured at @xmath21=(0 , 0 , 1 ) ( fig.1b ) , we use the following form , that was named `` inelastic lorentzian '' in the paper : @xmath64\\ ] ] this form is phenomenologically used to reproduce the broadening of the peak .",
    "the origin of this anomalous shape is presumably the steep dispersion along the @xmath2-axis that is picked up by the finite resolution function .",
    "this effect is strongest at the minimum of the dispersion . for the spin wave spectra at finite @xmath17",
    ", we use a gaussian for @xmath60 both for the constant @xmath21 ( fig.2 ) and constant @xmath18 ( fig.3 ) scans , i.e for @xmath13=h , l or @xmath18 .",
