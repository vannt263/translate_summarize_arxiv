    "at energies above a few  @xmath0ev , which we will refer to as the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) regime , protons propagating in the galaxy retain most of their initial direction .",
    "provided that the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) is negligible , uhe protons will therefore allow us to probe into the nature and properties of their cosmic sources .",
    "however , due to quite steep cr power spectrum , uhecrs are extremely rare ( a few particles km@xmath1 century@xmath2 ) and their detection calls for the prolonged use of instruments with huge collecting areas . one further constraint arises from an effect first pointed out by greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin  @xcite and since then known as gzk effect : at energies @xmath3 ev the opacity of the interstellar space to protons drastically increases due to the photo - meson interaction process @xmath4 which takes place on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons . in other words , unless the sources are located within a sphere with radius of @xmath5(100 ) mpc , the proton flux at @xmath3 ev should be greatly suppressed .",
    "however , due to the very limited statistics available in the uhe regime , the experimental detection of the gzk effect has not yet been firmly established .    a detailed knowledge of the uhecr framework is still missing .",
    "only recently , for instance , magnetic fields were included in simulations of large scale structures ( lss )  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the simulations agree in finding that egmfs are mainly localized in galaxy clusters and filaments , while voids should contain only primordial fields .",
    "however , the conclusions of refs .  @xcite and  @xcite are quantitatively rather different and it is at present unclear whether deflections in extragalactic magnetic fields will prevent astronomy even with uhe protons or not .",
    "another large source of uncertainty is our ignorance on the chemical composition of uhecrs , mainly due to the need to extrapolate for decades in energy the models of hadronic interactions , though important progress are expected from new high quality data and deconvolution techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "future accelerator measurements of hadronic cross sections in higher energy ranges will also ameliorate the situation , but this will take several years at least .    from now on , therefore , we shall work under the assumptions that uhe astronomy is possible , namely : i ) proton primaries ; ii ) egmf negligibly small ; iii ) extragalactic astrophysical sources are responsible for uhecrs acceleration . a possibility favoring these hypotheses",
    "is that relatively few , powerful nearby sources are responsible for the uhecrs , and the small scale clustering observed by agasa  @xcite may be a hint in this direction .",
    "however , the above quoted clustering has not yet been confirmed by other experiments with comparable or larger statistics  @xcite , and probably a final answer will come when the pierre auger observatory  @xcite will have collected enough data . independently on the observation of small - scale clustering , one could still look for large scale anisotropies in the data , eventually correlating with some known configuration of astrophysical source candidates . in this context ,",
    "the most natural scenario to be tested is that uhecrs correlate with the luminous matter in the `` local '' universe .",
    "this is particularly expected for candidates like gamma ray bursts ( hosted more likely in star formation regions ) or colliding galaxies , but it s also a sufficiently generic hypothesis to deserve an interest of its own .",
    "to this aim we use the iras pscz  @xcite astronomical catalogue as tracer of large scale structures from which , once that the related selection effects have been taken into account , we derive the related pattern of anisotropies ; we then assess the minimum statistics needed to detect the model against the isotropic null hypothesis , in particular providing a forecast for the auger experiment .",
    "previous attempts to address a similar issue can be found in  @xcite .",
    "further details of the analysis summarized here can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the iras pscz catalogue  @xcite contains about 15.000 galaxies and related redshifts with a well understood completeness function down to @xmath6 ( i.e. down to a redshift which is comparable to the attenuation length introduced by the gzk effect ) and a sky coverage of about 84% .",
    "the incomplete sky coverage is mainly due to the so called zone of avoidance centered on the galactic plane and caused by galactic extinction and to a few , narrow stripes which were not observed with enough sensitivity by the iras satellite ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "these regions are excluded from our analysis with the use of the binary mask available with the pscz catalogue itself . the mask @xmath7 is defined so that @xmath8 if the direction @xmath9 falls respectively inside or outside the blind region .    to correctly employ the catalogue , selection and discreteness systematic effects have to be considered . for the flux selection correction",
    "the relevant quantity to be taken into account is the fraction of galaxies actually observed at the various redshifts , a quantity also known as the _ redshift selection function _",
    "@xmath10 ; given @xmath10 , the quantity @xmath11 represents the experimental distribution corrected for the selection effects , which must be used in the computations .",
    "the discreteness effects ( or `` shot noise '' ) are , instead , minimized using the catalogue only until a maximum redshift of @xmath12 ( corresponding to @xmath13 ) , a fair compromise for which we have still good statistics while keeping the intrinsic statistical fluctuations under control . in any case , due to gzk effect in the energy range @xmath145@xmath0ev ,",
    "the contribution from sources beyond @xmath15 is sub - dominant , thus allowing to assume for the objects beyond @xmath12 an effective isotropic source contribution .",
    "a detailed discussion of the various catalogue issues can be found in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to obtain the underlying probability distribution @xmath16 to have a uhecr with energy higher than @xmath17 from the direction @xmath9 .    for simplicity here",
    "we shall assume that each source of our catalogue has the same probability to emit a uhecr , according to a power law spectrum at the source @xmath18 ; however , both assumpitions can be easily generalized within the same formalism  @xcite .",
    "a suitable expression for the distribution @xmath19 can be easily obtained as @xmath20 that can be effectively seen as if at every source @xmath21 of the catalogue it is assigned a weight @xmath22 that takes into account geometrical effects through the luminosity distance ( @xmath23 ) , selection effects ( @xmath24 ) , and physics of energy losses through the integral in d@xmath17 ; in this  gzk integral \" the upper limit of integration is taken to be infinite , though the result is practically independent on the upper cut used provided it is much larger than 10@xmath25 ev ; the energy losses are taken into account through the code described in  @xcite and parameterized in the function @xmath26 , the  initial energy function \" giving the energy @xmath27 of particle that should be injected at a redshift @xmath28 to reach the earth with an energy @xmath29 .",
    "we choose @xmath30ev that results in a fair compromise between the intensity of the anisotropies ( that increases with energy ) and the achievable statistics ; for this @xmath31 the isotropic contribution to the flux is sub - dominant ; however we can take it exactly into account and the weight of the isotropic part is given by @xmath32 . ) ]    finally , to graphically represent the result , the spike - like map of eq .",
    "( [ spikemap ] ) is effectively smoothed through a gaussian filter with beamwidth @xmath33 .",
    "given the extremely poor statistics available in uhecr astrophysics , we limit ourselves to address the basic issue of determining the minimum number of events needed to significatively reject `` the null hypothesis '' .",
    "to this purpose , it is well known that a @xmath34-test is an extremely good estimator and has no ambiguity due to the 2-dimensional nature of the problem respect to the k - s test or the smirnov - cramer - von mises test .",
    "a criterion guiding in the choice of the bin size is the following : with @xmath35 uhecrs events available and @xmath36 bins , one would expect @xmath37 events per bin ; to allow a reliable application of the @xmath34-test , one has to impose @xmath38",
    ". each cell should then cover at least a solid angle of @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the solid angle accessible to the experiment . for @xmath41 ( 50% of full sky coverage ) , one estimates a square window of side @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 for 100 events , @xmath44 for 1000 events .",
    "since the former number is of the order of present world statistics , and the latter is the achievement expected by auger in a few years of operations , a binning in windows of size @xmath45 represents quite a reasonable choice for our forecast .",
    "this choice is also suggested by the typical size of the observable structures , as can be seen in the next section .",
    "notice that the gmf , that induces at these energies typical deflections of about @xmath46 @xcite , can be safely neglected for this kind of analysis .",
    "the same remark holds for the angular resolution of the experiment .    moreover , for a specific experimental set - up one must include the proper exposure @xmath47 , that has to be convolved with the previously found @xmath48 .",
    "we properly parameterize and take into account the auger exposure @xmath49 as function of declination @xmath50  @xcite : contour plots in galactic coordinates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : refframe ] .     galactic coordinate reference frame and",
    "contours enclosing 68% , 95% and 99% of the auger exposure function , with the corresponding declinations .",
    "the celestial equator ( @xmath51 ) and south pole ( @xmath52 ) are also shown.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for a given experiment and catalogue , the null hypothesis we want to test is that the events observed are sampled  apart from a trivial geometrical factor  according to the distribution @xmath53 .",
    "since we are performing a forecast analysis , we will consider test realizations of @xmath35 events sampled according to a random distribution on the ( accessible ) sphere , i.e. according to @xmath54 , and determine the confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "with which the hypothesis is rejected as a function of @xmath35 . for each realization of @xmath35 events",
    "we calculate the two functions @xmath55)^2}{\\epsilon_i[f_{\\rm iso}]},\\\\ { \\cal x}_{\\rm lss}^2(n)=\\frac{1}{m-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\frac{(o_i-\\epsilon_i[f_{\\rm lss}])^2}{\\epsilon_i[f_{\\rm lss}]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the number of  random \" counts in the @xmath57-th bin @xmath58 , and @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] are the theoretically expected number of events in @xmath58 respectively for the lss and isotropic distribution .",
    "the mock data set is then sampled @xmath61 times in order to establish empirically the distributions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the resulting distribution is studied as function of @xmath35 ( plus eventually @xmath64 , etc . ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : arraymapsecut ] we plot the smoothed maps in galactic coordinates of the expected integrated flux of uhecrs above the energy threshold @xmath65ev and for slope parameter @xmath66 ; the isotropic part has been taken into account and the ratio of the isotropic to anisotropic part @xmath67 is respectively @xmath68 .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     as check of the method we perform an independent estimate of the power spectrum using the master algorithm @xcite , a method typically employed in similar cmb analysis .",
    "this method is well suited for small scale anisotropies and is quite complementary to the fitting procedure ; we verified that the two spectra superimpose and join smoothly making us confident on the reliability of the result .",
    "uhecrs offer the fascinating possibility to make astronomy with high energy charged particles ; in particular , besides small scale clustering , a large scale anisotropy is expected correlating with the local cosmological lss .",
    "however , we showed with a @xmath34 approach that a huge statistics of several hundreds data is required to start testing the model at auger south .",
    "untill now , the lack of uhecr statistics has seriously limited the usefulness of such a kind of analysis .",
    "however , progresses are expected in forthcoming years",
    ". the southern site of auger is already taking data and , once completed , the total area covered will be of 3000 km@xmath69 , thus improving by one order of magnitude present statistics in a couple of years  @xcite . the idea to build a northern auger site strongly depends on the possibility to perform uhecr astronomy , for which full sky coverage is of primary importance . to this aim",
    ", the japanese - american telescope array in the desert of utah is expected to become operational by 2007  @xcite offering almost an order of magnitude larger aperture per year than agasa in the northern sky .",
