    "it is commonly believed that adding information about the morphology of galaxies may help in the estimation of photometric redshifts ( photo - zs ) when using training set methods .",
    "most of this work in recent years has utilized the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) many groups have attempted to use a number of derived primary and secondary isophotal shape estimates in the sloan digital sky survey imaging catalog to help in estimating photo - zs .",
    "some examples include ; using the radius containing 50% and/or 90% of the @xcite flux in the sdss r band ( denoted as petror50_r petror90_r in the sdss catalog ) , concentration index ( ci = petror90_r / petror50_r ) , surface brightness , axial ratios and radial profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently @xcite have attempted to use galaxy shape parameters derived from hubble space telescope / advanced camera for surveys imaging data using a principle components approach and then feeding this information into their neural network code to predict photo - zs , but for samples much deeper than the sdss .",
    "unfortunately they find marginal improvement when using their morphology estimators .",
    "another promising approach focuses on the reddening and inclination of galaxies . @xcite",
    "have attempted to quantify these effects on a galaxy s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the idea is to use this information to correct the over - estimation of photo - zs of disk galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , attempts to morphologically classify large number of galaxies in the universe has gained in accuracy over the past 15 years as better / larger training samples from eye classification has increased .",
    "for example , @xcite was one of the first to use an artificial neural network trained on 830 galaxies classified by the eyes of six different professional astronomers .",
    "in more recent years @xcite has attempted to classify galaxies by morphological type using a neural network approach based on a sample of 1399 galaxies ( from the catalog of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has used a sample of 984 non - star forming sdss early - type galaxies to distinguish between e , s0 and sa galaxies . in the past year two new attempts at morphological classification using machine learning techniques on a galaxy zoo @xcite training sample have been published @xcite .",
    "the @xcite results were impressive in that they claim to obtain classification to better than 90% for three different morphological classes ( spiral , elliptical and point - sources / artifacts ) .",
    "these works are in contrast to previous work like that of @xcite who used a classification scheme based on sdss spectra . however , this classification certainly missed some early - type galaxies from their desired sample due to the presence of star formation .",
    "in this paper we will continue our use of gaussian process regression to calculate photo - zs , using a variety of inputs .",
    "this method has been discussed extensively in two previous papers @xcite .",
    "we utilize the sdss main galaxy sample ( mgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the luminous red galaxy sample ( lrg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the sdss data release seven ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "we also utilize the galaxy zoo 1 survey results ( gz1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the galaxy zoo project @xcite contains a total of 900,000 sdss galaxies with morphological classifications @xcite .",
    "while this study does not focus exclusively on the lrg sample , it should be noted that if it is possible to improve the photo - z estimates for these objects as shown herein it could also improve the estimation of cosmological parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the sdss as well as upcoming surveys such as boss@xcite , bigboss @xcite , and possibly euclid @xcite , not to mention lsst@xcite .",
    "it could also contribute to more reliable photo - z errors , as required for weak - lensing surveys @xcite and baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements , which are also dependent upon accurate photo - z estimation of lrgs @xcite .",
    "all of the data used herein have been obtained via the sdss casjobs server . in order to obtain results consistent with paper",
    "ii for both the mgs and lrg samples we use the same photometric quality flags ( ! bright and ! blended and !",
    "saturated ) and redshift quality ( zconf@xmath10.95 and zwarning=0 ) but using the sdss dr7 instead of earlier sdss releases .",
    "these data are cross - matched in casjobs with columns 1416 in table 2 of @xcite extracting the galaxies flagged as ` spiral ' , ` elliptical ' or ` uncertain ' .",
    "the galaxies  flagged as ` elliptical ' or ` spiral ' require 80 per cent of the vote in that category after the debiasing procedure has been applied ; all other galaxies are flagged ` uncertain ' \" @xcite .",
    "debiasing is the processes of correcting for small biases in spin direction and color .",
    "see section 3.1 in @xcite for more details on debiasing .",
    "note that the gz1 sample is based upon the mgs , but the mgs contains lrgs as well .",
    "this is why we can analyze both of these samples .",
    "however , the actual lrg survey goes fainter than the mgs and so we do not find lrg galaxies fainter than the mgs limit of r@xmath217.77 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details on the mgs and lrg samples .",
    "a number of points from both the lrg and mgs were eliminated because of either bad values ( e.g. -9999 ) or because they were considered outliers from the main distribution of points .",
    "the former offenders included : petror90_i ( 13 points in the mgs sample , 1 point in the lrg ) , me1_i ( 43 points , 5 points ) , petror90err_i ( 7177 points , 1262 points ) , mrrccerr_i ( 22 points , 12 points ) .",
    "the reason for eliminating bad me1_i points is that we use it for calculating ae_i from table 2 of @xcite .",
    "a small number of outliers were also removed from the mgs sample , but totalled only 27 points .",
    "no such outlier points were removed in the lrg sample .",
    "this leaves us with a total of 437,273 mgs and 68,996 lrg objects .",
    "using the gz1 classifications in the mgs there are 45,249 ellipticals , 119,369 spirals and 272,655 uncertain ( @xmath0 62% ) .",
    "for the lrg sample there are 27,227 ellipticals and 13,495 spirals leaving 28,274 uncertain ( @xmath041% ) .",
    "using the morphological classifications from the galaxy zoo project first data release @xcite we attempt to calculate photo - zs for 4 different samples and four combinations of primary and secondary isophotal shape estimates from the sdss as seen in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "a larger variety of input combinations were tried including those in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "however , we only report those found with the lowest root mean square error ( rmse ) in table [ tbl-1 ] of this paper .",

    "[ fig : galzoo7plot4z ] we also show plots of the spectroscopic redshift versus the predicted photometric redshift for the inputs that predict the lowest rmse for each of the four data sets listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "these are more impressive than one might initially guess . in paper ii",
    "we showed how adding additional bandpasses in the ultraviolet via the galaxy evolution explorer(galex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could naively improve photo - z estimation .",
    "the same was shown when using additional bandpasses from the infrared from the two micron all sky survey(2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the results were biased because neither galex or 2mass reach the same magnitude or redshift depth as the full sdss mgs or lrg samples .",
    "it is easier to get lower rmse estimates of photo - z when you have a smaller range of lower redshifts to fit . for the mgs it is clear from the top two panels in figure [ fig : dr7hist ] that the galaxy zoo objects span a similar range of redshifts and r - band magnitudes . on the other hand",
    "the situation for the luminous red galaxies is not as straightforward .",
    "looking at the bottom two panels of figure [ fig : dr7hist ] the large second bump at a redshift of z@xmath00.35 and r@xmath018 does not exist .",
    "the latter is logical because the galaxy zoo catalog was drawn from the mgs and hence there are no galaxies beyond r@xmath317.77 ( see @xcite for details on petrosian magnitudes ) according to their selection criteria @xcite .",
    "our lowest rmse values come from galaxies categorized as ellipticals in the luminous red galaxy sample using the sdss u - g - r - i - z bandpass filters and the isophotal shape estimates from table 2 of @xcite : ci , mrrcc_i , ae_i , mcr4_i , texture_i .",
    "these yield an rmse of only 0.01180 , which we believe is the lowest calculated to date for such a large sample of galaxies measured in the bandpasses of the sdss while also retaining a fairly large range of redshifts ( 0 @xmath4 0.25 ) and dereddened magnitudes ( 12 @xmath5 17.77 ) .    taking a closer look at the kinds of inputs that improve the results by galaxy type",
    "can be interesting .",
    "it is clear from table [ tbl-1 ] that the stokes parameters appear to work better for spiral than elliptical galaxies .",
    "the stokes parameters measure the axis ratio and position angle of galaxies as projected on the sky . in detail",
    "they are flux - weighted second moments of a particular isophote .",
    "@xmath6 when the isophotes are self - similar ellipses one finds @xcite : @xmath7    the semi - major and semi - minor axes are a and b while @xmath8 is the position angle .",
    "@xcite demonstrates the efficacy of using sdss derived axis ratios in characterizing the inclinations of spiral galaxies .",
    "this is seen in table [ tbl-1 ] where they offer the second best set of inputs when determining photometric redshift for spirals .",
    "both stokes q & u parameters also display a larger range of values in the spirals than in the ellipticals .",
    "the standard deviations in stokes q & u for spirals are 0.1877 & 0.1500 while for ellipticals they are 0.0596 & 0.0459 .",
    "hence they clearly offer more room for possible improvement in the former than in the latter .",
    "one of the more surprising results is the difference in using the b inputs for the mgs versus lrg ellipticals . in the latter case",
    "these inputs give the lowest rmse results , while in the mgs elliptical case they give the worst .",
    "this could be do to the fact that the surface brightness of the lrg galaxies are more easily modeled by the b inputs than the mgs .",
    "the mgs ellipticals may still have clumps of star formation that can make the surface brightness more difficult to model than the more passive lrg ellipticals .",
    "when comparing the mgs and lrg spirals one stark difference is clear when utilizing the p50 ( petrosian 50% light radius in sdss i band ) and ci ( concentration index = p90/p50 ) inputs shown in table [ tbl-1 ] . in the mgs spiral case",
    "these additional inputs yield worse fits , whereas they are among the most useful in the lrg spiral case .",
    "this may indicate that mgs spirals are more diverse morphologically than lrg spirals .",
    "the p50 and ci inputs are incapable of helping to model the mgs spiral diversity and simply add noise rather than signal to the fits .",
    "@xcite points out that red spirals ( read lrg type ) will `` be dominated by inclined dust reddened spirals , and spirals with large bulges . ''",
    "note that this does not mean that lrg bulge dominated spirals are necessarily s0 galaxies ( which would add to their diversity both morphologically and spectroscopically ) .",
    "@xcite have both shown that contamination of s0s into spirals is only about 3% in the best case scenario .",
    "so again , perhaps p50 and ci can do a better job of modeling lrg spirals because they are less diverse than mgs spirals .",
    "there are several outstanding issues with using this approach for studies that may utilize large samples of sdss lrg derived photo - zs ( e.g. baryonic acoustic oscillations ) .",
    "the first is that the gz1 catalog has only been able to classify ( @xmath059% ) of the lrg galaxies as spiral or elliptical .",
    "this means that 41% of our sample can not benefit from morphology knowledge when estimating photo - zs .",
    "secondly , the lrgs used herein do not go to the same depth ( in redshift or magnitude ) as the full lrg ( r@xmath919 ) catalog since the gz1 is based on the mgs ( r@xmath917.77 ) .",
    "note also that the gz1 morphology estimates get worse as one reaches the fainter end of the sample @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the machine learning derived morphologies of @xcite can only classify up to 90% as accurately as their ` by eye ' gz1 training set .",
    "these constraints will have to be taken into account for any studies that attempt to utilize morphology in photo - z calculations .",
