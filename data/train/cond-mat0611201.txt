    "in the traditional bak  sneppen model @xcite defined on a generic graph @xcite , each of the @xmath0 vertices is regarded as a biological species having a fitness value @xmath1 , initially drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . at each timestep the species with lowest fitness and all its neighbours undergo a mutation , and their fitness values are drawn anew from the same uniform distribution .",
    "the process is iterated , and eventually the system reaches a stationary state , characterized by a step  like fitness distribution , uniform above a threshold @xmath4 .",
    "this behaviour is observed on regular lattices @xcite , random graphs @xcite , small  world @xcite and scale  free @xcite networks , the only dependence on the particular topology being in the value of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 vanishes for scale  free degree distributions with diverging second moment@xcite .",
    "here we couple this dynamical rule with the fitness model assumption @xcite that the network is formed by drawing a link between any two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 with fitness  dependent probability @xmath7 , thus introducing an intrinsic feedback between dynamics and topology . in this way , whenever the fitness @xmath1 of a species @xmath5 is updated to @xmath8 , the links from @xmath5 to all the other vertices @xmath6 are drawn anew with probability @xmath9 . besides the updates described above , one could also define additional and arbitrary _ link updating events_. in other words , in addition to the ` natural ' link update occurring between a mutating species and all other species , other link updates may happen between any two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 at generic and arbitrarily distributed timesteps . when this occurs , the link between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is updated and drawn anew with probability @xmath7 where @xmath1 and @xmath10 are the current fitness values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , even if the latter are not involved in a mutation event .",
    "remarkably , it is possible to show ( see supplementary information ) that the introduction of link updating events leaves the system in the same stationary state as if they were absent .",
    "therefore our model is very general in this respect , and allows for rearrangements of ecological interactions on shorter timescales than those generated by mutations . in particular ,",
    "the stationary state is the same if the _ whole _",
    "network is updated at each timestep . in this case storing the information on the adjacency matrix among species is unnecessary , and we shall exploit this property to achieve fast and very large numerical simulations of the model .    as we show below , the coupling between structure and dynamics leads to unexpected results that can not be traced back to any of the two processes taken as separate .",
    "moreover , another important advantage is that the main limitations of the two models disappear when they are coupled together .",
    "a fundamental problem in the bs model on static graphs is that , after a mutation , the new species always inherits exactly all the links of the previous one .",
    "this is hard to justify , since it is precisely the structure of ecological connections among species which is believed to be both the origin and the outcome of macroevolution @xcite . here",
    "the fitness  driven link updating overcomes this problem .",
    "similarly , the static fitness model requires the specification of an _ ad hoc _ fitness distribution that never changes .",
    "by contrast , here the fitness distribution self  organizes spontaneously to a stationary probability density , removing the need of arbitrary specifications . as we discuss below , a proper interpretation of the fitness also allows us to remove the remaining arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "however , in order to keep our approach as general as possible , we first study the model analytically for a generic form of @xmath11 , and focus on particular choices only later",
    ".    the analytical solution of the model for an arbitrary linking function @xmath12 can be obtained by focusing on the master equation for the fitness distribution @xmath13 at the stationary state ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "we find that the analytical expression for @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath4 is a threshold value determined through the normalization condition @xmath15 , which reads @xmath16 in the infinite size limit @xmath17 , the distribution @xmath18 of the minimum fitness value @xmath19 is uniform between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , while all other values ( except possibly a vanishing fraction ) are above @xmath4 ( see supplementary information ) . in other words , @xmath20 .",
    "this characterizes the stationary state completely .",
    "once @xmath13 is known , all the expected topological quantities can be determined as in the static fitness model @xcite .",
    "for instance , the average degree of a vertex with fitness @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 and the inverse function @xmath23 can be used to obtain the cumulative degree distribution as @xmath24 \\label{eq_pk}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the cumulative fitness distribution . note that if @xmath4 is nonzero the fitness distribution preserves the discontinuous behaviour displayed on static networks @xcite . however , here we find the novel feature that @xmath13 is in general not uniform for @xmath26 .",
    "this unexpected result holds for any nontrivial choice of @xmath12 , and hence for any topology .",
    "therefore the effect is not due to the topology itself , but to the interplay between the topological evolution and the dynamical process entangled with it .",
    "remarkably , this feedback alone determines the self  organization of the system from a random structure to a complex network with nontrivial dynamical and topological properties .",
    "the above analytical solution holds for any form of @xmath12 .",
    "now we consider possible choices of this function .",
    "first note that the null choice is @xmath27 , the network being a random graph .",
    "it is nonetheless an instructive simple case , and we briefly discuss it . moreover , this choice is asymptotically equivalent to the random neighbour variant @xcite of the bs model , the average degree of each vertex being @xmath28 ( we drop terms of order @xmath29 from now on ) .",
    "our analytical results read @xmath30 and , depending on how @xmath31 scales with @xmath0 , eq.([eq_norm ] ) implies @xmath32 we note that these three dynamical regimes are tightly related to an underlying topological phase transition .",
    "as @xmath31 decreases , the whole system splits up into a number of smaller subsets or _",
    "clusters_. such process displays a critical behaviour near the threshold @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "below @xmath34 , each node is isolated or linked to a small number of peers . above @xmath34 ,",
    "a large giant component emerges including a number of nodes of order @xmath35 , whose fraction tends to @xmath3 as @xmath36 .",
    "this explains the dynamical regimes in eq.([eq_tau0 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath37 ( dense regime ) , then @xmath38 and @xmath13 is uniform between @xmath2 and @xmath3 as in the initial state , since an infinite number @xmath39 of fitnesses is continuously udpated as on a complete graph . in this case , the step  like behaviour is destroyed .",
    "if @xmath40 with finite @xmath41 ( sparse regime ) , then @xmath4 remains finite as @xmath17 , and this is the case considered in ref.@xcite that we recover correctly .",
    "finally , if @xmath31 falls faster than @xmath29 the graph is below the percolation threshold ( subcritical regime ) : the updates can not propagate and @xmath42 , as for @xmath0 isolated vertices ( only the minimum is continuously updated , which after many timesteps results in pushing all fitness values , except the newly replaced one , towards @xmath3 )",
    ". therefore the dynamical transition is rooted in an underlying topological phase transition .",
    "this previously unrecognized property is fundamental and , as we show below , is also general .",
    "a nontrivial form of @xmath12 must be chosen carefully . on static or fitness  independent networks @xmath1",
    "is usually interpreted as the _ fitness barrier _ against further mutation , and the links are interpreted as feeding relations @xcite . however , once the topology depends on @xmath21 these two interpretations are difficult to concile .",
    "the coupling we have introduced requires consistent interpretations of @xmath21 and of the links .",
    "also , the form of @xmath12 must be consistent with the feature that the updates of @xmath21 propagate through the network determined by it .",
    "this very instructive aspect must characterize any model with coupled topology and dynamics , and reduces significantly the arbirariness introduced in the static case . here",
    "we suggest that the simplest self  consistent interpretation is the following .",
    "since there is no external world in the model , the environment experienced by a species is simply the set of its ecological interactions .",
    "now let @xmath1 represent the fitness ( rather than the barrier ) of @xmath5 , and let a link between two species mean ` being fit to coexist with each other ' ( i.e. it represents an undirected , non  feeding interaction beneficial to both ) .",
    "the more a species is connected to other species , the more it is fit to the environment .",
    "this picture is self  consistent provided that the larger @xmath21 and @xmath43 , the larger @xmath12 . following the results of refs.@xcite , the simplest unbiased @xcite choice for such a function is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a positive parameter controlling the number of links .",
    "this choice generates a network with a nonrandom , fitness dependent expected degree sequence @xcite , which in this case is not known a priori and will be determined by the fitness distribution at the stationary state .",
    "all other higher  order properties are completely random , except for the structural correlations induced by the degree sequence @xcite .",
    "it therefore represents the fitness ",
    "dependent version of the so  called _ configuration model _ @xcite . as we show later on , structural correlations have an important impact on the dynamics . with the above choice",
    ", @xmath13 can be directly computed analytically through eq.([eq_rho2 ] ) .",
    "however we write it in a different form , which is equivalent when @xmath17 , in order to solve also more complicated integrals involving it later on .",
    "we use the trick @xmath46 where the angular brackets denote an average over the distribution @xmath18 of the minimum fitness , that is @xmath47 . as we show in a moment , when @xmath17 this approximated expression becomes exact",
    ". then eq.([eq_rho2 ] ) yields @xmath48 where @xmath4 is the solution of eq.([eq_norm ] ) , which reads @xmath49 if @xmath45 remains finite as @xmath17 , or in other words if @xmath50 , then the trivial solution is @xmath38 . on the other hand , we find @xmath51 if @xmath52 remains finite as @xmath17 . to obtain the value of @xmath4 in this case ,",
    "note that for a nonzero solution the term @xmath53 in the above expression is finite and negligible for @xmath0 large enough .",
    "multiplying both sides by @xmath45 yields @xmath54 whose solution is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the productlog function defined as the solution of @xmath57 . putting these results together , we have @xmath58    as for random graphs , we find a marked transition as the scaling of @xmath45 changes from @xmath59 to more rapidly decaying .",
    "this suggests an analogous underlying percolation transition .",
    "as we show below , this is indeed the case .",
    "we can therefore still refer to the subcritical , sparse and dense regimes .",
    "note that as @xmath17 we have @xmath60 in the sparse and subcritical regimes since @xmath61 , which implies that we can neglect @xmath62 in the denominator of eq.([fermi ] ) .",
    "therefore the expression @xmath63 is exact . on the other hand , in the dense regime we have @xmath38 , which again implies the same expression since @xmath18 becomes the dirac delta function @xmath64 .",
    "therefore our trick to use the above expression turns out to be exact in all regimes for @xmath17 .",
    "the main panel of fig.[fig_px ] shows the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of the fitness @xmath65 , while the inset shows a plot of @xmath66 .",
    "the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations .    as predicted by eq.([eq_rhofermi ] ) , @xmath13 is the superposition of a uniform distribution and a power  law with exponent @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath26 .",
    "this purely power  law behaviour , that becomes exact in the sparse regime @xmath71 for @xmath17 , results in a logarithmic cdf looking like a straight line in log  linear axes .",
    "note that , despite the value of the exponent , the presence of a nonzero lower threshold ensures that @xmath13 is normalizable .",
    "this mechanism may provide a natural explanation for the onset of pareto distributions with a finite minimum value in real systems .",
    "by contrast , for large @xmath45 the uniform part is nonvanishing and @xmath13 deviates from the purely power  law behaviour .",
    "the decay of @xmath13 for @xmath26 is a completely novel outcome of the extremal dynamics due to the feedback with the topology : now the fittest species at a given time is also the most likely to be connected to the least fit species and to mutate at the following timestep .",
    "being more connected also means being more subject to changes .",
    "this enriches the coexistence patterns displayed on static networks .",
    "we now check the conjectured percolation transition . for different system sizes , we find that the cluster size distribution @xmath72 displays power  law tails when the control parameter @xmath73 approaches a critical value @xmath74 ( corresponding to @xmath75 ) , suggesting the onset of a second  order percolation  like phase transition . as shown in figure [ cluster_size_distribution ] , @xmath76 with @xmath77 at the phase transition . fig .",
    "[ giant_component ] shows that the average fraction of nodes in the largest component remains negligible for @xmath78 , whereas it takes increasing finite values above @xmath79 . as an additional check , following the method adopted in ref.@xcite , we have plotted the average size fraction of non  giant components , which diverges ( in the infinite volume limit ) when @xmath72 decays algebraically as reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ giant_component ] .",
    "even if one of the most studied properties of the bs model on regular lattices is the statistics of avalanches characterizing the soc behaviour @xcite , we do not consider it here .",
    "this is because , as shown in ref.@xcite , when considering long ",
    "range @xcite instead of nearest  neigbour connections , it can lead to a wrong assessment of the soc state , which is put into question by the absence of spatial correlations even in the case that avalanches are power ",
    "law distributed .",
    "rather , we further characterize the topology at the stationary state by considering the degree distribution @xmath80 and the degree correlations . using eq.([eq_kx ] )",
    ", we find that the average degree @xmath81 of a vertex with fitness @xmath21 is @xmath82 similarly , through eq.([eq_pk ] ) we can determine the analytical expression for the cumulative degree distribution @xmath83 . as shown in fig.[fig4 ] , @xmath81 is linear for small @xmath45 since @xmath84 , while for large @xmath45 it saturates to the maximum value @xmath85 .",
    "this implies that in the sparse regime @xmath80 mimics @xmath13 and is characterized by the threshold value @xmath86 and by a power  law decay @xmath87 above it ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "note that here @xmath4 remains finite even if @xmath88 with @xmath89 , in striking contrast with what obtained on static scale  free networks @xcite . differently",
    ", for large @xmath45 the saturation @xmath90 translates into a cut  off that makes @xmath80 deviate from the pure power ",
    "law behavior for @xmath91 . as shown in refs.@xcite , this saturation determines anticorrelation between the degrees of neighboring vertices ( disassortativity ) and a hierarchy of degree ",
    "dependent clustering coefficients as observed in many real  world networks ( this is not shown here for brevity ) .",
    "as @xmath17 , these correlations vanish in the sparse regime ( @xmath92 ) , while they survive in the dense regime ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "structural correlations and a nonzero threshold @xmath4 are then mutually excluding in this model , which is another interesting effect of the feedback we have introduced .",
    "we finally note that with a different choice of @xmath11 , one can have any exponent for the power  law distribution of fitnesses , and therefore for the degree distribution as well .",
    "this makes our model completely flexible in order to reproduce any desired topological property .",
    "our results represent a first step into the unexplored domain of systems with generic self  organized coupling between dynamics and topology . a huge class of such processes needs to be studied in the future , to further understand the unexpected effects of this coupling .",
