    "we connect the two previous topics by proving theorem [ planrg ] and in  [ algsec ] we then describe two different methods , both based on real algebraic geometry , for constructing planar algebras as representations of the planar operad , the first based on algebraic loop spaces and string topology and the other based on a real version of gromov  witten theory .",

    "the composition @xmath46 is then given by gluing a rescaled copy of @xmath44 in place of the interior of the disc @xmath45 , so as to match the shadings and the marked white regions .",
    "this operation is well - defined , with the coloring and choice of white region eliminating any possible rotational ambiguity .",
    "also the result only depends on the isotopy classes .",
    "the planar operad @xmath47 consists of all orientation - preserving diffeomorphism classes of planar k - tangles that fix the boundary @xmath48 .",

    "an example of compositions is given in figure [ figplanopd ] .",
    "in the figures [ figplandiag ] and [ figplanopd ] the black / white coloring and the marked white regions are not shown for simplicity .    ]",
    "one then defines planar algebras ( @xcite , @xcite ) as algebras over the planar operad @xmath47 , in the sense described in @xcite .",
    "this means ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) that a planar algebra @xmath47 is a family of vector spaces @xmath49 together with a morphism @xmath50 from the planar operad @xmath47 to the ( colored ) operad @xmath51 of multilinear maps between vector spaces .",
    "the morphism @xmath52 from the planar operad to the operad of multilinear maps of vector spaces has the following properties .",

    "this is illustrated in one example in figure [ figovals ] , where one encodes a configuration of ovals inside a planar tangle via a rooted tree and computes the corresponding multiplicative factor accordingly .    ]",
    "our main focus in this paper is on a geometric framework for planar algebras based on real algebraic geometry and open string theory .",
    "however , we mention briefly the well known connection between planar algebras and the theory of subfactors of von neumann algebras ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , since , in light of our interpretation of planar algebras it leads naturally to possible constructions of subfactors from data of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry .    in @xcite",
    ", popa showed that one can associate to a subfactor a _ standard invariant _ , which is a planar algebra .",
    "not all planar algebras arise as the standard invariant of a subfactor , but one can characterize those that have this property , as in  4 of @xcite .    a subfactor planar algebra is a planar algebra for which all the vector spaces @xmath63 are finite dimensional , with @xmath64 , and with @xmath65 , which has an involution on each @xmath63 induced by the reflection of tangles with the property that the partition function @xmath50 is a sesquilinear form with respect to this involution . the reconstruction theorem , in the form given in @xcite , shows how to associate to a subfactor planar algebra with @xmath66 a subfactor @xmath67 obtained from a tower of type ii@xmath68 factors @xmath69 , with a faithful tracial state @xmath70 , so that the standard invariant of the subfactor , constructed as in @xcite by considering the relative commutants @xmath71 , gives canonical identifications @xmath72 which induce a morphism of involutive planar algebras .",
    "we first define weighted planar tangles , which are planar tangles with additional decorations , and we use them to distinguish the connected components of the moduli space @xmath3 .    [ weighttangle ] let @xmath32 be a planar tangle as in  [ sectangle ]",
    ". then , @xmath32 is called weighted if each interior string and each boundary segment is decorated with a non - negative integer weight .",
    "a weighted tangle is of weight @xmath23 if the sum of weights for all strings and boundary segments is @xmath23 .",
    "the following statement is a slight generalization of a similar result in @xcite for genus zero covers of @xmath0 .",
    "[ comprgtangles ] there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between the set of connected components of the moduli space @xmath3 and the set of weighted planar tangles .",
    "we associate a tangle to each stable @xmath2-map @xmath73 by simply pulling back the real line @xmath74 by the map @xmath26 , @xmath75    let @xmath76 be the complex double of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the set of critical values of @xmath28 , and let @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote respectively the set of real critical values and its complement . to determine weights , consider an arbitrary point in @xmath80 .",
    "for each string ( or boundary segment ) , we define the function @xmath81 as the number of preimages of @xmath82 lying on this string ( or boundary segment ) .",
    "then the weight of this string ( or boundary segment ) is the minimum of @xmath81 .",
    "note that the weight of a closed string in @xmath14 coincides with the multiplicity of @xmath26 restricted to this string .",
    "we first check that this indeed gives a weighted planar tangle .",
    "since @xmath14 is half of a maximal real curve of genus @xmath6 , it is topologically a disc minus a collection of @xmath6 discs . the preimage @xmath83 gives the strings inside @xmath14 or segments in the boundary of @xmath14 .",
    "we now check the condition that these tangles are expected to satisfy .",
    "these strings intersect only in the boundary @xmath84 of @xmath85 .",
    "we have the following possibilities .    [",
    "[ strings - inside - sigma ] ] _ strings inside @xmath14 _ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if the strings had intersections in @xmath86 , then such an intersection point @xmath87 would be a critical point with real critical value .",
    "hence , the same is also true for the conjugate @xmath88 in the complex double @xmath9 of @xmath14 .",
    "however , this contradicts the genericity condition of @xmath89 ( see defn .  [ stablemmap ] ) .",
    "[ [ strings - and - the - boundary - partial - sigma ] ] _ strings and the boundary @xmath84 _ + +",

    "if @xmath87 is a critical point with a real critical value , then @xmath90 is a critical point with the same critical value .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 , since @xmath28 is generic . for each such critical point",
    ", @xmath92 contains exactly four arcs in @xmath9 incident to it .",
    "two of these arcs are the arcs lying in @xmath93 , while the other two interchange under the involution @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the other endpoints of these two arcs coincide .",
    "next , we need to show that the number of critical points at each boundary component @xmath40 of @xmath14 is even , as required for the data to define a planar tangle .",
    "note that the set of all critical points of the real map @xmath89 consists of an even number of points .",
    "the order of this set is in fact @xmath94 due to the riemann ",
    "hurwitz formula . on the other hand , the real maps @xmath95 degenerate when their critical points collide , in particular when a complex conjugate pair of critical points degenerates to a real point of @xmath8 .",
    "under such a degeneration , it can only split into a pair of real ramification points lying in the same real component @xmath40 . since there exist stable maps",
    "@xmath27 without any real ramification points , we show that the number of critical points is even for each boundary component @xmath40 via a simple induction on these types of degenerations .",
    "we need to show that , for the tangle we associated to elements of a connected component of @xmath3 , the the isotopy class does not change .",
    "it is clear that the isotopy class of these tangles will not change under small perturbations and it can only change through intersections of strings .",
    "as we have already observed above , any intersection of strings violates the genericity condition .",
    "namely , changes of isotopy class of tangles can happen when one passes through the discriminant locus to another component of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , to show that we have a bijection , we then need to show that any arbitary tangle of weight @xmath23 can be obtained in this way . for a given such tangle ,",
    "an element of @xmath96 can be constructed by gluing a set of weighted pairs of pants which is in fact @xmath97 .",
    "the gluing prescription of weighted pants is given in thm 1 in @xcite based on @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath98 the connected component of @xmath3 corresponding to a given weighted tangle @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be a pair of stable @xmath2-maps such that the restriction of @xmath101 to the boundary component @xmath102 agrees with the restriction of @xmath103 onto @xmath104 .",
    "assume that the boundary components @xmath105 and @xmath106 carry opposite orientations .",
    "then we can sew the @xmath2-maps @xmath107 along their boundaries @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 denote the space of pairs described above .",
    "this space is in fact a fiber product in the following way .",
    "recall that the space of _ algebraic loops _ is the space of morphisms @xmath111 .",
    "the moduli spaces @xmath112 admit evaluation maps to @xmath113 , @xmath114 then the space described above is the fibered product @xmath115    the sewing operation described above provides us with a morphism @xmath116    the induced map on the sets of connected components of these spaces defines a corresponding map at the level of weighted tangles , which agrees with the composition of tangles .",
    "there is a similar sewing along the boundary segments which fits better with the example that we discuss in  [ tlsec ] below .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be a pair of stable @xmath2-maps such that the restriction of @xmath101 to the boundary segment @xmath117 agrees with the restriction of @xmath103 onto @xmath118 . if @xmath105 and @xmath106 carry opposite orientations , then we can sew the @xmath2-maps @xmath107 along their boundary segments @xmath119 for @xmath109 and obtain a new @xmath2-map of degree @xmath120 .",
    "the space of such pairs is also a fiber product .",
    "the appropriate subspaces of the moduli spaces @xmath112 admit evaluation maps to the space of algebraic paths @xmath121 , which is the space of morphisms @xmath122 .",
    "note that this map is not defined for all components @xmath98 of @xmath123 since the tangles @xmath32 in general need not have boundary segments ( _ e.g. _  if there is no critical point on a boundary component of @xmath14 , then it can only map into the algebraic loop space as above ) .",
    "then , by using the appropriate subspaces of @xmath123 , we obtain the space of such pairs as a fiber product similar to the above construction ( [ sewcompose ] ) .",
    "let @xmath24 be in @xmath124 and let @xmath44 be the closed string which is the common boundary of a pair of weighted pants @xmath125 in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath126 and @xmath127 be the sets of boundaries of @xmath128 , and @xmath129 respectively . let the @xmath130 be the weights of @xmath40 and @xmath131 be the weight of @xmath44 .",
    "we first note that the deformations of such a pair of weighted pants and their maps to @xmath0 are given by the fiber product @xmath132 which is determined by the evaluation map @xmath133 .",
    "as we have already seen above , there is a morphism of this product into the moduli space @xmath134 .",
    "this map in fact removes the string @xmath44 in @xmath14 _ i.e. , _  it provides the trace operator in geometric terms in the above setting .",
    "this map is given by the gluing of a pair of weighted pants @xmath128 and @xmath129 as in  @xcite .",
    "we can define an involution @xmath135 by replacing the complex structure @xmath136 of @xmath14 by @xmath137 .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing @xmath14 with the other half @xmath138 of @xmath9 .",
    "this operation reverses the orientations of the strings and checkerboard shadings of the corresponding planar tangle .",
    "the collection of connected components of @xmath3 provides a topological operad @xmath139 .",
    "the following statement then follows directly from the discussion of the previous subsections .",
    "the operad of ( weighted ) planar tangles is the topological operad @xmath139 .",
    "consider the moduli space @xmath140 of @xmath2-maps of genus zero .",
    "such @xmath2-maps have @xmath141 critical points . then , the tangles that distinguish the components @xmath98 of @xmath140 are the planar tangles on a disc with @xmath37 points on their boundaries where @xmath142 . in other words ,",
    "these tangles connect the first @xmath31 points starting at the marked critical point in @xmath14 to the second @xmath31 points without having any crossings .",
    "these are in fact the tangles that generate the temperley - lieb algebras ( modulo the trace ) .",
    "for instance , if we consider the case with @xmath143 , we obtain the tangles that generate @xmath144 and @xmath145 ; see figure [ tl3 ] for the bases of @xmath145 .",
    "[ tl3 ] ]    the product of two such tangles is obtained by sewing the boundary segments between the @xmath31th and the @xmath37th point of the first tangle and the @xmath146st and the @xmath31th point of the second tangle .",
    "figure [ tlproduct ] illustrates an example of a such a composition of tangles .     and",
    "@xmath32 [ tlproduct ] ]     there is an equivalent description of temperley - lieb algebras by using the moduli space of @xmath2-maps of genus one . in this case , one needs to consider the tangles in a cylinder @xmath14 , and the composition is given by sewing the boundary components .",
    "however , the numbers of critical points at each boundary of the cylinder need not be equal . therefore , either one has to consider a more general algebra ( which contains temperley - lieb algebra as a subalgebra ) or one needs to restrict oneself to a subspace of @xmath147 that contains only those components @xmath98 that correspond to the tangles of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "in this section , we discuss two possible geometric constructions of algebras over the planar operad @xmath47 .",
    "the first one follows closely the approach of cohen and godin s in contrucing string topology operations @xcite .",
    "the second one is in the spirit of gromov - witten theory @xcite , in the real algebraic geometry setting ( see for instance @xcite ) .      as we have already observed in  [ sec_sewing ] ,",
    "the moduli space @xmath3 admits evaluation maps @xmath148 by using these evaluations , we can pull back classes from @xmath149 . note",
    "that , like the usual topological loop space @xmath150 , the algebraic loop space @xmath151 has infinitely many connected components , each determined by the degree of the loops . however , in contrast to the topological case , the components of @xmath151 are finite dimensional and are not contractible .",
    "therefore they carry nontrivial cohomology classes .",
    "let @xmath155 be a basis for @xmath156 and let @xmath157 be the intersection form .",

    "if the closed string bounds a disc ( rather than a more complicated weighted pant ) , then it plays the role of trace , and it is given as in .      an alternative way to obtain representations of @xmath47 is to use ideas from gromov - witten theory of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a tangle having at least one marked point at each boundary disc . in this case ,",
    "the evalution map @xmath162 maps @xmath24 to its critical values in @xmath0 .",
    "the image of the evalution map is the space of @xmath163-equivariant distinct ( unordered ) point configurations in @xmath0 which we denote by @xmath164 .",
    "moreover , if we restrict ourselves to the specified critical points at each boundary component , the evalution map takes its values in the configuration space of ordered point configurations @xmath165 .",
    "let @xmath166 and @xmath167 we then define correlators by setting @xmath168 these take values in the cohomology with compact support @xmath154 of the component @xmath124 corresponding to the tangle @xmath32 .",
    "then , by using the same idea as in ( [ eqn_g_product ] ) , we define the higher products corresponding to the tangles @xmath32 , which depend on the classes @xmath169 , by setting @xmath170 here @xmath171 is the intersection matrix of @xmath172 .",
    "the composition of these higher products and the trace operators are evident and are given as in the previous case described in  [ sec_str_top ]     the requirement on the existence of marked points may seem artificial , but at present we do not have a convenient substitute for it . however , the above setting",
