    "network motifs provide an approach to understand and characterise the behaviour of living systems at genomic , metabolic and ecological scales  @xcite .",
    "food - webs , defined as a subset or module of larger , more complex networks , are used to analyse ecological interactions at the community or population level , as first described by mathematicians such as lotka and volterra , and have been widely used to explore phenomena observed at both macro- and micro - scales  @xcite .",
    "+ mathematical modelling of ecological interactions is affected by the model objective ( e.g. , observation , prediction , control ) , the availability of existing knowledge and data , and the structural complexity necessary to adequately describe the motif . for clarity , we define _ motif _ here to be analogous to interaction _ modules _ described by population ecologists , and the specific forms of these motifs are described widely in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "+ the software presented here focuses on a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions and , specifically , their analysis and simulation for two or three microbial species and associated substrates and products .",
    "the motif models are developed as systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) used to describe the dynamics of and interactions between the individual organisms and their various components .",
    "+ mathematical analysis of such model structures is commonplace in fields such as chemostat theory  @xcite , predator - prey system analysis  @xcite , theoretical microbial ecology  @xcite , and more recently in application to synthetic microbiology  @xcite .",
    "methods that include steady - state analysis and basin of attraction characterisation are necessary to understand the stability , resilience and persistence of the modelled microbial populations . however",
    ", performing these analyses robustly requires a relatively high degree of competency with mathematical theory of dynamical systems .",
    "there are several tools available for the numerical analysis of dynamical odes .",
    "these include    xppaut    @xcite , which is compiled in c , and    matcont    @xcite , a continuation software available for    matlab    .",
    "however , whilst versatile , these tools are difficult for non - specialists to use without a background in modelling or mathematics . furthermore , for use in systems with more than four odes , bifurcation and stability analysis is often problematic as finding exact solutions for higher - dimensional systems is non - trivial and often intractable .",
    "+ we present here an analysis software ,    mi - sim    , specifically for microbial communities .",
    "it provides a user - friendly environment in which microbiologists , microbial ecologists and biological mathematicians can rapidly and robustly characterise the dynamics of ecological motifs of up to three microbial species , without the requirement to develop their own code , construct models or have a detailed knowledge of the mathematics of dynamical systems analysis .",
    "foremost , we aimed to develop a tool that enables users to model and analyse their own species interactions by making the software as generic as possible . here , we have taken six common ecological motifs describing interactions between two distinct species , plus one extended motif that consists of three interacting species .",
    "the seven motifs , described in table  [ motifs ] , are simple networks commonly observed at both micro- and macro - scales , and provide a theoretical basis by which scientists can test hypotheses in suitably sized community networks  @xcite .",
    ".description of ecological motifs available in the software .",
    "a negative interaction indicates a cost to the species , a positive interaction signifies the species gains a benefit and @xmath0 is a neutral interaction . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ jreg ]        mi - sim    employs a number of algorithms that may be computationally expensive .",
    "this can be an issue in    matlab    , especially when nested loops are used .",
    "we have attempted to overcome performance concerns by using vectorisation instead of loops wherever possible and by making use of    matlab    specific commands such as _ matlabfunction _ for handling symbolic manipulation . in the case where loops are unavoidable , increasing the resolution of the output by specifying larger numbers of calculation points will significantly impact performance .",
    "this is most relevant for higher - dimensional models , such as the three - tiered motif we include in the software .",
    "this is a challenging system to solve using    matlab    , so we employ    mupad    , which has a powerful symbolic engine that can solve complex systems of odes to generate all possible solutions . in    matlab",
    ", the solutions may be incomplete and overriding the constraints for such systems results in failure .",
    "the    mupad    option is computationally costly , but once solutions are found , subsequent analysis can be parallelised to significantly improve performance .",
    "the current version of    mi - sim    allows for the analysis of seven motifs comprised of two or three species , described by up to six odes .",
    "theoretically ,    matlab    can solve higher - dimensional systems of odes numerically , but this is dependent on the memory available to the cpu .",
    "for stiff problems , ode solvers allocate memory for solution vectors of length @xmath1 and a jacobian matrix of size @xmath2 .",
    "it is recommended to use the _ jacobian _ solver option for these cases .",
    "the restriction to systems of six odes or less is necessary to ensure that the software will run on most standard cpus , however experienced modellers may wish to test the algorithms with larger models .",
    "future development of the software will aim to allow users to enter their equations manually via the interface and automatically configure the parameter , variable and solver options accordingly .",
    "further , greater access to solver options and dimension reduction techniques may overcome some of the memory limitations of    mi - sim    .",
    "mi - sim    has been developed in    matlab    ( r2015a , version 8.5.0 ) and tested on both r2016a and r2016b . in order to facilitate the use of the software and to motivate its further development , the    mi - sim    package and documentation",
    "have been released at http://mi-sim.github.io .",
    "the software is also available for direct download on the mathworks file exchange at http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55492-mi-sim .",
    "we have developed the    matlab    based software tool    mi - sim    for numerical analysis of ecological interactions .",
    "the tool is built on a system of odes encompassing three to six dimensions .",
    "mi - sim    allows for the rigorous analysis of a range of standard two species interaction motifs as well as an extended motif of three species . as well as profiling of the basic dynamics of the motif for a given set of parameters",
    ",    mi - sim    also provides the capability to analyse the system in a two - dimensional parameter space to enable investigation of system properties such as existence and stability of steady - states and bifurcation trajectories . in cases where the motif contains multi - stable regions ,",
    "the basin of attraction tool is useful in understanding the role of the initial conditions on the ultimate equilibrium condition .",
    "future releases of    mi - sim    will include the possibility of including user - defined motifs for analysis , as well as a sensitivity analysis tool to explore the effect of parameter uncertainty on the behaviour and properties of the system .",
    "the data provided here can be generated directly from open - access the software provided with this article .",
    "this work was funded by the biotechnology and biological sciences research council uk ( bb / k003240/2 engineering synthetic microbial communities for biomethane production ) and by the institute of sustainability , newcastle university .",
