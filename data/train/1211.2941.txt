    "in @xcite the first author introduced a countable family of _ @xmath0-sequences of points _ in @xmath1 , whose construction strongly depends on the _ @xmath0-sequences of partitions _ of @xmath1 introduced in the same article .",
    "actually , the former are obtained by reordering the left endpoints of the intervals of the latter .    in this paper",
    "we make the first step in the direction of their generalization to higher dimension , presenting two possible extensions to dimension @xmath2 : the _ @xmath0-point sets  la van der corput _ , and the _ @xmath0-sequences  la halton_.    the interest on low discrepancy sequences of points in dimension two or higher is motivated by their application in quasi - monte carlo methods ( see @xcite ) .    in this section",
    "we recall the definition of the _ @xmath0-sequences of partitions _ and _ points _ and their main properties .",
    "the _ @xmath0-sequences of partitions _ are obtained as a particular case of the _ @xmath3-refinements _ introduced by the third author in @xcite .    [ 1 ] consider any non trivial finite partition @xmath3 of @xmath1 .",
    "the _ @xmath3-refinement _ of a partition @xmath4 of @xmath1 ( which will be denoted by @xmath5 ) is obtained by subdividing only the interval(s ) of @xmath4 having maximal length homotetically to @xmath3 .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the @xmath3-refinement of @xmath7 , and by @xmath8 the sequence of successive _",
    "@xmath3-refinements_.    if @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the trivial partition of @xmath1 , the sequence of successive @xmath3-refinements is actually the splitting procedure introduced by kakutani @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it has been proved that the sequence @xmath11 is _ uniformly distributed _ , which means that if @xmath12 , the sequence satisfies @xmath13 for every pair of real numbers @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( see @xcite for the first formal definition of this concept ) .",
    "an _ @xmath0-sequence of partitions _",
    ", denoted by @xmath16 , is obtained as successive @xmath17-refinements of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the partition made by @xmath20 long intervals having length @xmath21 followed by @xmath22 short ones having length @xmath23 , and @xmath21 is the positive root of the equation @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that each partition @xmath25 has only long intervals having length @xmath26 and short ones having length @xmath27 .",
    "the sequence @xmath28 of the number of intervals of @xmath16 satisfies the difference equation @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in @xcite it has been proved that when @xmath32 the _ @xmath0-sequence of partitions _ @xmath33 has _ low discrepancy _ , namely there exists a constant @xmath34 depending on @xmath20 and @xmath22 such that @xmath35 for any @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the _ discrepancy _ of @xmath25 defined by    @xmath38    in fact , we have more generally    [ 2 ] if @xmath39 there exist @xmath40 such that @xmath41 for any @xmath42 .    if @xmath43 there exist @xmath44 such that @xmath45 for any @xmath42 .    if @xmath46 there exist @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for any @xmath42 , where @xmath49 .",
    "in @xcite the first author ( improving @xcite ) introduced an algorithm which associates to each _ @xmath0-sequence of partitions _ a sequence ( of points ) , called _",
    "@xmath0-sequence of points _ and denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "the sequences @xmath50 can be seen in terms of the representation in base @xmath51 of a suitable subsequence of natural numbers .",
    "we describe briefly this construction ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "any positive integer can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( here @xmath56 denotes the integer part , as usual ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath57 the infinite set of all positive integers @xmath36 , ordered by magnitude , such that , for each @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "define on @xmath57 the function    @xmath60    where @xmath61 if @xmath62 , while @xmath63 if @xmath64 .",
    "the sequence @xmath65 defined on @xmath66 is the _ @xmath0-sequence of points_.    the most important property these sequences show is that whenever the _ @xmath0-sequence of points _ has low discrepancy , the corresponding _ @xmath0-sequence of points _",
    "obtained by the algorithm described above has low discrepancy too .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite upper bounds for their discrepancy have been given ( see @xcite for the general theory on uniform distribution and discrepancy ) .    [ 3 ]    if @xmath39 there exists @xmath67 such that for any @xmath68 we have @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath43 there exists @xmath70 such that for any @xmath68 we have @xmath71 .    if @xmath46 there exists @xmath72 such that for any @xmath68 we have @xmath73 , where @xmath49",
    "in this section we see how the _ @xmath0-sequences of points _ can be used to produce sequences in the unit square .",
    "one possibility is to imitate the van der corput idea @xcite , combining an _ @xmath0-sequence of points _ with the points ( ordered by magnitude ) associated to the knapowski partition @xmath74 of order @xmath75 .",
    "hammersely @xcite extended this definition to higher dimension .",
    "the other possibility is to put on the two coordinates two different _ @xmath0-sequences of points _ , imitating what halton did in @xcite when he paired two van der corput sequences having different bases .",
    "he proved that whenever these bases are coprime , the sequence has low discrepancy in the unit square .",
    "halton proved that two van der corput sequences generate a uniformly distributed sequence in the square if and only if they have coprime bases .",
    "the situation is not clear at all if we use pairs of _ @xmath0-sequences of points _ , as it can be seen in figures 1 and 2 , where numerical experiments suggest that there is no uniform distribution , while figures 3 and 4 suggest that for those pairs of _ @xmath0-sequences of points _ we do have uniform distribution .",
