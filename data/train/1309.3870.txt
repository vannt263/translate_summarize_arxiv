    "the cubic graphs constructed in @xcite are not cyclically 4-edge connected and bondy , see @xcite , conjectured that the shortness coefficient for cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs is non - zero .",
    "a much stronger conjecture was made by thomassen @xcite who conjectured that every 4-connected line graph is hamiltonian . for line graphs of cubic graphs",
    "this conjecture is equivalent to saying that every cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graph has a dominating cycle , in the sense that every edge has at least one endpoint on the cycle .",
    "the latter property had been conjectured separately by ash and jackson @xcite , and for the subclass of non-3-edge colourable cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs by fleischner @xcite .",
    "these conjectures would imply that the shortness coefficient for cyclically 4-edge cubic graphs is at least @xmath14 . for planar cubic graphs this",
    "is known to hold by a theorem of tutte @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a survey of these conjectures and their relationship to several other , in many cases equivalent , conjectures .",
    "going in the other direction , i.e.  bounding the circumference from above , several authors have proven that different classes of planar cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs have shortness coefficient less than 1 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the lowest explicit such bound we are aware of is that from @xcite which gives a class with shortness coefficient @xmath15 .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to improve the upper bound on @xmath3 . in the next section",
    "we discuss the circumference for graphs given by a simple construction and in the following section we give two explicit examples which demonstrate that @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the graphs in our example families are also snarks , i.e.  cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs of girth at least 5 which are not 3-edge colourable",
    ". one measure of the degree of non - colourability for a cubic graph is its oddness , i.e.  the minimum number of odd cycles in any 2-factor of the graph .",
    "all snarks on @xmath23 vertices have oddness 2 @xcite but it is known that there are families of snarks with an oddness which is linear in the number of vertices @xmath0 . in @xcite families of snarks with oddness at least @xmath24 were constructed , for certain sequences of @xmath0 and in @xcite this was improved to @xmath25 .",
    "our second construction matches this bound and we point out a second way of constructing snarks with the same oddness growth .    in the last section we discuss a property related to the dominating cycle conjecture and we conjecture that our bounds can be improved to show that in fact @xmath26 .",
    "the following general type of construction has been used to construct graph families with various desired properties , in particular the construction in @xcite showing that the shortness exponent of 3-edge connected cubic graphs is less than 1 was of this form .",

    "we denote any substitution of @xmath27 into @xmath28 using a specified edge @xmath36 of @xmath27 by @xmath37    note that given @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath36 there are typically many non - isomorphic graphs of the form @xmath37 , since given neighbouring vertices @xmath33 and @xmath38 we have not specified which vertices in @xmath39 and @xmath40 the corresponding edge connect .",
    "the following lemma is easy to prove    [ lem1 ] if @xmath27 is cubic and cyclically @xmath11-edge connected and @xmath28 is @xmath11-regular and @xmath11-edge connected then @xmath37 is a cyclically @xmath11-edge connected cubic graph",
    ".    next we note that under the contraction used in point 1 of definition [ contr ] a cycle @xmath41 in @xmath37 will be transformed into an eulerian subgraph @xmath42 of @xmath28 .",

    "let @xmath13 be given by a substitution as in lemma [ lem1 ] , with @xmath43 , and @xmath42 be an eulerian subgraph of @xmath28 .",

    "recall that a transition in an eulerian trail is a pair of consecutive edges in the trail .",
    "the observations above mean that at vertex a @xmath33 of @xmath42 there is always at least 1 and 4 allowed transitions through @xmath33 , depending on the degree , and by kotzig s theorem on eulerian trails with forbidden transitions @xcite there is an eulerian trail in @xmath42 which is compatible with these allowed transitions . in @xmath13",
    "this trail corresponds to a cycle with length equal to the sum of the lengths of the paths inside the @xmath32s .",
    "this lemma can be generalized to larger even values of @xmath11 in a straight forward way , now deleting more than two vertices from @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath11 is odd , and at least 5 , we can use a theorem of catlin , see @xcite , together with @xcite to conclude that @xmath13 has a spanning eulerian subgraph and then use the same arguments as for a uniform even @xmath11 on this subgraph .    from these lemmas",
    "we see that we can always find a cycle in @xmath37 which contains vertices from each @xmath32 , and the maximum possible length of such a cycle will primarily depend on the properties of @xmath27 , rather than those of @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath28 is hamiltonian we could take @xmath42 to be a hamiltonian cycle , and hence only use a single path in each @xmath32 . from @xcite",
    "we know that for each @xmath12 there are @xmath11-regular @xmath11-edge connected graphs on @xmath0 vertices with circumference less than @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , however if @xmath28 is of this type we will be able to use a general eulerian subgraph @xmath42 instead of a cycle . as a corollary we get ,    for any fixed @xmath27 and sequence of graphs @xmath56 the shortness coefficient for the class of cyclically 4-edge connected substitutions",
    "@xmath57 is strictly greater than 0 .",
    "we will here give two families of cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs which give improved upper bounds on the shortness coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "we let @xmath58 be a sequence of 4-regular 4-edge connected graphs .    in each of these examples we will need some facts regarding the maximum length of a cycle either including or excluding certain vertices or edges .",
    "these facts can be ascertained by hand , however this analysis is lengthy and not particularly enlightening so here we instead state these facts based on computational tests done using mathematica .",
    "this was done by finding all cycles in these graphs and then testing the stated properties .",
    "let @xmath59 be the graph in figure [ fig1 ] , @xmath36 the edge marked in the figure , and @xmath60 .",
    "we will prove that @xmath61    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig1 ]    let us consider what the restriction of a cycle in @xmath62 to an @xmath39 can look like .    1 .",
    "the first possibility is that the restriction is a single path .",
    "this corresponds to two different possibilities in @xmath59 1 .   a cycle including the edge @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath59 this cycle has at most 19 vertices .",
    "2 .   a cycle using one endpoint of @xmath36 but not the other . for @xmath59",
    "this cycle has at most 18 vertices .",
    "the second possibility is that the restriction is two paths .",
    "this corresponds to two different possibilities in @xmath59 1 .   a cycle including both endpoints of @xmath36 but not the edge @xmath36 .",

    "2 .   two disjoint cycles each using one endpoint of @xmath36 . for @xmath59",
    "these cycles together have at most 18 vertices .    from this",
    "we conclude that @xmath63 will have @xmath64 vertices and the longest cycle in @xmath65 will have at most @xmath66 vertices , hence giving us the claimed bound for the shortness coefficient .",
    "let @xmath67 be the graph in figure [ fig2 ] , let @xmath36 be the edge marked in the figure , and @xmath68 .",
    "we now prove that @xmath69    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig2 ]    enumerating the way the intersection between a cycle and @xmath39 as before we get the following lengths    1 .   1 .   for @xmath67",
    "this cycle has at most 26 vertices .",
    "2 .   for @xmath67",
    "this cycle has at most 25 vertices .",

    "this cycle has at most 26 vertices .",
    "2 .   for @xmath67",
    "these cycles together have at most 25 vertices .    from this",
    "we conclude that @xmath70 will have @xmath71 vertices and the longest cycle in @xmath70 will have at most @xmath72 vertices , hence giving us the claimed bound for the shortness coefficient .",
    "the graph @xmath59 is a snark and every 2-factor of @xmath59 contains an odd cycle which includes no vertex from @xmath36 .",
    "hence every 2-factor of @xmath63 will have at least @xmath73 odd cycles .",
    "this means that @xmath63 is also a snark and has oddness at least @xmath73 .",
    "in fact since the oddness is an even number the oddness will be at least @xmath74 if @xmath73 is odd .",
    "thus the bound for the shortness coefficient applies to the snarks as well .",
    "the graph @xmath67 is also a snark and every 2-factor of @xmath67 contains two odd cycles which include no vertex from @xmath36 .",
    "hence every 2-factor of @xmath70 will have at least @xmath75 odd cycles .",
    "this means that @xmath70 is also a snark and has oddness at least @xmath75 .",
    "constructing snarks with a high oddness is an interesting problem in itself .",
    "see @xcite for the best current bounds on ratio between the oddness and number of vertices for snarks of different cyclic connectivities .",
    "we note that apart from the 28 vertex snark @xmath67 there is a second snark @xmath76 on 28 vertices , shown in figure [ fig3 ] , which has an edge @xmath36 , marked in the figure , such that every 2-factor has two odd cycles which include no vertex from @xmath36 .",
    "hence this snark can be used in a substitution construction to get a second family of snarks with the same oddness ratio as @xmath77 . however , for this snark the substitution construction does not yield graphs with small circumference .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig3 ]    the families @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath78 all contain a large number of graphs , the growth rates for the number of such graphs on @xmath79 vertices will be closely related to that of the number of 4-regular graphs on @xmath80 and @xmath81 vertices respectively .",
    "this means that even though all snarks on @xmath82 vertices have oddness 2 , see @xcite , this will change drastically for larger @xmath79 , with many snarks of larger oddness and a wide spread of oddness values for each @xmath79 .",
    "as we have seen the cycle structure of certain cubic graphs becomes more restricted as the number of vertices grows . in both @xmath59 and @xmath67 there are edges which do not belong to any cycle of the same length as the circumference of the graph , and cycles using both endpoints of these edges are also shorter than the circumference",
    ". as both @xmath67 and @xmath76 demonstrate there are also snarks with edges which do not participate in any of the odd cycles of 2-factors with a minimal number of odd cycles . with regard to the dominating cycle conjectures mentioned in the introduction",
    "we believe that this more rigid behaviour is cause for concern .    in @xcite fleischner and kochol proved that the dominating cycle conjecture for cyclically 4-edge connected graphs is equivalent to the statement that there is a dominating cycle containing any specified pair of edges from the graph .",
    "let us consider the following question : given a matching of size @xmath11 in @xmath13 , is there a dominating cycle containing the matching ?",
    "for @xmath43 the answer is negative for the 8 vertex mbius ladder , which is cyclically 4-edge connected . by using mathematica to find all dominating cycles in the small cyclically 4-edge connected graphs ( the graphs can be obtained from e.g the website of @xcite ) we can make the following observation .",
    "recall that a weak snark is a cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graph which is not 3-edge colourable .    1 .   given a matching @xmath83 of size 3 in any cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graph on @xmath84 vertices",
