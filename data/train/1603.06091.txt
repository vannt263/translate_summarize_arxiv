    "it is well - known that there exist two accelerating expansions in our universe .",
    "one occurs at the very early time of the universe , solving particularly the flatness and horizon problems , called `` inflation ''  @xcite , and the other is at the late - time , indicated by the type - ia supernovae observations  @xcite , called `` dark energy . ''",
    "the former epoch can be realized by introducing the inflaton field with a slow - roll potential . for the latter ,",
    "various theoretical models have been proposed to achieve the late - time acceleration universe  @xcite , while the simplest one is to keep the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , in the gravitational theory , referred to as the @xmath0cdm model . however ,",
    "if @xmath0 is originated from the vacuum energy , it is associated with the planck mass as predicted in particle physics , which is about @xmath1 orders of magnitude larger than the current measured value .",
    "this `` fine - tuning '' or `` hierarchy '' problem in fact was known even before the discovery of dark energy  @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to solve the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "one of the popular ways is the running @xmath0 model , in which the vacuum energy decays to matter  @xcite or a quintessence field  @xcite in the evolution of the universe , and its observational tests have been extensively investigated in the literature  @xcite . in this study , we concentrate on a simple model with the vacuum energy non - minimally coupled to the inflaton field , in which the coupling may arise from the conformal transformation , i.e. , transforming the brans - dicke theory from the jordan frame to the einstein one  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the inflaton coupled to the vacuum energy can be used to realize inflation with a small coupling constant  @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the vacuum energy begins with the planck mass scale and deflates by decaying to the inflaton in the pre - inflationary and inflationary epochs .",
    "the non - minimal coupling between the inflaton and vacuum plays the role of heating up the inflaton and triggers inflation , whereas inflation itself is driven by another slow - roll potential . after the reheating era",
    ", the inflaton decays to matter and decouples to the vacuum energy . as a result ,",
    "the residual vacuum energy density is much smaller than the matter one after inflation . at the late - time of the universe ,",
    "the vacuum energy is dominated again , known as dark energy . in this scenario ,",
    "the energy difference between the planck mass and current cosmological constant scale is determined by the inflaton potential and the coupling constant between the vacuum energy and inflaton field .",
    "we will show that the allowed range of the coupling constant is insensitive to the choice of the potentials so that our deflation scenario for @xmath0 is quite general .",
